WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:20.780
Tonight April 13, 2008, Brazil bans a popular video game, could BBC show soon be coming

00:20.780 --> 00:22.440
to the Nintendo Wii?

00:22.440 --> 00:27.440
And we interview Fards, the creator of Rom Check Fail.

00:27.440 --> 00:31.440
This is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.520
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.520 --> 00:36.520
Radio.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.040
A very special week for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.040 --> 00:44.000
That's right, it's the first week of us live and exclusive on AllGames.com.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.340
The old chapter of our Orange Lounge Radio feed on Live 365 closed as of yesterday and

00:49.340 --> 00:53.600
now we're on our new home at AllGames.com so a big hello to all of our new live listeners

00:53.600 --> 00:58.720
that we've got over at AllGames.com and hello to those of you still joining us, be it through

00:58.720 --> 01:02.520
the podcast feed or our old OLR faithful or what be you.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.280
Remember, you can always join our chat room to interact with the show.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.400
Just a quick footnote for the live folks, it is a different chat room than AllGames

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
usually uses.

01:09.400 --> 01:13.520
You're going to want to head over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com or if you're already on the Game Surge

01:13.520 --> 01:16.440
Network, you're going to want to use channel Orange Lounge.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.260
Alright let's go ahead and introduce the cast.

01:18.260 --> 01:23.100
My name is Rob Roberts but joining me as always, say hello to talk to me about the gaming news

01:23.100 --> 01:25.720
and make fun of it, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.720
Hi.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.640
When it deserves to be made fun of, correct?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
Or even when it doesn't.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.640
Alright, sounds good.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.280
I'm an equal opportunity make fun of her.

01:33.280 --> 01:34.280
Sounds good.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
How are you doing, DarkSakura?

01:35.280 --> 01:36.280
Meaty.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.280
Alright.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.280
I'm meaty today.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.280
Did you get your pastrami today?

01:39.280 --> 01:40.280
I have my pastrami.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.540
I have the ferret too.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.760
Very nice.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.000
Too much to Bobby's dismay, you do have the ferret here in the studio with us joining

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
us.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Hello.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
How you doing, Loki?

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Alright.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.600
And you're full of pizza, if I'm not mistaken.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.440
Uh, yeah, breadsticks and stuff.

01:58.440 --> 02:01.800
Yeah, when you came walking up to the door you had like two pizza boxes, I'm like damn

02:01.800 --> 02:04.800
Loki, you're fat.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.400
Fat with a pH, Loki.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.400
You know I love ya.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.960
But no, it was one pizza and one thing of breadsticks.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.000
By the way, we here at OLR, for those of you on all games who haven't heard our show before,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.280
we like food almost as much as we like video games.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.480
So there you have it.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.200
I especially like video games about food.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.120
Like cooking mama.

02:23.120 --> 02:29.920
You know how some people say that they like to, you know, watch porn while they do it?

02:29.920 --> 02:34.020
I like to eat food while I'm playing video games about food.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.600
So while you're like playing cooking mama, do you actually cook things that you're cooking

02:37.600 --> 02:38.600
in cooking mama?

02:38.600 --> 02:43.400
No, however, it did inspire me to try to make one of the dishes once.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.700
We should try that one night.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.960
We should do some, you know, cooking mama, like for reals.

02:47.960 --> 02:53.040
The instructions in that game are actually semi-realistic, given that those are, a lot

02:53.040 --> 02:57.320
of those dishes are stuff I make anyway, because I'm an awesome cook.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
And so humble.

02:58.320 --> 03:05.320
I know, I am, but it's the same type of thing, you know, the same situation, you know, to

03:05.320 --> 03:08.840
watch something and then, you know, participate, sort of.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.000
Well, we have a cooking mama related story tonight as well.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
We do.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.640
Sort of, distantly, but it is a cooking mama related thing.

03:15.640 --> 03:16.720
We'll get into that later.

03:16.720 --> 03:21.260
Also tonight we have Farbz, but you know him as the man behind Rom Check Fail, which was

03:21.260 --> 03:22.260
written by one man.

03:22.260 --> 03:25.080
We'll tell you more about that a little bit later on in the program.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.400
Also, we're live and streaming on Justin TV, if you want to see our ugly mugs on the cam.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.200
We're over there at Justin TV, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.080
But we're going to start off tonight's show as we always do, talking a little bit about

03:35.080 --> 03:36.080
our gaming weeks.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.960
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.440
It was meaty, no.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.440
So meaty.

03:42.440 --> 03:47.560
Now, my gaming week was actually, I know I always say it's pinball oriented, but this

03:47.560 --> 03:50.160
week was especially pinball oriented.

03:50.160 --> 03:56.680
Because Dan is hosting his pinball group gathering tonight.

03:56.680 --> 04:01.940
Hence another reason why I, you know, feel very blessed to be here tonight.

04:01.940 --> 04:06.600
So I had to be around loud stranger men that I don't know.

04:06.600 --> 04:12.600
Anyway, so a lot of the week was actually spent testing out after shopping out some

04:12.600 --> 04:13.960
of the tables.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.480
We've had his friend Will's Judge Dredd torn apart all over our garage right now and they

04:18.480 --> 04:21.240
just put it back together today and I hate that table.

04:21.240 --> 04:29.440
Anyway, we also went to one of our local used movie CD places called Dimple and we almost

04:29.440 --> 04:31.720
picked up some 7800 games.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.440
But then we remembered that we probably already owned them.

04:34.440 --> 04:39.960
Because the way you know that you have too much in your collection is when you have to

04:39.960 --> 04:45.160
actually stop and ask yourself, do I own this or even worse, how many copies of this do

04:45.160 --> 04:47.320
I already have?

04:47.320 --> 04:50.880
I've come home with a game for Dan and now the unique thing about it is that I did have

04:50.880 --> 04:51.880
the manual in the box.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.160
It's a 5200 game.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.560
We had three other copies of it.

04:56.560 --> 05:00.400
You need to get one of those little personal organizers just for your video game collection

05:00.400 --> 05:03.220
so you can actually pull up an Excel spreadsheet on the go.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.640
Do I have this game?

05:04.640 --> 05:05.920
Does it have the manual with it?

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
Yes or no?

05:06.920 --> 05:10.820
That's a pretty hardcore video game collector.

05:10.820 --> 05:15.200
We actually did have a list like that for a while and then I think we lost it in a computer

05:15.200 --> 05:20.760
crash and then we just were sort of like, you've seen our vault.

05:20.760 --> 05:29.240
We have an entire room dedicated to the collection and it's sort of overwhelming now.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.240
Actually a lot overwhelming.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.120
Have you ever thought like, one of these days we just need to get rid of this shit.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.200
We need to call the 1-800 got junk people or whatever it is.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
Bite your tongue.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.200
Ow.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.200
It has been bitten.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.560
Dan has said that we should get rid of some of it and I'm like, you touch that collection

05:43.560 --> 05:52.000
I kill you and then when you're dead it's all mine.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.520
He'll divorce him when he's dead and then take over the collection.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.800
Well when he's dead I'm actually putting him in his Mustang driving it off a cliff and

05:57.800 --> 05:59.240
exploding it in mid-air.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
That's what he wants.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.000
I am the best wife ever.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.640
Something tells me you're out of video games to talk about so we're going to move over

06:06.640 --> 06:10.960
to, now she's like talking about these Thelma and Louise inspired things, I don't know,

06:10.960 --> 06:11.960
so we're going to go over.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
What's this idea?

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Loki.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.520
Do I want to buy a Virtual Boy system?

06:16.520 --> 06:17.520
That's what I need to know.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.400
Yes, you do want a Virtual Boy system.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.560
How much do they want for it?

06:21.560 --> 06:22.560
$75.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.200
No, actually wait I'm sorry I read that wrong.

06:25.200 --> 06:29.600
I would be about $84.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.760
Is that something you're looking at on eBay right now or something?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.760
Yes.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.960
Well now that you just said that on air everybody else is going to go look that up and jack

06:36.960 --> 06:37.960
the price up.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.960
Let's buy it now.

06:38.960 --> 06:39.960
Oh, buy it now.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.560
I don't know, it's a piece of gaming history.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.800
I have the Vectrex too and I can't turn it, see I want a game system that I can leave

06:47.800 --> 06:52.240
running on my desk all day long so people can come and play it but the Vectrex makes

06:52.240 --> 06:59.720
it really loud like the entire time that it's going so that and there's no real like demo

06:59.720 --> 07:03.560
loop or anything it just keeps playing the game over and over until you actually touch

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
it.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.560
Isn't that a demo loop?

07:05.560 --> 07:11.800
No, because you have to play in other words you keep dying because there's no demo loop

07:11.800 --> 07:12.940
but.

07:12.940 --> 07:16.360
Have you ever thought of actually just like building like a mock cabinet and having to

07:16.360 --> 07:18.720
something that cycles like an emulator?

07:18.720 --> 07:23.360
No, I don't want to build a cabinet for my desk because I think they'd be like what the

07:23.360 --> 07:24.800
hell's that?

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
In the office.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.040
It's my new arcade cabinet.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.040
Don't touch my arcade cabinet.

07:29.040 --> 07:30.600
No, but actually stuff that I played this week.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.160
I was going to say, you know, we here on Orange Launch Radio, we like to stay on the current

07:34.160 --> 07:38.200
news too, not just, you know, Virtual Boys and Atari 7800s, have you been playing like

07:38.200 --> 07:41.280
360, Wii, any of that stuff?

07:41.280 --> 07:44.960
This week I've only played two things, unfortunately.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.420
First one of course is multiplayer Saints Rokes.

07:47.420 --> 07:51.400
We're still playing that damn game until we can get Grand Theft Auto IV, which I did find

07:51.400 --> 07:57.760
out today, well not today, but earlier this week that my boss is going to buy me a special

07:57.760 --> 08:01.640
edition of Grand Theft Auto IV, so that's awesome, but at the same time I already preordered

08:01.640 --> 08:05.940
another one just because, you know, we're going to need some for multiplayer.

08:05.940 --> 08:11.640
And I think I need about two to three more copies on top of those too, so five somewhere

08:11.640 --> 08:12.640
around there.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.280
That reminds me I still have to fix my other 360.

08:16.280 --> 08:23.320
And then, other than Saints Row, I did play Mario Kart Wii, a lot of Mario Kart Wii, in

08:23.320 --> 08:32.600
fact I've already finished 50cc and 100cc, of course imported from the UK.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.040
And well, what can I say about the game, it's Mario Kart.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.560
I like some of the new levels that are in there, I think they're really cool.

08:39.560 --> 08:43.760
The only thing that, a couple gripes I have about the game, some of the levels that they

08:43.760 --> 08:48.840
chose, like the classic levels, are kind of stupid choices.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.600
They're not, well Rainbow Road's kind of annoying, but you know, that's just Rainbow Road, but

08:52.600 --> 08:56.480
a lot of the like, especially even the battle modes, like the battle courses that they chose

08:56.480 --> 08:58.220
are just kind of crappy.

08:58.220 --> 08:59.800
Which Rainbow Road did they bring over?

08:59.800 --> 09:03.480
They have the new Rainbow Road, there is no older one.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.480
And it's annoying.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.360
Well Rainbow Road always is.

09:06.360 --> 09:11.280
No, but like some of the battle courses that they brought over, they brought over like,

09:11.280 --> 09:15.000
I don't know, just some of the lamest ones from the other games.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.880
And I really think they could have chose some better tracks as well from like the classic

09:19.880 --> 09:20.880
stuff.

09:20.880 --> 09:24.720
Because there's a lot that just kind of resemble other tracks in the game that are already

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
there.

09:25.720 --> 09:30.320
I mean there's three tracks that are kind of like the Donkey Kong, what was it, the

09:30.320 --> 09:32.640
one from Double Dash.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.680
They're kind of like that, where you have the giant cannon that launches you to the

09:36.680 --> 09:39.680
top of the track and you race down back to the cannon and stuff.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.000
So it's alright.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.280
Some other weird gripes about it.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.440
Battle mode is only team based.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.640
You cannot play against, you know, individual people.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.640
What?

09:51.640 --> 09:52.640
Yeah.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.760
You can only play against, you have to be on one team or the other.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.560
So if you have three people or four people and you want to battle each other, well you

09:58.560 --> 09:59.560
can't.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.360
You have to be on two man teams.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.360
That sucks.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.360
Yeah, it's retarded.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.360
I wonder why they did that.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.920
You would think that's something that, you know, doesn't take a whole lot of extra programming.

10:07.920 --> 10:08.920
Oh yeah.

10:08.920 --> 10:09.920
It's lazy.

10:09.920 --> 10:10.920
That's all it is.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.920
Interesting.

10:11.920 --> 10:12.920
That's a weird change.

10:12.920 --> 10:13.920
Yeah.

10:13.920 --> 10:14.920
So that sucks.

10:14.920 --> 10:19.600
Other than that though, you can customize a lot of stuff in there, like different item

10:19.600 --> 10:20.600
drops.

10:20.600 --> 10:26.860
But, you know, I tried some of the ones that drop like the really supposedly big items,

10:26.860 --> 10:32.440
like the more powerful items more frequently versus the normal drops and I didn't notice

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
a difference.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.600
So I don't know.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.400
It's not very useful.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.480
But tried online a little bit.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.400
I was hardly able to get into any games right now.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.440
Online is kind of crappy as far as connecting to a game, but once you're in the game, it's

10:45.440 --> 10:46.720
fine.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.680
I like the way that they have it where you pick courses and stuff.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.000
You basically choose a course that you want, then the computer randomly selects which player's

10:55.000 --> 10:56.620
choice gets picked and stuff.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.620
So that's kind of neat.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.680
Now obviously you have no friends to play against right now, right?

10:59.680 --> 11:00.680
So you're just playing the...

11:00.680 --> 11:01.860
I'm just playing against random people worldwide.

11:01.860 --> 11:02.860
And it's working okay?

11:02.860 --> 11:04.320
I'm surprised there's enough people on there.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.320
But I guess since the game's...

11:05.320 --> 11:06.320
No, there's a ton of people on there.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.800
Since the game's out in the UK and stuff.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.040
It's out in the UK and Japan already.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.800
Two-thirds of the world has it, but just not the US yet.

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
But yeah, it's okay.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.520
I'm not very good at...

11:18.520 --> 11:25.960
I like playing as Yoshi or the medium karts, so it's not very fast and I get beat pretty

11:25.960 --> 11:27.360
quick sometimes.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.000
But I like the tracks.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.480
Some of the meat integration in the game is pretty funny, especially there's a mall level

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
that you play in.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.240
And there's a bunch of signs and stuff that are all throughout the mall with different

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
Miis on there.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.240
And it's randomly selected each time you play the game.

11:42.240 --> 11:47.200
So there was one that I was driving through the very first time I played at the mall.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.560
My Chuck Norris Mii was on the coffee.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.560
There's a coffee advertisement.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.320
And then there's another one with Jesus on there.

11:54.320 --> 11:59.080
And then later on in the level you saw Hitler driving a car and stuff.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.880
Just absolutely funny stuff.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.880
Nice.

12:01.880 --> 12:06.480
And there's Goat Say Mii driving a car one time, but for some reason it likes selecting

12:06.480 --> 12:08.360
Saddam and Hitler Miis.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.280
I don't know why, but I see them the most frequent.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.600
Did you get the Bobby Black Wolf Mii to show up at some point?

12:13.600 --> 12:17.760
Like, you know, Saddam, Hitler, and Bobby Black Wolf all driving cars with the Goat

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
Say?

12:18.760 --> 12:19.760
Goat Say Man?

12:19.760 --> 12:23.560
You know, he might have been in there somewhere, but I don't remember exactly what his Mii

12:23.560 --> 12:25.960
looks like, so I have to see.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.080
It looks like him, dummy!

12:27.080 --> 12:31.040
Well, I know it looks like him, duh, but I have a ton of Miis and, you know, they all

12:31.040 --> 12:35.160
kind of look similar to different things, so, you know, it's hard to pick out.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.560
I'm like, is that Rob, or is that Shane?

12:37.560 --> 12:38.880
I'm not sure, you know.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.520
Well, let's get this thing.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.200
Shane, black hair, Rob, reddish-brown hair.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.200
It's not that hard.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
Well, you're driving my stuff really fast, okay?

12:45.200 --> 12:47.120
You can't just, like, stop and, like, hmm.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.120
I think that my Mii is very recognizable, but then again she's also scowling.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.120
Yeah, yeah.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
I love Dark Soccer's Mii.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.120
Her Mii was in a car one time, so that was funny.

12:56.120 --> 12:59.760
Dark Soccer's Mii always looks angry, because she picked the little pointy eyebrows to make

12:59.760 --> 13:01.560
her look mad all the time, which is great.

13:01.560 --> 13:07.800
So yeah, you can play the game, and then eventually you unlock the Mii, the drive S, which, here's

13:07.800 --> 13:12.200
my other gripe, and I haven't, I could be wrong about this, but I haven't tried multiplayer

13:12.200 --> 13:14.120
with it yet.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.960
In single player, when you're playing as the Mii character, you can't select which Mii

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
it uses.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.400
It's only the one that you assign to your license.

13:21.400 --> 13:26.840
So you can't swap it between other things, which is another lazy thing that they've done.

13:26.840 --> 13:31.360
And it also has the most retarded voice I've ever heard for a character.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.240
It's like a retarded Mario voice.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.800
It's like, ehhhhh.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.980
It's like, what the hell is that?

13:38.980 --> 13:40.880
It sounds like goat boy Mii or something.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.120
What the hell is that?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
I don't know, but hopefully...

13:43.120 --> 13:45.120
Can you make that sound again for us?

13:45.120 --> 13:46.120
Ehhhhh.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
There you go.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.920
So I don't know.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.920
I like the game.

13:49.920 --> 13:55.440
I like it a lot better than Smash Brothers, but I love Mario Kart, so what can I say?

13:55.440 --> 13:59.360
Well Bobby is in chat right now at chat.orangelaundry.com, defending himself a little bit.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.280
We'll let him have the first comment on allgames.com, because he is the show that precedes us after

14:03.280 --> 14:07.640
all over on allgames.com, Bobby Black Wolf Show, which starts an hour before we do here

14:07.640 --> 14:08.640
on allgames.com.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.560
He says, my Mii looks like Jesus to some people, so maybe when you were driving by really fast,

14:13.560 --> 14:16.880
what actually you thought was Jesus was just Bobby.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
It could have been.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
Possibly.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.720
Looking at some other comments, some folks were talking about Mario Kart Double Dash,

14:21.720 --> 14:25.040
because not everybody's played Mario Kart Wii yet, obviously, so it's been inspiring

14:25.040 --> 14:30.160
some talk about Mario Kart Double Dash, and Osfer speaking up for Double Dash, saying

14:30.160 --> 14:35.080
Double Dash was some fun shit, and Sephiroth1215 saying, yeah, see, I really don't understand

14:35.080 --> 14:37.600
why people don't like Double Dash.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.600
It was okay.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.600
It's just, okay.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.480
The thing I didn't like about Double Dash is the battle mode really sucked.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.760
Like the levels that they made for it just awful.

14:45.760 --> 14:50.880
And even some of the levels in, oh that's the other thing too about, and I, you know,

14:50.880 --> 14:55.920
I don't remember the other Mario games too well, the Mario Kart games, but from what

14:55.920 --> 15:02.440
I remember before, you didn't have a point limit or a time limit, so in the battle mode

15:02.440 --> 15:06.000
this time, you have a three minute time limit for each game that you play.

15:06.000 --> 15:12.280
You can't just keep playing until, you know, someone loses, which is kind of lame.

15:12.280 --> 15:16.280
And when you lose all your balloons, you just get them all back, and it just keeps counting

15:16.280 --> 15:19.440
more scores, so the balloons are kind of pointless too.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.440
Interesting.

15:20.440 --> 15:21.440
Yeah.

15:21.440 --> 15:25.440
But I like what they've done with the levels, like where you can go up like half pipes almost

15:25.440 --> 15:26.560
and do tricks and stuff.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.740
That's pretty cool.

15:27.740 --> 15:30.100
And there are some, you know, neat things.

15:30.100 --> 15:33.560
The motorcycles I don't really dig very much.

15:33.560 --> 15:37.720
I think that's kind of a dumb addition, and I tried playing it the steering wheel method,

15:37.720 --> 15:38.720
and I hate it.

15:38.720 --> 15:39.720
It's awful.

15:39.720 --> 15:44.240
But the good news is though, for those that may have heard different stories claiming

15:44.240 --> 15:47.600
otherwise, the classic controller and the GameCube controller are not gimped in any

15:47.600 --> 15:51.320
way whatsoever, so you can play them just fine with it.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.320
Really?

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
In fact, I use the classic controller.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.200
But I mentioned there's got to be a huge difference between using an analog stick to control something

15:56.200 --> 15:57.200
and using the motion.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.400
There's got to be a huge difference.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.400
Yeah.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.400
I don't like the motion at all.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.400
Interesting.

16:01.400 --> 16:06.400
And doing all the gestures that do different things, it's not very fun, so I prefer the

16:06.400 --> 16:07.920
classic controller of the GameCube.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.520
Okay, so to kind of sum up this game review here that you're ending up giving us on Mario

16:11.520 --> 16:12.520
Kart Wii, what would you say?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.120
Is it better than Double Dash?

16:14.120 --> 16:15.840
Are fans of Mario Kart going to like it?

16:15.840 --> 16:16.840
Do you recommend it?

16:16.840 --> 16:21.000
Yeah, I'd say it's better than Double Dash because it doesn't have two characters anymore

16:21.000 --> 16:23.160
and that kind of is stupid in the first place.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.720
And they killed Toadette off, hopefully.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720
Yeah, I think so.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.720
I can't stand Toadette.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
Toadette sucks.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.920
Definitely, if you like Mario Kart, you're going to like this game.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.760
The fact that it has online is going to be pretty cool.

16:34.760 --> 16:39.040
There has been some cheating online, but we'll get into that a little bit later.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.500
Thankfully they fixed that.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.520
But I don't know, overall it's a pretty cool game.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.040
I just wish there were some better tracks.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.640
Some of the classic tracks that they picked were kind of stupid.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.900
Just like kind of, well this track's easy, the remake, so let's just pick this one instead

16:54.900 --> 16:56.880
of actually picking good tracks.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.840
That's my only gripe.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.240
But other than that, it is an awesome game.

17:01.240 --> 17:02.240
Alright.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.920
Well, moving on to my gaming week, I was just bitching at Loki for talking about classics

17:06.920 --> 17:10.080
too much, but that's actually kind of what I ended up playing this week because if you

17:10.080 --> 17:13.000
were listening last week, you know I've been sick for a little while now and I was actually

17:13.000 --> 17:14.880
at my parents' house this week recovering.

17:14.880 --> 17:19.920
And so there are no video games in my parents' place and I lost my freaking DS charger.

17:19.920 --> 17:20.920
And here's the weird thing.

17:20.920 --> 17:24.920
Do you know that Target and Walmart, both those stores, they do not carry DS chargers.

17:24.920 --> 17:30.360
They carry the car chargers, but they don't carry the ones you can plug in the wall.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.800
And I wasn't able to convince them to take me over to a GameStop or whatever, so I was

17:33.800 --> 17:36.760
just like, alright, so I'm just gonna, I guess, watch TV.

17:36.760 --> 17:41.480
And then it dawned on me, even though my parents, they only have a 56.6K dial-up connection

17:41.480 --> 17:42.480
to the internet.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.960
Oh my god, so slow.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.340
When you're spoiled with broadband.

17:45.340 --> 17:47.480
But they have the 56.6K connection to the internet.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.840
I downloaded emulators.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.680
And so I went to town on some Super Nintendo games I'd missed and the one I probably played

17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
the most of was Soul Blazer.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.960
I don't know if you guys remember this game at all.

17:55.960 --> 17:59.800
It was kind of in that same series-ish that Illusion of Gaia and Terranigma and some of

17:59.800 --> 18:00.800
these other games were.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.800
I remember.

18:01.800 --> 18:07.320
Soul Blazer was like the first in that game by Enix, you know, way back in the day.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.560
Basically you could kind of call it a Zelda-ish type of game.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.800
You go in these action stages and as you kill these monsters that come out of the lair,

18:15.800 --> 18:19.480
you free souls that might unlock something in the town.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.920
But the towns and the dungeons are sort of related.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.600
So like, you know, like in the dungeon, for instance, there's one part where an elevator

18:25.600 --> 18:26.840
is broken and it doesn't work.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.920
Well you have to release the soul of the man who runs the water well to get him to start

18:30.920 --> 18:33.400
the water well again so the elevator works.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.740
There's weird little connections like that.

18:34.740 --> 18:38.820
But the game has a surprising amount of depth to it with the story for a Super Nintendo

18:38.820 --> 18:39.820
game.

18:39.820 --> 18:44.400
I'm reviewing a classic, but it is one of my all-time favorite Super Nintendo games.

18:44.400 --> 18:49.480
Because in the story, the hero can talk to, he's kind of like a servant of God, quote

18:49.480 --> 18:55.960
unquote, whatever you want to call it, and he can talk to dogs and cats and goats and

18:55.960 --> 18:58.080
plants the same way that he talks to humans.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.160
So it's very interesting the way they've written the story.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.160
Do you know the cleric?

19:01.160 --> 19:03.880
Sort of, but I don't think that's what he's called in the game.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.920
He's just a hero is what he's called.

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
He's a goat whisperer.

19:07.920 --> 19:11.960
Well in my game, he was called Butters because you can name him whatever you want, so I named

19:11.960 --> 19:14.160
him Butters because I like that name.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.480
So yeah, so I played a lot of Soul Blazer this week.

19:17.480 --> 19:22.680
And otherwise, as far as newer games go, I went back to an MMO this week that I haven't

19:22.680 --> 19:23.680
played in a while.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.600
I hope it's not Final Fantasy XI.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.720
It is not Final Fantasy XI.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.000
But you would still be surprised.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.240
You know what MMO I played this week that I haven't played?

19:31.240 --> 19:32.240
PSN Blue Burst?

19:32.240 --> 19:33.240
Close.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.240
Phantasy Star Universe.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
Julie said she saw you on.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.680
Yep, I played Phantasy Star Universe for a little while.

19:37.680 --> 19:41.200
She came over to show me the free server she's playing on for Blue Burst.

19:41.200 --> 19:45.700
Sega apparently is cool with people being on the free servers now and has character

19:45.700 --> 19:46.700
transfer tools.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.400
Dang, that's kind of rad.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.400
Yeah.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
That's nice of them.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.320
But she said she saw you on.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
Yes.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
Rob's playing PSU again?

19:54.320 --> 19:55.320
Cool.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.320
I need to play with him.

19:56.320 --> 20:01.040
I actually downloaded the expansion, the Ambition of the Illuminous, or whatever it's called.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.480
I've always jokingly called it the abortion of the Illuminous.

20:03.480 --> 20:04.480
Well not on Xbox 360.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.480
You can't get it.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
Really?

20:06.480 --> 20:07.480
I could have gotten it free for free.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.480
Alright, that's alright.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.360
I got it anyway.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.240
I haven't gotten to explore it a whole lot, but I will say this.

20:13.240 --> 20:18.320
I've kind of enjoyed the way that the online story, because the game's changed a lot since

20:18.320 --> 20:21.440
I last, because I played for about a month after it first came out, and then I just stopped

20:21.440 --> 20:22.440
because I was kind of getting old.

20:22.440 --> 20:26.480
It felt like the same grind over and over, but they've really expanded a story that begins

20:26.480 --> 20:32.320
on the disc of the game, Phantasy Star Universe, is this very anime style story with this grand

20:32.320 --> 20:33.840
introduction and everything.

20:33.840 --> 20:38.040
The neat thing about PSU is that it keeps expanding the story on in the online mode,

20:38.040 --> 20:44.680
so you literally start chapter two or the second series online, and it's a continuation

20:44.680 --> 20:45.840
of the first series.

20:45.840 --> 20:49.900
And then this whole Ambition of the Illuminous is the third series, and it even comes with

20:49.900 --> 20:54.000
its own cutscenes, new introduction, and all this other cool stuff.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.160
So I thought it was kind of interesting.

20:57.160 --> 21:01.160
I have not yet though gotten the mag and all this other stuff that supposedly PSU is bringing

21:01.160 --> 21:03.840
back some of the old school stuff from Phantasy Star Online, but I'm not that far enough yet.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.880
They've got the original four stages too.

21:05.880 --> 21:10.280
I know that the people that are probably, if you're looking to play this game and you

21:10.280 --> 21:12.040
haven't done it yet, it's like 20 bucks now.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
It's very cheap.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.360
And Rob, kaths can use four skills now.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.680
It's about time.

21:19.680 --> 21:25.320
Speaking of crack that I used to be on gaming-wise, speaking of Final Fantasy XI as well, I also

21:25.320 --> 21:29.960
noticed, I didn't realize this came out, there's a new combo disc that came out for the Xbox

21:29.960 --> 21:34.720
360 that combines Final Fantasy XI and every single expansion, including the new Wings

21:34.720 --> 21:37.840
of the Goddess, only $29.99 on Xbox 360.

21:37.840 --> 21:41.200
Not too bad of a deal, I got to say, if you want to get sucked into that crack.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.680
So you have several MMO crack things to choose from on the Xbox 360.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.400
All right, that's going to do it for our gaming week.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.640
That was quite a bit tonight, but we had a lot of games to talk about.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.640
Let's talk about some housekeeping news.

21:51.640 --> 21:55.720
Of course, last night the plug was pulled on our Live 365 feed.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.880
It's no longer there.

21:57.880 --> 22:01.920
Gaming and Live 365, oh my god.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.520
I wrote them a cancellation email a week ago.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.520
You're supposed to give them three business days to cancel, right?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.680
I wrote them an email a week ago, no response.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.760
Wrote them a second notice, like Thursday or Friday, no response.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.400
Guess who charged my card today?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
The butt heads.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.880
This is a fun ever start.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.160
I'll keep you guys posted next week, what happens with that?

22:20.160 --> 22:25.040
We might have to get nasty if things keep going down this route, because essentially

22:25.040 --> 22:27.880
they've taken money from me that I didn't pay for.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.400
It's kind of pissing me off.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.260
Call your bank and stop payment.

22:32.260 --> 22:36.720
So hello to AllGames.com, our new home, which has deducted no money from my bank account

22:36.720 --> 22:41.700
this week, thankfully, because there are great people over at AllGames.com who aren't sucking

22:41.700 --> 22:45.480
my money away, and they're friends, and we definitely urge you to check out the programming

22:45.480 --> 22:46.900
that's at AllGames.com.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.920
They have something new every night.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.200
They re-air a bunch of podcasts that go on throughout the week.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.840
Some of them have their debut on All Games Radio, so check that out.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.760
We debut, of course, Sunday nights before us, Bobby Black Wolf.

22:58.760 --> 23:03.520
In the morning times, All Games Interactive is on like every day, Monday through Friday.

23:03.520 --> 23:08.200
So that shows on, I think, like 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and they go through most of the morning,

23:08.200 --> 23:11.240
which would be actually early afternoon for the East Coast folks, so it really works out

23:11.240 --> 23:15.400
great for the East Coast folks who have to stay up really late to listen to us.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.080
And again, we want to remind you, we have a special guest tonight, Farbz of Romcheck

23:19.080 --> 23:23.080
Fail fame, and if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you want to get to know us a little better,

23:23.080 --> 23:25.000
join our social networking.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That's right.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.320
We're MySpace whores just like everybody else, and Facebook and all that other stuff.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.080
Our MySpace is MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

23:31.080 --> 23:35.560
We also have a live journal community at Orange Lounge, no radio, and Facebook.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.880
Just search for OL Army, and you can add us on all those sites, and stay tuned with all

23:39.880 --> 23:44.140
the news, and when we shift networks and all that stuff, you'll be on top of things and

23:44.140 --> 23:45.140
know where to catch us.

23:45.140 --> 23:49.920
Apparently, the chat room is loving the new sound, by the way, because our feed now is

23:49.920 --> 23:56.920
96k, so it's a lot clearer, the feed, than the 64k we were on with Live 365, so they're

23:56.920 --> 23:58.200
really happy with that.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.600
And I think our podcast listeners are going to notice we also changed the audio on the

24:01.600 --> 24:06.360
podcast to be similar to what we're broadcasting at now, so it's going to be a whole new sound.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
That's okay, Rob.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.360
I'll just talk like this.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.360
We'll ruin the audio quality of the show this way.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.360
Yeah, we'll just do it this way.

24:13.360 --> 24:19.000
Alright, how about you get into some great new news tonight, will ya, ladies and gentlemen?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.120
Anyways, let's see.

24:20.120 --> 24:26.600
So this week, the publisher of Famitsu Magazine thinks that they have an idea of what may

24:26.600 --> 24:30.200
be happening in E3 this year, one of the announcements.

24:30.200 --> 24:37.200
Their guess is that Nintendo is going to be announcing yet another revision of the DS,

24:37.200 --> 24:41.720
and their thinking behind this is because the timing seems to be right.

24:41.720 --> 24:48.440
Apparently, every two years or so is when they revise their portable systems.

24:48.440 --> 24:56.540
So for example, there is the 1996 Game Boy Pocket, and then in 98 there was the Game

24:56.540 --> 25:01.640
Boy Color, and then of course in 2001 there was the Game Boy Advance, in 2003 there was

25:01.640 --> 25:09.600
the Game Boy Advance SP, in 2004 there was DS, and then in 2006 there was DS Lite, so

25:09.600 --> 25:16.360
2008, obviously since the DS is doing extremely well, they wouldn't probably introduce a new

25:16.360 --> 25:22.440
system, but maybe another revision, maybe a yet slimmer and something with storage that

25:22.440 --> 25:26.080
could possibly download something off the Virtual Console or something like that.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.640
The DS Micro.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
Who knows?

25:28.640 --> 25:31.520
Or maybe they'll just do nothing and won't they feel stupid.

25:31.520 --> 25:36.960
Okay, so in other words, Famitsu Magazine is basically saying this, Nintendo likes to

25:36.960 --> 25:40.640
redo shit and make you buy it all over again, all the time.

25:40.640 --> 25:45.680
So 2008 will be nothing new, is essentially what they're saying, and this is news how?

25:45.680 --> 25:47.680
I don't know.

25:47.680 --> 25:54.680
It's news because, I don't know, because we're talking about E3, and people like talking

25:54.680 --> 25:55.680
about E3.

25:55.680 --> 26:01.520
Odd1 says, but this time it's got, what the hell else can they do to this thing other

26:01.520 --> 26:03.880
than make it smaller or give it storage?

26:03.880 --> 26:05.560
Ah, there's a thought.

26:05.560 --> 26:11.520
What about turning the DS a little bit PSP-ish, where, hey, not only is it a DS, but it plays

26:11.520 --> 26:14.200
MP3s and it has scheduling things.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.160
I would refuse to buy one if it does that.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.160
Or here's something...

26:17.160 --> 26:18.160
Wait, wait.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.160
I gotta know this.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.160
Why is that?

26:20.160 --> 26:21.940
Because it's the same reason why I'm not too fond of the PSP.

26:21.940 --> 26:23.440
It's got way too much shit in it.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.840
If I want to play a game, I want a system that plays a game.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.720
I have an iPhone already, hello?

26:28.720 --> 26:29.720
I have to be honest.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.320
That's kind of one thing I like about the PSP is that it's a little bit of everything.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.320
You know what I mean?

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
I think it's kind of neat.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.720
If you want your video game system to have everything, then that's fine.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.120
If that's what you want.

26:40.120 --> 26:45.640
But for me personally, because I already have the means to do all this other stuff, I really

26:45.640 --> 26:48.080
just want my system to play my video games.

26:48.080 --> 26:55.100
Here's something, a thought, and I could see this happening more than I could see, say,

26:55.100 --> 26:56.680
a new system coming out.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.880
Maybe an expansion that would plug into the bottom of the Game Boy Advance slot or whatever,

27:00.880 --> 27:04.400
and you would plug in your SD memory card because, guess what, you have an SD memory

27:04.400 --> 27:10.760
card slot on your Wii and so maybe this, I don't know, device or whatever that you plug

27:10.760 --> 27:16.800
into the bottom, that is flashable and that you can have firmware upgrades to and whatnot

27:16.800 --> 27:22.640
to allow it to play, like say, emulate different games like the Virtual Console or stuff like

27:22.640 --> 27:25.960
that or WiiWare or something like that.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.520
I could see that happening because that would be a little easier.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.880
They can't just get rid of, like if they make it any slimmer, they're going to get rid of

27:31.880 --> 27:35.280
the Game Boy Advance slot, then you're going to have stuff that uses it, like say Guitar

27:35.280 --> 27:39.440
Hero on Tour, I don't know if they're going to screw that over because that would be good

27:39.440 --> 27:44.600
for them, they can't get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot just yet.

27:44.600 --> 27:50.560
It's an interesting thought, but why would they do this when they could release games

27:50.560 --> 27:54.000
on the, I mean they did this for the Game Boy Advance, they released their classic series

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
games.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.480
Remember the classic series games that came out on the Game Boy Advance?

27:58.480 --> 28:02.140
Like you could get classic Donkey Kong or classic Metroid even though you could unlock

28:02.140 --> 28:04.220
it in another game, right?

28:04.220 --> 28:07.080
You get these classic games and they were charging like $19.99 for them.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.120
So why would they give you a device where you could get all this shit basically for

28:10.120 --> 28:15.120
free from the Virtual Console when they could recharge for it and people would buy it?

28:15.120 --> 28:16.960
Well, because I don't think people would buy it.

28:16.960 --> 28:22.040
I think people would rather have a service available where they can download all these

28:22.040 --> 28:27.100
games, and I think you get a lot more people downloading games, it's a lot easier to download

28:27.100 --> 28:30.480
games on the Virtual Console and pay a lot more money that way.

28:30.480 --> 28:36.320
That also saves them packaging, they don't have to press any of these stupid cartridges.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.560
I think the packaging and stuff, that would save them a lot of money, and it doesn't really

28:39.560 --> 28:42.400
cost them anything to transfer a file.

28:42.400 --> 28:48.880
It's just, you know, basically what they're gonna probably want to do is prevent people

28:48.880 --> 28:51.320
from pirating this stuff, and that's about it.

28:51.320 --> 28:57.200
Because, you know, right now with those other SD memory card things, yeah, you can pirate

28:57.200 --> 29:02.200
games like, you know, no end, but they'd have to create something that you wouldn't be able

29:02.200 --> 29:04.200
to do that.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.200
Well we'll see what happens.

29:05.200 --> 29:08.080
And besides, think of all the other things you could do, I mean, it's essentially just

29:08.080 --> 29:13.560
like that PlayOn thing that they have available now, you could use it as Game Boy, you know,

29:13.560 --> 29:18.700
not necessarily for Virtual Console games and stuff like that, MP3s, you can use it

29:18.700 --> 29:23.160
for like maybe small media files, you know, playing a really, really, really low res movie

29:23.160 --> 29:29.920
or something like that, you know, like think, I don't know, your cartoons.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.840
They had that on the Game Boy Advance, remember those?

29:31.840 --> 29:35.560
They still sell those at like Walmart and stuff, you can get the couple episodes of

29:35.560 --> 29:39.120
Kim Possible or whatever on an Advance cart, and you can watch those movies.

29:39.120 --> 29:43.240
Or, you know, just like an iPod, you know, Nano or something like that with a tiny ass

29:43.240 --> 29:46.840
screen on it, you know, you can do something like that.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.400
As long as it shuts the kids up in the backseat of the car, right?

29:49.400 --> 29:50.400
Exactly.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.280
Well this is something that will shut a lot of people up for a while, it's Final Fantasy

29:53.280 --> 29:55.880
4, and the reason why I say that is because once you start playing this game, you get

29:55.880 --> 29:57.420
sucked into it for a while.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.120
It's a pretty epic RPG, one of my favorites on the Super Nintendo.

30:00.120 --> 30:03.740
I can't wait to play the new version on the DS, and we talked about this a little bit

30:03.740 --> 30:08.020
last week, and this is a bit of a follow-up, is that there was a rumor that Final Fantasy

30:08.020 --> 30:11.240
4 was, yes, it's going to be North American bound because it showed up on the cover, Nintendo

30:11.240 --> 30:16.080
Power and all this stuff, well Squeenix confirmed it this week, Final Fantasy 4 will be coming

30:16.080 --> 30:21.200
out July 22nd in North America, which is a little bit off from the date I seem to recall

30:21.200 --> 30:22.200
Loki mentioning.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.080
Well, they revised it, bumped it up a week.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.520
All because of you, probably, right?

30:25.520 --> 30:26.520
Yeah.

30:26.520 --> 30:27.520
Just kidding.

30:27.520 --> 30:31.580
It is, of course, Final Fantasy 4 with some graphical upgrades, they also have, get this

30:31.580 --> 30:37.640
fully voiced cutscenes and other added content, so that's going to be interesting, this whole

30:37.640 --> 30:38.640
mini movie thing.

30:38.640 --> 30:43.400
And then my mistake from last week, it wasn't Dragon Quest V, it was Dragon Quest IV.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.320
Oh, okay.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.160
That is also on its way, but that's secret type thing, right?

30:48.160 --> 30:49.160
Shhh.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.160
Secret.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.160
Secret.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.160
Okay.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.200
All right, so we'll see what happens next from Squeenix, I guess that's probably why

30:55.200 --> 30:58.440
this game has taken a long time to come out from Japan to the US is because they're having

30:58.440 --> 31:02.360
to redo the voices now too, which I'm sure can't be an easy thing on the DS because then

31:02.360 --> 31:07.320
they have to go basically remake the whole cartridges and all that, so please voice acting,

31:07.320 --> 31:11.800
don't suck in this, please do not ruin my fond fond memories of Final Fantasy 4 or I'll

31:11.800 --> 31:12.800
cry.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.440
I don't know why they can't leave it intact.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.440
But no.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.440
But no.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.860
Maybe the classic version will be in there somewhere, I don't know.

31:19.860 --> 31:20.860
One can hope.

31:20.860 --> 31:27.280
Well, at any rate, something else that has made a lot of people on the internet go Squee,

31:27.280 --> 31:32.840
is a, but not Squeenix, okay, is a strong bad game coming to WiiWare, and I am very

31:32.840 --> 31:33.840
happy about this.

31:33.840 --> 31:34.840
Did you watch the trailer?

31:34.840 --> 31:39.560
I have not seen the trailer yet, remember I was on 56.6K most of the week.

31:39.560 --> 31:45.400
The trailer is hilarious, but there is a game coming out called Strong Bad's Cool Game for

31:45.400 --> 31:47.800
Attractive People.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.800
Which is, yeah.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.640
Aw, I'm sorry, Loki, you can't play.

31:51.640 --> 31:53.600
That's alright.

31:53.600 --> 32:03.080
Or if you're, you know, super cool, as the trailer says, it's SBCG for AP.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
So yeah.

32:04.080 --> 32:09.160
But anyway, it's gonna be episodic games, gonna be out starting in June.

32:09.160 --> 32:15.880
Being put out by Telltale Games, and it's five episode season, and it will be out once

32:15.880 --> 32:16.880
a month.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.920
And they're the ones that did the Sam and Max games.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.160
Are they?

32:21.160 --> 32:22.160
Interesting.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.840
Speaking of which, that's Sam and Max for the Wii, that's season one.

32:25.840 --> 32:26.840
Only.

32:26.840 --> 32:27.840
Only season one.

32:27.840 --> 32:28.840
Oh, thank you for the update.

32:28.840 --> 32:29.840
Appreciate it.

32:29.840 --> 32:34.200
But it should be reasonable.

32:34.200 --> 32:38.920
Well there's gonna be a, the trailer is actually posted in our chat room right now, chat.orangelaunchvideo.com

32:38.920 --> 32:41.840
from Tigerclaw, found it on YouTube and dug that up.

32:41.840 --> 32:44.920
Going back to the last story, because there was a lot of comments from the voice chat

32:44.920 --> 32:49.320
on Final Fantasy IV, going back to some comments from our chat room.

32:49.320 --> 32:53.560
Let's see, Jonathan F. is fantasizing Final Fantasy VI with voices, because you would

32:53.560 --> 32:55.940
have the opera scene with singing.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.640
Celeste would actually sing the opera.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.600
That could be, that could be, go either way.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.640
That could be really good or really bad.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.400
Well like, they could do it like, Dear Friends.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.000
If they get real people to do it, yeah, well remember when we went to, it was More Friends,

33:07.000 --> 33:08.680
not Dear Friends, but More Friends.

33:08.680 --> 33:09.680
They did the opera live.

33:09.680 --> 33:10.680
And it, it wasn't bad.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.160
It was actually really good.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.560
FootyMonster is happy about the cutscenes.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.040
He says, voice cutscenes are awesome.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.840
I'm very happy about this.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.280
RawsteelUT, not so happy.

33:18.280 --> 33:19.840
He says, voices on the DS?

33:19.840 --> 33:22.040
That's gonna be massive compression.

33:22.040 --> 33:24.080
But he says, ooh, Dragon Quest IV.

33:24.080 --> 33:28.400
ShadowSlayer thinks it could be good if they get good voice actors.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.480
Odd1 says, it's dependent on how big the card for the game is.

33:32.480 --> 33:36.560
And Zeppelin says, why can't they put one to two gigabyte in a DS card?

33:36.560 --> 33:37.920
I'm pretty sure they can, can't they?

33:37.920 --> 33:38.920
I think they can.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.920
Yeah, why not?

33:39.920 --> 33:43.960
If your camera can fit like two gigabytes, I'm sure those DS cards can crank in like

33:43.960 --> 33:45.360
four gigabytes on those cards.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.760
You'd probably get some pretty massive games on there.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.760
So.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.760
Yeah.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.760
So this is another rumor.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.840
Oh, I'm sorry, was there more on the Strong Bad stuff?

33:52.840 --> 33:54.400
I had more to say.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
Oh, sure, sure.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.400
But that's okay.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.640
Well, there's nobody in chat commenting on it either.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.240
What do you guys think of the Strong Bad game?

34:00.240 --> 34:04.040
Oh, BlackWolf says the Strong Bad game is also coming to the PC.

34:04.040 --> 34:07.080
So if you don't want to download that on the Wii, you can also get it on the PC.

34:07.080 --> 34:14.120
Well, I was going to say the type of game is a 3D point, to actually quote a quote from

34:14.120 --> 34:19.880
Strong Bad, okay, it is a puffy 3D point-and-click-em-up adventure.

34:19.880 --> 34:22.680
You need to do it in the Strong Bad voice.

34:22.680 --> 34:23.680
No.

34:23.680 --> 34:26.560
Dan can do the Strong Bad voice.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.400
I cannot.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.560
You can turn the light switch on or off.

34:32.560 --> 34:33.560
That's all I remember.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.560
All right.

34:34.560 --> 34:38.760
I did not install it so you could have a light switch rave.

34:38.760 --> 34:40.000
What do you think?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Winner or sellout?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
Winner!

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
Winner?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
I hope so.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.000
It all depends on the game.

34:45.000 --> 34:50.580
But that's hopeful if it's the same folks that did Sam and Max, so we'll see.

34:50.580 --> 34:56.280
Another game that hopefully will be coming soon, Elibits 2.

34:56.280 --> 35:02.160
And of course, this is coming from the latest issue of the official Nintendo magazine, reporting

35:02.160 --> 35:08.200
that Elibits 2 will be due out on the Wii later this year, which is odd because I thought

35:08.200 --> 35:11.400
it was supposed to be due out on the DS later this year.

35:11.400 --> 35:18.520
Either way, it'll be coming to a Nintendo system this year probably, and hopefully won't

35:18.520 --> 35:22.800
be just mediocre like the last game.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.000
I kind of like the last game with the level designs and stuff like that.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.040
The last game was kind of neat, but there was something about it that didn't keep me

35:30.040 --> 35:31.480
there long-term, you know what I mean?

35:31.480 --> 35:36.080
I don't know if I just felt like there wasn't a lot to keep me going in that game, you know

35:36.080 --> 35:37.080
what I mean?

35:37.080 --> 35:39.520
Which is odd to say because there was the level editor and those things like that, but

35:39.520 --> 35:40.520
I don't know.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.920
It just kind of seemed like the game got kind of old.

35:41.920 --> 35:46.160
The formula to the game got a little bit old to me, so hopefully they'll have some.

35:46.160 --> 35:50.020
I mean, but think about how far the Wii has progressed since Elibits was...

35:50.020 --> 35:53.200
It wasn't in the launch, but it was right after, right?

35:53.200 --> 35:54.720
Didn't Elibits come out right after launch?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.600
It was one of the first major games to come out after launch.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.720
Now they have a lot more they can play with.

35:59.720 --> 36:04.200
I'm sure technologies have come along and developed in the Wii games as well as online

36:04.200 --> 36:05.200
possibly, which could be interesting.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.400
I don't know what they could do with a DS version of the game, because a lot of that

36:08.400 --> 36:14.480
game required you to be able to pull on the remote and twist it and stuff like that.

36:14.480 --> 36:22.680
It'd be hard not to have that depth sensing that the Wii version had in the DS version.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.960
Some comments from chat on Elibits, Sephiroth1215 not happy from this.

36:25.960 --> 36:32.020
Ah no, I hate Elibits, and RawsteelUT says, it's Elibits, no one cares.

36:32.020 --> 36:35.520
Frisbee wants to mention that it was a launch title in Japan.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.440
Qualtippo says, Elibits seemed good at the time, but no staying power though.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.800
And Gerardimo says, Elibits was good and innovative, just shallow.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.080
That might actually be a good way of phrasing it.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.080
But I don't know.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.920
I mean, you really want to appreciate Elibits, but I don't know, it just kind of got old

36:49.920 --> 36:50.920
quick.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.160
Chat.orangelaunchradio.com if you want to join in the fun here on this Sunday night.

36:54.160 --> 36:57.000
Remember we are on a new network, allgames.com.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.360
At this time we're not, it's just too much to read the All Games chat and the Orange

37:00.360 --> 37:04.760
Lounge chat and we have people chatting on Justin.TV as well who thinks I'm neglecting

37:04.760 --> 37:05.880
them over on Justin.TV.

37:05.880 --> 37:11.080
I'm not, it's just a lot to read and try to do a show at the same time and bring you more

37:11.080 --> 37:16.360
gaming news like this one about the white GameCube controller.

37:16.360 --> 37:21.140
That's right, there is a white GameCube controller coming out a little later this year if you

37:21.140 --> 37:22.680
live in Japan.

37:22.680 --> 37:23.680
That's the problem.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.540
It's only going to come out for those of you guys in Japan.

37:26.540 --> 37:31.080
It's a little weird though that this is just now coming out.

37:31.080 --> 37:34.420
It's a white GameCube controller to match the Wii basically.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.600
It is the same color as the Nintendo Wii.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.240
And it's coming out for the games that will support the GameCube controller such as Super

37:41.240 --> 37:45.880
Smash Brothers and now Mario Kart Wii we know is going to support the GameCube controller.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.840
So there's a, this is going to be coming out in Japan.

37:48.840 --> 37:53.820
But the odd thing is, why not a Wavebird controller that would make so much more sense because

37:53.820 --> 37:55.820
the Wavebird was pretty awesome.

37:55.820 --> 37:58.800
I don't know if it's a cost thing or what.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.100
But who knows if this will be coming out here.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.880
It's actually a lot sooner than later this year.

38:02.880 --> 38:07.800
That is coming out later this month according to Nintendo of Japan's website.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.880
So pretty cool.

38:09.880 --> 38:13.840
I don't know, do you think they ought to bring Wavebirds, white Wavebirds to the Wii?

38:13.840 --> 38:16.760
Or does it matter because if you didn't buy one-

38:16.760 --> 38:18.840
There are Wavebirds?

38:18.840 --> 38:20.680
Because there already are Wavebirds and if you weren't-

38:20.680 --> 38:22.000
But they don't make them anymore.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
So?

38:23.000 --> 38:27.680
So you're basically saying screw you to everyone who didn't get one like me.

38:27.680 --> 38:28.680
I can bring them over.

38:28.680 --> 38:29.680
You suck.

38:29.680 --> 38:33.660
But honestly, and I'll tell you this, remember when they came out with those different colored

38:33.660 --> 38:37.480
controllers for the GameCube?

38:37.480 --> 38:44.200
Well GameStop and a few other retailers were getting shipments of them.

38:44.200 --> 38:49.520
They were even selling the spice color, the orange one basically, that we didn't technically

38:49.520 --> 38:51.200
get a release of over here.

38:51.200 --> 38:56.360
So I actually wouldn't be too surprised to see it at GameStop, GameCrazy, any of your

38:56.360 --> 38:59.160
actual retailers.

38:59.160 --> 39:05.260
And they actually get hori items too, to sell.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.600
You sometimes see these little random import things too at random stores.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.600
Just kind of have to look around.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.600
You know what I mean?

39:10.600 --> 39:20.160
So our oddest find as far as import anything went at actual GameStop was buying Capcom

39:20.160 --> 39:27.480
Classic Collection Volume 2, which was the Ghosts and Goblins, the Makaimura, Daimakaimura.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.600
But it never came out here, right?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.520
No, we never got that collection.

39:30.520 --> 39:38.320
We got the Japanese one at a GameStop in Hilltop Mall.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.800
Several people in chat, by the way, mentioning that the Wavebirds did not have rumble.

39:41.800 --> 39:45.240
Perhaps that's the reason Nintendo is deciding not to do it.

39:45.240 --> 39:49.780
Because Sony learned the hard way, you gotta have rumble.

39:49.780 --> 39:54.960
Rumble is not so last gen, as they tried to say at E3 a couple years ago.

39:54.960 --> 39:55.960
They learned the hard way.

39:55.960 --> 39:56.960
So maybe that's why.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.760
But why, I mean, is a Wavebird with rumble that hard to do?

40:00.760 --> 40:02.120
I mean is it?

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
I don't know.

40:03.120 --> 40:04.120
Maybe it's just me.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.120
It's impossible.

40:05.120 --> 40:09.480
If the Xbox 360 wireless can do rumble, I would think.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.920
Maybe it's just me.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.200
It's not that hard.

40:13.200 --> 40:14.200
I didn't think so.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.560
I mean, I'm not even, no, no, no, no, no.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
Alright, moving on.

40:18.560 --> 40:24.520
I can't fathom why they think it'd be difficult, but anyway, for our Squenix fans out there,

40:24.520 --> 40:29.760
and actually for anyone who is a fan of the manga series Soul Eater, there is going to

40:29.760 --> 40:35.200
be a Soul Eater RPG out on the Wii, put out by Squenix.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.080
And if you don't know anything about Soul Eater, there's a Wikipedia article, so enjoy.

40:39.080 --> 40:46.800
But it will be coming to the US, and actually, my apologies, it's so far listed as Japan

40:46.800 --> 40:49.960
only and I don't think it's going to be coming out anywhere else.

40:49.960 --> 40:50.960
So.

40:50.960 --> 40:55.840
I mean, because honestly, it has, I don't even think the Soul Eater manga's come out

40:55.840 --> 40:58.400
over in the US, has it?

40:58.400 --> 41:00.440
You're asking the wrong guy when it comes to manga.

41:00.440 --> 41:08.440
The whole point of the, I guess, manga is that these people are going to this technical

41:08.440 --> 41:14.640
school to make weapons and have to make this one weapon out of 99 evil human souls and

41:14.640 --> 41:17.400
one belonging to this witch to make a death scythe.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.760
Which I think death scythe, and I think back to Gundam Wing, so whatever.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.600
Well the way you describe it, it sounds kind of cool.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.200
Yeah, it would be something I would read.

41:24.200 --> 41:26.200
But I don't know if that's something that would come out here.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.200
No.

41:27.200 --> 41:32.120
I mean, I don't know if, I'll read the manga I guess.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.300
Well I guess it's nice to see Squeenix doing something that's, you know, outside of their

41:35.300 --> 41:37.640
usual IPs, if nothing else, right?

41:37.640 --> 41:38.640
Yeah.

41:38.640 --> 41:43.040
I mean, how many actual manga adaptations in game have they really done?

41:43.040 --> 41:44.040
I can't think of a lot.

41:44.040 --> 41:47.840
But they've had their stuff done as manga.

41:47.840 --> 41:54.400
It's better than continuing to bastardize the Blank of Mana series.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.160
I almost bought that game on DS.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.960
I'll never forgive them for that PlayStation 1.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.960
What was PlayStation 1?

41:59.960 --> 42:00.960
Was that Legend of Mana?

42:00.960 --> 42:01.960
Legend of Mana.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.960
Oh my god, I hated that game.

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
You know what my problem with Legend of Mana was?

42:03.960 --> 42:04.960
I hated that game.

42:04.960 --> 42:05.960
What?

42:05.960 --> 42:08.240
Is I imported it like a dumbass.

42:08.240 --> 42:16.000
And that was the most text-intensive, kanji-heavy game I have ever freaking played.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.160
And I could read like five words on an entire page.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.400
You know what other Squeenix collection I can't stand, and they've done more than one

42:23.400 --> 42:24.400
games in the series.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.920
I can't even remember the name of it.

42:25.920 --> 42:28.920
It's the one where there's like eight different people, and they have the eight-

42:28.920 --> 42:29.920
Saga Frontier.

42:29.920 --> 42:30.920
The Saga series.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
I freaking hate the Saga series.

42:32.920 --> 42:33.920
Cannot stand it.

42:33.920 --> 42:39.720
Sorry, RPG fans and Saga fans, but if you thought that, you know, because I do give

42:39.720 --> 42:43.560
Final Fantasy a lot of love here on the show, Chrono series, things like that, but if you

42:43.560 --> 42:47.720
thought the Squeenix could do no wrong, just go play the Saga series sometime.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.720
It's pretty bad.

42:48.720 --> 42:49.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.840
Why didn't they ever carry on like the Tow Ball series?

42:51.840 --> 42:52.840
I like that one.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.840
Hmm.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.840
What about Alundra?

42:54.840 --> 42:57.840
Or Brave Fencer Musache was them, wasn't it?

42:57.840 --> 42:58.840
Yeah, they did a new one.

42:58.840 --> 42:59.840
Those were cute.

42:59.840 --> 43:00.840
Yeah, did they?

43:00.840 --> 43:01.840
It was a cute one.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.320
I like PlayStation 2.

43:04.320 --> 43:12.000
So this is also another article kind of correcting some more wrongs with Mario Kart Wii.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.960
Apparently there was news before that Mario Kart Wii did not work with the freeloader.

43:16.960 --> 43:18.960
However, that is false.

43:18.960 --> 43:24.000
It actually does work just fine with the freeloader, so if you happen to live in the US and want

43:24.000 --> 43:30.080
to pick up a copy of the European version and get it a few weeks before we get it here,

43:30.080 --> 43:34.720
then go right ahead and pick one up because the freeloader will work just fine.

43:34.720 --> 43:44.240
In fact, Import Retailer NCS tested the game on a version 3.1 firmware and it ran just

43:44.240 --> 43:50.160
fine and apparently there was some issues, I guess, with 3.0 firmware.

43:50.160 --> 43:54.600
So if you update your firmware, it should be good to go.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.880
But I don't know.

43:56.880 --> 43:57.880
Great game.

43:57.880 --> 43:58.880
Wow.

43:58.880 --> 44:03.880
Didn't take long for that to get opened up there.

44:03.880 --> 44:07.960
But I guess, you know, especially with these staggered international dates, there really

44:07.960 --> 44:10.400
are people who just can't freaking wait.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
Like you.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
Threw away the steering wheel.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
Piece of shit.

44:13.400 --> 44:18.600
Would it be cheaper, maybe, to import it so you can get the version without the steering

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
wheel?

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
I don't know.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.240
I don't think they sell it without the steering wheel.

44:23.240 --> 44:29.360
Well, apparently, on Mario Kart Wii, there are already people cheating in there.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.400
And it's in the time trials mode, apparently.

44:31.400 --> 44:35.840
There's all these impossible times that are showing up in the time trials mode.

44:35.840 --> 44:40.680
Apparently, somebody on the official Nintendo Magazine forums wrote this on here.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.760
I only saw it on the snowboard track.

44:42.760 --> 44:45.920
There was a guy with a time of 53 point something or other seconds.

44:45.920 --> 44:49.160
There are about three other people with exactly the same time.

44:49.160 --> 44:53.360
Like others have said, on the replay, the guy just does one lap really slow and then

44:53.360 --> 44:56.320
turns the opposite way just after the finish line.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.460
Then the replay doesn't stop.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.840
So he says, personally, I think it's a bug.

45:00.840 --> 45:02.440
I've only seen it on one track.

45:02.440 --> 45:04.280
And there are others with the same time.

45:04.280 --> 45:10.320
What apparently was happening, and I'm not positive this is actually the case, but what

45:10.320 --> 45:18.840
I heard was that if you let the time trial sit there for longer than 99 minutes and 99

45:18.840 --> 45:23.560
seconds and 0.99, it'll actually loop back around to zero again.

45:23.560 --> 45:28.440
So people were racing through a couple laps or whatever.

45:28.440 --> 45:36.120
And then they would stop, wait for it to just barely flip over from, you know, who has time

45:36.120 --> 45:37.120
to do that?

45:37.120 --> 45:40.880
I mean, really, you're going to sit there and wait for 99 minutes or even, you know,

45:40.880 --> 45:42.400
just leaving it on, doing that.

45:42.400 --> 45:47.160
I don't know what the hell you're doing, you know, going up, going out drinking or something

45:47.160 --> 45:54.760
and coming back 90 minutes later, just to have a high score that we all know is a piece

45:54.760 --> 45:55.760
of crap.

45:55.760 --> 45:59.720
Well, the thing about that, too, though, Nintendo has actually removed those scores off of their

45:59.720 --> 46:03.000
leaderboards now.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
So Nintendo is cracking down.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.920
I'm just waiting for it to happen where people find a way to cheat in the multiplayer mode.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
You know what I mean?

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
That's going to be a...

46:09.920 --> 46:11.800
Oh my God.

46:11.800 --> 46:15.960
I hope Nintendo knows a way to patch this game on the fly if things like that happen,

46:15.960 --> 46:17.840
but we'll see.

46:17.840 --> 46:22.240
I don't know, I don't think they have it built in yet where they can patch games.

46:22.240 --> 46:27.120
In fact, I know they don't have it built in yet where they can patch games.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.440
Does their firmware updates patch the games?

46:29.440 --> 46:33.240
There's firmware updates, but I don't think they patch games.

46:33.240 --> 46:37.400
But the good thing, though, is they don't have an action replay yet for the Wii.

46:37.400 --> 46:42.680
They only have game saves and power saves and stuff like that.

46:42.680 --> 46:43.680
I don't know.

46:43.680 --> 46:48.800
There shouldn't really be a way to cheat unless you do something with the servers or whatever

46:48.800 --> 46:51.360
where you lag someone out.

46:51.360 --> 46:55.080
Plus it just goes back to if you're cheating online, why?

46:55.080 --> 46:56.080
Why really?

46:56.080 --> 46:57.080
What do you got to prove?

46:57.080 --> 46:58.080
I don't know.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.080
You know what I mean?

46:59.080 --> 47:04.520
You beat three other strangers in an online Mario match when Nintendo doesn't even tell

47:04.520 --> 47:05.520
you who you're playing against.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.920
I mean, it's kind of like, big wow.

47:07.920 --> 47:08.920
You know?

47:08.920 --> 47:10.840
It's like, do you really have to feel that special?

47:10.840 --> 47:12.000
I don't know.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.440
Maybe it's just me.

47:13.440 --> 47:20.040
Well, speaking of special people, you know that there's always that time top 100 most

47:20.040 --> 47:22.760
influential people that they do.

47:22.760 --> 47:24.920
And guess who's on the list this year?

47:24.920 --> 47:25.920
Miyamoto.

47:25.920 --> 47:28.600
He is on the list this year.

47:28.600 --> 47:36.880
He has been voted for 25,000 times as of the source I'm reading.

47:36.880 --> 47:41.440
So he's at number 31 out of 200.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.320
And 56%.

47:44.320 --> 47:49.480
And basically he's been put on there basically for making Mario and Zelda.

47:49.480 --> 47:55.940
And for the new Wii stuff, you know, the things he's trying to do with the Wii.

47:55.940 --> 48:00.400
And that, and he's been quoted saying that he wants to make people more aware of their

48:00.400 --> 48:06.520
bodies and get in better shape and use that as a tool to improve their life and not just

48:06.520 --> 48:08.160
slack around, you know?

48:08.160 --> 48:11.360
So how much influence does the online poll have in the final result?

48:11.360 --> 48:14.920
I mean, I seem to recall in the past, Time kind of did their own list of the 100 most

48:14.920 --> 48:19.020
influential people, but then like the online poll kind of ran separately.

48:19.020 --> 48:23.120
And you know, so you'd see like Howard Stern and Miyamoto and all these, you know, people

48:23.120 --> 48:26.200
that have rabid fan bases, you know, towards the top of the list.

48:26.200 --> 48:31.160
Well, see that I'm really not sure exactly how it works, but I can tell you other people

48:31.160 --> 48:32.160
who are on it.

48:32.160 --> 48:33.800
You've heard of Rain, haven't you?

48:33.800 --> 48:34.800
I think so.

48:34.800 --> 48:35.800
Korean.

48:35.800 --> 48:36.800
Oh yeah.

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
Yeah.

48:37.800 --> 48:38.800
He's actually right up at the top.

48:38.800 --> 48:39.800
Interesting.

48:39.800 --> 48:41.680
And right behind him is Steven Colbert.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.720
See it's people with rabid fan bases like that.

48:44.720 --> 48:48.600
Nothing against Steven Colbert because I think he's hilarious, but you know what I mean?

48:48.600 --> 48:51.160
Well, he does have Captain America shield.

48:51.160 --> 48:56.200
Hey, some comments from Justin TV, actually, who says, I ignore them all the time, but

48:56.200 --> 48:59.080
a good comment here about the whole patching of Wii games.

48:59.080 --> 49:03.120
Richie Maniac says they can't patch, otherwise they would have fixed Guitar Hero 3 without

49:03.120 --> 49:04.880
sending out new discs.

49:04.880 --> 49:05.880
Very good point.

49:05.880 --> 49:09.120
So if somebody's cheating in Mario Kart, there's nothing they can do about it.

49:09.120 --> 49:12.240
Well, I'm putting the unlink to vote for Miyamoto in the chat room.

49:12.240 --> 49:17.680
But you could cheat however you want, however much you want in the...

49:17.680 --> 49:19.920
And Black Wolf says, is correcting me and saying it's Colbert.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.680
I thought that was just something he did on the show.

49:21.680 --> 49:22.680
Is his last name really Colbert?

49:22.680 --> 49:24.240
I thought that was just the show joke.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.240
Colbert.

49:25.240 --> 49:26.240
Because it's weird.

49:26.240 --> 49:29.240
I know people with the exact same last name in real life, but they pronounce it with the

49:29.240 --> 49:31.320
hard T. So my bad.

49:31.320 --> 49:33.800
That's why it's the Colbert Report because, you know.

49:33.800 --> 49:34.800
Oh.

49:34.800 --> 49:35.800
Well, I just thought that was a joke.

49:35.800 --> 49:40.160
I just got corrected again, so people don't correct me, okay?

49:40.160 --> 49:41.160
This is pissing me off.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.660
It's hot in here.

49:42.660 --> 49:43.660
It is hot in here today.

49:43.660 --> 49:46.040
What is up with the weather?

49:46.040 --> 49:52.480
There's another game that got announced this week during Nintendo's Media Summit.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.480
And this is not really a big surprise at all.

49:54.480 --> 49:59.800
In fact, I want to say we've already seen this being announced at E3 last year, but

49:59.800 --> 50:01.800
whatever.

50:01.800 --> 50:08.240
Anyways, it is Super Mario, or I should say Mario Super Sluggers.

50:08.240 --> 50:17.140
And it is, of course, a continuation of Super Mario Stadium Baseball.

50:17.140 --> 50:25.160
Just another sports game from Nintendo that's capitalizing on Mario, just like Mario Strikers

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
and stuff.

50:26.160 --> 50:28.480
You know, it's kind of funny.

50:28.480 --> 50:31.320
I hope they don't do this, but I could just see them because they're kind of following

50:31.320 --> 50:36.840
the trends of, or I should say bad trends, that third party companies are creating accessories

50:36.840 --> 50:37.840
for.

50:37.840 --> 50:40.000
They're creating attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.800
I could just see them releasing this game with a baseball bat attachment or something

50:43.800 --> 50:44.800
for the Wii.

50:44.800 --> 50:47.560
Just like, I don't know, try to sell a few more copies.

50:47.560 --> 50:48.560
Here's my question.

50:48.560 --> 50:51.800
What really is the difference between the Super Sluggers thing and the Strikers?

50:51.800 --> 50:54.040
I mean, aren't they just kind of both baseball games?

50:54.040 --> 50:57.160
No, Strikers is a soccer game, whereas Sluggers is a baseball game.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.160
Oh, what the hell am I thinking?

50:58.160 --> 50:59.160
Why am I...

50:59.160 --> 51:00.160
But there's another...

51:00.160 --> 51:01.160
Wasn't there another...

51:01.160 --> 51:02.160
Yeah, there's Mario Baseball.

51:02.160 --> 51:05.400
Yeah, I'm like, I know there's another baseball game that already freaking came out on the

51:05.400 --> 51:06.400
Wii.

51:06.400 --> 51:07.400
Really?

51:07.400 --> 51:10.680
I could have sworn there was already a baseball game on the Wii.

51:10.680 --> 51:15.840
No, just like how there was, was it, oh god, I don't remember what the other...

51:15.840 --> 51:19.200
There was another soccer game that was on GameCube as well.

51:19.200 --> 51:23.840
So it's just import whatever, you know, sport with Mario in it.

51:23.840 --> 51:24.840
Yeah.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.680
Pretty soon it'll be Mario synchronized swimming.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.680
Just in time for the Beijing Olympics.

51:28.680 --> 51:31.840
I don't see how there could be any popular Japanese franchise that won't have a baseball

51:31.840 --> 51:32.840
game attached to it.

51:32.840 --> 51:34.280
I guess that's true.

51:34.280 --> 51:35.880
Baseball is like the sport.

51:35.880 --> 51:36.920
I guess that's true.

51:36.920 --> 51:42.360
And guess what, Rob, you'll be happy to know that Toadette is in this game as well.

51:42.360 --> 51:43.360
Bitch.

51:43.360 --> 51:48.500
All right, rostielut in chat, dot orange launcher dot com, says, oh, baseball on the Wii.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.200
This will appeal to the fanboys, really.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.840
The casuals still have Wii Sports.

51:51.840 --> 51:55.560
Well, I would think that baseball fanboys would go for something a little more hardcore.

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
MLB 2K8.

51:56.560 --> 51:58.560
And I don't know if it would necessarily be on the Wii.

51:58.560 --> 52:02.160
Or MLB Power Pros, you know, where it was just another baseball game.

52:02.160 --> 52:04.760
Or they've already got like plenty of baseball games on them.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.840
I would think these are the people that do like baseball on Wii Sports but want to take

52:07.840 --> 52:08.840
it like one step further.

52:08.840 --> 52:09.840
You know what I mean?

52:09.840 --> 52:10.840
I don't know.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.160
I don't know how appealing that is.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.720
But Jamie does have a good point, especially over in Japan.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.720
Baseball is huge.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.480
And you know, baseball is huge here, too.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.880
It may not be as big as football in this day and age, but.

52:20.880 --> 52:21.880
That's fine.

52:21.880 --> 52:23.960
This game will come out in the E3 or whatever.

52:23.960 --> 52:28.280
I have a feeling, because I heard some rumors before, that this was going to be coming out

52:28.280 --> 52:29.280
in June.

52:29.280 --> 52:35.800
And then in July, there was supposed to be that stupid disaster day of crisis.

52:35.800 --> 52:38.960
I don't remember what blog I read that in, but.

52:38.960 --> 52:42.480
If this does come out and stuff, and then E3 rolls around and, oh, guess what?

52:42.480 --> 52:43.480
Wii Sports 2.

52:43.480 --> 52:44.680
And it's like, ah, shit.

52:44.680 --> 52:48.120
I just bought this game and now, you know, Wii Sports 2.

52:48.120 --> 52:53.200
Which is going to be probably the number one selling game all time on Wii.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.200
Mario Hockey.

52:54.200 --> 52:55.720
Several people want to see that game in our chat room.

52:55.720 --> 52:56.960
A Mario Hockey game.

52:56.960 --> 53:00.440
I don't know, though, because I think Nintendo might have a problem with people punching

53:00.440 --> 53:01.440
Mario in the face.

53:01.440 --> 53:07.460
Mario Hockey, all that would be is just like Super Mario Strikers with re-skinned, basically.

53:07.460 --> 53:08.460
You know what they need?

53:08.460 --> 53:10.840
They need to bring back old school ice hockey.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.360
I actually had this game on the NES.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.680
I'm not talking Blades of Steel, although that game was frickin rad, too, but I'm talking

53:15.680 --> 53:16.880
old school ice hockey.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.040
Remember this game?

53:18.040 --> 53:23.120
Where you had your entire team consisted of the fat guys, the skinny guys, and the average

53:23.120 --> 53:24.120
guys.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.120
Remember that?

53:25.120 --> 53:26.120
Yeah.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
Mario Hockey 2008.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.120
Or Ice Hockey Wii.

53:28.120 --> 53:31.520
That'd be rad.

53:31.520 --> 53:32.520
You know you want it.

53:32.520 --> 53:37.160
All right, let's travel the world and explore upcoming release dates.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.640
We're going to check out some games that are coming out a little bit sooner than some of

53:39.640 --> 53:41.340
these other games we've been talking about.

53:41.340 --> 53:45.140
We will start off in Japan on the Xbox 360 this week.

53:45.140 --> 53:46.200
Really not a lot.

53:46.200 --> 53:49.800
You really have to wait for the 24th for any big games to start coming out.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.380
Same thing with the PlayStation 3.

53:51.380 --> 53:53.480
It's kind of a slow period right now.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.320
On the Nintendo Wii, nothing either.

53:56.320 --> 54:00.280
This is a dry week in Japan for these next batch of systems.

54:00.280 --> 54:05.240
But if you want to go back to the PlayStation 2, Ape Escape 3 is coming out now in a Chinese

54:05.240 --> 54:06.240
language.

54:06.240 --> 54:10.240
So for the other Asian regions abroad, Ape Escape 3 comes out in Chinese this week.

54:10.240 --> 54:16.080
Also a game called Hoshigari Empusa comes out in Japan on April the 17th.

54:16.080 --> 54:23.760
And going over to the Nintendo DS, Gear Spirit from TV Animation One Piece, Gear Spirit.

54:23.760 --> 54:28.960
Also from Nintendo, Pack and Ball comes out on the Nintendo DS.

54:28.960 --> 54:34.480
And a new Phoenix Wright game, Gaikukten Saiban Mask Vision Murder Case.

54:34.480 --> 54:38.240
Actually, I'm sorry, that's just a price reduction on Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.

54:38.240 --> 54:41.340
I was going to say, isn't that already out?

54:41.340 --> 54:42.340
Just a price reduction.

54:42.340 --> 54:43.340
Now it's out for much cheaper.

54:43.340 --> 54:46.920
You can import that for about 20 bucks now, plus shipping.

54:46.920 --> 54:50.240
So that's not bad.

54:50.240 --> 54:59.720
Also on the Nintendo DS, Kansu Hajime Yo Shisan Unyo DS comes out.

54:59.720 --> 55:04.280
And this is just, I don't know, the cover has a bunch of people like planting trees

55:04.280 --> 55:05.320
on it.

55:05.320 --> 55:09.160
And I don't know if that's supposed to symbolize like a tree of knowledge or what that is.

55:09.160 --> 55:14.840
Because the category for the game is miscellaneous, which usually means some type of boring training

55:14.840 --> 55:15.840
type thing.

55:15.840 --> 55:16.840
I don't think it's a dating sim.

55:16.840 --> 55:17.840
Joking.

55:17.840 --> 55:20.000
Because you actually use the touch screen and stuff.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.720
It's a perverted dating sim, though.

55:21.720 --> 55:22.880
No, not that kind of dating.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.760
It's not like, you know, I don't know.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.760
I'm joking, Rob.

55:26.760 --> 55:30.360
Let's see if there's anything coming out on the PSP.

55:30.360 --> 55:35.280
Although I somehow doubt it, but we'll take a look real quick for the PSP in Japan.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.280
No.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.560
But the 24th will be a big week.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.320
There's lots more stuff coming out for you folks in Japan on the 24th.

55:41.320 --> 55:46.840
But this week, you're gonna have to just play the games you already have, I guess.

55:46.840 --> 55:47.840
That's it.

55:47.840 --> 55:55.320
For the games that are coming out for our friends over in the UK, we have, on the 16th,

55:55.320 --> 55:59.560
Trackmania Nations Forever on PC.

55:59.560 --> 56:00.560
Trackmania.

56:00.560 --> 56:03.960
Those look pretty awesome.

56:03.960 --> 56:04.960
Is it?

56:04.960 --> 56:05.960
Yeah.

56:05.960 --> 56:06.960
Okay.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.840
I want that Konami track game where you can play as Pyramid Head.

56:09.840 --> 56:10.840
That's the one I'm waiting for.

56:10.840 --> 56:11.840
I know, right?

56:11.840 --> 56:12.840
The new track and field?

56:12.840 --> 56:13.840
Yeah.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.840
Do want.

56:14.840 --> 56:15.840
July.

56:15.840 --> 56:16.840
The hell with all the other track games.

56:16.840 --> 56:17.840
July or August.

56:17.840 --> 56:18.840
Alright, thank you.

56:18.840 --> 56:23.960
Anyway, also coming out, now this is on the 18th of this next series of games, which is

56:23.960 --> 56:28.960
the day before my birthday, Emergency Mayhem on Wii.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.960
Hard to be a god on PC.

56:30.960 --> 56:34.240
I think I'm gonna need to get that game, okay?

56:34.240 --> 56:35.480
Story of my life.

56:35.480 --> 56:39.040
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.

56:39.040 --> 56:47.360
UEFA Euro 2008 on PC, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3, and PS2, and PSP, and Wonderswan Color,

56:47.360 --> 56:51.240
and Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Neo Geo CD.

56:51.240 --> 56:53.480
Those last four are probably not true.

56:53.480 --> 56:56.680
8 Ball All Stars on DS.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.640
We have Namco Museum Remix on Wii.

56:59.640 --> 57:01.320
I need to get that.

57:01.320 --> 57:04.280
The World Ends With You on DS.

57:04.280 --> 57:06.000
That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.120
That sounds like something you'd say before you kill someone.

57:08.120 --> 57:09.120
The World Ends With You.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.080
No, that sounds like a Bond movie.

57:11.080 --> 57:12.080
Ooh, it does.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.520
It does sound like a Bond movie.

57:14.520 --> 57:18.560
And the very last is Time Crisis 4 on Playstation 3.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.560
Awesome.

57:19.560 --> 57:22.720
Yeah, Time Crisis.

57:22.720 --> 57:28.760
In the US, it's an okay release week, I should say.

57:28.760 --> 57:37.480
Starting off, we've got Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All Stars for the DS.

57:37.480 --> 57:41.400
It's kind of an arcade-style version of that game.

57:41.400 --> 57:44.880
Sherlock Holmes Nemesis on the PC.

57:44.880 --> 57:49.280
AMF Bullying Pin Busters on the DS.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.760
Rondo of Swords on the DS.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.880
Good Atlus RPG.

57:53.880 --> 57:56.560
Okami on the Wii.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.640
Jack Keane on the PC.

57:59.640 --> 58:03.760
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue on the PS3.

58:03.760 --> 58:06.560
That's just a small little game there.

58:06.560 --> 58:09.960
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.

58:09.960 --> 58:15.600
Also on PC this week, Turok and Europa Universal...

58:15.600 --> 58:18.880
Was it Universalist Rome?

58:18.880 --> 58:21.400
That's kind of a weird name.

58:21.400 --> 58:24.480
High School Musical 2 worked this out on the DS.

58:24.480 --> 58:26.120
Also another Disney DS game.

58:26.120 --> 58:28.360
What if I don't want to work it out?

58:28.360 --> 58:29.360
Then you don't buy the game.

58:29.360 --> 58:30.680
Alright, I won't.

58:30.680 --> 58:35.040
Another Disney DS game, Cory in the House.

58:35.040 --> 58:40.640
The Sims 2 Kitchen and Bath Interior Design Stuff expansion for the PC.

58:40.640 --> 58:42.680
Oh, yay!

58:42.680 --> 58:49.240
Summer Sports Paradise Island for the Wii, also being brought out by Destineer, which

58:49.240 --> 58:51.520
has crappy games.

58:51.520 --> 58:56.600
Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingies for the DS.

58:56.600 --> 59:01.520
Emergency Mayhem for the Wii, which is supposed to be just like Crazy Taxi.

59:01.520 --> 59:09.560
And as Rob mentioned earlier, the Final Fantasy XI Vanity of Collection 2008 for the PC.

59:09.560 --> 59:10.920
We have other releases.

59:10.920 --> 59:13.040
Do you want to get into that kind of crack?

59:13.040 --> 59:14.040
Alright, yeah.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.880
What about the Virtual Console?

59:15.880 --> 59:18.240
Well these of course have already come out now.

59:18.240 --> 59:20.800
These are for our UK releases for Virtual Console.

59:20.800 --> 59:28.920
It's Yoshi's Cookie, which is 500 Wii points, the equivalent of 5 euro or 3 pounds 50.

59:28.920 --> 59:31.120
And it's Yoshi's Cookie.

59:31.120 --> 59:32.920
What more do I need to say about freaking Yoshi's Cookie?

59:32.920 --> 59:36.960
That it was far superior on the Super Nintendo, so why they released the Nintendo version

59:36.960 --> 59:37.960
I have no idea.

59:37.960 --> 59:40.040
Now the next one.

59:40.040 --> 59:43.080
We need triumphant music for this, for these next two.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.080
Hold on, hold on.

59:44.080 --> 59:46.640
I do have fanfare music somewhere.

59:46.640 --> 59:47.640
It'll just take me a minute.

59:47.640 --> 59:49.440
Can you read a different one before you get to those two?

59:49.440 --> 59:52.320
Well the next two are, these are the only two left.

59:52.320 --> 59:53.880
Actually, are they?

59:53.880 --> 59:55.080
No, there's more.

59:55.080 --> 59:57.160
I will skip ahead and then I will go back to the awesome ones.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.000
Alright good, because I'm getting the fanfare right now.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.160
California Games, which is Commodore 64.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.640
Ooh, Commodore 64 games are hitting the Wii finally.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.640
And Impossible Mission.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.480
Both of them.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.280
That's the one I should have played the fanfare for.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:19.320
Both of them are 500 Wii points, 3 pounds 50 pence or 5 euro.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:23.720
And um, but those aren't the two that- Stay awhile.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.720
The realm of awesome for me.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.720
Stay forever.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.800
Did you ever play Impossible Mission?

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.720
I didn't have a Commodore 64, Rob.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720
Really?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720
I told you I didn't.

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720
That's right.

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.080
You know what I had is I had the Texas Instruments stupid retardo computer.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.920
And I had a Coleco Adam.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.920
I'm still trying to find the sounds.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920
Darn it.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.360
Well then I will go ahead, because I will go ahead and announce the one that somebody

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.360
gets fanfare.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.360
Oh you know why?

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.560
Because here's the thing, I had to upgrade Winamp to get Shoutcast now.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.760
And for whatever reason my Winamp is not playing WAV files.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.080
Although you think it would.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.320
The old one did.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.280
I just haven't configured it right, so we have no sounds tonight.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.600
We'll have Loki sing a fanfare.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.680
Wait hold on, Loki sing the fanfare.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.560
I'm not singing the fanfare.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560
No fanfare.

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:09.560
Please.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:10.560
Use the NBC music.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.560
No.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.560
You can't use it can you?

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:13.560
Just read it.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.120
We're wasting so much time.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.120
Precious time.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:20.560
Alright, Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System, 500 Wii points.

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.520
And that game is really sweet, but this is the one that makes me super uber happy.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.520
Fantasy Zone!

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.680
Didn't we announce this last week?

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680
Yay.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.680
No.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.120
I think we announced it was coming, but it wasn't really known when it was coming.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120
It's out now.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.860
You're the Oppa Oppa and you get to shoot stuff and it sort of plays like Defender,

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.640
but it's awesome.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.480
Fantasy Zone is my second favorite game ever.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.480
And was one of the classic games of the week as well.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.680
It was the first classic game of the week.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.680
Alright.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680
Nice.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.160
By the way, in the US on the Virtual Console, you also get Yoshi's Cookie and Bases Loaded

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.240
came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.080
Speaking of baseball games, if you want to play one of the classics, Bases Loaded sets

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.160
you back 500 Wii points.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:08.640
Now we'll go back to some gaming news.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:14.160
And I don't know, this isn't exactly like totally gaming news, this is basically what

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.160
idiots think.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.060
I don't know, maybe this should be a new segment on our show.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.060
What idiots think.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.060
I don't know.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.700
Here's the deal.

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.460
There's this website and it's called WhatTheyPlay.com.

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:32.080
And it's a parental oriented website and they did a poll a little earlier this week.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.860
And what they did in this poll is that they surveyed what would you find most offensive

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.880
in a video game.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.560
And here's the results.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.900
The choices were a graphically severed human head, a man and a woman having sex, multiple

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.200
use of the F word, and two men kissing.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Here's the thing.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:59.280
The least offensive according to the poll is multiple usages of the F word, 10%.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:09.520
The second least offensive, a graphically severed human head with 28%, no 26%.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:15.300
And then two men kissing, 27%.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:21.320
So two men kissing is right in the same ballpark as a graphically severed human head in how

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.040
offensive they are in a video game.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.520
I mean like words escape me.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.160
I think most people in this generation that probably listen to this program are probably

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.240
rolling their eyes and going, what the fuck at this as well?

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.920
This is just a couple of like old farts that need to like get out of the barn and go outdoors

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920
once in a while.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920
They're answering this poll.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.000
And then they have a, was it the man and woman having sex?

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.120
Yeah, man and a woman having sex is at 37%, but honestly has no surprise to me.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.440
I mean, hello, look at American society.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.960
People are way more pent up over sexual things than they are violence.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.280
It's been that way forever.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:01.480
I have to say that we are probably one of the most, I'd have to say conflicting societies

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:07.600
as far as, because you know, sex sells everything and everything, you know, they're, you know,

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:08.960
the porn industry is thriving.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.560
There's all this yet we have this other extreme like, Oh, but we don't talk about that.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.720
Oh, we don't do this.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.960
Oh, we don't have this in our game.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.120
Oh, this is offensive.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.080
People just need to get over it.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.760
Sairan says in our chat room, well, what, so Sharon, I keep mispronouncing it says,

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.040
what did the two men look like?

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.560
I guess that is important because if they're like two guys who haven't bathed in a week,

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.600
that would be kind of offensive.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600
I think.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.960
I don't think the kissing would be offensive.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.840
I would just think that the lack of personal hygiene would be offensive.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.840
That's the point.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.480
So, so where does like, say, I don't know, a two men kissing graphically severed human

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:47.760
head, uh, on top of a man and woman having sex while they shout, you know, obscenities.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.120
Where's that fall on the list?

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.520
Is this your next dream game?

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.360
Is there, is there like, I think there, I think there is an OLR dream game to be had

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.360
here.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.520
Is there a write in, uh, uh, write in a vote?

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:01.520
There should be write in vote.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.520
All right.

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:03.520
Yeah.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.680
My write in vote would be this poll.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680
Here it is.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.680
Okay.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.840
We're going to call it a what they play.com the game.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840
Okay.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.560
It's what they play.com the game.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.280
And what it is is it, uh, it stars, uh, it stars three people, two guys and a girl.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.600
And uh, all they do is they know how to say the F word.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.400
So we get the 10% there.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:27.460
And uh, meanwhile the two guys will kiss and then the man and the woman will have sex while

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.160
they sever the other guy's head.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.160
I'm not sure.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:39.000
I'm not sure where the game is in this, but we'll find it somewhere to take pictures.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Yeah.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Yeah.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Like Pokemon.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Okay.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.200
There it is.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:54.160
So what the more offensive the photo is, the more D the photo is then that's beautiful.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:55.160
I love this idea.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.160
Sick imagination.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.160
It's what they play.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.160
Snap.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.160
Okay.

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.160
I want to change the name.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.160
The game.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160
Okay.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160
So an OLR dream game.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160
Here it is.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.160
What they play.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.160
Snap.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160
So it is to our Wiki.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.160
Yes.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.160
We need a dream games Wiki.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160
There is the dream games.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160
Yes.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.160
There's already a Wiki page on there, so we'll need to get this added.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:20.040
Uh, what they play snap and in what they play snap is three people that use the F word,

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:24.640
then half kiss each other, then have sex with each other, then kill each other while you

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.640
take pictures on a track.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:39.000
And then in later stages, in later stages, you get the pester ball because no one likes

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.480
the pester ball.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.040
We seriously have problems.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040
Rob is red in the face.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.440
I don't think it's from the heat.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.400
I think it's just so excited about the idea because I find this immature shit funny.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.400
Okay.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.600
Let's go back.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.400
Let's go back to the root problem though.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400
Here is this survey.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.960
Obviously we're being a little bit facetious with this whole stuff here.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.720
The problem is I want the game.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.480
I think quick poll.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.080
We need to do an insta poll right now in a orange lounge.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.080
Okay.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.080
Chat that orange laundry.com.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:12.060
I want to see some wiser ends.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:16.200
Would you buy what they play snap wire and would you play it?

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.520
Let's say the game costs $29.99.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.040
Would you put, would you buy it?

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.680
And it's on Nintendo Wii.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680
Would you buy it?

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680
Wire end.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.560
I think that that's what makes that the most, just completely farcical.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560
Act now.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:38.840
We'll throw in a, um, a severed head controller, like cover attachment, severed head attachment.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.280
It'd be a camera, severed head camera.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.360
Somebody in chat said something about this and I thought it was really good.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.280
Um, I think it was Ross Steele, UT had said something and I lost it here.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.280
Oh, here it is.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:53.200
Uh, seriously, this isn't exactly a scientific poll.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.680
You'd get different results on game facts and it does have to do with the audience that

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:01.980
was, uh, sampled is cause it was, you know, more of a conservative audience.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:06.000
But still, I mean, doesn't that kind of say something about just society in general?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.280
I mean, maybe this goes beyond gaming a little bit.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.160
Pardon us for getting so deep, but seriously guys, seriously, two guys kissing is more

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.680
offensive than a severed head.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.560
Like, I hate to break it to you, but like, you know, I don't think it's, I'm biased just

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.400
because I happen to be gay and you know, well, hell, the guy I'm seeing and have been seeing

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.680
for over a year now is a conservative.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.760
He's very active in Republican, he's a log cabin guy.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.080
He's very active in Republican politics.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.400
You know, whether you are conservative or liberal, doesn't really have anything to do

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.400
it.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:40.480
I don't know whether you're an idiot or not in terms of this poll, but I don't know.

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:44.920
Like I, me personally, I cannot watch the Saw movies like that level of violence.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.840
Like I watched the first one and I was like, that's enough.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.240
I've heard about what's in the other ones.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.720
I don't need to see it.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.760
If you want to watch it, have fun.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:54.040
You want to see that sick shit, go for it.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.320
But for me, like I don't want to watch that.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:58.120
There's other things I could watch with my time.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.120
Like showgirls.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.520
Showgirls is great and for the record, I've never seen a Saw movie and never will.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.040
Cause it's just, you know, I don't know.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.240
I think that is a generational thing.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.480
Am I going to change my opinion as I get older or what is it?

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480
No, no.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:22.320
I think that the violent graphic violence for the sake of graphic violence is unnecessary.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.320
You know, I believe in all things in moderation.

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.240
Like if I have a movie that's just a good movie that happens to have some graphic violence

01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:29.960
in it, then that's okay.

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.240
I don't care if there's a little blood and gore thrown out if it's part, you know, if

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.400
it moves the story along, but when the whole movie is nothing but that, then I think that

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.960
it's just crap.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.880
Here are the results of our quick poll.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.400
Would you buy our game on the Nintendo Wii?

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400
Why?

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400
Why?

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400
Why?

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.400
N. Throw the pester ball at the people having sex and they look up at you and say, fuck.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400
Why?

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.400
Why?

01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.400
Why?

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.400
Why?

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.400
Why?

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.400
Why?

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.400
Why?

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.400
Why?

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.400
Why?

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.400
Why?

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.400
Why?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.400
Why?

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.740
Why?

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:05.940
Why?

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:07.640
Why?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:09.080
Why in a fucking instant?

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080
And why?

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.040
There you have it.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.720
The results of the OLR quick poll.

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.320
Interesting comment as well from odd1.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.140
Torture porn is just what the name says.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.720
I'll leave it but nothing against those who watch it.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720
Why?

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.400
Because I don't bloody think that one piece of media is going to completely change a person

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.920
and destroy it whatever moral fiber they might have.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.160
And Jirnami says, case in point-

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.380
Each of the killer, you know, there's a lot of sick shit out there in movies

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:39.440
If you want to watch it go for it, but you know on the other hand if people want to watch

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:43.940
If people want to play a game that might involve a sexual component

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.920
Whatever right? That's what warnings are for. Hi exactly. It's what reviews are for. Hi read them, you know

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.620
Be educated be a little educated when it comes to purchasing your games be you know

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.940
What there's people should just be educated in general and not so freakin head up their ass

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.840
That's what I think all right your head out of your ass I

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.180
Don't really know what else to say in response to this story

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:14.760
I mean, you know, you think I'd have a big rant or something to say with this, but sadly the results

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.620
Don't kind of surprise me. It's just the way our society is I think

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.820
Think some of the people need to need to re-examine their priorities. I think this poll shows

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:28.060
I think that's the best way I can some of it this poll shows that there are people out there

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:35.720
With their certain agendas that really really need to re-examine their priorities. That's it back to games

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400
Okay Legos

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.600
Okay, Legos aren't really games, but they do make Lego games

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.840
And you know that I think that the Lego Star Wars games are tons of fun

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:53.760
so now there is going to be by Activision a Lego, Indiana Jones game that's going to be out on the 6th of June and

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.040
you have

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.600
you can actually play as over 60 characters and

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.200
Some of his friends and some of the enemies and you can actually

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.800
Customize your characters by mixing out their parts

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.520
you know like when you play with Legos and

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:18.240
And you have your whip and it's from what I'm seeing that that the whole using the whip is sort of like

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.120
Pitfall

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:26.680
because you're saying that you use it to get over gaps and hit switches and

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:32.040
You can use you can use it to pick up items in the game to throw at people

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:39.480
And then you can interact you know with your environment, and you swim and climb and you know

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:46.000
Jumping climbing trees that type of stuff. Well, Indiana Jones is kind of fun anyway. Yeah, I think it'd be pretty fun

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.360
And I go series is cute. Go games are so fun

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.120
I mean that's they may not be the most stellar looking games

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.680
They may be kind of dumb, but the Lego games are just fun

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.760
You know just like a movie full of sex and violence dumb fun

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.260
No, that's showgirls. Oh, sorry, which is both a movie full anyway

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:12.860
It's also coming out in the US and released North America in June as well, so around the same time as the movie

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.420
awesome

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.900
There's gonna be an update coming. Well. We've been talking about for a while now codename Bogart. Which is coming to

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:28.020
Burnout paradise it's going to be basically the next update that they have hopefully adding this

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:35.460
Brand new island to race in and going to be part of you know many different updates that they're going to have for the game

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:41.060
Some of the things that are going to be coming with it including some bug fixes

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.680
That they're going to be identifying the top 10

01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:48.180
problems that users have been facing

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.620
online functionality

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.100
balancing tweaks

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:58.020
They're gonna be fixing like the head-on takedowns which seemed unfair. I guess an unrealistic

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:02.180
unfair low-speed takedowns have been removed and

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.100
Then they're gonna also be of course adding you know

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:09.460
the brand new tracks and or

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:15.340
Portions of the game and hopefully some new cars to download all this is supposed to happen April

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.300
24th so I guess a lot to happen in a day. Yeah, and so I guess we'll have to

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.060
Stay tuned to see what that is. I'm interested in it

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:27.860
I'm actually gonna start playing the game again once it comes out, but only briefly because you know

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:32.420
Paradise kind of wore out quick. I don't think I like the open-world thing

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.180
I think I'd like my burnout the way it was I don't like what they did to it. I like the open-world

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:40.460
It's just I don't know yeah, I know I'm being so hypocritical because I loved it in test drive

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.020
Maybe that's why I'm kind of like it's just when I played burnout

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:47.160
I played this before a lot of grinding is what it is because a lot of like okay

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:52.840
You finish this many races now you have to do it all over again to get this next license

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.040
And I got to do it all over again

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:58.220
Where it's like the crash modes and stuff like that of the you know older games

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:05.880
They you know provided different scenarios and stuff to play through whereas this game. You can kind of crash anywhere, but there's only really

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:11.920
Specific spots that you're going to kind of want to go to where you can get enough points to you know get to the next

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.760
License well burnout paradise is not the only game that's getting a patch this week

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:22.840
Layer is also going to be getting a patch very soon. It's coming out in Japan on April 17th

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:27.620
That's probably the same day. You're likely to see it everywhere else the biggest thing that you're getting in this patch

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:35.600
Not just rumble support for the new rumble controllers coming out the dual shock threes, but now you're going to get analog controls

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.520
Finally you don't have to just control with the six axis controller

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:47.660
You can also there will be a new targeting icon that shows up and now you can download wind dragon and poison dragon

01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:50.320
The different types dragons that you can use in any old stage

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.160
I wonder if this will change people's opinions on the game because some of the people you know biggest bitch

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.500
They had was the controls yeah, if they fix the controls. I'd be really interested to see how the game plays out

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:05.320
I want to see some people just some not everybody but some people that reviewed this game before like re-review it if that makes sense

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:12.320
They may actually I'd be curious to see that which is very interesting if a patch has that big of an impact on a game

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.720
You know what? I mean? Well, I'll teach them to stick with the stupid motion controls

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.660
Hmm only you know they should have it as an option. Hmm. Just like rumble

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.760
true

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.880
Well some good news for our friends over in the UK is that

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:36.400
one of the retailers shop to is confirmed that they are going to be selling a Grand Theft Auto for

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.080
hardware bundle that will have

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:48.080
The 40 gig ps3 6-axis and a copy of GTA 4 and it will be out on the 29th of April for 299 pounds

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.800
Which is for the equivalent of a 590 bucks for us?

01:16:51.800 --> 01:17:00.960
Nice any word on something like that coming over here. Not that I've seen hmm

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.640
Are you surprised Loki at the lack?

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.960
I mean, I know you're big on Grand Theft Auto 4 and this is supposed to be like a system selling type game

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.960
I have actually heard people thinking of investing in a PlayStation 3 because they want to get Grand Theft Auto and

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:18.440
For whatever reason there's more games on the ps3 than interest them as opposed to Xbox 360

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:25.160
Why isn't Sony jumping on the opportunity over here? I don't know probably because they have a new bundle coming out with

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.520
Metal Gear Solid 4 I mean if they were going to do a bundle they would have already announced it by now I

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.920
Don't know. Maybe they're just not selling as well over

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:41.400
Say you know in Europe and stuff. Maybe they're really needing to push them. That's why they have all those extra bundles over there

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:48.920
Really though and they've been having trouble keeping the bundles or actually these systems in I think

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.200
Although we haven't been selling them too fast

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:58.280
I know so and I mean I went to Fry's the other day, and they had pallets of just ps3s just sitting there, so

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.060
It's not like there was a shortage of them. It's just people

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.760
need games to play on it and

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.960
I guess Grand Theft Auto will be one of those games. It'll be one they'll sell systems, but at the same time. I think you know

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.040
Just if people actually realize hey

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.180
there's a lot of games on 360 as well, and it's coming out on there, but

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:22.680
To each his own I guess whatever their preference is

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:31.540
So one thing though that's kind of disappointing is the PlayStation Network will be going down tomorrow for about 15 hours

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:35.580
But not a big deal like because it will be coming back

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:42.420
Shortly after that with the brand new PlayStation store. It's going to be completely redesigned

01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:45.400
I'm going to have a bunch of new features in there as well

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:51.860
supposed to be a little bit easier to browse kind of like the I don't know sink star store a little bit and

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.100
Some of the cool things that they're going to have on there as well

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.780
hopefully

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:00.460
the home

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.820
beta will be coming out pretty soon, but

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:07.940
You know lots of stuff to look forward to and it's nice to see that

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:13.060
They're actually updating their store because it was pretty hard the browse through and this looks a little bit better

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:20.340
Yeah, it's a I think the PlayStation store kind of needed some look and feel changes to it

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.660
So I hope this goes well for them

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:29.280
You know what other store needs to look and changes that fucking virtual console store needs some serious updates

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.280
well

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:37.080
Going from hardcore updates and news to big old rumors. This is take this with a big grain of salt

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.920
Apparently this is coming over from game reactor

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.280
Some blogger on there has said that apparently John Woo is going to announce the Metroid film at

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.080
Next week's comic-con in New York City

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:54.280
Here's the deal with it. It's going to star

01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.840
Christiana Loken and she was the main actress in blood rain

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.360
apparently

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.840
But thank God is not being directed by a bowl like blood rain was and God

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:07.680
And apparently there's a little picture that made its way through it that says

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.760
5209 like a release date May 2nd of 2009

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.200
So now here's the thing is that you might go bullshit, but there are some pieces of it that add up

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:21.320
John Woo purchase the rights to Metroid although that was a couple years ago

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:27.540
But he did and he's gotten involved with video games before because there was stranglehold right was a John Woo game as well

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.160
so

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:34.260
Kind of interesting I think the release date makes this fault because I think if this were true

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:41.680
The movie would already be filming and I don't know that seems like a pretty aggressive release date to just like unless they're gonna like start

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:45.200
Filming it this summer. I guess they could really see it can change. I mean, it's just

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:51.840
Good. Well, I think also keep in mind that a lot of times especially for seek for projects that they're gonna

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.680
Hype quite a bit and when I actually push out there that they'll start filming them under a false name, but

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:05.600
Still I just with the amount of buzz that a game like this would get I would think that something would leak

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.320
You know what? I mean, I

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.920
Don't know. I

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.240
Don't know if they're doing it all on a soundstage

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:17.180
You know also all the work that they could be doing right now could be up now maybe going in reverse a little bit doing

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:23.200
A lot of the CG work now and then going back and then filming this stuff and then adding the CG stuff in there

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.200
I don't know

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.480
There's modeling

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.840
Yeah, I would just think the special effects that a Metroid movie would take are gonna take too long unless they've already been doing them

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:36.640
But again if they've already been doing them some dude on a blog somewhere would not have been the first one to notice this

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.240
It's gonna really suck

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.760
That would be sad. That would be very sad

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.620
Because after all the we both films, you know, they don't take that long to put together. So

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.600
bite your tongue

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.560
Metroid set in like a Western or something like that. All right. Well, we're about to the end of the first half of our program

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:00.580
That's right. You guys listening at all games calm for the first time possibly to our show. We're a long show

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:01.640
We're about a three hour show

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.900
We're about to the end of the first half of our program

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:09.060
But we don't end part a until we have a chance to go back and look at the classics

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.680
And I guess I already did that a little bit during my gaming week

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:16.400
I talked about one classic game that wasn't the official game of the week dark Sakura likes to you know

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.760
She's got the massive collection. She was talking about earlier

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:24.640
She likes to dig through her collection every week and find one game to spotlight for those you guys

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.860
Pay a little respect to the classic video game of the week

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:35.080
So dark Sakura what classic video game have you selected for the crowd this week?

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.840
This is another one that makes my heart hurt that it's considered a classic now

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:45.360
Um, but it came out on PlayStation and it's bus to move. I'm not talking about puzzle bobble

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.720
it came out over here as this is bust a groove because

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.560
Puzzle puzzle bobble came out as best to move already and therefore had the license in the u.s.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:13.560
Um, but in Japan, it was best to move. Let's take a listen

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:19.360
Whoever's playing this kitty and is actually doing pretty good and the video file that we are playing this from is actually the person playing

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.760
On the mode with no commands. I don't know if you noticed that Rob. Yeah, I know that

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.600
I was like something's wrong with this when I was looking at it. There's no arrows that you hit in

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.760
Yeah, that's actually when I was at my height of playing this game. I used to play it without hands

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.880
Everyone has the same damn moves. You're probably gonna have to explain for our listeners how this is different from DDR

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.460
okay, and basically what bus to move is it's sort of a

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:45.140
versus dance game where you

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:50.880
put in the commands that it brings up on the screen and you do them you hit your

01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:56.840
Trigger, but I guess I usually call it the trigger. Whatever your last command button is to activate those moves

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:03.360
Right on the beat. So you have to have good rhythm to make sure that you're you're hitting this, right? And

01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:10.560
Some of the songs go from super easy to super hard to just being easy and then having tricky parts

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:17.040
Like this one in fact at the very end of this part is where the trickiest part of the song for me is

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.640
But and as you might have just heard where it says high scoring moves

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.920
You actually have secret moves that when it comes up to the character's

01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:30.440
Solo part if you know what that command is then you can put in those moves and it boosts your score even more

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:36.160
It has a bunch of different characters had different songs each you had

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.720
Different styles they actually changed quite a bit though when the US version came out you had Frida

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:47.440
Gaso ham who was the hamburger guy I thought he was great heat hero

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.960
Who was the disco guy Kelly who was a fetishist? She was a slut basically

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.760
He had kitty and kitty Nakajima

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.280
Who was sort of like I guess like the she was in some Senshi, you know TV show

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.880
Pinky who's a stripper and she's actually pretty cool shorty. Who's the little girl?

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:14.760
And you had strike who's the sort of gangster sort of and then you had hidden characters like you had burger dog who used hands

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:22.320
Dance moves who's in hand stage capoeira which were two silver aliens that did capoeira style dancing

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:29.000
Columbo that was shorty's pet mouse and robo zee who was actually the the boss of the game and

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.840
When you fight robo zee robo zee's like a really freakin tall and you're like, oh my god

01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.720
she's like a really freakin tall and you're like maybe the size of a finger and

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.920
You're actually on top of the building and it's in the middle of the street causing accidents and wrecks. Hey, it's it's um, capoeira

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.880
but

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.880
Capoeira was also

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.560
Called Kiki and Lala which I thought was pretty funny. So when the game came out in the US they

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:12.200
See, this is the good version if you can turn up a little bit. Okay, this is they played this song in English and it sucked. The woman could not sing for crap.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:18.960
They actually did they edit it quite a bit like when strike comes out you drink from a flask and

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:26.880
And um, they change it to a can of coke they took out hero's cigarette they changed certain lyrics for being I guess

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.160
Racially charged and also removed references to McDonald's and Burger King

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.920
They like I said, they did some of the songs in English which just was awful

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.760
Oh my god, they left fritas in Japanese, which I don't understand

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.160
and then

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.880
And also with the stages though is that if you did a

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:56.320
7-point combo which you know that was getting up to the most difficult stage of doing those special combos

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.520
You could get the levels to do like neat stuff like for this stage here capoeira stage the doors would pop off and you'd either

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.960
Be in the air you'd be in outer space depending

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:11.720
If you play shorty and pull one off her mouse jumps out of her pocket starts dancing with her

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:16.560
Um, this game is so it's just really one of my okay

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.560
I first played this when someone brought over

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:25.760
Their copy that it only been at like a week in Japan and I imported it like as soon as payday hit

01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:32.660
Um, I know this bugs you when I call it this but bust a move too was my first rhythm game ever here in the u.s

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:37.860
And that that you know without that game. I probably would not be here on orange lawns radio today. So I

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.520
Totally love this series as well

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:47.200
best to move to and I've and the reason why I'm not really combining them is because actually best to move to

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:50.440
To me is sort of a different game

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.680
because

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.580
Each character had their own set of special commands instead of having

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:02.120
Everyone having the same move, which is why you can play best to move in

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:10.480
Without the commands because everybody had the same damn commands and I actually had one of the first English fan sites on this game

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:16.000
And it's gone. It's been dead. But the link is still on the anime web turnpike if that's any any

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:22.960
Indication of how long I've had that site fever time. Yeah character does really well

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:26.500
They get to bust out of solo. It's pretty awesome. And the endings are funny, too

01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.240
but best to move to had individual moves for everybody had

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.800
Easy mode which it was all just using fans with the arrows

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:41.320
You had the medium mode which is plays pretty much just like the first bus to move and he had mix mode which uses

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:46.320
The triangle scored everything and you also had attacks too, which you if you timed your tag

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.760
Just right you could completely botched their entire solo

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.760
Now really quickly here before we go to break because we got to kind of wrap the segment up

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:57.940
Why do you think this series kind of died off because you know, we had these games we had dance summit

01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:59.940
Which was kind of met, you know

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.740
It's just it wasn't really the same. Why did this series?

01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:08.580
Why haven't we seen more games in this series, especially with how popular music games have been in this day and age?

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:13.820
Because annex needs to get off their ass and just to do it, you know, we never got dance summit over here

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:19.740
And just to let and to give people a quick explanation dance summit is actually sort of a teen dance game

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.340
where you have team versus team and

01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:27.160
Based on whatever your command button is at the end of your sequence

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.700
You have different people in your team that do different dance moves and different solo moves

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.580
we have like a bunch of people that look like heat from the first one and

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:40.320
it was a lot more interactive and had really good music and it even had a special controller that came out with it that had

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:46.620
something that you wear sort of like a grip that you would push the buttons and hold it sideways and

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:52.700
They really tried to innovate the series and I thought the best remove too was going in the right direction

01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.940
But they haven't done anything else with it

01:29:55.940 --> 01:30:02.820
I think that maybe because of how poorly dance summit did that maybe they thought that it was just time to end the series

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:04.820
I don't know sad, but

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:09.640
What they need to do is go back and do another one that plays like best move to

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:16.020
All right, we gotta wrap up but that is your classic game of the week folks. It is bust a move

01:30:16.020 --> 01:30:20.540
How can you not like a game that has a gigantic voguing robot or if you're here in the u.s

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:24.660
You find it under bust a groove because I guess the name bust a move is already ten toward it

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:26.660
I

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:32.140
Didn't think the US version I had the US version of bust a bust a groove to I guess you could say it wasn't that

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:36.020
Bad I mean for you know Rob's first music game because I didn't know what else was out there

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:38.020
I had a blast with it, you know

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:44.740
According to sauce the series died off because people suck. I guess that is true real quickly called tippo and chat asked

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.740
What could they put in a bust a groove sequel?

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:53.560
Honestly, just more the same on next-gen get rid of online Xbox live get rid of bio bring that gas. Oh

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:57.600
Yeah, here's a great the Xbox what a great Xbox live arcade game

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:02.040
This might make that would be good and you know what they should have. I think hmm. They should have

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.840
You know, you can do create about rest, you know in wrestling games

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:10.500
You can do create a wrestler and customize all of their moves every single one based on what you put

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.280
all you have to do is

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:18.440
have a create a dancer mode and you'd give them different combo moves or give them a style of dance and

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:26.360
What you do is you go in and make your character the way you want them to and then give a sign their style of dance

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.080
All right. I think that that should come out another dream game

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:31.800
All right

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.680
There you have it here on orange lounge radio your classic game of the week

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.600
Bust a move or bust a groove depending on where you live. Did you at Loki? You've been awfully quiet

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.200
Did you ever play that series? I would think you've probably touched that at some point. I played a demo of

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:49.200
Bust a groove just wasn't the same thing. It was just didn't like it as much because there wasn't actual you didn't actually dance or anything

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.200
You know, it's just kind of

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:56.940
Can't please everybody. That's all right. All right, we are gonna take a quick break here on orange lounge radio
