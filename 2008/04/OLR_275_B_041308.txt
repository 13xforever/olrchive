Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast.
We now tape live on allgames.com every Sunday night.
We got a small little crowd.
Hello to everybody in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com, who are listening to us and our brand new sound quality as well.
Lots of compliments on the sound of the show tonight.
We're excited to be here.
We got lots more stuff for you in part B, more gaming news.
We have the mailbag.
We're giving away a stupid award tonight and...
We've got an interview with somebody pretty rad, Farbs, the man behind Rom Check Fail.
We'll be talking to him very shortly.
But first, more gaming news.
Yes, Loki?
Yes.
Anyways, so this is not a big surprise because we've been seeing sorts of similar bands with other rock star games.
But this time, Brazil has banned Bully.
of course you know before the whole banning problem was Manhunt 2 now for whatever reason they've deemed it inappropriate for sale and the ban has prevented the game from being imported distributed sold or promoted on the websites and stores in the country apparently Brazilian distributors retailers
We'll have 30 days to comply with the ban.
Not acceptable.
Apparently, of course, Take-Two will not have a material impact on the sales of their popular title.
Doesn't sound like they're going to appeal it.
If you're in Brazil and you want to play Bully, oh well, guess you're out of luck.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
It's in a school.
They haven't played the game.
They didn't see what content's in the game.
They're just, oh, because it's in a school and bullies in the title must be because you're a bully.
So we don't like it.
I'd be curious to hear.
I know we've got to have some listeners in Brazil.
Because we've got listeners from around the world.
I'd be kind of curious to hear this from their perspective.
And I want to know, can you go walk into your big game stores there?
I don't know if you have the same type of things we do here.
Well, they have 30 days to comply, so go quick.
Okay.
I'm curious, can you walk into a store and buy Bully on the PlayStation 2?
Or have you been able to do that in the past?
That's what I'm kind of curious about.
We'll see.
DarkSakura, what do you think about banning video games in countries?
Retarded.
I think that banning anything is...
Unless we're banning the ferret.
No.
Just kidding.
I understand to an extent why people, why things are illegal.
You know, why certain things that they think might be harmful to the development of children.
But, you know, I believe that it's not the government's place to decide.
It's the parents' place to decide.
I guess despite all our bitching in Part A about the way society is right now, I guess we should be thankful where we live in a place where at least we have that decision to make.
Where you don't see the country banning things.
They'll just give a shit for it.
Oh well.
All right, well, moving on to other, you know, I don't know if I would call this happy news.
I don't think it's really happy for these people that were working at Develop.
Develop was a gaming company, and unfortunately, they have just lost some projects because the staff was cut from 25 down to just six senior staff.
President Michael Scandizzo, though, says, I guess he's optimistic, he says, if somebody came in tomorrow and said, here's a whole bunch of money, can you get back up and running?
Then by Monday, we could be back up and running.
Hehehehehehe
So, if you were hoping for Yaris 2, I don't know if that's really going to happen now.
I guess I kind of feel bad for these guys, though.
They were probably paid a crap load of money for what couldn't have been a too difficult a game.
They might have had all these other projects we'll never know about that could have been pretty rad.
And they couldn't get one right.
But, I mean, it was Yaris.
If you're hoping for Yaris 2, then you're probably a masochist.
I don't know.
Ajustin in chat says, let them die.
Chat.OrangeLunchRadio.com if you want to participate.
Can't save them all.
I guess that's true.
Don't worry, EA's hiring, right?
Just kidding.
Anyway, can I give us some good news?
We actually have a video now of a new character for Street Fighter 4 who is named Rufus, and he's actually bigger than E. Honda.
and he's supposedly really fast for being bigger than E. Honda so interesting there's also another character called El Fuerte
Who is supposed to be just an overall playable character.
I don't really see anything, though, about how the character moves.
He's a Mexican wrestler.
Hey, that's cool.
I like the luchadores.
He's actually pretty fast.
I've watched some gameplay footage of him.
Now, Rufus, though, that guy is pretty fat.
He kind of reminds me a lot of...
Jack Black, Nacho Libre
DJ Janai in chat says, King Hippo is the king of fat dude characters in games.
Yes.
True statement.
Whatever happened to King Hippo?
Okay, so I'm looking at this El Fuerte, and he's actually pretty cool.
He fights very much in a, sort of a Vega style, I'm thinking.
But it is very, yeah.
Yeah.
DarkTetsuya in chat, it throws back to another Capcom classic, says he reminds me of one of the characters in Slam Masters.
Remember Saturday Night Slam Masters?
Oh my god, this guy is hideously fast.
He actually sort of reminds me of, who was that guy from Art of Fighting with the cookies?
Oh god, I don't remember.
The one with the green outfit and suspenders?
No, that was Chang.
That was Fatal Fury.
Fatal Fury.
That was Fatal Fury.
Was his name Chang something?
Yeah, something.
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
I know I've seen Art of Fighting.
Yes, he threw cookies.
Rufus is kind of like if I kept eating and eating and eating and eating and then became a fighter.
He has jiggle.
He has belly jiggle.
He looks like Pom!
He looks like Pom in Homestar Runner.
Lots of diverse characters apparently coming to Street Fighter 4.
I'm kind of excited by this.
It sounds like there's a lot of people in Street Fighter 4.
Not only do you have the original fighters, now you have some of these new people too.
We have the Crimson Viper, other people we've heard about in previous shows.
Street Fighter 4 is going to be a good time, I hope.
But the question is, will it blend?
Will it blend?
Maybe.
I don't know if Rufus can fit in the blender.
Now, this is interesting, and once again, goes to show you that the Sony platforms are just not that safe against hackers.
Apparently, though, there's been a tool that's been developed called PS3 Proxy.
And what this program has done is actually allowed people to be able to download the PlayStation Home beta without actually having to participate in the beta.
So they're able to...
Modify a few files that they've downloaded from a server to allow them to download the beta even though it's not available to them.
Word is right now, though, that you're unable to actually play the beta, but there has been some video of people that have been able to play the beta despite the fact that it was previously thought you couldn't.
Either way, though, the thought is that it's going to be public pretty soon anyways, so might as well just wait a few weeks for it to come out, but
In the meantime, though, it's very interesting, though, that you can download it as, you know, it's not that difficult from what I was reading into.
I just haven't gone around to actually trying it yet.
Where is freaking home already?
I mean, they've been talking about this for over a year now, you know, and we have yet to really see much more than screenshots.
Well, that's probably hanging out with Spore and I'm sorry, but that's the same thing forever.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But really, it's not right around the corner.
And even Microsoft's kind of guilty of this, too, with the whole XNA thing.
Yeah, that's cool that they showed us that little snippet around...
Game Developers Conference and that kind of time.
But when's it actually coming out?
Not for a while.
So that's kind of lame.
And then with Nintendo and the whole WiiWare service, yeah, they've been teasing that for a long time.
Good point.
I guess it's not just Sony.
It's just easy to pick on Sony for whatever reason.
Well, yeah.
But at least they've given us a date on WiiWare of sorts.

Sega Racing Studio has closed.
Quote, the decision is part of a review of Sega's Western Development Studios to ensure that each studio is a profitable entity in its own right.
And unfortunately, the Sega Racing Studios five-year plan would not result in a successful return for the Sega business moving forward.
Or you could probably just look at the sales of Sega Rally Revo because that's the one game they made.
And sadly, I think it was just...
Especially in racing, it's so competitive right now with these next-gen systems.
There are so many racing games out there right now, right?
I mean, look at what they have on these next-gen systems.
Just on the Xbox 360, you had games like Full Auto, Test Drive, Forza, Burnout.
I can go on and on.
Dirt.
Just tons and tons of racing games.
This is just a very competitive market.
So, that's two studios closed in a week.
Sad.
Both racing games.
Yaris was a game?
Yeah, I wouldn't really call it Yaris.
I wouldn't put that quite on the same level as Sega.
But it's just kind of like potential.
You would think potential.
By the way, going back to something we were bringing up a little bit earlier.
I know I'm a little late on this, but the Rob D is a fighting game guru.
And he said the character, Green Guy Throws Cookies, Chang Shin-Zan.
That was it.
I remembered his name.
There it is.
Couldn't remember the full name.
We had a Fatal Fury special at my school.
I never played Chang anyway.
It was all about Kim Kap-Wan.
Actually, I have to agree with you.
It was him and Mai were always the ones I'd use.
And Yuri's butt attack.
She had butt attack, and that was great.
Any character who attacks with her butt.
Except there is a fighting game that has a character that fights with her butt, and the game kind of sucked, and that was the Sailor Moon Super S fighting game.
Which was the first game I've ever imported.
It was a Sailor Moon fighting game.
So, now that we have this little tidbit about me, going back over as far as the rumor mill is concerned, there has been rumored a new Ace Attorney game to be coming out that has been called Gakuten Saiban Perfect Prosecutor and it should be starring Edgeworth.
Objection!
Overruled.
Fumitsu
Apollo Justice is sexy, has connected.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Throws them all into a blender, basically, resulting in unique and nostalgic gameplay.
Basically, kind of what you do in this game is that one minute you might be Zelda in a Mario level, and you're trying to stab the asteroids with your sword.
That would be Link.
But then the next minute, well, you know what I mean.
But then the next minute, you're in the asteroids level, and then suddenly you're Pac-Man, and you have to find the dot on the screen to eat the things from Kix that are flying around the screen.
But when you find it, they turn into Blue Ghosts.
Hey, how you doing, Farbs?
Not bad, not bad.
So you're the guy that wrote Rom Check Fail.
Was it a solo effort?
Did you do this all yourself?
Or how did this happen?
Usually I work alone.
It's just easier that way.
Coordinating the project between multiple people is way too hard, especially when you want to do something a bit silly.
How long did it take you to do the whole thing?
Well, I'm not sure if you saw, but it was part of the video game name generator contest over at Seagate Source, so the whole thing had to be completed within three weeks, which is why it's a pretty small game, but, you know, that's why.
Wow, it's very impressive considering it was done in three weeks.
I had heard it was, like, the winner.
Didn't you end up winning that competition, too?
I did, I did.
Congratulations, well deserved.
How did it get from competition rules to this finished product?
Were there certain rules that made you want to go in this direction of developing this game, or what happened?
I think you tapped into a little bit of controversy there because the contest had one rule that you had to use this video game name generator website to come up with a name for your game and then make that.
And that's something I didn't actually do.
Uh-oh, what happened?
Did you get a really bad name out of it or something?
No, no, what happened was I kind of started in that direction so I started sort of looking at the generator and
running it a couple times, coming up with different names, having to think about how it works, and thinking about ways that I could hook in an exciting game with that.
And what I saw pretty quickly was that the generator was coming up with a couple of different concepts and just kind of mashing them together, which, if you've played ROM Check File, you'll see is certainly a part of ROM Check File.
So anyway, I saw that and I thought, hey, you know what would be awesome is a game that actually generates lots of the games that come out of the generator.
Oh, I see.
That's pretty cool.
It's kind of like you threw all these games in a blender and out comes this.
So it wasn't necessarily that you had the idea to begin with.
The blending of the names kind of inspired the blended game idea.
Yeah, totally.
So I was going to do stuff that actually came out of the generator, but I realized, possibly also with the help of some advice from a friend, that...
When somebody sees an emu on the screen and there's a dragon flying by, they don't know what that means, right?
Whereas if they see Mario and they see some space invaders, they totally get that immediately.
The first time I played ROM Check Fail, it took me a minute to get it.
But just imagine how much work it would have been if you didn't actually know what the characters were or the ways that they interacted with each other.
So not only was it kind of tapping into the whole nostalgia vibe, but it also communicated to the player much more quickly what the hell was going on.
I guess that's a very good point because eventually you kind of figure out, okay, if I'm Pac-Man right now, I better eat this dot before I try to touch something or I'm going to be in trouble.
So...
Yeah, that's right.
Whereas if you were a penguin and you had to go pick up a water lily before you could eat things, you would never think of that.
Unless I was playing the penguin and water lily game, I don't know.
Maybe it would be in the title.
Do you think it's that nostalgia is part of the reason why this game has spread like wildfire amongst all the gaming blogs and the internet and caught on?
I think that has helped a lot, yeah.
Which is a shame, because that's not really what the game was meant to be about.
But, you know, I'll take it.
What is the game meant to be about?
Well, whenever I make a game, I usually think about it just starting with a gameplay concept first, so I think about the way the game's going to play.
I don't really think too much about what it looks like or the narrative or anything like that.
And this game, like I was saying, was about matching different kind of archetypal characters together, just kind of throwing them in a scene and saying, deal with it.
What was the question again?
No, that's okay.
I guess we were talking about that it's spreading along the blogs and it's kind of like Wildfire and the nostalgia.
Is the nostalgia part of why this game you think is caught on so popular?
Oh, right, right, right.
Yeah, I think that's half of it.
You look around, you're going to find a lot of games that take Mario sprites and chuck them in a game or that kind of thing.
So it's not unique.
What's largely unique is the way that it uses them and the fact that there is a playable game underneath.
Absolutely.
Did you have to recreate all of the Mario, and I don't know if this might be a controversial thing I'm asking, so you can feel free to say no comment, but did you have to recreate all those sprites and the music and everything, or were you able to kind of, I don't know, I guess, borrow from the games that were already out there?
How much of this did you have to kind of build from scratch?
Well...
Strangely enough, this actually took most of my time.
Recreating the gameplay interactions and things was very quick when I was just using a bunch of squares.
But once I started looking at the proper sprites from all the games and the sounds and everything, it was a huge process to...
to pull it all together.
And it came from whatever source I could find first, to be honest.
So there's a lot of sprite rip pages that I used, so thanks to everybody who put those together.
All the music came from different people's websites where they've sort of reorchestrated tunes, which I then tweaked a little bit to make them sound a little bit more like each other.
and cut them up and pasted them together.
So I like to think of it as a collaborative effort from the entire internet retro gaming community.
I was going to say, I'm thinking this isn't just like a hodgepodge of a game.
It's also kind of a mixture of all these different contributions that are already out there on the internet.
So some guy who wrote Zelda sprites might have helped with this game and didn't even know it.
Yep, yep.
Actually, I haven't really got much back from it, which is a bit surprising.
I think a lot of people play the game through a direct link, so they don't even see my website, and people who do even pick it up by going through my website don't think to email me, so it's been a bit quiet.
I mean, the TIG source feedback threads have been great, but...
But unless I've explicitly asked people to talk about my game, it's usually been a bit quiet.
Well, that's a damn shame.
We need to get some of our listeners to send Farb some love for making this game for free as part of a competition.
So listeners, send Farb's a little love.
Where's the website they can get in touch with you?
Oh, www.farbs.org F-A-R-B-S Excellent.
Do you have any future projects you can talk about?
Things that might be coming to the website soon?
Because you have some other games already on the website too.
This isn't the only thing you've ever done.
You have some other games as well.
But do you have anything in the future you might want to give us some hints about?
Uh...
I would love to, but unfortunately I'm still deciding what I'm going to do next.
I've always got about a dozen ideas kind of floating around, bumping into each other, and it usually takes something to actually push me to put something together as a game.
So the VGNG compo was great for me, because I had...
Some concept about games that I wanted to make.
Suddenly I had a three-week deadline to actually do something, and so I got something done.
Whereas now I'm back in that phase of sort of thinking, oh, I don't know what I want to do next.
So there will be games coming, I can promise you that.
Excellent.
But I have no idea which ones.
Excellent.
Well, here, you know, something we at Orange Laundry have been talking about, our dream game for a long time, you know, I'll just kind of throw it out there.
If you can make a game with cats wielding lasers at each other, it might be an amazing game.
So just something to think about, maybe for the sequel.
Now, something we always ask all of our guests that come on the program because, you know, we're all gamers.
What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
Have you been playing independent games?
Are you a console gamer, PC gamer?
What kind of games have you been playing this week?
This week's been pretty quiet for me.
I've been a bit busy, so I haven't been able to get into any massive titles, so mostly for me it's been just sort of picking up indie titles, because usually you can kind of pick them up, have a bit of a play, and then put them down again, because they're not very large.
Other than that, a bit of Smash Bros., a friend of mine imported it, so we were actually able to play it, which is nice.
Awesome.
Nothing big.
Very cool.
Do you find yourself drawn to other indie games?
Do you like to kind of sample what else is out there in the indie world?
Yeah, I'd like to, but like I said, I'm interested in gameplay mechanics, and you're going to see a lot more variation of that kind of stuff in indie games.
But also, they're small and disposable, and that's really great when you've got 10 minutes free.
It's a lot better than thinking, oh, I've got 10 minutes free, I'm going to start Morrowind.
That doesn't add up.
Exactly.
I got one more question for you, and this might be opening a big can of worms, but it's something we've been kind of talking about a little bit in the past on this program, and that would be kind of the future of console gaming as we see these more independent scene friendly things start to open up, such as XNA and WiiWare and things like that.
From your viewpoint as somebody who's been kind of developing independent games, do you think that...
XNA and these things that are going to make console development a little more accessible to the indie developer.
Do you think this is going to be the next big thing in gaming?
Do you think this is going to take off or do you think PC is always where it's really going to be at?
Well, I think the XNA thing that they're coming up with where pretty much any game can get distributed is definitely going to be interesting.
But in that sense, I think it's just going to really look a lot more like PC.
I don't think we're ever going to really hit that kind of wonderland that all indie game developers hope will one day open up where, you know,
You can make a game in three months by yourself and push it out on a console and suddenly make millions and millions of dollars.
Those opportunities pop up occasionally, but they're extremely rare.
I don't know.
I think it'll open up a bit more.
I think it'll become a little bit more like PC, but I don't think we'll see any major changes.
Alright, well, Farbs, thanks so much for joining us all the way from Australia tonight.
We really appreciate it.
Farbs, he is the man that wrote Rom Check Fail.
Check him out, www.farbs.org, and you can download other games as well, not just Rom Check Fail, so check that out.
Farbs, thanks so much for being with us tonight.
Alright, cheers.
Alright, take care.
I want to listen to him talk some more.
That was really cool.
Sorry, he's gone now.
I know.
But yeah, it's something about accents, isn't there?
I want LaserCat.
And he's quite talented.
I was very surprised.
I kind of knew going into that interview that Rom Check Fail was done by pretty much one guy, but that's still very impressive.
I'm always impressed by some of the levels of talent out there.
Well, best of luck to Farbs, and thanks for taking the time to come on the show.
We appreciate it.
Are you a big fan of Rom Check Fail, Loki?
I think you were the one that showed that to me first.
I played it a bit.
I don't know.
It's one of those games that you can play for just a little bit, and then...
Leave it for a while.
That was the game that made me go, what is that music?
And then I realized it was Marble Madness.
It's like WarioWare type of thing.
It's one of those things you can just play for a little bit, and it's like total crack and fun.
You're like, okay, it's a good micro game.
I would like to see one that was just all Nintendo stuff, like Mega Man with Mario, Zelda.
Well, he might hit copyright issues with that.
Well, I guess he already is.
Yeah, who cares?
That's true.
Make something for WiiWare or something.
That's why you need to do it all underground and don't say who you are and just throw it out there on the BitTorrent.
Well, I would gather Farbs is probably not his real name.
Just speculation.
I'm just saying, though, instead of having a website and stuff, because if you do it all underground and stuff like that, they can't really stop you.
Especially if you just throw it out there.
Just let it catch the current.
Alright, well, we want to thank Farbs again for taking the time to come on the show.
All the time away from developing new games for us.
More crack for us later on.
Alright, let's get back into the gaming news.
Loki, take it away.
Alright, so here's another rumor that's coming around that's not a big surprise, but I'm interested to see that they're actually kind of going this route or...
Maybe thinking of going this route.
Rumor is that Microsoft, of course, is looking into creating a Wiimote-like device for the Xbox 360.
The motion controller is going to be codenamed Newton.
And no word on what exactly this might be.
Something, though, it will use a USB-powered sensor bar and will possibly have rumble motors as well as...
A microphone built in for voice activated games.
So it's interesting that they might be going this route.
And at the same way, I kind of think, you know, isn't that a little copycat-ish a little bit?
But everybody kind of copies everybody at some point.
And I know Microsoft has had not great success trying to tap that family market and stuff that Nintendo has, but...
Well, seeing it hasn't done bad for them.
I mean, even though amongst the hardcore, we kind of all turn our noses at it and go, it's kind of dumb.
But apparently it's been doing fairly well for them, so who knows?
I don't think as well as, say, Wii Sports or something like that.
No, I don't think... You just never know with Microsoft.
Microsoft kind of has a way of taking somebody else's idea and kicking it up a notch.
You know what I mean?
But can you imagine, though, if you will, motion-controlled games with...
360's graphics.
I mean, that'd be fucking awesome.
I don't know.
What do you think, DarkSakura?
Do you think it could be successful?
Motion control on the 360?
I opened this up to chat, too.
What do you guys think of it?
Do you think it could be successful on the 360 or is it going to feel like a cheap knockoff of Wii?
I really don't think it would be that difficult to integrate into the 360 because really all you need is just the input device.
You need your sensor bar, of course.
Oh, there went my power plug again.
I don't think that it's going to... I really don't think that it's going to be that sort of cheap knockoff thing, but I think people are going to have a preconceived notion about how it's supposed to work because they have this experience with the Wii.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
VX Jason XV, our fearless webmaster, says Microsoft wants to tap that.
Gerardimo says, I want motion control res.
Ooh, or if Space Channel 5 does come to Xbox Live Arcade, do want motion control.
Choo!
Chew.
You never know.
It'll be interesting.
You said that, and I was already starting to think of Samba de Amigo, the one with the posing.
Well, they are doing that.
I know.
That's what I started thinking of with doing your bizarro little poses.
Justin says, imagine a game that requires the camera and the motion controller.
Good idea, but imagine the highly limited audience that that's going to reach unless Xbox then puts out another bundle that comes with both, which I guess is very possible.
I don't know.
Who knows?
So, we'll continue on with the gaming news, and I want to talk about Metal Gear Solid Online.
You know, over here, you had to pre-order the game in order to get the Metal Gear Online demo, but guess what?
In the European PlayStation Store, Metal Gear Online Premiere Beta, free download on the PlayStation Store, April 17th to May 6th in Europe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If this were happening in the US, I'd go, hmm, free beta.
I'll download it and check it out.
I may not be into Metal Gear that much, but hey, if it's free, that gives me incentive to take a look, right?
Rob?
What?
Imagine technical... Imagine babies?
No.
Imagine not stumbling over your words?
Imagine tactical espionage action.
Sounds like fun, though.
Babies.
Babies.
With babies.
Yes, a tactical espionage baby game.
Metal Gear Bailey.
Metal Gear Babies.
Maybe that'll be, you know, because they have the flash forward in Metal Gear 4.
Maybe that'll be a Metal Gear 5 flash backwards.
By the way, the beta is running from April 21st to May 6th.
Which, by the way, happens to be one day less than we have it in North America.
Hmm.

That's a cool name, Trishalicious.
Trishalicious.
I hate to say it.
I'm going to make us lose a fan, but it does sound like a stripper name.
Dear OLR, didn't you hear listening to this show on my iPad?
I thought I would ask you about a recent game I purchased and I had to buy it from an online retailer.
After reading a review in Game Informer magazine about Pinball Hall of Fame, the Williams Collection, which received a high rating for only being $30, I knew I had to have it.
I proceeded to my local gaming shop, expecting them to have the game since it was...
Reviewed in their magazine, but nothing was on the shelf or listed in their computer database.
When I finally got the game after buying it online, I loaded it up and started playing.
PHF on my Wii is the best pinball I have played on a PC or console.
I wanted to try to get the word out that this game really kicks major butt as a pinball simulator.
I love it, and I want to make sure those...
Those who also love pinball to give it a try.
Now I want to go play these tables all over again if I can find them at a local arcade.
Love to you all.
Huggies.
Trishulishish.
Timbal is awesome.
Timbal is the best ever.
You know, I downloaded a new table for Timbal FX on Xbox Live this week, the Buccaneer table.
Yeah.
But I didn't get a chance to play it because I was going to download that Rocky and Bullwinkle table, but I got sidetracked my whole Phantasy Star Universe thing.
But Trishalish is not the first person to point out that that's a fun game, but I bet you especially would enjoy that.
You got it.
You Timbal whore.
Really?
Yes.
Good times?
Yes.
Yes?
All right.
How can they release a pinball collection, a Williams pinball collection, and us not have it?
Just checking.
Okay, then.
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
What?
I was shaking my head.
Anyway, next email is...
and Commentaries Forever.
That's who that is.
Hey, OLR, love your show.
Been listening for about a month and wondering a few things.
Is the ferret still there from your transition to all games?
That answer your question?
That would make me sad if it were shipped away into a box.
I've also heard rumors that Konami will make a DDR 10th anniversary game sometime around this or next year.
Could that be plausible due to licensing fees and whatnot?
Just want to know.
I can see it being plausible since they're probably running out of ideas for new DDR games anyways.
Yeah, there's not too much they can do to revise them.
So let's put a new DDR game with all the classic Konami songs.
Wait, that's like every other DDR game.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and, you know, they should do stuff like that, like, uh, third mix have paint mode or something.
You know, stuff like, and, and SSR.
Whoops.
Or you can dance to this song.
What, a hoedown?
Anyway.
That's what I get for leaving things running.
Can I... Do you have something to say about... It would not be a first show on all games if I didn't screw up somehow, so there you have it.
Do you have something to say about the ditter?
Look, I've been saying forever, if DDR wants to evolve, the game needs to be... They need to scrap all their old code, rebuild the game from the ground up, honestly make it look like Guitar Hero at this point.
I think that's the best way to make it catch on here in the US.
I hate to say it.
Or how about... Okay, how about this?
You just totally ignore all the tutorials and...
Get rid of quest mode.
For the love of God, quest mode is crap.
Redo quest mode.
I think quest mode has potential to be good, but not in its current form.
Quest mode is crap.
What they need to have, bring challenge mode back.
That's fine.
The challenge modes, I think, are a lot more fun or challenging than quest mode.
Quest mode is like, okay, play a lot of songs, go.
Oh, fun!
Nothing like repetition.
I just think if they want the DDR to continue, they should, you know, remake.
I've said it for years.
They need to make DDR, take it from being cooperative and making competitive.
But that's just me.
Or have, like, new modifiers that are song-specific that, like, certain things happen in the song and maybe integrate it with, like, you know, videos or something that I'm playing.
Like, the arrows fall down different ways or something like that.
I mean, which would be pretty cool.
Like, different themes.
Alright.
Next email.
Next email is... As soon as it loads up.
Next email comes to us from Harvey.
Oh, sorry.
It comes to us from a poorly formatted email.
Okay, I'm just going to say Harvey was the last name because they put their full name in there, so that's what I'm going to say.
Hey, what's up, OLR?
I was wondering what do you think about Sony saying DualShock wouldn't fit in a 6-axis controller and now it's there?
How ironic.
They didn't ever say it wouldn't fit.
They couldn't do it at the same time with the tilt sensor.
And it's so last gen.
It's actually the same shell.
In fact, there's actually spots for the two Rumble motors.
That's bullshit.
Do you think that redesigning the PSN store will affect the amount of content that is bought?
Will you guys be buying any games from the new WiiWare section next month?
Also, did Live365 give DarkSakura a cookie?
I will make it one of my goals as a gamer to give her a cookie.
Dude, cookies are great, but you have to get it to me by next weekend.
Because it's your birthday.
It's my birthday.
That's right.
I'm eating whatever I want to.
Lots of cookies.
And booze.
Life 35 did not give you a cookie.
In fact, they gave me a migraine.
Yeah.
I want to... They owe me a cookie and then they owe Rob money.
As far as WiiWare, yes.
I'm hoping there's some movies or something, gameplay videos that make its way to the US sites so I can learn a little more about these games than just having to take a leap of faith.
You know what I mean?
Strong bad game.
Just like, well, yeah, okay.
Maybe there's certain cases where I would take a leap of faith.
And like, I already know I want that Dr. Mario game, especially if it has like the online and everything.
But, you know, with some of those other ones, like even like Final Fantasy, I'm kind of like, honestly, I don't know if I have the room on my Wii hard drive to fit that stuff.
You know how many freaking virtual console games I have?
A sad amount.
Sad amount.
Wow.
This person has listed gamer goals, and I have to read some of these because I have to respond to some of them.
Okay.
Gamer goals?
Yes, there's 15 goals.
Are you going to read them all?
The list is not in order.
Oh.
One, be a guest on Attack of the Show either in person or webcam viewer.
Why?
Overrated.
Be a guest on X-Play in person.
Why?
Overrated.
They don't have guests anymore on X-Play.
Oh, well, I guess they don't have viewers anymore, I guess, on live viewers.
Special guest on a gamer podcast, OLR, Gamer Tag Radio, All Games Radio, IGN, EGM, OXM, GameScoop, Beyond, or Three Red Lights.
All of those?
That might be tricky.
Come to... Yeah, getting on OLR is easy.
Yeah, just show up.
Or, you know, call us on the Skype line.
It's very easy to get on the show.
Same thing with All Games Interactive, at least.
They do... Their phones are open the whole time.
I don't know how they do it.
Because they keep their phones open the whole show.
If we did that, we'd get derailed even faster than we already do.
But, you know, they have their phones open all day.
We've been on that show and it's very tangent-y too.
But it's fun.
Yes.
Four, go to E3.
You don't want to go there anymore.
I do.
Speak for yourself.
Well, I want to, but I don't think that E3 is not what it was.
So, just to let you know.
Yeah, okay.
Miss got invited last year and didn't go.
I had other things to do.
Have a game room in my future home.
That's always a good idea.
Battle it out over Major League Gaming.
Battle it out at Major League Gaming.
Okay.
Get my degree in video game design.
This is one of the ones I wanted to talk about.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Some folks in chat room are commenting on this whole E3 thing.
And Gerardimo said, I want to be a guest on X-Play four years ago.
Justin says, E3 is lame sauce now.
It's all about PAX.
Oh, God, I hope I get to go to PAX this year.
I think I'm going to go.
I want to go.
I think there's supposed to be like a big all games thing, like a Voltron thing happening at PAX.
I want to go.
So I definitely want to go.
I know, it's going to be hot.
I want to go.
What was the other thing I want to see?
Recruit number 0745 says E3 was cool before they fucked it over.
By the way, ask someone how to change your nick so we can give you your proper name.
BlackWolf says last year's E3 was the best E3 I went to and I've been to 11 of them.
Lucky you, Bobby Black.
I think that the whole point, though, is that this person might not... Dude, since we're on all games now, are we going to get into the E3 this year?
Freaking hope so.
I'll write an article.
Yeah, I know.
We'll write articles.
I'm a good writer.
Anyway, make a video game.
Well, you'll need your design creds then.
Review another company's video game.
You could do that if you got a blog.
Travel to Japan and meet the people at Konami and Square Enix.
Okay.
Go to New York and hang out with True Homie, The Rage 65, Scariest Globe, Retro King, Grow White Boy, and others.
They are some of my friends on Xbox Live.
Get my Xbox 360 autographed by the guys over at Orange Lounge Radio.
We could do that.
I need me a new Xbox 360.
And we still have to finish the faceplates.
Several people have asked about the faceplates now.
I'm almost feeling like, oh God, we're going to have to come up with some way to do this for everybody who wants one.
Or at least get autographed pictures or something.
I never thought we'd be at that level.
I want a picture of me.
Outro Music
Ah, well.
We'll figure out how to do it.
I had somebody email my personal email that once won, and, you know, Osfer was the guy that kind of started it, and we will figure something out within the next couple weeks, I promise.
So, the last three?
Yes.
Get a copy of Gears of War 1 and 2, autographed by Cliffy B. Attend the University of Advanced Technology, and give Dark Sakura a cookie.
Those are some... You would be fulfilling the being on a show, on a podcast, and the giving me a cookie one at the same time.
And even the signature, the autographed Xbox.
Yeah, I will autograph before you're here in the studio.
I know, we're awesome.
Well, here's the thing.
Where's this guy live, did he say?
No.
If you live near PAX...
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Anyway, last email is, thanks for switching to All Games Radio.
I couldn't even listen to you live on Live 365.
Anyway, I'm happy you switched seamlessly, but down to business.
I want to ask you guys, are you actually going to air the fuck show and when?
Looking forward to it, thanks for your time, Zeppelins.
Oh yeah, remember that?
We were supposed to do the fuck show.
I don't know if that's actually going to happen next week.
Because I'm going to be out of town most of the weekend.
We can't say when it's going to happen.
We've got to pick a show and not tell anyone.
See, I like that idea.
It should just fucking happen whenever the fuck it is.
The fuck show will happen.
It won't happen next week, but it'll happen before summer.
Is that fair?
Yeah, we have to have one listener in on it just because they have to keep tally, but...
We'll tell Dark Tetsuya or somebody who's been listening forever that we know is going to do a good job keeping tally.
If you don't know what the fuck show is and you didn't listen to last week's show, it's this completely idiotic and stupid idea we had that is so funny it makes us giggle in only places that whattheyplay.com snap can.
By the way, how much do I love the wiki editors?
The people that work on our wiki, which is at orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, how much do I love them?
Especially, namely, and a lot of people are getting in on it now, but namely, AJ Mix and Dark Tetsuya have been doing probably about 80% of the work, if not a little more.
I love this.
Here's the summary.
You go into the page that says Dream Games, right?
and let's see, they're all accounted for.
Skye's Voice the Game, LaserCats, Loki's World of Randomness, Rice Princess Presents Boobies and Pandas, Forbidden Bomberman, Pen and Paper, Furries, and then Cosplayers vs. Furries, and then here's the new entry, WhatTheyPlay.com Snap, a Nintendo Wii game involving taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Beautiful!
A gold star for AJ Mix, who made that edit.
Someone else emailed something that I'm actually not going to really talk much about because I can't watch it while we're live.
Someone sent me an Engineer's Guide to Cats.
Just the thought of an engineer.
That could be morbid.
I think I'm just going... Well, especially since Dan was showing Julie that South Park episode last night about sniffing cat butts.
And so that just sort of makes me think of that.
I'll watch it later, but thank you, whoever sent me an engineer's guide to cats.
And that's it.
All right.
If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to go.
Speaking of pen and paper, the game, Loki...
Yes, speaking of pen and paper, the game.
Now, the game that we're referring to, of course, is LOL, Never Party Alone.
It's a multiplayer-only game put out by H-Tech.
It's actually kind of like Pictionary, sort of.
You basically draw that will give you, I guess, a theme or a statement or something.
Like, draw a funny clown, and then you have to draw a clown or something like that.
and, you know, everybody draws it, then one person votes on it.
So it's like, I guess, Pictionary meets Apples to Apples, and then the winner gets a point.
But the thing is, as we said with Pen and Paper, the game, you can do this on Pen and Paper already, and you don't need to buy a game.
Well, unfortunately, you won't be able to buy this game in stores, because according to the game's distributor, Agetech, it will be available online only.
So, yeah, you won't find this in stores.
That's alright.
Buy a tablet of paper and pens instead.
Is it surprising?
What if you're playing it in a store?
Then it will be in a store.
You can't buy it in a store, though.
What if you were downloading it while you were in the store and paying the money while you were in that store?
No, it's not downloadable.
It's just that you're buying... You have to buy it from their online store.
What if you have your laptop and you're at a store?
Okay, I'm picky.
Just forget it.
Do you really need this game?
I mean, it's not like... What else did they sell online only?
Electroplankton?
I like Electroplankton.
I know, but that was a game that was worth buying online.
LOL?
I don't know.
I don't know about that one.
You know what the alternative to LOL is?
It's called Open Canvas...
PicktoChat.
Well, guys, we're going to get into another segment we do here on Orange Lounge Radio once in a while, and I kind of gave away what's coming earlier based on the music, but... That's right, when you hear that happy music, you know something really fucked up happened, and it's probably time to give out another OLR stupid award.
This time...
18-year-old Jean-Pierre Orlewicz He is on trial right now for first-degree premeditated murder.
Guess what him and his friend did?
They ambushed 26-year-old Daniel Sorensen in November.
They stabbed him in the back and then sawed off his head and burned his body.
This was not a video game.
This was real life.
It is not funny when it happens in real life.
It's not as offensive as two guys kissing, though.
Don't even.
Oh my god, this guy looks psychotic.
I know, seriously.
Okay, so the trial is going on right now, but here it is.
Here's what happened.
The defense is blaming Hitman.
That's right, Hitman.
Here it is from a CNN report.
They dealt with it a video game called Hitman that he used to watch.
And it was a video game where you got impressions that you would kill somebody.
Hit them from their backside where they were not aware they were being killed.
But, I don't know, that sounds a little more like Manhunt to me, but... Regardless, this guy's an idiot!
Not just for what he did.
I mean, that was stupid anyway.
But for the fact that the defense... And I guess the defense team wins the stupid award too, but trying to blame it on Hitman.
I mean, come on.
I mean, it's one thing to stab somebody and kill them that way.
But, like, that's insane.
Like, on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being, like, not really fucked up and 10 being, like, super fucked up, like, stabbing someone and killing them is at least a 12, okay?
That's beyond fucked up.
But stabbing them...
Then cutting off their head, then burning their body?
That's like $11 billion on that scale, okay?
So, you've got issues, and you need to go away for a long time, where we won't see you ever, ever again.
And don't try to blame it on a video game, ass.
Stories like this make me angsty.
You know what happens, usually after the Stupid Award comes a bout of angst, and we like to call that here our FUs of the Week.
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight with the FUs of the Week.
Okay, my FU of the Week goes towards...
People who drive really, really slow, like grandma slow, when you're going the speed limit and they're going less than the speed limit.
And I know I talk about bad drivers all the time, but oh my god, all of them were in front of me today.
And also, an FU goes towards...
The amounts of cleaning I've done in the past week in our house.
But I did get something really awesome.
I have a toy.
I call it the doctor's cleaning tool.
It's called a sonic scrubber.
and you use it for cars and I used it for the bathroom instead but anyway all of the dust that got kicked up from all the cleaning I've done for Dan's pinball gathering tonight has had my eyes bloodshot like all week so F you to dust too Loki, do you have any FUs of the week?
F you goes to this chair that I'm sitting on because it's horribly uncomfortable.
We will try to find a cheap chair for you at Ikea or something, I promise.
Ikea has comfy plastic ones.
I want to get another chair like that.
That chair is awesome, the one you sit in.
I know they can't see it on just TV because you're secretive, but it's a very nice chair.
Sorry, Loki.
Is that it?
F you to my pancreas, which continues to bother me.
I've been having chest pains today.
Although thankfully I've been getting a little bit better.
And speaking of food, I actually ate a full meal last night.
It was very nice.
I went to Mimi's.
and they have a low-fat menu.
And they have a spaghetti marinara dish that was actually pretty damn good for low-fat, but I'm so sick of this low-fat diet.
I mean, granted, it's nice to have lost 25 pounds and all, but I am so sick of eating low-fat.
Like, seriously, when Loki brought in that pizza tonight, I'm like, I would kill you for a slice of pizza.
Rob.
What?
All right.
Anyhow.
Enough about food, because I'm getting hungry, because I haven't eaten dinner yet.
That will conclude the FUs of the week, and we'll get back into the show with some more gaming news.
Well, we've already known that the U.S.
and North America are going to be getting a, I guess, limited edition Metal Gear Solid bundle with the game, of course, an 80 gig system, and...
Also, I guess, the DualShock 3 controller.
Well, now, there's also another bundle coming.
That's going to be the Gunmetal Grey PlayStation 3.
In fact, it was confirmed by Konami's Brandon Loreno on the official PlayStation blog that this very, very limited edition system will be available in North America as part of a special Metal Gear 4 bundle.
So, I guess it's the same thing, but this one's Gunmetal Silver Grey-ish.
And so I guess both these are going to be scheduled to arrive around the game's release date of June 12th.
Good luck getting your gunmetal gray one.
They're going to be super rare, basically?
Yeah, super rare.
I bet I know something that's even more rare, and I know I can say something about this now, because Bobby said it on his show tonight.
I can talk about this a little bit.
All Games Radio, which we're a part of, is going to be giving away, this is super duper rare, an Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4.
Box, okay?
There's only like 500 of these puppies in existence.
All games got one, and they're giving it away.
And they're not giving it to you, Loki, I'm sorry to say.
You're ineligible.
Stupid Rockstar.
Listen, okay, I played more of Grand Theft Auto's PSP multiplayer, and trust me, that's pretty painful, okay?
That game had some pretty bad multiplayer, but I loved it, and we played it more than anybody, any human on the face of this earth.
And yet...
You know, no love for me.
What the hell.
Well, here's the way it works on All Games Radio.
Every show that's on the network gets to pick a finalist, basically.
It gets to do a contest to pick a finalist.
So we'll be picking our finalist either next week or the week after.
But if you don't win with us, you might be able to win with Bobby Blackwolf.
You might be able to win All Games Interactive, Video Game Outsiders, Platform Nation.
Countless other shows that All Games Radio has, every show is going to send one finalist to a last round.
And I don't know what they're going to do at that point.
I gave one the freaking Mark Echo.
I mean, come on, man.
They're just like throwing them away now.
So, stay tuned.
Next week we'll have more details.
We may even do the qualifier next week.
I'll post more on the website.
I just, I have to know the all games timetable.
Either it'll be next week or in two weeks.
So, we'll see.
Okay, back to the news.
Yes, news, because ferrets are always relevant to my interests.
Something else that's relevant to my interests is the BBC and the Wii.
And they rhyme, because the BBC on the Wii is cool.
Wee!
Anyway, so there is an iPlayer replay service that the BBC has that's going to be functional on the Wii.
And the service is one that...
It's actually already available on iPod Touch and iPhone that will do limited by time different replays of BBC shows, including Doctor Who, Torchwood, which are two of my favorites, and whatever else they want.
It's for Wii owners in the UK.
I actually want to try this on my iPhone.
I would love to try it.
Um, but if anyone wants to actually see what's, um, what's playing on there, the address is bbc.co.uk slash iPlayer.
And you can see what they've got up for now.
That's pretty sweet.
I was reading this concept a little bit earlier for the show started.
I'm like, this is, this is a great next step for the Wii.
I mean, talking about wanting to be like, you know, a centerpiece in the living room with its news and forecast.
I mean, talk about being able to bring television shows like that.
I mean, even more so the next, like, what if you didn't have to pay for it?
One thing that I do want to mention that might be a problem is that the BBC's website does IP check.
For example, when the Sarah Jane Adventures were just coming out, you actually couldn't even look at their website.
It would block it completely.
and I even used two different IP directors and it still had me blocked.
But just for what's on there right now as far as featured items is actually the last episode of Doctor Who that aired the other day which was called Pompeii the Last Day.
There's also Nadodai, Open House, To Buy or Not to Buy, Freaky Eaters, Dateline London.
Yeah, if you care.
Yeah.
There's some pretty good stuff on there.
Love Soup.
I would watch a lot of BBC shows.
I kind of secretly hope they'd bring it over here.
Watch some Little Britain.
A show that my husband likes is Top Gear.
He watches episodes of that on YouTube.
But Top Gear is also available for that.
If you're a big racing or car fanatic, that's a good show.
Alright, well we'll see Well this is kind of interesting It's been, I don't know, maybe leaked out on when Animal Crossing for the Wii will be coming out
Yay!
Could be.
But, I mean, you know, last game that came out was on the DS, and that was around November, December-ish.
So, you know, it could be just a coincidence that it's coming out.
I'd be interested to see what's on the other months, you know, just to see if that kind of... That's the thing I was kind of missing.
What's in the other months?
Were some of the earlier games from this year in the earlier months?
Like, did you have, you know, Smash Bros.
Brawl in March or February?
Like Professor Layton or something for February and...
It is a bit of a stretch, but we'll see.
Well, we are about to wind down here, and we'll be taking Skype calls very soon.
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
Keep in mind that is different from the other All Games shows.
For those of you guys that are new to our show tonight, thanks to our new relationship with AllGames.com, keep in mind we do have a different phone number than the rest of their shows that are live.
Sorry, I'm going to interrupt real quick.
Mm-hmm.
They actually have someone actually has the calendar and it sounds like it may just be a coincidence because January was Mario Galaxy February was Wii Fit but this is all stuff that's Japanese dates so I don't know March was Mario Party They had April's Mario Kart May looks like they had like Yoshi's Island June something Metroid Prime related July Kirby
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Did you know that Cookin' Mama Cook-Off is the 98th top-selling game in the past 12 months?
470k units moved between North America and Europe.
Pretty cool.
That's a lot, even though the game was kind of crap compared to the DS.
Like, it lost a lot of magic on its way to the Wii.
Kind of interesting.
You're still supposed to lend me yours.
You can take it anytime.
I'm not that excited about it.
I'm just quickly looking through the list to see if there's anything else notable on it.
I noticed Boogie is in at number 87.
I don't know how I felt about Boogie.
It was a little bit corny.
Halo 3?
Halo 3, Mario Galaxy Super Mario Galaxy Assassin's Creed Pokemon Diamond and Pearl
6 was Need for Speed Pro Street, $5.4 million.
5 was Madden NFL 08, $5.7 million.
4 was FIFA Soccer 08, because remember we brought Europe into the mix, so you know a soccer game is going to sell.
$5.7 million as well.
Number 3, this surprised me, Guitar Hero 3 was the number 3 selling game of the past 12 months.
That doesn't surprise me.
Just because it's so much more expensive, $7.5 million units.
Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 8.3 million units
It's weird, though, because here on Orange Launch Radio, that's not the type of game we usually talk about.
It's just not the type of thing we play.
I even said that I liked it.
Yeah, we still have respect for it, certainly.
No, it's weird.
Imagine Fashion Designer is number 66.
Oh, my God.
You know what game's not on this list?
Imagine Babies?
No.
What?
Eye of Judgment.
Eye of Judgment is not on the list.
That is correct.
Good job, Loki.
I did notice some PS3 titles in there.
I saw Ratchet and Clank in there somewhere.
So, well, there you have it.
One more story, then we're going to open up that Skype line.
And I don't know how it's going to run tonight.
It might be kind of choppy because we have both Justin.TV and this higher bitrate streaming.
I will have to can Justin.TV during this segment if we have problems, just so you know.
We got one more story, and it's a sweet one, right, Jamie?
Yeah, it's really sweet and sappy and makes my teeth hurt.
But it's really cool.
There is a guy, and let me make sure that I pronounce his name correctly, Brian Klima, I guess?
Klima?
K-L-I-M-A?
Who, by his own account, made a custom level in...
Super Smash Brothers Brawl that says marry me and put the timer to infinite put Peach, Mario, and Kirby who was his intended fiance's favorite character and just left the TV on so when she came home and turned on the TV she's like oh you were in the middle of the game and then she saw that he had the ring in hand and he said look at the TV again and she said yes so I thought it was sweet
Tell the all-games crowd.
Your engagement over a particular movie.
I love this story.
Dan and I, we had known each other online for quite a while.
And when I moved out here, on Valentine's Day, we were watching UHF.
We were kind of broke.
I didn't have a job.
And he was working telemarketing somewhere.
But we were watching UHF and eating French baguettes and spinach dip and drinking the kosher blackberry wine.
I love how you remember every detail.
It's so girly but cute.
Oh, shut up.
I remember lots of details about lots of stuff.
And we just sort of mutually decided to get married.
I was like, we should get married.
Okay, when?
Sometime?
Okay.
I just think the fact you got married over UHF is so funny.
Weird Al brought us together.
It's time to drink from the fire hose!
Yay!
You found the marble in the oatmeal!
You should have had that at your wedding.
The fire hose.
We didn't actually have a wedding.
Yeah, but at your, you know, you should have at least, you know, outside the courthouse.
I wore a black corset and a purple skirt and boots when I got married.
That's awesome.
And then I had cake and it was good.
And then we went home and I slept in the next day.
Romantic Odd1 in chat says, God, if I had a nickel for every time I got laid because of UHF You'd owe money Yeah, DJ Morpheus follows up with a zinger, you'd owe five bucks What's that old saying, great minds think like me?
No, Dan says it.
Great minds think like us.
Alright.
Skype line's open.
1-877-GAME-OLR Again, I apologize.
This is a little bit experimental.
We'll see how this first call works out.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's GS68.
Hello, GS68.
What is on your mind, my friend?
Um, I have a question for Loki about Arikard Lee.
Alright, what's up, Loki?
Or what's up, GS68, for Loki?
Um,
Have you played online yet?
Yes.
How is the online, like, if someone disconnects, will they get replaced by CPU without you knowing, like in Brawl?
I don't think anyone disconnected in the ones that I played, but you can choose between matches or whatever to leave or continue on to another race or something like that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'd assume they would lose points because the way the rankings work, you start off with 5,000 points when you first start playing and then depending on where you place within the 12, you'll lose up to like 64 points and then gain maybe 64 points.
So I'd imagine if they disconnected, whatever it put them in last.
Sorry, go ahead.
Um, Caram's saying that they can't hear me.
I have the mic turned all the way up.
You were a little quiet, but that's okay.
It might be on our end.
Just keep talking.
Don't listen.
Don't let them bully you in chat.
Well, anyway, that's what turns me off from playing Super Smash Bros.
Online with anyone mode.
Because if...
The game will disconnect you.
The game will replace the disconnector with a CPU and not tell you.
What's the point of playing online anymore?
I mean, I guess we'll just play against three CPU characters.
Honestly, GS68, there really wasn't one, and I think they just put it in as an afterthought to say they did it.
That's my honest answer.
Because it sounds like Mario Kart Wii has a much more robust type of online.
I didn't even know it had that whole ranking.
It has leaderboards.
It has a bunch of stuff, and you can look at your friends and see where they are at different times and stuff.
You can download the top rankers, their ghost data, and race it if you want to.
But not all that stuff works too well right now because of...
They're getting hammered, so trying to download ghost data didn't work for me.
I tried a few times and it didn't work.
In fact, I had to hammer online to finally get into a game.
It took me about 10 tries and I finally got to play an online game.
That'll get fixed eventually, I'm sure, but right now it's just getting hammered pretty bad.
Any other comments, GS68?
Or questions?
DMN DMN DMN
I'll be honest, it's very similar to the type of thing you've probably seen on GameFAQs in the past But it wasn't with characters, it was with games And he was trying to find the best game of all time Of which Super Metroid ended up winning last week For which I got called every name in the book Because it was separated by one vote Yes, even amongst all the chatters, all the hosts in studio Of which we had quite a few guests last week It was separated by one vote And I cast the deciding vote to make Super Metroid win over Chrono Trigger And I took a lot of shit for it
But yeah, we did not actually send in a qualifier list because DMN closed it off early.
But what would you want to ask about that?
Yeah.
I would like to ask our listeners what games they wish they had nominated.
I mean, some games that are very big were on the brackets.
I mean,
So basically, the kind of thing like, you know, what was missing, what should have been there, what wasn't on the brackets that should have been.
I think, honestly, the sampling was a pretty good sampling of the mainstream best games that there were out there.
I think, honestly, you would be diving into everyone's niche gaming.
to see what it is they missed.
You know, if you're an RPG fan, you probably said, oh, where was Grandia?
Or where was, you know, some niche RPG?
If you're a racing game fan, you were probably like, oh, where was, you know, Burnout or whatever it is, so.
Well, I mean, I'm surprised to see that, like, obscure games like Massive Twin Allegiance are in the brackets, yet a game like Castle Venus, which did so much for the Castle Venus series, it basically took
They combined 2D action, adventure, gameplay, and RPG elements That game was not on there
Yeah, Castlevania is one of my favorite games too.
We'll see.
It's going to be interesting, though, because if we were to do something all-encompassing of all games, you take a show like All Games Interactive, and a lot of those folks are really into the sports titles and the Call of Duties and the things we don't give enough time to on this show.
So I think it would be very interesting to bring those two worlds together and see what still comes out on top.
We'll see what happens.
GS68, we've got to let you go so we can get some more calls in, but thanks so much for the phone call, buddy.
All right, take care.
All right.
All right, we're going to take some more calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
But looky, looky, we got a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
I think we got lag issues.
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
Okay, call dropped.
That sucks.
Try it again.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Mr. VXJasonXV.
Alright, we'll give it one more try.
If you want to give us a call here on Orange Lounge Radio, the lines are open now.
That last call didn't go so well, so we'll have to edit that out.
But we're taking more calls.
Let's go to this call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Did everybody drop their mics on the ground?
Hello?
It's Zaku.
Yes, I'm here.
Hi, Zaku.
What's on your mind?
Nothing much, just trying to congratulate you on your new home and everything now.
Our fresh digs.
Nice of you to actually hold something for us at the house.
It's awesome.
You know what?
I got to say this.
I want to say this real quick, Zaku.
I really want to thank everybody who's tuning in tonight.
Both Bobby Blackwolf before us and us, we have exceeded more live listeners than we've ever had.
Ever.
With the exception of E3 specials we've done.
We've brought in more people.
But who knew the Voltron of podcasting would work?
Both Bobby and us are benefiting from this.
Think about it.
You guys are meant for each other.
I mean, think about it.
I mean, it was... I'm surprised you guys didn't do it soon enough and dislike 365, you know, probably like a year, you know, a year earlier.
I mean... Yeah, hindsight's always 20-20, isn't it?
Look, you got a question?
What's on your mind?
Uh, basically... Alright, since I managed to get a PSP last Friday and managed to get it hacked, I need some good, you know, some good apps.
Loki, I mean, you... I know you gotta help me out with a little bit or something.
What else can I put on my PSP in terms of homebrew?
What now?
I'm sorry.
I couldn't understand him.
I just turned down the bandwidth on JustinTV, so hopefully it'll get a little better.
He wants to know PSP apps he should have.
I don't know.
I haven't downloaded anything in a long time.
I guess emulators, that's kind of cool, but PSP radio maybe.
I don't know.
I haven't really downloaded any homebrew.
I know, Zaku, you should get the PSP radio thing and the latest firmware, and you can listen to all games radio now on the PSP radio anywhere you go.
Yeah, I already got the latest firmware hacked.
I already got that one.
Actually, Zaku, you reminded me of something, and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but did you see this?
Loki, I'm curious if you saw this.
Sony sent out a poll earlier this week basically asking people, why do you hack the PSP?
Yeah, that's what I heard.
I hack my PSP to give it features that the PSP doesn't otherwise I hack my PSP to steal games Oh man, that's so true
I hack it just to spite you.
How about a couple good websites, Zach, who can keep an eye on?
Because really it's about what you want to do with the PSP.
So how about a couple good websites for Zach?
I guess psbhacks.com, psbupdates.qj.net, stuff like that.
I mean, those would be two websites I'd check.
They have a lot of downloads on there and stuff.
Right.
I just barely had trouble today just getting some proper emulators, you know.
But, you know, at least I know people, you know, like you, Loki, and other folks that can, you know, help me out.
That's good.
You gotta get back on that scene.
I mean, latest M33 is pretty damn good right now.
Especially when your PSP's overclocked.
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go so we can get more calls.
Any quick final thoughts?
Um, get your PSP hacked.
Don't leave, you know, fuck Sony's hindrance.
Alright.
Just know somebody went up in door, but battery, that's all you need to know.
All right.
It's all about the battery.
Take care, buddy.
1-877-GAME-OLR.
I'm hoping our next call will be a little better with the bandwidth because I drop Justin TV a lot in the video.
They're probably just seeing a still picture in there right now.
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, guys.
This is Footy Monster.
See, that's a lot quicker.
Footy Monster is in Argentina, so we might just have to do that every week on Justin TV.
Anyway, sorry.
We're learning about our show live.
What's on your mind, Footy Monster?
No worries at all.
I just wanted to share a couple of things real quick.
First off, congrats on your new home.
Thank you.
We like it.
Hey, quick, DarkSakura, put some of the nice silverware here from all games in your purse.
Okay.
All right.
Sorry.
What's up?
Well, you know that story you had earlier about Brazil and the whole bully thing?
Yes, I do.
Well, here's the thing.
As far as I understand, since it's pretty close from here,
The only country that I know in South America that has any sort of official distribution of anything is actually Chile, and they have Microsoft.
Like, Sony doesn't release anything officially, and Nintendo doesn't release anything officially.
Argentina used to have official distribution of Nintendo products, but that was like in 1995.
So, I'm thinking, and this is just a theory, that anything that happens in Brazil, Rockstar will never care for, because it's not that they're sending their game to Brazil.
because they are not doing it.
It's just retailers importing the game and having a grey market, so to speak.
Um, you know what's interesting though is that it's interesting that Nintendo doesn't support South America more because like I was just kind of noticing, I was just looking at some of the box art on a recent game.
Drew was here last week and he gave me back Super Paper Mario because he borrowed it and I was just kind of eyeing the back of the box and kind of noticing how like it's interesting how Nintendo puts the back of their boxes in three different languages all at once now.
Like you look at the back of a box of a Nintendo game, it's in English, French, and Spanish all in the back.
But you read some of the fine print.
Yes, I was very bored.
It talks about how the game is only for distribution in the United States, Canada, hence the French, and Latin America, they say, hence the Spanish.
Yeah, but Latin America is like Puerto Rico, which is basically the US, and Mexico, which is basically the US.
Well, I think some of our Mexican listeners might disagree, but at the same time, I do find it interesting because then they're basically saying, well, Latin America is just Mexico.
It is kind of interesting that they are cutting off the rest of the countries south of Mexico.
Well, no, not really.
I mean, considering the economies that we have here, it's not that surprising.
I mean, over here, what you have to spend to play a game.
I mean, I was just the other day at the shop buying a 360 game.
Well, attempting to, and it was like 90 US dollars.
So, I'm not gonna go buy a game for that price, so if Nintendo had to officially release their games, support the region, who do you think the prices of games are gonna be?
You know?
And they, I mean, they're not gonna sell at what people here could buy, because they would have no profit.
And even worse, you know, people from the US would import from South America, I mean, it's the same thing, right?
And pay cheaper.
True, true.
It would never work.
I guess that's true.
I guess we had to get the realist perspective.
So in the meantime, how are you getting your games, Footy?
Remind our listeners.
How do you get your games?
Do you just have to pay the markup or do you import or what?
Actually, I got a 360 quite recently.
I had the option of flashing the BIOS like Loki does in one of his 360s and pirate my games but I actually really liked the live experience and I actually bit the bullet and whenever I got to Chile games there are pretty...
They're not cheap, but they're competitive prices with the US.
As in, I could buy Mass Effect for $50, or the other day I found Lost Odyssey for $45.
So, you know, it's like the prices are even, sometimes they're even cheaper.
Like, it got DOA 4 new, sealed, for $20.
So, what I did is just actually go there because I have family there, and whenever I make a trip, I just bring two or three games with me.
because here it's like $100 but over there since Microsoft officially distributes the games it's totally possible to actually buy original games so right now I'm buying original games and just doing it on PS2 I had to buy backups that's all you could do and on my DS I do the same thing
It's very interesting, Footy, to hear you kind of talking openly about pirating games, which, you know, has ruffled some feathers in the past here on this show with some of our listeners who are against pirating, which, you know, I understand.
Let me make this straight.
I do not condone piracy.
But it's interesting, though, Footy, when it's your only option, you know, like you're talking about.
I mean, it's that or smuggle your games from Chile.
Or not play games because, really, I mean, just because you don't have money, your option is not stealing, you know.
I do it because I am fully aware that I'm doing something that's not entirely legal or morally correct.
This is a small anecdote here.
When I was a kid, I used to go to a computer shop to get my computer games in floppy disks, and I would go with my floppy disk that I would buy in a box at a retailer, go there, and look through a list of games and ask them for a game, and I would pay them, and I would go home.
To me, that was totally normal and reasonable.
That was how you got games.
Only later, I understood that that's illegal.
But that was the way you did it here.
So there's another culture of original games here.
I mean, really, there isn't.
so that's part of the problem as well piracy is just so rampant you know that it's like the way it is it's like go to China and say you know with the same argument it will not work I guess it's so interesting to hear from around the world kind of the way things work because sometimes we're in our little bubbles in these other countries we live in so what I love about the internet and doing these podcasts and talking to people from around the world is you get to hear you get to hear from gamers everywhere Footy we got to wrap up and let you go but anything else you want to say to our listeners that's pretty much it guys I guess I'll talk to you later all right good luck Footy take care you too
Smuggles his games from Chile.
Amazing.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
You sound millions light years better.
Hello, Jason.
I know, you sound telephony, probably because he's on the telephone.
He's on the 877, but that's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
I blame Skype.
I blame Vista.
I blame ComCrap and, you know, everything else I can blame.
It's not my fault.
Life is just five.
Don't forget to blame them.
and the RAA.
And the police.
Jason, what's on your mind?
Two short things and one quick thing.
And one longer thing.
Did you know that they made an Impossible Mission remake on the Wii?
Yes, in Europe.
Where is it?
Here.
I want it.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
On my video game shelf.
Come over and play it sometime.
Shut up.
Did you import it from Europe?
No, it was in the, we went to Best Buy, we were checking out, and it was just sitting in those discount bins.
What?
I looked at it, I laughed, I said, I'm getting this, and did, and I've already played it.
Then the game must have come out here, under the radar.
I, yeah, it doesn't have any, it's obviously not Pal, it works on our TV without anything special.
You don't use Freeload or any of that stuff, right?
I didn't look down at the specific branding, but.
Well, shit, I'm going to go pick that up tomorrow then.
All right, cool.
Thanks for the heads up.
I didn't even know it came out here.
That's great.
It's because it didn't.
It did?
It did not.
It only came out on the DS.
Yeah, Impossible Mission DS, $10 on Amazon.
I will go look at the box.
I'll look for more logos.
I will take a picture and show you guys.
I would do it, but it'll...
I completely forgot what the second thing is, so I'll just skip to the last thing.
Farbs is exceedingly intelligent.
Yes, he is.
I was obviously listening to the interview, since I made it back in time to be able to listen to the show, and the discussion along the lines of XNA and WiiWare and everything opening up new opportunities.
It's opening up another avenue for developers of the sort to showcase their talent, but it's not going to be a... It's going to be the same thing with indie and underground games that we already have through a different medium.
It's, you know, the ones that are really good, they will be that one game and then the talent from the studio or just a specific individual is going to be hired onto a big name studio and the cycle is going to continue.
It's a great new avenue, absolutely, but it's not going to fundamentally change the landscape of indie games being easily accessible and open to everybody.
And it was just very interesting to hear somebody else
I mean, go figure.
A developer especially, which is very interesting to hear him say the exact same thoughts that I would have on such a thing.
It's a great thing, but it doesn't change the landscape.
And plus the fact that, you know, he's in another country, too.
So you kind of get, you know, that whole thing I was just talking about with FootyMonster, hearing from gamers around the world, hearing it's still the same idea over there.
Not that there's, you know, obviously all the companies are in Australia doing business.
It's not that radically different from what it is over here in Europe or what have you.
But still interesting that it all comes to that kind of same thought.
I don't know.
Maybe I blew the X and A thing out of proportion a little bit when we first heard about it on the show.
But I still think it's going to be a pretty radical, you know,
It's just like YouTube didn't change the internet completely, but it had a great impact that was felt.
You know what I mean?
People know what YouTube is.
I honestly think XNA is going to be a YouTube of sorts for gaming.
That's kind of how I feel.
Did you play those little community XNA two-week trial games that they had up there?
Yeah, some of them were fun.
Yes, yes, that they were.
It's...
I guess that's true.
and many more.
were yards better than Yaris.
You know what I mean?
They were miles above Yaris.
And some of the other, you know, there's been some other junk on Xbox.
I hate to say it, but the Tron ports weren't all that great.
Like, they could have done better.
And some of the other classic game ports, you know what I mean?
I just think, you know, put it in the hands of the developers, it'd be interesting.
These new games can certainly hold a candle to classic remakes and shit like yours.
Jason, we gotta wrap up here so we can sign off for the night.
It's already midnight 30 on the East Coast.
Do you have any quick final thoughts for us?
I wish I knew what all I wanted to say, but I forgot.
So, good night.
Well, you can always call us next week.
Good night.
Absolutely.
Bye.
Our fearless webmaster, VXJasonXV.
We love him here on the program.
That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
Sorry to those who didn't get through.
We can always try again next week.
We're going to wrap up the show, but first we've got to get to some last minute news.
I'm going to check in with Loki and see if there's any last minute news.
Not really much, but it's kind of interesting.
It looks like there's a hacking group, Blaze Team, that has released a hacked Wii Virtual Console game that they've broken the encryption on.
So that's a whole big old can of worms that Nintendo probably doesn't want opened.
And then there's some other interesting things.
Castle Crashers.
It looks like it's going to have some new characters, including a bear that fights with a fish.
And you also, I guess, get little, I don't know, helper pets or something like that.
And they have a floating cat.
It's kind of funny.
I can't wait for this game to come out.
A floating cat?
Yeah, it's an animal orb.
It's the cat who will add to your agility and strength.
Interesting.
I don't know, it's cute.
RawSteelUT says the ESRB.org lists impossible mission for DS, PS2, PSP, and Wii.
I gotta go look for that.
They have, yeah, Scratchpaw is the cat, which is a cute name for a cat.
Scratchpaw, that is kind of cute.
They also have, there's some other pictures in here.
They have like a little bird and a dog.
and I don't know.
It's just all on devblog.thebehemoth.com and you can check out like they show off the different weapons and stuff.
Was it Barbarian Axe, Fish, they have a Thin Sword, Skinny Sword, Thick Sword, Pumpkin Peeler and different characters for Castle Crashers.
Looks like, well, the Bear and
and then Periwinkle Knight.
And, you know, other than... Man, they're going to have a lot of characters to play as.
That game's going to be fucking awesome.
Can't wait.
That's really it.
Didn't we talk about games for Windows magazines going online only?
Yeah, I think so.
It is.
It's kind of the way magazines are going right now anyway.
Sad to say.
That's...
We're going to wrap up.
We're running pretty long tonight on our first all-game show, but that's all right.
We had a good time.
We had Farbs on the show.
We had lots of folks.
Let's go around to GearBase.
Final thought.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
It's hot in here.
It's getting cooler.
It's cooling down as the night goes on.
Loki, your final thought.
It's hot and humid in here.
My final thought is you guys are babies.
It's not that bad in here.
No, it is getting pretty bad.
Hopefully we get an AC next week.
And, and, and?
And?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
