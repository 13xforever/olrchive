382760	385760	I know, I know, I know, I know
390760	393760	Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
393760	394760	It is the end, guys.
394760	398760	30 minutes before we officially pull the plug on Orange Lounge Radio
398760	401760	and five and a half years of memories on Live 365.
401760	403760	But no tears, no crying, dammit.
403760	405760	There's no crying in internet radio
405760	409260	because the future begins at AllGames.com this Sunday.
409260	411260	The new chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.
411260	413260	But we take a look back at some of the important things
413260	414760	that have happened over the past five years.
414760	416260	And you gotta love this guy.
416260	418760	He was one of the first very accessible people on it.
418760	421260	Oh, actually, we're gonna take a quick little detour here.
421260	422760	Somebody's calling me a little early here.
422760	424760	We're gonna go Skype line.
424760	426760	Hello, are you there?
426760	427760	I'm here.
427760	429760	Hello, how are you, Jamie?
430760	431760	Tired.
431760	433760	Been all day at IKEA.
433760	434760	How was IKEA?
434760	436760	What were you going shopping for at IKEA?
436760	438260	It was Swedish.
438260	439760	It was very Swedish.
439760	441760	Were you going for meatballs or what?
441760	443260	We actually had meatballs.
443260	446760	And then I saw the herring and decided that it was disgusting.
447760	449760	And I bought shelves.
449760	452760	What are you gonna be organizing later?
454260	455760	The computer room.
455760	456760	Fun.
456760	458760	It's a wreck.
459760	460760	Sounds like fun.
460760	461760	It's a freaking wreck.
461760	462760	A freaking wreck.
462760	464760	Well, hey, we're at the end, Jamie.
464760	467760	This is 30 minutes before we pull the plug on the station.
467760	469260	And it's all over.
469260	470760	Are you sad?
470760	471760	No.
471760	472760	No?
474760	476760	Me neither, really.
476760	478760	We have a few people joining us.
478760	480760	The chat is filled up a little bit.
480760	481760	Chat.orangelaundry.com.
481760	483760	We have a handful of people here.
483760	485760	This is really the loyalist we have here tonight.
485760	488760	The people that have been with us through thick and thin, through five and a half years.
488760	493760	Do you have anything you want to say to those people as we say goodbye tonight?
493760	494760	To our listeners?
494760	497760	Yeah.
497760	499760	I like fire.
499760	501760	Always have and always will.
501760	504760	Yeah, I can hang out on the phone for a little while.
504760	505760	All right.
505760	509760	We're going to ignite our flame pit and charge some melon flesh.
509760	510760	Awesome.
510760	511760	Sounds awesome.
511760	515760	Well, hey, since you're on the phone, I'm gonna play a song just for you, okay?
515760	516760	Okay.
516760	517760	All right.
517760	519760	This is a game.
519760	522760	I'm doing things a little bit out of order here, but that's okay, Jamie.
522760	523760	I was gonna play something else.
523760	524760	We'll do this song.
524760	529760	This is a song from a game, and this is a little bit newer, but this is a game that
529760	533760	Jamie has just... She hasn't really shut up about in the past year because she just
533760	535760	loves this game so much.
535760	538760	It's Portal, and you gotta love this song.
538760	540760	Bobby wants me to remind you of this, though.
540760	544760	You know Jonathan Colton, the man who sings this song we're about to play, Still Alive?
544760	549760	You know he also sang a song called Skullcrusher Mountain, which was once in our cage match
549760	550760	like three years ago.
550760	551760	No, not that long ago.
551760	552760	Probably about two years ago.
552760	555760	Yeah, and everybody in chat hated it.
555760	560760	We all hated it, but now he's super famous with this Still Alive.
560760	562760	It's kind of ironic, don't you think?
562760	564760	His other stuff is pretty quirky, too.
564760	565760	It is pretty awesome.
565760	566760	All right, so here it is.
566760	569760	We're gonna play Still Alive for our listeners, and we'll come back and dish a little more
569760	571760	before we say goodbye tonight.
571760	575760	This was a triumph.
575760	580760	I'm making a note here, huge success.
580760	587760	It's hard to upstate my satisfaction.
587760	591760	Aperture Science.
591760	596760	We do what we must, because we can.
596760	601760	For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead.
601760	605760	But there's no sense crying over every mistake.
605760	610760	You just keep on trying till you run above cake.
610760	622760	And the science gets done, and you make a neat come for the people who are still alive.
622760	627760	I'm not even angry.
627760	632760	I'm being so sincere right now.
632760	638760	Even though you broke my heart and killed me.
638760	642760	I'm twirling to pieces.
642760	648760	And through every piece came to a fire.
648760	653760	As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you.
653760	657760	Now these points of data make a beautiful line.
657760	662760	And we're out of beta, we're releasing on time.
662760	675760	So I'm glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned for the people who are still alive.
675760	679760	Go ahead and leave me.
679760	684760	I think I'd prefer to stay inside.
684760	691760	Maybe you'll find someone else to help you.
691760	695760	Maybe Black Mesa.
695760	700760	That was a joke, haha, at chance.
700760	703760	Anyway, this cake is great.
703760	705760	It's so delicious and moist.
705760	709760	Look at me still talking when there's science to do.
709760	715760	When I look up there it makes me glad I'm not you, I've experimented too long.
715760	721760	There is research to be done on the people who are still alive.
721760	725760	Then leave me, I'm still alive.
725760	729760	I'm doing science and I'm still alive.
729760	733760	I feel fantastic and I'm still alive.
733760	737760	While you're dying I'll be still alive.
737760	741760	And when you're dead I will be still alive.
741760	744760	Still alive, still alive.
744760	750760	That's Jonathan Goldin here with Still Alive on OLR, the final little live show.
750760	753760	When we're going to be pulling the plug on OLR in 23 minutes.
753760	756760	Jamie's joining us by phone, you still there Jamie?
756760	758760	Uh, no.
758760	759760	You're half dead.
759760	762760	Hey, you want to hear the latest in the Live 365 drama?
762760	763760	This is hilarious.
763760	764760	Do tell.
764760	768760	I tried to send them a, oh my god, it's so hard to cancel your account with them, right?
768760	773760	So you have to send them an email in order to cancel the account because they have no handy dandy thing on the web.
773760	777760	So I sent them an email like on Monday, hasn't been responded to.
777760	781760	Sent them an email like second request Thursday or Friday, still hasn't been responded to.
781760	785760	So I'm just like great, they're going to try to charge my card tomorrow.
785760	787760	But aha, I'm one step ahead of them.
787760	791760	I'm going to call the bank tomorrow and put a stop pay on anything they try to do.
791760	793760	So things are going to get ugly.
793760	794760	Ha.
794760	799760	Well, you've already paid for the service and they're going to try to do those to just cut it off anyway, right?
799760	800760	Exactly, that's the thing.
800760	804760	I don't have 85 bucks or whatever much they're going to try to charge us for another month.
804760	806760	I don't want to be here another month.
806760	808760	We're ready for the future, dang it.
808760	809760	That's some crap.
809760	812760	I know, it's such crap.
812760	814760	The crap is the best part for it.
814760	818760	How did you put up with this for five years?
818760	820760	Because we were lazy.
820760	821760	Yeah, yeah, something like that.
821760	822760	We're super lazy.
822760	826760	Nothing is as motivating as being forced into it.
826760	827760	True, very true.
827760	831760	I think it's kind of part of the thing we're learning here throughout this transition.
831760	834760	But the future of OLR is going to be very exciting.
834760	837760	You know I got to play with the All Great Game stream yesterday.
837760	839760	I got to hijack it for a little bit.
839760	840760	It was lots of fun.
840760	841760	The quality is really good.
841760	844760	I think it's going to be a good time.
844760	846760	Well, I've got news.
846760	848760	What's that?
848760	854760	They brought up a blog for that Street Fighter movie.
854760	861760	Well, the blog was overloaded because of a lot of heavy web traffic.
861760	863760	But they've got it back up now.
863760	866760	It's at streetfightermovie.net.
866760	867760	Interesting.
867760	874760	Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li, which means I'm not going to watch it because she's my least favorite character.
874760	876760	I'll watch it if Kylie's in it.
876760	880760	Even if she has a cameo or is on the soundtrack, I'll still watch it.
880760	881760	Yeah.
881760	882760	It'll be awesome.
882760	884760	I'm sure we'll talk more about that on Tomorrow Night Show.
884760	888760	Also on Tomorrow Night Show, I just taped it not even 20 minutes ago.
888760	891760	It's the reason why we started a little bit after 7 tonight.
891760	896760	Farbs, the man who wrote Romcheck Fail is going to be on Tomorrow Night Show.
896760	897760	It's going to be good times.
897760	898760	Good times.
898760	903760	And I played a whole lot of Romcheck Fail today because I had to do research for the interview.
903760	905760	So it'll be good times.
905760	908760	Alright, hey, we've got to squeeze in a bunch more songs.
908760	912760	Everybody is wondering what the last song is that's ever going to be played on O.L.R.
912760	915760	And Jamie, I hate to tell you, I've already picked it out and there's nothing you can do about it.
915760	916760	I've already picked out the-
916760	917760	I thought that-
917760	918760	What?
918760	921760	I thought we were going to do the one that we discussed because I found it.
921760	923760	Oh, no, no, that'll be the next to last song.
923760	927760	But then it occurred to me that there really is only one song we can go out with.
927760	929760	There's really only one song.
929760	931760	But that'll be the next to last song.
931760	932760	Okay.
932760	933760	Alright.
933760	935760	See, even I'm keeping Jamie in suspense here.
935760	936760	But you will approve.
936760	937760	Trust me, you'll approve.
937760	938760	I will?
938760	939760	Yes, you will.
939760	940760	Will you tell me out there?
940760	942760	You better or I'm going to stick you with a spork.
942760	945760	Yeah, if you join chat or something, I'll tell you.
945760	946760	Okay.
946760	947760	Alright.
947760	948760	Hey-
948760	950760	I actually don't have IRC on this computer yet.
950760	951760	Dang you.
951760	952760	Go to chat.
952760	953760	I'm going to download it.
953760	955760	Go to chat.orangehondrena.com, silly pants.
955760	956760	I hate that client.
956760	957760	Alright.
957760	960760	Hey, we're going to play another song here.
960760	962760	We're going to play some remixes here in this break.
962760	968760	And one person we came to know and love during the OLR run on Live at 365 was Midi Head,
968760	971760	like the first accessible DDR artist to all of us.
971760	975760	He actually came on the show and did an interview and he was a lot of fun.
975760	977760	So we're going to play one of his remixes right now.
977760	981760	It's Midi Head's smack mix of Jelly Kiss.
981760	984760	We'll be back with more at the end.
984760	1013760	See you on OLR.
1014760	1043760	Bye.
1043760	1072760	Bye.
1072760	1090760	Jerry Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1090760	1095760	Hey, you know, one of the first big whoopty-doo deal shows we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio.
1095760	1100640	Do you remember when we got to premiere a brand new DDR song before anybody else did
1100640	1101640	Dark Sakura?
1101640	1102640	Yeah.
1102640	1106640	And I'm thinking not even like we did it for some of the Xbox games a couple of years ago,
1106640	1111640	but even way, way, way before that because we had buddies at Konami.
1111640	1114640	We got to premiere the DDR version of Your Rain.
1114640	1115640	You remember that?
1115640	1116640	Yeah, I do.
1116640	1117640	It was huge.
1117640	1119640	We actually got some longtime listeners out of that one night.
1119640	1120640	It was a huge night for us.
1120640	1123640	So I thought maybe we could tip our hat and play that song.
1123640	1126640	Even though you hate this remix, Jamie, it's an important part of OLR history.
1126640	1128640	So I think we got to play it.
1128640	1135640	Here it is.
1135640	1156640	Here it is.
1156640	1180640	Here it is.
1180640	1200640	Here it is.
1200640	1222640	I will never forget how we teased everybody with like little bits and pieces and clips
1222640	1224640	of that song for like three hours.
1224640	1228640	And people actually stayed to hear the whole damn thing because they're awesome.
1228640	1229640	I know.
1229640	1230640	That was really cool.
1230640	1231640	That was an awesome night.
1231640	1235640	You know, we got to figure out a way to get the old shows to the fans because we have
1235640	1236640	people.
1236640	1238640	I mean, I got to say, I get emails from Misty all the time.
1238640	1240640	You got to let out the old shows.
1240640	1242640	I don't even know if we have all the old shows.
1242640	1243640	Some of them are like long gone.
1243640	1247640	I know there's at least one episode that got botched archive or something that's never
1247640	1249640	coming back, but a pretty good chunk of them.
1249640	1252640	We're going to have to get some DVDs out there in the next year or something now that we
1252640	1256640	have time since we're not managing a station 24-7 anymore.
1256640	1260640	Well, hey, guess who's in chat?
1260640	1261640	Hey, you're in chat.
1261640	1265640	Hey, then you can see everybody there, chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
1265640	1270640	Hey, while you say hello to people in chat, I thought since Loki's not on the phone tonight,
1270640	1272640	we need to tip our hat at the one and only Loki somehow.
1272640	1278640	Little known fact about Loki, he actually was not a full-time show host when the show
1278640	1279640	started.
1279640	1281640	He did not join full-time until episode 20.
1281640	1285640	And Jamie and I made the decision to anoint him as a host of the program because, well,
1285640	1286640	he just never went away.
1286640	1290640	I mean, he came to every single program, but he was very passionate and obviously has done
1290640	1294640	a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of great work for OLR over the years and is just as
1294640	1296640	much a part of the station as the rest of us.
1296640	1300640	So I got to play a Loki remix because he's a very talented remixer.
1300640	1303640	This is probably one of the most famous remixes he did over the years.
1303640	1304640	So you ready for this?
1304640	1310640	This is Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix by Loki and Verbilicious.
1310640	1313640	Oh, then don't answer your iPhone when you hear this, Jamie.
1313640	1315640	Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.
1343640	1352640	Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.
1373640	1393640	Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.
1403640	1427640	Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.
1427640	1451640	Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.
1451640	1471640	Don't Play Nice, by Loki and Verbilicious.
1471640	1487640	Loki versus Verbilicious with Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix.
1487640	1490640	Eleven minutes until the plug gets pulled.
1490640	1492640	We don't have a lot of time, but hey, you know,
1492640	1497640	Orange Launch Radio started as a, you know, DDR, 2DX, BeatMania, Parappa,
1497640	1499640	you know, all those music games.
1499640	1501640	You started as a station like that.
1501640	1503640	We all came together, DarkSakura, myself, and Loki.
1503640	1506640	We all met playing DDR at the local arcade.
1506640	1509640	I mean, literally, that is how Orange Launch Radio started.
1509640	1512640	Do you remember the first time we met DarkSakura?
1512640	1517640	I do, actually. Wasn't it over in Milpitas?
1517640	1522640	It was. It was the day we all went to go play Para Para Paradise together.
1522640	1525640	Yeah, and so Siege was there and doing his thing.
1525640	1528640	That's right. Raven to the beat.
1528640	1537640	Jamie, what would you say is your favorite DDR song of all freaking time?
1537640	1540640	I'd have to actually say the Brilliant to You OG.
1540640	1543640	Brilliant to You OG. Shit, I had something else queued up.
1543640	1547640	That's all right. I can find it. I know I have it.
1547640	1551640	Honestly, that's been my favorite DDR song since, like, the very beginning.
1551640	1555640	What is it about Brilliant to You OG that makes it your very fav?
1555640	1558640	Because I'm going to do a block here of the host's favorite DDR song,
1558640	1560640	because I know Loki's, and I'll play mine too.
1560640	1562640	Tell me what you did have for me.
1562640	1564640	I had Love by Sonic Dream.
1564640	1570640	Actually, no. I love, I adore that song, but it wasn't my favorite DDR song.
1570640	1573640	That's all good. I think I have OG remixed queued up somewhere here.
1573640	1576640	I just got to dig for it a little bit. Not a problem.
1576640	1579640	I just thought that it was different, you know?
1579640	1583640	I thought that I liked the mix itself, and the steps were a lot of fun.
1583640	1585640	That's true. It was a lot of fun.
1585640	1587640	Definitely one of the first Carter songs I've done.
1587640	1590640	Oh my gosh, I do not have B4U Orchestral Groove. How is that?
1590640	1594640	I have, like, the entire DDR Freak Radio playlist from back in the day,
1594640	1597640	and somehow I don't have B4U Orchestral Groove.
1597640	1598640	Well, let me see.
1598640	1599640	How is that?
1599640	1601640	I have it.
1601640	1604640	I might have it. You know, I have the third mix.
1604640	1606640	Wasn't it on third mix?
1606640	1609640	I have it.
1609640	1612640	I'm looking in my portable drive now.
1612640	1617640	Okay, then we'll do mine and Loki's first while we dig for that,
1617640	1618640	so we don't have a lot of time.
1618640	1620640	I wouldn't expect you playing Love.
1620640	1624640	Alright, then we might play Love, just in the interest of time,
1624640	1627640	and everyone will just know for the record that Rob screwed up.
1627640	1631640	Hey, what better way to end OLR than me screwing up?
1631640	1634640	Here it is, Love by Sonic Dream.
1634640	1643640	One of Jamie's favorite DDR songs. One of them.
1664640	1678640	You're like a dream come true, I feel so beautiful.
1678640	1685640	And heart and style is all those of you.
1685640	1688640	Love, I've just got to have it.
1688640	1691640	I believe in love.
1691640	1694140	I can't be without it
1694140	1697640	Come to me and make your confession
1697640	1700640	Love, come let it go
1700640	1705140	Love, like it's got a habit I believe in
1705140	1709140	Love, I can't be without it
1709140	1712640	Come to me and make your confession
1712640	1716640	Love, come let it go
1716640	1721640	Here comes my favorite DDR song of all time and it's from a home version
1746640	1753640	Love, like it's got a habit

1922140	1926140	Alright it's almost that time
1926140	1929140	We're like four minutes from the end or about five minutes
1929140	1930140	I might go a little bit over but
1930140	1933140	Jamie it's just about over
1933140	1935140	I don't know what else to say
1935140	1936140	What Jamie?
1936140	1937140	I just said yeah
1937140	1939140	Oh okay I thought you said Rob
1939140	1942140	I thought you were going to do the Rob Rob Rob thing
1942140	1943140	Rob
1943140	1944140	What?
1944140	1945140	No
1945140	1946140	Alright
1946140	1947140	Well we
1947140	1948140	What?
1948140	1949140	No
1949140	1950140	Alright
1950140	1951140	We promise
1951140	1952140	I hate you
1952140	1954140	I hate you so much
1954140	1956140	What?
1956140	1957140	Hi
1957140	1958140	Hi
1958140	1960140	You know what Jamie?
1960140	1962140	It's time for you to get the F out
1962140	1964140	Of Live 365
1964140	1967140	No we swore that this was going to be our last song
1967140	1969140	And it's not
1969140	1971140	It's actually our next to last song in Live 365
1971140	1975140	But it's very fitting for the end of Orange Lounge Radio
1975140	1978140	It's 2 Live Crew with one of their classics
1978140	1981140	So anything else you want to say about this song Jamie?
1984140	1988140	I have memories of this song from my freshman year of high school
1988140	1989140	I'll play it that way
1989140	1990140	Awesome
1990140	1993140	And we dedicate this to all the OLR listeners
1993140	1996140	Who have stuck with us for five years
1996140	1998140	Through thick and thin right?
1998140	2000140	We dedicate it to all of you
2000140	2003140	And hope you'll be able to recover from the message in this song
2003140	2005140	Here it is, 2 Live Crew
2005140	2009140	It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out

2213640	2227640	Catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch, catch
2257640	2284000	Well guys, here it is.
2284000	2285000	The end.
2285000	2286000	This is it.
2286000	2287000	It's eight o'clock.
2287000	2288760	It's time to pull the plug.
2288760	2292840	It's time to say goodbye to the station we started five and a half years ago.
2292840	2293840	It's time to say hello to the future.
2293840	2294840	Can we set it on fire?
2294840	2295840	Huh?
2295840	2296840	We're still here.
2296840	2297840	What?
2297840	2298840	Can we set it on fire?
2298840	2299840	Can we set the station on fire?
2299840	2300840	God damn I wish.
2300840	2303120	But no, what we're going to be doing, the reason why we're pulling the plug at eight
2303120	2304120	is that we want to be cleared out.
2304120	2308680	We want to be moved out by 9 Eastern and that means we're going to be purging everything
2308680	2312000	from the archives because we don't want Live 365 to continue to operate our station as
2312000	2313680	a VIP only thing.
2313680	2318160	Everything is going to be completely wiped and officially we've merged with AllGames.com
2318160	2323480	but you know I must say I'm going to miss being the overlord of my own radio station
2323480	2324480	with my friends.
2324480	2326540	You know, getting to take over the stream randomly.
2326540	2328400	No more random bursts of Abba.
2328400	2331920	It's kind of going to be sad but what can you do?
2331920	2333920	That's what Justin TV swore right?
2333920	2334920	Yep.
2334920	2337920	And then of course you know, you never know, we might be able to twist Bobby's arm enough
2337920	2342440	and maybe we get something special over at AllGames like a very fucked up Christmas from
2342440	2343800	Jamie and Rob or something like that.
2343800	2344800	You never know.
2344800	2345800	So.
2345800	2346800	So.
2346800	2347800	That would be fun.
2347800	2352500	I'm sorry, the chat was correct to me, it's supposed to be 9 Pacific which would be Midnight
2352500	2353500	Eastern.
2353500	2356720	I want to be moved out by Midnight Eastern which is only about an hour away and I have
2356720	2357720	dinner planned.
2357720	2358780	So this is it.
2358780	2359780	The last song.
2359780	2363600	I'm going to introduce it here in just a moment but Jamie, do you have any last things you
2363600	2365200	want to say?
2365200	2369440	Um, a couple things.
2369440	2370440	Sure.
2370440	2378680	Number one, Live 365, thank you for giving in to the whole RIAA scare tactic bullshit
2378680	2379680	going on.
2379680	2382000	That's the number one thing.
2382000	2392960	Number two, I really like hamburgers and number three, cinnamon buns from Ikea are really
2392960	2397400	really really tasty and smell really really really good but they're really really bad
2397400	2398400	for you.
2398400	2403840	And the very final thing is reject false icons.
2403840	2404840	Of course.
2404840	2405840	I have to name a new one.
2405840	2407320	This has been my catchphrase for life.
2407320	2408320	Okay.
2408320	2411280	Nothing changes until you make a change.
2411280	2412480	That is true.
2412480	2413480	Very true.
2413480	2414760	And now we're making a change.
2414760	2419320	We're going to change tomorrow is when it all starts.
2419320	2420320	This is kind of sad.
2420320	2421320	It's a sad moment.
2421320	2423640	It's happy and it's sad, you know what I mean?
2423640	2427080	Like I feel bad for all the folks that have really supported us over five and a half years
2427080	2428520	of internet radio.
2428520	2433740	I know the show, the music and all that stuff is going away, but you know, obviously the
2433740	2434960	show is still going to be there.
2434960	2435960	We're still going to be there.
2435960	2437240	The community is still going to be there.
2437240	2439280	The oil army is still going to be there.
2439280	2442680	Nothing is really going away except our stream.
2442680	2445920	And as we merge into Voltron, what's that?
2445920	2447280	We're starting over.
2447280	2451080	We are starting over indeed, truer words.
2451080	2452400	So that's it.
2452400	2455200	I just want to say thank you to everybody in chat right now.
2455200	2458600	Everybody who couldn't be here tonight, but wanted to be everybody that supported us for
2458600	2459600	five and a half years.
2459600	2462360	And please continue to support us in the future.
2462360	2467400	That's going to bring us to the last song and Jamie, do you want me to hang up or just
2467400	2469040	keep you on through this?
2469040	2470040	I'll stay on.
2470040	2471040	Okay.
2471040	2472040	This is what's going to happen folks.
2472040	2475840	I'm going to play the last song, which you know, after thinking long and hard, we wanted
2475840	2481680	to pick one song that really just encompassed everything that Orange Lounge Radio in the
2481680	2482680	past five and a half years.
2482680	2486080	If you could just sum it up into one song, this is it.
2486080	2488680	So we're going to play this and then that's it.
2488680	2492720	You're going to hear silence and then you're going to hear the stream get cut and that's
2492720	2493840	the end.
2493840	2496600	So that's it.
2496600	2499120	Any last, last, last things, Jamie, because this is really it.
2499120	2500640	We're not saying anything after the song.
2500640	2501640	It's over.
2501640	2503600	The plug's getting pulled.
2503600	2511360	I guess I hope you all have been listening to.
2511360	2512360	Absolutely.
2512360	2518280	You know that Herring Row I was talking about earlier?
2518280	2520280	The brand is ABBA.
2520280	2521280	Awesome.
2521280	2522280	All right.
2522280	2525520	So you have candidates, that's us.
2525520	2528600	You will keep going on with randomness as long as I let you.
2528600	2529600	Yes I will.
2529600	2530600	Okay.
2530600	2531600	Play the damn song.
2531600	2532600	All right.
2532600	2534080	Group hug and chat everybody.
2534080	2535080	Here it is.
2535080	2537140	The last song and then the plug getting pulled.
2537140	2540520	Thank you for myself, Dark Sakura, Loki, everybody.
2540520	2544020	Thank you for your support of Orange Lounge Radio.
2544020	2545240	We are starting over.
2545240	2547480	We'll see you tomorrow night at AllGames.com.
2547480	2572000	Good night everybody.
2577480	2605480	Good night.
2605480	2633960	Good night.
