22335	25897	Thanks to all who have supported us in our five and a half years of broadcasting.
26237	30060	On April 13th, please join us in our future projects at our new home.
36417	36657	Live365.com
103186	104235	Like a shooting star
390765	393266	Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
393847	394807	It is the end, guys.
395127	401591	30 minutes before we officially pull the plug on Orange Lounge Radio and five and a half years of memories on Live 365.
401671	403592	But no tears, no crying, damn it.
403612	405493	There's no crying in internet radio.
406013	409174	because the future begins at allgames.com this Sunday.
409574	411155	The new chapter of Orange Lounge Radio.
411175	414376	But we take a look back at some of the important things that have happened over the past five years.
414856	415936	And you've got to love this guy.
416316	421398	He was one of the first very accessible people on... Oh, actually, we're going to take a quick little detour here.
421438	422718	Somebody's calling me a little early here.
422738	423538	We're going to go sky blind.
425099	426159	Hello, are you there?
427219	427599	I'm here.
427839	429260	Hello, how are you, Jamie?
431080	431341	Tired.
431741	432561	Been all day at Ikea.
433981	434921	How was Ikea?
434961	436602	What were you going shopping for at Ikea?
437123	437903	It was Swedish.
438564	439644	It was very Swedish?
439684	441125	Were you going for meatballs or what?
441926	445929	We actually had meatballs and then I saw the herring and decided that it was disgusting.
447730	450372	And I bought shelves.
450692	452533	What are you going to be organizing later?
454274	455175	The computer room.
455855	456175	Fun.
456836	457436	It's a wreck.
459778	460298	Sounds like fun.
460438	461259	It's a freaking wreck.
461721	470032	a freaking wreck well hey we're at the end Jamie this is 30 minutes before we pull the plug on the station and it's all over are you sad?
471354	471514	no
475222	476202	Me neither, really.
476923	478383	We have a few people joining us.
478944	482025	The chat is filled up a little bit, chat.orangelandrady.com.
482045	483345	We have a handful of people here.
483766	488628	This is really the loyalists we have here tonight, the people that have been with us through thick and thin, through five and a half years.
488988	493069	Do you have anything you want to say to those people as we say goodbye tonight?
493830	494450	To our listeners?
494770	496331	Yeah.
497811	498452	I like fire.
500172	501293	Always have and always will.
502386	505014	Yeah, I can hang out on the phone for a little while.
505334	510008	All right, sounds... We're going to ignite our flame pit and char some malum flush.
510643	511103	Awesome.
511223	511864	Sounds awesome.
511884	516166	Well, hey, since you're on the phone, I'm going to play a song just for you, okay?
516907	517327	Okay.
517427	517727	All right.
517767	519468	This is a game.
519488	522350	I'm doing things a little bit out of order here, but that's okay, Jamie.
522790	524211	I was going to play something else.
524231	524852	We'll do this song.
525232	536679	This is a song from a game, and this is a little bit newer, but this is a game that Jamie is just â€“ she hasn't really shut up about in the past year because she just loves this game so much, and it's Portal.
536699	537019	Portal.
537830	538790	His other stuff is pretty quirky too.
564929	568111	This was a triumph I'm making a note here, huge success It's hard to overstate my satisfaction Aperture science
591738	612349	We do what we must because we can For the good of all of us Except the ones who are dead But there's no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying till you run out of cake And the science gets done
627950	657431	I'm being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me And tore me to pieces And blew every piece into a pile As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you Now these points of data make a beautiful
660132	665474	I think I'd prefer to stay inside Maybe you'll find someone else to help
695942	696963	What was the joke?
696983	699666	Haha, bad chance.
701008	705753	Anyway, this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist.
706134	710078	Look at me, still talking when there's science to do.
710098	713803	When I look up there it makes me glad I'm not you.
713923	716566	I've experimented too long, there is
745148	753879	That's Jonathan Coulton here with Still Alive on OLR, the final little live show when we're going to be pulling the plug on OLR in 23 minutes.
753979	755220	Jamie's joining us by phone.
755240	756061	You still there, Jamie?
757984	758124	No.
758865	759506	You're half dead.
759726	762529	Hey, you want to hear the latest in the Live 365 drama?
762569	763390	This is hilarious.
764963	766364	I tried to send them an account.
766564	769386	Oh my god, it's so hard to cancel your account with them, right?
769466	774190	So you have to send them an email in order to cancel the account because they have no handy dandy thing on the web.
774530	777953	So I sent them an email like on Monday, hasn't been responded to.
778393	782376	Sent them an email like second request Thursday or Friday, still hasn't been responded to.
782757	784198	So I'm just like, great.
784338	787981	They're going to try to charge my card tomorrow, but aha, I'm one step ahead of them.
788101	791624	I'm going to call the bank tomorrow and put a stop pay on anything they try to do.
791764	792925	So things are going to get ugly.
795060	799442	Well, you've already paid for the service, and if you're going to try to do those, you should just cut it off anyway, right?
799602	800683	Exactly, that's the thing.
800903	804505	I don't have 85 bucks or whatever much they're going to try to charge us for another month.
804945	806626	I don't want to be here another month.
806646	808467	We're ready for the future, dang it.
809048	810048	That's so crap.
810268	811289	I know, it's such crap.
812810	814571	The crap is the best word for it.
815011	817673	How did we put up with this for five years?
818973	820314	Because we were lazy.
820754	822015	Yeah, yeah, something like that.
822115	822816	We're super lazy.
822836	823216	Nothing is...
823757	826398	Nothing is as motivating as being forced into it.
826798	827818	True, very true.
827858	831559	I think it's kind of part of the thing we're learning here throughout this transition.
831599	834280	But the future of OLR is going to be very exciting.
834540	837341	You know, I got to play with the all-grit game stream yesterday.
837921	839282	I got to hijack it for a little bit.
839322	840062	It was lots of fun.
840102	841162	The quality is really good.
841222	842603	I think it's going to be a good time.
844223	846304	Well, I've got news.
846624	846984	What's that?
848385	852466	They've brought up a blog for that Street Fighter movie.
852766	852986	Mm-hmm.
854780	860363	Well, the blog was, I guess, overloaded because of a lot of heavy web traffic.
861443	863344	But they've got it back up now.
863484	865565	It's at streetfightermovie.net.
866586	867126	Interesting.
867726	872108	Street Fighter, The Legend of Chun-Li, which means I'm not going to watch it because she's my least favorite character.
874649	875990	I'll watch it if Kylie's in it.
876310	876550	I know.
877431	880212	Even if she has a cameo or is on the soundtrack, I'll still watch it.
881317	881557	Yeah.
881737	882398	It'd be awesome.
882618	884479	I'm sure we'll talk more about that on tomorrow night's show.
884639	888721	Also on tomorrow night's show, I just taped it not even 20 minutes ago.
888761	891082	It's the reason why we started a little bit after 7 tonight.
892162	895784	Farbs, the man who wrote Rom Check Fail is going to be on tomorrow night's show.
896789	900891	I thought we were going to do the one that we discussed because I found it
922495	924556	Oh, no, no, that'll be the next to last song.
924596	928037	But then it occurred to me that there really is only one song we can go out with.
928457	929717	There's really only one song.
930158	931658	But that'll be the next to last song.
932758	933059	Okay.
933399	933699	All right.
934479	937060	See, even I'm keeping Jamie in suspense here, but you will approve.
937380	938220	Trust me, you'll approve.
938360	938701	I will?
939041	939581	Yes, you will.
939941	940981	Will you tell me off air?
941241	941742	You better.
941782	943302	I'm going to stick you with a spork.
943822	945463	Yeah, if you join chat or something, I'll tell you.
946443	946743	Okay.
946903	947143	All right.
947844	950404	I actually don't have IRC on this computer yet.
950845	951385	Dang you.
952443	955185	I'm going to download it I hate that client I'm downloading it
973533	976077	He actually came on the show and did an interview and he was a lot of fun.
976097	978480	So we're going to play one of his remixes right now.
978560	982306	It's Middyhead's smack mix of Jelly Kiss.
982786	985150	We'll be back with more at the end.
985670	986351	We don't know a lot.
1087694	1090716	Jerry Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1090996	1101463	Hey, you know, one of the first big whoop-dee-doo deal shows we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio, do you remember when we got to premiere a brand new DDR song before anybody else did, DarkSakura?
1101883	1102904	Yeah, I do.
1102944	1115132	Yeah, it was, and I'm thinking not even like, we did it for some of the Xbox games a couple years ago, but even way, way, way before that, because we had buddies at Konami, we got to premiere the DDR version of Your Rain, you remember that?
1115152	1115412	Yeah.
1116075	1116555	Yeah, I do.
1116575	1116895	That it is.
1218750	1228036	I will never forget how we teased everybody with like little bits and pieces and clips of that song for like three hours and people actually stayed to hear the whole damn thing because they're awesome.
1229471	1230551	I know, that was really cool
1261001	1261921	Hey, you're in chat.
1261941	1265903	Hey, then you can see everybody there, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
1266224	1273028	Hey, while you say hello to people in chat, I thought since Loki's not on the phone tonight, we need to tip our hat at the one and only Loki somehow.
1273348	1278851	Little known fact about Loki, he actually was not a full-time show host when the show started.
1279271	1285275	He did not join full-time until episode 20, and Jamie and I made the decision to anoint him as a host of the program because...
1285695	1286876	Well, he just never went away.
1287076	1297239	I mean, he came to every single program, but he was very passionate and obviously has done a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of great work for OLR over the years and is just as much a part of the station as the rest of us.
1297300	1301081	So I got to play a Loki remix because he's a very talented remixer.
1301441	1304142	This is probably one of the most famous remixes he did over the years.
1304162	1304862	So you ready for this?
1305383	1311205	This is Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac Mix by Loki and Verbilicious.
1311505	1313966	Ooh, then don't answer your iPhone when you hear this, Jamie.
1384603	1387035	Checking if the DJ's hot, I'm just chillin'
1427469	1428569	Yeah, let's switch it up.
1484275	1488317	Loki versus Verbalicious with Don't Play Nice, the Zodiac mix.
1489237	1490917	11 minutes till the plug gets pulled.
1491158	1499581	We don't have a lot of time, but hey, you know, Orange Lounge Radio started as a, you know, DDR, 2DX, Beatmania, Parappa, you know, all those music games.
1499601	1500861	We started as a station like that.
1501301	1503822	We all came together, DarkSakura, myself, and Loki.
1503842	1506423	We all met playing DDR at the local arcade.
1506463	1509424	I mean, literally, that is how Orange Lounge Radio started.
1509444	1511105	Do you remember the first time we met, DarkSakura?
1512927	1513888	I do, actually.
1513928	1518250	Wasn't it over in Milpitas?
1518550	1518770	It was.
1519070	1522352	It was the day we all went to go play Para Para Paradise together.
1523273	1525534	Yeah, and so Siege was there and doing his thing.
1525694	1528075	That's right, raving to the beat.
1528336	1532238	Well, Jamie, what would you say is your favorite DDR song of all freaking time?
1537481	1539622	I'd have to actually say the brilliant T.O.G.,
1540959	1542579	Brilliant2U OG.
1542659	1543860	Shit, I had something else queued up.
1543880	1544280	That's alright.
1546680	1547280	I can find it.
1547320	1551101	I know I have it.
1551301	1555742	What is it about Brilliant2U OG that makes it your very fave?
1556082	1560683	Because I'm going to do a block here of the host's favorite DDR song because I know Loki's and I'll play mine too.
1560943	1562143	I had Love by Sonic Dream.
1565982	1567043	Actually, no.
1567743	1570845	I love, I adore that song, but it wasn't my favorite DDR song.
1571085	1571725	That's all good.
1571765	1573766	I think I have OG Remix queued up somewhere here.
1573786	1575027	I just gotta dig for it a little bit.
1575767	1576428	Not a problem.
1576788	1579949	I just thought that it was different, you know.
1579969	1583131	I thought that I liked the mix itself, and the steps were a lot of fun.
1584272	1584692	That's true.
1584712	1585132	It was a lot of fun.
1585152	1586513	That's one of the first harder songs I've done.
1587788	1590509	Oh my gosh, I do not have B4U Orchestra Groove.
1590529	1591050	How is that?
1591090	1596933	I have, like, the entire DDR Freak Radio playlist from back in the day, and somehow I don't have B4U Orchestra Groove.
1598013	1598674	Well, let me see.
1598914	1599474	How is that?
1600795	1601375	I have it.
1602356	1602876	I might have it.
1602896	1603977	You know, I have the third mix.
1605998	1606938	Wasn't it on third mix?
1608499	1609920	Good money, DDR...
1610919	1612720	I'm looking in my portable drive now.
1613041	1618805	Okay, then we'll do mine and Loki's first while we dig for that so we don't have a lot of time.
1618825	1620286	I wouldn't object to you playing Love.
1621046	1627331	Alright, then we might play Love just in the interest of time and everyone will just know for the record that Rob screwed up.
1627391	1630613	Hey, what better way to end OLR than me screwing up?
1632595	1634496	Here it is, Love by Sonic Dream.
1634956	1636637	One of Jamie's favorite DDR songs.
1636858	1637158	One of them.
1642374	1643282	I believe in
1716673	1719951	Here comes my favorite DDR song of all time and it's from a home version.
1823766	1830017	And I'm pretty sure this song is Matt's favorite DDR song.
1923715	1925937	Alright, it's almost that time.
1926437	1928719	We're like four minutes from the end, or about five minutes.
1928739	1932483	I'm going to go a little bit over, but Jamie, it's just about over.
1933403	1934344	I don't know what else to say.
1935125	1935545	What, Jamie?
1936506	1937207	I just said yeah.
1937687	1938067	Oh, okay.
1938147	1938908	I thought you said Rob.
1938928	1940830	I thought you were going to do the Rob, Rob, Rob thing.
1942091	1942351	Rob.
1942891	1943112	What?
1944593	1944813	No.
1945053	1945294	Alright.
1946434	1947876	Well, we... What?
1949037	1949137	No.
1949505	1949745	All right.
1950066	1950927	We promise.
1951547	1952068	I hate you.
1952308	1953369	I hate you so much.
1955031	1956232	What?
1956953	1957193	Hi.
1957474	1957674	Hi.
1958875	1959696	You know what, Jamie?
1959956	1962659	It's time for you to get the F out of Life 365.
1964713	1969058	No, we swore that this was going to be our last song, and it's not.
1969118	1975045	It's actually our next-to-last song in Live Through CC5, but it's very fitting for the end of Orange Lounge Radio.
1975866	1978008	It's 2 Live Crew with one of their classics.
1978589	1979050	So, here it is.
1979090	1980491	Anything else you want to say about this song, Jamie?
1981813	1984436	I were just...
1985052	1988094	I have memories of this song from my freshman year of high school.
1988114	1988874	I'll put it that way.
1989115	1989475	Awesome.
1989995	1997680	And we dedicate this to all the OLR listeners who have stuck with us for five years through thick and thin, right?
1997700	2003043	We dedicate it to all of you and hope you'll be able to recover from the message in this song.
2004003	2005044	Here it is, 2 Life Crew.
2005684	2010967	It's my house, and if you don't like it, get the fuck out.
2011128	2013109	It's my house.
2014312	2014414	Go!
2169120	2170245	If you like it, get the fuck out!
2277113	2278995	Get the fuck out my house!
2279055	2280516	You missed me, bitch!
2297779	2298600	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2320836	2321577	That would be fun.
2349372	2350433	Sorry, the chat was correct to me.
2350473	2352874	It's supposed to be 9 Pacific, which would be midnight Eastern.
2352894	2357417	I want to be moved out by midnight Eastern, which is only about an hour away, and I have dinner planned.
2357477	2359658	So this is it, the last song.
2359678	2361599	I'm going to introduce it here in just a moment.
2361679	2364101	But Jamie, do you have any last things you want to say?
2366062	2369063	A couple things.
2369404	2369604	Sure.
2370984	2374727	Number one, Live365, fuck you for giving in to the...
2375578	2379240	whole RIAA scare tactic bullshit going on.
2379800	2380741	That's the number one thing.
2381821	2385824	Number two, I really like hamburgers.
2387845	2397710	And number three, cinnamon buns from Ikea are really, really, really tasty and smell really, really, really good, but they're really, really bad for you.
2398510	2403393	And the very final thing is reject false icons.
2404147	2405509	I have something, a new one.
2405529	2407091	This has been my catchphrase for life.
2407251	2407511	Okay.
2408693	2410476	Nothing changes until you make it change.
2411197	2411777	That is true.
2412358	2412859	Very true.
2412999	2414121	And now we're making it change.
2414704	2417506	We're going to change tomorrow is when it all starts.
2419267	2420228	This is kind of sad.
2420288	2421489	It's a sad moment.
2421709	2422910	It's happy and it's sad.
2422970	2423530	You know what I mean?
2423630	2428073	I feel bad for all the folks that have really supported us over five and a half years of internet radio.
2428594	2434818	I know the music and all that stuff is going away, but obviously the show is still going to be there.
2434878	2435739	We're still going to be there.
2435779	2437200	The community is still going to be there.
2437260	2438581	The Oil Army is still going to be there.
2439061	2441983	Nothing is really going away except our stream.
2442784	2443244	Hey, Rob.
2444585	2444885	What's that?
2445845	2447406	We're starting over.
2447727	2448827	We are starting over.
2449308	2449728	Indeed.
2449748	2450488	True words.
2451029	2452409	So that's it.
2452489	2454871	I just want to say thank you to everybody in chat right now.
2454951	2456772	Everybody who couldn't be here tonight but wanted to be.
2457572	2461355	Everybody that supported us for five and a half years and please continue to support us in the future.
2462195	2463856	That's going to bring us to the last song.
2464697	2468179	And Jamie, do you want me to hang up or just keep you on through this?
2469156	2469676	I'll stay on.
2469776	2469996	Okay.
2470697	2471837	This is what's going to happen, folks.
2471897	2482782	I'm going to play the last song, which, you know, after thinking long and hard, we wanted to pick one song that really just encompassed everything that Orange Lounge Radio in the past five and a half years.
2482922	2485624	If you could just sum it up into one song, this is it.
2486024	2488465	So we're going to play this, and then that's it.
2488605	2493167	You're going to hear silence, and then you're going to hear the stream get cut, and that's the end.
2493787	2493967	So...
2495359	2495839	That's it.
2496519	2498200	Any last, last, last things, Jamie?
2498220	2499040	Because this is really it.
2499080	2500540	We're not saying anything after the song.
2500580	2500980	It's over.
2501000	2501800	The plug's getting pulled.
2506721	2508822	I guess out with the old and with the new.
2509902	2510522	Absolutely.
2511782	2512403	So here it is.
2512503	2513063	Abba-solutely?
2514063	2514763	Abba-solutely.
2515723	2517804	You know that herring roe I was talking about earlier?
2518264	2519144	The brand is Abba.
2520124	2520504	Awesome.
2521625	2522005	All right.
2522145	2523265	So you have tangents.
2523285	2523805	That's us.
2525481	2528523	You will keep going on with randomness as long as I let you.
2529264	2529944	Yes, I will.
2530204	2531685	Okay, play the damn song.
2531945	2533506	Group hug and chat, everybody.
2533987	2536588	Here it is, the last song and then the plug getting pulled.
2536928	2540251	Thank you from myself, DarkSakura, Loki, everybody.
2540351	2543112	Thank you for your support of Orange Lounge Radio.
2544013	2545054	We are starting over.
2545174	2547795	We'll see you tomorrow night at allgames.com.
2548155	2548836	Good night, everybody.
2641031	2642226	and more.
