Tonight, April 13th, 2008, Brazil bans a popular video game, could BBC shows soon be coming to the Nintendo Wii?
And we interview Farbs, the creator of Rom Check Fail.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
A very special week for us here at Orange Lounge Radio.
That's right, it's the first week of us live and exclusive on allgames.com.
The old chapter of our Orange Lounge Radio feed on Live 365 closed as of yesterday and now we're on our new home at allgames.com.
So a big hello to all of our new live listeners that we've got over at allgames.com.
and hello to those of you still joining us, be it through the podcast feed or our old OLR faithful or what be you.
Remember, you can always join our chat room to interact with the show.
Just a quick footnote for the live folks, it is a different chat room than all games usually uses.
You're going to want to head over to chat.orangeloungeradio.com or if you're already on the Game Surge Network.
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
to much to Bobby's dismay.
You do have the ferret here in the studio with us joining us.
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
Fine.
All right.
And you're full of pizza, if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah, breadsticks and stuff.
Yeah, when you came walking up to the door, you had like two pizza boxes.
I'm like, damn, Loki, you're fat.
Fat with a PH, Loki.
You know I love you.
But no, it was one pizza and one thing of bread.
By the way, we here at OLR, for those of you on all games who haven't heard our show before, we like food almost as much as we like video games.
I especially like video games about food.
Like Cooking Mama.
You know how some people say that they like to watch porn while they do it?
I like to eat food while I'm playing video games about food.
So while you're like playing Cooking Mama, do you actually cook things that you're cooking in Cooking Mama?
No, however, it did inspire me to try to make one of the dishes once.
We should try that one night.
We should do some, you know, Cooking Mama, like for reals.
The instructions in that game are actually semi-realistic.
I know.
A lot of those dishes are stuff I make anyway because I'm an awesome cook.
And so humble.
I know, I am.
But it's the same type of thing, you know.
Same situation, you know, to watch something and then, you know, participate, sort of.
DarkSakura.com
It was meaty, no.
So meaty.
No, my gaming week was actually, I know I always say it's pinball oriented, but this week was especially pinball oriented.
Because Dan is hosting his pinball group gathering tonight.
Hence another reason why I feel very blessed to be here tonight.
So I had to be around loud, stranger men that I don't know.
Anyway, so a lot of the week was actually spent testing out after shopping out some of the tables.
We've had his friend Will's Judge Dredd torn apart all over our garage right now.
And they just put it back together today and I hate that table.
Anyway...
We also went to one of our local used movie CD places called Dimple and we almost picked up some 7800 games, but then we remember that we probably already own them.
The way you know that you have too much in your collection is when you have to actually stop and ask yourself, do I own this or even worse, how many copies of this do I already have?
I've come home with a game for Dan, and now the unique thing about it is that I did have the manual in the box.
It's a 5200 game.
We had three other copies of it.
You need to get one of those little personal organizers just for your video game collections.
You can actually pull up an Excel spreadsheet on the go.
Like, do I have this game?
Does it have the manual with it?
Yes or no?
That's a pretty hardcore video game collector.
Well, we actually did have a list like that for a while.
And then I think we lost it in a computer crash.
and then we just were sort of like you've seen our vault oh yes we have an entire room dedicated to the collection and um it's sort of overwhelming now
It's actually a lot overwhelming now.
Have you ever thought, like, one of these days we just need to get rid of this shit?
Like, we need to call the 1-800-GOT-JUNK people or whatever it is.
Bite your tongue.
Ow.
It has been bitten.
Dan has said that we should get rid of some of it, and I'm like, you touch that collection, I kill you.
And then, when you're dead, it's all mine.
He'll divorce him when he's dead and then take over the collection.
I am the best wife ever
Do I want to buy a Virtual Boy system?
That's what I need to know.
Yes, you do want a Virtual Boy system.
Okay.
Well, how much do they want for it?
$75.
Actually, wait, I'm sorry.
I read that wrong.
It would be about $84.
Is that something you're looking at on eBay right now or something?
Yes.
Well, now that you just said that on air, everybody else is going to go look that up and jack the price up.
Let's buy it now.
Oh, buy it now.
Okay.
I don't know, it's a piece of gaming history
No, because you have to play.
In other words, you keep dying because there's no demo loop.
Have you ever thought of actually just like building like a mock cabinet and having just something that cycles like an emulator?
No, I don't want to build a cabinet for my desk because I think they'd be like, uh, what the hell's that in the office?
It's my new arcade cabinet.
Don't touch my arcade cabinet.
Actually, stuff that I played this week.
Yeah, I was going to say, you know, we here on Orange Lounge Radio, we like to stay on the current news, too.
Not just, you know, Virtual Boys and Atari 7800s.
Have you been playing, like, 360, Wii, any of that stuff?
This week I've only played two things, unfortunately.
First one, of course, is Multiplayer Saints Row, because we're still playing that damn game until we can get Grand Theft Auto 4, which I did find out today, well, not today, but earlier this week, that my boss is going to buy me a...
Special Edition of Grand Theft Auto 4 so that's awesome but at the same time I already pre-ordered another one just because you know we're going to need some for multiplayer and I think I need about two or three more copies on top of those too so five somewhere around there that reminds me I still have to fix my other 360 um
And then, other than Saints Row, I did play Mario Kart Wii.
A lot of Mario Kart Wii.
In fact, I've already finished 50cc and 100cc.
Of course, imported from the UK.
And, well, what can I say about the game?
It's Mario Kart.
I like some new levels that are in there.
I think they're really cool.
The only thing that... A couple gripes I have about the game.
Some of the levels that they chose, like the classic levels, are kind of stupid choices.
Rainbow Road.
They're not... Well, Rainbow Road's kind of annoying, but that's just Rainbow Road.
Especially even the battle modes.
The battle courses that they chose are just kind of crappy.
Which Rainbow Road did they bring over?
Thanks for watching!
I really think they could have chosen better tracks as well from the classic stuff.
Because there's a lot that just kind of resemble other tracks in the game that are already there.
I mean, there's three tracks that are kind of like the Donkey Kong... What was it?
The one from...
Double Dash.
They're kind of like that, where you have a giant cannon that launches you to the top of the track and you race down back to the cannon and stuff.
So, it's alright.
Some other weird gripes about it.
Battle mode is only team based.
You cannot play against individual people.
What? !
Yeah, you can only play against, you have to be on one team or the other.
So if you have three people or four people and you want to battle each other, well, you can't.
You have to be on two-man teams.
That sucks.
Yeah, it's retarded.
I wonder why they did that.
You would think that's something that, you know, doesn't take a whole lot of extra programming.
Oh, yeah, it's just lazy.
That's all it is.
Interesting.
That's a weird change.
Yeah, so that sucks.
Other than that, though, you can customize a lot of stuff in there, like different item drops.
I tried some of the ones that drop like the really supposedly big items like the more powerful items more frequently versus the normal drops and I didn't notice a difference so I don't know it's not very useful but
Try it online a little bit.
I was hardly able to get into any games right now.
Online is kind of crappy as far as connecting to a game.
But once you're in the game, it's fine.
I like the way that they have it where you pick courses and stuff.
You basically choose a course that you want.
Then the computer randomly selects which player's choice gets picked and stuff.
So that's kind of neat.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But yeah, it's okay.
I'm not very good at... I like playing as Yoshi or the medium carts, so it's not very fast and I get beat pretty quick sometimes.
But I like the tracks.
Some of the Mii integration in the game is pretty funny.
Especially there's a mall level that you play in and there's a bunch of signs and stuff that are all throughout the mall with different Miis on there.
And it's randomly selected each time you play the game.
So there was one that I was driving through
The very first time I played them all, my Chuck Norris Mii was on the coffee advertisement.
Then there's another one with Jesus on there.
And then later on in the level, you saw Hitler driving a car and stuff.
Just absolutely funny stuff.
And there's Goatse Mii driving a car one time.
But for some reason, it likes selecting Saddam and Hitler Mii's.
I don't know why, but I see them the most frequently.
All right.
DarkSakura's Mii always looks angry because she picked the little pointy eyebrows to make her look mad all the time, which is great.
So, yeah, you can play the game, and then eventually you unlock the Mii, the Drive S, which, here's my other gripe, and I haven't, I could be wrong about this, but I haven't tried multiplayer with it yet.
In single player, when you're playing as the Mii character, you can't select which Mii it uses.
It's only the one that you assign to your license.
So you can't swap it between other things, which is another lazy thing that they've done.
And it also has the most retarded voice I've ever heard for a character.
It's like a retarded Mario voice.
It's like... It's like, what the hell is that?
It sounds like Goat Boy Me or something.
What the hell is that?
I don't know, but... Can you make that sound again for us?
There you go.
So, I don't know.
I like the game.
I like it a lot better than Smash Bros., but I love Mario Kart, so...
What can I say?
What actually you thought was Jesus was just Bobby.
It could have been.
Possibly.
Looking at some other comments.
Some folks were talking about Mario Kart Double Dash because, you know, not everybody's played Mario Kart Wii yet, obviously, so it's been inspiring some talk about Mario Kart Double Dash.
And Osfer speaking up for Double Dash, saying Double Dash was some fun shit.
And Sephiroth1215 saying, yeah, see, I really don't understand why people don't like Double Dash.
It was okay.
It's just... Okay.
The thing I didn't like about Double Dash is the battle mode really sucked.
Like, the levels that they made for it, just awful.
And even some of the levels in... Oh, that's the other thing, too, about... I don't remember the other Mario games too well, the Mario Kart games, but from what I remember before, you didn't have a point limit or a time limit.
So...
In the battle mode this time, you have a three-minute time limit for each game that you play.
You can't just keep playing until someone loses, which is kind of lame.
And when you lose all your balloons, you just get them all back, and it just keeps counting more scores.
So the balloons are kind of pointless, too.
Interesting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But the good news is, though, for those that may have heard different stories claiming otherwise, the Classic Controller and the GameCube Controller are not gimped in any way whatsoever, so you can play them just fine with it.
In fact, I use the Classic Controller for these games.
But I mentioned there's got to be a huge difference between using an analog stick to control something and using the motion.
There's got to be a huge difference.
Yeah, I don't like the motion at all.
And doing all the gestures that do different things, it's not very fun.
Interesting.
I prefer the classic controller of the GameCube.
I can't stand Toadette.
Toadette sucks.
I don't know.
Overall, it's a pretty cool game.
I just wish there were some better tracks.
Some of the classic tracks that they picked were kind of stupid.
Just like, kind of, well, this track's easy, the remakes, so let's just pick this one instead of actually picking good tracks.
That's my only gripe.
But other than that, it is an awesome game.
DS Chargers, but they don't carry the ones you can plug in the wall.
So, and I wasn't able to convince them to take me over to a GameStop or whatever, so I was just like, alright, so I'm just gonna, I guess, watch TV.
And then it dawned on me, even though my parents, they only have a 56.6K dial-up connection to the internet.
Oh my god, so slow when you're spoiled with broadband.
But they have the 56.6K connection to the internet.
I downloaded emulators.
Super Nintendo Games I'd Missed
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Do you like a cleric?
Sort of, but I don't think that's what he's called in the game.
He's just a hero, is what he's called.
He's a goat whisperer.
Well, in my game, he was called Butters, because you can name him whatever you want.
So I named him Butters, because I like that name.
Yeah, so I played a lot of Soul Blazer this week.
Otherwise, as far as newer games go, I went back to an MMO this week that I haven't played in a while.
I hope it's not Final Fantasy XI.
It is not Final Fantasy XI, but you would still be surprised.
You know what MMO I played this week that I haven't played?
and DarkSakura
I actually downloaded the expansion, The Ambition of the Illuminous, or whatever it's called.
I've always jokingly called it The Abortion of the Illuminous.
Well, not on Xbox 360.
You can't get it.
Really?
I could have gotten it for you for free.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have not yet, though, gotten the mag and all this other stuff that supposedly PSU is bringing back some of the old school stuff from Phantasy Star Online, but I'm not that far off yet.
They've got the original four stages, too.
And I know that the people that are probably, if you're looking to play this game and you haven't done it yet, it's like 20 bucks now.
It's very cheap.
And Rob, casts can use four skills now.
That's about time.
Final Fantasy XI
Not too bad of a deal, I gotta say, if you want to get sucked into that crack.
So you have several MMO crack things to choose from on the Xbox 360.
Alright, that's going to do it for our gaming week.
That was quite a bit tonight.
We had a lot of games to talk about.
Let's talk about some housekeeping news.
Of course, last night the plug was pulled on our Live365 feed.
It's no longer there.
Speaking of Live365, oh my god.
I wrote them a cancellation email a week ago.
You're supposed to give them three business days to cancel, right?
I wrote them an email a week ago.
No response.
Wrote them a second notice like Thursday or Friday.
No response.
Guess who charged my card today?
The buttheads.
Does the fun ever start?
I'll keep you guys posted next week what happens with that.
We might have to get nasty.
Things keep going down this route because essentially they've taken money from me that I didn't pay for.
It's kind of pissing me off.
Call your bank and
That's what I'm going to do.
Stop payment.
So hello to allgames.com, our new home, which has deducted no money from my bank account this week, thankfully, because there are great people over at allgames.com who aren't sucking my money away, and they're friends, and we definitely urge you to check out the programming that's at allgames.com.
They have something new every night.
They re-air a bunch of podcasts that go on throughout the week.
Some of them have their debut on All Games Radio, so check that out.
We debut, of course, Sunday nights before us, Bobby Blackwolf.
In the morning times, All Games Interactive is on every day, Monday through Friday.
So that show's on, I think, 10 a.m., 11 a.m., and they go through most of the morning.
which would be actually early afternoon for the East Coast folks.
So it really works out great for the East Coast folks who have to stay up really late to listen to us.
And again, we want to remind you we have a special guest tonight, Farbs of Rom Check Fail fame.
And if you like Orange Lounge Radio, you want to get to know us a little better, join our social networking.
That's right, we're MySpace whores just like everybody else and Facebook and all that other stuff.
Our MySpace is MySpace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
We also have a live journal community at Orange Lounge, no radio.
and Facebook.
Just search for OL Army and you can add us on all those sites and stay tuned with all the news and when we shift networks and all that stuff you'll be on top of things and know where to catch us.
Apparently the chat room is loving the new sound by the way because our feed now is 96k.
So...
It's a lot clearer, the feed, than the 64K we were on with Live 365.
So they're really happy with that.
And I think our podcast listeners are going to notice we also changed the audio on the podcast to be similar to what we're broadcasting at now.
So it's going to be a whole new sound.
That's okay, Rob.
I'll just talk like this.
We'll ruin the audio quality of the show this way.
Yeah, we'll just do it this way.
All right.
How much are you going to disagree with me tonight?
What do you think I'll let you disagree with me tonight?
Anyways, let's see.
So this week, the publisher of Famitsu Magazine thinks that they have an idea of what may be happening on E3 this year, one of the announcements.
Their guess is that Nintendo is going to be announcing yet another revision of the DS.
And their thinking behind this is because the timing seems to be right.
Apparently every two years or so is when they...
Revise their portable systems.
For example, there was the 1996 Game Boy Pocket.
In 1998, there was the Game Boy Color.
In 2001, there was the Game Boy Advance.
In 2003, there was the Game Boy Advance SP.
In 2004, there was the DS.
In 2006, there was the DS Lite.
In 2008...
The DS Micro
Who knows?
Or maybe they'll just do nothing and won't they feel stupid?
Okay, so in other words, Famitsu Magazine is basically saying this.
Nintendo likes to redo shit and make you buy it all over again all the time.
So 2008 will be nothing new.
Yes.
Is essentially what they're saying.
Yes.
And this is news how?
I don't know.
It's news because... I don't know.
Because we're talking about E3.
And people like talking about E3.
Odd One says, but this time it's got, what the hell else can they do to this thing other than make it smaller or give it storage?
Ah, there's a thought.
What about turning the DS a little bit PSP-ish where, hey, not only is it a DS, but it plays MP3s and it has scheduling things.
I refuse to buy one if it does that.
Wait, wait, I gotta know this.
Why is that?
Because the same reason why I'm not too fond of the PSP.
It's got way too much shit in it.
If I want to play a game, I want a system that plays a game.
I have an iPhone already.
Hello?
I have to be honest.
That's kind of one thing I like about the PSP is that it's a little bit of everything.
You know what I mean?
I think it's kind of neat.
If you want your video game system to have everything, then that's fine.
If that's what you want.
But for me personally, because I already have the means to do all this other stuff, I really just want my system to play my video games.
Here's something, a thought, and I could see this happening more than I could see, say, a new system coming out.
Maybe an expansion that would plug into the bottom of the Game Boy Advance slot or whatever, and you would plug in your SD memory card, because guess what?
You have an SD memory card slot on your Wii, and so maybe this...
I don't know, device or whatever that you plug into the bottom.
That is flashable and that you can have firmware upgrades to and whatnot to allow it to play, say, emulate different games like the Virtual Console or stuff like that or WiiWare or something like that.
I can see that happening because that would be a little easier they can't just get rid of like if they make it a slimmer they're going to get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot then you're going to have stuff that uses it like say Guitar Hero on tour I don't think they're going to screw that over because that would be good for them
They can't get rid of the Game Boy Advance slot just yet.
So why would they give you a device where you could get all this shit basically for free from the virtual console when they could recharge for it and people would buy it?
Well, because I don't think people would buy it.
I think people would rather have a service available where they can download all these games and I think you'd get a lot more people downloading games.
It's a lot easier to download games on the virtual console and pay a lot more money that way.
That also saves some packaging.
They don't have to press any of these stupid cartridges.
I think the packaging and stuff, that would save them a lot of money, and it doesn't really cost them anything to transfer a file.
It's just, you know, basically what they're going to probably want to do is prevent people from pirating this stuff, and that's about it.
Because right now with those other SD memory card things, yeah, you can pirate games like No End, but they'd have to create something that you wouldn't be able to do that.
Well, we'll see what happens.
And besides, think of all the other things you could do.
I mean, it's essentially just like that PlayOn thing that they have available now.
You could use that as Game Boy, you know, not necessarily for, you know, virtual console games and stuff like that.
MP3s, you can use it for, like, maybe small media files, you know, playing a really, really, really low-res movie or something like that, you know.
Like, think of, I don't know, your...
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura
And we talked about this a little bit last week, and this is a bit of a follow-up, is that there was a rumor that Final Fantasy IV was, yes, it's going to be North American bound because it showed up on the cover of Nintendo Power and all this stuff.
Well, Squeenix confirmed it this week.
Final Fantasy IV will be coming out July 22nd in North America, which is a little bit off from the date I seem to recall Loki mentioning last week.
Well, they revised it, bumped it up a week.
All because of you, probably, right?
Yeah.
I'm just kidding.
It is, of course, Final Fantasy IV with some graphical upgrades.
They also get this fully voiced cutscenes and other added content.
So that's going to be interesting, this whole mini-movie thing.
And then my mistake from last week, it wasn't Dragon Quest V, it was Dragon Quest IV.
Oh, okay.
That's also on its way, but that's a secret type thing, right?
Shh, secret.
Alright, so we'll see what happens next from Squeenix.
I guess that's probably why this game has taken a long time to come out from Japan to the US is because they're having to redo the voices now too, which I'm sure can't be an easy thing on the DS because then they have to go basically remake the whole cartridges and all that.
So please, voice acting, don't suck in this.
Please do not ruin my fond, fond memories of Final Fantasy 4 or I'll cry.
I just see why they can't leave it intact.
But no.
But no.
Maybe the classic version will be in there somewhere.
I don't know.
One can hope.
Well, at any rate, something else that has made a lot of people on the internet go squee, but not squeenix, okay, is a Strong Bad game coming to WiiWare, and I am very happy about this.
Did you watch the trailer?
I have not seen the trailer yet.
Remember, I was on 56.6k most of the week.
The trailer is hilarious, but there is a game coming out called Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, which is, yeah...
SBCG4AP
And they're the ones that did the Sam & Max games.
Are they?
Interesting.
Speaking of which, that Sam & Max for the Wii, that's season one.
Only.
Only season one.
Oh, thank you for the update.
Appreciate it.
But it should be reasonable.
Well, there's going to be a trailer.
The trailer is actually posted in our chat room right now.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com from Tigerclaw found it on YouTube and dug that up.
Going back to the last story because there's a lot of comments on the voice chat on Final Fantasy IV.
Going back to some comments from our chat room.
Let's see.
Jonathan F. is fantasizing Final Fantasy VI with voices because you would have the opera scene with singing.
Celeste would actually sing the opera.
That could go either way.
DRAGON QUEST 4
Shadow Slayer thinks it could be good if they get good voice actors Odd One says it's dependent on how big the card for the game is and Zeppelin says why can't they put one to two gigabyte in a DS card?
I'm pretty sure they can, can't they?
I think they can.
Why not?
If your camera can fit like two gigabytes I'm sure those DS cards can crank in like four gigabytes on those cards.
You'd probably get some pretty massive games on there.
So this is another rumor.
Was there more on the Strong Bad stuff?
I had more to say.
Oh, sure.
But that's okay.
Well, there's nobody in chat commenting on it either.
What do you guys think of the Strong Bad game?
Oh, Black Wolf says the Strong Bad game is also coming to the PC.
So if you don't want to download that on the Wii, you can also get it on the PC.
Well, I was going to say the type of game is a 3D point.
To actually quote a quote from Strong Bad.
Okay.
It is a puffy 3D point and click them up adventure.
You need to do it in the Strong Bad voice.
No.
Dan can do the strong and bad voice.
I cannot.
You can turn the light switch on or off.
That's all I remember.
All right.
I did not install it so you could have a light switch rave.
What do you think?
Winner or sellout?
I hope so.
It all depends on the game.
But that's hopeful if it's the same folks that did Sam and Max.
We'll see.
Another game that hopefully will be coming soon, Elebits 2.
And of course, this is coming from the latest issue of the official Nintendo magazine, reporting that Elebits 2 will be due out on the Wii later this year.
Which is odd, because I thought it was supposed to be due out on the DS later this year.
Either way, it'll be coming to a Nintendo system this year, probably, and hopefully won't be just mediocre like the last game.
I kind of like the last game, with the level designs and stuff like that.
The last game was kind of neat, but there was something about it that didn't keep me there long-term, you know what I mean?
I don't know if I just felt like there wasn't a...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Now they have a lot more they can play with.
I'm sure technologies have come along in developing the Wii games as well as online possibly, which could be interesting.
I don't know what they could do with a DS version of the game because a lot of that game required you to be able to pull on the remote and twist it and stuff like that.
It'd be hard to not have that depth sensing that the Wii version had in the DS version.
Some comments from chat on Elebits.
Sephiroth1215 not happy from this.
Ah, no, I hate Elebits.
And RawSteelUT says, it's Elebits, no one cares.
Frisbee wants to mention it was a launch title in Japan.
Quiltipo says, Elebits seemed good at the time, but no staying power though.
And Gerardimo says, Elebits was good and innovative, just shallow.
That might actually be a good way of phrasing it.
But I don't know.
I mean, you really want to appreciate Elebits, but I don't know.
It just kind of got old quick.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to join in the fun here on this Sunday night.
Remember, we are on a new network, AllGames.com.
At this time, we're not.
It's just too much to read the All Games chat and the Orange Lounge chat.
And we have people chatting on Justin.TV as well who thinks I'm neglecting them over on Justin.TV.
I'm not.
It's just a lot to read and try to do a show at the same time and bring you more gaming news like this one about the white...
GameCube Controllers
and now Mario Kart Wii we know is going to support the GameCube controller so this is going to be coming out in Japan but the odd thing is why not a WaveBird controller that would make so much more sense because the WaveBird was pretty awesome I don't know if it's a cost thing or what
But who knows if this will be coming out here.
It's actually a lot sooner and later this year.
That is coming out later this month, according to Nintendo of Japan's website.
So, pretty cool.
I don't know, do you think they ought to bring white wavebirds to the Wii?
Or does it matter because if you didn't buy one... Because there already are wavebirds?
Huh?
Because there already are wavebirds?
But they don't make them anymore.
So?
So you're basically saying screw you to everyone who didn't get one, like me.
I can bring them over.
You suck.
But honestly, and I'll tell you this, remember when they came out with those different colored controllers for the GameCube?
Well, um...
GameStop, GameCrazy
You sometimes see these little random import things too at random stores.
You just kind of have to look around, you know what I mean?
I'll tell you one, our oddest find as far as import anything went at actual GameStop was buying Capcom Classic Collection Volume 2, which was the Ghosts and Goblins, the Makai Mura, Dai Makai Mura.
But it never came out here, right?
No, we never got that collection.
We got the Japanese one.
Hmm.
at a GameStop in Hilltop Mall.
Several people in chat, by the way, mentioning that the WaveBirds did not have Rumble.
Perhaps that's the reason Nintendo is deciding not to do it.
Because Sony learned the hard way, you gotta have Rumble.
Rumble is not so last gen, as they tried to say at E3 a couple years ago.
They learned the hard way, so maybe that's why.
But why, I mean, is a WaveBird with Rumble that hard to do?
I mean, is it?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just me.
It's impossible.
If the Xbox 360 wireless can do rumble, I would think.
Maybe it's just me.
It's not that hard.
I didn't think so.
I mean, I'm not even, no, no, no, no, no.
All right, moving on.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And if you don't know anything about Soul Eater, there's a Wikipedia article, so enjoy.
But it will be coming to the U.S.
Actually, my apologies.
So far, it's listed as Japan only, and I don't think it's going to be coming out anywhere else.
I mean, because honestly, I don't even think the Soul Eater manga has come out over in the U.S., has it?
You're asking the wrong guy about when it comes to manga.
The whole point of the...
of the, I guess, manga is that these people are going to this technical school to make weapons and have to make this one weapon out of 99 evil human souls and one belonging to this witch to make a death scythe.
Which I think death scythe, and I think back to Gundam Wing, so whatever.
Well, the way you describe it, it sounds kind of cool.
Yeah, it would be something I would read.
But I don't know if that's something that would come out here.
No, I mean, I don't know.
I'll read the manga, I guess.
I almost bought that game on DS.
I'll Never Forgive Him for that PlayStation 1.
What was PlayStation 1?
Was that Legend of Mana?
Legend of Mana.
Oh my god, I hated that game.
You know what my problem with Legend of Mana was?
I hated that game.
What?
I imported it like a dumbass.
And that was the most text-intensive, kanji-heavy game I have ever freaking played.
and I could read like five words on an entire page.
You know what other Squeenix collection I can't stand?
And they've done more than one games in the series and I can't even remember the name of it.
It's the one where there's like eight different people and they have the eight stories.
Saga Frontier.
I freaking hate the Saga series.
Cannot stand it.
Sorry, RPG fans and Saga fans, but...
If you thought that, you know, because I do give Final Fantasy a lot of love here on the show, Chrono series, things like that, but if you thought that Squeenix could do no wrong, just go play the Saga series sometime.
It's pretty good.
Why didn't they ever carry on, like, the Tobol series?
I like that one.
What about Alundra?
Or Brave Fencer Musashi was them, wasn't it?
Yeah, they did a new one.
Those were cute.
I like PlayStation 2.
Yeah.
So, this is also another article kind of correcting some more wrongs with Mario Kart Wii.
Apparently, there was news before that Mario Kart Wii did not work with the Freeloader.
However, that is false.
It actually does work just fine with the Freeloader.
So, if you happen to live in the U.S.
and want to pick up a copy of the European version...
and get it a few weeks before we get it here.
Then go right ahead and pick one up because the freeloader will work just fine.
In fact, import retailer NCS tested the game on a version 3.1 firmware and it ran just fine.
And apparently there was some issues, I guess, with 3.0 firmware.
So if you update your firmware, it should be good to go.
But I don't know.
Great game.
Well, apparently on Mario Kart Wii, there are already people cheating in there.
And it's in the time trials mode, apparently.
There's all these impossible times that are showing up in the time trials mode.
Apparently, somebody on the official Nintendo Magazine forums wrote this on here.
I only saw it on the snowboard track.
There was a guy with a time of 53 points, something or other seconds.
There are about three other people with exactly the same time.
Like others have said, on the replay, the guy just does one lap really slow and then turns the opposite way just after the finish line.
Then the replay doesn't stop.
So he says, personally, I think it's a bug.
I've only seen it on one track and there are others with the same time.
Apparently what's happening, and I'm not positive this is actually the case, but what I heard was that if you let the time trial sit there for longer than 99 minutes and 99 seconds and .99, it'll actually loop back around to zero again.
So people were racing through a couple laps or whatever, and then they would stop, wait for it to just barely flip over from
You know, who has time to do that?
I mean, really?
You're going to sit there and wait for 99 minutes or even, you know, just leaving it on, doing that.
I don't know what the hell you're doing, you know, going up.
Obsessed people.
Going out drinking or something and coming back 90 minutes later just to have a high score.
That we all know is a piece of crap.
Well the thing about that too though, Nintendo has actually removed those scores off of their leaderboards now.
So Nintendo is cracking down.
Now I'm just waiting for it to happen where people find a way to cheat in the multiplayer mode.
You know what I mean?
That's going to be a... Oh my god.
I hope Nintendo knows a way to patch this game on the fly if things like that happen.
We'll see.
I don't know.
I don't think they have it built in yet where they can patch games.
I know they don't have it built in yet where they can patch games.
Does their firmware updates patch the games?
There's firmware updates, but I don't think they patch games.
The good thing, though, is they don't have an action replay yet for the Wii.
They only have game saves and power saves and stuff like that.
I don't know.
There shouldn't really be a way to cheat, unless you do something with the servers or whatever where you lag someone out.
But
Plus it just goes back to, if you're cheating online, why?
You know, why?
Really?
What do you got to prove?
I don't know.
You know what I mean?
Like, oh, you beat three other strangers in an online Mario match when Nintendo doesn't even tell you who you're playing against.
I mean, it's kind of like, big wow.
You know?
It's like, do you really have to feel that special?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just me.
Well, speaking of special people, you know that there's always that time top 100 most influential people that they do.
And guess who's on the list this year?
Hmm.
Miyamoto!
He is on the list this year.
Nice.
He has been voted for 25,000 times as of the source I'm reading.
So he's at number 31 out of 200.
And is at 56%.
And basically he's been put on there for making Mario and Zelda...
and uh for uh the new Wii stuff you know the things he's trying to do with the Wii um and that and as he's been quoted saying that he wants to make people more aware of their bodies and get in better shape and and use that as a tool to improve their life and not just slack around you know
How much influence does the online poll have in the final result?
Captain America's Shield
Hey, some comments from Justin TV, actually, who says I ignore them all the time.
But a good comment here about the whole patching of Wii games.
Richie Maniac says they can't patch, otherwise they would have fixed Guitar Hero 3 without sending out new discs.
Very good point.
So if somebody's cheating in Mario Kart, there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, I'm putting the link to vote for Miyamoto in the chat room.
But you could cheat however much you want.
and BlackWolf is correcting me and saying it's Colbert.
I thought that was just something he did on the show.
Is his last name really Colbert?
I thought that was just a show joke.
I know people with the exact same last name in real life, but they pronounce it with the hard T. That's why it's the Colbert Report.
I thought that was a joke.
People, don't correct me, okay?
This is pissing me off.
It's hot in here.
It is hot in here today.
What is up with the weather?
Well, there's another game that got announced this week during Nintendo's Media Summit.
And this is not really a big surprise at all.
In fact, I want to say we've already seen this being announced at E3 last year, but whatever.
Anyways, it is Super Mario, or I should say Mario Super Sluggers.
And...
It is, of course, a continuation of Super Mario Stadium Baseball.
Just another sports game from Nintendo that's capitalizing on Mario, just like Mario Strikers and stuff.
I hope they don't do this, but I could just see them, because they're kind of following the bad trends that third-party companies are creating accessories for, like those attachments for the Wii Sports stuff.
I could just see them releasing this game with a baseball bat attachment or something for the Wii.
I don't know, try to sell a few more copies.
Yeah.
Here's my question.
What really is the difference between the Super Sluggers thing and the Strikers?
I mean, aren't they just kind of both baseball games?
No, Strikers is a soccer game, whereas Sluggers is a baseball game.
Oh, what the hell am I thinking?
Why am I... But there's another... Wasn't there another... Yeah, there was Mario Baseball.
Yeah, I know there's another baseball game that already freaking came out on the Wii.
Really?
It was on the GameCube?
No, it was on the GameCube, yeah.
I could have sworn there was already a baseball game on the Wii.
No, just like how there was... Was it...
I don't remember what the other... There was another soccer game that was on GameCube as well.
So it's just import whatever sport with Mario in it.
Pretty soon it'll be Mario synchronized swimming.
Just in time for the Beijing Olympics.
I don't see how there could be any popular Japanese franchise that won't have a baseball game attached to it.
I guess that's true.
Baseball is like the sport.
I guess that's true.
And guess what, Rob?
You'll be happy to know that Toadette is in this game as well.
Bitch.
Alright.
RossSteelUT in chat.orangelearn.com says, Oh, baseball on the Wii.
This will appeal to the fanboys, really.
The casuals still have Wii Sports.
Well, I would think that baseball fanboys would go for something a little more hardcore.
Like MLB 2K8?
I don't know if it would necessarily be on the Wii.
Or MLB Power Pros, you know, where it was just another baseball game?
Or...
They've already got, like, plenty of baseball games on there.
I would think these are the people that do like baseball on Wii Sports, but want to take it, like, one step further.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I don't know how appealing that is, but Jamie does have a good point.
Especially over in Japan, baseball is huge.
And, you know, baseball's huge here, too.
It may not be as big as football in this day and age, but...
That's fine, this game will come out in the E3 or whatever.
I have a feeling, because I heard some rumors before that this was going to be coming out in June, and then in July there was supposed to be that stupid disaster day of crisis.
I don't remember what blog I read that in, but if this does come out and stuff, and then E3 rolls around, and oh, guess what, Wii Sports 2, and it's like, ah, shit, I just bought this game, and now...
WeSports 2, which is going to be probably the number one selling game all time on Wii.
Mario Hockey.
Several people want to see that game in our chatroom.
A Mario Hockey game.
I don't know, though, because I think Nintendo might have a problem with people punching Mario in the face.
Mario Hockey, all that would be is just like Super Mario Strikers with re-skin, basically, because...
You know what they need?
They need to bring back old school ice hockey.
I actually had this game on the NES.
I'm not talking Blades of Steel, although that game was freaking rad too, but I'm talking old school ice hockey.
Remember this game where you had your entire team consisted of the fat guys, the skinny guys, and the average guys.
Remember that?
Yeah.
That's what they need to do.
Ice Hockey 2008, or Ice Hockey Wii.
That'd be rad.
You know you want it.
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
On the Nintendo Wii, nothing either.
This is a dry week in Japan for these next batch of systems.
But if you want to go back to the PlayStation 2, Ape Escape 3 is coming out now in a Chinese language.
So for the other Asian regions abroad, Ape Escape 3 comes out in Chinese this week.
Also a game called Hoshigari Empusa comes out in Japan on April the 17th.
and going over to the Nintendo DS, Gear Spirit from TV Animation One Piece.
Gear Spirit.
Also from Nintendo, Pack'n Ball comes out.
S, Actdeft, Drew,
Also on the Nintendo DS, Kansu Hajime Yoshisan Unyo DS comes out.
And this is just... I don't know.
The cover has a bunch of people planting trees on it.
And I don't know if that's supposed to symbolize a tree of knowledge or what that is.
Because the category for the game is miscellaneous.
Which usually means some type of boring training type thing.
I don't think it's a dating sim.
Because you actually use the touch screen and stuff.
But...
It's a perverted dating sim, no.
No, not that kind of dating.
It's not like, you know, I don't know.
I'm joking, Rob.
Let's see if there's anything coming out on the PSP, although I somehow doubt it.
But we'll take a look real quick for the PSP in Japan.
No.
But the 24th will be a big week.
There's lots more stuff coming out for you folks in Japan on the 24th.
But this week, you're going to have to just play the games you already have, I guess.
That's it.
For the games that are coming out for our friends over in the UK, we have on the 16th, Trackmania Nations Forever on PC.
Trackmania.
This is going to look pretty awesome.
Is it?
Yeah.
Okay.
I want that Konami track game where you can play as Pyramid Head.
That's the one I'm waiting for.
I know, right?
The new track and field?
Yeah.
Do you want?
The hell with all the other track games.
July or August.
All right, thank you.
Anyway, also coming out, now this is on the 18th of this next series of games, which is the day before my birthday.
Emergency Mayhem on Wii.
Hard to Be a God on PC.
I think I'm going to need to get that game, okay?
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC UEFA Euro 2008 on PC Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 and PS2 and PSP and WonderSwan Color and Neo Geo Pocket Color and the Neo Geo CD those last four are probably not true
8-Ball All-Stars on DS.
We have Namco Museum Remix on Wii.
I need to get that.
The World Ends With You on DS.
That's a lot of pressure, isn't it?
That sounds like something you'd say before you kill someone.
No, that sounds like a Bond movie.
Oh, it does.
It does sound like a Bond movie.
And the very last is Time Crisis 4 on PlayStation 3.
Yeah, Time Crisis.
In the US, it's an okay release week, I should say.
Starting off, we've got Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars for the DS.
It's kind of an arcade-style version of that game.
Sherlock Holmes Nemesis on the PC.
AMF Bowling Pinbusters on the DS.
Rondo of Swords on the DS Okami on the Wii Jack Keane on the PC
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue on the PS3.
That's just a small old game there.
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on PC.
Also on PC this week, Turok and Europa Universalist Rome.
That's kind of a weird name.
High School Musical 2 worked this out on the DS.
Also another Disney DS game.
What if I don't want to work it out?
Then you don't buy the game.
Alright, I won't.
Another Disney DS game, Cory in the House.
The Sims 2 Kitchen and Bath Interior Design Stuff expansion for the PC.
Oh, yay!
Summer Sports Paradise Island for the Wii.
Also being brought out by Destineer, which has crappy games.
Teenage Zombies Invasion of the Alien Brain thingies for the DS.
Emergency Mayhem for the Wii, which is supposed to be just like Crazy Taxi.
And as Rob mentioned earlier, the Final Fantasy XI Vanadil Collection 2008 for the PC.
We have other releases.
Do you want to get into that kind of crack?
What about the Virtual Console?
Well, these, of course, have already come out now.
These are for our UK releases for Virtual Console.
It's Yoshi's Cookie!
Which is 500 Wii Points, the equivalent of 5 Euro or 3 pounds 50.
And it's Yoshi's Cookie.
What more do I need to say about freaking Yoshi's Cookie?
That it was far superior on the Super Nintendo.
So why they released the Nintendo version, I have no idea.
Now the next one.
We need triumphant music for this, for these next two.
Hold on, hold on.
I do have fanfare music somewhere.
It'll just take me a minute.
Can you read a different one before you get to those two?
Well, the next two are, these are the only two left.
Actually, are they?
No, there's more.
I will skip ahead and then I will go back to the awesome ones.
Alright, good, because I'm getting the fanfare right now.
California Games, which is Commodore 64.
Ooh, Commodore 64 games are hitting the Wii finally.
And Impossible Mission.
That's the one I should have played the fanfare for.
Both of them are 500 Wii points, 3 pounds 50 pence, or a 5 euro.
But those aren't the two that... Stay a while.
Stay forever.
Did you ever play Impossible Mission?
I didn't have a Commodore 64, Rob.
Really?
I told you I didn't.
That's right.
You know what I had?
I had the Texas Instruments stupid retardo computer.
And I had a Clico Atom.
I'm still trying to find the sounds.
Darn it.
Well, then I will go ahead.
Because I will go ahead and announce the one that semi gets fanfare.
Oh, you know why?
Because here's the thing.
I had to upgrade Winamp to get Shoutcast now.
And for whatever reason, my Winamp is not playing WAV files.
Although you think it would.
The old one did.
I just haven't configured it right.
So we have no sounds tonight.
Okay.
We'll have Loki sing a fanfare.
Wait, hold on.
Loki, sing the fanfare.
I'm not singing the fanfare.
Sing the fanfare.
No fanfare.
Please.
Use the NBC music.
No.
You can't use it, can you?
Just read it.
We're wasting so much time.
Precious time.
Alright, Wonder Boy from the Sega Master System.
500 Wii Points.
And that game is really sweet, but this is the one that makes me super uber happy.
Fantasy Zone!
Didn't we announce this last week?
Yay!
I think we announced it was coming, but it wasn't really known when it was coming.
It's out now, you're the Opa Opa, and you get to shoot stuff, and it sort of plays like Defender, but it's awesome.
Fantasy Zone is my second favorite game ever.
and was one of the classic games of the week as well.
It was the first classic game of the week.
By the way, in the US on the Virtual Console you also get Yoshi's Cookie and Bases Loaded came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
Speaking of baseball games, if you want to play one of the classics, Bases Loaded will set you back 500 Wii Points.
Now we'll go back to some gaming news.
And, uh, I don't know.
This isn't exactly like totally gaming news.
This is basically what idiots think.
I don't know.
Maybe this should be a new segment on our show.
What idiots think.
I don't know.
Here's the deal.
There's this website and it's called whattheyplay.com.
It's a parental-oriented website, and they did a poll a little earlier this week.
What they did in this poll is that they surveyed, what would you find most offensive in a video game?
Here's the results.
The choices were a graphically severed human head, a man and a woman having sex, multiple use of the F word, and two men kissing.
Here's the thing.
The least offensive, according to the poll, is multiple usages of the F word, 10%.
The second least offensive, a graphically severed human head with 26%.
And then, two men kissing, 27%.
So two men kissing is right in the same ballpark as a graphically severed human head in how offensive they are in a video game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's been that way forever.
I have to say that we are probably one of the most... I'd have to say conflicting societies as far as... Because, you know, sex sells everything.
And everything, you know, the porn industry is thriving.
There's all this.
Yet we have this other extreme like, oh, but we don't talk about that.
Oh, we don't do this.
Oh, we don't have this in our game.
Oh, this is offensive.
People just need to get over it.
Siren says in our chat room, Siren, I keep mispronouncing it, says, what did the two men look like?
I guess that is important because if they're like two guys who haven't bathed in a week, that would be kind of offensive, I think.
I don't think the kissing would be offensive.
I would just think that the lack of personal hygiene would be offensive.
See if that's the point.
So where does, like, say, I don't know, two men kissing a graphically severed human head on top of a man and woman having sex while they shout obscenities, where does that fall on the list?
Is this your next dream game?
WhatTheyPlay.com The Game
It's whattheyplay.com, the game.
And what it is is it stars three people, two guys and a girl.
And all they do is they know how to say the F word.
So we get the 10% there.
And meanwhile, the two guys will kiss.
And then the man and the woman will have sex while they sever the other guy's head.
I'm not sure what...
I'm not sure where the game is in this, but we'll find it somewhere.
To take pictures.
Yeah, like Pokemon Snap.
Okay, there it is.
And the more offensive the photo is...
The more gee the photo is, then that's beautiful, Rob.
I love this idea.
I love your sick imagination.
It's What They Play Snap.
Okay, I want to change the name.
Okay, so an OLR dream game.
Here it is.
What They Play Snap.
Add this to our wiki.
Yes.
We need a dream games wiki.
There is.
The dream games wiki.
There is?
Yes.
Okay, cool.
There's already a wiki page on there, so we'll need to get this added.
What They Play Snap.
And in What They Play Snap...
is three people that use the F word, then half kiss each other, then half sex with each other, then kill each other while you take pictures on a track.
And then in later stages, in later stages, you get the pester ball.
Because no one likes a pester ball.
We seriously have problems.
Rob is red in the face.
I don't think it's from the heat.
He's just so excited about the idea.
I don't know, because I find this immature shit funny.
Okay, let's go back to the root problem, though, here, is this survey.
Obviously, we're being a little bit facetious with this whole stuff here.
The problem is... I'm not.
I want the game.
Quick poll.
We need to do an Insta poll right now in Orange Lounge.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
I want to see some Y's or N's.
Would you buy what they play Snap?
Y or N. Would you play it?
Let's say the game costs $29.99.
Would you buy it?
And it's on Nintendo Wii.
Would you buy it?
Y or N?
I think that's what makes that the most...
Act now, we'll throw in a severed head controller cover for your severed head attachment.
It'll be a severed head camera.
Somebody in chat said something about this and I thought it was really good.
I think it was RawSteelUT had said something and I lost it here.
Oh, here it is.
Seriously, this isn't exactly a scientific poll.
You'd get different results on game facts.
And it does have to do with the audience that was sampled because it was more of a conservative audience.
But still, I mean, doesn't that kind of say something about just society in general?
I mean, maybe this goes beyond gaming a little bit.
Pardon us for getting so deep.
But seriously, guys...
and DarkSakura.com.
I don't know.
Me personally, I cannot watch the Saw movies.
That level of violence.
I watched the first one and I was like, that's enough.
I've heard about what's in the other ones.
I don't need to see it.
If you want to watch it, have fun.
You want to see that sick shit, go for it.
But for me, I don't want to watch that.
There's other things I could watch with my time, like Showgirls.
Showgirls is great.
And for the record, I've never seen a Saw movie and never will.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura.com
Here are the results of our quick poll.
Would you buy our game on the Nintendo Wii?
Y, Y, Y, N. Throw the pester ball at the people having sex and they look up at you and say, fuck.
Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y. I'd buy it for my whole Sunday school class.
I'd buy a Nintendo Wii for it.
Y, N, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y in a fucking instant, N, Y.
There you have it.
The results of the OLR Quick Poll.
Interesting comment as well from Odd1.
Torture porn is just what the name says.
I'll leave it, but nothing against those who watch it.
Why?
Because I don't bloody think that one piece of media is going to completely change a person and destroy whatever moral fiber they might have.
And Drew Nami says, case in point, Ichi the Killer.
There's a lot of sick shit out there in movies.
If you want to watch it, go for it.
But, you know, on the other hand, if people want to watch...
If people want to play a game that might involve a sexual component, whatever, right?
That's what warnings are for.
Hi.
Exactly.
It's what reviews are for.
Hi.
Read them, you know.
Be educated.
Be a little educated when it comes to purchasing your games?
You know what?
People should just be educated in general and not so freaking head up their ass.
That's what I think.
Get your head out of your ass.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Okay.
Legos!
Legos aren't really games, but they do make Lego games.
I think the Lego Star Wars games are tons of fun.
Now there is going to be, by Activision, a Lego Indiana Jones game that's going to be out on the 6th of June.
You can actually play as over 60 characters and some of his friends and some of the enemies.
You can actually customize your characters by mixing out their parts.
You know, like when you play with Legos.
And you have your whip.
From what I'm seeing, using the whip is sort of like...
Pitfall.
Because they're saying that you use it to get over gaps and hit switches and you can use it to pick up items in the game to throw at people.
And then you can interact with your environment and you swim and climb and jumping, climbing trees, that type of stuff.
Thanks for watching!
It's also coming out in the US and released in North America in June as well.
So around the same time as the movie.
Awesome.
There's going to be an update coming, well we've been talking about it for a while now, Codename Bogart, which is coming to Burnout Paradise.
It's going to be basically the next update that they have, hopefully adding this brand new island to race in and going to be part of many different updates that they're going to have for the game.
Some of the things that are going to be coming with it, including some bug fixes.
They're going to be identifying the top 10 problems that users have been facing, online functionality, balancing tweaks.
They're going to be fixing the head-on takedowns, which seemed unfair, I guess, and unrealistic.
Unfair low-speed takedowns have been removed.
and then they're going to also be of course adding you know the brand new tracks and or portions of the game and hopefully some new cars to download all this is supposed to happen April 24th so I guess a lot to happen in a day yeah and so I guess we'll have to uh stay tuned to see what that is I'm interested in it I'm actually gonna start playing the game again once it comes out but uh
Only briefly.
Burnout Paradise kind of wore out quick.
I don't think I like the open world thing.
I think I like my Burnout the way it was.
I don't like what they did to it.
I like the open world.
I'm being so hypocritical because I loved it in test drive.
Maybe that's why.
When I played Burnout, I was like, I've played this before.
It's a lot of grinding.
is what it is, because it's a lot of like, okay, you finished this many races, now you have to do it all over again to get this next license, now you gotta do it all over again.
Whereas like the crash modes and stuff like that of the older games, they provided different scenarios and stuff to play through, whereas this game
You can kind of crash anywhere, but there's only really specific spots that you're going to kind of want to go to where you can get enough points to get to the next license.
Well, Burnout Paradise is not the only game that's getting a patch this week.
Lair is also going to be getting a patch very soon.
It's coming out in Japan on April 17th.
That's probably the same day you're likely to see it everywhere else.
The biggest thing that you're getting in this patch, not just Rumble support for the new Rumble controllers coming out, the DualShock 3s, but...
Now you're going to get analog controls, finally.
You don't have to just control with the 6-axis controller.
There will be a new targeting icon that shows up, and now you can download Wind Dragon and Poison Dragon, the different types of dragons that you can use in any old stage.
I wonder if this will change people's opinions on the game, because some of the people's biggest bitch they had was the controls.
Yeah, if they fixed the controls, I'd be really interested to see how the game plays out.
I want to see some people, just some, not everybody, but some people that reviewed this game before, like re-review it.
If that makes sense.
They may, actually.
I'd be curious to see that.
Which is very interesting if a patch has that big of an impact on a game.
You know what I mean?
Well, I'll teach them to stick with the stupid motion controls.
Only, you know, they should have it as an option.
Just like Rumble.
True.
True.
Well, some good news for our friends over in the UK is that one of the retailers, Shop2, has confirmed that they are going to be selling a Grand Theft Auto 4 hardware bundle that will have the 40 gig PS3, 6-axis, and a copy of GTA 4, and it will be out on the 29th of April for £299, which is the equivalent of $590 for us.
Nice.
Any word on something like that coming over here?
Not that I've seen.
I don't work in the industry.
Are you surprised, Loki, at the lack?
I mean, I know you're big on Grand Theft Auto 4 and this is supposed to be like a system-selling type game.
I have actually heard people thinking of investing in a PlayStation 3 because they want to get Grand Theft Auto and for whatever reason there's more games on the PS3 that interest them as opposed to Xbox 360.
Why isn't Sony jumping on the opportunity over here?
I don't know.
Probably because...
and DarkSakura.
Really though, they've been having trouble keeping the systems in, I think.
Although we haven't been selling them too fast, I know.
I went to Fry's the other day and they had pallets of PS3s just sitting there.
It's not like there's a shortage of them.
It's just people need games to play on it.
I guess Grand Theft Auto will be one of those games.
It'll be one.
They'll sell systems, but at the same time, I think if people actually realize, hey, there's a lot of games on 360 as well, and it's coming out on there, but
To each his own, I guess.
Whatever their preference is.
So one thing, though, that's kind of disappointing is the PlayStation Network will be going down tomorrow for about 15 hours.
But not a big deal, because it will be coming back shortly after that with the brand new PlayStation Store.
It's going to be completely redesigned.
It's going to have a bunch of new features in there as well.
It's supposed to be a little bit easier to browse, kind of like the...
I don't know, SingStar store a little bit and some of the cool things that they're going to have on there as well hopefully the home beta will be coming out pretty soon but lots of stuff to look forward to and it's nice to see that they're actually updating their store because it was pretty hard to browse through and this looks a little bit better
Yeah, I think the PlayStation Store kind of needed some look and feel changes to it, so I hope this goes well for them.
You know what other store needs look and changes?
That fucking virtual console store needs some serious updates.
Well, going from hardcore updates and news to big old rumors, take this with a big grain of salt.
Apparently, this is coming over from Game Reactor.
Some blogger on there has said that apparently John Woo is going to announce the Metroid film at next week's Comic-Con in New York City.
Here's the deal with it.
It's going to star Christiana Loken, and she was the main actress in Blood Rain, apparently.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
but he did and he's gotten involved with video games before because there was Stranglehold right was a John Woo game as well so kind of interesting I think the release date makes this false because I think if this were true the movie would already be filming and I don't know that seems like a pretty aggressive release date to just like unless they're gonna like start filming it this summer I guess they could the release date can change I mean it's just go ahead
Also keep in mind that a lot of times, especially for projects that they're going to hype quite a bit and want to actually push out there, that they'll start filming them under a false name.
But still, just with the amount of buzz that a game like this would get, I would think that something would leak.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
I don't know.
If they're doing it all on a soundstage, who knows?
Also, all the work that they could be doing right now, could it be maybe going in reverse a little bit, doing a lot of the CG work now, and then going back and then filming the stuff and then adding the CG stuff in there?
I don't know.
There's modeling.
I would just think the special effects that a Metroid movie would take are going to take too long unless they've already been doing them.
But again, if they've already been doing them, some dude on a blog somewhere would not have been the first one to notice this.
Or it's going to really suck.
That would be sad.
That would be very sad.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura likes to dig through her collection every week and find one game to spotlight for those of you guys pay a little respect to the classic video game of the week
So DarkSakura, what classic video game have you selected for the crowd this week?
This is another one that makes my heart hurt that it's considered a classic now.
But it came out on PlayStation and it's Bust a Move.
I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble.
It came out over here as Bust a Groove because Puzzle Bobble came out as Bust a Move already and therefore had the license in the U.S.
But in Japan it was Bust a Move.
Let's take a listen.
Whoever's playing as Kitty Yen is actually doing pretty good.
And the video file that we are playing this from is actually the person playing on the mode with no commands.
I don't know if you noticed that, Rob.
Yeah, I noticed.
I was like, something's wrong with this when I was looking at it.
There's no arrows that you hit in.
Yeah, that's actually when I was at my height of playing this game, I used to play it without commands.
Because everyone has the same damn moves?
You're probably going to have to explain for our listeners how this is different from DDR.
Okay, basically what Bust a Move is, it's sort of a versus dance game where you put in the commands that it brings up on the screen and you do them, you hit your trigger button, I guess I usually call it the trigger, whatever your last command button is, to activate those moves right on the beat.
So you have to have good rhythm to make sure that you're hitting this right.
And some of the songs go from...
Super easy to super hard to just being easy and then having tricky parts.
Like this one.
In fact, at the very end of this part is where the trickiest part of the song for me is.
And as you might have just heard where it says high-scoring moves, you actually have secret moves that when it comes up to the character's solo part, if you know what that command is, then you can put in those moves and it boosts your score even more.
Um...
It has a bunch of different characters.
It had different songs each.
You had different styles.
They actually changed quite a bit, though, when the US version came out.
You had Frida, Gasso, Ham, who was the hamburger guy.
I thought he was great.
Heat, Hiro, who was the disco guy.
Kelly, who was a fetishist.
She was a slut, basically.
Kitty N, Kitty Nakajima Pinky, Stripper Shorty, Strike Burger Dog
Dance Moves, who's in Ham Stage, Capoeira, which were two silver aliens that did Capoeira-style dancing, Columbo, that was Shorty's pet mouse, and Robo-Z, who was actually the boss of the game.
And when you fight Robo-Z, Robo-Z's like really freaking tall, and you're like maybe the size of a finger.
And you're actually on top of a building and it's in the middle of the street causing accidents and wrecks.
Hey, it's Capoeira.
But Capoeira was also called Kiki and Lala, which I thought was pretty funny.
So when the game came out in the US, they... See, this is the good version, if we can turn it up a little bit.
Okay, this is, they made this song in English and it sucked.
The woman could not sing for crap.
They actually did, they edited it quite a bit.
Like, when Strike comes out, he would drink from a flask.
And they changed it to a can of Coke.
They took out Hero's Cigarette.
They changed certain lyrics for being, I guess, racially charged.
And also references to McDonald's and Burger King.
Um, they, like I said, they did some of the songs in English, which just was awful.
Oh my god.
They left Fridas in Japanese, which I don't understand.
Um, and then, um...
Also, with the stages, though, is that if you did a seven-point combo, which, you know, that was getting up to the most difficult stage of doing those special combos, you could get the levels to do, like, neat stuff.
Like, for this stage here, Capoeira stage, the doors would pop off, and you'd either be in the air or you'd be in outer space, depending.
If you play shorty and pull one off, her mouse jumps out of her pocket and starts dancing with her.
This game is so... It's just really one of my... Okay, I first played this when someone brought over their copy.
It had only been like a week in Japan.
And I imported it as soon as Payday hit.
I know this bugs you when I call it this, but Bust a Move 2 was my first rhythm game ever here in the U.S.
And without that game, I probably would not be here on Orange Lounge Radio today.
So I totally love this series as well.
Best of Move 2 and the reason why I'm not really combining them is because actually Best of Move 2 to me is sort of a different game because each character had their own set of special commands instead of having everyone having the same move which is why you can play Best of Move in
without the commands because everybody had the same damn commands.
And I actually had one of the first English fan sites on this game and it's gone.
It's been dead, but the link is still on the anime web turnpike if that's any indication of how long I've had that site.
Fever time.
Yeah.
When a new character does really well, they get to bust out a solo.
It's pretty awesome.
And the endings are funny too.
But Busted Move 2 had individual moves for everybody.
It had easy mode, which it was all just using commands with the arrows.
You had the medium mode, which plays pretty much just like the first Busted Move.
And then you had mix mode, which uses the triangle score and everything.
And you also had attacks too, which if you timed your attack just right, you could completely botch their entire solo.
Now, really quickly here, before we go to break, because we've got to kind of wrap this segment up, why do you think this series kind of died off?
Because, you know, we had these games, we had Dance Summit, which was kind of meh.
I love Dance Summit!
It's just, it wasn't really the same.
Why did this series, why haven't we seen more games in this series, especially with how popular music games have been in this day and age?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thank you for watching!
They really tried to innovate the series, and I thought that Buster Move 2 was going in the right direction, but they haven't done anything else with it.
I think that maybe because of how poorly Dance Summit did, that maybe they thought that it was just time to end the series.
I don't know.
Sad.
But what they need to do is go back and do another one that plays like Buster Move 2.
Alright, we gotta wrap up, but that is your classic game of the week, folks.
It is Bust a Move.
How can you not like a game that has a gigantic voguing robot?
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I guess that is true.
Real quickly, Qualtipo in chat asked, what could they put in a Buster Groove sequel?
Honestly, just more of the same on next gen.
Online, Xbox Live.
Get rid of bio, bring back gaso.
Here's a great Xbox... What a great Xbox Live Arcade game this might make.
See, that would be good.
And you know what they should have, I think?
They should have... You know, you can do creative mode... You know, in wrestling games, you can do create a wrestler and customize all of their moves, every single one based on what you put.
All you have to do is have a creative dancer mode and you'd give them different combo moves or give them a style of dance and...
All right.
I think that that should come out.
Another dream game!
