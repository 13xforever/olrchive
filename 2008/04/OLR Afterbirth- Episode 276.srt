1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:05,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:14,295
[SPEAKER_00]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

3
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:26,379
[SPEAKER_00]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,780
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next week!

5
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:59,564
[SPEAKER_02]: And welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, where we always start off with a ritual saving of Part B, ever since the Part B to that one episode a couple weeks ago was lost forever.

6
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:02,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight on the afterbirth, sadly, I believe Jamie is leaving us.

7
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:05,349
[SPEAKER_02]: She has another commitment she's got to get to early in the morning.

8
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:06,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called work.

9
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,993
[SPEAKER_02]: She did will us a cage match pick, so we'll be taking care of that for her.

10
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,157
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, we have another edition of...

11
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret Club Secret Club Secret Club

12
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:44,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that if you hear it here on this program, great, you're in the know, but you don't go posting about it to websites saying, hey, I heard it on OrangeLawnTrader.com or I heard it on AllAllGames.com because we're at this point.

13
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:50,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to be that way where we were like, hey, you know, it makes our EP-ness bigger when OLR brings you the exclusive.

14
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:53,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we got the smackdown that one time and it's just kind of like, you know what, fuck it.

15
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:56,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to start Secret Club and start giving out secrets.

16
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,386
[SPEAKER_02]: KONAMI TITLES

17
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:30,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And this isn't a big surprise with each year seeing a new release of certain games that we'd be seeing an announcement for something that hasn't quite been announced yet.

18
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:35,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Brand new DDR game coming to the PlayStation 2.

19
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Although right now the title has got me a little confused.

20
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:44,306
[SPEAKER_10]: DDRX or Dance Dance Revolution X.

21
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,248
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

22
00:02:58,674 --> 00:02:59,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it their 10th release, maybe?

23
00:03:00,775 --> 00:03:01,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

24
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:08,702
[SPEAKER_10]: If you add all the games together from PlayStation 1... No, because Extreme was the 8th one, and then there would have been... Extreme 2, Supernova, and Supernova 2.

25
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:09,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

26
00:03:09,382 --> 00:03:09,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, alright.

27
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:10,964
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

28
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they just ran out of funky titles for it, I guess.

29
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:14,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

30
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:17,009
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Hottest Part 2, of course, because, you know...

31
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,232
[SPEAKER_02]: AJ Mix says X is for 10th anniversary.

32
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:23,132
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thought.

33
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Because 98 was the first year of DDR, hence the song.

34
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:27,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

35
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:27,995
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

36
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:29,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Props to you, AJ.

37
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,438
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Lost in Blue coming to the Wii as well.

38
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:35,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost in Blue on the Wii?

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,381
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can be bored out of my mind on the Wii too?

40
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:38,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

41
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:43,739
[SPEAKER_10]: and then totally on a different topic here.

42
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:54,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Got some more news talking about the whole... Remember a while back we were talking about the whole Gibson suing Activision and Harmonix for Guitar Hero?

43
00:03:55,424 --> 00:04:00,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's interesting because people were speculating, oh, it's probably over money or something like that.

44
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:05,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this might clear it up and you'd be surprised.

45
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:09,570
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually... This was an email that we got from...

46
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:20,068
[SPEAKER_10]: As you may know, Activision is involved in litigation with Gibson Guitar Corporation relating to the sales of Guitar Hero games.

47
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:28,779
[SPEAKER_10]: In connection with such, Gibson has asserted to Activision that Gibson has the exclusive right to sell Guitar Hero games to music specialty stores.

48
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:50,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Such as Guitar Center stores Although Activision does not agree with Gibson on this issue Until this issue is resolved with Gibson, Activision is requesting that its distributors refrain from selling Guitar Hero games to any music specialty store So that sounds like it's over money After all, and not some sort of patent infringement

49
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we all kind of guessed that, to be honest.

50
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:57,285
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it that way, but I think we all kind of did.

51
00:04:57,305 --> 00:05:02,389
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, is this really a big surprise, brand new DDR game coming out for the PlayStation 2 this year?

52
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:04,291
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, what, there's like one every year anyways?

53
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:06,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

54
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:06,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

55
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:08,215
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's a surprise to you, then...

56
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

57
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:48,933
[SPEAKER_10]: but typically those games though, if I remember last year, Supernova 2 and Hottest Party came out in September and then the Xbox 360 one came out in November so it might just not be announced yet, that may be too far ahead but I don't know how well they've done

58
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,315
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, now with that said, I've got to find a cage match to pick.

59
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:54,895
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, yeah, you better look for that.

60
00:05:55,536 --> 00:05:58,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you, everybody, for participating in another week of Secret Class.

61
00:05:58,517 --> 00:06:04,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I like sharing this stuff with you guys, but I like having a job, too, so please keep it that way.

62
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,380
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we'll see what happens.

63
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:10,942
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I guess at this point we do get into the cage.

64
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking I might have one more thing for Secret Club tonight.

65
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,393
[SPEAKER_10]: You should play this thing that we posted.

66
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:22,314
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that Separated at Birth, We Fit Balance Board and Aperture Science Turret.

67
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I didn't want to do it because it was audio.

68
00:06:25,515 --> 00:06:26,315
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see if I can get that.

69
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go to the forums real quick.

70
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny.

71
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:36,598
[SPEAKER_02]: After birth part of the show, I don't have to be as professional.

72
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:37,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Where was it here?

73
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the show role in the Super Secret Forum.

74
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, it was We...

75
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:43,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Deploying.

76
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:46,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Target lost.

77
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still there?

78
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:48,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Hibernating.

79
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:38,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like just another stupid Wii voice to me.

80
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

81
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I see the similarities.

82
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:44,845
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that.

83
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:50,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I can give you one more thing for Secret Club.

84
00:07:52,483 --> 00:07:58,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Dodgeball and Virtual Console at some point in the not too distant future.

85
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't see that.

86
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:00,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

87
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with River City Ransom just coming out.

88
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,628
[SPEAKER_10]: That and Super Dodgeball Brawlers, I think that's what it was called.

89
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Dodgeball Brawlers or something like that.

90
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That was coming to DS at the end of next month.

91
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:14,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes sense.

92
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:19,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just waiting for that Wii Fit thing in that little high-pitched voice to go, Measuring!

93
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Measuring!

94
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:20,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Measuring!

95
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:21,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Measuring.

96
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:23,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Still measuring.

97
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:24,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Goddamn, you're fat.

98
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop eating, piggy.

99
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:28,786
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

100
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have ourselves an OLR cage match.

101
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:47,041
[SPEAKER_02]: The way the cage match works, three songs go in and do battle, and the winning song, well, it doesn't go into rotation anymore because it's not our station, but it does win the praise and admiration of all of our listeners, and some type of consolation prize will come up with in the future.

102
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, let's discuss the three songs doing battle tonight.

103
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It's last week's winner versus Two New People.

104
00:08:54,474 --> 00:08:56,896
[SPEAKER_02]: or songs, I should say, brought in from OLR hosts.

105
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week in the Orange Launch Radio cage match, believe it or not, I won.

106
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:06,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won with a little band called Spray, who was famous for the song I Am Gothic in DDR years ago.

107
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:15,167
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a cover of the song Run With Us, which was the theme song to the raccoons, but they made it sound like initial, or not initial D, Wankia Midnight Maximum tune.

108
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:17,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Like imagine mixing your favorite 80s cartoon

109
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:19,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the raccoon is probably top nobody's list.

110
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,552
[SPEAKER_02]: With Wham Gam Midnight next to the tune.

111
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:22,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get this song.

112
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:23,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all kinds of awesome.

113
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:25,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chatroom voted it as their favorite too.

114
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:26,997
[SPEAKER_02]: It's song number one tonight.

115
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:29,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Spray with Run With Us.

116
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, you only get a clip because it did win last week.

117
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:52,245
[SPEAKER_02]: That was song number one on the single, which is available on iTunes.

118
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:52,866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

119
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,328
[SPEAKER_02]: The Raccoons, Run With Us by Sprite.

120
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:06,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, song number two tonight is brought to you by Jamie.

121
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:18,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though she's not here and sadly can't take your FUs either, so off the table until next week, she thought, gee, I had so much luck with Mindless Self-Indulgence the other week, I think I'll try it again and see if lightning strikes twice.

122
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:20,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So she brings this song to you guys tonight.

123
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:24,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a song called Shut Me Up, which we've managed to do tonight by her leaving early.

124
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut Me Up by Mindless Self-Indulgence.

125
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is, song number two tonight.

126
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two is Mindless Self-Indulgence with Shut Me Up.

127
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:31,288
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you think of that song, Loki?

128
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:32,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

129
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I've listened to a few other things.

130
00:14:34,192 --> 00:14:36,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had the Blender CDs at one time.

131
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:38,938
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

132
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:39,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of it's alright.

133
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,983
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd like to say it's a six.

134
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:48,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um, I don't know, it was okay.

135
00:14:49,943 --> 00:14:53,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I liked her first, the other song better, a lot better.

136
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it was because it was a remix, I don't know.

137
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,610
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have a, it wasn't bad.

138
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably play that in rock band once just to say I did.

139
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give it like a, I'll give it a six.

140
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:06,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, song number three comes from you, and you have to remind me what the file name is called.

141
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:08,237
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't find it.

142
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:11,081
[SPEAKER_10]: This song is a remix of a Daft Punk song.

143
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:16,729
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops Edit.

144
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:20,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And I guess it's sort of like a hardcore remix of it.

145
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Like a little bit faster.

146
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:25,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

147
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:29,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Not my type of music per se, but it was interesting.

148
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:35,753
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't like the Kanye West butchering of this song, then maybe you'll like this butchering of the song.

149
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

150
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:39,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Daft Punk, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops Mix.

151
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:40,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

152
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:05,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Daft Punk, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops remix.

153
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:06,889
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of that, Loki?

154
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:09,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was okay.

155
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:11,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

156
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:13,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Daft Punk, so it's a seven.

157
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:17,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was okay too, but I kind of like the original better.

158
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:20,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing beats that Around the World song ever.

159
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
[SPEAKER_02]: That song was the best thing ever.

160
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:26,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the ones that did their live thing with those two songs combined together.

161
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:27,582
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool.

162
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I give that a 6 as well.

163
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in the cage match.

164
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:36,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all starts with song number one, last week's winner.

165
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,066
[SPEAKER_02]: You can vote for this one.

166
00:19:38,106 --> 00:19:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's song number one, Run With Us by Spray.

167
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Shut Me Up by Mindless Self Indulgence.

168
00:20:00,256 --> 00:20:05,243
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Daft Punk with Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops Mix.

169
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,873
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, send your votes now.

170
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:16,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Place vote now.

171
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:23,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we'll tally them up here shortly and reveal a winner.

172
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, it has to be chat.orangeonradio.com.

173
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,842
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in the all games chat, I guess you could still send me a private message.

174
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:38,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll still count it, but we don't really tend to watch the all games chat just because having me watch three chat rooms between that and Justin TV is a little bit much.

175
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:40,328
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit much.

176
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:42,146
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

177
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:45,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you've got to help me fill time here, buddy, while I count votes.

178
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,867
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no Jamie tonight to read FUs, so help.

179
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:50,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

180
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:51,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just looking at something.

181
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:56,369
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of weird that our page got deleted so fast on Wikipedia.

182
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:57,329
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm talking about.

183
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:58,589
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't even bother to do a –

184
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:15,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do it, but somebody should recreate it from a cache file.

185
00:21:15,094 --> 00:21:17,575
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the problem with the old one, it sourced nothing.

186
00:21:17,895 --> 00:21:22,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might want to source those YouTubes that have us on the news and stuff.

187
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:24,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we were in the paper once.

188
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:25,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you can still get that article on the internet.

189
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:26,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

190
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:30,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they did a speedy deletion, which is meant for stuff that –

191
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:51,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, basically, you know, pages, I'm trying to see here To be honest, it's not that much of a surprise, but it does bruise the ego a little bit, especially when it's been up there for like two years Well, and this guy, I don't know what he does, I mean, he seems to be working on stuff that's mainly just like chemical warfare and shit like that, you know, those kind of articles, like

192
00:21:51,585 --> 00:22:02,613
[SPEAKER_10]: His were, like, you know, he did beer, there's some, like, different, you know, blister agent, blood agent, um, you know, Brazilian wandering spider, just, like, all sorts of random shit.

193
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:08,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why this guy, just wandering around Wikipedia, oh, I don't like you, delete, you know.

194
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Go delete his shit.

195
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:12,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

196
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,504
[SPEAKER_10]: But, whatever, I mean...

197
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,120
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

198
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:43,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Two weeks in a row.

199
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:45,213
[SPEAKER_02]: The raccoons.

200
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,374
[SPEAKER_02]: People love the raccoons.

201
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three was close.

202
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:50,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, not that close.

203
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It only had about half the votes number one did.

204
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two kind of ate the dust of the other two songs, I'm sorry to say.

205
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,744
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what happens because Jamie wasn't here to really defend it.

206
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:02,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, she can't tell you guys why to vote for it.

207
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,769
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brings us to the very, very end.

208
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a fortune cookie message left, and we're going to call it a night here on All Games Radio.

209
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,881
[SPEAKER_02]: and Orange Lounge Radio.

210
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:18,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll get to the fortune cookie message, but really quick, any last minute things we need to say?

211
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:20,407
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no Justin TV tonight, guys.

212
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:21,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, we don't have a game to show you tonight.

213
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:22,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe next week.

214
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:24,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I left my Wii at work anyways.

215
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:27,630
[SPEAKER_02]: They were wanting to see Metal Gear Online, but you're not even in that beta, are you?

216
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a code.

217
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:31,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't tried it yet, though.

218
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:37,094
[SPEAKER_10]: See, there was that story, and I forgot to read it, about people that were getting... They figured out, hey, guess what?

219
00:23:37,114 --> 00:23:40,495
[SPEAKER_10]: People are going in through the Japanese one, and they start banning people off there.

220
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:43,337
[SPEAKER_10]: I never got an email, though, saying that my thing was...

221
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,574
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

222
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:06,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Something to do this week.

223
00:24:07,007 --> 00:24:12,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have to send back one of my broken 360s to get it replaced.

224
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:17,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought a label online with the security labels, and we'll put it back on there and see if they catch it.

225
00:24:18,562 --> 00:24:23,969
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have another one I've got to sell back because we don't have six people to play anymore, so I'm going to just take it down to five.

226
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:25,679
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

227
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:38,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I've got to get two more copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 because I'm only going to have two right now at launch because I have my pre-ordered one and then my boss pre-ordered me a special edition that they're going to pay for.

228
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:40,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

229
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's almost 10 o'clock or 1 a.m.

00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:48,707

[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys.

273
00:27:52,951 --> 00:28:08,111
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that reminds me, though, because my friend Amanda is listening right now, and we were in college together, and we actually used to go to Burger King and collect the toys from the old school Pokemon because we were trying so hard to get the cool little Pikachu doll.

274
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,113
[SPEAKER_02]: and little fucker never showed up.

275
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:13,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We always got the little crappy one that looked like a turd.

276
00:28:13,155 --> 00:28:14,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a cave Pokemon.

277
00:28:14,336 --> 00:28:15,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the name of it.

278
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:16,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure some of you hardcore people know.

279
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:18,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I just remember collecting that stuff.

280
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:18,960
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so funny.

281
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I remember we went to go see the Pokemon first movie in the theater on the big screen when it opened.
