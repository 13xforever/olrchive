Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:19.680 --> 00:24.400
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio for this part B of our podcast

00:24.400 --> 00:28.920
We now tape live on all games.com every Sunday night. We got a small little crowd

00:28.920 --> 00:32.440
Hello to everybody in our chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com

00:32.800 --> 00:37.820
Who are listening to us and our brand new sound quality as well lots of compliments on the sound of the show tonight

00:38.240 --> 00:42.560
We're excited to be here. We got lots more stuff for you in part B more gaming news

00:42.560 --> 00:45.800
We have the mailbag we're giving away a stupid award tonight

00:45.800 --> 00:52.240
And we've got an interview with somebody pretty rad of Farb's the man behind Rom check fail will be talking to him very shortly

00:52.720 --> 00:54.840
but first more gaming news

00:54.840 --> 00:58.400
Yes, loki. Yes, all right anyways

00:59.880 --> 01:02.660
So this is not big surprise because we've been

01:03.400 --> 01:10.520
Seeing sorts of similar bands with other rock star games, but this time brazil has banned bully

01:11.600 --> 01:18.500
Of course you know before the whole banning problem was manhunt 2 now for whatever reason they've deemed it

01:20.200 --> 01:22.200
inappropriate for sale and

01:22.200 --> 01:29.640
The ban has prevented the game from being imported distributed sold or promoted on the websites and stores in the country

01:30.680 --> 01:33.280
apparently Brazilian distributors retailers

01:34.080 --> 01:38.880
will have 30 days to comply with the ban and it came in response to

01:39.680 --> 01:48.160
The requests of the Brazilian youth center it said the aggravating factor is that everything in the game takes place inside a school

01:48.160 --> 01:49.080
and

01:49.080 --> 01:50.200
that's

01:50.200 --> 01:52.200
not acceptable, so

01:52.800 --> 01:54.800
apparently of course take two has

01:55.840 --> 02:00.440
They said it will not have a material impact on the sales of their popular title

02:02.160 --> 02:04.640
Doesn't sound like that. They're going to appeal it, so

02:05.800 --> 02:09.960
You're in brazil and you want to play bully. Oh well guess you're out of luck

02:09.960 --> 02:15.600
You might have to import it or something huh not that I don't think you're missing a whole lot, but you know

02:15.600 --> 02:21.360
Now what's weird to me this game is somewhat old, so are we talking like all the way back to the PlayStation 2 version?

02:21.360 --> 02:23.360
No, this is a scholarship edition

02:23.560 --> 02:28.720
So it's stupid though because the game has been out. I was going to say the game's already been out, so what's the big difference?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.280
It's not like this games like an M rated game or anything

02:31.280 --> 02:36.560
This is like a teen rated game over here, so I don't understand what the big deal is. Oh, it's this school

02:36.560 --> 02:38.960
Oh, that's why oh, I'm sorry

02:39.520 --> 02:45.060
It's a school. Did you actually play they haven't played the game? They didn't see like what contents in the game

02:45.060 --> 02:49.380
They're just oh because it's cool and bullies in tile must be because you're a bully and

02:50.360 --> 02:55.280
So we don't like it. I'd be curious to hear and I know we've got to have some listeners in Brazil

02:55.280 --> 02:57.000
I got because we got listeners from around the world

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I'd be kind of curious to hear this from their perspective

02:59.360 --> 03:03.000
And I want to know can you go walk in to you know your big game stores there?

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
I mean, I don't know if you have the same type of things we do only have 30 days to comply so go quick

03:07.640 --> 03:13.560
I'm curious. Can you walk into a store and buy bully on the PlayStation 2 or have you been able to do that in the past?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.560
That's why I'm kind of curious about so

03:16.240 --> 03:20.280
We'll see. I don't know dark soccer. What do you think about banning video games in countries?

03:21.800 --> 03:27.640
Retarded yeah, I mean is there I I think that banning anything is

03:31.720 --> 03:38.800
Unless we're banning the ferret. No just kidding. I I understand to an extent why people

03:39.480 --> 03:41.620
Why things are illegal you know why?

03:41.620 --> 03:43.500
certain

03:43.500 --> 03:46.220
Things that they think might be harmful to the development of children

03:46.220 --> 03:50.580
But you know I believe that it's not the government's place to decide. It's the parents place to decide I

03:51.900 --> 03:56.260
Guess despite all our I guess despite all our bitching in part a about the way society is right now

03:56.260 --> 03:59.260
I guess we should be thankful where we live in a place where at least we have that decision to make

03:59.460 --> 04:04.000
Where you don't see the country banning things if they'll just give a shit for it. Oh well, yeah

04:05.020 --> 04:10.500
So all right well moving on to other you know I don't know if I'd would call this happy news

04:10.500 --> 04:13.620
I don't think it's really happy for these people that we're working at develop

04:14.380 --> 04:16.380
develop was a gaming company and

04:16.500 --> 04:23.420
Unfortunately they have just lost some projects because the staff was cut from 25 down to just six senior staff

04:24.580 --> 04:27.540
President Michael scandizzo though says I guess he's optimistic

04:27.540 --> 04:30.700
He says if somebody came in tomorrow and said here's a whole bunch of money

04:30.700 --> 04:35.340
Can you get back up and running then by Monday we could be at back up and running it would have to be soon

04:35.340 --> 04:36.900
But if anybody wanted to come in and save us

04:36.900 --> 04:40.640
We'd give the whole kitchen sink to them to them on the extremely cheap

04:40.860 --> 04:45.060
Otherwise after almost 10 years of this group working together. We're going to have to dissolve

04:45.780 --> 04:49.760
Developed was formed in 2003 and it was a bunch of people that used to work for Blizzard

04:50.100 --> 04:54.220
But here's here's the punchline the only game that's come out of develop

04:54.780 --> 04:56.780
Yaris

04:57.500 --> 05:03.260
So if you were hoping for Yaris to I don't know if that's really gonna happen now

05:03.260 --> 05:09.020
I guess I kind of feel bad for these guys though because they were they were probably paid a crap load of money for what?

05:09.020 --> 05:11.980
Couldn't have been a too difficult a game. They might have had all these other projects

05:11.980 --> 05:15.900
We'll never know about that could have been pretty rad and they couldn't get one, right?

05:17.980 --> 05:22.100
But I mean it was Yaris come on Yaris too, then you're probably a masochist

05:23.420 --> 05:26.460
Well, I don't know a juiced in and chat says let them die

05:26.460 --> 05:33.240
I chat that orange songs radio.com if you want to participate can't save them all I guess that's true. Don't worry

05:33.240 --> 05:35.240
EA is hiring right just kidding

05:36.640 --> 05:38.860
Anyway, can I get can I yes, you have some good news

05:39.380 --> 05:44.360
We actually have a video now of a new character for Street Fighter 4

05:44.700 --> 05:49.620
Who is named Rufus and he's actually bigger than e Honda

05:49.620 --> 05:55.580
And he's supposedly really fast for being bigger than e Honda so

05:57.380 --> 05:59.820
Interesting there's also another character called el fuerte

06:02.260 --> 06:06.060
Who is supposed to be just a overall playable character

06:06.060 --> 06:11.980
I don't really see anything though about how the character moves. He's a Mexican wrestler. Hey, that's cool

06:11.980 --> 06:16.820
I like I like the luchadors. He's actually pretty fast. I've watched some gameplay footage of

06:16.820 --> 06:18.260
him

06:18.260 --> 06:23.980
Now Rufus, so that guy is he's pretty fat. He kind of reminds me a lot of oh

06:24.700 --> 06:29.220
God, who is the character that they just added in Tekken 6 the one that was really like Bob?

06:29.500 --> 06:35.420
Yeah, it kind of looks like Bob but with like a ponytail and just like he's got amazing

06:36.820 --> 06:39.880
Gut physics. He looks like Jack Black and nacho libre

06:39.880 --> 06:47.240
DJ janae in chat says king hippo is the king of fat dude characters and games. Yes true statement

06:47.520 --> 06:49.520
Whatever happened to king hippo. Oh

06:49.600 --> 06:55.380
Okay, so I'm looking at this el fuerte. Mm-hmm, and he's actually pretty cool

06:56.960 --> 07:04.120
He fights very much in a from sort of a vega style I'm thinking but it is very

07:04.120 --> 07:12.480
Yeah, dark Tetsuya and Chad it throws back to another Capcom classic says he reminds me of one of the characters in slam masters

07:12.600 --> 07:16.440
Remember Saturday night slam masters. Oh my god. This guy is it was fun

07:17.080 --> 07:22.320
Hideously fast. He actually surmised me. Who was that guy from art of fighting that would throw cookies. Oh

07:23.400 --> 07:27.100
God, I don't remember where the green outfit and suspenders. No, that was a

07:27.100 --> 07:34.300
That was that was Chang that was a fatal fury fatal. Fury was hairy was named Chang. Yeah something something

07:34.300 --> 07:36.300
Yeah, I know you're talking about

07:36.380 --> 07:42.020
Yes, he threw cookies Rufus is kind of like if I kept eating and eating and eating and eating then became a fighter

07:42.340 --> 07:47.540
He he he he has jiggle. He has belly jiggle

07:48.420 --> 07:50.260
Don't you see?

07:50.260 --> 07:52.260
He looks like pom-pom in

07:52.260 --> 07:58.060
A home star runner. All right, a lot lots of diverse characters apparently coming to Street Fighter 4

07:58.060 --> 08:01.700
I'm kind of excited by this. It sounds like there's a lot of people in Street Fighter 4

08:01.700 --> 08:04.660
I mean not only do you have the original fighters and I have some of these new people too

08:04.660 --> 08:07.700
We have the crevice and Viper, you know other people we've heard about in previous shows

08:07.700 --> 08:12.980
So Street Fighter 4 is gonna be a good time. Yeah, I hope now the question but the question is will it blend?

08:13.220 --> 08:17.260
Well, it blends maybe I don't know if Rufus can fit in the blender

08:17.260 --> 08:22.420
Now this is interesting and you know, once again goes to show you that

08:23.420 --> 08:25.900
The Sony platforms are just not

08:26.900 --> 08:28.900
Not that safe against hackers

08:29.500 --> 08:32.220
Apparently though there's been a tool that's been developed

08:32.740 --> 08:38.640
called ps3 proxy and what this program has done is actually allowed people to

08:38.640 --> 08:46.480
Be able to download the PlayStation home beta without actually having to participate in the beta. So they're able to

08:48.280 --> 08:54.720
Modify a few files that they've downloaded from a server to allow them to download the beta even though it's not available to them

08:55.880 --> 09:00.320
Word is right now though that you're unable to actually play the beta

09:00.720 --> 09:04.840
But there has been some video of people that have been able to play the beta

09:04.840 --> 09:08.960
Despite the fact that it was previously thought you couldn't but either way though

09:09.200 --> 09:12.960
The thought is that it's gonna be public pretty soon anyways

09:13.360 --> 09:17.560
So might as well just wait a few weeks, you know for it to come out

09:17.560 --> 09:22.140
But in the meantime though, it's very interesting though that you can download it as it you know

09:23.640 --> 09:28.700
It's not that difficult from what I was reading into I just haven't gone around to actually trying it yet

09:28.700 --> 09:35.140
Where is freaking home already? I mean they've been talking about this for over a year now, you know

09:35.140 --> 09:37.580
And we have yet to really see much more than screenshots

09:38.220 --> 09:44.020
Well, that's it's probably hanging out with spore and I'm sorry, but that's the same do them forever

09:44.020 --> 09:49.700
You know what PlayStation I have you know, and I'm not gonna just dig on place, you know

09:49.700 --> 09:57.060
Sony with this but the PlayStation 3 they've been like touting a lot of features as they say they haven't arrived yet like home

09:57.060 --> 10:03.800
You know, there are new games like hell mill yourself for even going as far as like Final Fantasy 13

10:04.020 --> 10:07.740
Which is not scheduled to be out here for a few years now

10:08.740 --> 10:13.020
It's just like stuff like this. They're like, oh, hey. Yeah, this says it's coming like coming

10:13.020 --> 10:16.000
It's right around the corner, but really it's not right around the corner

10:16.660 --> 10:20.780
You know and even Microsoft's kind of guilty of this too with the whole XNA thing

10:20.780 --> 10:23.660
Yeah, that's cool that they showed us that little snippet around

10:23.660 --> 10:31.180
You know game developers conference in that kind of time, but once it actually coming out not for a while

10:31.740 --> 10:36.340
So that's kind of lame and then you know with Nintendo and the whole WiiWare service

10:36.340 --> 10:40.900
Yeah, they've been teasing that for a long time and I good point. I guess it's not just Sony

10:40.900 --> 10:46.920
It's just easy to pick on Sony for whatever reason. Well, yeah, but at least they've given us a date on WiiWare of sorts

10:47.780 --> 10:50.700
Yeah, I guess I could always put it back. I don't think they will this one

10:50.700 --> 10:55.420
I mean WiiWare is out now in Japan it is out. But what's the kind of release schedule? What are we looking at?

10:55.420 --> 11:00.700
Okay, they release like say eight games or something. How many months do we have to wait for the next games that come out?

11:00.700 --> 11:03.700
I mean, it's not like a typical Nintendo timeframes

11:03.700 --> 11:08.820
Not like live arcade where three months for a B title another three months for a B title in about nine months

11:08.820 --> 11:10.820
You'll get your a-list title

11:11.780 --> 11:14.180
We have a spider in the studio and it's driving me crazy

11:14.180 --> 11:19.900
I need Loki to do something about that or you are you bug phobic step on it kill it

11:19.900 --> 11:23.500
You know what? I hate worse than spiders. What's that? Mosquito Hawks?

11:24.340 --> 11:27.300
That's what we get for having that door open to get some of the cool air in here

11:28.860 --> 11:34.380
Mosquito Hawks that moment of total randomness brought to you by orange lounge radio back to the gaming news

11:34.380 --> 11:38.140
And we are one less spider in the studio. Sorry spider

11:39.380 --> 11:40.540
Sega

11:40.540 --> 11:44.560
things things aren't too good at Sega sadly Sega Racing Studio has

11:45.500 --> 11:49.660
Closed they're gone. They had more than 60 employees at one point

11:49.660 --> 11:54.020
They've really only created one title since they formed in 2005

11:55.020 --> 11:56.100
Sega closed it

11:56.100 --> 11:59.720
There was this comment that Sega gave to next-gen quote

11:59.720 --> 12:06.380
the decision is part of a review of Sega's Western Development Studios to ensure that each studio is profitable entity in its own right and

12:06.700 --> 12:13.460
Unfortunately, the Sega Racing Studios five-year plan would not result in a successful return for the Sega business moving forward

12:13.460 --> 12:18.180
Or you could probably just look at the sales of Sega rally revo because that's the one game they made

12:18.180 --> 12:20.500
and sadly, I I think it was just

12:21.460 --> 12:28.260
Especially in racing. It's so competitive right now with these next-gen systems. There are so many racing games out there right now, right?

12:28.260 --> 12:32.420
I mean look at what they have on you know, these next-gen systems, you know

12:32.420 --> 12:37.860
They got it's just on the Xbox 360. You had games like full auto test drive for za

12:38.820 --> 12:43.700
Burnout I can go on and on for a dirt, you know, just tons and tons of racing games

12:43.780 --> 12:45.780
This is just a very competitive market

12:45.780 --> 12:52.540
So that's that's two studios closed in a week sad both racing games. Mm-hmm

12:53.220 --> 12:56.180
Yaris was a game. Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't really call Yaris

12:56.180 --> 12:58.420
I wouldn't put that quite on the same level as Sega

12:58.540 --> 13:02.820
But it's just kind of like potential you would think potential by the way going back to something

13:02.820 --> 13:04.460
We were bringing up a little bit earlier

13:04.460 --> 13:10.740
I know I'm a little late on this but the Rob D is a fighting game guru and he said the character green guy throws cookies

13:11.020 --> 13:13.020
Chang's Shinzan that was it

13:13.020 --> 13:19.420
Chang's Shinzan. There it is. Couldn't remember the full name. We had a fatal fury special at my school

13:19.420 --> 13:22.160
I never played Chang anyway, it was all about Kim kap won

13:23.300 --> 13:28.420
Actually, I have to agree with you. It was him and my were always the ones I'd use and Yuri's butt attack

13:29.300 --> 13:31.300
She had butt attack and that was great

13:31.380 --> 13:34.540
Any character who attacks with her butt except there is a fighting game

13:34.860 --> 13:40.200
That has a character that fights with her butt and the game kind of sucked and that was the Sailor Moon super s fighting game

13:40.200 --> 13:44.340
So which is which was the first game I've ever imported

13:45.040 --> 13:51.120
It was a Sailor Moon fighting game. Nice. Very nice. So now that we have this little tidbit about me

13:52.440 --> 13:55.600
Going back over as far as the rumor mill is concerned

13:57.240 --> 14:00.040
There has been rumored a a

14:01.520 --> 14:02.600
New

14:02.600 --> 14:04.840
Ace attorney game to be coming out

14:04.840 --> 14:11.520
Um that has been called um, Gakuten Saiban perfect prosecutor and it should be starring

14:12.280 --> 14:13.600
Edgeworth

14:13.600 --> 14:14.840
objection

14:14.840 --> 14:16.840
overruled

14:17.640 --> 14:20.480
Well, you said it was a rumor so I thought I would object but I

14:21.520 --> 14:26.520
You know these people that love the ace attorney series love the ace attorney series

14:26.520 --> 14:30.040
I have a friend who is sucked into the series. There's like manga and everything

14:30.040 --> 14:35.820
Yeah, um, but um, they're actually the it came across from some scans in Famitsu

14:37.000 --> 14:42.520
So, um, you're you remember Shane used to come on this program a bit a long time ago. I don't remember mr.

14:42.520 --> 14:48.120
High musical I'm reminding the listeners right me glattov so and so on who used to work in on mr. High school music

14:48.120 --> 14:52.760
Okay, he played he plays World of Warcraft with us, right and he joins ventrilo the chatting

14:52.760 --> 14:57.040
You know how like in ventrilo whenever it joins you have that little robotic voice that says, you know

14:57.040 --> 15:02.680
Rob has joined the server you can put in whatever you know name you want his thing whenever he joins the server goes

15:02.800 --> 15:05.200
Apollo justice is sexy has connected

15:06.960 --> 15:11.640
Just cracks me up, but I'm telling you people that are really into Apollo justice are really into it

15:11.720 --> 15:18.100
Hey something a lot of us are into this week is rom check fail a couple weeks ago a little independent game called a rom

15:18.100 --> 15:24.680
Check fail swept gaming blogs everywhere rom check fail takes several classic video games such as Super Mario Brothers

15:24.680 --> 15:30.520
Asteroids pac-man throws them all into a blender basically resulting in unique and nostalgic

15:31.000 --> 15:34.840
Gameplay basically kind of what you do in this game. Is that one minute you might be

15:35.600 --> 15:40.000
Zelda in a Mario level and you're trying to stab the asteroids with your sword

15:40.000 --> 15:43.680
It would be link, but then the next minute well, you know what I mean, but then the next minute you are

15:44.480 --> 15:48.280
You're you're in the asteroids level and then suddenly you're pac-man

15:48.280 --> 15:52.520
You have to find the dot on the screen to eat the things from kicks are flying around the screen

15:52.520 --> 15:56.420
But when you find it they turn into blue ghosts. It's excellent. I love it

15:56.720 --> 16:01.200
The man behind rom check fail is Farb's and we got in touch with him this week

16:01.200 --> 16:06.760
And we're excited to have him on the show tonight, so let's go to the phones all the way to Australia

16:07.800 --> 16:12.280
Where Farb's is from let's get him on the line all right. Hello Farb's are you there?

16:13.120 --> 16:15.620
Hi, yeah, hey, how you doing Farb's?

16:15.620 --> 16:18.620
I'm not bad not bad all right

16:19.760 --> 16:23.260
So you're the guy that wrote rom check fail was this is was it a solo effort

16:23.260 --> 16:25.620
Did you do this all yourself or how did this happen?

16:26.660 --> 16:28.740
Yeah, yeah, no usually I work alone um

16:29.420 --> 16:35.340
It's just easier that way coordinating the project between multiple people way too hard especially when you want to do something a bit silly

16:35.620 --> 16:37.900
How long did it take you to do the whole thing?

16:38.580 --> 16:43.620
Well, I'm not sure if you saw but it was part of the video game named generator contest over

16:43.620 --> 16:48.060
So so the whole thing had to be completed in three weeks, which is why it's it's pretty small game

16:48.060 --> 16:52.180
But you know that's why wow it's very impressive considering. It was done in three weeks

16:52.180 --> 16:56.540
I I had heard it was it was like the the winner didn't you end up winning that competition too? I?

16:57.420 --> 17:02.660
Did I did so well congratulations? Well well deserved how did it get from?

17:03.300 --> 17:09.900
Competition rules to this finished product like whether where there are certain rules that made you want to go in this direction of developing

17:09.900 --> 17:11.900
This game or what happened I?

17:11.900 --> 17:18.460
Think you tapped into a little bit of controversy there because the the contest had one rule that you had to use this video game

17:18.460 --> 17:19.660
named generator

17:19.660 --> 17:25.580
Websites come up with a name for your game, and then make that and that's something I didn't actually do so

17:26.420 --> 17:29.260
What happened you get a really bad name out of it or something?

17:29.900 --> 17:35.980
No, I know what happened was I am I kind of started in that direction, so I started sort of looking at the generator

17:36.860 --> 17:41.820
Running it a couple times coming up with different names having to think about how it works and thinking about ways that I could

17:41.820 --> 17:47.380
Hook in an exciting game with that right and what I saw pretty quickly was that the generator was

17:48.060 --> 17:51.220
It was coming up with a couple of different concepts and just kind of mashing them together

17:51.820 --> 17:55.380
Which if you played ROM check file you'll see is certainly a part of ROM check file

17:55.740 --> 17:58.020
So anyway, I saw that and I thought hey

17:58.020 --> 18:03.460
You know what would be awesome is a game that actually generates lots of the games that come out of the generator

18:04.340 --> 18:06.340
so you know

18:06.420 --> 18:09.540
That's pretty funny. It's kind of it's telling you through all these games

18:09.540 --> 18:13.220
It's like you throw all these games in a blender and out comes this so it

18:13.620 --> 18:19.620
Wasn't necessarily that you had the idea to begin with the the blending of the names kind of inspired the blended game idea

18:19.660 --> 18:23.460
Yeah, totally so I was going to do stuff that actually came out of the generator

18:23.460 --> 18:27.500
But I realized possibly also with the help of some advice from a friend that

18:28.420 --> 18:34.540
When somebody sees an emu on the screen and and there's a dragonfly, but I don't know what that means right whereas

18:34.540 --> 18:37.980
If they see Mario, and they see some space invaders. They totally get that immediately

18:37.980 --> 18:41.500
Well, I don't know the first time I played ROM check fail. It took me a minute to get it

18:43.340 --> 18:48.580
But but just imagine how much would have been if you didn't actually know what the characters were all the ways that they

18:48.820 --> 18:50.820
interacted with each other so

18:51.540 --> 18:54.220
Not only was it kind of tapping into the whole nostalgia vibe

18:54.220 --> 18:58.700
But it but it also communicated to the player much more quickly what the hell was going on

18:59.020 --> 19:03.980
I guess that's a very good point because you know eventually kind of figure out okay if I'm pac-man right now

19:03.980 --> 19:09.660
I better eat this dot before I try to touch something or I'm gonna be in trouble. So yeah, do you think that's right?

19:09.660 --> 19:14.140
Whereas if you were a penguin and you had to go pick up a water lily before you could eat things you

19:14.220 --> 19:16.220
You would never think of that

19:17.180 --> 19:19.980
Unless I was playing the penguin and water lily game. I don't know

19:20.940 --> 19:22.060
Maybe it would be in the title

19:22.060 --> 19:27.580
Do you think it's that nostalgia is the part of the reason why this game is just kind of like spread like wildfire amongst all

19:27.580 --> 19:32.620
The gaming blogs and the internet and kind of like caught on I think that has helped a lot. Yeah, um

19:32.620 --> 19:37.260
Which is a shame because that's not really what the game was meant to be about but you know, I'll take it

19:37.820 --> 19:41.900
What what is the game meant to be about? Well, whenever I make a game, I usually think about it

19:42.460 --> 19:46.220
Just starting with a gameplay concept first. So I think about the way that the game's gonna play

19:46.220 --> 19:49.660
I don't really think too much about what it looks like or the narrative or anything like that

19:50.300 --> 19:52.620
And this game like I was saying was about

19:53.340 --> 19:55.340
matching different kind of

19:55.900 --> 20:00.300
Archetypal characters together just kind of throwing them in a scene saying deal with it

20:00.300 --> 20:05.740
Um, what was the question again? No, that's okay. Um, what like

20:06.780 --> 20:12.560
Um, I guess we were talking about the that is spreading along the blogs and it's kind of like wildfire and the nostalgia

20:12.940 --> 20:19.100
Is the nostalgia part of you know, why this game you think is caught on so so popular?

20:19.900 --> 20:23.740
Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, I think I think that's half of it. Um

20:24.620 --> 20:28.220
Because I mean you look around you you're gonna find a lot of games that that are

20:28.220 --> 20:33.660
You're gonna find a lot of games that that take mario sprites and chuck them in a game or or that kind of thing

20:34.140 --> 20:37.580
Um, so it's not not unique in in the first thing

20:37.820 --> 20:42.460
What's largely unique is the way that it uses them and the fact that there is a playable game underneath

20:43.400 --> 20:49.020
Absolutely. Did you have to recreate all of the the the mario and I I don't know if this might be a controversial thing

20:49.020 --> 20:50.940
I'm asking so you can feel free to say no comment

20:50.940 --> 20:56.380
But did you have to recreate all those sprites and the music and everything or did you were you able to kind of?

20:56.380 --> 20:59.420
I don't know. I guess borrow from the games that were already out there

20:59.420 --> 21:01.820
How much of this did you have to kind of build from scratch?

21:02.860 --> 21:04.380
uh, well

21:04.380 --> 21:09.820
Strangely enough this actually took most of my time like recreating the the gameplay interactions and things

21:10.140 --> 21:13.020
was very quick when I was just using a bunch of squares, but

21:14.060 --> 21:18.140
Once I started looking at the the proper sprites from all the games and the sounds and everything

21:18.220 --> 21:20.220
It was a huge process to um

21:21.180 --> 21:24.860
To pull it all together and it came from whatever source I could find first to be honest

21:24.860 --> 21:29.340
So there's there's a lot of sprite rip pages that I used. So thanks to everybody who put those together

21:29.900 --> 21:35.180
Um, all the music came from different people's websites where they they've sort of re-orchestrated tunes

21:35.180 --> 21:38.780
Which I then tweaked a little bit to make them sound a little bit more like each other

21:39.340 --> 21:41.260
And cut them up and pasted them together. So it was

21:41.900 --> 21:46.940
I like to think of it as a collaborative effort from the entire internet retro gaming community

21:47.020 --> 21:51.340
I was gonna say i'm thinking this isn't my name's on the credits. This isn't just like a hodgepodge of a game

21:51.340 --> 21:55.580
It's also kind of a mixture of all these different contributions that are already out there on the internet

21:55.820 --> 21:59.660
So some guy who ripped zelda sprites might have helped with this game and didn't even know it

22:00.220 --> 22:04.060
Um, yep. Yep, since this game's kind of spread all around the internet, you know

22:04.140 --> 22:09.340
You gotta love the way the internet kind of reacts to things and i'm sure your email box has been starting to get some

22:09.420 --> 22:14.140
Emails about rom check fail if you've gotten any kind of like crazy feedback about the game or what's like the craziest thing

22:14.140 --> 22:16.140
You've gotten in response to the game

22:16.940 --> 22:21.100
Uh, actually I haven't really got much back from it, which is which is a bit surprising

22:21.100 --> 22:24.380
Um, I think a lot of people play the game through a direct link

22:24.380 --> 22:29.660
So they don't even see my website and people who do even like pick it up by going through my website

22:29.660 --> 22:35.260
Don't don't think to email me. So it's been a bit quiet. I mean the the tig source feedback threads have been great

22:35.900 --> 22:37.420
um

22:37.420 --> 22:41.260
But unless i've explicitly asked people to talk about my game it's usually been a bit quiet

22:41.740 --> 22:44.220
Well, that's a damn shame. We need to get some of our listeners to send

22:44.860 --> 22:49.420
Love for making this game for free as part of a competition. So listeners send farb's little love

22:49.420 --> 22:51.900
Where's the website they can get in touch with you? Oh, uh,

22:52.440 --> 22:55.820
www.farb's.org f a r b s excellent

22:55.820 --> 22:59.340
Do you have any uh future projects you can talk about things that might be coming to the website soon?

22:59.340 --> 23:01.340
Because you have some other games already on the website, too

23:01.340 --> 23:03.740
This isn't the only thing you've ever done you have some other games as well

23:04.220 --> 23:08.620
But um, do you have anything in the future? You might want to give us some hints about uh

23:10.540 --> 23:13.580
I would love to but unfortunately i'm still deciding what i'm gonna do next

23:13.580 --> 23:20.540
I mean i've got i've always got about a dozen ideas kind of floating around bumping into each other and it usually takes

23:20.860 --> 23:27.660
Something to actually push me to put something together as a game. So the uh, the vgng compo was great for me because I I had

23:28.380 --> 23:31.260
You know some concept about games that I wanted to make

23:31.660 --> 23:35.100
Suddenly I had a three-week deadline to actually do something and so I got something done

23:35.500 --> 23:38.780
Whereas now i'm back in that phase of sort of thinking. Oh, I don't know what I want to do next

23:38.860 --> 23:41.260
So there will be games coming I can promise you that

23:41.260 --> 23:45.420
But I have no idea which ones excellent. Well here, you know something we at orange launch radio

23:45.420 --> 23:47.580
Have been talking about our dream game for a long time, you know

23:47.580 --> 23:51.820
I'll just kind of throw it out there if you can make a game with cats wielding lasers at each other

23:52.300 --> 23:55.820
Might be an amazing game. So just give me something to think about maybe for the sequel

23:57.260 --> 24:01.180
Now something we always ask all of our guests that come on the program because you know, we're all gamers

24:01.500 --> 24:03.660
What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

24:03.740 --> 24:08.460
Have you been playing independent games you a console gamer pc gamer? What kind of games you've been playing this week?

24:08.460 --> 24:11.100
Uh, this week's been very quiet for me. I've uh,

24:11.900 --> 24:15.740
I've been a bit busy. So I haven't haven't been able to get into any massive titles. So

24:16.300 --> 24:20.780
Mostly for me it's been just sort of picking up indie titles because usually you can kind of pick them up have a bit of

24:20.780 --> 24:23.420
A play and then and then put them down again because they're not very large

24:24.220 --> 24:29.100
Um other than that bit of smash brothers friend of mine imported it so we were actually able to play it which is nice

24:29.740 --> 24:33.820
Awesome, nothing big very cool. Do you find yourself drawn to other indie games?

24:33.820 --> 24:35.980
Do you like to kind of sample what else is out there in the indie world?

24:35.980 --> 24:41.500
Yeah, I like to but but like I said, I mean i'm interested in gameplay mechanics and you're going to see a lot more variation

24:41.500 --> 24:43.980
in that kind of stuff in indie games, but

24:44.860 --> 24:45.900
also

24:45.900 --> 24:49.820
They're they're small and disposable and that that's really great when you've you know, got 10 minutes free

24:50.140 --> 24:54.620
Uh, it's a lot better than thinking. Oh i've got 10 minutes free. I'm going to start morrowind that that doesn't add up

24:56.140 --> 25:00.780
Exactly, um, I got one more question for you and this might be opening a big can of worms

25:00.780 --> 25:03.900
But it's something we've been kind of talking about a little bit in the past on this program

25:03.900 --> 25:09.100
And that would be kind of the future of uh console, you know gaming as we see these more

25:10.060 --> 25:15.900
Independent scene friendly things start to open up such as xna and we wear and things like that

25:16.220 --> 25:20.620
From your viewpoint as somebody who's been kind of developing independent games. What do you do? Do you think that?

25:21.260 --> 25:26.940
Xna and the these things that are going to make uh console development a little more accessible to the indie developer

25:26.940 --> 25:31.420
Do you think this is going to be the next big thing in gaming? Do you think this is going to take off or do you think?

25:31.420 --> 25:35.500
Yeah, this pc is always where it's really going to be at

25:37.020 --> 25:42.060
Well, I think uh the the the xna thing that they're coming up with where pretty much any game can get

25:42.620 --> 25:49.260
Distributed is is definitely going to be interesting. Um, but in that sense, I think it's just going to really look a lot more like pc

25:50.220 --> 25:57.260
I don't think we're ever going to really hit that that kind of wonderland that all all indie game developers

25:57.260 --> 26:02.860
Hope will one day open up where you know, you can make a game in three months by yourself

26:02.860 --> 26:08.300
And push it out on a console and suddenly make millions and millions of dollars. I mean those those opportunities pop up occasionally

26:08.860 --> 26:10.860
But they're extremely rare. So

26:12.300 --> 26:16.220
I don't know. I I think it'll open up a bit more. I think it'll become a little bit more like pc

26:16.300 --> 26:18.300
But I don't think we'll see any major changes

26:19.500 --> 26:24.780
All right. Well farbs. Thanks so much for joining us all the way from australia tonight. We really appreciate it farbs

26:24.780 --> 26:27.740
He is the man that wrote rom check fail it check him out

26:28.380 --> 26:35.820
Www.farbz.org and you can download other games as well. Not just rom check fails. So check that out

26:36.220 --> 26:38.220
Farbz, thanks so much for being with us tonight

26:39.260 --> 26:41.260
All right. Cheers. All right. Take care

26:42.460 --> 26:47.260
I I want to listen to him talk some more. That was really cool. Sorry. He's gone now

26:47.260 --> 26:53.660
So yeah, but yeah, it's something about accents aren't isn't there but I I want I want I want laser capture

26:53.660 --> 26:56.860
And and he's quite talented. I mean rom check. I was very surprised

26:56.860 --> 27:00.860
I mean, I kind of knew going into that interview that rom check fail was done by pretty much one guy

27:00.860 --> 27:05.740
But that's still very impressive, you know, i'm always impressed by some of the levels of talent out there

27:05.740 --> 27:10.300
Well, best of luck to farbz and thanks for taking the kind of time to come on the show. We appreciate it

27:10.380 --> 27:14.540
Are you a big fan of rom check fail loki? I think you were the one that showed that to me first played it a bit

27:14.780 --> 27:18.460
Yeah, I don't know. It's one of those games that you can play for just a little bit and then

27:19.100 --> 27:21.500
Leave it for a while. It's like the game that made me go

27:21.500 --> 27:25.500
What is that music and then I realized it was marble madness. It's like it's like

27:25.740 --> 27:30.380
WarioWare type of thing like as long as you could just play for like a little bit and it's like total crack and fun

27:30.380 --> 27:35.820
You're like, okay. It's like it's a good like micro game like the c1 that it was just all like nintendo stuff like, you know

27:35.820 --> 27:37.980
mega man with mario's all the

27:38.540 --> 27:43.500
Well, he might hit copyright issues with that. I mean, well, I guess he already is. Yeah, who cares? That's true

27:43.500 --> 27:48.140
Okay, make something for we wear or something. That's why you need to do it like all underground, you know

27:48.140 --> 27:52.060
And don't say who you are and just throw it out there on like, you know, the bit torrent

27:52.060 --> 27:56.620
Well, I would gather farb's is probably not his real name. Well, I'm just saying speculation

27:56.620 --> 28:00.940
I'm just saying though instead of like having a website and stuff because if you do it all underground and stuff like that

28:01.580 --> 28:06.940
They can't really stop yet. I mean, especially if you just kind of throw it out there, you know, just let it catch the current

28:07.340 --> 28:10.380
All right. Well, we want to thank farms again for taking the time to come on the show

28:11.020 --> 28:17.020
All the time away from developing new games for us more crack for us later on. All right, let's get back to the show

28:17.020 --> 28:22.940
Later on. All right. Let's get back into the gaming news. Loki take it away. All right. So here's another rumor that's coming around

28:23.020 --> 28:24.860
That's not a big surprise

28:24.860 --> 28:30.140
But um, i'm interested in to see that they're actually kind of going this route or maybe thinking going this route

28:30.620 --> 28:38.220
Um rumor is that microsoft course is good looking into creating a wiimote like device for the xbox

28:38.600 --> 28:39.500
360

28:39.500 --> 28:42.860
Uh, the motion controller is going to be codenamed newton

28:43.580 --> 28:45.260
and uh

28:45.260 --> 28:47.900
No word on what exactly this might be

28:48.300 --> 28:49.580
Uh something though

28:49.580 --> 28:56.700
it will use a like a usb powered sensor bar and it will possibly have rumble motors as well as um,

28:57.820 --> 29:01.660
a microphone built in for voice activated games, so

29:02.700 --> 29:07.740
It's interesting that they might be going this route and the same way I kind of think you know

29:07.820 --> 29:12.940
It's not a little copy cat-ish a little bit, but everybody kind of copies everybody at some point. So

29:12.940 --> 29:14.940
And I know microsoft has had

29:15.100 --> 29:20.380
Not great success trying to tap that family market and stuff that nintendo has but

29:21.180 --> 29:23.020
Well seen it hasn't done bad for them

29:23.260 --> 29:27.980
I mean, you know, even though amongst the hardcore we kind of all turn our noses at it and go it's kind of dumb

29:28.220 --> 29:31.260
But apparently it's been doing fairly well for them. So who knows?

29:32.460 --> 29:36.860
I don't think as well as like say we sports or something like that. No, I don't think well

29:36.860 --> 29:39.180
I don't you just never know with microsoft

29:39.180 --> 29:44.700
I know with microsoft microsoft kind of has a way of taking it at somebody else's idea and kicking it up a notch

29:44.700 --> 29:49.020
You know what? I mean, but can you imagine though just if you will like motion controlled games with

29:49.960 --> 29:55.180
360s graphics. Yeah, I mean that'd be fucking awesome. I don't know. Uh, what do you think dark sakura? Do you think uh,

29:55.740 --> 29:59.980
Do you think it could be successful motion control on the 360 or and I open this up to chat, too

30:00.220 --> 30:01.180
What do you guys think of it?

30:01.180 --> 30:04.700
Do you think it could be successful in the 360 or is it gonna feel like a cheap knockoff of wii?

30:05.660 --> 30:07.900
I really don't think it would be that difficult to integrate

30:07.900 --> 30:14.460
Into um, the 360 because really all you need is just the uh, the input device, you know

30:14.780 --> 30:17.100
The the thing you need your sensor bar, of course

30:19.660 --> 30:23.340
Oh there went my power plug again, um, I don't think that it's it's going to

30:24.860 --> 30:26.780
I really don't think that it's going to be

30:27.820 --> 30:31.820
That sort of cheap knockoff thing, but I think people are going to have a preconceived notion

30:32.460 --> 30:36.620
About how it's supposed to work because they have this experience with the wii

30:36.620 --> 30:38.940
You know, I think it's really all about the games

30:39.180 --> 30:42.140
It really is, you know, depending on what they release with it

30:42.140 --> 30:47.660
And if they've been paying any attention to the wii they're going to take something like wii sports or carnival games and really kick it

30:47.660 --> 30:52.460
Up a notch and uh, it might do very well. This is a chance to either sink or bail with it

30:52.460 --> 30:59.260
I mean, I mean sink or swim with it. I mean and if they swim they'll be you know, because Microsoft they'll be walking on water

30:59.980 --> 31:01.980
Comments from chat room chat.orangelaundry.com

31:01.980 --> 31:07.100
RawstealUT is predicting that newton much like xbox live vision will have incredibly limited use

31:07.660 --> 31:12.780
That is the problem. I mean at least nintendo built their whole console around the concept so, you know, the game's integrated

31:13.420 --> 31:17.100
VxjasonXV our fearless webmaster says Microsoft wants to tap that

31:18.220 --> 31:25.420
Gerardimo says I want motion control res. Oh or space channel 5 does come to xbox live arcade do want motion control

31:25.420 --> 31:32.940
Choo, choo, you never know it'll be interesting. So I just you said that I was already starting to think of samba

31:32.940 --> 31:36.460
D'amigo the one we with the posing well, they are doing that

31:36.460 --> 31:40.060
I know that's what I started thinking of doing your bizarro little poses

31:40.060 --> 31:43.740
Uh juiceton says imagine a game that requires the camera and the motion controller

31:44.780 --> 31:50.220
Good idea, but imagine the highly limited audience that's going to reach unless xbox then puts out a you know

31:50.220 --> 31:55.580
Another bundle that comes with both which I guess is is very possible. I don't know

31:56.540 --> 31:58.540
Who knows?

31:58.540 --> 32:05.500
So, uh, we'll continue on with the gaming news and I want to talk about metal gear solid online, you know over here

32:05.500 --> 32:10.140
Uh, you had to pre-order the game in order to get the metal gear online demo, but guess what?

32:10.700 --> 32:17.260
In the european playstation store metal gear online premiere beta free download on the playstation store

32:17.260 --> 32:20.380
April 17th to may 6th in europe

32:20.380 --> 32:25.500
So if you live in europe, you don't even have to pre-order although I imagine you know logic

32:25.500 --> 32:28.860
You know, usually this is the type of thing that would make us go woohoo free things are awesome

32:28.860 --> 32:32.220
But then again, I go I imagine most metal gear fans

32:32.860 --> 32:38.300
Probably pre-ordered the game anyway, so I can't imagine there's that many people but at the same time

32:38.300 --> 32:40.300
There might be some casual fans like for instance

32:41.020 --> 32:44.140
You know if if this were happening in the us I go

32:44.140 --> 32:48.620
Hmm free beta i'll download it and check it out. I may not be into metal gear that much but hey if it's free

32:48.620 --> 32:50.620
That gives me incentive to take a look

32:50.620 --> 32:56.860
Right rob what imagine technical, um, uh, the imagine babies. No

32:56.860 --> 32:59.100
Imagine not stumbling over your words imagine

32:59.740 --> 33:02.940
Uh tactical espionage action sounds like fun though

33:04.140 --> 33:05.580
babies

33:05.580 --> 33:07.580
babies with babies

33:07.580 --> 33:11.020
Yes a tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey

33:11.020 --> 33:15.500
A tactical espionage baby game metal gear bailey metal gear babies

33:15.980 --> 33:19.020
Maybe that'll be you know, because they have the flash forward in metal gear 4

33:19.020 --> 33:24.700
Maybe that'll be a metal gear 5 flash backwards. By the way, the beta is running from april 21st to may 6th

33:25.660 --> 33:30.460
Uh, which by the way happens to be one day less than we have it in north america. Hmm

33:32.060 --> 33:34.060
Something is afoot maybe all the uh

33:34.620 --> 33:39.340
Maybe all the european fandom over the years for sony is paying off. Who knows anyhow?

33:39.340 --> 33:46.060
Your fandom pays off every week when you send us emails to our address mailbag at orange laundry.com

33:46.060 --> 33:51.740
We love getting your emails and uh, just yes, we do dark sakura. Just say it. Yes, we do

33:53.980 --> 33:56.380
Even though we've moved over to all games.com now

33:56.380 --> 34:00.700
We move the mailbag with us and it's still the same email address mailbag at orange laundry.com

34:00.860 --> 34:05.660
Let's open up the mailbag and check out some of the email that came in since last week's show dark. Sakura

34:05.660 --> 34:11.420
Dive in head first. Will you into the mailbag and pull out some of your favorites? No, because there might be an anvil in there or something

34:11.980 --> 34:14.460
Or a spider. Oh, okay. So

34:15.660 --> 34:17.660
um first, um

34:18.300 --> 34:20.780
Email of the evening is from trisha licious

34:22.380 --> 34:27.900
That's a cool name trisha licious. I hate to say it. Oh, i'm gonna i'm gonna make us lose a fan

34:28.140 --> 34:30.140
But it does sound like a stripper name

34:30.140 --> 34:37.980
Dear olr, just picture the guns and roses in the background now taking the stage trisha licious on my ipod

34:38.460 --> 34:40.860
I thought I would ask you about a recent game

34:40.940 --> 34:47.100
I purchased and I had to buy it from an online retailer after reading a review in game informer magazine about pinball hall of fame

34:47.100 --> 34:52.060
The williams collection which received a high rating and for only being 30 bucks. I knew I had to have it

34:52.460 --> 34:56.380
I proceeded to my local gaming shop expecting them to have the game since it was

34:56.380 --> 35:00.300
Reviewed in their magazine, but nothing was on the shelf or listed in their computer database

35:00.700 --> 35:05.180
When I finally got the game after buying it online, I lo- I loaded it up and started playing

35:05.740 --> 35:10.540
Phf on my wii is the best pinball I have played on a pc or console

35:10.940 --> 35:15.280
I wanted to try to get the word out that this game really kicks major butt as a pinball simulator

35:15.980 --> 35:20.780
I love it and I want to make sure those all those who also love pinball to give it a try

35:21.260 --> 35:25.500
Now I want to go play these tables all over again if I can find them at a local arcade

35:25.500 --> 35:28.240
The local arcade love to you all huggies trishalicious

35:30.460 --> 35:32.460
Pinball is awesome

35:32.460 --> 35:38.860
Pinball is the best ever, you know, I downloaded a new table for pinball fx on xbox live this week the uh, buccaneer table

35:39.020 --> 35:42.140
Yeah, uh, but I didn't get a chance to play because I was down with that rocky and bullwinkle table

35:42.140 --> 35:45.340
but I got sidetracked my whole fantasy star universe thing, but I

35:46.380 --> 35:49.100
Trishalish is not the first person to point out that that's a fun game

35:49.100 --> 35:55.260
But I bet you especially would enjoy that you pinball whore really? Yes. Good times. Yes. All right

35:56.220 --> 36:02.060
How can they release a pinball collection a williams pinball collection and us not have it just just just checking?

36:02.620 --> 36:04.620
Okay, then. I'm

36:07.020 --> 36:12.220
What I was shaking my head anyway next email is

36:12.220 --> 36:18.000
Is kamatari's forever is who that is

36:18.000 --> 36:22.400
Hey, olr. Love your show been listening for about a month and one and wondering a few things

36:22.720 --> 36:25.360
Is the ferret still there from your transition to all games?

36:27.280 --> 36:29.120
That answer your question

36:29.120 --> 36:31.600
That would make me sad if it were shipped away into a box

36:32.480 --> 36:37.280
I've also heard rumors that konami will make a ddr 10th anniversary game sometime around this or next year

36:37.600 --> 36:41.040
Could that be plausible due to licensing fees and whatnot? Just want to know

36:41.040 --> 36:46.640
I could see it being plausible since they're probably running out of ideas for new ddr games anyways

36:47.640 --> 36:54.360
Yeah, there's not like too much they can do to revise. So let's put a new ddr game with all the classic konami songs

36:55.400 --> 36:57.480
Wait, that's like every other ddr game

36:57.600 --> 37:03.080
What I think that they should do if they did like an anniversary edition is to have you be able to choose your mode

37:03.080 --> 37:06.440
That you play in so you can actually load up

37:06.440 --> 37:12.620
the very first ddr and have to do your little jumps around for your codes and shit and have it all be

37:13.620 --> 37:21.400
Unvivid and you know instead have like second mix mode where you have dance battle pop-up because you know dance battle was the best thing

37:21.400 --> 37:23.400
about about second mix and

37:23.900 --> 37:30.820
You know, you should do stuff like that like a third mix have paint mode or something, you know stuff like an SSR

37:32.180 --> 37:33.420
Whoops

37:33.420 --> 37:35.420
Or you can dance to this song

37:35.420 --> 37:37.420
What a hoe down? Anyway

37:37.420 --> 37:39.420
Hope that's what I get for leaving things running

37:39.420 --> 37:41.420
Can I be, do you have something to say about

37:42.060 --> 37:46.220
It would not be a first show on all games if I didn't screw up somehow. So there you have it

37:46.220 --> 37:47.720
Do you have something to say about the ditter?

37:47.720 --> 37:53.140
Look, I've been saying forever if ddr wants to evolve the game needs to be they need to scrap all their old code

37:53.540 --> 37:55.540
Rebuild the game from the ground up

37:56.660 --> 37:58.880
Honestly make it look like guitar hero at this point

37:58.880 --> 38:02.380
I think that's the best way to make a catch on here in the US. I hate to say it

38:02.380 --> 38:06.780
How about okay? How about this? You just totally ignore like all the like tutorials and

38:07.300 --> 38:12.020
Get rid of quest mode for the love of God quest mode is

38:12.540 --> 38:16.700
Crap or redo quest I think quest mode has potential to be good

38:16.700 --> 38:21.780
No, no, but not in its current form quest mode is crap what they need to have bring challenge mode back

38:21.780 --> 38:24.700
That's fine. The challenge modes. I think are a lot more fun

38:25.500 --> 38:26.740
or

38:26.740 --> 38:30.020
Challenging than quest mode quest mode is like okay play allows on go. Oh

38:30.020 --> 38:32.020
Oh fun

38:32.140 --> 38:38.060
Nothing like repetition. I just think if they want the DER to continue they should you know remit

38:38.060 --> 38:41.980
I've said it for years. They need to make DDR take it from being cooperative and making competitive

38:42.260 --> 38:48.980
But that's just me or have like new modifiers that are song specific that like certain things happen in the song

38:48.980 --> 38:54.320
Maybe integrated with like, you know videos or something that are playing like the arrows fall down different ways or something like that

38:54.700 --> 38:56.700
I mean, which would be pretty cool like different

38:57.380 --> 38:58.780
themes

38:58.780 --> 39:02.340
All right, next email next email is

39:03.700 --> 39:05.700
As soon as it loads up

39:06.820 --> 39:09.140
Next email comes to us from Harvey. Oh

39:10.460 --> 39:14.900
Sorry, it comes just from a poorly formatted email. Um, I'm

39:15.900 --> 39:20.040
Okay, I'm just gonna say Harvey was the last name because they put their full name in there. So that's what I'm gonna say

39:20.040 --> 39:25.220
Um, hey, what's up, Ol R. I was wondering what do you think about Sony saying DualShock?

39:25.220 --> 39:29.740
Wouldn't fit in a 6-axis controller and now it's there. How ironic

39:30.180 --> 39:32.620
they didn't ever say it wouldn't fit just they

39:33.100 --> 39:37.040
Couldn't do it at the same time with the tilt and it's so last

39:37.040 --> 39:42.420
Yeah, I mean and it's actually the same shell. In fact, there's actually spots for the two rumble motors. So

39:43.340 --> 39:50.540
That's bullshit. Do you think that redesigning the PSN store will affect the amount of content that is bought?

39:50.540 --> 39:57.260
Will you guys be buying any games from the new we wear section next month? Also do like 365 give dark soccer a cookie. I

39:58.180 --> 40:01.100
Will make it one of my goals as a gamer to give her a cookie

40:03.100 --> 40:06.220
Dude cookies are great, but you have to get it to me by next weekend

40:06.940 --> 40:10.540
Because it's your birthday. It's my birthday. That's right. I mean, whatever I want to

40:11.660 --> 40:13.660
cookies and booze

40:13.940 --> 40:16.660
Life is five did not give you a cookie. In fact, they gave me a migraine

40:16.660 --> 40:18.660
Uh

40:19.300 --> 40:21.300
Yeah, I

40:21.460 --> 40:26.820
Want to they owe me a cookie and then they owe Rob money as far as we wear. Yes

40:26.820 --> 40:30.540
I'm hoping there's some movies or something gameplay videos that make its way to the US sites

40:30.540 --> 40:32.540
I can learn a little more about these games

40:32.820 --> 40:37.380
Than just having to take a leap of faith. You know, I mean that game just like well, yeah

40:37.380 --> 40:41.820
Okay, maybe there's certain cases where I would take a leap of faith and like I already know I want that. Dr

40:41.820 --> 40:46.500
Mario game especially it has like the online and everything but you know some of those old ones like even like Final Fantasy

40:46.500 --> 40:47.740
I'm kind of like

40:47.740 --> 40:51.140
Honest, I don't know if I have the room on my Wii hard drive to fit that stuff

40:51.140 --> 40:55.580
You know how many freaking virtual console games I have a sad amount sad amount

40:56.260 --> 40:57.860
well

40:57.860 --> 41:02.020
This person has listed gamer goals and I have to read some of these because I have to respond to some of them

41:02.020 --> 41:07.140
Okay gamer goals. Yes. There's 15 goals. Are you to read them all Phyllis is not in order Oh

41:07.700 --> 41:12.140
One be a guest on attack of the show either in person or webcam viewer. Why?

41:12.140 --> 41:16.500
You know rated be a guest on x-play in person. Why?

41:17.140 --> 41:20.780
Overrated special guests don't have guests anymore on x-play. Oh

41:21.340 --> 41:24.460
Well, I guess they don't have viewers anymore. I guess on

41:25.060 --> 41:26.780
live viewers

41:26.780 --> 41:31.700
Special guest on a gamer podcast. Oh, well, our gamer tech radio all games radio IGN EGM

41:31.700 --> 41:35.080
Oh XM game scoop beyond or three red lights all of those

41:35.080 --> 41:41.800
I might be tricky come to yeah getting on all ours easy. Yeah, just show up or you know

41:41.800 --> 41:45.960
Call us on the skype line. It's very easy to get on the show same thing with all games interactive

41:45.960 --> 41:49.240
At least they do they do their phones are open the whole time

41:49.240 --> 41:54.040
I don't know how they do it because they keep their phones open the whole show if we did that we get derailed even faster

41:54.040 --> 41:57.680
And we already do but uh, you know, they have their phones open all day

41:57.680 --> 42:01.360
We've been on that show and it's very tangenty too, but it's fun. Yes

42:01.360 --> 42:05.200
For go to e3. You don't want to go there anymore. I

42:06.080 --> 42:12.400
Do speak for yourself. Well, I want to but I don't think that it's e3 is not what it was

42:13.000 --> 42:17.320
So just to let you know. Yeah. Okay miss got invited last year and didn't go I

42:19.200 --> 42:21.040
Had other things to do

42:21.040 --> 42:25.720
Have the game room in my future home. That's always a good idea battle it out over

42:25.720 --> 42:31.840
Major league gaming and a battle out at major league gaming. Okay, get my degree in video game design

42:31.840 --> 42:34.560
I'm good. This is one of the ones I wanted to talk about. I

42:35.200 --> 42:38.480
Have a friend who's a game designer and she has a math degree

42:39.000 --> 42:42.720
So just a word of warning you'd want to go in programming or math

42:43.320 --> 42:47.820
Not something not or go in the art side of it and go into you know

42:49.040 --> 42:51.720
Graphic design or digital art just letting you know

42:51.720 --> 42:58.160
I don't think there's actually anything an actual video game design some folks in chat room are commenting on this whole e3 thing

42:59.360 --> 43:04.200
And Gerardo most said I want to be a guest on xplay four years ago. Justin says

43:05.160 --> 43:10.400
E3 is lame sauce now. It's all about packs. I'm oh god. I hope I hope I get to go to packs this year

43:10.400 --> 43:14.680
I think I'm gonna go I want to go I think they're supposed to be like a big all games like

43:14.800 --> 43:19.440
Thing like Voltron thing happening at packs. So I definitely would go. I know it's gonna be hot

43:19.440 --> 43:20.800
um

43:20.800 --> 43:22.800
What was the other thing I want to see?

43:25.520 --> 43:29.360
Recruit number zero seven four five says e3 was cool before they fucked it over

43:29.640 --> 43:32.480
By the way, ask someone how to change your neck so we can give you your proper name

43:32.840 --> 43:37.240
Black wolf says last year's e3 was the best e3 I went to and I've been to 11 of them

43:39.040 --> 43:43.760
Lucky you Bobby, but I think the whole point though is that this person might not since we're on all games now

43:43.760 --> 43:45.760
Are we gonna get into the e3 this year?

43:45.760 --> 43:50.880
Frickin hope so. Yeah an article. Yeah, I know. We'll write articles. I'm a good writer

43:51.880 --> 43:55.840
Anyway, um make a video game. Well, you'll need your design creds then

43:57.120 --> 44:00.760
Review another company's video game you could do that if you got a blog

44:01.560 --> 44:04.280
Travel to Japan and meet the people at Konami and Square Enix

44:04.600 --> 44:12.100
Okay, go to New York and hang out with true homie the rage 65 scariest glow retro king grow

44:12.100 --> 44:18.380
Why boy and others they are some of my friends on xbox live get my xbox 360 autographed by the guys over orange on radio

44:18.580 --> 44:20.580
We could do that

44:21.200 --> 44:24.120
We could we I need me a new xbox, you know

44:26.120 --> 44:29.880
Several people have asked about the faceplates now. I'm I'm almost feeling like oh god

44:29.880 --> 44:33.180
We're gonna have to come up with some way to do this for everybody who wants one

44:33.480 --> 44:36.680
So what things like or at least get autographed pictures or something?

44:36.680 --> 44:41.160
I never thought we'd be at that level where I cuz I totally feel like a picture of me

44:41.160 --> 44:44.860
I don't know. Like don't you feel like a total like pompous asshole by say

44:47.400 --> 44:51.160
What was I do have the sign pictures from was it that

44:51.720 --> 44:55.320
Attack of the attack of the show. I think it was it still the screen

44:55.320 --> 44:56.880
It was still the screen savers at that point

44:56.880 --> 45:01.780
I think cuz I got my dad one cuz he liked the screen savers. Yeah. Yeah. Well

45:02.600 --> 45:04.480
We'll figure we'll figure out how to do it

45:04.480 --> 45:09.400
I've had somebody email my personal email that once one and you know Osfer was the guy I kind of started it

45:09.400 --> 45:12.460
I know we will figure something out within the next couple weeks. I promise

45:13.080 --> 45:17.840
So the last three yes, it's get a copy of Gears of War one and two autographed by Clippy B

45:18.640 --> 45:22.060
Attend the University of Advanced Technology and give dark Sakura a cookie

45:23.520 --> 45:30.300
Those are some you would be fulfilling the being on a show on a podcast and the giving me a cookie one at the same

45:30.300 --> 45:37.320
Time and even the signature the autograph before you here in studio. I know we're awesome. Well, here's the thing

45:37.320 --> 45:41.440
Here's the thing here. Where's this guy live? Did he say no if you live near Pax?

45:41.800 --> 45:46.320
This might be your opportunity to do like three in one shot because you come to Pax you can be on our show

45:46.440 --> 45:49.400
Give Jamie her cookie and we'll autograph whatever crap. I

45:49.960 --> 45:53.000
Cookie on our packs. No asshole

45:53.000 --> 45:58.840
I will eat the cookie on air as long as it does not have marshmallows or white chocolate in it or poison or poison

45:58.840 --> 46:05.000
I don't know. I've poison maybe if it's tasty. All right, I will die for tasty food and I'm kidding

46:05.000 --> 46:09.600
Um, anyway, um last email is um, thanks for switching to all games radio

46:09.600 --> 46:15.640
I couldn't even listen to you live on life through 65. Anyway, I'm happy you switched seamlessly, but down to business

46:15.640 --> 46:20.760
I want to ask you guys are you actually going to air the fuck show and when?

46:22.120 --> 46:27.400
Looking forward to it. Thanks for your time Zeppelin. Yeah, remember that we were supposed to do the fuck show

46:28.720 --> 46:32.040
Fucking hell, I don't know if that's actually gonna happen next week

46:32.040 --> 46:35.560
I just because I'm gonna be out of town most of the weekend and it's just it's

46:35.720 --> 46:40.560
We can't say when it's gonna happen. We got to pick a show and not tell you I like that idea

46:40.560 --> 46:43.400
It should just fucking happen whenever the fuck I

46:44.520 --> 46:49.360
The fuck show will happen. It won't happen next week, but it'll happen before summer

46:50.720 --> 46:55.880
Is that weird? Yeah, we have to have one listener in on it just because they have to keep tally, but

46:56.520 --> 47:00.960
Well, we'll tell dark Tetsuya or somebody, you know, who's been listening forever that we know is good gonna do a good job

47:00.960 --> 47:04.920
Keeping tally. But yeah, if you don't know what the fuck show is you listen last week's show

47:04.920 --> 47:08.680
It's this completely idiotic and stupid idea. We had that is so funny

47:08.680 --> 47:13.580
It makes us giggle like in only places that what they play calm snap can

47:16.380 --> 47:19.120
By the way, how much do I love the wiki editors?

47:19.780 --> 47:23.780
The people that work on our wiki which is the orange lounge radio dot wiki calm

47:24.040 --> 47:27.920
How much do I love them especially namely and a lot of people are getting in on it now?

47:27.920 --> 47:34.160
But namely AJ mix and dark Tetsuya have been doing probably about 80% of the work. If not a little more. I love this

47:34.400 --> 47:39.400
here's the summary you go in oops you go into the page that says dream games, right and

47:40.400 --> 47:42.400
Let's see. We have they're all accounted for

47:42.960 --> 47:48.960
Sky's voice the game laser cats Loki's world of randomness rice princess presents boobies and pandas

47:49.620 --> 47:51.960
forbidden Bomberman pen and paper

47:51.960 --> 47:57.680
furries and then cosplayers versus furries and here's the new entry what they play calm snap a

47:57.880 --> 48:03.960
Nintendo Wii game involving taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck

48:09.120 --> 48:12.120
Beautiful a gold star for AJ mix who made that edit

48:13.160 --> 48:14.360
You know

48:14.360 --> 48:17.480
Someone else emailed something that I'm actually not going to

48:17.480 --> 48:22.780
To really talk much about because I can't watch it while we're live, but someone sent me an engineer's guide to cats

48:25.240 --> 48:27.320
Just the thought of that could be morbid

48:27.320 --> 48:34.200
I think I'm just going well especially since Dan was showing Julie that South Park episode last night about sniffing cat butts and

48:35.440 --> 48:36.920
so

48:36.920 --> 48:42.400
That just sort of makes me think of that. I'll watch it later, but thank you whoever sent me an engineer's guide to cats

48:42.400 --> 48:46.360
And that's it all right

48:46.360 --> 48:50.760
If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is the place to go

48:52.320 --> 48:54.860
Speaking of pen and paper the game Loki

48:56.400 --> 49:00.080
Yes, speaking of pen and paper the game now

49:00.960 --> 49:07.040
The game that we're referring to of course is lol never party alone. It's a multiplayer only game

49:07.720 --> 49:11.200
Put out by age tech. It's actually kind of like

49:11.200 --> 49:14.840
Pictionary sort of you basically draw

49:15.440 --> 49:17.800
that will give you like I guess a

49:18.640 --> 49:20.640
theme or a

49:20.660 --> 49:25.840
statement or something like draw a funny clown, and then you have to draw a clown or something like that and

49:27.480 --> 49:30.640
You know everybody draws it then one person votes on so it's like I guess

49:31.200 --> 49:34.840
Pictionary meets apples apples, and then the winner gets a point

49:35.000 --> 49:40.440
But the thing is as we said pen and paper of the game you can do this on pen and paper already

49:40.440 --> 49:44.840
You don't need the buy game. Well unfortunately you won't be able to buy this game

49:45.520 --> 49:47.520
in stores because

49:47.520 --> 49:48.920
according to

49:48.920 --> 49:53.620
The game's distributor age tech it will be available online only

49:54.360 --> 49:55.680
so

49:55.680 --> 49:57.680
Yeah, you won't find this in stores

49:58.880 --> 50:01.800
That's all right buy a tablet of paper and pens instead

50:01.800 --> 50:08.720
Oh just what is it surprising if what if you're playing it in a store?

50:10.360 --> 50:12.080
Then it will be in a store

50:12.080 --> 50:13.700
You can't buy it in a store though

50:13.700 --> 50:17.140
What if you were downloading it while you're in the store and paying the money while you're in that store?

50:17.400 --> 50:23.240
No, it's not downloadable. It's just that you're buying you have to buy it from their online store

50:23.280 --> 50:29.500
What if you're in there? Oh, what if you have your laptop, and you're at a store, okay? I'm picky

50:29.500 --> 50:35.980
Just forget it. Do you really need this game? I mean, it's not like what else did they sell online only electroplankton?

50:36.460 --> 50:40.500
Yeah, I like electroplankton. I know but exactly that was a game. That was worth buying online

50:41.140 --> 50:46.620
Lol, I don't know. I don't know about that one. You know you know what the the alternative to

50:47.140 --> 50:49.140
Lol is hmm. It's

50:50.020 --> 50:52.020
No open canvas

50:52.520 --> 50:54.520
picto chat

50:55.100 --> 50:56.760
Well guys

50:56.760 --> 51:00.340
We're going to get into another segment. We do here on orange launch radio once in a while

51:00.340 --> 51:03.140
and I kind of gave away what's coming earlier based on the music, but

51:06.660 --> 51:10.180
That's right when you hear that happy music. You know something really fucked up happened

51:10.180 --> 51:12.980
And it's probably time to give out another olr stupid award

51:13.740 --> 51:15.740
this time

51:15.780 --> 51:23.220
18 year old Jean-Pierre, Orla, Orla wiz Orla wick wiz Orla wick is ol

51:23.220 --> 51:27.260
or le w icz or le was wiz

51:27.260 --> 51:33.260
I don't even know how to say that he is on trial right now for first degree premeditated murder

51:33.500 --> 51:40.140
Guess what him and his friend did they sound so happy they ambushed 26 year old Daniel Sorensen in

51:40.660 --> 51:44.540
November they stabbed him in the back and then sawed off his head and burned his body

51:45.100 --> 51:49.060
This was not a video game. This is real life. It is not funny when it happens in real life

51:49.060 --> 51:53.420
It's not as offensive as two guys kissing though

51:53.420 --> 51:55.420
Don't even

51:55.420 --> 51:57.420
Oh my god this guy looks psychotic

51:57.420 --> 52:03.860
I know seriously okay, so the trial is going on right now, but here it is. Here's what happened the defense is

52:04.660 --> 52:07.700
Blaming hitman that's right hitman

52:08.420 --> 52:10.820
Here it is from a cnn report quote

52:10.860 --> 52:16.500
They dealt with it a video game called hitman that he used to watch and it was a video game where you got

52:16.500 --> 52:21.420
Impressions that you would kill somebody hit them from their backside where they were not aware. They were being killed

52:23.060 --> 52:26.180
But I don't know that sounds a little more like manhunt to me but

52:27.460 --> 52:29.460
Regardless this guy's an idiot

52:29.660 --> 52:32.340
Not just for what he did I mean that was stupid anyway

52:32.340 --> 52:36.700
But for the fact that the defense and I guess the defense team wins the stupid award too

52:36.700 --> 52:38.780
But trying to blame it on hitman I

52:39.580 --> 52:41.580
mean come on I

52:41.580 --> 52:47.240
Mean get it's one thing to stab somebody and kill them that way, but like I

52:47.940 --> 52:53.740
That's insane like they like on a scale of one to ten one being like not really fucked up and ten being like super fucked

52:53.740 --> 52:56.580
Up like stabbing someone and killing them is at least twelve okay

52:56.580 --> 53:02.420
That's beyond fucked up, but stabbing them then cutting off their head then burning their body

53:02.700 --> 53:05.840
That's like 11 D billion on that scale okay

53:05.840 --> 53:12.960
so you've got issues, and you need to go away for a long time where we won't see you ever ever again and

53:13.480 --> 53:15.760
Don't try to blame it on a video game ass

53:20.480 --> 53:22.480
Stories like this make me angsty

53:22.480 --> 53:43.360
Oh, you know what happens usually after the stupid award comes about of angst and we like to call that here our f-use of the week

53:43.360 --> 53:46.080
Chuck soccer once you start us off tonight with the f-use of the week

53:46.080 --> 54:00.800
Okay, my f-u of the week goes towards people who drive really really slow like grandma slow

54:00.800 --> 54:05.760
When you're going the speed limit and they're going less than the speed limit

54:05.760 --> 54:10.080
And I know I talk about bad drivers all the time, but oh my god all of them were in front of me today

54:10.080 --> 54:20.480
And also an f-u goes towards the amounts of cleaning I've done in the past week in our house

54:20.480 --> 54:27.200
But I did get something really awesome. I have a toy. I call it the doctor's cleaning tool. It's called a sonic scrubber

54:28.880 --> 54:33.960
Nice and you use it for cars, and I used it for the bathroom instead, but anyway

54:33.960 --> 54:42.160
Just all the dust that got kicked up from all the cleaning I've done for Dan's pinball gathering tonight

54:42.160 --> 54:49.560
Has had my eyes bloodshot like all week, so f-u to dust too

54:49.560 --> 54:53.560
Loki do you have any f-u's of the week?

54:53.560 --> 54:58.560
F-u goes to this chair that I'm sitting on because it's horribly uncomfortable

54:58.560 --> 55:02.560
We will try to find a cheap chair for you at IKEA or something I promise

55:02.560 --> 55:03.960
IKEA has comfy plastic ones

55:03.960 --> 55:06.560
I want to get another chair like that. That chair is awesome the one you sit in

55:06.560 --> 55:10.360
I know they can't see it on just TV because you're secretive, but it's a very nice chair

55:10.360 --> 55:12.360
Sorry, look is that it?

55:12.360 --> 55:14.360
That's it. I got nothing else

55:14.360 --> 55:18.560
F-u to my pancreas which continues to bother me. I've been having chest pains today

55:18.560 --> 55:23.560
Although thankfully I've been getting a little bit better and speaking of food. I actually ate a full meal last night

55:23.560 --> 55:24.160
It was very nice

55:24.160 --> 55:29.960
I went to Mimi's and they have a low fat menu and they have a spaghetti marinara dish

55:29.960 --> 55:33.760
It was actually pretty damn good for low-fat, but I'm so sick of this low-fat diet

55:33.760 --> 55:38.360
I mean granted it's nice to have lost 25 pounds and all but I am so

55:38.560 --> 55:41.960
Sick of eating low-fat like seriously when Loki brought in that pizza tonight

55:41.960 --> 55:49.160
I'm like I would kill you for a slice of pizza Rob. What? I was going to let you know that I

55:50.160 --> 55:52.160
actually do have a good number of

55:52.960 --> 55:59.940
Low fat and low sugar recipes. Oh cool from my phase of South Beach that I would be more than happy to share with you

55:59.940 --> 56:02.060
So you can enjoy some of the food that you're missing good time

56:02.060 --> 56:05.800
So, you know what I'm craving right now though is like I I don't think it's low-fat though

56:05.800 --> 56:07.960
I want like a teriyaki rice bowl or something

56:07.960 --> 56:10.960
I guess just depends on who makes it and how they make it but oh that sounds so good right now

56:13.120 --> 56:13.720
All right

56:13.720 --> 56:18.840
Anyhow enough about food because I'm getting hungry because I haven't eaten dinner yet that will conclude the F use of the week and we'll

56:18.840 --> 56:20.840
Get back into the show

56:20.840 --> 56:22.560
with some more gaming news

56:22.560 --> 56:24.560
well, we've already known that the

56:24.560 --> 56:30.480
You know US and North America. We're gonna be getting a I guess limited-edition

56:31.440 --> 56:36.080
Metal Gear Solid bundle with the game, of course an 80 gig system and

56:38.600 --> 56:45.800
Also, I guess, you know the DualShock 3 controller well now there's also another bundle coming that's gonna be the

56:46.320 --> 56:52.000
Gunmetal gray PlayStation 3. In fact, it was confirmed by Konami's Brandon Loreno

56:52.000 --> 56:59.160
on the official PlayStation blog that this very very limited-edition system will be available in the North America as

56:59.480 --> 57:05.880
Part of a special Metal Gear Solid 4 bundle. So I guess it's the same thing, but this one's Gunmetal

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
You know silver grayish

57:08.800 --> 57:10.800
and

57:11.560 --> 57:17.600
So I guess both these are gonna be scheduled to arrive around the game's release date of June 12th

57:17.600 --> 57:25.480
But I good luck getting your Gunmetal gray they're gonna be super rare basically, yeah super rare

57:25.480 --> 57:29.920
I bet I bet I know something that's even more rare and I know I can say something about this now because Bobby said it

57:29.920 --> 57:31.920
On his show tonight. I can talk about this a little bit

57:32.520 --> 57:36.200
All games radio which you know, we're a part of is going to be giving away

57:36.680 --> 57:41.000
This is super duper rare an Xbox 360 Grand Theft Auto 4

57:41.000 --> 57:48.040
Box, okay. There's only like 500 of these puppies in existence all games got one and they're giving it away and

57:48.720 --> 57:53.760
Base and they're not giving it to you Loki. I'm sorry to say you're ineligible stupid rock star. Listen, okay

57:53.760 --> 57:55.760
I played more of Grand Theft Auto

57:56.680 --> 58:00.520
PSP multiplayer and trust me that's pretty painful

58:00.800 --> 58:04.520
Okay, that game had some pretty bad multiplayer

58:04.520 --> 58:09.800
but I loved it and we played it more than anybody any human on the face of this earth and

58:09.800 --> 58:13.880
Yet, you know, no love for me. What the hell?

58:14.320 --> 58:20.520
Well, here's the way it works on all games radio every show that's on the network gets to pick a finalist

58:20.600 --> 58:23.080
Basically, it gets to do a contest to pick a finalist

58:23.080 --> 58:27.600
So we'll be picking our finalist either next week or the week after but if you don't win with us

58:27.680 --> 58:33.560
You might be able to win with Bobby black wolf. You might be able to win all games interactive video game outsiders

58:34.520 --> 58:37.880
Platform nation, you know one of the you know countless other shows that all games radio has

58:37.880 --> 58:43.440
Everybody is gonna every show is gonna send one finalist to a last round and I don't know what they're gonna do at that point

58:43.440 --> 58:49.120
When the freaking mark echo, I mean, come on, man. They're just like throwing them away now. So stay tuned next week

58:49.120 --> 58:52.680
We'll have more details. We may even do the qualifier next week. I'll post more on the website

58:52.680 --> 58:57.400
I just I have to know the all games timetable either be next week or in two weeks. So we'll see

58:58.280 --> 59:01.720
Okay back to the news. Yes news because ferrets are always

59:02.480 --> 59:04.480
relevant to to my interests

59:04.480 --> 59:12.080
a something else is relevant to my interest is the BBC and the we and they rhyme because the BBC on we is cool we

59:13.440 --> 59:15.440
anyway, so

59:15.760 --> 59:23.440
There is a an I player replay service that the BBC has that's going to be functional on the Wii and the service is

59:23.440 --> 59:25.360
one that

59:25.360 --> 59:30.040
It's actually already available on iPod touch and iPhone that will do

59:30.040 --> 59:36.720
You limited by time different replays of BBC shows including Doctor Who torch wood

59:37.000 --> 59:41.480
Which are two of my favorites and whatever else they want. So, uh, it's actually

59:42.680 --> 59:48.280
It's for we owners in the UK. I actually want to try this on my on my iPhone. I would love to try it

59:49.320 --> 59:56.160
But if anyone wants to actually see what's what's playing on there. The address is BBC co dot UK

59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.600
Slash I player and you can see what they've got up for now. That's pretty sweet

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.360
I was reading this concept a little bit earlier for the show start

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.960
I'm like this is this is a great next step for the Wii

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.320
I mean talking about wanting to be like, you know a centerpiece in the living room with its news and forecasting

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.440
We talk about being able to bring television shows like that

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.620
I mean even more so the next like what if you didn't have to pay for it?

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.720
Well, I mean one thing though that I do want to mention

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.520
that might be a

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:27.440
A problem is that the BBC's website does IP check

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:35.160
For example when the Sarah Jane adventures were just coming out. You actually couldn't even look at their website. It would block it completely and

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.960
About I even use two different IP directors and it still had me blocked

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.520
so but just for what's on there right now as far as featured items is

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.940
Actually the last episode of Doctor Who that aired the other day

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.440
Which was called Pompeii the last day

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.440
There's also

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.520
Not dodi open house to buy or not to buy

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.400
Freaky Eaters

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.280
Dateline London. Yeah, if you care

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.960
There's some pretty good stuff on there love soup. I I would watch a lot of BBC shows

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:13.720
I hope I kind of secretly hope they'd bring it over here and a show little Britain a show that my husband likes is

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.560
Top Gear

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.560
He watches episodes of that on YouTube

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:23.780
Um, but Top Gear is also available to that. It's if you're a big, you know racing or car fanatic. That's a good show

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:30.320
All right, well, we'll see well this is kind of interesting it's been

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.440
How now maybe leaked out on?

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.720
When Animal Crossing for the Wii will be coming out

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.080
apparently

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.600
Apparently there is a calendar available for the club Nintendo

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.640
Folks, and of course, you know for April they have well, I should say they have different games for each month

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.360
The backgrounds and stuff. So for April, of course, they have Mario Kart Wii

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:00.640
Well guess what games in December, of course Animal Crossing

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.140
They have a bunch of picture of the characters and that that could just be a huge coincidence

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.900
Could be but I mean no last game that came out was on the DS and that was around

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.520
November December ish so

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.720
You know, it could be just a coincidence as come out. I'd be interested to see what's on the other months

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.920
You know just to see if that that's that's the thing

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:22.560
Yes, the thing was kind of missing like what are what's in the other months were some of the earlier games from this year in

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.560
The earlier months like did you have you know?

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.000
Smash Brothers brawl for March February, you know, like professor Layton or something for

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.760
February and it is a bit of a stretch, but we'll see well

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.280
We are about to wind down here and we'll be taking Skype calls very soon

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.000
If you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.120
Olr or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.760
Keep in mind that is different from the other all games shows for those of you guys that are new to our show tonight

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.080
Thanks to our new relationship with all games calm keep in mind

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.980
We do have a different phone number than the rest of our shows that are live. Sorry. That's right or interrupt real quick

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:05.840
They actually have someone actually has the calendar and it sounds like it may just be a coincidence because January was Mario Galaxy

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.380
February was we fit but this is all stuff. That's Japanese dates. So, I don't know

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.800
March was Mario Party

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.080
They had April's Mario Kart may looks like they had like Yoshi's Island

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.440
June something Metroid Prime related

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.200
like Kirby

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:30.320
Just all their stuff. Yeah, it's just it sounds like it's just random

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:38.440
All right. Well, this isn't so random. This is very scientific and statistical. It's next generation published a report this week

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.440
It's the top

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.120
100 selling video games of the last two months to 12

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.560
I'm sorry last 12 months not two months last 12 months compiled both across North America and Europe

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.460
Okay, and I promised Jamie some cooking mama

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:57.120
Did you know that cooking mama cook-off is the 98th top selling game in the past 12 months?

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:01.880
Four hundred and seventy K units moved between North America and Europe pretty cool

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.280
That's that's a lot even though the game was kind of crap compared to the DS

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.280
Like it lost a lot of magic on its way to the Wii

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.840
Kind of interesting to lend me yours. You can take it anytime. I'm not I'm not that excited about it

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.160
I'm just quickly looking through the list to see if there's anything else notable on it

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:23.480
I noticed boogie is in at number 87 and I don't know how I felt about boogie. It was a little bit corny

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:29.080
But it's a lot of people. I I know that are casual gamers really like that game, so

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:35.400
Let's see I'll try to wind it down here and just get to some of the top games that sold in the past 12 months

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.240
What do you think what would your guesses be?

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:42.960
What would you say was the number one selling game in the past 12 months just speculating because I know you haven't seen this story yet

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.340
Halo 3 good good choice evil 3 mario Galaxy

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:55.060
Okay, here's the top 10 number 10 was brain age 2 4 million units remember

01:04:55.060 --> 01:05:01.060
This is North America and Europe combined for whatever reason doesn't count Japan though number 9 was Super Mario Galaxy

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:05.020
4.1 million units 8 was Assassin's Creed 4.9

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.800
7 was Pokemon Diamond and Pearl with 5 million 6 was need for speed pro street

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.660
5.4 million 5 was Madden NFL oh 8 5.7 million

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:21.180
4 was FIFA Soccer oh 8 because remember we brought Europe into the mix so you know a soccer game is going to sell

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:28.900
5.7 million as well number 3 this surprised me guitar hero 3 was the number 3 selling game of the past 12 months me I

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.540
Was just because it's so much more expensive

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:37.860
7.5 million units that doesn't surprise me, but I guess you consider all the systems this game is on

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.660
Number 2 Halo 3 8 million units. I was close yeah close

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.140
So you guys are both close the number one game though call of duty for modern warfare

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:55.060
8.3 million units yeah when you hear it, and then you think oh, yeah like seriously. I look at my friends list

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:59.540
There's always someone playing call of duty for always played the hell out of that game

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:04.820
Yeah, it's it's weird though because you know here on orange launch radio. That's not the type of game

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:08.740
We usually talk about it's not the type of thing we play, but I even said that I liked it

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:14.840
Yeah, we saw respect for it certainly weird imagine fashion designers number 66. Oh my God

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:22.700
You know what games not on this list imagine babies know what I have judgment. I have just not on the list that is correct

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:28.460
Good job. Loki. I did so notice some ps3 titles in there like I saw ratchet and clank in there somewhere

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.980
so

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:34.700
Well there you have it one more story then we're going to open up that skype line

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.380
And I don't know how it's going to run tonight

01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:40.460
It might be kind of choppy because we have both justin TV and this higher bitrate streaming

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:45.620
I will have to can justin TV during this segment if we have problems just you know we got one more story

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:51.640
And it's a sweet one right Jamie. Yeah, it's really sweet and sappy makes my teeth hurt, but it's really cool

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:59.700
There is a guy and let me make sure that I pronounced his name correctly Brian Clema. I guess Clema kale I am a

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.900
who

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:05.240
by his own account made a custom level in

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:12.280
Super Smash Brothers Brawl this says Marry me and put the timer to infinite put peach Mario and

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:20.080
Kirby who is his intended fiancee's favorite character and just left the TV on so when she came home and turned on the TV

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.040
she's like oh, you're in the middle of the game, and then she saw that he had the ring in hand and

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:29.200
Look, he said look at TV again. She said yes, so I thought it was sweet. Oh

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.880
That's cute, and she proceeded to own him in Smash Bros. Brawl

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.880
I don't see how anyone can play on the Marry me level though

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:43.260
It'd be really freaking difficult to actually get out of the top part and land somewhere

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.160
You can beat somebody else up

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.400
You should put that level up for download for all the other nerds who want to do something like that

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:51.040
That's the Marry me level up. I'll tell you what though the best engagement story

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.860
I ever heard was dark soccer is that was my favorite tell the all-games crowd

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.740
Your engagement over a particular movie. I love this story

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.440
Dan and I

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:08.360
We well we had known each other. You know online for quite a while and when I moved out here we on

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:15.000
Valentine's day we were watching UHF. We were you know kind of broke. I didn't have a job and he was

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.680
working telemarketing somewhere, but

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:23.280
we were watching UHF and eating French baguettes and

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:31.920
Spinach dip and drinking that the kosher blackberry wine. I love how you remember every detail. It's so girly, but cute

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:35.240
Oh, shut up. I remember lots of details about lots of stuff and

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:43.920
We just sort of mutually decided to get married it was like we should get married okay when sometime okay, I

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:50.440
Just think the fact you got married over UHF is so funny. We're now brought us together. It's time to drink from the firehose

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.200
Yeah

01:08:53.200 --> 01:09:01.480
Marvel in the oatmeal you should have had that at your wedding the firehose we didn't actually have a

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.800
Wedding yeah, but at your you know you should have at least you know outside the courthouse

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.600
Black corset and a purple skirt and boots

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.680
When I got married it's awesome

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:21.400
And then I had cake and it was good and then and then we went home, and I slept in the next day

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.080
Okay

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.880
Romantic odd one in chat says God if I had a nickel for every time I got laid because of UHF and

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:35.760
DJ Morpheus you'd owe money. Yeah DJ Morpheus follows up with a zinger you'd owe five bucks

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.800
What's that old saying great minds think like me no Dan says it great minds think like us all right

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.080
Skyplines open one eight seven seven game. Oh LR again. I apologize a little bit experimental

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.760
We'll see how this first call works out. Hi. You're on orange lounge radio. Who's this?

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.440
Hello GS 68 what is on your mind my friend

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:05.200
Um I have a question for a low low key about my currently all right. What's up?

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.720
Logie or what's up GS 68 for Loki?

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:13.400
Um have you played online yet? Yes?

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:25.000
Um how's the online like if someone disconnects will they will they get replaced by CPU without you knowing like in Brawl?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:32.260
I don't think anyone disconnected in the ones that I played, but like you can choose you know between matches or whatever

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.900
To leave or continue on to another race or something like that

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.960
It's just sometimes a little difficult to get connected

01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:44.800
And it's kind of cool that once you're like if you're waiting in queue to you know join up the next game

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:51.080
You actually watch the other people playing their games, so you can kind of switch between different cart views and stuff like that

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.960
But I didn't actually see anyone get disconnected off there, so I don't know

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.360
I'd assume they they would lose points

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:06.580
Because the way the rankings work you start off with 5,000 points when you first start playing and then depending on where you place

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:11.020
um within the 12 you'll lose up to like

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:18.980
64 points and then gain maybe 64 points, so I'd imagine if if they disconnected whatever

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.300
No, sorry go ahead

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:25.100
I'm

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:29.500
Carroms saying that they can't hear me. I have to mic turn all the way up you were a little quiet

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.820
But that's okay. It might be on our end. Just keep talking don't listen. Don't let them bully you in chat. Oh

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.820
oh

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:43.260
Anyways, that's what turns me off from playing Super Smash Bros. Online in the with anyone mode cuz if

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:50.940
The game will disconnect you a game will please disconnect with a CPU and not tell you what's the point of playing online anymore?

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:56.500
I mean, I'm gonna just play against three CPU characters honestly gs68 there really wasn't one

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.360
And I think they just put it in as an afterthought to say they did it

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:04.660
That's my honest answer because it sounds like Mario Kart we has a much more robust type of online like I didn't even know it

01:12:04.660 --> 01:12:06.900
Had that whole like ranking it has leaderboards

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:11.660
I have like a bunch of stuff and you can look at your friends and see where they are like you know the different times

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.980
And stuff you can download the top you know

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.860
Rankers their ghost data and race it if you want to

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:24.580
But not all that stuff works too. Well right now because of you know they're getting hammered

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:30.300
So like trying to download ghost data didn't work for me. I I tried a few times, and it didn't work in fact

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.180
I had to hammer online and finally get into a game

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:39.780
It took me about 10 tries, and I finally got to play an online game, but well you know that'll get fixed eventually

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.380
I'm sure but right now. It's just you know getting hammered pretty bad

01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:49.060
All right any other comments gs68 or questions oh?

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:54.820
Yeah, I'm you didn't nominate any games for all our March Madness right you know we send in our lists later

01:12:54.820 --> 01:13:00.100
We we got in there late, so we weren't in on the nomination process for all our March Madness and just for the benefit because

01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:04.180
Folks who only listen to us in the podcast may not know and all games folks may not know

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:10.180
DMN one of our other personalities from the old orange launch radio station kind of was rounding up this March Madness

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.820
Competition but involving video games. I'll be honest. It's very similar to the type of thing

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:20.660
You've probably seen on game facts in the past, but it wasn't with characters

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:21.300
It was with games

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:26.180
And he was trying to find the best game of all time of which super Metroid ended up winning last week

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.580
For which I got called every name in the book because I it was separated by one vote

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:35.380
Yes, even amongst all the chatters all the hosts in studio of which we had quite a few guests last week

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:40.220
It was separated by one vote and I cast the deciding vote to make super Metroid win over Chrono Trigger

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:42.220
And I took a lot of shit for it

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:47.500
But yeah, we did not actually send in the qualifier list because DMN closed it off early

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:49.940
But what would you want to ask about that? Yeah?

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:58.420
Yeah, what I would like ask him like our listeners like what games they wish she had nominated but I

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.780
mean that's

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.500
What I mean some games that are very

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.300
big like we're on the brackets and

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.580
So basically like I see that the kind of thing like you know what was missing

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:16.420
What should have been there? What what wasn't on the brackets that should have been? I think honestly you'd I?

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:20.380
Think the sampling was a pretty good sampling of like you know the

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:28.020
Mainstream best games that there were out there. I think honestly you would be diving into everyone's niche gaming

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:33.060
To see what it is they missed you know if you're an RPG fan you probably said oh

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:39.860
Where was grandia or where was you know some some niche RPG if you're a racing game fan?

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:41.860
You were probably like oh, where was you know?

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:45.780
Burnout or whatever it is so well

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:52.220
I mean I surprised to see that like obscure games like massive to the allegiance are the brackets yet

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:59.780
I gave like Castlevania simply that which is what which did so much pretty Castlevania series it what it basically took

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.540
To

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.020
the action

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:09.540
They can buy 2d action adventure gameplay RPG elements like that game was not on there

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.380
Yeah, Castlevania is one of my favorite games, too

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.900
You know if I'd nominated it would have been definitely in my top five

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.380
But I got to finish this up because we can move on to other calls

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.820
But I will say this we might try it again in a few months

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.140
Let the dust settle a little bit

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:27.420
Maybe when there's another thing going on now that we have the additional resources of all games comm maybe we can do something a little

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:33.980
More epic and maybe a little more inclusive of everybody's tastes so, but we'll see it's gonna be interesting though

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.540
Cuz when you throw like if we were to do something all-encompassing of all games

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:43.540
You know you take a show like all games interactive and a lot of those folks are really into the sports titles and the call

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.180
Of duties and the things we don't give enough time to on this show

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:51.260
So I think it would be very interesting to bring those two worlds together and see what still comes out on top

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:54.780
We'll see what happens gs68 we got to let you go so we can get some more calls him

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:58.140
But thanks so much for the phone call buddy. All right. Take care. All right all right

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:00.480
We're gonna take some more calls one eight seven seven game

Don't know I think it well. I don't know cuz the last call went okay. Yeah

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:50.060
I don't know people are just having technical difficulties all right

We'll give it one more try if you want to give us a call here on orange launch radio

01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:57.220
The lines are open now that last call didn't go so well, so I have to edit that out

I really want to thank everybody who's tuning in tonight both Bobby black wolf before us and us we have

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:40.740
Exceeded more live listeners than we've ever had

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.100
Ever it's with the exception of e3 specials. We've done with brought in more people, but

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:52.460
Who knew the voltron of podcasting would work both Bobby and us are benefiting from this so big about it is amazing

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.260
Cross-promotion, that's awesome work. It was

01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:04.180
Surprised you guys didn't do it soon enough it did slide through 65. You know probably like a year. You know you're earlier

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.380
I mean yeah hindsight is always 20 20 isn't it look you got a question. What's on your mind?

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:15.580
Basically all right since I managed to get a PSP last Friday and managed to get a hat

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:20.260
I need some good. You know some good apps. Okay. I mean you I

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:26.100
Know you got to help me out with a little bit of something, but why else can I put on my PSP?

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:28.420
Turn the homebrew

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.420
What now I'm sorry I?

01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.780
Can't I couldn't understand him

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.940
Um I just heard I just turned down the bandwidth on Justin TV

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:40.060
So hopefully we'll get a little better. He wants to know like PSP apps. He should have I don't know

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:45.820
I haven't downloaded anything in a long time. I guess emulators. I mean that's kind of cool, but uh you know PSP radio, maybe

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.700
I

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:50.940
Don't know

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.940
Really downloaded a number

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.700
I

01:18:54.700 --> 01:19:00.180
Know Zaku you should get the you you should get the PSP radio thing in the latest firmware

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:03.620
And you can listen to all games radio now on the PSP radio anywhere you go

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:10.140
You got you got the latest firmware hacks already got that one actually

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:14.660
Zaku you reminded me of something and it didn't make our show roll tonight, but did you see this?

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:21.380
Loki I'm curious if you saw this Sony sent out a poll earlier this week basically asking people. Why do you hack the PSP?

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.620
Yes, I kind of try. Why do you hack?

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:30.340
The basically they sent out a poll saying like you know and it asked people to rate things on a scale like one to seven

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:32.300
Going like you know yes, I agree or no

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:32.740
I don't agree

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:38.260
You know like I hack my PSP because I like the challenge or I hack my PSP to give it features of the PSP

01:19:38.260 --> 01:19:41.100
I have my PSP to steal games kind of interesting

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:44.900
I

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.900
Hack it just to spite you

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.020
How about how about a couple good websites?

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:53.980
Zaku can keep an eye on because really it's about what you want to do with the PSP so had a couple good websites for

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:56.100
I guess psphacks.com

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.460
pspupdates.qj.net

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:07.020
Stuff like that I mean those would be two websites I'd check they have a lot of downloads on there and stuff

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:08.820
right

01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:13.260
I just barely had trouble today. Just getting some proper emulators. You know

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:19.040
But you know at least I know people you know like you Loki and other folks that can you know help me out

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:25.360
That's good. You gotta get back on that scene. I mean three latest M33 is pretty damn good right now

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.160
Especially when your PSP is overclocked

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:32.080
Alright Zaku we got to let you go so we can get more calls any quick final thoughts

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:37.360
I'm gonna get your PSP hacked. Don't leave you. You know fuck Sony's

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:43.320
Endurance all right. Just know somebody went up in door, but battery. That's all you need to know all right

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:45.440
It's all about the battery take care, buddy

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:52.600
1 8 7 7 game olr. I'm hoping our next call will be a little better with the bandwidth because I dropped Justin TV a lot

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.160
In the video they're probably just seeing a still picture in there right now. Hello. You're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.360
Hi guys, this is footy monster. See that's a lot quicker

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.680
It was like no and the footy monsters in Argentina, so we might just have to do that every week on just TV anyway

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:10.240
Sorry, we're learning about our show live. What's on your mind footy monster noise at all

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:15.640
I just want to share a couple of things for a quick first off congrats on your new home. Thank you

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.360
We like it. Hey quick dark Sakura put some of the nice silverware here from all games in your purse

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.120
Okay

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.880
All right, sorry, what's up?

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.480
Well, you know that story you had earlier about Brazil and the whole bully thing

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
Yes, I do well

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.720
Here's the thing as far as understand since it's pretty close from here

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:43.120
The only country that I know that's in South America that has any sort of official distribution of anything is actually Chile

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.500
And they have Microsoft like Sony doesn't release anything officially and Nintendo doesn't release anything officially

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.720
Argentina used to have official distribution of Nintendo products, but those that was like in 1995

01:21:54.160 --> 01:22:00.620
So I'm thinking and and this is just a theory that you know anything that happens in Brazil

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:05.380
Rockstar will never care for because it's not that they were sending their game to Brazil

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:12.180
Because they are not doing it. It's just you know retailers importing the game and having a great market so to speak um

01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:17.220
You know what's interesting though is that it's interesting in Nintendo doesn't support

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.220
South America more because like I was just kind of noticing

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:24.220
I was just looking at some of the box art on a recent game drew was here last week

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:28.340
And he gave me back super paper Mario because he borrowed it and I was just kind of eyeing the back of the box

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.540
And kind of noticing how like it's interesting on Nintendo

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:35.740
Puts the back of their boxes in three different languages all at once now like you look at the back of a box of a

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:40.580
Nintendo game it's in English French and Spanish all in the back, but you read some of the fine print yes

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:46.980
I was very bored it talks about how the game is only for distribution in the United States Canada hence the French and

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.240
Latin America they say hence the span of Latin America is like Puerto Rico

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.820
Which is basically the u.s.. And Mexico is basically the u.s.. Which well

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:59.100
I think some of our Mexican listeners might disagree, but but

01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.700
Yeah, but at the same time the distribution of products

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:06.380
I do find it interesting because then they're basically saying well Latin America is just Mexico

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.560
It is kind of interesting that they are cutting off the rest of the countries south of Mexico

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.620
Well, no not really. I mean considering the economies that we have here. It's not that surprising

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:19.940
I mean who's over here what you have to spend to play a game?

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:25.860
I mean I was just the other day at the shop buying a 360 game well attempting to and it was like 90 US dollars

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:32.580
So I'm not gonna go buy a game for that price, so if Nintendo had to officially release their games support the region

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.740
We think the prices of games are gonna be

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:42.300
You know and they I mean they're not gonna sell at what people here could buy because they will have no profit and even worse

01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:47.620
You know people from the US would import from South America, and it's the same thing right and pay cheaper true

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.760
It would never work. I guess that's true. I

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:53.940
Guess we had to get the realist perspective so in the mean in the meantime

01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.220
How are you getting your games footy remind our listeners? How do you get your games?

01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:03.100
Do you just have to pay the mark up or do you import or what actually I got a 360 quite recently I?

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:10.080
Probably January, and I had the option of flashing the bias and just you know like lucky

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.980
Look at us in one of his 360s and part of my games

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:18.960
But I actually really like the live experience, and I actually bit the bullet then whenever I go to Chile games

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:25.460
They're a pretty and another cheap, but they're competitive prices with the u.s.. I seen I could buy Mass Effect with 50 bucks

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.800
Or the other day I found lost Odyssey for 45 bucks

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.900
Oh nice, so you know it's like the prices are even sometimes

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.320
They're even cheaper like a god deal a for new seal for 20 bucks, so

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:41.980
What I could what I did is just actually go there because I have family there and whenever I make a trip

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.060
I just bring two or three games with me. You know because here. It's like $100, but over there

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:52.660
It's since Microsoft official distributes the games. It's totally you know possible to actually buy original games so right now

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:57.820
I'm buying original games and just doing it on ps2. I had to back. You know buy backups

01:24:57.820 --> 01:25:00.980
That's all you could do and on my DS. It's I do the same thing

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.260
It's very interesting footy to hear you kind of talking openly about

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:09.820
Pirating games which you know has ruffled some feathers in the past here on this show with some of our listeners who are against pirating

01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.820
Which you know I understand

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:13.820
Let me let me make this straight

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:18.140
It's interest, but it's interesting though footy when it's your only option

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.500
You know like you're talking about I mean

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:25.620
It's that or smuggle your games from Chile or not play games because really I mean just because you don't have money

01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:30.460
Your option is not stealing. You know I do because I am fully aware that I'm doing something

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.800
That's not entirely legal or morally you know correct, but I have that better

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.540
I will this is a small anecdote here when I was a kid

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.340
I used to go to a computer shop to get my computer games in floppy disks

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:45.820
And I would go my floppy disk that I would buy in a box at a retailer

01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:49.580
Go there, and you know look at through a list of games and ask them for a game

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:53.780
And they would I would pay them and I would go home to me that was totally normal and reasonable

01:25:53.780 --> 01:26:00.940
That was how you got games right only later. I understood that that's illegal, but that was the way you did it here

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.900
Hmm, so there's another culture of original games here there. I mean really there isn't

01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:11.940
So that's part of the problem as well piracy is just so rampant you know that it's like the way it is

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.860
It's like go to China and say you know with the same argument. It will not work

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:19.460
I guess it's so interesting to hear from around the world kind of the way things work because sometimes

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.620
We're in our little bubbles in these other countries

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:26.220
We live in so what I love about the internet and doing these podcasts and talking to people from around the world as you get

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:28.660
To hear you to hear from gamers everywhere footy

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:31.280
We got to wrap up and let you go, but anything else you want to say to our listeners

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:34.780
That's pretty much it guys. I guess I'll talk to you later. All right. Good luck footy. Take care

01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:36.780
YouTube

01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.720
Smuggles his games from Chile amazing

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.100
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.860
This is the excuse next to be a second time and hopefully more stable way

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:54.140
Then you sound millions light-years better hello, Tony. I know you sound telephony probably cuz he's on the telephone

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:59.040
He's on the 877, but that's all right. Yeah, what's on you? I blame Skype. I blame Vista. I blame

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.860
I calm crap and you know everything else I can blame. It's not my life is five. Don't forget to blame them. Oh

01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:11.420
Yeah, sure by 365 screw the RA the older fault. All right, and the police. All right

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.200
Jason what's on your mind?

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:17.460
Two short things and one quick thing

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.980
And one longer thing. Did you know that they made an impossible mission remake on the Wii?

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:28.320
Yes in Europe. Where is it here? I want it. Gimme gimme gimme

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:35.340
On my video game shelf come over and play it sometime. Shut up. Did you import it from Europe?

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:43.060
No, it was in the we went to Best Buy we were checking out and it was just sitting in those discount bins

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.540
What I looked at it

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:50.680
I laughed it said I'm getting this and bid and I've already played it then the game must come out here under the radar. I

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:57.840
Yeah, it doesn't have any it's obviously not all it works on our TV without anything special, you know

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.840
You use freeloader any of that stuff, right?

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:04.920
Well shit, I'm gonna go get but I'm gonna go pick that up tomorrow then. All right, cool

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.880
Thanks for the heads up. Hold up. Well, I didn't even know it came out here. That's great

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.400
It's cuz it didn't it did it did not it only came out in the DS

01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:19.560
Yeah possible mission DS 10 bucks on Amazon. All right. Well, we'll see I'm gonna have to pick it just cuz I'm sure

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:24.840
It plays like crack at the box. I'll look for more logos. I will take a picture and show you guys

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.560
I it's not that I don't believe you. Oh here. Here's the best way to tell

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:34.080
Here's the best way to tell Jason see if it has a rating an ESRB rating on it because if it doesn't oh, yeah

01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:38.240
Then it's different overseas. Aha. That's the way to tell. So anyway, what was the other?

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.280
What was the other story with little or what was the other story right now?

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.080
But the I'd barely they're watching Mulan Roo, so it's kind of noisy out there and I want to make too much of a ruckus

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.560
No, what are they singing? What are they singing along? No

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.080
But I heard them laughing uncontrollably just a minute ago. So good enough. I guess Oh girls

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.600
All right. Oh, yes, of course

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:04.440
I completely forgot what the second thing is. So I'll just skip to the last thing. All right farms is exceedingly intelligent

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:06.760
Yes, he is. I

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.040
Was obviously listening to the interview since I made it back in time to be able to listen to the show

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:17.840
And the discussion along the lines of XNA and we wear and everything opening up new opportunities. It's

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:26.100
Opening up another avenue for developers of the sort to showcase their talent, but it's not going to be a

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:32.080
It's going to be the same thing with indie and underground games. We already have through a different medium

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.480
It's you know, so the ones that are really good

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:41.560
There will be that one game and then the talent from the studio or just a or just a specific individuals can be hired

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.920
Onto a big-name studio and the cycles going to continue

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.240
It's a it's a great new app a new absolutely

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:54.680
But it's not going to fundamentally change the landscape of indie games being easily accessible and open to everybody and it was just very

01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:02.200
Interesting to hear somebody else. I mean go figure developer especially was it's very interesting to hear him say the exact same thoughts

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.280
That I would have on such a thing. It's a great thing, but it doesn't change the landscape, but and

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:11.760
Plus the fact that you know, he's in another country too. So you kind of get you know, that whole thing

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.800
I was just talking about with footy monster hearing from gamers around the world hearing

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.500
It's still the same idea over there. Not that there's you know, obviously all the all the companies are in Australia doing business

01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:26.480
It's it's not that radically different from what it is over here in Europe or what have you but still still interesting that it all

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.380
Comes to that kind of same thought. I I don't know

01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:33.760
Maybe I blew the XNA thing out of proportion a little bit when we first heard it about it on the show

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:40.040
But I still think it's going to be a pretty radical, you know, it's just like YouTube didn't change the internet

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.280
Completely, but it had a great impact that was felt

01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:47.320
you know what I mean and live people know what YouTube is and where I

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:52.380
Honestly think XNA is going to be a YouTube of sorts for gaming. That's kind of how I feel

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:58.080
Did you play those little community XNA what two-week trial games that they had up there? Yeah, some of them were fun

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:05.800
Yes, yes that they were it's I don't know that it's gonna have the same I completely understand your comparison

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:08.880
but I don't think it's gonna have the same impact as YouTube just because

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.400
Gamers the the XNA toolkit as I've talked to Bobby about the past and other various things

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:20.900
Apparently the XNA toolkit is exceedingly interesting, but it doesn't lower the bar YouTube lowered the bar

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:24.740
You take a video clicking the buttons and you're done. I guess that's true. This is

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:31.380
Yeah, this is very special and it is a great Avenue, but it's not gonna fundamentally change everything

01:31:31.380 --> 01:31:32.140
So, okay

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:32.820
I you know

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:37.060
I am comparing apples to oranges a little bit but I still kind of think that whole concept where it's gonna be a lot

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:40.460
Easier for the people that can do it to get their stuff out there because you know

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.960
You look at some of those little trial games that came out, you know games like the dishwasher

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:50.300
Jelly car were yards better than Yaris. You know what I mean? They were a while ago

01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:54.580
It's the loop and some of the other, you know, there's been some other junk on expo

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:59.940
I hate to say it but the Tron ports weren't all that great like they could have done better and some of the other classic

01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:01.940
Game ports, you know what I mean?

01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:06.060
Yeah, I just think you know put it put these new game developers me interesting

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:11.820
these new games can certainly hold a candle to classic remakes and

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:14.480
Shit like yours. Yeah

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.560
Jason we got a wrap up here so we can sign off for the night. It's already midnight 30 on the East Coast

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:23.400
Do you have any quick final thoughts for us? I

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:29.200
Wish I knew with all I wanted to say, but I forgot so good night. Well, you can always call us next week

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320
Good night. Absolutely. Bye

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:37.480
Our fearless webmaster VX Jason XV. We love him here on the program. That's gonna do it for the skype line tonight

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.840
Sorry to those didn't get through we can always try again next week

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.960
We're gonna wrap up the show. But first we got to get some last-minute news

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.440
I'm gonna check in with Loki and see if there's any last-minute news

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.360
Not really much but it's kind of interesting it looks like

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:57.000
There's a hacking group blaze team that has released a hacked

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.640
We virtual console game that they've broken the encryption on so that's a whole

01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.320
Big old can of worms that Nintendo probably doesn't want opened

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:09.560
and

01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:13.960
Then there's some other interesting things castle

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.360
Crashers, it looks like it's gonna have some new characters including a bear that fights with a fish and

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:29.560
You also I guess get little I don't know helper pets or something like that. They have a floating cat

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.120
It's kind of funny. I can't wait for this game to come out a

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:40.800
A floating cap. Yeah, it's an animal orb. It says the cat who will add to your agility and strength

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:44.760
Interesting I

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.760
Don't know. It's it's cute

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:53.980
Rosteel UT says the ESRB org lists impossible mission for DS PS 2 PSP and we I gotta go look for that

01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:00.240
They have yeah scratch paws the cat which is a cute name for a cat scratch paw. I'll let a cute

01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.600
they also have

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:06.360
There are some other pictures in here. They have like a little bird and a dog and

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.120
I

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:14.860
Don't know. It's just it's just all on a dev blog dot the behemoth calm

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:18.480
And you can check out like they show off the different weapons and stuff

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:22.400
Was it the barbarian axe fish?

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.340
They have a thin sword skinny sword thick sword pumpkin peeler

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:33.520
And the different characters for castle crashers looks like

01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.540
well the bear and then

01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.460
periwinkle night and

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:48.060
You know other than and they're gonna have a lot of characters to play as that games gonna be fucking awesome can't wait

01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:56.380
That's really it I think didn't we talked about games for Windows magazines going online only yeah

01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:02.180
I think so, but yeah, it is it's kind of the way magazines are going right now anyway. Yeah, I had to say

01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:07.340
All right, we're gonna wrap up. We're running pretty long tonight on our first all-game show, but that's all right

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:10.660
We had a good time. We had farms on the show. We had lots of folks

01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:13.460
Let's go around in gear base final thought dark soccer your final thought

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.500
It's hot in here

01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:21.340
It's getting cooler. It's cooling down as the night goes on low-key your final thought. It's hot and humid in here

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:27.740
My final thought is you guys are babies. It's not that bad in here. No is getting pretty bad

01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:30.220
hopefully we get an AC next week and and and and

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:33.660
We gonna
