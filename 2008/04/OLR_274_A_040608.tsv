14676	23304	Tonight, we say goodbye to Live365, we say hello to AllGames.com, and as always, we make fun of the latest in gaming news.
32372	36635	Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36675	43059	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
43139	44680	My name is Rob Roberts.
45101	48663	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
49244	49864	Hi.
49964	50544	How are you doing?
52145	52866	Hi.
52986	53406	Okay.
54527	55308	I'm doing okay.
55508	55708	Good.
56468	58770	Say hello as well to TechMasterLoki.
59070	59390	Hello.
59971	60431	How are you doing?
60691	61252	I'm doing okay.
61452	61712	All right.
62452	64194	I'm glad to hear you're okay and not crappy
88982	89503	And no one's here.
89843	91084	I don't want to say goodbye.
91104	92165	You know what I want to say?
92445	92665	What?
92925	93626	Fuck you!
94787	98250	Well, I sent the official cancellation notice today, so there's no turning back now.
98590	99311	It's a done deal.
100311	101152	They're bastards.
101592	102213	Oh, I know.
102293	103314	They shouldn't have upped the rates.
103394	104535	But, oh well.
105589	107251	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
128789	129549	Dark Tetsuya Episode 1
154093	154333	Ragnarokan
181221	188865	As usual, and we have started working on cleaning up the pinball machines because Dan's having a pinball party next Sunday.
190766	192567	That sounds like fun, a pinball party, huh?
192587	195749	We're having a bunch of people over the house, it's like everybody wants to meet you.
195829	196930	It's like, well, too bad.
197430	199671	What exactly happens at a pinball party?
200152	201072	Pizza and pinball.
202373	202653	Oh, okay.
203013	204074	That sounds pretty good.
204114	207376	And then people talk about their collections and stuff.
207436	209757	It's just like, look how pretty my pinball tables are.
210507	212568	Are people actually going to bring pinball tables over?
212628	213888	Okay, I was going to say they're not very portable.
213908	215569	No, but we have plenty, I think.
217210	217970	Well, here's my question.
218010	226433	Are you going to have not just the pinball machines, but maybe like Pinball FX on the TV on Xbox Live?
226973	227333	I don't know.
227353	228874	You know what you can do on Life 365?
229114	230234	Shit, you can do shit.
232295	235416	I was going to suggest that he hook up the Nintendo and put in Pinbot.
236237	236757	Ah, there you go.
237409	240231	and maybe we can hook up the TurboGrafx and put in Devil's Crush.
241432	242473	Okay, good idea.
242493	248598	And he picked up one of those classic collections too, like the whatever super awesome of pinball.
249939	254763	And to ShadowScyler, I play on Essence RO, but you won't ever find me.
255323	256264	I haven't made the guild yet.
256685	258646	How about Sonic Spinball?
259607	260448	I could do that.
260628	261468	I've got Sonic Spinball.
261488	263310	Because that was a very strange pinball game.
264570	268438	it reminded me of that part of Casino Night where I'd get stuck and get pissed off
269525	270886	DarkSakura, which server do you Ragnarok on?
299261	300381	That's what I answered.
300921	302822	I said that I play on the Essence server.
302942	304462	I'm sorry, I was on crack.
304782	307463	Kanti says, how many pinball machines does DarkSakura have?
308423	311924	Okay, now I have to think about which ones are actually mine because we're holding some for some people.
312644	318105	So the ones that we're holding is a Brite of Pinbot, an Indiana Jones that Dan is shopping out.
318625	325606	We are holding a Back to the Future and a Black Knight, not Black Knight 2000.
325646	326487	I wish I had that one.
327567	327867	And then...
329954	345123	Star Trek The Next Generation, No Fear, Twilight Zone, Simpsons Pinball Party, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and my machine, World Cup Soccer 94.
345503	349065	Did I say Twilight Zone?
349105	349946	Yeah, we have Twilight Zone.
351447	351847	Alright.
352747	355869	It seems like things have changed a lot since the last time even I was over there.
356590	357090	That's crazy.
358746	360887	Alright, so Loki, how was your gaming week?
362488	364149	As he sits down, ready to go.
364509	367430	My gaming week was pretty brief.
368271	372513	I played pretty much just Saints Row this entire week, I think.
373353	373613	Yes.
375494	378976	But it's finished now, so that's good.
379716	385219	And, well, I'm still not 100% in the game because I have to do all the damn activities, and some of them are fucking impossible, but
386567	388068	As far as the story goes, I'm done.
390010	391551	Never knew what the ending was anyway, so.
392312	397216	But I'm glad I'm done so I can start Saints Row 2 when that comes out and Grand Theft Auto 4 and all that fun stuff.
399017	399398	That's it.
400038	401860	Wow, that's a relatively short week for you.
402080	403701	Well, I played a lot of Saints Row.
403721	405883	I mean, we played the death matches during lunch.
406483	412368	I had a funny moment where I was driving on the sky in Saints Row because the game is a little glitchy sometimes.
412889	413589	So that was fun.
414670	414850	And...
416291	417271	I don't know, that's about it.
434265	435726	It's stupid, but funny.
435927	437368	One of those stupid, funny things.
438709	440370	So obviously, don't take that too seriously.
440410	442191	The game takes a minute and a half to beat.
444533	446395	Besides that, really not a lot.
446435	448276	I played Mr. Driller for like 10 minutes.
450569	452470	The new one on Xbox Live Arcade.
452770	453551	I'm sorry.
453771	456092	Well, yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.
456172	468400	I was kind of like, I wonder what version they ported because I was surprised to see, and maybe it's just because it's the mechanics of the game or whatever, but I was surprised to see that the playing field was only a really small portion of the screen.
468680	471101	I don't know if maybe that's to support the multiplayer or what have you.
471121	472342	Did you get to play online?
472362	473543	Which is probably a lot more fun.
473623	475724	No, I'm completely basing my judgment off the demo.
476024	476564	Thanks for watching!
496626	499148	I didn't play a lot of games this week, but I have a valid excuse.
499288	501790	I'll talk about this real quick because a lot of people have been asking.
502890	508194	The reason why Part B went up on Saturday this week, which is extremely late for Part B to go up.
508214	510995	We tried to get it up on Wednesday, like Thursday at the absolute latest.
511035	511716	I've got something going on.
512676	520019	I was in the hospital for three days this week, and it was mentioned on OrangeLunchRadio.com, you probably saw that, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.
521280	528183	I don't know how much I've mentioned it on the live show, but I've been having abdominal pains on and off for the past three weeks.
528723	532086	and finally it kind of reached a head on Wednesday.
532707	538953	I got woken up by some horrendous chest pain and it was like alien is going to pop out of my chest bad.
539414	541215	So I finally just went to the ER.
541356	543338	I was kind of getting the run around from my doctors.
544619	549924	They had diagnosed me with pancreatitis but didn't seem to be doing much about it and finally I had to go to the hospital.
551607	557870	Yeah, that's where I spent about three days pretty much because what I had was acute pancreatitis.
557930	564554	Basically, my pancreas is fucked up and it was producing too much of a certain chemical and it makes it really painful to eat fatty foods.
565054	571077	It most commonly happens, funny enough, it most commonly happens in luscious, people who drink a lot, alcoholics.
571881	573622	Like 80% of the cases are alcoholics.
573662	583387	Now, while I enjoy the occasional beverage and I talk about it here on this program, I would say drinking one, maybe two drinks a week does not make me an alcoholic.
583787	584968	So alcohol didn't cause it.
585368	586769	And being fat didn't cause it.
587009	594613	I thought that maybe the fact that I ate out a lot and all that stuff might have caused me to go to the hospital, but that wasn't it either.
597194	599516	My triglycerides were too low for that to be the case.
600016	600136	So...
601402	602363	That was not the case either.
605146	606226	So they don't know what caused it.
606967	613593	And now the thing is that, and I don't want to be into too much of a downer syndrome or whatever, but folks have been asking.
614173	618717	The weird thing is that they did a CAT scan, they did an MRI and all this shit on me in the hospital.
619397	622340	I have some type of cyst on my pancreas, apparently, and
623123	625385	Thank God it's not cancer, says the doctor.
646121	651966	So I don't mean to bring the show down, but that's basically where I was all week, and since folks have been asking, that's what's up.
652427	656430	I find the toughest part of all of it is, A, the fact that I didn't do anything to cause it.
656550	659293	It's one of those cases where really they don't know what caused it.
660514	668721	They think it could be an allergy to the medication I took, although if that's the case, I will be one of the first documented cases of that kind of allergy, like ever, to this antibiotic I took.
669082	670363	They also say that stress is a cause.
671147	672248	I'm not that stressed out, though.
672948	675170	Things are pretty good in my life right now, all things considered.
675430	679634	Sure, the Life 365 thing sucks, but it's not going to cause me to go to the hospital bad.
679714	680134	You know what I mean?
680875	681335	So I don't know.
682616	682956	I don't know.
683316	684097	It's really bad.
686357	689860	So, yeah, my only thing is I'm always afraid it's going to come back.
690340	691982	But I've lost a crazy amount of weight.
692122	694304	In the past month, I've lost 21 pounds.
695164	699868	So, to put it, and you probably notice if you're on Justin.TV because my pants, like, won't stay on.
699928	701330	It's kind of sexy.
701470	702010	No, I'm just kidding.
702491	704532	All right, I'll stop being such a downer now.
705473	706573	Hey guys, coming in clearly I hope?
706593	706733	Alright.
729395	730155	Introduce yourself.
730696	731656	It's Drew Nami, of course.
732096	732757	It's Drew Nami.
733037	733377	Of course.
733557	735058	And you were here episode one, weren't you?
735838	737119	I was not here episode one.
737159	741701	But you were listening episode one, and now you're here for the last show on Live 365.
741781	743182	Well, not the last, last show.
743342	746503	I remember episode one, I was listening from New York.
747283	747403	Ah.
747784	748604	So how was your gaming week?
748624	751205	We're going to get that mic a little closer to you while you talk about your gaming week.
751405	752646	Yeah, you move a little closer.
752706	755247	I don't know what happened to Irene, so we'll wait for her later.
755547	756328	Well, how was your gaming week?
756568	759069	Well, I've been on my wild methadone.
759537	762019	What's so exciting about the most recent Guild Wars expansion?
785123	788845	and you get a whole bunch of new missions, new skills, basically new everything.
789186	792548	And it all leads into... Yeah, they're still saying you're really quiet.
792568	793468	Go ahead and just pick up the mic.
793508	794109	Just hold it away.
794129	794909	It's away from your mouth.
796370	797611	Live radio, folks.
798452	798932	It happens.
799993	801073	Did you play on April 1st?
802374	804316	Yeah, did you play on April 1st and everyone was a stick figure?
805136	806137	Yeah, I played on April 1st.
806157	809419	And I think the reason why it wasn't picking me up was because the mic was off.
810362	811183	Oh, how convenient!
811443	813445	That might have been the problem.
813525	813885	That's alright.
815547	816327	Alright, but it's on now.
816367	816768	We're good.
817108	818269	So anything else in your gaming week?
819230	823233	I've actually been participating in one of the X-Fire events for Grand Chase.
823914	829778	Apparently there's still an open beta and they want people to test it out, so they're doing in-game contests and such.
830599	832120	It's pretty good.
832160	833442	It's kind of like Smash Bros.
833482	838606	meets MapleStory, if you can even ponder that as possible.
839542	840963	Are you going to miss Live 365?
842385	844246	Yeah, I am going to miss Live 365.
844306	846368	What are you going to miss most about it?
847609	851873	Pretty much listening to 24-7 Station while playing WoW, but both of those are going to be gone.
853735	854696	You're ditching WoW too?
855356	857598	I stopped playing WoW back in October.
857878	859380	Oh, in favor of Guild Wars?
860301	861762	In favor of having money.
862262	863143	I ran out of money.
864941	865661	Ah, I gotcha.
866081	868502	WoW is one of the, you know, WoW is an expensive habit.
868622	873664	I'll probably join back up with the new expansion, but... There are ways to play for free.
874344	877485	There are ways to play for free, but they all suck.
877725	878546	Hacksaw servers.
879466	880586	I can't imagine they're fun at all.
880666	883387	Not that, but yeah, there are ways to pay for free.
883647	883867	Lays 2600.
883927	885208	What?
885428	887309	You could steal prepaid cards from the store.
887329	888129	Yeah, on the 2600.
888229	888749	On the 2600.
888949	892470	Oh, you... No, I hate April Fools.
892490	894091	You can move in a total of eight directions.
894815	898557	No, I meant in the latest magazine of the 2600.
898778	901319	Oh, 2600 magazine.
901539	902240	Oh, that 2600.
902560	903761	No, not the Atari 2600.
903841	907223	I thought you were talking about this stupid prank.
907303	911045	No, it's something that has to do with PayPal and crap, so whatever.
911325	913707	Interesting, but you have to do it every time you play it, so that's annoying.
915408	915668	All right.
916471	918572	I love, though, that you have the Horde symbol on your laptop.
918592	919533	That always makes me giddy.
919893	922615	I dug this up from some of my old stuff.
922655	925036	I never expected you had a laptop by the time I got this.
925096	929119	I hope they can see that on Justin TV, our little... All right, awesome.
929859	933701	All right, turn that mic off when we're not using it, because it makes a lot of clicky-clicky noises.
935638	936959	I don't know, what the hell?
936979	938521	My mic is on crack.
939261	942284	All right, well, I think that's going to do it for everybody's gaming week.
942364	945187	So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping.
946188	949991	Really, the only thing on deck is that there is the all games move pending.
950071	951372	That's going to start on April the 13th.
952313	953334	Love this, by the way.
953454	955797	Allgames.com is rolling out the red carpet for us.
955857	956378	We love them.
956418	957218	They're being great.
957479	966288	There's actually a little countdown clock on allgames.com that says it counts down the days and hours and minutes until OLR comes exclusively to their station.
966328	967049	It's going to be great.
967609	968851	So look for us there.
969431	971213	The plug will be pulled on Live 365 on the 12th.
972935	975317	We'll be taking the horse out to the barn and shooting it on Saturday.
1001284	1002265	They will become glue.
1002845	1005186	I know we make fun of it here.
1005726	1011188	Even some folks in chat were commenting earlier like, boy, they sure sound like they're going to miss the 24-7 feed.
1011668	1012128	We are.
1012729	1013549	We're going to miss it.
1013989	1016030	But at the same time, you know what?
1016290	1021572	It's kind of like one of the songs in the pre-show tonight, which had a very tongue-in-cheek theme tonight if you were listening to our little pre-show music.
1022072	1023173	A change will do you good.
1023453	1026074	So this is going to be something new for us.
1026134	1026734	It's going to be fun.
1027414	1028995	So that's that.
1030091	1043074	uh Zappy says will there be punch at the plug pulling punch and pat punch and pat but not alcoholic punch because I don't want to go back to the hospital with more pancreatitis please not that
1043757	1046499	So we're excited though about AllGames.com.
1047059	1057866	I still don't have the final word for you on Travis and DMN and all that, but if I had a Magic 8-Ball and I shook it, it would say Outlook looks good.
1058926	1063429	They're probably going to come over a little later than us, but we'll be there on Sunday the 13th.
1063749	1064270	Excited.
1065530	1065811	All right.
1066511	1067392	Enough housekeeping.
1067472	1070594	Let's get into gaming news that we can taunt and make fun of.
1070954	1071174	Loki.
1072125	1074026	Okay, so this is pretty awesome.
1074546	1077987	It's been rumored to be happening, but finally official now.
1078427	1080048	Sam and Max are coming to the Wii.
1080568	1084429	And, of course, it's being brought to us in the U.S.
1084669	1087711	by Dreamcatcher and, of course, the Adventure Company.
1088311	1091152	And in Europe, Joe Wood, of course, is publishing it there.
1094073	1096894	Not really any word on what exactly it will include.
1096954	1100235	Probably, you know, a lot of the episodes that we saw on the PC...
1101515	1104937	Don't know if maybe it's a compilation of Season 1, maybe something like Season 2.
1105637	1105917	Who knows?
1105957	1109999	Maybe it's even like... No, it's not going to have download content on the Wii.
1110079	1111840	But, I don't know.
1112420	1113200	It's pretty awesome, though.
1113580	1118242	So, glad to be able to play some Salmon Max since I don't use GameTap.
1119403	1120584	Or want to buy software.
1122544	1123905	And so that's going to be going to WiiWare?
1124545	1126486	I think that's actually going to be going to the Wii.
1126606	1127687	Oh, so it's not WiiWare.
1128087	1130608	Because I remember there was a rumor a while back that it was going to go to WiiWare.
1131723	1135825	I guess they could do it that way, but I don't think they would.
1136755	1139876	I think it'd just be, you know, maybe like the first season or something like that.
1140096	1151998	Yeah, that would be, I mean, if they package all the games together into like one, because the games themselves are only like three to four hours long, but if they package, you know, the entire first season, which was like eight episodes, I want to say?
1152078	1153038	I don't remember off the top of my head.
1153059	1155019	Maybe they could do the first and second season or something like that.
1155279	1155799	That would be good.
1155819	1163021	That would be a great deal because that would be, you know, you'd probably have like at least 15 episodes all together in one place.
1163061	1164561	I think that would be a pretty good deal.
1165222	1166363	I thought I had it turned on and pointed at me.
1166383	1168183	I'm probably going to play it, if I don't have to buy it.
1195950	1198852	BlackWolf says the first season is 6 episodes and the second season is 5 episodes.
1198872	1201294	Still, that's not a bad deal.
1221641	1222662	for 11 episodes.
1223643	1226086	That's going to be a 30-40 hour game.
1226106	1227247	That's the size of most games.
1228488	1229229	That'll be a good deal.
1231011	1232633	This is also going to be a good deal.
1232653	1234495	It would be a Super Smash Bros.
1234555	1235396	Brawl sequel.
1235456	1237158	It's also kind of a duh.
1237853	1247941	but at the same time, it would be interesting if a Brawl sequel came to the Wii because if you think about the previous Nintendo consoles, they only had one Smash Bros.
1247961	1248542	game apiece.
1249202	1251364	Nintendo 64 had that Smash Bros.
1251424	1258890	game, which I want to say was originally developed for the Super Nintendo but was brought over to the 64 when the console life switched up a little bit.
1259590	1260952	and then the GameCube had one.
1261532	1262893	Now the Wii has its one.
1262913	1264975	So it would be kind of weird if there was a second one on the Wii.
1265335	1267877	I don't think Nintendo plans to move away from the Wii anytime soon.
1267897	1269539	So it would be kind of interesting if we got a sequel.
1269879	1271180	What is the basis for this?
1271700	1281308	Well, Nintendo is, in one of their latest surveys, they do these surveys all the time on their website, they're asking a question about how likely would you be to buy a sequel to Super Smash Bros.
1281328	1282489	Brawl on a scale of 1 to 7?
1283970	1285271	One being I wouldn't buy it.
1285311	1287052	Seven being I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
1287452	1289994	I'm sure most people are saying seven, seven, seven.
1291035	1292295	I don't know many people who wouldn't say seven.
1292616	1293336	But it would be interesting.
1293676	1297178	What else can they do with Smash Bros.
1297238	1297619	Brawl?
1297879	1299100	A DS version?
1299960	1301561	Ah, there you go.
1302161	1303582	I bet that's it.
1303922	1305343	I bet that's exactly what they're going to do.
1305363	1306484	I bet it'll be a DS version.
1307344	1312307	You think if there was a DS version it would be just a dumbed down same version you kind of have on the Wii now?
1312328	1312868	Or do you think they'd...
1313519	1317802	Actually take the time to make something kind of new, maybe with some more DS-centric characters.
1318182	1321244	Well, keep in mind the DS is basically a handheld Nintendo 64.
1322105	1322665	I guess that's true.
1322925	1327388	So it'd probably be more like a throwback to the old Smash Bros.
1327768	1328008	True.
1328029	1333572	Of course they're going to whore this out, but I don't think it's going to come anytime soon.
1334092	1337935	I think it'll be at least maybe a year or two off if they're going to do something like that.
1338943	1342084	Jaded in chat says the PictoChat level where you can draw your own pics.
1342704	1343464	That might be kind of fun.
1343764	1347245	I bet the online seems to work a little better on the DS than it does on the Wii.
1347365	1348565	I bet online would work better.
1349786	1350726	Yeah, I guess.
1351406	1354087	The PictoChat level would be full of like cocks or something.
1355127	1355747	No doubt.
1355867	1359968	I'm not too confident with Nintendo and their online.
1360888	1364369	Ross Steel UT says I say we bring back the Virtual Boy with Smash Brothers.
1364969	1365309	No!
1365910	1366190	Yes.
1366490	1367770	I do not want a migraine.
1368426	1369889	Unless it's a playable character, that'd be cool.
1369909	1370990	I would not mind the migraine.
1371010	1373013	They should do a Super Nintendo version of Smash Bros.
1373033	1373634	That'd be cool.
1373895	1374275	Why?
1374816	1375417	It's gone.
1375497	1377060	The system's like dead and gone.
1377801	1379183	It's as dead as this station.
1380233	1382434	Bring it on to the DS.
1383115	1383895	Do all 2D.
1385216	1387277	I would believe that a Smash Brothers would come to DS.
1387297	1392280	Do a Smash Brothers game in the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 engine or something like that.
1392640	1393981	Arcade Smash Brothers.
1394621	1397262	Maybe that'll be the thing is they'll get third parties on board.
1397322	1397683	I don't know.
1397723	1398163	We'll see.
1398283	1402325	But regardless, I'm sure this survey is a no-brainer.
1402345	1403586	It depends on who they're surveying.
1403986	1407867	If they surveyed us, I'm sure we'd all be saying... Why do you waste money on a freaking survey like that?
1408087	1410988	Would a sequel sell for a really popular game?
1411288	1412128	I have no idea.
1412328	1414929	In other news, water is indeed wet.
1416509	1418690	Oh, and Jamie, just think of the Virtual Boy possibilities.
1418710	1420190	You can have the Teleroboxer stage.
1420890	1421170	No.
1422610	1423651	No, no, no.
1424231	1425491	The migraines are not worth it.
1426391	1431573	My Virtual Boy is sealed in foam in a plastic case, never to be opened again.
1431913	1433113	I want to play Virtual Boy.
1434281	1435682	I haven't played one in years.
1435742	1436002	I was like 12.
1436142	1436902	I'll bring it next week.
1436962	1438683	I played one at Blockbuster once.
1438703	1440523	We have one of the ones that Blockbuster was selling.
1440543	1442324	That's why we have the nice hard case and everything.
1442364	1444465	Can we hook up Virtual Boy to Justin.TV somehow?
1445545	1446386	Have the headache cam?
1446406	1446826	Why not?
1446886	1448887	It wouldn't be easy, but you could do it.
1449187	1449807	That might be fun.
1450667	1453748	Yes, I say we should have some type of competition with the Virtual Boy.
1453788	1456429	Like who can play the longest without having a seizure?
1456449	1456670	Throwing up?
1457190	1457750	Or throwing up?
1459284	1465070	and Cheeseburger in chat asks the definitive question, if Chuck Norris was in Brawl, what would be his final smash?
1467253	1468214	Overused joke.
1469975	1473199	Don't you know that that hand is actually Chuck Norris' hand?
1473659	1476082	Let's move on to the next story, please, before the Chuck Norris choice.
1476102	1477303	God, you guys are chinging to me.
1478384	1478885	That's okay.
1480566	1494273	Well, you know, there is actually, for anybody who has been waiting, and I know lots of people have for Mario Kart Wii, there's going to be a really awesome launch ready for it at midnight on the verge of the 26th to the 27th.
1494854	1496415	And guess where it's going to be?
1496735	1497395	My pants.
1498116	1498356	No.
1498616	1499316	Sam's Club!
1500617	1503298	Because no one knows how to get down like Sam's Club.
1504139	1506240	You can go to Sam's Club and they'll even have
1507561	1509403	15 Wii consoles on hand.
1509743	1513087	Will they have the ladies serving the samples of the little teeny weenies?
1513127	1514529	Dude, I would go just for that.
1514789	1521177	Would they forget to mention those 15 Wii consoles are being sold together in like a giant family pack of Wiis?
1521866	1528888	No, it's the Wii plus like 50 controllers and shitty games and a box of Froot Loops.
1529088	1532608	The Sam's Club actually realized that they're not a club and they're just a store.
1533008	1535889	And a two-gallon container of mayonnaise.
1536269	1539890	Because, you know, when you think video games, you think Sam's Club.
1541390	1544831	I bought the Vio at Sam's Club.
1546071	1546811	Here's my question.
1546871	1549072	It's all Sam's Clubs that are doing this or is it just a few?
1550371	1553993	It's saying... It's not actually saying a few.
1554053	1555313	It's just saying Sam's Club.
1555974	1559335	We should party down at Sam's Club.
1559355	1559956	Here's what I'm thinking.
1560276	1565078	If it is at every Sam's Club, we go to the Sam's Club out in freaking Roseville, okay?
1566035	1567795	because Roseville knows how to get down.
1568296	1570196	There's a lot of retired people out in Roseville.
1570676	1573197	What we'll do, we'll go there and we'll dress to the nine.
1573217	1575837	We'll dress in party hats and boas.
1576238	1582799	We have those hats, the little Mario hats that Ranma gave us some time ago.
1583159	1584400	We can wear our little hats.
1584420	1584900	It'll be fun.
1585460	1586020	Count me in.
1587480	1587980	You know what?
1589041	1590601	If they're doing it, we've got to do that.
1590801	1591281	You know what?
1591381	1591581	What?
1592282	1593922	I'll just have my copy the day it comes out.
1594878	1596559	You don't want to go party at Sam's Club?
1596579	1597940	Come home with Smash Brothers.
1597980	1599582	Dude, two gallons of mayonnaise, Jamie.
1600382	1600643	Rob.
1600863	1601123	What?
1601163	1601403	Rob.
1601783	1602024	Rob.
1602724	1602944	Rob.
1603325	1603565	What?
1605446	1607228	Loki, are you down with the Sam's Club party?
1607808	1608268	Fuck that.
1608429	1610690	I'll probably already have the game by the time the thing launches.
1610710	1612211	God, you people are no fun at all.
1612332	1613312	You don't go for the game.
1613372	1615114	I stood in line for a Wii.
1615394	1616975	How can I get excited about Sam's Club?
1616995	1617636	That's the point.
1617856	1618797	That's the point.
1618857	1622940	We took our lawn chairs and sat in line for our Wii.
1623387	1627912	We'll probably go there and be like, sorry, we're not doing the launch party, and be like, crap.
1629193	1632557	I will go, and you know why, because I have nothing better to do.
1632697	1634820	Will anyone go party at Sam's Club with me?
1638103	1644608	Well, if you don't want to go to Sam's Club to get Mario Kart, maybe you want to go to Japan to get Trauma Center 2.
1645309	1648151	That's right, the game is actually being slated for the DS.
1648331	1649132	It's coming back.
1649772	1653655	I guess the second opinion wasn't really a sequel then.
1654396	1666145	But Trauma Center 2, and I guess the sequel has Dr. Stiles and Nurse Angie tackling the effects of the unanswered mysteries of the guilt virus from the prequel.
1666926	1667206	Let's see.
1667861	1668622	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1688717	1701406	Trauma Center is one of those games where I swear it's one of those blink and you miss it kind of games, but it's a quote, an epic story that once aired on the station and on the nightly news here and locally.
1701967	1702727	It's so much fun.
1703908	1705189	Trauma Center is so much fun.
1706490	1707531	I like making them die.
1709841	1710341	I do too.
1711002	1713684	But I love the whole bringing him back to life.
1714304	1716526	The Wii controls in that game are really cool.
1717486	1721289	When you have to do the whole... Defibrillator.
1721529	1722410	Yeah, the defibrillator.
1723050	1725252	You have to push into the screen, onto the body.
1725292	1725972	It's really funny.
1726232	1726993	I like Trauma Center.
1728112	1731514	I would think you of all people, Loki, would, like, Trauma Center would be one of your favorites.
1731754	1738237	No, I liked it better when it was called Life and Death and came out, like, early, early, early PCs back when they had Windows 3.1.
1739117	1740878	Life or Death was hardcore.
1741038	1744980	And everybody, and the only, like, surgeries you'd do would be removing appendixes.
1745200	1747881	Oh my god, Life or Death was hardcore, though.
1747921	1751042	Like, if you screwed up in that game, you were killing patients left and right.
1751082	1751543	It was a very hard game.
1751563	1756625	That's why it's called Life and Death, and not Life and maybe... They should have called it Life but Mostly Death.
1757205	1758285	Because that's what that game was.
1758305	1760466	I was like, I'm going to scribble with the scalpel.
1760506	1763708	And you have to, like, read all this stuff before you go and do the surgeries.
1763768	1764708	But we didn't like to read.
1764728	1765748	We just wanted the scalpel.
1765848	1769150	In Trauma Center, you... Calteepa makes the best suggestion.
1769270	1769670	In chat?
1769750	1770230	What did he say?
1770310	1771751	Psychological Trauma Center.
1773852	1774832	That would be kind of rad.
1774852	1774932	Yeah.
1776893	1777213	All right.
1777233	1778453	You know what else is going to be... What?
1778473	1782235	I was going to say, oh, no, I have to repair your daddy left you or something.
1783468	1787633	Dr. Dennis Leary Shut the fuck up by Dr. Dennis Leary
1800686	1804767	Alright, look, let's move on to games I definitely want.
1805327	1807588	I do want Trauma Center 2, but I definitely, definitely want this.
1808368	1816029	I was actually surprised to hear that Final Fantasy 4 was not already confirmed for North America, but then again, this is Squeenix we're talking about.
1816409	1825892	But apparently this week, Final Fantasy 4 director Takashi Tokita did confirm that Final Fantasy 4 is being localized for North America.
1825992	1827732	That was in the latest issue of Nintendo Power.
1828753	1829953	Okay, wait, scratch that.
1830013	1837518	He didn't actually confirm the localization, but, I mean, there was English language screenshots in the article.
1839199	1841060	It's on the cover of the freaking magazine.
1841520	1843482	I think it's safe to say the game's coming out over here.
1843982	1845983	I think it's safe to say the game's coming out here.
1847084	1848745	I wouldn't know it or anything.
1848765	1851046	Would you know about when the game is coming out here by chance?
1851286	1853488	I would say it's coming out around here...
1856164	1856944	In time for my birthday?
1858205	1858545	No.
1858745	1859405	God damn it!
1859425	1862186	I can't get you what I was going to get you for your birthday.
1863246	1865767	Of course, I don't remember when your birthday is, unfortunately.
1865827	1866167	June 26th.
1866287	1866627	Don't forget it.
1866727	1866888	No.
1867248	1868328	It's not going to be out for my birthday?
1869108	1869248	No.
1869348	1870369	Will it be out in July?
1871169	1871429	Maybe.
1872749	1873690	Can we play Hot and Cold?
1873770	1874850	Is it July 15th?
1877191	1877551	Warm.
1877871	1879091	July 17th.
1879611	1880012	Warmer.
1880952	1881692	July 19th.
1882472	1883213	No, still warm.
1883913	1884233	July 18th.
1885458	1886138	What's a Tuesday?
1886538	1886878	Hold on.
1887719	1888519	Pulling up a calendar.

1905465	1905725	God.
1906065	1906845	July 27th.
1908266	1909606	Right now, it's at the end of July.
1912547	1914048	That's not the only game coming over here.
1914448	1914948	Oh, what else?
1915980	1918563	Uh, just another game Is it Chrono Trigger?
1918843	1920044	It's not Chrono Trigger Is it Chrono Trigger?
1920064	1926771	It's another DS game that's already in Japan right now That I'm showing you the title for Can I please say that on air?
1926791	1932696	Yeah, go ahead Dragon Quest V Yeah Wait, what?
1933096	1937741	Dragon Quest V That's apparently getting localized as well Excuse me for a second Should be fun

1940821	1941742	What the hell was that noise?
1941902	1943043	No, I just squeed into the mic.
1943223	1943443	Oh, okay.
1943483	1952068	Actually, there's another game coming out, too, the same day as Final Fantasy 4, but it's not for the DS.
1952168	1962975	It's actually a 360 RPG that's by Square Enix, although it's got the weirdest title ever, Infinite Undiscovery, so that should be coming around the same time.
1964135	1966717	But a lot of stuff could move, so...
1969019	1971080	Dragon Quest V, Final Fantasy IV in July
1997148	1998549	That's not a Square Enix game.
1998569	2000570	That was Nintendo themselves.
2000590	2001431	Yeah, that was Nintendo.
2002071	2003032	Bastard Nintendo.
2003252	2005634	That's what I call them now for not bringing that over here.
2005654	2006534	Bastard Nintendo.
2006854	2007395	Yes, they did.
2007455	2008155	It came out over there.
2008195	2008656	Why not here?
2009536	2010697	What's up with that, Nintendo?
2011657	2014579	Because the same people that own Nintendo own Life 365.
2014820	2021024	I'm going to take a detour for a minute to say hello to Rice Princess, who showed up 39 minutes late.
2021084	2021384	How are you?
2022080	2023982	I'm good and late, how about you?
2024142	2024743	I'm fine.
2025223	2026704	Awesome, I got you a present.
2026824	2028346	Okay, then I forgive you for being late.
2028606	2030608	Ooh, ooh, is that it for me?
2030648	2031829	This is it for you.
2031849	2032830	Oh, that looks so pretty.
2033170	2034111	It's kind of random.
2034471	2037634	It is, but they were on sale, and I'm like, oh, they have penguins, I'll be like it.
2037674	2040377	Floor mats for the car with penguins on them, they're so cute.
2040457	2041417	Wow, woohoo, yay.
2041498	2042378	I accept your gift.
2042579	2044500	Woohoo, in lieu of being late.
2044520	2046022	Your offering pleases Kitty.
2047082	2047922	It smells like new car.
2048522	2050343	Oh, that's weird.
2051983	2054183	And I have to say one other thing.
2054303	2057364	I got a Captain Crunch malt from Carl's Jr.
2057704	2060064	It is so fucking, I mean, flipping good.
2060565	2061205	No, we can cuss.
2061285	2062045	Fucking good.
2062825	2063605	It's free radio.
2064705	2065886	Oh my god, it's so yummy.
2066226	2067506	What are they going to do?
2067566	2068346	Cancel us?
2069006	2070806	Sorry, you cannot be on our station anymore.
2071106	2072467	But yeah, it's pretty good.
2072627	2074027	So yeah, okay.
2075016	2080175	I think we should try to set some sort of Guinness Book of World Records for the most time fuck has occurred in a podcast.
2081280	2081780	The Fuck Show
2107566	2112867	Yay, we'll lose all of our listeners in one shot.
2114628	2115828	We'll do it South Park style.
2115848	2120269	We'll have one of those little click counters in the corner of the Justin TV feed.
2120569	2121409	We'll do it, we'll do it.
2122250	2124570	Bobby, fuck show, why you're in?
2125590	2126751	Bobby's in chat right now.
2127651	2129912	Also say hello to Nathan, who's here.
2130792	2131232	Hello.
2131372	2131692	How are you?
2132817	2133597	I am fine.
2133677	2137139	Was the Captain Crunch milkshake flippin' fantastic?
2137559	2138039	It was.
2138160	2138540	It was?
2138880	2139420	Glad to hear it.
2139780	2140961	I can't drink it or it might kill me.
2140981	2142902	I still haven't had it yet.
2142942	2146083	Because I have to stay away from high-fat foods for a month.
2147284	2150385	But if they had Captain Crunch Jell-O, I'd be all over that shit.
2150625	2152546	I'll make you.
2152566	2154207	Yay!
2154287	2156128	Rob, you should have a smoothie.
2157308	2158509	Black Wolf says, why?
2159509	2160610	So, fuck show it is.
2161894	2163095	So what night is that?
2163135	2164935	It wouldn't be April 13th, it would be the 20th.
2166276	2168317	It would be the show the day after my birthday.
2168337	2170278	Well, fuck, I'm in.
2172219	2174900	I think that's a great idea because I'm going to be gone most of that week.
2175420	2177001	You're going to come for my birthday stuff, right?
2177021	2178161	I can't, I'm going to be out of town.
2179762	2180362	I'm sorry.
2180382	2181743	Alright, anyway.
2182867	2183667	We'll figure something out.
2183747	2186368	It'll be our late April... Oh my God, the show is on 420.
2186768	2187829	It has to be a fuck show.
2188089	2188369	Yes.
2188549	2189029	I know.
2189249	2189709	All right.
2190170	2191310	Enough about the fuck show.
2191610	2192450	Jamie, brownies?
2192570	2195832	Irene had enough time to go to the bathroom and back and we're still talking about the fuck show.
2196112	2196612	Wow.
2196652	2197772	It's going to be on 420.
2197992	2200573	Is it going to be like a really slow, mellow fuck show?
2200613	2201814	Like, hey, man.
2201854	2205115	No, it'll be... No, it'll be... Here's the deal.
2205135	2205915	I think this is the rule.
2206075	2207396	These are the rules for the fuck show.
2207476	2208876	Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2208976	2209256	What?
2209276	2210657	420 is marijuana day.
2210737	2211117	It's not...
2211617	2212398	and DarkSakura.com.
2233160	2235081	Who can work the word into the show?
2258789	2259990	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2280985	2288167	is Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo's Dungeon will be coming out in the summer over here and it's happy and makes me go squee and it'll be $39.99.
2288247	2292208	It's about time.
2293128	2295008	It's essentially the game that was on the DS.
2296069	2296489	Like already.
2296929	2298869	So we're getting a DS port on the Wii now.
2298909	2300450	Well, I think it may be remade a little bit.
2300650	2302590	I mean, Wii is like the porting system.
2302650	2305451	First it was all our PS2 games get ported with Waggle.
2305511	2306451	Now we're getting DS games.
2306471	2307371	Well, I guess that's nothing new.
2307391	2308191	We had Cookin' Mama.
2309152	2310392	It's cute and it goes quee.
2311932	2314854	Are you going to buy the game just because the Chocobo goes, Yeah.
2316236	2316636	I am.
2316876	2320699	Loki, will you hack the game so the Chocobo goes, Fuck.
2322341	2323702	No, I don't know how to do that.
2325003	2325663	Not yet.
2325923	2326364	Not yet.
2328032	2335157	Anyways, so it's been recently discovered that Konami has trademarked a new name for a Castlevania game.
2336138	2343603	The title of the game, which is assumed to be for the DS, is Castlevania Order of... Man, I can't even pronounce the rest.
2343643	2345904	It looks like Ecclesia.
2346725	2347946	Ecclesia, yeah, that's right.
2348946	2349747	Order of Ecclesia.
2350827	2352208	Is that a musical term?
2352228	2354470	I thought all the Castlevania games had to have music in them.
2355731	2357012	Oh yeah, Portrait of Runa.
2357112	2359874	Has to be something artsy and this one's more like logic.
2360615	2361355	Ecclesia.
2361535	2362136	Ecclesia.
2363057	2363377	I don't know.
2363557	2365038	Not making up words.
2366079	2378368	I suspect that this game will have someone in the Belmont family fighting a vampire, probably Dracula, and there will be whips of some sort and possibly magic and hearts and stuff.
2378688	2379489	Okay, hold on.
2380209	2382231	I'm using my mind reading techniques right now.
2382731	2383572	Something tells me
2384568	2389929	This game will have holy water as a weapon.
2390810	2391530	And crosses.
2391710	2392630	Yes, and crosses.
2393250	2393810	Maybe daggers.
2393990	2395251	And an axe.
2395411	2398232	One of the characters will have a whip.
2398992	2400252	Stop giving your nonsense.
2400272	2404253	You heard it here first, I'm telling you.
2404973	2408814	When are they going to have a Castlevania game where you fight the Belmonts?
2409555	2410955	They have had one, Symphony of the Nights.
2411943	2412863	You fight the Belmonts?
2412903	2413584	You fight Richter?
2413764	2414264	That's right.
2414944	2415704	Wasn't that at the second castle?
2415724	2418325	Sort of, but he's not like the main boss.
2418605	2421786	He is unless you go do the thing where you have to go fight Shaft.
2421806	2422846	I mean, he is the main boss.
2423247	2425647	Totally, if you're not wearing the sunglasses.
2425927	2426448	Exactly.
2426788	2428268	That's the only time he actually is.
2428588	2429809	Then there's Arya of Sorrow.
2429829	2430789	I didn't play that one.
2430989	2432389	He is a boss, though.
2433210	2434290	Richter is awesome.
2434650	2437371	I like his Ryu look and Rondo blood.
2440066	2442948	All of them!
2443729	2447871	I don't know, because you always fight Dracula or something like that.
2447931	2448991	It's like, come on.
2449072	2450052	Or Castlevania.
2450172	2453314	Dracula fucks up the Belmont family reunion.
2453954	2454395	DS.
2454675	2456756	Aw yeah, Dracula's gonna fuck you up.
2456776	2459958	I haven't really been into the Castlevania series on the DS.
2460018	2460378	I don't know why.
2460398	2460798	I don't know why.
2467224	2469906	I don't like the 3D Castlevanias.
2470307	2471007	I mean, they're okay.
2471047	2471467	Like what, 64?
2472728	2474890	No, like Lament of Innocence.
2475130	2475830	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2475870	2476591	Curse of Darkness.
2476611	2477752	They're okay.
2477892	2479733	I like my 2D Castlevania.
2479873	2480974	Yeah, I understand that.
2481174	2481354	Yeah.
2482236	2491859	Well, despite whatever it is they're putting out on the DS, it's working because Nintendo is supreme when it comes to Japanese hardware and software sales.
2491899	2495080	And this is per the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.
2495100	2499642	The Nintendo DS and the Wii have sold 6.3 and 3.7 million units.
2499702	2501983	That's 6.3 million for the DS, 3.7 for the Wii.
2502543	2507185	And Wii Fit is selling like crazy in Japan, 1.76 million units.
2507625	2510846	Nintendo has the top five spots in software.
2511326	2512666	Super Smash Bros.
2512706	2513826	Brawl, and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.
2540245	2541506	Those are the top five games.
2542006	2544367	Don't hate on Pokemon.
2544387	2544927	Don't hate.
2545367	2546828	I hate as much as I want.
2546908	2549709	Pokemon Mystery Dungeon doesn't really count because it's two games.
2550149	2552090	Oh, that's true.
2552110	2553330	It's a little bit of cheating, isn't it?
2553570	2554391	Yeah.
2554711	2555191	Cheaters.
2555631	2556372	Poke-cheaters.
2556452	2557072	Cheater-mons.
2558012	2558793	Cheater-mons.
2559593	2559753	Cheater.
2559833	2560193	Cheater.
2561334	2563975	Alright, so yeah, Nintendo's making a lot of money in Japan.
2564075	2564475	Go, Fig.
2565836	2566776	What else is new?
2568056	2568377	I don't know.
2568397	2569417	You tell me what else is new.
2570077	2573299	This has to do with old stuff for something new.
2574700	2590930	There has been a fact sheet released for details on Mario Kart Wii, and for anyone who's wanting to play with their classic controller or the GameCube controller, it has been said that certain moves will not be able to be used with those controllers.
2591271	2592051	Like snaking?
2592351	2593032	I say hooray.
2593932	2596014	It doesn't say specifically.
2596034	2597555	They took snaking out of the game altogether.
2597575	2598936	I think we talked about that last week.
2599236	2599556	That's good.
2600694	2612726	But it's basically saying that by using the Wiimote and Nunchuck together you're supposed to have full playability in the game but those people are going to have an advantage over the people using the older controller schemes.
2613627	2617671	I have a feeling that it's not so bad as people are making it out to be.
2617731	2618051	I think
2618959	2626361	It'll probably be because I think you can do different little tricks and stuff, not just one trick when you're doing jumps to get boosts and stuff.
2626901	2638923	So you probably will be able to do one trick on the GameCube or Classic Controller or something like that, and then the people at the Wii can use the controller to do different tricks using the motion controls.
2639283	2643324	Because, I mean, with that controller turned sideways or something, I mean, there's definitely not...
2644261	2651924	That many buttons to use, and so a lot of it's motion control, so I don't see why they couldn't translate that stuff into button presses.
2653087	2654208	It's just sheer laziness.
2654308	2657609	Do you think the game's going to control as well with a classic controller anyway?
2657649	2663612	Because it seems to me like this game is going to be calibrated for that motion control that an analog stick can't quite replicate.
2663952	2664413	You know what I mean?
2664513	2666534	I still think it'll be fine with the classic controller.
2666734	2669475	I played Brawl with the classic controller, and I plan on playing this game.
2669495	2669855	But it's different.
2669875	2671496	Brawl doesn't rely on motion so much.
2671516	2681341	Yeah, but I mean, I plan on playing this game with the classic controller, and if that doesn't work, there's always the remote nunchuck, which you can just use the analog stick on that, and then...
2681761	2711330	Some of the motion controls with the remote Because that's not gimped on it But I don't think it's going to be a big deal And the fact that they would do that to try to force people to buy their stupid You know, possibly use their stupid steering wheel controller or something like that I think it's kind of lame Besides, that steering wheel is going to give them problems We'll see I'm looking forward to the game nevertheless It's going to control a lot differently, that's for sure But as long as it's better than Double Dash
2714339	2715400	Well, this is kind of neat.
2715640	2719322	It's a homemade game for the Nintendo system.
2720463	2722185	It's a game called Glider.
2722605	2725027	It's made by a company called RetroZone.
2725067	2728209	I guess it's a remake, I think, of a game that came out on the Mac or something like that.
2728789	2734093	But the interesting thing about it is the game will have download content.
2735574	2737176	But it's not as easy as it sounds.
2737416	2740278	It's not just like something you can pop into...
2743413	2748834	You actually have to reflash the cart, and it requires a $70 accessory to do it.
2748894	2749815	Wow, what a bargain.
2750135	2756236	But you can get new levels and stuff, and that same accessory will let you dump ROMs and crap like that.
2756356	2765878	But it's just still kind of neat to see them actually, first off, making new games, and secondly, allowing you to add new levels to it.
2766573	2771395	Aren't there still new games for the Nintendo being made in countries like Taiwan and stuff?
2771415	2775116	Because didn't we see a version of one of the Tekken games?
2775196	2777217	Like get an NES port or something recently?
2777237	2778198	I've seen some weird stuff.
2778278	2780518	Oh, and those RPGs I've been seeing.
2780599	2783720	Like Final Fantasy VII ported to the NES and that stuff.
2784400	2788902	And then there's also one that I saw, which is Contra III ported to the NES.
2789122	2790162	That Titanic game?
2790642	2791943	That looked like tons of fun.
2792503	2793624	Yeah, so I don't know.
2793924	2794064	It's...
2795413	2796053	It's interesting.
2796133	2798594	Hell, they're still making like Vectrex games and stuff like that.
2800235	2803136	There's always a fan of something somewhere.
2804377	2806398	Would you play a game based off Titanic on the NES?
2806838	2806998	No.
2809259	2810620	Even though Leonardo DiCaprio dies?
2811240	2811380	No.
2811620	2818623	Well, if you are interested in playing this game Glider, you can find it on the website RetroUSB.com
2819193	2821595	It's, I believe, like $50, no, $42.
2822115	2825718	Currently, it's on back order, but coming out early April.
2825738	2827739	The only bad thing about it is it's black and white.
2828440	2831402	I really do think it came out originally on a Mac.
2832262	2834104	The game, I guess, is from 1989.
2835825	2841589	But what's cool, though, is it comes with a cardboard box, pretty manual, just like the old NES games.
2842049	2845111	And, of course, there's the black dust sleeve and that kind of thing.
2845131	2846092	And it's region-free.
2846434	2846694	Airball
2871089	2871409	Sudoku, yay.
2871429	2871649	What?
2871669	2872510	I said Sudoku, yay.
2872530	2872650	Sudoku?
2872670	2872830	Yes.
2872870	2872951	Okay.
2872971	2873671	Shut up.
2873731	2873991	Let's...
2893854	2893974	Turok
2923317	2923977	is coming out.
2924738	2927539	Yay!
2927579	2928999	Did you pre-order your copy?
2929159	2932121	I did, yes, and then I named my kid after Turok.
2932181	2932721	It was great.
2935042	2935542	Poor kid.
2935602	2936943	I wonder if he gets teased.
2936983	2938563	What grade would he be in now?
2939204	2940404	Still in elementary school?
2940924	2941164	What?
2941324	2942625	The kid that was named Turok.
2942645	2944526	You don't remember that contest?
2944586	2947607	They got paid a million dollars to name their kid Turok?
2948507	2951228	You host a video game show and you do not know this?
2951268	2953089	I don't remember old news.
2953109	2954529	It ain't that old.
2954549	2957070	He's like, I don't know, 10 years old or something.
2957191	2957631	All right.
2959011	2967695	By the way, we apologize that our audio is so fucked up in studio tonight, but something about that microphone that they're using in the back is really sensitive.
2968635	2969375	Oh, I'm sorry.
2969535	2970996	I'll talk like right here.
2971016	2971396	There you go.
2971436	2972237	That's a perfect level.
2972437	2973017	Wonderful.
2973157	2973757	Live radio.
2974017	2974778	Back to Japan.
2976878	2978119	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
2978780	2984963	Mario Kart Wii makes its way out on April the 10th, as well as Karas Wii.
2985443	2987724	That's not Kid Akaris, that's K-A-R-O-U-S.
2988565	2992067	And then Neo Geo Stick 2 comes out as well.
2992087	2993127	I'm not sure if that's a joystick.
2993167	2994028	Oh, it's just a joystick.
2995928	2997789	I thought it was actually a game for a minute.
2997829	2999490	Like a stick figure game where you kind of think like Stick Fighter.
2999510	3001131	I don't know, Stick Fighter, exactly.
3001811	3005133	The PlayStation 2 Battle of Sunrise comes out.
3005649	3007030	from Sunrise Interactive.
3007050	3009430	So I wonder if it's like the employees fight each other.
3009671	3010351	That would be cool.
3010371	3011731	That would be actually kind of a rad game.
3012211	3015293	No, this looks like... What kind of game does this look like?
3015853	3020615	It looks kind of like one of those robot fighting games that you see quite a bit of in Japan.
3020915	3023176	It looks like it's got a tech element to it as well.
3023856	3024936	That must be the gist of it.
3024976	3026217	Probably some type of tech game.
3029118	3032399	Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS...
3034052	3040396	Oshiri, Kajiri, Mushi, no, Rhythm Lesson DS comes out from Sega.
3040476	3045418	Wait, did you say the first word was... Oshiri, Kajiri, Mushi.
3046539	3049340	Oshiri, I'm probably just mispronouncing it because I horribly do that.
3049620	3050681	But it's a music game.
3050901	3057204	It's like learn how to dance like these scary looking critters with flowers coming out of their heads on the cover of the game.
3059666	3060386	Maybe they're saying like,
3060956	3063496	Move Your Butt, Rhythm Dancing, whatever it's called.
3063516	3063656	Maybe.
3063897	3067037	So if you live in Japan and you've got no rhythm, hope is on the way.
3067937	3076019	On the PSP, the only game coming out on the 10th, Nanpure and Okake Puzzle 10,000 Mon.
3078619	3078999	Okay.
3079479	3081900	I think it's just a Sudoku game.
3081940	3082800	I think that's what they call it.
3082840	3083700	Yay, Sudoku.
3083860	3084540	Oh, shut up.
3084700	3085400	You shut up.
3086140	3088401	How many Sudoku games do they have in the Simple series?
3088421	3089541	It's just nuts.
3091235	3093716	It's silly because you can just play it for free online.
3093736	3094997	I don't know why you'd buy a game.
3096798	3099399	I'm going to remember that, though, that Oshiri means butt.
3101360	3103961	Hey, JustinTV, want me to show my Oshiri?
3104942	3106843	No, please don't proposition that.
3107403	3110825	I would have to see it.
3111165	3112125	Oh my god, Glenn.
3112606	3113446	When did he get here?
3113526	3114627	Nobody knows who Glenn is.
3114647	3115107	Never mind.
3115874	3117834	Nobody knows that joke outside of well.
3118054	3118375	I know.
3118675	3120475	I kind of regret saying that.
3120535	3128237	According to Alpha Canonogram, it's a butt-biting bug game.
3129877	3130597	Sounds like fun.
3133738	3134038	All right.
3135138	3140359	And no, I'm not going to show my butt on the Justin TV cam because some sick asshole would highlight it.
3140859	3142240	So I'm not going to do that.
3142940	3143640	Let's move on.
3144605	3146727	Let's move on with other release dates, please.
3147768	3148549	Okay.
3149089	3150450	How about some for the UK?
3150891	3151331	How about it?
3152392	3153513	A bunch of stuff on the 11th.
3153593	3170408	We have Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, Soldier of Fortune Payback, the History Channel Battle for the Pacific on a bunch of systems, Assassin's Creed, Altair's Chronicles, Assassin's Creed Director's Cut Edition, Draglade, Mario Kart Wii,
3171448	3199606	Sam and Max Episode 205, What's New, Beelzebub I think that's a funny name, although I still won't play the game UEFA Euro 2008, Victorious Boxers Challenge So you can punch people in the face Sounds like fun That does sound like fun I want to punch people in the face Well, Drew's right there Hi, come here so I can punch you Is that it?
3200427	3200787	Yes
3201127	3202368	Yay, crap!
3202388	3202748	My favorite.
3202868	3203228	Wow.
3203248	3203468	Awesome.
3231525	3232986	What the hell is wrong with us?
3233166	3234987	Like, make some games that aren't stupid.
3235007	3236668	Dude, they should make a game called Furries.
3237308	3238189	No, they shouldn't.
3238449	3240750	You know you would at least rent it, just to see what it's about.
3240810	3241971	No, I would not waste my money.
3242471	3243492	It's called Second Life.
3243512	3245473	It totally is.
3245853	3252476	The orange box is going to be broken up this week, so we have Half-Life 2, the episode pack, which I believe is episode 1 and 2.
3254177	3257999	Then we've also got Portal coming out on PC.
3258680	3260721	And then finally, of course, Team Fortress 2.
3262367	3265650	and on the Wii, Minicopter Adventure Flight.
3265910	3269314	It's a game where you can play around with a RC helicopter.
3270395	3273418	There's also Summer Sports Paradise Island.
3273919	3278003	It's a Wii game with lawn darts, which are illegal, I guess, in the United States.
3279196	3281177	Lawn Darts are illegal here?
3281898	3283539	Dude, we had those growing up.
3283919	3284719	Yeah, they're illegal now.
3284879	3287341	Ooh, I'm reporting you to Hot Dog.
3288141	3291163	You don't know Hot Dog.
3291443	3292043	Let's see here.
3292243	3295845	Also on the Wii and PlayStation 2, Baroque is coming out this week.
3297166	3302129	On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart, which is that all-girl anime fighting game from Atlus.
3302629	3303730	Hot.
3304590	3306451	Also, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 2.
3308271	3310312	Coming out on PlayStation 2 for $14.99.
3310732	3330964	On PC, we have Overclocked, A History of Violence, Assassin's Creed, and finally, oh, let's see here, Sam & Max Episode 205, What's New Beelzebub, will be coming out on GameTap and PC.
3331805	3333346	And I guess Civil War Mysteries as well.
3336314	3336574	Hey!
3337695	3337875	Sorry.
3337895	3339396	We make fun on this show.
3339536	3340437	And I think that's it.
3340617	3345860	And there's, as we mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, Ikaruga's rumor will be coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade.
3346360	3347381	Hopefully that's not broken.
3348542	3351043	And hopefully it isn't a shitty port, because that'll make me cry.
3351964	3353505	Where is my radiant silver gun?
3354946	3357027	Uh, questions, or comments from chatroom.
3357267	3360169	Qualtipo says, the furry game would be rated D for drama.
3360610	3362671	Because I guess there's a lot of drama in the furry scene.
3362691	3363812	I would know.
3363872	3364592	You're kidding.
3365413	3365493	Uh...
3367370	3371573	Catamaris Forever, Arcana Heart, Eleven Girl Fighters, Girl on Girl Action ManBearPig, CosplayersHateFurries
3395538	3402084	I didn't know there was this rivalry between cosplayers and furries.
3402104	3402905	It's like Pirates and Ninjas.
3402945	3404967	Dude, that should be a fighting game.
3405187	3407369	I guess one kind of drama hates the other kind of drama.
3407629	3409511	Cosplayers versus furries.
3409591	3410271	I would buy that.
3410412	3412614	It's like Pirates versus Ninja.
3413174	3413875	Exactly.
3414836	3415076	Oh yeah?
3415096	3415336	Cowboys.
3415396	3416057	Cowboys.
3417731	3421412	and SSGL100 Matt says, no, no, no, everyone hates furries.
3422032	3422952	Aw, poor furries.
3423793	3425053	Not poor furries.
3425413	3427434	They're completely cognizant of what they're doing.
3428634	3432495	Dude, I would love... Okay, so what are the ideas for games we've had?
3432535	3433495	We've had laser cats.
3434215	3436616	We've had... What else do we have on a previous show?
3436956	3438136	We need to write these things down.
3438216	3438557	You do.
3438577	3439817	Or put them on the wiki or something.
3440017	3440477	Something.
3440557	3440897	Damn it.
3441057	3443898	But now we have... Wasn't there something that had to do with paper?
3445619	3450403	It was one of those games, yeah, because there was a game for DS coming out that you could just play on paper.
3450803	3453025	It was like Pictionary or something on the DS.
3453085	3454546	I remember talking about that in a previous show.
3455147	3456608	It was something you could play with a pen and paper.
3458029	3459590	And now I want to add this to the list.
3459630	3460851	Cosplayers vs. Furries.
3461892	3462993	An epic fighting battle.
3463533	3465015	Rob's voice, the game.
3465075	3466756	No, no, scratch that from the list.
3466776	3467336	That wouldn't sell.
3472899	3474420	LOL, that was the name of the game.
3474440	3478522	There was a game on the DS called LOL, and it was something you could just play with a fucking piece of paper and a pen.
3478642	3485226	Oh, that's right, because the whole premise of that game was to get people to laugh or something like that, and they would vote on which drawing is the funniest or something like that.
3485246	3486106	Yes, that's it, that's it.
3486987	3488267	Yes, it's called pen and paper.
3488828	3490569	Can somebody please add that to the wiki?
3490609	3497512	Can our wiki gods like AJ Mix or DarkTetsui or somebody, can our wiki gods add a page of our great ideas?
3497792	3500654	And be sure to put on the bottom, patent pending.
3501530	3503672	GameStop.com is down GameStop.com is down GameStop.com is down
3529614	3529874	Yes, please.
3529894	3529995	Yes.
3546689	3550451	So if that's it for the US releases... I think it is at least.
3550591	3553473	How did release dates turn into cosplayers versus furries?
3553573	3554093	You did it.
3554273	3555174	That was your fault, Rob.
3555234	3556074	It's all my fault.
3556254	3556775	You know it.
3557615	3558776	It was an April Fool's joke.
3559536	3562318	You know, it's actually not the first anymore.
3563238	3568061	Well, I'm trying to transition into talking about some of the April Fool's Day pranks from around the web.
3568381	3569642	And you know I've got to start with this.
3569702	3574024	This week we had so many April Fool's Day pranks because everyone gets in on it, except for Orange Lounge Radio this year.
3574044	3576846	We didn't do an April Fool's Day prank because we had depressing news.
3577046	3579167	So the holiday was kind of ruined for us.
3579588	3583270	However, the IGN trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie.
3584122	3584943	What the fuck?
3585363	3588306	Somebody spent like thousands of dollars on that.
3588327	3589328	Did you see that trailer?
3589368	3590369	I did see that trailer.
3590489	3592871	Didn't it make you like want to like come?
3593332	3594133	Not at all.
3594213	3595814	It was actually pretty well done.
3595974	3596935	It was okay.
3597016	3600119	Some of it was hokey, but it looked like a sci-fi movie to me.
3601581	3602362	What do you expect?
3602422	3603903	I mean, it's not much on the trailer.
3603923	3607766	I mean, if they put a decent budget behind it and maybe had a good writer or something.
3608027	3612030	I didn't believe for a minute it was real because it didn't have a single star in it.
3612110	3616074	And a movie like Zelda would at least have a star in it somewhere.
3616134	3621198	Like Ian McKellen playing the old man that says, it's tough out there to go alone.
3621278	3622439	Here, take this or something.
3622459	3623500	But he'd say it in his voice.
3623560	3624801	It's dangerous to go alone.
3624841	3625141	Thank you.
3625201	3625702	That's what it is.
3626562	3627383	It's dangerous.
3627563	3629265	Sean Connery, it's dangerous to go along.
3629305	3630126	I can't do impressions.
3630386	3631608	No, you can't, so you should stop.
3631628	3633610	But there would be at least one famous person.
3633650	3636192	That's why this thing couldn't be real and the CGI was a little hokey.
3636473	3638355	But I thought it was pretty amazing.
3639051	3639992	The work that they did do.
3640012	3642053	For an April Fool's joke, it was awesome.
3642233	3646395	Yeah, they put a lot of effort into it for an April Fool's joke, but I wouldn't.
3646415	3648417	Now, did you see the Making Of trailer?
3648677	3651739	Because they did that shit in July of last year.
3652119	3654780	They did a Making Of trailer of a trailer.
3654880	3662485	No, well, they had like a Making Of little snippet thing that was released the day after that shows you like how they did it.
3663192	3664253	No, I didn't check.
3664293	3665634	Like, oh, it's April 2nd.
3665694	3669397	Time to check and see if there's something following up.
3669497	3670097	Is this better?
3670378	3670538	Yeah.
3670938	3672379	The date was July.
3672459	3673420	They did that in July.
3673440	3675702	That's the only thing I cared about in there was, like, when did they do it?
3675722	3677863	Because I wanted to hear them say, like, why they did it.
3678984	3681146	But it was July when they were putting it all together.
3681166	3682487	I was just kind of surprised at that.
3683487	3684688	Well, good job.
3685029	3688231	But Loki, I noticed there was no Tingle in the movie, so there's still hope.
3689692	3693275	No, I don't think that there was Tingle in the first game either.
3693395	3694155	That's all right.
3694175	3694836	They can work it in.
3695036	3695636	No, they can't.
3696037	3697598	Well, they can, but I'm not playing him.
3701040	3701841	Yes, the legend of me.
3704366	3733555	The Legend of Me The Legend of Me Other April Fool's jokes from around the web Microsoft actually put together their own little thing like they were announcing all these devices that were going to come out such as the retro Xbox 360 that had a wood finish on it and the retro controller and I thought the hilarious part I like how Microsoft can kind of make fun of themselves because the retro controller had like 100 buttons on it it looked like a typewriter it was kind of funny and then they announced like a virtual headset and my favorite was Xbox Live the board game
3734366	3735106	That was pretty good.
3735166	3736406	Oh, God.
3736426	3737107	What else did we have?
3737447	3751290	Kotaku did Cake Kaku for a day or something like that, not Bukkake, but Cake Kaku or something like that for a whole day where they were nothing but gaming cakes, which was actually kind of funny because they do cover a lot of gaming cakes on that blog, or at least they did in the past year.
3753470	3754090	What else was there?
3754150	3756991	Somebody announced My Little Pony for Xbox Live Arcade.
3758371	3759031	That's awesome.
3760692	3761312	That's awesome.
3761532	3762172	Oh, don't forget WoW.
3763595	3764456	StarCraft 2 Torrin Marines
3792937	3793677	They were beefy.
3794177	3796398	I still like the Guild Wars thing.
3796498	3797638	I thought that was cool.
3797758	3801059	And Lord of the Rings on mine had giant chickens that you had to fight.
3801079	3802940	But nobody cares because it's Lord of the Rings on mine.
3802960	3808101	And actually, speaking of Guild Wars, the Guild Wars wiki and the WoW wiki switched places for a day.
3808161	3811142	So you tried to go to WoW wiki and it was giving you Guild War quests.
3811542	3812282	That's awesome.
3812302	3812702	That's great.
3812922	3813942	And then vice versa.
3814742	3815123	Brilliant.
3815343	3820624	And there was also the Konami Ubisoft one where they had Altair in Metal Gear Solid 4.
3821977	3851129	and they did like an actual video from in-game and stuff with all that going on and what other ones oh Dark Tetsuya says Shang Long in Street Fighter 4 yeah just gonna say that that was funny I don't know there's oh Bungie did one where they're showing like the Xbox Halo 3 stats you know how like show a little light or whatever where people are playing Halo 3 and apparently it made you know their little cartoon Halo head thing on there
3851502	3854924	Creativity from around the web Did anyone fall for a prank?
3854944	3856244	Chatters, did any of you fall for a prank?
3879813	3881596	I got my boss to fall for a prank.
3881616	3882757	My work review was on April 1st.
3892375	3893996	And so I was thinking that there was going to be all this stuff.
3894036	3900819	But I went in and I was like, well, before we start the meeting, I have to tell you something really, really important.
3901299	3902560	And this is bad news for you.
3902900	3904020	It's really good news for me.
3904420	3910923	But I've been offered a job at the Beau Ravage in Biloxi, Mississippi as their massage therapist for some sort of reopening thing.
3911364	3912884	So I'm going to be moving in three weeks.
3913565	3915265	And I did it completely deadpan.
3915405	3918927	And she just got quiet and looked at me and said, I'm happy for you.
3919733	3920934	And I was like, well, thank you.
3920954	3922275	And also, I just completely fooled you.
3924337	3925758	This is at my annual review.
3925958	3926258	Nice.
3926699	3932563	But she said that they all got her by... She calls in to check on us every morning and that they said that nobody else showed up.
3933764	3939649	The only April Fool's prank I played is I went to our guild forum for WoW.
3940090	3945954	I went to the guild forum and I posted a post that says why I quit the guild last night to go back to Final Fantasy XI.
3947255	3949317	And then you open it up and it says, yeah, right, April Fool's.
3950185	3951165	That's clever, Rob.
3951225	3952046	I know, it was great.
3952946	3955227	The worst part is, some of us actually believe you.
3955687	3956348	I know, I know.
3956408	3958709	What about all the Rickrolling stuff that was going on?
3958969	3961670	Oh, God, Rickrolling is so old.
3961910	3967452	However, there was a clever one that was linked to me of the Muppets.
3968413	3969013	Oh, that one.
3969473	3970293	And that was cool.
3971034	3978457	The best Rickroll was not Beaker, but it was not GameFAQs, which was evil.
3979648	3987295	But it was actually Chris Perillo of Locker Gnome from the Screensavers announcing his last video podcast.
3988476	3991218	Because apparently he had a fight with his woman.
3991779	3992259	His woman.
3993240	3994681	It's always the woman.
3994741	3999385	I'm sorry, I just... He looks away, freeze frame, never gonna give you up, starts playing.
3999525	4000526	I'm like, oh god.
4000787	4005190	I think my favorite April Fool's joke other than the Zelda thing had to have been...
4006107	4011029	and I know it was a little late for April Fools but the release of Mr. Driller and they're online.
4011650	4013190	It's so funny because it doesn't work.
4014771	4019893	I fooled all those people because it's Mr. Driller online and the online portion doesn't work.
4020934	4024815	You remember Mo who was here a few weeks ago who did a cover of Still Alive?
4024955	4025396	Remember that?
4025916	4031378	She actually has a cover of Never Gonna Give You Up on YouTube and that's how we found her actually.
4031398	4034900	That's how Jake found her to begin with and they call it chick-rolling.
4036474	4037595	If you want to link that YouTube.
4038135	4038735	So there it is.
4039776	4040496	I'm not making that up.
4040556	4043218	There's a cover of her doing Never Gonna Give You Up.
4043258	4043758	It's quite good.
4044238	4047200	So April Fool's, I guess it's about fooling people, obviously.
4047520	4053843	And yeah, the Zelda thing was pretty good, but I kind of like things that make me laugh on April Fool's Day.
4054064	4058386	And definitely the Molten Core console thing just made me crack up.
4058820	4061381	Blizzard does good jobs every year with April Fools.
4061541	4062721	They do good jobs.
4062781	4065122	Let's move on with news because we want to wrap this segment up.
4065242	4068343	Well, I have our downloadable content stuff.
4068944	4069464	Yay, stuff.
4069984	4074786	Xbox Live Arcade, Mr. Driller Online, 800 Microsoft points.
4074946	4076506	April Fools, game doesn't work.
4076826	4079367	Xbox Live Marketplace, Army of Two, Football Manager 2008.
4079487	4081288	This is UK, sorry.
4081928	4082148	Sorry.
4082408	4083169	Some of it's over here.
4085015	4093381	Game Content, Call of Duty 4, Variety Map Pack, Two Worlds, Curse of Souls, Pinball FX, Rocky and Bullwinkle Table Guess what?
4093481	4094122	I owned one!
4094322	4094943	For reals!
4095343	4095883	So ha ha.
4097284	4098725	That's how I got my World Cup Soccer.
4100487	4105330	A whole bunch of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol stuff.
4105971	4106391	Who cares?
4107592	4108453	I gotta get that game.
4108473	4108853	Yes.
4110373	4138239	themes, MrDrillerOnline, FIFA Street 3, Brazil, England, France, Italy, Germany, Mexico, Spain, USA, Australia, pictures, Major League Gaming, GotFrag, Major League Gaming, Game Battles, Turok Creatures, Turok Whiskey Company, Wolf Pack, Variety, MrDrillerOnline, War Shit, Call of Duty 4, Nick Busby, Ink Blots, Number 2, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Elite Pack, PSN, nothing.
4139235	4141436	Virtual Console in Europe, Yoshi's Cookie.
4142297	4147039	In the U.S., we got Cruisin', and we got Wonder Boy, which we've talked about.
4147439	4161907	For the Metabolite thing, there's Imprinium Romanum, Buku Dominoes, and Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Sins of the Solar Empire as a PC demo is out.
4162307	4162787	So there you go.
4163325	4170433	Here's the hilarious thing about the Mr. Driller Online theme, is that when you download it on Xbox 360, what the theme is, is just a bunch of red X's.
4176340	4177541	Anyhow, let's move on.
4180505	4181586	Let's see, I was going to say also...
4182482	4189085	PlayStation Network is not going to have much for the next few weeks anyway since they're revamping their store and in the meantime not putting anything up there.
4189405	4195228	So if you want your free still live like you get in Xbox 360 you're going to have to wait until the 17th.
4195508	4195968	So that sucks.
4196649	4207053	Another game though that you're going to have to wait even longer for is The Force Unleashed which was originally going to be a July game but now it's been pushed all the way to September 16th where it's hopefully going to stay.
4208094	4210775	This week though they had some videos showing off
4211391	4217696	The different versions of the game, which I guess each game is getting their own exclusive things.
4217917	4225983	For example, the PlayStation 2 and PSP titles will be getting some exclusive storylines and stuff like that in the game.
4226264	4232609	In the 360 and PS3 versions, you of course get kick-ass graphics and physics.
4233550	4238654	In the Wii version, they actually have a battle mode where you can fight different people
4239577	4244218	and also like, you know, Wiimote, Lightsaber Combat and stuff like that.
4244718	4254060	And I believe also the PSP version has some like legacy storyline modes that you can play through five different storylines through the six episodes of the movie.
4254600	4255381	So that's kind of neat.
4256301	4258281	And it looks like a pretty awesome game.
4258601	4262002	And like I said, September 16th is when we can see that in the U.S.
4266323	4266683	All right.
4269540	4271142	Are you excited about The Force Unleashed?
4271362	4271823	I actually am.
4271883	4273124	I'm thinking about picking that up for the 360.
4273345	4275767	Star Wars games are usually pretty good.
4276969	4278070	I like Lego Star Wars.
4278170	4278771	So go figure.
4278791	4282716	We have people trying to connect to Live 365 right now and it's not letting them in.
4282736	4283536	Those are bastards.
4283557	4285098	I'm not going to miss this place at all.
4285158	4287161	The more I think about it, we should have done this a year ago.
4287181	4287321	Yeah.
4288251	4288571	All right.
4289592	4290492	Rooster Teeth.
4290793	4298637	You might not know that name, but you definitely know Red vs. Blue, something that they've put together for years and years, but they obviously... They also did The Stranger Hood.
4298877	4299037	Right.
4299057	4301759	Well, now they're going to do something called Reconstruction.
4302139	4307843	They put out a trailer, a little teaser video that's available on YouTube if you search for Reconstruction, Rooster Teeth.
4308403	4312806	You'll find it... What I find interesting about it, though, it's a little bit more serious.
4312926	4314967	At least the trailer had a more serious tone, so...
4315407	4318490	I guess they're getting away from the funny stuff and maybe doing something a little more serious.
4318730	4319771	I don't know about that.
4320011	4322193	I mean, every series that they've done has been funny.
4322933	4323634	I guess that's true.
4323674	4327637	I mean, maybe, I don't know, but it would be interesting if they took the different direction.
4327937	4328558	It would be interesting.
4328958	4333802	Maybe it'll be a dramedy, like Ally McBeal was drama but funny, well, to some.
4335303	4336144	Yeah, that's debatable.
4336284	4337485	I never really found it funny.
4339206	4340267	Neither did anybody else.
4341198	4342038	I never watched it.
4342439	4342899	Oh, snap.
4343179	4345460	She was too skeleton-like.
4346060	4347261	Yeah, that's every time I look at it.
4347301	4348121	All right.
4348621	4349502	No more TV critic.
4349542	4350262	Back to gaming news.
4350722	4354604	Remember when we were talking about the contest for Puzzle Quest, the add-on getting a name?
4354824	4355104	No.
4356125	4356545	Just kidding.
4356585	4356965	Yes, I do.
4357586	4357866	Rob.
4358086	4358306	What?
4361928	4363288	Is that the name of the new expansion?
4363448	4364229	Yes, that's the name.
4364269	4364929	Try to spell it.
4366192	4369734	Anyway, they got 500 plus suggestions.
4370775	4371255	That's it?
4371295	4372455	That's actually kind of sad.
4372536	4372696	Only 500?
4372876	4373976	I know, right?
4374557	4377238	And in the end they got Revenge of the Plague Lord.
4378338	4381920	I was hoping they would pick Puzzle Quest 1.5 to search for more money.
4383801	4384581	That's Spaceballs 2.
4385742	4386142	Ah, yes.
4387503	4389384	That's actually kind of a dumb title.
4389444	4389884	I don't know.
4390424	4392245	It doesn't make me go OMG 1.
4392645	4393586	The Runner's Up.
4394386	4398007	with Sorceress of Malbec and the Scourge of Antharg.
4399288	4400428	Those are much cooler names.
4400548	4403469	I think I knew an ogre in a D&D game named Antharg.
4403729	4408391	It's like they threw the alphabet into Will It Blend and they got those names.
4410072	4410612	Say that again.
4411052	4412653	The Sorceress of Elbec?
4412673	4413013	What was that?
4413073	4413533	Malbec.
4413593	4415974	Malbec and the Scourge of Antharg.
4416134	4416734	Antharg.
4417114	4418515	Did you actually watch any of those yet?
4418979	4419999	Will It Blend is pretty good.
4420039	4422740	Yes, I watched the one where they blended a Guitar Hero controller.
4422760	4424161	I liked the one where they blended the iPhone.
4424301	4426161	It was pretty awesome.
4426201	4428342	I liked the one where they exposed a hobo in that.
4431723	4432603	April Fool's.
4432703	4433144	Just kidding.
4438065	4443267	Well, there's a game that is on Xbox Live Arcade that everybody loves.
4444262	4446804	and, well, they're going to be loving the sequel, too.
4447224	4452548	It's Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, and it is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.
4452568	4455790	Well, at least that's where we would assume it's going.
4455990	4462374	And this comes to us from the Australian Classifications Board, the OFLC, which has just raided the game.
4462474	4469018	So, you know, kind of like the MPA, not the MPA, but the ESRB here.
4470831	4471452	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4490993	4492654	What do you think they're going to change in this game, though?
4492734	4494075	I kind of like the Wii version.
4494095	4495156	The Wii version was good.
4495196	4497898	I mean, that would be a pretty kick-ass download game.
4497998	4501701	But, I mean, then again, it's the game that's on the Wii, so I don't think they could do the same thing.
4502081	4507265	But, like, I didn't know there was a lot else they could do to Geometry Wars, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.
4507345	4509287	Add some new animes, maybe, or something like that.
4509367	4510107	Different weapons.
4510928	4511228	I guess.
4511668	4514931	Maybe they'll have, like, co-op or competitive mode or something.
4515411	4517733	That would be a big change, because they didn't have that in the first one.
4519134	4520215	So, we'll see.
4520999	4522620	Well, we're going to play this song.
4527341	4537464	Long-time listeners of our show recognize that song as Happy Wedding, which is going to introduce a new segment in the show this week called Nerds Got Married.
4539105	4543026	Whenever there's a wedding of note that we want to highlight on the show, we're going to say Nerds Got Married.
4543626	4548688	So this week in Nerds Got Married, a listener of Orange Lounge Radio actually got married.
4549562	4551003	The Viva Pinata guy!
4551103	4552283	Remember the Viva Pinata guy?
4552303	4553504	He's actually a listener of the program.
4553544	4554884	He commented on our MySpace.
4556205	4559526	I think he was mad because we were poking fun at the story, even though that's what we do here.
4559646	4562767	But the Viva Pinata guy got married.
4565388	4572151	You might remember in Viva Pinata, he did the diamond sending thing and did a little note in the game.
4572751	4575832	And they had the wedding, and they did it on a cruise ship.
4577132	4581195	and they actually had little Viva Pinata creatures on their wedding cake.
4582075	4584997	So congratulations to David and Jen.
4585037	4595203	If you want to see more about the wedding, it's all on David's YouTube channel, which is available at, what's his username?
4595623	4596443	Gearscast.
4597044	4600066	It's G-E-A-R-S-C-A-S-T.
4600546	4602527	He must also be a big Gears Award player.
4603548	4604108	So there you have it.
4604148	4604968	Nerds got married.
4605128	4605849	Congratulations.
4607816	4608256	DarkSakura.com
4635461	4639482	It also hurts my heart that this is classic now.
4640922	4643043	So, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the kids this week?
4643083	4645564	It's your classic game of the week, something they must check out.
4645864	4647364	I picked pure awesomeness.
4648204	4649745	I picked Crazy Taxi.
4649765	4651785	100 gas.
4653386	4653706	Awesome.
4654306	4658787	Yeah, this is the best, like, one of the best games ever.
4659508	4662588	Hey, hey, hey, it's time to make some crazy money.
4662688	4663309	Are you ready?
4663529	4664669	Here we go!
4667373	4668954	That's not the same song I remember.
4669134	4672916	No, well, it had Bad Religion and Off the Line.
4672936	4673376	Gotcha.
4673897	4688144	But yeah, it's basically, not only is it a clever type of beat-the-clock sort of driving game, you can do different kinds of stunts in there to increase your fare.
4688164	4690805	You have to play for a better rating.
4690865	4694827	I remember playing in the arcade until I got an S-class license and I was so freaking happy.
4696630	4710196	But the game also is a clever advertising technique for Pizza Hut, Fila, Tower Records, which actually I guess it wasn't so clever for Tower Records, Levi's Store, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
4710816	4714218	They all had massive product placement in that game.
4714718	4716359	But you had four different drivers.
4716539	4725463	You had your balanced driver, you had your fast one, you've got your best control, and then you had your heavy cab that can
4725885	4726306	DarkSakura
4743260	4748882	The songs from Bad Religion and Offspring from Bad Religion have been released at 10 and 2010, then the Master of the Gearing.
4749202	4752323	And Offspring knows all I want to enjoy the world and lay down the line.
4752363	4752903	That's what it was.
4752943	4754484	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
4754544	4755184	I remember that song.
4755204	4758885	That song, like, I can't hear that song on the radio and not think of this game.
4760906	4762006	Oh, let me forward a little bit.
4764207	4764427	Thanks.
4764447	4767508	Take me to Pizza Hut.
4767528	4768489	Take me to Pizza Hut.
4771083	4771904	I love this game.
4772024	4773764	I actually think this is one of the better driving games.
4774245	4777426	I'm not so fond of it on the Dreamcast as I am in the arcades.
4777486	4780107	Like, for me, that's the home for this game, was an arcade game.
4780387	4784729	Although I will give props to the Dreamcast version, because it had the missions, and it had the extra stuff in it.
4785109	4786150	The missions were hard, though.
4786170	4789211	The missions were actually pretty cool, so I'm just going to bring that up.
4790371	4795834	You actually... It trains you to do different stuff in the game, is what the missions are there for.
4796274	4798295	So showing you how to do, like, uh...
4799662	4808618	I actually thought the later ones that had some of the interesting ones like the super long jump and everything that was kind of cool.
4808979	4810782	This is one of my favorite games ever.
4812347	4813888	Irene, were you a fan of Crazy Taxi?
4814409	4815009	I never played it.
4815389	4815609	Really?
4815930	4816330	Really.
4816730	4818171	It's a really fun game, actually.
4818251	4818772	I should try it.
4818812	4821013	For a driving game, it's a lot, it's just different.
4821053	4824015	It's not just, you know, like NASCAR, vroom, vroom, vroom around in a circle.
4824095	4824436	It's pretty fun.
4824456	4826217	You race the clock and get crazy money.
4826757	4827778	You guys get crazy money.
4827798	4829239	Take people to Pizza Hut.
4829259	4830680	How could you not like that?
4831000	4832001	Yeah, I'll have to try it sometime.
4832181	4833922	It's actually available on GameTap, too.
4833982	4836884	I know I whore that a lot, but hey, they got free games on there.
4836924	4837905	Well, I guess free, free, but...
4840035	4847622	Is it like on the later ones, how they had it where you could play, where you could have multiple people in your car, too, and do different deliveries to different places?
4848323	4852567	Rostio UT says, funny that Pizza Hut isn't Pizza Hut anymore, they're Pasta Hut now.
4852627	4854649	Did they have to change that in later games or something, maybe?
4856090	4856731	Oh, in the game?
4856871	4857331	I don't know.
4857531	4857832	Maybe.
4858032	4859233	Wasn't that an April Fool's joke?
4859513	4859914	Yeah.
4860694	4861235	Oh, perhaps.
4861375	4863056	No, they're Wing Street now, or whatever.
4867075	4869976	Tiger Claw mentions in the game you can't run over people, sadly.
4870076	4871597	Any attempt, they always run out of the way.
4871877	4875479	I'm talking about running into cars.
4876780	4877800	You can run into cars.
4879721	4880742	I love Crazy Taxi.
4881142	4881842	I know, me too.
4881862	4883863	I want to make some crazy money, Rob.
4884924	4885884	Well, I got a dollar.
4887425	4888225	I owe you a dollar.
4888245	4889106	You should just keep it.
4890862	4898006	Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of our podcast, but there's plenty more to come for this, our last week on Live 365.
4898066	4903129	Coming up in Part B, we're going to play a game that we started here on Live 365.
4903229	4907792	Actually, this game dates all the way back to a show I did on college radio.
4907832	4909873	So this game has survived for 10 years.
4910293	4911654	We're going to play it one last time.
4911694	4915836	Well, not last time, but one more time tonight here on Live 365, and then we'll bring it over to all games in a few weeks.
4915976	4917477	We're going to play Listless tonight.
4918303	4923427	and the topic for tonight's list list so folks can start thinking about what they want to do here in studio.
4924227	4928330	Things that Live365 could do to get us to stay.
4929751	4931352	This is the topic of tonight's list list.
4931652	4934514	Things that Live365 could do to get us to stay.
4935235	4940098	So you guys think about that and we will cover that in part B of our podcast.
4940138	4941819	But until then, a break.
4942480	4942880	See you then.
4943624	4948615	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.
4949076	4953406	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
