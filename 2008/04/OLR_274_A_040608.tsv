0	18360	The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, and not necessarily those of Douglas
18360	36720	O'Brien, the author of Orange Lounge Radio.
36720	41320	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture
41320	43160	and the gamer lifestyle.
43160	45080	My name is Rob Roberts.
45080	49120	Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
49120	50120	Hi.
50120	51120	How are you doing?
51120	52120	Hi.
52120	53120	Okay.
53120	54120	I'm doing okay.
54120	55120	Good.
55120	58840	Say hello, as well, to Tech Master Loki.
58840	59840	Hello.
59840	60840	How are you doing?
60840	61840	I'm doing okay.
61840	62840	All right.
62840	64680	I'm glad to hear you're okay and not crappy.
64680	65680	I'm not crappy.
65680	66680	All right.
66680	67680	Good.
67680	68680	We were going to have some guests tonight.
68680	73320	Actually, I invited... Well, it was very last minute.
73320	75880	I was out most of the week, as some of you have heard.
75880	81320	I'll get into that later, but I invited guests from the past, because tonight is the last
81320	82640	show on Live 365.
82640	89040	I invited a bunch of guests from the past to come tonight to say goodbye to Live 365,
89040	90040	and no one's here.
90040	91040	I don't want to say goodbye.
91040	93040	You know what I want to say?
93040	94040	What?
94040	95040	Fuck you.
95040	98400	Well, I sent the official cancellation notice today, so there's no turning back now.
98400	100400	It's a done deal.
100400	101400	They're bastards.
101400	102400	Oh, I know.
102400	105640	They shouldn't have upped the rates, but oh well.
105640	106640	It's done.
106640	109800	If you don't know the latest yet, go back and listen to last week's show.
109800	115760	Again, starting next week, April the 13th, we are now going to be on allgames.com.
115760	120000	For those of you guys that listen to the podcast, which is most of you listen to this in podcast
120000	124560	form only, not the live stream, you're really not going to have to change a damn thing,
124560	126640	because the podcast feed will stay the same.
126640	129840	The shows are going to go to the same place.
129840	133840	Not a lot's going to change for you, except some aesthetic things.
133840	137680	We might try some different sound qualities and so on, but nothing that's really going
137680	139920	to shake things up too much.
139920	144400	But for the live folks, this is a big deal, because we have some folks that have been
144400	148220	here every freaking night practically for the past five and a half years.
148220	149220	That's a lot.
149220	154240	So it's a big change for some people, like Dark Tetsuya I know is here, episode one.
154240	155520	He's still here tonight.
155520	157560	Drew is supposed to be in studio tonight.
157560	158560	I don't know why he's not here yet.
158560	160280	He might be just running late.
160280	164960	He was also here for episode one, so we have a lot of people that maybe weren't here for
164960	168040	episode one, but joined us somewhere along the way.
168040	170320	So it's a big change for our live listeners.
170320	175240	Anyhow, let's go ahead and start off tonight's show, as we always do with How Was Your Gaming
175240	176240	Week?
176240	177240	Dark Sakura, we'll start off with you.
177240	178240	How was your gaming week?
178240	187000	It was Ragnarokan, as usual, and we have started working on cleaning up the pinball machines,
187000	190880	because Dan's having a pinball party next Sunday.
190880	192440	That sounds like fun, a pinball party, huh?
192440	195640	We're having a bunch of people over at the house, it's like, everybody wants to meet
195640	196640	you.
196640	197640	It's like, well, too bad.
197640	200440	What exactly happens at a pinball party?
200440	201440	Pizza and pinball.
201440	202440	Oh, okay.
202440	203440	Sounds pretty good.
203440	208760	And then people talk about their collections and stuff, it's just like, look how pretty
208760	210120	my pinball tables are.
210120	212360	Are people actually going to bring pinball tables over?
212360	213360	No.
213360	214360	Okay, I was going to say, they're not very portable.
214360	216360	No, but we have plenty, I think.
216360	217360	Are you going to do...
217360	218360	Well, here's my question.
218360	221960	Are you going to have not just the pinball machines, but maybe, like, pinball FX on the
221960	226800	TV, on Xbox Live?
226800	227800	I don't know.
227800	228800	You know what you can do on Xbox Live?
228800	229800	Shit.
229800	230800	You can do shit.
230800	235480	I was going to suggest that he hook up the Nintendo and put in Pinbot.
235480	237480	Ah, there you go.
237480	240360	And maybe we can hook up the TurboGrafx and put in Devil's Crush.
240360	241760	Oh, okay, good idea.
241760	250080	And he picked up one of those classic collections, too, like the whatever super awesome of pinball.
250080	255000	And to Shadow Siler, I play on Essence RO, but you won't ever find me.
255000	256760	I haven't made the guild yet.
256760	258760	How about Sonic Spinball?
258760	260480	I could do that.
260480	261480	I've got Sonic Spinball.
261480	264600	Because that was a very strange pinball game.
264600	268560	It reminded me of that part of Casino Night where I'd get stuck and get pissed off.
268560	271240	So that's what that game always reminded me of.
271240	272360	Gotcha.
272360	273640	We always welcome our chatters.
273640	275380	They're here with us every week.
275380	279560	This last Live 365 show is no exception, and we'll still be in the same chat room next
279560	280560	week.
280560	282000	That's an important note.
282000	283000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
283000	287120	At this time, we're not going to be switching to the all-games chat.
287120	289160	I don't know if we will in the future.
289160	291960	We're doing baby steps right now, so we're still going to have the Orange Launch chat
291960	292960	next week.
292960	294400	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
294400	299120	Comment from Shadow Siler says, DarkSakura, which server do you Ragnarok on?
299120	302880	That's what I answered when you said that I play on the Essence server.
302880	303880	I'm sorry.
303880	304880	I was on crack.
304880	307560	Canty says, How many pinball machines does DarkSakura have?
307560	308560	Okay.
308560	311280	Now, I have to think about which ones are actually mine, because we're holding some
311280	312280	for some people.
312280	317360	So the ones that we're holding is a Brite of Pinbot, an Indiana Jones that Dan is shopping
317360	318660	out.
318660	325640	We are holding a Back to the Future and a Black Knight, not Black Knight 2000.
325640	327640	I wish I had that one.
327640	332760	And then for ours, we have Star Trek The Next Generation.
332760	343720	We have No Fear, Twilight Zone, Simpsons Pinball Party, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and
343720	345880	my machine, World Cup Soccer 94.
345880	348840	Did I say Twilight Zone?
348840	351160	Yeah, we have Twilight Zone.
351160	352160	All right.
352160	356680	It seems like things have changed a lot since the last time even I was over there.
356680	357680	That's crazy.
357680	358680	All right.
358680	362520	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
362520	364520	As he sits down, ready to go.
364520	368120	My gaming week was pretty brief.
368120	375680	I played pretty much just Saints Row this entire week, I think, yes.
375680	379840	But it's finished now, so that's good.
379840	383720	And well, I'm still not 100% in the game because I have to do all the damn activities and some
383720	388520	of them are fucking impossible, but as far as the story goes, I'm done.
388520	393840	I already knew what the ending was anyway, so I'm glad I'm done so I can start Saints
393840	399160	Row 2 when that comes out in Grand Theft Auto IV and all that fun stuff.
399160	400160	That's it.
400160	401160	Wow.
401160	402160	That's a relatively short week for you.
402160	403760	Well, I played a lot of Saints Row.
403760	406360	I mean, we played the death matches during lunch.
406360	411080	I had a funny moment where I was driving on the sky in Saints Row because the game is
411080	412920	a little glitchy sometimes.
412920	414840	So that was fun.
414840	419280	And well, that's about it.
419280	423400	I didn't play a lot this week, but I did have enough time to beat a game.
423400	424400	That's right.
424400	427960	I beat a game from start to finish, which I haven't done in quite a long time.
427960	430360	And the game that I beat was You Have to Burn the Rope.
430360	434360	I don't know if you've seen this game yet, but it's got hilarious music.
434360	438760	It's stupid but funny, you know, one of those stupid funny things.
438760	440400	So obviously, don't take that too seriously.
440400	443520	The game takes like a minute and a half to beat.
443520	446400	And then, let's see, besides that, really not a lot.
446400	450600	I played Mr. Driller for like 10 minutes.
450600	452680	The new one on Xbox Live Arcade.
452680	453680	I'm sorry.
453680	456920	Well, yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.
456920	461120	I wonder what version they ported because I was surprised to see, and maybe it's just
461120	465680	because of the mechanics of the game or whatever, but I was surprised to see that the playing
465680	468320	field was only a really small portion of the screen.
468320	471080	I don't know if maybe that's to support the multiplayer or what have you.
471080	472440	Did you get to play online?
472440	473560	Which is probably a lot more fun.
473560	475840	No, I'm completely basing my judgment off the demo.
475840	478800	Oh, good, because if you played online, you'd be like, this game is shit.
478800	479800	Why?
479800	480800	Did you play it online?
480800	481800	Well, the online is all broken.
481800	482800	It's completely broken.
482800	487240	If you're hosting the game, you have no problem, but other people that are playing with you,
487240	488680	they can't drill down.
488680	491480	They'll start drilling down and they'll pop back up, and they'll start drilling down and
491480	492480	they'll pop back up.
492480	493480	Nice.
493480	496360	There's so much lag in it, it actually goes in reverse sometimes.
496360	499520	So yeah, I didn't play a lot of games this week, but I have a valid excuse, so I'll talk
499520	502920	about this real quick because a lot of people have been asking.
502920	507680	The reason why Part B went up on Saturday this week, which is extremely late for Part
507680	508680	B to go up.
508680	511400	We tried to get it up on Wednesday, like Thursday at the absolute latest if I had something
511400	512400	going on.
512400	516840	I was in the hospital for three days this week, and it was mentioned on orangeontraday.com,
516840	521760	you probably saw that, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.
521760	526480	I don't know how much I've mentioned it on the live show, but I've been having abdominal
526480	532480	pains on and off for the past three weeks, and finally it kind of reached a head on Wednesday.
532480	537400	I got woken up by some horrendous chest pain, and it was like, like, alien is going to pop
537400	539480	out of my chest, you know, bad.
539480	541320	So I finally just went to the ER.
541320	545400	I was kind of getting the runaround from my doctors, you know, like, they had diagnosed
545400	549160	me with pancreatitis, but didn't seem to be doing much about it, and finally I had to
549160	550160	go to the hospital.
550160	556640	So, yeah, that's where I spent about three days, pretty much, because what I had was
556640	561660	acute pancreatitis, basically my pancreas is fucked up, and it was producing too much
561660	565080	of a certain chemical, and it makes it really painful to eat fatty foods.
565080	569480	It most commonly happens, funny enough, it most commonly happens in lushes.
569480	573720	You know, people who drink a lot, alcoholics, like 80% of the cases are alcoholics.
573720	579400	Now, while I enjoy the occasional beverage, and I talk about it here on this program,
579400	584320	I would say drinking one, maybe two drinks a week does not make me an alcoholic, so alcohol
584320	586840	didn't cause it, and being fat didn't cause it.
586840	591240	I thought that maybe the fact that I ate out a lot and all that stuff might have caused
591240	597240	me to go to the hospital, but that wasn't it either.
597240	605240	My triglycerides were too low for that to be the case, so that was not the case either.
605240	608960	So they don't know what caused it, and now the thing is, is that I don't want to be into
608960	614200	too much of a downer syndrome or whatever, but folks have been asking.
614200	617880	The weird thing is, is that they did like a CAT scan, they did an MRI and all this shit
617880	619320	on me in the hospital.
619320	625680	I have some type of cyst on my pancreas, apparently, and thank God it's not cancer, says the doctor,
625680	631100	because then I would have what Patrick Swayze has, and that's really not good, and I'm not
631100	633400	trying to make light of that situation.
633400	635160	It's never good to be compared to Patrick Swayze.
635160	638520	Well, no, I'm serious, because he only has so long left to live.
638520	642000	It's the same thing Michael Landon of Highway to Heaven died of years ago, is pancreatic
642000	643000	cancer.
643000	646160	Thank God it's not cancer, but still, it's kind of scary.
646160	649880	So I don't mean to bring the show down, but that's basically where I was all week, and
649880	652360	since folks have been asking, that's what's up.
652360	656160	I find the toughest part of all of it is, A, the fact that I didn't do anything to cause
656160	657160	it.
657160	660520	It's one of those cases where really they don't know what caused it.
660520	664160	They think it could be an allergy to the medication I took, although if that's the case, I will
664160	668320	be one of the first documented cases of that kind of allergy, like ever, to this antibiotic
668320	669320	I took.
669320	670560	They also say that stress is a cause.
670560	673080	I'm not that stressed out, though.
673080	675080	Things are pretty good in my life right now, all things considered.
675080	679600	Sure, the life 365 thing sucks, but it's not going to cause me to go into the hospital
679600	680600	bad.
680600	681600	You know what I mean?
681600	682600	So I don't know.
682600	683600	I don't know.
683600	687280	It's really bad.
687280	691600	My only thing is I'm always afraid it's going to come back, but I've lost a crazy amount
691600	692600	of weight.
692600	697400	In the past month, I've lost 21 pounds, to put it, and you probably notice if you're
697400	700000	on just a TV because my pants won't stay on.
700000	701000	It's kind of sexy.
701000	702000	No, I'm just kidding.
702000	703000	All right.
703000	705560	I'll stop being such a downer now.
705560	708320	That was my week and why I didn't have much of a gaming week.
708320	714640	I noticed that strolling in a little late to the program is Drew is finally here.
714640	715640	Yes, that's on.
715640	717680	It's very sensitive, though, so be careful with it.
717680	719680	He'll pick you up from a long way away.
719680	721680	Just leave it there then.
721680	722680	Maybe you can.
722680	725440	Just kind of tilt it towards you and talk into it.
725440	726440	Hey, guys.
726440	728440	Are you listening clearly, I hope?
728440	729440	Yeah.
729440	730440	All right.
730440	731440	Introduce yourself.
731440	732440	It's DrewNami, of course.
732440	733440	It's DrewNami.
733440	734440	Of course.
734440	735440	And you were here episode one, weren't you?
735440	737080	I was not here episode one.
737080	738080	I was listening to episode one.
738080	741160	But you were listening to episode one, and now you're here for the last show on Life
741160	742160	is Five.
742160	743160	Well, not the last, last show.
743160	744160	Yeah.
744160	747840	I remember episode one, I was listening from New York.
747840	748840	So how was your gaming week?
748840	751240	We're going to get that mic a little closer to you while you talk about your gaming week.
751240	752240	Yeah.
752240	753240	You move a little closer.
753240	755360	I don't know what happened to Irene, so we'll wait for her later.
755360	756680	Well, how was your gaming week?
756680	759000	Well, I've been on my WoW methadone.
759000	763280	I've been on Guild Wars for a while, got the new expansion for it.
763280	764640	It's pretty good.
764640	770360	I got in with a guild from Game Facts, a small little guild.
770360	774120	It's not WoW, but it's good enough.
774120	777600	What's so exciting about the most recent Guild Wars expansion?
777600	782840	They give you a whole bunch of new NPC heroes to put in your party if you're antisocial
782840	783840	and shit.
783840	789120	And you get a whole bunch of new missions, new skills, basically new everything, and
789120	790960	it all leads into Guild Wars 2.
790960	792520	Yeah, they're still saying you're really quiet.
792520	793600	Go ahead and just pick up the mic.
793600	796520	Just hold it away from your mouth.
796520	797520	Live radio, folks.
797520	798520	Come on, come on.
798520	799520	It happens.
799520	800520	All right.
800520	801520	Did you play on April 1st?
801520	804520	Yeah, did you play on April 1st, and everyone was a stick figure?
804520	808600	Yeah, I played on April 1st, and I think the reason why it wasn't picking me up was because
808600	809600	the mic was off.
809600	811640	Oh, how convenient.
811640	813640	That might have been the problem.
813640	814640	That's all right.
814640	816440	All right, but it's on now.
816440	817440	We're good.
817440	818840	So anything else you're giving me?
818840	823680	I've actually been participating in one of the X-Fire events for Grand Chase.
823680	826800	Apparently, there's still an open beta, and they want people to test it out, so they're
826800	830680	doing in-game contests and such.
830680	832240	It's pretty good.
832240	839600	It's kind of like Smash Brothers meets MapleStory, if you can even ponder that as possible.
839600	841240	Are you going to miss Live 365?
841240	845400	Yeah, I am going to miss Live 365, fourth and all.
845400	847720	What are you going to miss most about it?
847720	851520	Pretty much listening to 24-7 Station while playing WoW, but both of those are going to
851520	853800	be gone.
853800	855040	You're ditching WoW, too?
855040	857520	I stopped playing WoW back in October.
857520	860280	Oh, in favor of Guild Wars, or just...
860280	862040	In favor of having money.
862040	863320	Oh, and having a life.
863320	864320	I ran out of money.
864320	866200	Ah, I gotcha.
866200	868600	WoW is an expensive habit.
868600	872440	I'll probably join back up with a new expansion, but...
872440	873800	There are ways to play for free.
873800	877800	There are ways to play for free, but they all suck.
877800	878800	Hacksource servers.
878800	880760	No, I can't imagine they're fun at all.
880760	883160	Not that, but yeah, there are ways to pay for free.
883160	884720	Oh, latest 2600.
884720	885720	What?
885720	888000	You could steal prepaid cards from the store.
888000	889000	On the 2600.
889000	890000	Oh, you...
890000	891000	No.
891000	892000	I hate April Fools.
892000	893000	No, no, no.
893000	894400	You can move in a total of eight directions.
894400	898760	No, I meant in the latest magazine of the 2600.
898760	899760	Oh, 2600 magazine.
899760	900760	Oh, that 2600.
900760	901760	No, not the Atari 2600.
901760	902760	No, no, no, no.
902760	903760	Let's not even talk about 2600.
903760	904760	No.
904760	905760	No.
905760	911360	It's something that has to do with PayPal and crap, so whatever.
911360	912360	Interesting.
912360	915400	But you have to do it every time you play it, so that's annoying.
915400	916400	Alright.
916400	918680	I love, though, that you have the Horde symbol on your laptop.
918680	919720	That always makes me giddy.
919720	922640	I dug this up from some of my old stuff.
922640	924000	I never expected you to get a laptop.
924000	927480	I hope they can see that on Justin.TV, our little...
927480	928480	I'll skip.
928480	929480	Alright, awesome.
929480	930480	Alright.
930480	934120	Turn that mic off when we're not using it, because it makes a lot of clicky, clicky noises,
934120	935120	so...
935120	936400	I don't know.
936400	937400	What the hell?
937400	938800	That mic is on crack.
938800	943200	Alright, well, I think that's going to do it for everybody's gaming week, so let's talk
943200	946320	a little bit about housekeeping.
946320	950240	Really the only thing on deck is that there is the All Games move pending.
950240	952500	That's going to start on April the 13th.
952500	953500	Love this, by the way.
953500	955880	AllGames.com is rolling out the red carpet for us.
955880	956880	We love them.
956880	957880	They're being great.
957880	962000	There's actually a little countdown clock on AllGames.com that says, like, it counts
962000	966360	down the days and hours and minutes until OLR comes exclusively to their station.
966360	967640	It's going to be great.
967640	969440	So look for us there.
969440	976400	The plug will be pulled on live 365 on the 12th, probably around 8 or 9 o'clock at night.
976400	980800	I'm hoping that we're here to do it live, or at least I'll be here to sign on live,
980800	984720	say some final, final farewells, and then officially pull the plug for Dead Air.
984720	987880	So the plug will ceremonially be pulled on Saturday night.
987880	988880	That'll be fun.
988880	989880	Sorry, I...
989880	990880	What?
990880	991880	No.
991880	992880	It's almost like it's a person.
992880	993880	Yes, it's almost like it's a person.
993880	994880	I know.
994880	995880	Pulling the plug on.
995880	1000280	We will be taking the horse out to the barn and shooting it on Saturday.
1000280	1002680	No, they will become glue.
1002680	1007400	I know we make fun of it here, and some of the, like, even some folks in chat were commenting
1007400	1011720	earlier like, boy, they sure sound like they're going to miss the 24-7 feed.
1011720	1012720	We are.
1012720	1014080	We're going to miss it.
1014080	1018280	But at the same time, you know what, it's kind of like one of the songs in the pre-show
1018280	1020880	tonight, which had a very tongue-in-cheek theme tonight if you were listening our little
1020880	1021880	pre-show music.
1021880	1023520	A change will do you good.
1023520	1026160	So this is going to be something new for us.
1026160	1027480	It's going to be fun.
1027480	1030240	So that's that.
1030240	1033800	Zappi says, will there be punch at the plug pulling?
1033800	1034800	Punch and pat.
1034800	1036480	Punch and pat.
1036480	1042480	But not alcoholic punch because I don't want to go back to the hospital with more pancreatitis.
1042480	1043800	Please nod that.
1043800	1046840	So we're excited, though, about allgames.com.
1046840	1053600	I still don't have the final word for you on Travis and DMN and all that, but if I had
1053600	1058980	a Magic 8-Ball and I shook it, it would say Outlook looks good.
1058980	1062560	They're probably going to come over a little later than us, but we'll be there on Sunday
1062560	1063560	the 13th.
1063560	1064560	Excited.
1064560	1067600	All right, enough housekeeping.
1067600	1071200	Let's get into gaming news that we can taunt to make fun of.
1071200	1072200	Loki.
1072200	1074600	Okay, so this is pretty awesome.
1074600	1078280	It's been rumored to be happening, but finally official now.
1078280	1084640	Sam and Max are coming to the Wii, and of course it's being brought to us in the U.S.
1084640	1089980	by Dreamcatcher and of course the adventure company, and in Europe, Joe Wood of course
1089980	1094160	is publishing it there.
1094160	1097200	Not really any word on what exactly it will include.
1097200	1101640	Probably a lot of the episodes that we saw on the PC.
1101640	1105680	Don't know if maybe it's a compilation of season one, maybe something like season two.
1105680	1106680	Who knows?
1106680	1110240	Maybe it's even like, no, it's not going to have download content on the Wii.
1110240	1113660	But I don't know, it's pretty awesome, though.
1113660	1122600	So glad to be able to play some Sam and Max since I don't use GameTap or want to buy software.
1122600	1124480	And so that's going to be going to WiiWare?
1124480	1126440	I think that's actually going to be going to the Wii.
1126440	1128240	Oh, so it's not WiiWare.
1128240	1132800	Because I remember there was a rumor a while back that it was going to go to WiiWare.
1132800	1136680	I guess they could do it that way, but I don't think they would.
1136680	1139960	I think it'd just be the first season or something like that.
1139960	1140960	Yeah, that would be exciting.
1140960	1144840	I mean, if they package all the games together into one because the games themselves are
1144840	1150560	only three to four hours long, but if they package the entire first season, which was
1150560	1152840	like eight episodes, I want to say, I don't remember off the top of my head.
1152840	1155160	Maybe they could do the first and second season or something like that.
1155160	1159800	That would be a great deal because that would be, you know, you'd probably have like at
1159800	1163080	least 15 episodes all together in one place.
1163080	1165280	I think that would be a pretty good deal.
1165280	1168800	And yeah, for those people that don't really game on the PC or have GameTap or any of that,
1168800	1170200	I think it'll be pretty good.
1170200	1172360	So we will see what happens.
1172360	1174880	Are you going to check out Sam and Max if it comes to the Wii Dark Soccer?
1174880	1175880	No.
1175880	1176880	No?
1176880	1177880	Why not?
1177880	1178880	I'm not interested in it.
1178880	1179880	Aw, sorry to hear that.
1179880	1181600	Drew Nami, are you a Sam and Max fan?
1181600	1184400	Uh, used to be, as of the original.
1184400	1186840	You remember, you have to talk into a mic, or else people can't hear you.
1186840	1189680	I thought I turned on and pointed at me.
1189680	1190680	That's alright.
1190680	1196120	Uh, I'm probably going to play it, if I don't have to buy it.
1196120	1199640	Gotcha so if you can borrow it from somebody or something, you'll play it.
1199640	1200640	Gotcha.
1200640	1207880	Uh, Black Wolf, who's a big Sam and Max fan in chat, says the first season is six episodes
1207880	1209800	and the second season is five episodes.
1209800	1212320	You know, the reason why I probably thought it was eight is because of the time I went
1212320	1213800	on the game tab to check it out.
1213800	1217240	Probably we had the six and then two from the second season, so I probably thought,
1217240	1218240	oh, there's eight of them.
1218240	1219240	Okay, six and five.
1219240	1223800	Still, that's not a bad deal for eleven episodes.
1223800	1226640	That's still pretty it's because it'll be a thirty, forty hour game, that's the size
1226640	1228640	of most games.
1228640	1230000	That'll be a good deal.
1230000	1235520	Uh, this is also going to be a good deal, would be a Super Smash Bros. Brawl sequel.
1235520	1242320	It's also kind of a duh, but at the same time, it would be interesting if a Brawl sequel
1242320	1246480	came to the Wii, because if you think about the previous Nintendo consoles, they only
1246480	1249440	had one Smash Bros. game apiece.
1249440	1253160	Nintendo 64 had that Smash Bros. game, which I want to say was originally developed for
1253160	1258320	the Super Nintendo, but was brought over to the 64 when the, you know, console life switched
1258320	1259320	up a little bit.
1259320	1263640	Uh, and then the GameCube had one, now the Wii has its one, so it'd be kind of weird
1263640	1265160	if there was a second one on the Wii.
1265160	1268160	I don't think Nintendo plans to move away from the Wii anytime soon, so it would be
1268160	1270000	kind of interesting if we got a sequel.
1270000	1271560	What is the basis for this?
1271560	1275640	Well, Nintendo is, in one of their latest surveys, they do these surveys all the time
1275640	1280260	on their website, they're asking a question about how likely would you be to buy a sequel
1280260	1284000	to Super Smash Bros. Brawl on a scale of one to seven?
1284000	1287400	One being I wouldn't buy it, seven being I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
1287400	1290880	I'm sure most people are saying, seven, seven, seven!
1290880	1293780	I don't know how many people wouldn't say seven, but it'll be interesting.
1293780	1297640	What else can they do with, uh, Smash Bros. Brawl?
1297640	1298640	I mean...
1298640	1299640	A DS version?
1299640	1302040	Ah, there you go.
1302040	1303720	I bet, I bet that's it.
1303720	1307400	I bet that's exactly what they're gonna do, I bet it'll be a DS version.
1307400	1311360	You think if there was a DS version it would be just a dumbed down, uh, same version you
1311360	1314920	kind of have on the Wii now, or do you think they'd, uh, actually take the time to make
1314920	1317880	something kind of new, maybe with some more DS-centric characters?
1317880	1321360	Well, keep in mind the DS is basically a handheld Nintendo 64.
1321360	1322960	I guess that's true.
1322960	1327800	So it'd probably be more like a throwback to the old Smash Bros.
1327800	1328800	True.
1328800	1332720	Of course they're gonna whore this out, you know, but I don't think it's gonna come any
1332720	1333720	time soon.
1333720	1337920	I think it'll be at least maybe a year or two off if they're gonna do something like
1337920	1338920	that.
1338920	1342280	Jaded in chat says, the PictoChat level where you can draw your own pics.
1342280	1343640	That might be kind of fun.
1343640	1347320	I bet the online, online seems to work a little better on the DS than it does on the Wii.
1347320	1349240	I bet online would work better.
1349240	1351440	Yeah, I guess.
1351440	1354320	The PictoChat level would be full of, like, cocks or something.
1354320	1360800	I'm just, I'm not too, I'm not too confident with, uh, Nintendo and their online.
1360800	1364680	Ross Steel UT says, I say we bring back the Virtual Boy with Smash Bros.
1364680	1365680	No!
1365680	1366680	Yes.
1366680	1367680	I do not want a migraine.
1367680	1369520	Or, unless it's a playable character, that'd be cool.
1369520	1370880	I would not mind the migraine.
1370880	1374400	They should do a Super Nintendo version of Smash Bros., that'd be cool.
1374400	1375400	Why?
1375400	1376400	It's gone!
1376400	1377840	The system's, like, dead and gone.
1377840	1380360	It's as dead as this station.
1380360	1383160	Bring it on to the, uh, DS.
1383160	1384600	Do it all 2D.
1384600	1387320	I would, I would believe that a Smash Bros. would come to DS.
1387320	1391800	Do a Smash Bros. game in, like, the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 engine or something like that.
1391800	1392800	Well, we'll see what happens.
1392800	1394800	Maybe the arcade Smash Bros., eh.
1394800	1397280	Maybe that'll be the thing, is they'll get third parties on board.
1397280	1398280	I don't know.
1398280	1399280	We'll see.
1399280	1402000	But, uh, regardless, I'm sure that this survey is a no-brainer.
1402000	1404020	It depends on who they're surveying.
1404020	1407080	If they surveyed us, I'm sure we'd all be saying, why even waste money on a friggin'
1407080	1408080	survey like that?
1408080	1412840	Well, I think it's one sequel, so for a really popular game, I have no idea.
1412840	1415480	In other news, water is indeed wet.
1415480	1419920	Oh, and Jamie, just think of the Virtual Boy possibilities, you can have the Teleroboxer
1419920	1420920	stage.
1420920	1421920	No.
1421920	1422920	No.
1422920	1423920	No.
1423920	1424920	No.
1424920	1426400	The migraines are not worth it.
1426400	1431780	My Virtual Boy is sealed in foam in a plastic case, never to be opened again.
1431780	1434120	I wanna play Virtual Boy.
1434120	1436120	I haven't played one in years, I was, like, 12.
1436120	1437120	I'll bring it next week.
1437120	1438120	I'll bring the Blockbuster one.
1438120	1439120	It'll be fun.
1439120	1441520	We have one of the ones that Blockbuster was selling, that's why we have the nice hard
1441520	1442520	case and everything.
1442520	1444680	Can we hook up Virtual Boy to Justin.tv somehow?
1444680	1446880	Have the headache cam?
1446880	1449080	It wouldn't be easy, but you could do it.
1449080	1450280	That might be fun.
1450280	1454440	Yes, I say, we should have some type of competition with the Virtual Boy, like, who can play the
1454440	1456600	longest without having a seizure?
1456600	1457600	Throwing up.
1457600	1459360	Or throwing up.
1459360	1463880	And Cheeseburger in chat asks the definitive question, if Chuck Norris was in Brawl, what
1463880	1465680	would be his final smash?
1465680	1468400	An overused joke.
1468400	1473760	Don't you know that that hand is actually Chuck Norris' hand?
1473760	1476040	Let's move on to the next story, please, before the Chuck Norris jokes.
1476040	1478520	God, you guys are chinging to me.
1478520	1479520	That's okay.
1479520	1484740	Well, you know, there is actually, for anybody who has been waiting, and I know lots of people
1484740	1491400	have for Mario Kart Wii, there's gonna be a really awesome launch ready for it at midnight
1491400	1494920	on the verge of the 26th to the 27th.
1494920	1496760	And guess where it's gonna be?
1496760	1497760	My pants.
1497760	1498760	No.
1498760	1499760	Sam's Club!
1499760	1504180	Cause no one knows how to get down like Sam's Club.
1504180	1509840	You can go to Sam's Club and it'll even have 15 Wii consoles on hand.
1509840	1513040	Will they have the ladies serving the samples of the little teeny weenies?
1513040	1514640	Dude, I would go just for that.
1514640	1519080	What they forget to mention is those 15 Wii consoles are being sold together in like a
1519080	1521680	giant family pack of Wiis.
1521680	1529120	No, it's the Wii plus like 50 controllers and shitty games and a box of Fruit Loops.
1529120	1533120	The Sam's Club actually realized that they're not a club and they're just a store.
1533120	1536240	And a two gallon container of mayonnaise.
1536240	1541640	Cause, you know, when you think video games, you think Sam's Club.
1541640	1546200	I bought the Vio at Sam's Club.
1546200	1547200	Here's my question.
1547200	1550480	It's all Sam's Clubs that are doing this or is it just a few?
1550480	1557680	It's not actually saying a few, it's just saying Sam's Club.
1557680	1559440	We should party down at Sam's Club.
1559440	1560440	Here's what I'm thinking.
1560440	1566200	If it is at every Sam's Club, we go to the Sam's Club out in freaking Roseville, okay?
1566200	1568400	Cause Roseville knows how to get down, okay?
1568400	1570400	There's like a lot of retired people out in Roseville.
1570400	1573120	Okay, what we'll do, we'll go there and we'll dress to the nine.
1573120	1579540	Like we'll dress in party hats and boas and you know, we have those hats.
1579540	1583200	We have those hats, the little Mario hats that Rama gave us some time ago.
1583200	1585440	We can wear our little hats, it'd be fun.
1585440	1587440	Count me in.
1587440	1589080	You know what?
1589080	1590860	If they're doing it, we gotta do that.
1590860	1591860	You know what?
1591860	1592860	What?
1592860	1594940	I'll just have my copy the day it comes out.
1594940	1596440	You don't want to go party at Sam's Club?
1596440	1597960	I'll go come home with Smash Brothers.
1597960	1600320	Dude, two gallons of mayonnaise, Jamie.
1600320	1601320	Rob.
1601320	1602320	What?
1602320	1603320	Rob.
1603320	1604320	Rob.
1604320	1605320	What?
1605320	1607440	Loki, are you down with the Sam's Club party?
1607440	1610760	Fuck that, I'll probably already have the game by the time the thing launches.
1610760	1612400	God, you people are no fun at all.
1612400	1613400	You don't go for the game.
1613400	1615440	I sit in line for a wee.
1615440	1617160	How can I get excited about Sam's Club?
1617160	1618160	That's the point.
1618160	1619160	That's the point.
1619160	1623440	We took our lawn chairs and sat in line for a wee.
1623440	1628040	We'll probably go there and be like, sorry, we're not doing the launch party and be like,
1628040	1629040	crap.
1629040	1632760	I will go and you know why, because I have nothing better to do.
1632760	1638240	Will anyone go party at Sam's Club with me?
1638240	1642920	Well if you don't want to go to Sam's Club to get Mario Kart, maybe you want to go to
1642920	1644800	Japan to get Trauma Center 2.
1644800	1648400	That's right, the game is actually being slated for the DS.
1648400	1649680	It's coming back.
1649680	1657400	I guess the second opinion wasn't really a sequel then, but Trauma Center 2 and I guess
1657400	1663680	the sequel has Dr. Stiles and Nurse Angie tackling the effects of the unanswered mysteries
1663680	1667040	of the guilt virus from the prequel.
1667040	1671260	See, the guilt virus is the guilt that you have from not buying the wee version.
1671260	1676480	That kind of surprises me that the latest one they had on the Nintendo Wii was not Trauma
1676480	1677480	Center 2.
1677480	1679640	I just kind of took it as Trauma Center 2.
1679640	1685920	Of course, there's going to be new characters and different tools and stuff like that.
1685920	1689000	But pretty much par for the course stuff.
1689000	1692400	Trauma Center is one of those games where I swear it's one of those blink and you miss
1692400	1699880	it kind of games, but to quote an epic story that once aired on the station and on the
1699880	1704120	nightly news here locally, it's so much fun.
1704120	1705560	Trauma Center is so much fun.
1705560	1709640	I like making them die.
1709640	1711640	I do too.
1711640	1714300	I love the whole bringing them back to life.
1714300	1723040	The Wii controls in that game are really cool because when you have to do the whole defibrillator
1723040	1725320	you have to push into the screen onto the body.
1725320	1726320	It's really funny.
1726320	1728000	I like Trauma Center.
1728000	1731760	I would think you of all people, Loki, Trauma Center would be one of your favorites.
1731760	1737600	No, I liked it better when it was called Life and Death and came out early PCs back when
1737600	1739240	they had Windows 3.1.
1739240	1744120	Life or death was hardcore and everybody and the only surgeries you'd do would be removing
1744120	1745120	appendixes.
1745120	1748120	Oh my God, life or death was hardcore though.
1748120	1751080	If you screwed up in that game, you were killing patients left and right.
1751080	1752080	It was a very hard game.
1752080	1754500	Hence why it's called Life and Death in that life and maybe...
1754500	1758320	They should have called it Life but Mostly Death because that's what that game was.
1758320	1761900	I was like, I'm going to scribble with the scalpel and you have to read all this stuff
1761900	1764760	before you go and do the surgeries, but we didn't like to read.
1764760	1765760	We just wanted the scalpel.
1765760	1766760	That's true.
1766760	1767760	Trauma Center...
1767760	1768760	Calcipa makes the best suggestion.
1768760	1770320	In chat, what do you say?
1770320	1772360	Psychological Trauma Center.
1772360	1775600	That would be kind of rad.
1775600	1776600	Yeah.
1776600	1777600	All right.
1777600	1778600	You know what else is going to be...
1778600	1779600	What?
1779600	1783240	I was going to say, oh no, I have to repair your daddy left you or something.
1783240	1785440	That is so, so wrong.
1785440	1786440	Scalpel.
1786440	1787440	Look.
1787440	1789120	We can start with celebrities.
1789120	1790120	I know.
1790120	1791120	Yeah.
1791120	1792520	See, celebrities are okay to make fun of.
1792520	1794280	Remember, Dennis Leary said it best.
1794280	1798400	The best way for all those celebrities, the best therapy for them is Shut the Fuck Up
1798400	1800720	by Dr. Dennis Leary.
1800720	1802840	All right, look.
1802840	1803840	Let's move on to games.
1803840	1808220	I do want Trauma Center 2, but I definitely, definitely want this.
1808220	1812800	I was actually surprised to hear that Final Fantasy IV was not already confirmed for North
1812800	1816520	America, but then again, this is Squeenix we're talking about.
1816520	1823160	But apparently this week, Final Fantasy IV director Takashi Tokita did confirm that Final
1823160	1826080	Fantasy IV is being localized for North America.
1826080	1828040	That was in the latest issue of Nintendo Power.
1828040	1829040	Okay, wait.
1829040	1830040	Scratch that.
1830040	1836840	He didn't actually confirm the localization, but I mean, there was English language screenshots
1836840	1839280	in the article.
1839280	1841480	It's on the cover of the freaking magazine.
1841480	1843920	I think it's safe to say the game's coming out over here.
1843920	1847000	I think it's safe to say the game's coming out here.
1847000	1848860	I wouldn't know or anything.
1848860	1851160	Would you know about when the game is coming out here by chance?
1851160	1856200	I would say it's coming out around here somewhere around here.
1856200	1858200	In time for my birthday?
1858200	1859200	No.
1859200	1860200	Damn it.
1860200	1862920	I can't get you what I was going to get you for your birthday.
1862920	1865280	Of course, I don't remember when your birthday is, unfortunately.
1865280	1866280	June 26th.
1866280	1867280	Don't forget it.
1867280	1868280	No.
1868280	1869280	It's not going to be out for my birthday?
1869280	1870280	No.
1870280	1871280	Will it be out in July?
1871280	1872280	Maybe.
1872280	1873760	Can we play hot and cold?
1873760	1875760	Is it July 15th?
1875760	1876760	Warm.
1876760	1877760	July 17th.
1877760	1878760	Warmer.
1878760	1879760	July 24th.
1879760	1880760	No, still warm.
1880760	1881760	July 18th.
1881760	1882760	What's a Tuesday?
1882760	1883760	Hold on.
1883760	1884760	Pulling up a calendar.
1884760	1889760	This is how we get Loki to tell us secrets now.
1889760	1890760	July 22nd.
1890760	1891760	No.
1891760	1892760	July 15th.
1892760	1893760	No.
1893760	1894760	Are they putting it on a Sunday or something?
1894760	1895760	July 20th.
1895760	1896760	No, further.
1896760	1897760	Forget it.
1897760	1898760	It's close to August, okay?
1898760	1899760	July 29th.
1899760	1900760	No.
1900760	1901760	God.
1901760	1902760	July 27th.
1902760	1903760	Right now, it's at the end of July, okay?
1903760	1904760	Let's just see what that is.
1904760	1905760	That's not the only game coming over here.
1905760	1906760	Oh, whatever.
1906760	1907760	No.
1907760	1908760	No.
1908760	1909760	No.
1909760	1910760	No.
1910760	1911760	No.
1911760	1912760	No.
1912760	1913760	No.
1913760	1914760	Should we run it over here?
1914760	1915760	Oh, what else?
1915760	1917200	Uh, just another game.
1917200	1918900	Is it Chrono Trigger?
1918900	1919900	It's not Chrono Trigger.
1919900	1920900	Is it Chrono Trigger?
1920900	1924360	It's another DS game that's already in Japan right now, that I'm showing you the title
1924360	1925360	for.
1925360	1926640	Can I please say that on-
1926640	1927800	Go ahead.
1927800	1929080	Dragon Quest V.
1929080	1930080	Yeah.
1930080	1931480	Wait, what?
1931480	1934000	Dragon Quest V.
1934000	1936100	That's apparently getting localized as well.
1936100	1937400	Excuse me for a second.
1937400	1938400	Should be fun.
1938400	1940880	Did you just squee in your pants?
1940880	1941880	What the hell was that noise?
1941880	1943080	No, I just squee'd into the mic.
1943080	1951000	Actually, there's another game coming out too, the same day as Final Fantasy IV, but
1951000	1952000	it's not for the DS.
1952000	1959040	It's actually a 360 RPG that's by Square Enix, although it's got the weirdest title ever,
1959040	1964240	Infinite Undiscovery, so that should be coming around at the same time.
1964240	1967520	But a lot of stuff can move.
1967520	1968520	But they're coming.
1968520	1972840	Alright, so Dragon Quest V, Final Fantasy IV in July, you didn't hear it here.
1972840	1973840	You did not hear it.
1973840	1974840	It might not be July.
1974840	1975840	That's true.
1975840	1976840	Games get pushed back all the time.
1976840	1977840	Alright.
1977840	1980120	I have to do Dragon Quest VI, now we're hulking.
1980120	1983240	Alright, so, but still, where's Chrono Trigger?
1983240	1985560	I mean, that's the game everybody wants, right?
1985560	1987160	You can pretty much, okay, let me put it this way.
1987160	1992940	If it's a Square Enix RPG, and it's being made in Japan, and it's come out in Japan,
1992940	1995600	you can bet it's going to be localized for here.
1995600	1997320	Mother 3.
1997320	1998320	That's not a Square Enix game.
1998320	1999320	That was it.
1999320	2000320	That was...
2000320	2001320	Nintendo themselves.
2001320	2002320	Yeah, that was Nintendo.
2002320	2005680	That's what I call them now, if we're not bringing that over here.
2005680	2006680	Bastard Nintendo.
2006680	2007680	Yes, they did.
2007680	2008680	It came out over there.
2008680	2009680	Why not here?
2009680	2010680	Well, just...
2010680	2011680	What's up with that, Nintendo?
2011680	2015040	Because the same people that own Nintendo own Live 365.
2015040	2020880	I'll take a detour for a minute to say hello to Rice Princess, who showed up 39 minutes
2020880	2021880	late.
2021880	2022880	How are you?
2022880	2023880	I'm good and late.
2023880	2024880	How about you?
2024880	2025880	I'm fine.
2025880	2026880	Awesome.
2026880	2027880	I got you a present.
2027880	2028880	Okay, then I forgive you for being late.
2028880	2029880	Ooh!
2029880	2030880	Is that it for me?
2030880	2031880	This is it for you.
2031880	2032880	Ooh!
2032880	2033880	That looks so pretty.
2033880	2034880	It's kind of random.
2034880	2036880	It is, but they were on sale, and I'm like, oh, they have penguins.
2036880	2037880	I will like it.
2037880	2039720	They're floor mats for the car with penguins on them.
2039720	2040720	They're so cute here.
2040720	2041720	Wow.
2041720	2042720	I accept your gift.
2042720	2043720	Woo-hoo!
2043720	2044720	In lieu of being late.
2044720	2046520	Your offering pleases kitty.
2046520	2048320	It smells like new car.
2048320	2049320	All right.
2049320	2050320	Oh, that's weird.
2050320	2052120	I'm getting high on the floor mats.
2052120	2054240	And I have to say one other thing.
2054240	2057760	I got a Captain Crunch Malt from Carl's Jr.
2057760	2060120	It is so fucking, I mean, flippin' good.
2060120	2061120	Yeah?
2061120	2062120	It is.
2062120	2063120	It is fucking good.
2063120	2064120	It's free radio.
2064120	2065120	Yeah.
2065120	2066120	Oh, my God.
2066120	2067120	It's so yummy.
2067120	2068120	I know.
2068120	2069120	What are they going to do?
2069120	2070120	Cancel us?
2070120	2071120	Sorry.
2071120	2072120	You cannot be on our station anymore.
2072120	2073120	But, yeah, it's pretty good.
2073120	2074120	So, yeah.
2074120	2075120	Okay.
2075120	2076120	Excellent.
2076120	2078640	I think we should try to set some sort of Guinness Book of World Records for the most
2078640	2081480	time fuck has occurred in a podcast.
2081480	2083040	Maybe for our first all-game show.
2083040	2084040	That'll be a nice...
2084040	2085040	Great idea.
2085040	2086040	That'll be great.
2086040	2087040	We'll bring a little bell and everything.
2087040	2088280	That'll be, that'll be, no.
2088280	2089280	We got to do one show.
2089280	2092160	We have to do one show over there to get them to like us.
2092160	2093160	For those that haven't heard us yet.
2093160	2095160	It doesn't have to be the first show.
2095160	2096160	Yeah.
2096160	2097160	Besides those...
2097160	2098160	Yeah, that might do it with that crowd.
2098160	2102120	Those Guinness Records, you have to have somebody on hand to, like, record, you know.
2102120	2103640	It has to be all official and stuff.
2103640	2107080	No, what we'll do, what we'll do the second show over there will be the fuck show.
2107080	2108080	We'll do that.
2108080	2109080	Yay.
2109080	2110080	We'll lose all of our listeners in one show.
2110080	2111080	All right.
2111080	2112080	And we'll have one of those little...
2112080	2119600	We'll do it South Park style, we'll have one of those little click counters in the corner
2119600	2120600	of the Justin TV feed.
2120600	2121600	We'll do it.
2121600	2122600	We'll do it.
2122600	2123600	Bobby.
2123600	2124600	Fuck show.
2124600	2127880	Y or N. Bobby's in chat right now.
2127880	2130560	Also say hello to Nathan, who's here.
2130560	2131560	Hello.
2131560	2132660	How are you?
2132660	2133800	I am fine.
2133800	2137620	Was the Captain Crunch milkshake flipping fantastic?
2137620	2138620	It was.
2138620	2139620	It was?
2139620	2140620	Glad to hear it.
2140620	2141620	I can't drink it or it might kill me.
2141620	2147360	Because I have to stay away from high fat foods for a month.
2147360	2150720	But if they had Captain Crunch Jell-O, I'd be all over that shit.
2150720	2152720	I'll make you.
2152720	2153720	Yay.
2153720	2157320	Rob, you should have a smoothie.
2157320	2159560	Black Wolf says why.
2159560	2161960	So fuck show it is.
2161960	2163160	So what night is that?
2163160	2166320	It wouldn't be April 13th, it would be the 20th.
2166320	2169200	It would be the show the day after my birthday.
2169200	2172080	Well fuck, I'm in.
2172080	2175520	I think that's a great idea because I'm going to be gone most of that week.
2175520	2176960	You're going to come for my birthday stuff, right?
2176960	2177960	I can't.
2177960	2179960	I'm going to be out of town.
2179960	2180960	I'm sorry.
2180960	2182960	Alright, anyway.
2182960	2183960	We'll figure something out.
2183960	2184960	It will be our late April-
2184960	2186800	Oh my god, the show is on 4-20.
2186800	2188320	It has to be a fuck show.
2188320	2189320	Yes.
2189320	2190320	I know.
2190320	2191320	Alright.
2191320	2192320	Enough about the fuck show.
2192320	2193320	Jamie, Brownies?
2193320	2195280	Irene had enough time to go to the bathroom and back and we're still talking about the
2195280	2196280	fuck show.
2196280	2197280	Wow.
2197280	2198280	It's going to be on 4-20.
2198280	2203360	It's going to be like a really slow, mellow fuck show like, hey man, like, fuck.
2203360	2204360	No.
2204360	2205360	Here's the deal.
2205360	2206360	I think this is the rule.
2206360	2207360	These are the rules for the fuck show.
2207360	2208360	Okay.
2208360	2209360	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2209360	2210360	What?
2210360	2211360	4-20 is marijuana day.
2211360	2212360	It's not cuss day.
2212360	2214360	I don't get the correlation here.
2214360	2215360	It doesn't matter.
2215360	2216360	Look, we make the rules.
2216360	2217360	Alright?
2217360	2218360	Who fucking cares?
2218360	2219360	Exactly.
2219360	2220360	What do we want?
2220360	2221360	Here's the thing.
2221360	2222360	We have to do the show completely normal.
2222360	2225760	Like, we do the show as always because we don't want to lose all our podcast listeners.
2225760	2231240	But the contest is who can work the word fuck into their stories the most times and we'll
2231240	2233200	have, like, a running tally.
2233200	2235200	Who can work the word into the show?
2235200	2236200	That's brilliant.
2236200	2240080	I have created a monster and it's fucking awesome.
2240080	2241080	A brilliant monster.
2241080	2242720	We should make that an annual thing.
2242720	2243720	That would be funny.
2243720	2244720	Alright.
2244720	2245720	More details to come.
2245720	2247400	See, I love live radio.
2247400	2248400	I love it.
2248400	2250320	I cannot imagine not doing this show live.
2250320	2252980	Can you imagine if we had to leave Live65 and do a tape show?
2252980	2256120	The magic of doing a live show creates things such as the fuck show.
2256120	2261320	We'd be like Mariah Carey because she lip syncs her songs all the time.
2261320	2263600	That's the dumbest joke I've heard in my entire life.
2263600	2264600	Shut up!
2264600	2265600	It's recent because she recently...
2265600	2266600	Forget it, Daniel.
2266600	2267600	It's recently lame.
2267600	2268600	You're recently.
2268600	2269600	You're always lame.
2269600	2271480	Jamie News.
2271480	2274120	In other news, I has a ferret and you bitches don't.
2274120	2277340	I mean, wait.
2277340	2284320	More stuff for the Wii but not the DS is Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo's Dungeon will be coming
2284320	2291360	out in the summer over here and it's happy and makes me go squee and it'll be $39.99.
2291360	2293280	It's about time.
2293280	2296960	It's essentially the game that was on the DS like already.
2296960	2298840	So we're getting a DS port on the Wii now.
2298840	2300560	Well, I think it may be remade a little bit.
2300560	2302880	I mean, Wii is like the porting system.
2302880	2305520	First it was all our PS2 games get ported with Waggle.
2305520	2306520	Now we're getting DS games.
2306520	2307520	Well, I guess that's nothing new.
2307520	2308520	We had Cookin' Mama.
2308520	2310520	It's, it's cute and it goes quee.
2310520	2314840	Are you going to buy the game just because the Chocobo goes quee?
2314840	2315840	Yeah.
2315840	2316840	I am.
2316840	2321040	Loki, will you hack the game so the Chocobo goes fuck?
2321040	2325120	No, I don't know how to do that.
2325120	2326120	Not yet.
2326120	2327120	Not yet.
2327120	2334320	Anyways, so it has been recently discovered that Konami has trademarked a new name for
2334320	2336160	a Castlevania game.
2336160	2340960	The title of the game, which is assumed to be for the DS, is Castlevania.
2340960	2345440	Order of, and I can't even pronounce the rest, it looks like Ekklesia.
2345440	2349060	Ekklesia, yeah, that's right.
2349060	2350060	Order of Ekklesia.
2350060	2352200	Is that a musical term?
2352200	2354720	I thought all the Castlevania games had to have music in them.
2354720	2355720	Portrait of Ruin did not.
2355720	2356720	Oh yeah, Portrait of Ruin.
2356720	2360120	It has to be something artsy and this one's more like logic.
2360120	2361120	Ekklesia.
2361120	2362120	Ekklesia.
2362120	2363120	I don't know.
2363120	2365120	Stop making up words.
2365120	2371960	I suspect that this game will have someone in the Belmont family fighting a vampire,
2371960	2377680	probably Dracula, and there will be whips of some sort and possibly magic and hearts
2377680	2378680	and stuff.
2378680	2380440	Okay, hold on.
2380440	2383000	I'm using my mind reading techniques right now.
2383000	2390120	Something tells me this game will have holy water as a weapon.
2390120	2391120	And crosses.
2391120	2392120	Yes, and crosses.
2392120	2393120	Maybe daggers.
2393120	2394120	And an axe.
2394120	2399200	And one of the characters will have a whip.
2399200	2402200	You heard it here first, I'm telling you.
2402200	2409240	When are they going to have a Castlevania game where you fight the Belmonts?
2409240	2412000	They have had one, Symphony of the Night.
2412000	2413000	You fight the Belmonts?
2413000	2414000	You fight Richter?
2414000	2415000	That's right.
2415000	2416000	Wasn't that at the second castle?
2416000	2418600	Sort of, but he's not like the main boss.
2418600	2421760	He is unless you go do the thing where you have to go fight Shaft.
2421760	2425960	He is the main boss, totally, if you're not wearing the sunglasses.
2425960	2426960	Exactly.
2426960	2428360	That's the only time he actually is.
2428360	2430320	And there's Aria of Sorrow.
2430320	2431320	I hadn't played that one.
2431320	2433000	He is a boss, though.
2433000	2434560	Richter is awesome.
2434560	2438200	I like his Ryu look and Rondo of Blood.
2438200	2441560	I mean like you fight the Belmont family.
2441560	2442560	Like they're the bad guys.
2442560	2443560	All of them.
2443560	2448000	Like, I don't know, because you always fight Dracula or something like that.
2448000	2449000	It's like, come on.
2449000	2450000	Poor Shaft.
2450000	2451000	Castlevania.
2451000	2453440	He fucks up the Belmont family reunion.
2453440	2454440	DS.
2454440	2455440	Aw, yeah.
2455440	2458640	Dracula's gonna fuck you up.
2458640	2461880	I would get me to buy a Castlevania game again.
2461880	2465080	I haven't really been into the Castlevania series on the DS.
2465080	2466080	I don't know why.
2466080	2467520	I love the Castlevania series.
2467520	2469440	I don't like the 3D Castlevanias.
2469440	2471160	I mean, they're okay.
2471160	2472160	Like what?
2472160	2473160	64?
2473160	2474160	No.
2474160	2475160	Like Lament of Innocence.
2475160	2476160	Oh, yeah, yeah.
2476160	2477160	Curse of Darkness.
2477160	2478160	They're okay.
2478160	2479480	I like my 2D Castlevania.
2479480	2481560	Yeah, I understand that.
2481560	2482560	Yeah.
2482560	2487160	Well, despite whatever it is they're putting out on the DS, it's working, because Nintendo
2487160	2493560	is supreme when it comes to Japanese hardware and software sales, and this is per the latest
2493560	2495040	issue of Famitsu Magazine.
2495040	2499880	The Nintendo DS and the Wii have sold 6.3 and 3.7 million units.
2499880	2502640	That's 6.3 million for the DS, 3.7 for the Wii.
2502640	2507980	And Wii Fit is selling like crazy in Japan, 1.76 million units.
2507980	2514360	Nintendo has the top five spots in software, so this is still selling like crazy in Japan.
2514360	2520280	I'm not sure how this is news, because that's kind of obvious to me, but it's been circulating
2520280	2522840	in the blogs this week, so we thought we'd let you know.
2522840	2527080	But if you want to know what the top five games are right now out of the house of Nintendo,
2527080	2533140	Wii Fit, Mario Party DS, I actually kind of surprised me that's so high, Wii Sports, because
2533140	2537600	I believe in Japan they sold it separately, don't forget, Super Smash Brothers Brawl,
2537600	2539440	and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.
2539440	2542220	Those are the top five games.
2542220	2544960	Don't hate on Pokemon, don't hate.
2544960	2546880	I don't hate as much as I want.
2546880	2550320	Pokemon Mystery Dungeon doesn't really count because it's two games, so.
2550320	2551320	That rhymes.
2551320	2553840	Oh, that's true, that's a little bit of cheating, isn't it?
2553840	2554840	Yeah.
2554840	2555840	All right, cheaters.
2555840	2556840	Pokey cheaters, cheater-mons.
2556840	2557840	Cheater-mons.
2557840	2558840	Cheater, cheater.
2558840	2564120	All right, so yeah, Nintendo's making a lot of money in Japan.
2564120	2565120	Go Fig.
2565120	2566120	Wow, that's news.
2566120	2567960	What else is new?
2567960	2570200	I don't know, you tell me what else is new.
2570200	2574840	This has to do with old stuff for something new.
2574840	2580200	There has been a fact sheet released for details on Mario Kart Wii, and for anyone who's wanting
2580200	2585960	to play with their classic controller or the GameCube controller, it has been said that
2585960	2591360	certain moves will not be able to be used with those controllers.
2591360	2592360	Like snaking?
2592360	2593360	I say hooray.
2593360	2594360	Oh, wait, they do-
2594360	2595360	It doesn't say specifically.
2595360	2599320	Ah, they took snaking out of the game altogether, I think we talked about that last week, but
2599320	2600320	that's good.
2600320	2606080	But it's basically saying that by using the Wiimote and Nunchuk together, you're supposed
2606080	2611000	to have full playability in the game, but those people are going to have an advantage
2611000	2613380	over the people using the older controller schemes.
2613380	2617640	I have a feeling that it's not so bad as people are making it out to be.
2617640	2622000	I think it'll probably be because I think you can do different little tricks and stuff,
2622000	2626920	not just one trick when you're doing jumps to get boosts and stuff.
2626920	2631840	So you probably will be able to do one trick on the GameCube or classic controller or something
2631840	2637300	like that, and then the people that have the Wii can use the controller to do different
2637300	2638960	tricks using the motion controls.
2638960	2644340	Because with that controller turned sideways or something, there's definitely not that
2644340	2648720	many buttons to use, and so a lot of it's motion controls, so I don't see why they couldn't
2648720	2653160	translate that stuff into button presses.
2653160	2654160	It's just sheer laziness.
2654160	2657800	Do you think the game's going to control as well with the classic controller anyway?
2657800	2661440	Because it seems to me like this game is going to be calibrated for that motion control that
2661440	2663440	an analog stick can't quite replicate.
2663440	2664440	You know what I mean?
2664440	2666600	I still think it'll be fine with the classic controller.
2666600	2669720	I've played Brawl with the classic controller, and I plan on playing this game.
2669720	2670720	But it's different.
2670720	2672720	Brawl doesn't rely on motion so much, you know what I mean?
2672720	2676880	I plan on playing this game with the classic controller, and if that doesn't work, there's
2676880	2681680	always the remote nunchuck, which you can just use the analog stick on that, and then
2681680	2685840	some of the motion controls with the remote, because that's not gimped on it.
2685840	2689400	But I don't think it's going to be a big deal, and the fact that they would do that to try
2689400	2694840	to force people to buy their stupid, you know, possibly use their stupid steering wheel controller
2694840	2698520	or something like that, I think it's kind of lame.
2698520	2702520	Besides, that steering wheel's going to give them problems.
2702520	2703520	We'll see.
2703520	2706240	I'm looking forward to the game nevertheless.
2706240	2709160	It's going to control a lot differently, that's for sure.
2709160	2712600	But as long as it's better than Double Dash.
2712600	2713600	Yeah.
2713600	2715760	Well, this is kind of neat.
2715760	2720520	It's a homemade game for the Nintendo system.
2720520	2722700	It's a game called Glider.
2722700	2725000	It's made by a company called Retro Zone.
2725000	2728200	I guess it's a remake, I think, of a game that came out on the Mac or something like
2728200	2729200	that.
2729200	2735960	But the interesting thing about it is the game will have download content, but it's
2735960	2737440	not as easy as it sounds.
2737440	2743480	It's not just like something you can pop into, I don't know, the internet and download it.
2743480	2748800	You actually have to reflash the cart, and it requires a $70 accessory to do it.
2748800	2750280	Wow, what a bargain.
2750280	2754720	But you can get new levels and stuff, and that same accessory will let you dump ROMs
2754720	2756520	and crap like that.
2756520	2761560	But it's just still kind of neat to see them actually, first off, making new games, and
2761560	2766680	secondly, allowing you to add new levels to it.
2766680	2771360	Aren't there still new games for the Nintendo being made in countries like Taiwan and stuff?
2771360	2776400	Because didn't we see a version of one of the Tekken games, like I get an NES port or
2776400	2777400	something recently?
2777400	2778400	I've seen some weird stuff.
2778400	2783200	Oh, and those RPGs I've been seeing, like Final Fantasy VII ported to the NES and that
2783200	2784200	stuff.
2784200	2785200	Yeah.
2785200	2789120	And then there's also one that I saw, which is Contra III, ported to the NES.
2789120	2792400	The Titanic game, that looked like tons of fun.
2792400	2795480	Yeah, so, I don't know.
2795480	2796480	It's interesting.
2796480	2800360	Hell, they're still making like, Vectrix games and stuff like that.
2800360	2803080	There's always a fan of something somewhere.
2803080	2807400	Would you play a game based off Titanic on the NES?
2807400	2809160	No.
2809160	2811040	Even though Leonardo DiCaprio dies?
2811040	2812040	No.
2812040	2816780	Well, if you are interested in playing this game, Glider, you can find it on the website
2816780	2819280	RetroUSB.com.
2819280	2825200	It's I believe like $50, no $42 currently it's on backorder, but it'll be coming out
2825200	2826200	early April.
2826200	2829360	The only bad thing about it is it's black and white, because I really do think it came
2829360	2835880	out originally on a Mac, the game, I guess it's from 1989.
2835880	2839720	But what's cool though is it comes with a cardboard box, a printed manual just like
2839720	2845560	the old NES games, and of course there's the black dust sleeve and that kind of thing.
2845560	2846560	And it's region free.
2846560	2847560	This is great.
2847560	2852320	Someone in Justin TV reminded me of this, Akuma JP in Justin TV Chats mentioned the
2852320	2860320	V. Not the we, but the V, speaking of innovative software to come out of other countries.
2860320	2862040	We need to get a V here in studio.
2862040	2863040	Are we able to do that?
2863040	2864040	They're expensive.
2864040	2865960	I don't really want one.
2865960	2868600	The company also makes some interesting things.
2868600	2877160	They have a game called Airball, another game called Sudoku 2007, and they make reproductions
2877160	2880720	of the Nintendo World Championship 1990 cards.
2880720	2881720	Nice.
2881720	2883120	That's pretty cool.
2883120	2884120	Sudoku, yay.
2884120	2885120	What?
2885120	2887120	I said Sudoku, yay.
2887120	2888120	Sudoku?
2888120	2889120	Yes.
2889120	2890120	Okay.
2890120	2891120	Shut up.
2891120	2896760	Let's see if there's some non-Sudoku games coming out on some very...
2896760	2897760	Shut up again.
2897760	2902280	I played a lot of Sudoku while I was in the hospital because I was really bored.
2902280	2903280	And?
2903280	2904280	And I don't want to ever play anymore.
2904280	2905280	Ew.
2905280	2906280	Shut up.
2906280	2907280	All right.
2907280	2908280	I just got split from our chat room.
2908280	2909280	Oh, everybody came back.
2909280	2910280	I guess the split got fixed.
2910280	2911560	Live radio.
2911560	2913400	It has its ups and downs.
2913400	2914400	Let's see.
2914400	2916840	Let's look at the release calendars for games coming out soon.
2916840	2918840	We'll start off in Japan.
2918840	2924360	Coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan on April the 10th, Turok is coming out.
2924360	2925360	Yay.
2925360	2926360	It's not...
2926360	2929240	Oh, yeah, did you pre-order your copy, right?
2929240	2930240	I did, yes.
2930240	2932240	And then I named my kid after Turok.
2932240	2933240	It was great.
2933240	2934240	Poor kid.
2934240	2937120	I wonder if he gets teased.
2937120	2938480	What grade would he be in now?
2938480	2940840	Like still in elementary school or...
2940840	2941840	What?
2941840	2942840	The kid that was named Turok.
2942840	2943840	I don't know.
2943840	2944840	You remember that contest?
2944840	2948080	They got paid a million dollars to name their kid Turok?
2948080	2949080	No, I don't remember that.
2949080	2951200	You host a video game show and you do not know this?
2951200	2953040	I don't remember old news.
2953040	2954600	It ain't that old.
2954600	2958080	This is like, I don't know, 10 years old or something.
2958080	2959080	All right.
2959080	2962960	By the way, we apologize that our audio is so fucked up in the studio tonight, but something
2962960	2968040	about that microphone that they're using in the back is really sensitive, so if you put
2968040	2969040	it like it...
2969040	2970040	Oh, I'm sorry.
2970040	2971040	I'll talk like right here.
2971040	2972040	There you go.
2972040	2973040	That's a perfect level.
2973040	2974040	Wonderful.
2974040	2975040	Live radio.
2975040	2977040	Back to Japan.
2977040	2982280	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mario Kart Wii makes its way out on April the 10th, as
2982280	2985600	well as Karous Wii.
2985600	2986760	That's not Kid Akaris.
2986760	2988640	That's K-A-R-O-U-S.
2988640	2992080	And then Neo Geo Stick 2 comes out as well.
2992080	2993080	I'm not sure if that's a joystick.
2993080	2995880	Oh, it's just a joystick.
2995880	2997880	I thought it was actually a game for a minute.
2997880	3000160	A stick figure game where you're trying to think of a stick fighter.
3000160	3001160	I don't know.
3001160	3002160	Stick Fighter, exactly.
3002160	3007320	On the PlayStation 2, Battle of Sunrise comes out from Sunrise Interactive, so I wonder
3007320	3009360	if it's like the employees fight each other.
3009360	3010360	That would be cool.
3010360	3012240	That would be actually kind of a rad game.
3012240	3013240	No.
3013240	3014240	This looks like...
3014240	3015240	What kind of game does this look like?
3015240	3020000	It looks like kind of like one of those robot fighting games that you see quite a bit of
3020000	3021000	in Japan.
3021000	3023440	It looks like it's got a tech element to it as well.
3023440	3029240	That must be the gist of it, probably some type of tech game.
3029240	3039560	Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS, Oshiri Kajiri Mushi no Rhythm Lesson DS comes
3039560	3040560	out from Sega.
3040560	3043040	Wait, did you say the first word was...
3043040	3045040	Oshiri Kajiri Mushi.
3045040	3047040	That means butt.
3047040	3051840	I'm probably just mispronouncing it because I horribly do that, but it's a music game.
3051840	3055900	Learn how to dance like these scary looking critters with flowers coming out of their
3055900	3059800	heads on the cover of the game.
3059800	3063720	Maybe they're saying move your butt, rhythm dancing, whatever it's called.
3063720	3064720	Maybe.
3064720	3067960	If you live in Japan and you've got no rhythm, hope is on the way.
3067960	3079360	On the PSP, the only game coming out on the 10th, Nanpure and Okake Puzzle 10,000 Mon.
3079360	3081920	I think it's just a Sudoku game.
3081920	3082920	I think that's what they call it.
3082920	3083920	Yay, Sudoku.
3083920	3084920	Oh, shut up.
3084920	3085920	You shut up.
3085920	3088560	How many Sudoku games do they have in the simple series?
3088560	3091320	It's just nuts.
3091320	3093400	It's silly because you can just play it for free online.
3093400	3095600	I don't know why you'd buy a game.
3095600	3100240	I'm going to remember that, though, that oshiri means butt.
3100240	3104040	Hey, Justin TV, want me to show my oshiri?
3104040	3107120	No, please don't proposition that.
3107120	3109360	I would have to see those.
3109360	3112680	Oh, my God, Glenn.
3112680	3113680	When did he get here?
3113680	3115880	Nobody knows who Glenn is, never mind.
3115880	3117880	Nobody knows that joke outside of wow.
3117880	3118880	I know.
3118880	3120560	I kind of regret saying that.
3120560	3130080	According to Alpha Canonogram, it's a butt-biting-bug game.
3130080	3132080	Sounds like fun.
3132080	3135200	All right.
3135200	3138840	And no, I'm not going to show my butt on the Justin TV cam because somebody would, some
3138840	3143080	sick asshole would highlight it, so I'm not going to do that.
3143080	3144720	Let's move on.
3144720	3148120	Let's move on with other release dates, please.
3148120	3149120	Okay.
3149120	3150920	How about some for the UK?
3150920	3151920	How about it?
3151920	3153640	A bunch of stuff on the 11th.
3153640	3159160	We have Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, Soldier of Fortune Payback,
3159160	3164560	The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific on a bunch of systems, Assassin's Creed, Altair's
3164560	3171840	Chronicles, Assassin's Creed, Director's Cut Edition, Draglade, Mario Kart Wii, Sam & Max
3171840	3174520	Episode 205, What's New, Beelzebub.
3174520	3178240	I think that's a funny name, although I still won't play the game.
3178240	3187680	UEFA Euro 2008, Victorious Boxers Challenge, so you can punch people in the face.
3187680	3189000	Sounds like fun.
3189000	3190120	That does sound like fun.
3190120	3192000	I want to punch people in the face.
3192000	3193840	Well, Drew's right there.
3193840	3194840	Hi.
3194840	3196840	Come here so I can punch you.
3196840	3200200	Is that it?
3200200	3201200	Yes.
3201200	3202200	Okay.
3202200	3205840	In the US, we're getting a bunch of crap this week.
3205840	3207920	Yay, crap.
3207920	3208920	My favorite.
3208920	3212720	Anyways, let's start things off right.
3212720	3216360	Dirty Dancing the Game is coming to PC.
3216360	3218720	Hooray.
3218720	3223040	There's a game for the DS called Fab Five Soccer, and no, it doesn't have anything to
3223040	3226000	do with Queer Eye, although that'd be weird.
3226000	3228240	There's a game called Plushies for the DS.
3228240	3229880	That's also another weird title.
3229880	3230880	Wow.
3230880	3231880	Awesome.
3231880	3233920	What the hell is wrong with us?
3233920	3234920	Make some games that aren't stupid.
3234920	3236800	Dude, they should make a game called Furries.
3236800	3238480	No, they shouldn't.
3238480	3240680	You know you would at least rent it, just to see what it's about.
3240680	3242280	No, I would not waste my money.
3242280	3243960	It's called Second Life.
3243960	3245880	It totally is.
3245880	3249640	The orange box is going to be broken up this week, so we have Half-Life 2, the episode
3249640	3254280	pack, which I believe is episode one and two.
3254280	3260800	Then we've also got Portal coming out on PC, and then finally, of course, Team Fortress
3260800	3262800	2.
3262800	3267760	On the Wii, Minicopter Adventure Flight, it's a game where you get to play around with a
3267760	3270520	RC helicopter.
3270520	3274020	There's also Summer Sports Paradise Island.
3274020	3279080	It's a Wii game with lawn darts, which are illegal, I guess, in the United States, but
3279080	3280080	now you can throw lawn darts.
3280080	3281480	Lawn darts are illegal here?
3281480	3282480	Yeah.
3282480	3283480	Dude, we had those growing up.
3283480	3284480	Yeah, they're illegal now.
3284480	3286480	Ooh, I'm reporting you to cop dog.
3286480	3287480	Don't fight it.
3287480	3288480	You don't know cop dog.
3288480	3289480	You don't know cop dog.
3289480	3290480	Report this.
3290480	3291480	Got hurt.
3291480	3292480	Let's see here.
3292480	3297200	Also on the Wii and PlayStation 2, Baroque is coming out this week.
3297200	3302720	On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart, which is an all-girl anime fighting game from Atlus.
3302720	3303720	Hot.
3303720	3312040	And also, Fetal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2, coming out on PlayStation 2 for $14.99.
3312040	3320920	On PC, we have Overclocked, a history of violence, Assassin's Creed.
3320920	3329160	And finally, oh, let's see here, Sam and Max Episode 205, What's New Beelzebub, will be
3329160	3334800	coming out on GameTap and PC, and I guess Civil War Mysteries as well.
3334800	3335800	Hey!
3335800	3336800	Sorry.
3336800	3339600	We make fun on this show.
3339600	3343520	And I think that's it, and there's, as we mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, Ikaruga
3343520	3346640	is rumored to be coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade.
3346640	3347640	Hopefully that's not broken.
3347640	3352080	And hopefully it isn't a shitty port, because that'll make me cry.
3352080	3355560	Where is my radiant silver gun?
3355560	3357280	Questions or comments from chat room.
3357280	3361360	Qualtippo says, the furry game would be rated D for drama, because I guess there's a lot
3361360	3362720	of drama in the furry scene.
3362720	3363720	I would know.
3363720	3364720	Really?
3364720	3365720	You're kidding.
3365720	3372200	Let's see, Katamari's Forever in chat says, I heard about that, speaking of Arcana Heart.
3372200	3374580	Eleven girl fighters, girl on girl action.
3374580	3377160	They have a dog girl in there.
3377160	3380200	I swear to God, it's a chick that's dog.
3380200	3382320	Is that like a manbear pig?
3382320	3383320	This has been done before.
3383320	3388360	It was called the Asuka 120% series.
3388360	3389880	So it's not manbear pig.
3389880	3391920	So this is nothing original, people.
3391920	3392920	I didn't know this.
3392920	3395440	Rama says cosplayers hate furries.
3395440	3403000	I didn't know there was this war between cosplayers and furries.
3403000	3405080	Dude, that should be a fighting game.
3405080	3408320	I guess one kind of drama hates the other kind of drama.
3408320	3409480	Cosplayers versus furries.
3409480	3410480	I would buy that.
3410480	3412480	I'm like, I'm just versus ninja.
3412480	3413480	Exactly.
3413480	3414480	Oh yeah?
3414480	3415480	Cowboys.
3415480	3420200	And SSG100 Matt says, no, no, no.
3420200	3421640	Everyone hates furries.
3421640	3423960	Aw, poor furries.
3423960	3425120	Not poor furries.
3425120	3428760	They're completely cognizant of what they're doing.
3428760	3429760	Dude I would love.
3429760	3432600	Okay, so what are the ideas for games we've had?
3432600	3434320	We've had laser cats.
3434320	3436640	We've had, what else do we have on a previous show?
3436640	3438280	We need to write these things down.
3438280	3439280	You do.
3439280	3440280	Put them on the wiki or something.
3440280	3441280	Something?
3441280	3442280	Damn it.
3442280	3443280	Someone had chatters?
3443280	3445120	Wasn't there something they had to do with paper?
3445120	3449320	Yeah, it was one of those games, because there was a game for DS coming out that you could
3449320	3450320	just play on paper.
3450320	3453040	Like it was like Pictionary or something on the DS.
3453040	3454640	I remember talking about that in the previous show.
3454640	3458200	It was something you could play with a pen and paper.
3458200	3460080	And now I want to add this to the list.
3460080	3461880	Cosplayers versus furries.
3461880	3463720	An epic fighting battle.
3463720	3464720	Bob's voice.
3464720	3465720	The game.
3465720	3466720	No, no.
3466720	3467720	Scratch that from the list.
3467720	3468720	That wouldn't sell.
3468720	3469720	L.O.L.
3469720	3474400	That was the name of the game.
3474400	3477160	There was a game on the DS called L.O.L. and it was something you could just play with
3477160	3479080	a fucking piece of paper and a pen.
3479080	3482960	The whole premise of that game was to get people to laugh or something like that and
3482960	3485920	they would vote on which drawing is the funniest or something like that.
3485920	3486920	That's it.
3486920	3488900	Yes, it's called pen and paper.
3488900	3490680	Can somebody please add that to the wiki?
3490680	3495680	Can our wiki gods like AJ Mix or Dark Tetsuya or somebody, can our wiki gods add like a
3495680	3497920	page of our great ideas?
3497920	3501280	And be sure to put on the bottom patent pending.
3501280	3502560	Awesome.
3502560	3504280	GameStop.com is down.
3504280	3505800	Hopefully that means that they've closed down.
3505800	3506800	They're like, we give up.
3506800	3508520	We have too much money.
3508520	3513880	Will they close down all the freaking pre-orders for cosplayers versus furries, shut them down?
3513880	3516480	It's like, oh my god, I can't handle this.
3516480	3517480	Anyways.
3517480	3521000	In fact, I would actually like to see some of our listeners go into a GameStop to pre-order
3521000	3527520	cosplayers versus furries because you know they'll take your $5 for anything and I'd
3527520	3528840	like to see what happens.
3528840	3533440	If it's not in the system, they can't do it because it prints up a receipt.
3533440	3535480	Damn it.
3535480	3541720	This is the extent of my knowledge from Dan managing a GameStop.
3541720	3543280	We should probably move on.
3543280	3544280	Can we?
3544280	3545280	Yes, please.
3545280	3546280	Yes.
3546280	3549000	So if that's it for the US releases.
3549000	3550520	I think it is at least.
3550520	3553680	How did release dates turn into cosplayers versus furries?
3553680	3554680	You did it.
3554680	3556320	That was your fault, Rob.
3556320	3557600	You know it.
3557600	3559040	It was an April Fool's joke.
3559040	3563360	You know it's actually not the first anymore.
3563360	3567020	Well I'm trying to transition into talking about some of the April Fool's Day pranks
3567020	3569760	from around the web and you know I gotta start with this.
3569760	3572960	This week we had so many April Fool's Day pranks because everyone gets in on it except
3572960	3574080	for Orange Launch Radio this year.
3574080	3577080	We didn't do an April Fool's Day prank because we had depressing news.
3577080	3579880	So the holiday was kind of ruined for us.
3579880	3584280	However, the IGN trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie.
3584280	3585640	What the fuck?
3585640	3588320	Somebody spent like thousands of dollars on it.
3588320	3589320	Did you see that trailer?
3589320	3590320	I did see that trailer.
3590320	3593480	Didn't it make you like want to like come?
3593480	3594480	Not at all.
3594480	3596000	It was actually pretty well done.
3596000	3597000	It was okay.
3597000	3600440	Some of it was hokey, but it looked like a sci-fi movie to me.
3600440	3604200	What do you expect from a sci-fi channel?
3604200	3607920	If they put a decent budget behind it and maybe had a good writer or something.
3607920	3612000	I didn't believe for a minute it was real because it didn't have a single star in it
3612000	3618440	and a movie like Zelda would at least have a star in it somewhere like Ian McKellen playing
3618440	3622480	the old man that says it's tough out there to go alone here take this or something but
3622480	3623640	he'd say it in his voice.
3623640	3624960	It's dangerous to go alone.
3624960	3625960	Thank you.
3625960	3626960	That's what it is.
3626960	3627960	It's dangerous.
3627960	3628960	Sean Connery.
3628960	3629960	It's dangerous to go alone.
3629960	3630960	It's dangerous.
3630960	3631960	No you can't so you should stop.
3631960	3634880	But there would be at least one famous person so that's why this thing couldn't be real
3634880	3639880	and the CGI was a little hokey but I thought it was pretty amazing the work that they did
3639880	3640880	do.
3640880	3642160	For an April Fool's joke it was awesome.
3642160	3647080	Yeah they put a lot of effort into it for an April Fool's joke but I wouldn't.
3647080	3648920	Did you see the making of trailer?
3648920	3652160	Because they did that shit in July of last year.
3652160	3654840	They did a making of trailer of a trailer.
3654840	3661640	Well they had a making of little snippet thing that was released the day after that shows
3661640	3662880	you how they did it.
3662880	3668440	No I didn't check like, oh it's April 2nd time to check and see if there's something
3668440	3669520	following up.
3669520	3670520	Is this better?
3670520	3671520	Yeah.
3671520	3672520	The date was July.
3672520	3673520	They did that in July.
3673520	3676320	That's the only thing I cared about in there was when did they do it because I wanted to
3676320	3681160	hear them say why they did it but it was July when they were putting it all together.
3681160	3683600	I was just kind of surprised at that.
3683600	3685120	Well good job.
3685120	3688800	But Loki I noticed there was no Tingle in the movie so there's still hope.
3688800	3693520	No I don't think that there was Tingle in the first game either so.
3693520	3694920	That's alright they can work it in.
3694920	3695920	No they can't.
3695920	3696920	Yeah they can.
3696920	3699920	Well they can't but I'm not playing him.
3699920	3702160	Oh moving on.
3702160	3704360	Yes the legend of me.
3704360	3705360	The legend of me?
3705360	3706360	The legend of me.
3706360	3711720	Other April Fool's jokes from around the web, Microsoft actually put together their own
3711720	3714860	little thing like they were announcing all these devices that were going to come out
3714860	3720440	such as the retro Xbox 360 that had a wood finish on it and the retro controller and
3720440	3721520	I thought the hilarious part.
3721520	3725160	I like how Microsoft can kind of make fun of themselves because the retro controller
3725160	3726880	had like a hundred buttons on it.
3726880	3727880	It looked like a typewriter.
3727880	3728880	It was kind of funny.
3728880	3733880	And then they announced like a virtual headset and my favorite was Xbox Live the board game.
3733880	3735360	That was pretty good.
3735360	3736480	Oh God.
3736480	3737480	What else did we have?
3737480	3744320	Kotaku did cake kaku for a day or something like not bukkake but cake kaku or something
3744320	3747160	like that for a whole day where they were nothing but gaming cakes which was actually
3747160	3750480	kind of funny because they do cover a lot of gaming cakes on that blog or at least they
3750480	3753540	did in the past year.
3753540	3754540	What else was there?
3754540	3758560	Somebody announced My Little Pony for Xbox Live Arcade.
3758560	3759560	That's awesome.
3759560	3760840	I heard someone said the EA was doing that.
3760840	3761840	That's awesome.
3761840	3762840	Oh don't forget Wow.
3762840	3763840	Oh yeah.
3763840	3765480	What did Blizzard do this year?
3765480	3768880	I know specifically for Wow they introduced the Bard class.
3768880	3769880	That looked hardcore.
3769880	3770880	That was good.
3770880	3772560	And they had Molten Core the console game.
3772560	3773560	For the Atari toy 600.
3773560	3778080	Well did you see how the Bard was supposed to have like guitar with you know like guitar
3778080	3779880	hero controls and stuff like that.
3779880	3783880	I was actually pretty pissed that that was fake because I think the control scheme would
3783880	3787920	be stupid but I would like to see Bards in World of Warcraft because Bards are awesome.
3787920	3791400	They had for Starcraft 2 they had Tauren Marines.
3791400	3792400	Oh yeah.
3792400	3793400	Nice.
3793400	3794400	They were beefy.
3794400	3796400	I also like the Guild Wars thing.
3796400	3797400	I thought that was cool.
3797400	3800880	And Lord of the Rings Online had like giant chickens that you had to fight.
3800880	3802880	But nobody cares because it's Lord of the Rings Online.
3802880	3807480	And actually speaking of Guild Wars, the Guild Wars wiki and the WoW wiki switched places
3807480	3808480	for a day.
3808480	3811720	So you tried to go to WoW wiki and it was giving you Guild War quests.
3811720	3812720	That's awesome.
3812720	3813720	That's great.
3813720	3814720	And then vice versa.
3814720	3815720	Brilliant.
3815720	3820880	And then there was also the Konami Ubisoft one where they had Altera and Metal Gear Solid
3820880	3827480	4 and they did like an actual video from in-game and stuff with all that going on.
3827480	3829040	And what other ones?
3829040	3830040	Oh.
3830040	3831480	Dark Tetsuya says Shang Long and Street Fighter IV.
3831480	3834480	I was just going to say that.
3834480	3836480	That was funny.
3836480	3837480	I don't know.
3837480	3843840	Oh, Bungie did one where they were showing the Xbox Halo 3 stats, you know how like show
3843840	3848640	a little light or whatever where people are playing Halo 3 and apparently it made their
3848640	3851560	little cartoon Halo head thing on there.
3851560	3856560	So I was kind of kind of dumb but I think what else there was.
3856560	3858080	Creativity from around the web.
3858080	3859080	Yeah.
3859080	3861080	What was your favorite prank out of all of them?
3861080	3862080	I like the Zelda thing.
3862080	3864600	I think the Zelda trailer kind of trumped everything.
3864600	3870040	I mean even though it wasn't like I wasn't going to fall for it, it's still like the
3870040	3871600	quality of it was very good.
3871600	3873880	I think everybody has their guard up on April 1st.
3873880	3875360	It would be very hard to fall for a prank.
3875360	3876880	Did anyone fall for a prank?
3876880	3879640	Chatters, did any of you fall for a prank?
3879640	3882840	I know some of our listeners fell for that Zelda thing because we got some emails about
3882840	3883840	it.
3883840	3885800	I got my boss to fall for a prank.
3885800	3887120	What was that?
3887120	3891400	My review, my work review was on April 1st.
3891400	3892440	Nice.
3892440	3896640	And so I was thinking that there was going to be all this stuff but I went in and I was
3896640	3901360	like well before we start the meeting I have to tell you something really, really important
3901360	3902960	and this is bad news for you.
3902960	3907000	It's really good news for me but I've been offered a job at the Beau Ravage in Biloxi,
3907000	3911640	Mississippi as their massage therapist for some sort of reopening thing so I'm going
3911640	3916760	to be moving in three weeks and I did it completely deadpan and she just got quiet and looked
3916760	3921840	at me and said I'm happy for you and I was like well thank you and also I just completely
3921840	3924400	fooled you.
3924400	3926000	This is at my annual review.
3926000	3927000	Nice.
3927000	3930840	But she said that they all got her by, she calls in to check on us every morning and
3930840	3933760	that they said that nobody else showed up.
3933760	3939960	The only April Fools prank I played is I went to our guild forum for WoW.
3939960	3944320	I went to the guild forum and I posted a post that says why I quit the guild last night
3944320	3950320	to go back to Final Fantasy XI and then you open it up and it says yeah right April Fools.
3950320	3951320	That's clever Rob.
3951320	3952320	I know it was great.
3952320	3955560	And the worst part is some of us actually believe you.
3955560	3956560	I know, I know.
3956560	3958640	What about all the Rick Rolling stuff that was going on?
3958640	3959640	Oh God.
3959640	3961240	Rick Rolling is so old.
3961240	3968080	However, however, there was a clever one that was linked to me of The Muppets.
3968080	3971040	I was a beaker and that was cool.
3971040	3979520	The best Rick Roll was not beaker but in a second it was not game facts which was evil
3979520	3985800	but it was actually Chris Perillo of Locker Gnome from the Screen Savers announcing his
3985800	3991800	last video podcast because apparently he had a fight with his woman.
3991800	3992800	Right.
3992800	3993800	His woman.
3993800	3994800	It's always the woman.
3994800	3998720	Yeah, he just, I'm sorry, I just, he looks away, freeze frame, never going to give you
3998720	3999720	up, starts playing.
3999720	4000720	I'm like oh God.
4000720	4006320	I think my favorite April Fools joke other than the Zelda thing had to have been, and
4006320	4011720	I know it was a little late for April Fools but the release of Mr. Driller in there online,
4011720	4013720	it's so funny because it doesn't work.
4013720	4019400	He's fooled all those people because it's Mr. Driller online and the online portion
4019400	4021000	doesn't work.
4021000	4025960	You remember Mo who was here a few weeks ago who did a cover of Still Alive, remember that?
4025960	4031080	She actually has a cover of Never Going to Give You Up on YouTube and that's how we found
4031080	4032080	her actually.
4032080	4036800	That's how Jake found her to begin with and they call it Chick Rolling if you want to
4036800	4037800	link that YouTube.
4037800	4038800	Wow.
4038800	4039800	So there it is.
4039800	4040960	I'm not making that up.
4040960	4043320	There's a cover of her doing Never Going to Give You Up.
4043320	4044320	It's quite good.
4044320	4049000	See, April Fools, I guess it's about fooling people obviously and yeah, the Zelda thing
4049000	4054160	was pretty good but I kind of like things that make me laugh on April Fools Day and
4054160	4058840	definitely the Molten Core console thing just made me crack up.
4058840	4061560	Blizzard does good jobs every year with April Fools.
4061560	4062880	They do good jobs.
4062880	4065280	Let's move on with news because we want to wrap this segment up.
4065280	4068640	Well, I have our downloadable content stuff.
4068640	4069640	Yay stuff.
4069640	4078200	Xbox Live Arcade, Mr. Driller Online, 800, Microsoft Points, Xbox Live Marketplace, Army
4078200	4082480	of Two, Football Manager 2008 and this is UK, sorry.
4082480	4084880	Some of it's over here.
4084880	4090840	For game content, Call of Duty 4, Brighty Map Pack, Two Worlds Curse of Souls, Pinball
4090840	4092920	FX, Rocky and Bullwinkle Table.
4092920	4093920	Guess what?
4093920	4095400	I owned one for reals.
4095400	4101520	So haha, that's how I got my World Cup soccer.
4101520	4107520	A whole bunch of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol stuff, who cares?
4107520	4109320	I got to get that game.
4109320	4115600	Themes, Mr. Driller Online, FIFA Street 3, Brazil, England, France, Italy, Germany, Mexico,
4115600	4118120	Spain, USA, Australia.
4118120	4124040	Pictures, Major League Gaming Got Frag, Major League Gaming Game Battles, Turok Creatures,
4124040	4129480	Turok Whiskey Company, Wolf Pack, Variety, Mr. Driller Online, more shit, Call of Duty
4129480	4139520	4, Nick Busby, Ink Blots number 2, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Elite Pack, PSN, nothing.
4139520	4142360	Virtual Console in Europe, Yoshi's Cookie.
4142360	4148240	In the US we got Cruisin' and we got Wonder Boy, which we've talked about for the Metaboli
4148240	4160480	thing, there's Imprenium Romanum, Buku Dominoes and Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Sins of a Solar
4160480	4163440	Empire PC demo is out, so there you go.
4163440	4167440	Here's the hilarious thing about the Mr. Driller Online theme, is that when you would download
4167440	4172200	it on Xbox 360, what the theme is, is just a bunch of red X's.
4172200	4178520	Anyhow, let's move on.
4178520	4183800	Let's see, I was going to say also, yeah, PlayStation Network's not going to have much
4183800	4187720	for the next few weeks anyway since they're revamping their store and in the meantime
4187720	4192760	not putting anything up there, so if you want your free still live like you get in Xbox
4192760	4197100	360, you're going to have to wait until the 17th, so that sucks.
4197100	4200520	Another game though that you're going to have to wait even longer for is The Force Unleashed,
4200520	4204960	which was originally going to be a July game, but now it's been pushed all the way to September
4204960	4208160	16th, where it's hopefully going to stay.
4208160	4214760	This week though they had some videos showing off the different versions of the game, which
4214760	4218440	I guess each game is kind of getting their own exclusive things, like for example the
4218440	4225240	PlayStation 2 and PSP titles will be getting some exclusive story lines and stuff like
4225240	4229200	that in the game in the 360 and PS3 versions.
4229200	4234840	You of course get kick-ass graphics and physics, and then the Wii version they actually have
4234840	4242920	a battle mode where you can fight different people and also like, you know, Wiimote, lightsaber
4242920	4248600	combat and stuff like that, and I believe also the PSP version has some like legacy
4248600	4252880	story line modes that you can play through five different story lines through the six
4252880	4257080	episodes of the movie, so that's kind of neat.
4257080	4261160	Looks like a pretty awesome game, and like I said, September 16th is when we can see
4261160	4265160	that in the US.
4265160	4269560	Alright.
4269560	4271040	Are you excited about The Force Unleashed?
4271040	4272040	I actually am.
4272040	4274520	I'm thinking about picking that up for the 360.
4274520	4276240	Star Wars games are usually pretty good.
4276240	4278220	I like Lego Star Wars.
4278220	4281280	So go figure, we have people trying to connect to life 365 right now and it's not letting
4281280	4282280	them in.
4282280	4285160	I'm not going to miss this place at all.
4285160	4290840	The more I think about it, we should have done this a year ago, all right, Rooster Teeth.
4290840	4294720	You might not know that name, but you definitely know Red vs. Blue, something that they've
4294720	4299460	put together for years and years, but you know, they obviously, right, well now they're
4299460	4302180	going to do something called Reconstruction.
4302180	4306140	They put out a trailer, a little teaser video that's available on YouTube if you search
4306140	4309560	for Reconstruction Rooster Teeth, you'll find it.
4309560	4313560	What I find interesting about it though, it's a little bit more serious, at least the trailer
4313560	4317320	had a more serious tone, so I guess they're getting away from the funny stuff and maybe
4317320	4318520	doing something a little more serious.
4318520	4319880	I don't know about that.
4319880	4322760	I mean, every series that they've done has been funny.
4322760	4323760	I guess that's true.
4323760	4327240	I mean, maybe, I don't know, but it would be interesting if they took the different
4327240	4328240	direction.
4328240	4329240	It would be interesting.
4329240	4334400	Maybe it'll be a dramedy, like Ally McBeal was drama but funny, well to some.
4334400	4336200	Yeah, that's debatable.
4336200	4339240	I never really found it funny.
4339240	4340240	Neither did anybody else.
4340240	4341240	I never watched it.
4341240	4342240	Oh, snap.
4342240	4344760	She was too skeleton-like.
4344760	4347400	Yeah, that's every time I look at it.
4347400	4349640	All right, no more TV critic.
4349640	4350640	Back to gaming news.
4350640	4355560	Remember when we were talking about the contest for Puzzle Quest, the add-on getting a name?
4355560	4356560	No.
4356560	4357560	Just kidding.
4357560	4358560	Yes, I do.
4358560	4359560	Rob.
4359560	4360560	What?
4360560	4363160	Is that the name of the new expansion?
4363160	4364360	Yes, that's the name.
4364360	4366360	Try to spell it.
4366360	4370760	Anyway, they got 500-plus suggestions and-
4370760	4372640	That's it, that's actually kind of sad.
4372640	4373640	Only 500.
4373640	4374640	I know, right?
4374640	4377320	And in the end, they got Revenge of the Plague Lord.
4377320	4382200	Oh, and I was hoping they would pick Puzzle Quest 1.5 to search for more money.
4382200	4383600	Did you submit that?
4383600	4385640	No, that's Spaceballs 2.
4385640	4387680	Ah, yes.
4387680	4389400	That's actually kind of a dumb title.
4389400	4390400	I don't know.
4390400	4392680	It doesn't make me go OMG1.
4392680	4399400	The runners-up was sorceress of Malbec and the scourge of Antharg.
4399400	4400920	Those are much cooler names, because they have-
4400920	4403800	I think I knew an ogre in a D&D game named Antharg.
4403800	4408680	It's like they threw the alphabet into Will It Blend, and they got those names.
4408680	4411080	Did you actually watch them for that?
4411080	4413280	The sorceress of Elbec, what was that?
4413280	4414280	Malbec.
4414280	4415280	Malbec and the-
4415280	4416280	And the scourge of Antharg.
4416280	4417280	Antharg.
4417280	4419060	Did you actually watch any of those yet?
4419060	4420240	Will It Blend is pretty good, yes.
4420240	4422560	I watched the one where they blended a Guitar Hero controller.
4422560	4425760	I liked the one where they blended the iPhone.
4425760	4426760	Pretty awesome.
4426760	4431600	I heard they dispose of a hobo in that.
4431600	4438200	April Fools, just kidding.
4438200	4444440	Well there's a game that is on Xbox Live Arcade that everybody loves.
4444440	4447360	And well, they're going to be loving the sequel too.
4447360	4450480	It's Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2.
4450480	4456060	And it is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, at least that's where we would assume it's going.
4456060	4462240	And this comes to us from the Australian Classifications Board, the OFLC, which has just raided the
4462240	4463240	game.
4463240	4471200	So, you know, kind of like the MPA, not the MPAA, but the ESRB here, you know, that is
4471200	4472660	kind of their version of that.
4472660	4477760	So I'm sure, you know, we'll see this at some point, maybe an E3 announcement or something
4477760	4478760	like that.
4478760	4481840	Well when it got spoiled now though, that's got to suck.
4481840	4482840	Eh, whatever.
4482840	4485520	At least it's not like Sonic Unleashed.
4485520	4491080	Yeah, that sucks for those guys.
4491080	4492640	What do you think they're going to change in this game though?
4492640	4496960	I kind of like the Wii version, the Wii version was good, I mean that would be a pretty kick-ass
4496960	4500680	download game, but I mean, then again, it's the game that's on the Wii, so I don't think
4500680	4502160	they could do the same thing.
4502160	4506280	But like, I didn't know there was a lot else they could do to Geometry Wars, but that Wii
4506280	4507280	game was pretty awesome.
4507280	4510840	Add some new enemies maybe, or something like that, different weapons.
4510840	4511840	I guess.
4511840	4516320	Maybe they'll have like co-op or competitive mode or something, that would be a big change,
4516320	4519200	because they didn't have that in the first one.
4519200	4521240	So we'll see.
4521240	4529680	Well we're going to play this song, and long time listeners of our show recognize that
4529680	4536320	song as Happy Wedding, which is going to introduce a new segment in the show this week called
4536320	4539200	Nerds Got Married.
4539200	4541960	Whenever there's a wedding of note that we want to highlight on the show, we're going
4541960	4543680	to say Nerds Got Married.
4543680	4549600	So this week in Nerds Got Married, a listener of Orange Lounge Radio actually got married.
4549600	4552360	The Viva Pinata guy, remember the Viva Pinata guy?
4552360	4556160	He's actually a listener of the program, he commented on our MySpace.
4556160	4558960	I think he was mad because we were poking fun at the story, even though that's what
4558960	4559960	we do here.
4559960	4565440	But the Viva Pinata guy got married.
4565440	4570480	You might remember in Viva Pinata, he did the diamond sending thing and did a little
4570480	4577440	note in the game, and they had the wedding, and they did it on a cruise ship, and they
4577440	4582120	actually had little Viva Pinata creatures on their wedding cake.
4582120	4587160	So congratulations to David and Jen, if you want to see more about the wedding.
4587160	4600560	It's all on David's YouTube channel, which is available at Gears Cast.
4600560	4603600	He must also be a big Gears of War player.
4603600	4605600	So there you have it, Nerds Got Married.
4605600	4606600	Congratulations.
4606600	4612560	I know that song has to do with weddings and stuff, but do you have to use such a shitty
4612560	4613560	song?
4613560	4614960	I hate that song.
4614960	4617280	I like to do little throwbacks to our days.
4617280	4618280	It's a Bimani station.
4618280	4619560	Could you do a better throwback?
4619560	4620960	I could throw you out of here.
4620960	4622920	I could throw my fist in your face.
4622920	4623920	Alright.
4623920	4625240	Just thought I'd interject there.
4625240	4626240	Alright, how about this?
4626240	4629040	I will allow Dark Soccer to do a proper throwback.
4629040	4630040	Thank you.
4630040	4635480	And she will throwback by highlighting a classic game of the week.
4635480	4640960	It also hurts my heart because this is classic now.
4640960	4644080	So Dark Soccer, what did you pick for the kids this week as your classic game of the
4644080	4645080	week?
4645080	4646080	Something they must check out?
4646080	4648120	I picked Pure Awesomeness.
4648120	4653600	I picked Crazy Taxi on Dreamcast.
4653600	4654600	Awesome.
4654600	4655600	Yeah.
4655600	4658920	This is the best, like one of the best games ever.
4658920	4663800	Hey, it's time to make some crazy money, are you ready?
4663800	4667520	Here we go!
4667520	4669040	That's not the same song I remember.
4669040	4673320	No, well, it had Bad Religion and Office of the Dead.
4673320	4681600	But yeah, it's basically, not only is it a clever type of beat the clock sort of driving
4681600	4682600	game.
4682600	4690040	You can do different kinds of stunts in there to increase your fare, you have to play for
4690040	4691040	a better rating.
4691040	4696880	I remember playing in the arcade until I got an S-Class license and I was so freaking happy.
4696880	4705000	The game also is a clever advertising technique for Pizza Hut, Fila, Tower Records, which
4705000	4709380	actually I guess it wasn't so clever for Tower Records, Levi's store, and Kentucky Fried
4709380	4710380	Chicken.
4710380	4714800	They all had massive product placement in that game.
4714800	4720920	But you had four different drivers, you had your balance driver, you had your fast one,
4720920	4726960	you've got your best control, and then you had your heavy cabs that can basically run
4726960	4728960	over anything in its path.
4728960	4733960	And you had a whole city set up that you could drive through and get in place, and jump out
4733960	4736960	the buildings and do different things like that.
4736960	4742960	And on top of that, as you can probably hear as I mentioned in the soundtrack, it had the
4742960	4747960	songs from Bad Religion and Office of the Dead had interlock at 10 and 20 10, then the
4747960	4770960	last song on the radio and not think of this game.
4770960	4774080	I love this game, I actually think this is one of the better driving games.
4774080	4778480	I'm not so fond of it on the Dreamcast as I am in the arcades, like for me that's the
4778480	4781960	home for this game, it was an arcade game, although I will give props to the Dreamcast
4781960	4785160	version because it had the missions and it had the extra stuff in it.
4785160	4786160	The missions were hard though.
4786160	4792880	The missions were actually pretty cool, if I'm just going to bring that up, it trains
4792880	4796680	you to do different stuff in the game is what the missions are there for, so showing you
4796680	4804200	how to do dashes and how to toby and crazy stuff, I actually thought the later ones that
4804200	4809080	had so many interesting ones, like the super long jump and everything, that was kind of
4809080	4810080	cool.
4810080	4812080	But this is one of my favorite games ever.
4812080	4814360	Irene, were you a fan of Crazy Taxi?
4814360	4815360	I never played it.
4815360	4816360	Really?
4816360	4817360	Really.
4817360	4818360	It's a really fun game actually.
4818360	4819360	I should try.
4819360	4823400	For a driving game it's a lot, it's just different, it's not just NASCAR vroom vroom vroom around
4823400	4824400	in a circle, it's pretty fun.
4824400	4826840	You raise the clock and get crazy money.
4826840	4830720	Take people to Pizza Hut, how could you not like that?
4830720	4832280	Yeah, I'll have to try it sometime.
4832280	4836040	It's actually available on GameTap too, I know I hoard that a lot, but hey, they got
4836040	4837040	free games on there.
4837040	4838040	Well, not free, I guess free.
4838040	4841760	I did like on the later ones though, I did like on the later ones how they had it where
4841760	4846840	you could play, where you could have multiple people in your car too and do different deliveries
4846840	4848260	to different places.
4848260	4852680	Rasteel UT says, funny that Pizza Hut isn't Pizza Hut anymore, they're Pasta Hut now.
4852680	4855320	Did they have to change that in later games or something maybe?
4855320	4856800	Oh, in the game?
4856800	4857800	I don't know.
4857800	4858800	Maybe.
4858800	4859800	Wasn't that an April Fools joke?
4859800	4860800	Yeah.
4860800	4861800	Oh, perhaps.
4861800	4864040	No, they're Wing Street now or whatever.
4864040	4870640	Yeah, Tiger Claw mentions in the game you can't run over people sadly, any attempt they
4870640	4871640	always run out of the way.
4871640	4872640	Well, yeah.
4872640	4873880	But it was sure fun trying.
4873880	4875880	I'm talking about running into cars.
4875880	4876880	Yeah.
4876880	4879680	You can run into the cars.
4879680	4880680	I love Crazy Taxi.
4880680	4881680	I know, me too.
4881680	4883680	I want to make some crazy money, Rob.
4883680	4884680	All right.
4884680	4886160	Well, I got a dollar.
4886160	4888440	I owe you a dollar.
4888440	4889440	You should just keep it.
4889440	4890440	All right.
4890440	4895680	Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of our podcast, but there's plenty more to come
4895680	4898240	for this, our last week on Live 365.
4898240	4903120	Coming up in part B, we're going to play a game that we started here on Live 365.
4903120	4908040	Actually, this game dates all the way back to a show I did on college radio, so this
4908040	4910360	game has survived for 10 years.
4910360	4913520	We're going to play it one last time... Well, not last time, but one more time tonight here
4913520	4916240	on Live 365, and then we'll bring it over to All Games in a few weeks.
4916240	4918960	We're going to play Listless tonight.
4918960	4922600	The topic for tonight's Listless, so folks can start thinking about what they want to
4922600	4928440	do here in studio, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
4928440	4929440	Oh, God.
4929440	4935520	This is the topic of tonight's Listless, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.
4935520	4940200	You guys think about that, and we will cover that in part B of our podcast.
4940200	4942560	But until then, a break.
4942560	4943560	See you then.
4943560	4948200	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice
4948200	4949200	a week.
4949200	4975720	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
