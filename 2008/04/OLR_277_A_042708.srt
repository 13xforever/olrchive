1
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:25,347
[SPEAKER_07]: The Old Classic Games Splatterhouse is set to return, Burnout Paradise is getting patched for motorcycle riding, and are arcade ticket redemption machines a form of illegal gambling?

2
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:37,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of the program that Bobby Blackwolf had to censor three times tonight.

3
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:44,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio, live at www.allgames.com every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

4
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:50,165
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:53,467
[SPEAKER_08]: My BFF in the world, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

6
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

7
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:54,708
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

8
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm tired.

9
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:56,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Tired?

10
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the sun.

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Tired cat is very tired?

12
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:00,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Sleepy Jamie is sleepy.

13
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:24,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my lord.

14
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:24,617
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's 90.

15
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:25,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

16
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:27,339
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 83 last time I checked.

17
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was going to say, when we get into June and July, we're going to have 105, and I'm going to cry.

18
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the forecast says that it's going to be 83 on Monday, and then in the 70s, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

19
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh.

20
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you for the weather update.

21
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,873
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people talk about the weather when there's nothing better to talk about.

22
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,195
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have video games and other things to talk about.

23
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Tech Master Loki, my other BFF.

24
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:51,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how you doing?

25
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:55,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a large soda today because it's hot.

26
00:02:13,365 --> 00:02:14,506
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura Talks About Her Gaming Week

27
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:44,187
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I get when I don't hit the stop button.

28
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:45,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Happens a lot here on the show.

29
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:02,904
[SPEAKER_03]: So that I can play Seiken Densetsu 3.

30
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:11,109
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dan was supposed to bring me back Mario Kart tonight, but I'm sort of like meh about it because we've already had access to the game for like a week.

31
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of meh.

32
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:17,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Although lately, I really, really want to play Street Fighter Alpha 2.

33
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,300
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

35
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:54,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of classic gaming in your future.

36
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, exciting stuff.

37
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move over to Loki and see if there's been a lot of classic gaming in his week.

38
00:04:00,884 --> 00:04:03,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I played a classic game called Saints Row.

39
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:06,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it's not really that classic anymore.

40
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:08,965
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

41
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:14,849
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're still... Actually, we downloaded a new map this week because we're bored with the three that they have.

42
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,390
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted the fourth one.

43
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,251
[SPEAKER_06]: The fourth one's okay.

44
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,532
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been out for, what, years now.

45
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:25,616
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, with the internet being blocked at our work, I had to kind of jerry-rig something in order to get to work.

46
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was all to just kill time until Grand Theft Auto 4, which I sneaked a early copy of.

47
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:36,263
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

48
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:39,536
[SPEAKER_06]: What more do I need to see?

49
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:43,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been looking for this game for, what, years now?

50
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:46,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Since the release of Grand Theft Auto 3?

51
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably since the last Grand Theft Auto.

52
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:49,682
[SPEAKER_06]: San Andreas, yeah.

53
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:50,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking awesome.

54
00:04:52,046 --> 00:05:19,119
[SPEAKER_06]: it's um they're okay let me just since the game is you know pretty awesome I'll just you know mention my gripes of the game I don't like the soundtrack I think it's lame um I guess I've been spoiled with like Vice City and Grand Theft Auto 3 but I hate the radio stations in uh 4 I think they're crap um let's see I don't like um I don't know it might be just it um

55
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,154
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

56
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:50,127
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple questions.

57
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:52,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the game worthy of the perfect 10 reviews it's receiving left and right?

58
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

59
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:58,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not perfect, but it's damn good.

60
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:02,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say give it a 9.8 or 9.9, but nothing's perfect.

61
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:06,714
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the most obscene thing you've done in the game so far?

62
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,974
[SPEAKER_06]: The most obscene thing?

63
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:12,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, thing that is going to shock people like hot coffee.

64
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:15,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Thing that is going to make Lord Voldemort...

65
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:16,702
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, well, other than the countless people that I've been running over in my car.

67
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:47,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say it's a lot more realistic, so, like, you can shoot someone in the leg and they start hobbling away and stuff.

68
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:56,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, oh, I went to the strip club in there, and they have, like, you know, pretty explicit lap dances.

69
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:59,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, no one's actually naked in there, but, you know, pasties or whatever.

70
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,730
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty explicit.

71
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can do three different lap dances as it goes on there.

72
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:11,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them has two girls making out on top of you.

73
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,553
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess that's pretty explicit.

74
00:07:13,273 --> 00:07:16,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a girlfriend you get in the game in the very beginning there.

75
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:20,915
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can go in for hot coffee, I guess, but it doesn't show anything.

76
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:23,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And she actually screams the weirdest things.

77
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:24,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, do they actually call it hot coffee?

78
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:25,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

79
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:25,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

80
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:30,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you get the achievement for that for warm coffee, which is funny.

81
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:45,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see in the video review from IGN, there was a scene, I'm assuming from a hooker you can pick up, but it showed a hooker in your lap bouncing up and down on you in a car, so that's pretty explicit, I guess.

82
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:48,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But nothing super over the top yet.

83
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

84
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

85
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

86
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:29,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a percentage of how much they like you, and that'll go down if you don't do their missions.

87
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,701
[SPEAKER_08]: So the game doesn't let you just do the open sandbox thing?

88
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:35,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Because one thing I loved about Grand Theft Auto was just like, you know, I didn't even have to pay attention to the story.

89
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:36,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

90
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:37,426
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do the open sandbox thing.

91
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:46,875
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a mode on the phone that turned it into sleep mode, and that'll turn all the in-game story stuff off, and then you just go and do whatever.

92
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:48,255
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

93
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:52,136
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so pretty much just the radio.

94
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:54,577
[SPEAKER_06]: The stations are kind of retarded on there.

95
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,378
[SPEAKER_06]: You can watch TV, which is kind of funny.

96
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,918
[SPEAKER_06]: You have fake TV shows on there.

97
00:08:58,118 --> 00:08:58,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

98
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:02,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know.

99
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,860
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it for right now.

100
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:29,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com We always invite our listeners to come join us live and participate in our program We read chat comments, take emails and phone calls later on in the show First comment tonight from Sephiroth1215 After reading the soundtrack on wiki, the Grand Theft Auto 4 soundtrack does look like it sucks Too bad, because I love the San Andreas one But, hey, I guess, you know, the best thing about it is Since it is on the PlayStation 3 and 360 custom soundtracks, so

101
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:50,275
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier Loki said there's no such thing as a perfect game J-Rod says Silent Hill 1 is perfect to me anyway well yeah maybe to one person and you know be honest this is it's the perfect Grand Theft Auto I think for me and I haven't even delved into like a lot of online stuff yet because you know you can do custom soundtracks so you can fix your major gripe right there

102
00:09:50,875 --> 00:10:01,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't like it because in 3 it had some pretty cool stuff like they had a station that was all electro music and that kind of thing and that was really cool and in Vice City all the stations were awesome there.

103
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:10,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just there's a lot of music that I've never heard of in there and I guess it's kind of cool that it's new and exclusive to the game but at the same time I haven't heard of it and I don't really care for it.

104
00:10:11,337 --> 00:10:14,419
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw wants to know if you've explored the comedy club area of the game.

105
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,080
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't gotten to a comedy club.

106
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,183
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I've gotten to right now is like a cabaret club, and that sucks.

107
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:22,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Cabaret is shit.

108
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:24,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they have a burlesque show?

109
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,245
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty awesome.

110
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they have a burlesque show.

111
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,828
[SPEAKER_06]: The one time I went in there, they had this really crappy magician.

112
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:36,092
[SPEAKER_06]: The second time I went in there, they had some guy rolling around on the stage with doing some sort of western thing.

113
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:37,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Western monologue.

114
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:37,893
[SPEAKER_06]: You can...

115
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:45,398
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first dates you go on is bowling, so you can go bowl, which is kind of cool.

116
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:51,022
[SPEAKER_06]: They have darts, you can do billiards, they've got... Dance Dance Revolution?

117
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:55,365
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a game that's like, I think it's supposed to be like Q-Bert in there.

118
00:10:57,627 --> 00:10:57,907
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

119
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta go for another viewpoint.

120
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,272
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, any interest in Grand Theft Auto 4 at all?

121
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:04,732
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

122
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:05,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

123
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:07,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like those games.

124
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:08,275
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not fun to me.

125
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:12,032
[SPEAKER_08]: is it not fun because there's no point?

126
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:16,141
[SPEAKER_08]: they're kind of boring senseless violence not your thing?

127
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:18,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I like senseless violence I just think they're boring

128
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:21,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with Loki.

129
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:37,296
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to open up the cheat codes because the best part of Grand Theft Auto, at least the last one, or I think it was Vice City I was playing that had this, there was the code that would just make the cars appear from the heavens and you could just make like 80 cars pile up and then fire a rocket at them and just make the biggest explosions in the world.

130
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,657
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my favorite part because fire is awesome.

131
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:42,285
[SPEAKER_08]: MyGamingWeek.com

132
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:03,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty graphics, fun to play.

133
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Loading times surprised me a little bit.

134
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's just because my PSP is old and maybe I need to get a mini.

135
00:12:09,408 --> 00:12:13,629
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, the loading times kind of surprised me how slow they are in some points.

136
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,429
[SPEAKER_08]: But it didn't really detract from the experience.

137
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,970
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that I noticed it, which says something there.

138
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,210
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other game I've actually been playing a lot more of is Patapon.

139
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought that game.

140
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really was not what I thought it was going to be.

141
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:28,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I expected it to be like a straight-up music game.

142
00:12:28,872 --> 00:12:33,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly music is one element of it, but it was more of like a strategy type of game.

143
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:34,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to say it.

144
00:12:34,174 --> 00:12:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a, you know, like basically here's the gist of the game for those who haven't played it is that, you know, the screen flashes in rhythm.

145
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:43,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you'll hear a drum beat that goes do, do, do.

146
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:47,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you hit the drums, which are the buttons on the PSP.

147
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: You only get two drums to start, but you get more later on.

148
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:54,025
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hit the drums to issue commands to your little army.

149
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:57,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So you might go, and that makes them move forward.

150
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you might go, and that makes them attack the enemy.

151
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:06,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So not only are you having to think about the music, but you're having to think about, okay, what do I want to have them do next?

152
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:07,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I want to have them march forward?

153
00:13:07,696 --> 00:13:08,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I want to have them attack?

154
00:13:08,617 --> 00:13:09,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I want to have them retreat?

155
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:11,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I want to have them defend?

156
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:12,040
[SPEAKER_08]: What do I want to have them do?

157
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was kind of interesting.

158
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:14,722
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

159
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:20,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you what, the tutorial in the game, not so great, because it took me forever to figure out what was going on.

160
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, why isn't my freaking army listening to me?

161
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And it took me like a minute to get the hang of the game.

162
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:28,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I needed it to kind of show me a little more.

163
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:32,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm just stupid or old or something, but it took me a little bit to get the hang of.

164
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,108
[SPEAKER_08]: But then once I got in it, okay.

165
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:39,571
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's kind of cool that you can slowly build your army up, and there's that whole strategy of making the new...

166
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:41,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

167
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:35,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I just never got the hang of it and it's just like too much for me because I don't play a lot of those types of board games and I don't have a lot of I think the easiest way to learn those types of games is to have friends that play them because I think friends teaching you how to play those games is much easier than the Xbox trying to teach you and so I had the hardest time trying to learn Catan because I didn't really play with anyone else that knew it and so I was thinking a lot of Lost Cities I'm probably not going to get it but the card game is actually pretty simplistic yet you know one of those games that has a lot of depth to it so I was kind of surprised um

168
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:44,298
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing is, I'm not sure, you know, when all's said and done, there's not a lot of difference between Lost Cities and Uno.

169
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:46,300
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both card games.

170
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,564
[SPEAKER_08]: They're both, you know, they have the camera support.

171
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:52,766
[SPEAKER_08]: They both are pretty quick to play.

172
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:56,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Granted, Lost Cities has a little more of strategy, but what is it?

173
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a virtual deck of cards, right?

174
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:04,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure why Sierra justifies the extra $5 and charges $10 for Lost Cities.

175
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's nothing else there.

176
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know what, unlockable art, woohoo.

177
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:11,745
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's not a lot to really justify that extra price.

178
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:16,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, if I was a brand new Xbox owner and I wanted a card game, I'd go for Uno first.

179
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,671
[SPEAKER_08]: But Lost Cities isn't bad, it's just...

180
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:20,628
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

181
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:44,234
[SPEAKER_08]: You're trying to make numerical sequences from 2 to 10 on 5 different colors, which represent cities.

182
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:50,418
[SPEAKER_08]: If you are going to start building on a color, you have to make a 20-point investment.

183
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:54,981
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to hope that you play enough cards that will add up to 20 or over by the time the deck is out.

184
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,823
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to those, there are these multiplier cards that you can play first.

185
00:15:58,843 --> 00:15:59,903
[SPEAKER_08]: They're called investment cards.

186
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:04,306
[SPEAKER_08]: You can double, triple, or quadruple the amount of points that you'll earn from

187
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:08,207
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're also quadrupling the amount of points that you sacrifice to open up the city.

188
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,828
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of interesting.

189
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:18,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Katamaris Forever says in chat, Except Uno is appealing to housewives and schoolchildren, and Lost Cities is for the uber-hardcore.

190
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,471
[SPEAKER_08]: That may be true, but it still doesn't justify the extra price to me.

191
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:23,132
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

192
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:23,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't seem like there's...

193
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:37,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft says Strip Uno on Xbox Live with a cam.

194
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you could play Strip Lost Cities too, I guess.

195
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:41,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure exactly what the rules for that would be.

196
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:44,180
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need a webcam and an Xbox to play Strip Uno.

197
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,921
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

198
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just have a bunch of people in the house and booze and then be naked.

199
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:52,098
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably better anyways.

200
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:58,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Real in-person naked is better than... Then you can see hoo-hoos and ha-has IRL.

201
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,642
[SPEAKER_03]: But unless there's some people in this world who shouldn't be naked.

202
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,936
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are the people playing Strip Uno on Xbox Live, probably.

203
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:10,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but they probably don't have pictures of themselves.

204
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:11,137
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably hired, like, a model.

205
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, boobies.

206
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:24,801
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've got to wonder if, like, on XTube or Pornotube or any of those sites, if there is, like, a taped Strip Uno game or something that's on those sites.

207
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why I have that curious thought.

208
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:29,783
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I'm thinking of...

209
00:17:30,643 --> 00:17:42,913
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering how Strip Uno would work since it takes so long to do one game I mean maybe it's like you have like if you do a draw four then you have to remove four articles of clothing or something that might work

210
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,471
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, a draw two, you remove two things.

211
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:02,193
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be the thing, is that if you get a draw four and play it on you, then either you draw four cards or you gotta take something off.

212
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:04,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it could be a choice thing.

213
00:18:05,194 --> 00:18:06,114
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be interesting.

214
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:07,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be interesting.

215
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:09,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that we're encouraging people how to play.

216
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:11,216
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think it should be a choice thing.

217
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:12,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you should just have to.

218
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:15,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

219
00:18:15,998 --> 00:18:20,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, we better... Gerardimo's laughing my ass off.

220
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:22,220
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, Gerardimo says, I love Jamie's take on this.

221
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,334
[SPEAKER_08]: She always is here to give us a refreshing perspective from a female point of view.

222
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:28,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Boobs are great.

223
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, that's our gaming week.

224
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:34,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into housekeeping tonight.

225
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:12,005
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of, I think, eight rare Grand Theft Auto 4 custom paint job type systems that was given from Gamerscore Blog to All Games Radio.

226
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me remind you how it works.

227
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,346
[SPEAKER_08]: We went over it last week, but I'll say it one more time.

228
00:19:16,206 --> 00:19:19,387
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have a bunch of people submit to us little radio things.

229
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:22,427
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how Grand Theft Auto has the little radio stuff in the game?

230
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:23,827
[SPEAKER_08]: How is it in Grand Theft Auto 4?

231
00:19:23,867 --> 00:19:25,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of funny parodies and things that you hear on the radio?

232
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:26,408
[SPEAKER_08]: There's funny commercials.

233
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:26,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Allgames.com

234
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:49,890
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,311
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

236
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:39,032
[SPEAKER_08]: is the Grand Theft Auto 4 game for whatever system you want, and that's courtesy of Mediaspective, one of the other shows on All Games Radio.

237
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:47,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Third prize, $20 points card for your system of choice from the Bobby Blackwolf show, the show that precedes us live here on All Games Radio.

238
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So, $23.

239
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki is ineligible, per the rules, so you don't have to worry about competing against him, although he really wants it.

240
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:56,305
[SPEAKER_08]: He really wants it, but he can't have it.

241
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:58,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe next time.

242
00:21:00,034 --> 00:21:01,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Loki, that was the rules.

243
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:01,700
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I say?

244
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:07,408
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so if you want to send in your entries, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

245
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:08,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Just use our general email address.

246
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,689
[SPEAKER_08]: We're separating all the entries in another folder.

247
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you don't have fancy MP3 recording stuff but you just have a really good idea, that might be good enough to win.

248
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:22,314
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

249
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,755
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do that either way you want.

250
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:25,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you have it.

251
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:29,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So we hope to get some more entries this week.

252
00:21:29,377 --> 00:21:30,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And set people on fire.

253
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:33,981
[SPEAKER_08]: and by the way, we listened to one today and I don't think we're going to play it tonight.

254
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,302
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll play it for you guys next week.

255
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:36,584
[SPEAKER_08]: We listened to one today.

256
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:44,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody did it out there just for fun because unfortunately he lived in Europe and unfortunately our friends overseas are ineligible because it's an NTSC console.

257
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:51,237
[SPEAKER_08]: He lives in Belgium to be specific and sent us a commercial and I'll tell you what, it was so funny, I cried laughing.

258
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:51,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

259
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,781
[SPEAKER_03]: for what people should do.

260
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:58,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but at the same time, I don't want 10 copies of that.

261
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I want people to come up with their own original thing.

262
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Makes sense, right?

263
00:22:01,146 --> 00:22:03,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll play it next week when it's almost over.

264
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:06,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And that way you can hear a really good one.

265
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:10,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll play the other qualifiers for you guys pretty soon.

266
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:15,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, and Nintendo Maniac64 says, does it have to be MP3?

267
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:19,238
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can use AAC, Wave, well, Wave might blow up our inbox.

268
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:24,120
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as Adobe Audition can open it, or Winamp, we'll play it.

269
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Just try not to blow up our inbox, that's all.

270
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:28,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

271
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's going to do it for housekeeping.

272
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:40,805
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not already there, join our LiveJournal, join our MySpace, join our Facebook, go to our website, orangelaunchradio.com, and listen to some gaming news, courtesy of Loki.

273
00:22:41,638 --> 00:22:53,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, part of a deal that EA had with Milton Bradley, they will be publishing Monopoly for the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.

274
00:22:54,048 --> 00:22:59,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's kind of funny because EA is trying to get a Monopoly on sports games.

275
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:02,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, karma.

276
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny.

277
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:03,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Har har.

278
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:04,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I see what you did there.

279
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:11,837
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently this is going to be a sped up version of the original game with some interactive mini games thrown in.

280
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:18,949
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know, doesn't really look like there's going to be a PS3 version at all.

281
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Monopoly, what can I say?

282
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:26,393
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense, because Monopoly never ends, so there needs to be some type of sped up version.

283
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:29,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Monopoly does end, I suppose, but it can go on forever.

284
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:34,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, if this came out on Xbox Live Arcade or something, I'd probably pick it up.

285
00:23:34,858 --> 00:23:35,478
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not!

286
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sound like it is, considering it's going to be on Wii and PlayStation 2 as well.

287
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It really doesn't sound like it could be on Xbox Live Arcade.

288
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,203
[SPEAKER_06]: It could do retail versions, though.

289
00:23:43,223 --> 00:23:44,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look at Puzzle Quest.

290
00:23:44,463 --> 00:23:45,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, true.

291
00:23:45,264 --> 00:23:49,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, anything's possible, but I don't know, doesn't it seem likely that maybe that's not the route they're going?

292
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:51,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is EA.

293
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:54,159
[SPEAKER_06]: They like whoring their shit out, so... I don't know.

294
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, maybe it'll support webcams on 360, then you can play Strip Monopoly.

295
00:23:59,041 --> 00:23:59,542
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that sound?

296
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:08,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as much fun as in real life, and if you play Strip Monopoly, you'll just get bored and pissed off at everybody else before anyone's naked.

297
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Monopoly is kind of boring after a while.

298
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:16,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Strip Monopoly would have to have like lap dances.

299
00:24:17,124 --> 00:24:23,410
[SPEAKER_03]: No, seriously, because you know how you win all of your money, but you have to have the option of being able to spend it on getting someone to get naked.

300
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's how you play Strip Monopoly.

301
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:26,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my idea for Strip Monopoly.

302
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,034
[SPEAKER_08]: You replace the chance and community chess cards.

303
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:31,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, the kind of stuff in there was like lame.

304
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:35,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was like you win second place in a beauty contest, collect $10, right?

305
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:35,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember that stuff?

306
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,102
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to replace those with X-rated things.

307
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:43,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you won second place in a crotchless underpants contest.

308
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:46,859
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, now it's time to show your community chest.

309
00:24:49,481 --> 00:24:50,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxury tax.

310
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:56,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, so Monopoly's coming out on all those systems.

311
00:24:56,406 --> 00:24:57,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think other board games to follow?

312
00:24:58,307 --> 00:25:00,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we strip Risk in our future?

313
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, remember, I think they were talking...

314
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:04,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

315
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Gerardimo says in chat, there would be cheap hotels in Strip Monopoly.

316
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:31,477
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I would like to see as... You get houses, and then you have a by-the-hour motel that you build.

317
00:25:31,637 --> 00:25:31,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

318
00:25:32,538 --> 00:25:34,459
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I would like... Oh, that'd be funny.

319
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Monopoly Red Light District Edition or something like that.

320
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:46,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to see... I don't think this is Milton Bradley, but I would like to see them do an Xbox Live Arcade version of Heroes Quest.

321
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that game was kind of like a halfway between like a board game and Dungeons and Dragons?

322
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:51,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, kind of, yeah, yeah.

323
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:52,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what was that other game?

324
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:58,792
[SPEAKER_06]: They had another game that was like something with volcanoes or something like that and they had little marbles that you could roll down and it would... Marble Madness?

325
00:25:59,072 --> 00:25:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't Marble Madness.

326
00:26:00,372 --> 00:26:00,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

327
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:00,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

328
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:04,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Marble Madness had things that shot balls.

329
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:07,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

330
00:26:09,095 --> 00:26:09,495
[SPEAKER_08]: What was it?

331
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:13,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Actdeft in chat said, Risk, conquer the world without your pants.

332
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:17,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they were bringing out Strip DDR and that made me think of Pantsless Rage.

333
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:19,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyhow.

334
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:21,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget it.

335
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:24,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the chatroom is just going to light up with Strip insert board game here.

336
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:25,253
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not funny anymore.

337
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:27,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, Strip Ants in Your Pants is kind of funny.

338
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:32,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they dump the ants in your pants and you strip to get them out.

339
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Strip, don't wake daddy.

340
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,341
[SPEAKER_08]: Strip Hungry Hungry Hip All right, forget it.

341
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

342
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:39,441
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

343
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:39,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob.

344
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:40,762
[SPEAKER_08]: How about more news?

345
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:41,302
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

346
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:47,764
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on and get away from such silly teehee nudity chat.

347
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But naked is great.

348
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:52,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get away from teehee nudity chat and talk about violence.

349
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:52,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Woohoo!

350
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:58,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And you gotta love a classic violent franchise called Splatterhouse.

351
00:26:58,709 --> 00:26:59,729
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember Splatterhouse?

352
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:03,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was for the TurboGrafx-16 slash PC Engine.

353
00:27:03,527 --> 00:27:06,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the main guy looked like a rip-off of Jason.

354
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:09,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and that game goes sort of annoying sometimes.

355
00:27:09,274 --> 00:27:10,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

356
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:17,943
[SPEAKER_08]: On the latest cover of EGM, they're talking about 35 different retro revivals, and right there on the cover, Splatterhouse.

357
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:34,467
[SPEAKER_08]: so Splatterhouse apparently is going to be coming back for a new wave on all the next gen consoles not a lot else known about the game at this time but I suppose when this magazine starts floating around out there we'll know a little bit more about it

358
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:45,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was, it was, the story though was fairly unique from, you know, the whole, the story wasn't a rip-off of Friday the 13th.

359
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, it talks about Splatterhouse has an ancient Mayan mask that is strapped onto his corpse or whatever.

360
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:55,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and he has to go save his girlfriend.

361
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,706
[SPEAKER_08]: So, interesting.

362
00:27:57,726 --> 00:27:59,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's probably already dead.

363
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:00,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if it'll be like a first-person game.

364
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:02,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not, because they have the title character right here.

365
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,091
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's probably going to be another platformer.

366
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:07,582
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens.

367
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:08,302
[SPEAKER_08]: More details.

368
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:08,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope.

369
00:28:08,702 --> 00:28:09,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't butcher it.

370
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:12,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Butcher characters in the game, but don't butcher the game itself.

371
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:13,666
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

372
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of butchered, not really.

373
00:28:17,889 --> 00:28:23,272
[SPEAKER_03]: For our buddies over in Europe, they've got a date for Super Smash Bros.

374
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:26,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl and it's going to be June 27th.

375
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:31,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in addition to that, WiiWare will be out on May 20th.

376
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:34,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So, put it in your diary.

377
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,481
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.

378
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:35,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming.

379
00:28:37,737 --> 00:28:39,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Diary, today I played Strip Clue.

380
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,422
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Miss Scarlet in the billiard room with my... Never mind.

381
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:13,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

382
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:14,227
[SPEAKER_08]: More stories, please.

383
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if they would consider that concealed weapon, but it was concealed.

384
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:21,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see here.

385
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:23,559
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a company called Shadowbane.

386
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,181
[SPEAKER_06]: What is wrong with this show?

387
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:29,166
[SPEAKER_06]: That's working with Nintendo to make an MMO.

388
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:32,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And the question is, they didn't really say what the MMO was.

389
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:37,088
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just calling it an as-yet-unnamed MMO project.

390
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:44,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But people are starting to think, hmm, perhaps are they developing Animal Crossing for the Wii?

391
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it just going to be another MMO that, you know...

392
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wait until E3.

393
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, enough with the speculation.

394
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:52,822
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

395
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to find out any more details until E3.

396
00:29:55,626 --> 00:30:02,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, Nintendo runs a very tight run ship where everybody's mouths are sealed and they can't say anything about it, no matter who's developing it.

397
00:30:02,656 --> 00:30:03,437
[SPEAKER_08]: So just wait.

398
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:12,540
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's inevitable the game is coming eventually, but I think it would be kind of funny if Nintendo surprised us and didn't announce the game at E3, but kind of came out of left field with something completely different.

399
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, think about it.

400
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you really want an MMO for Animal Crossing?

401
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:19,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, who's to say it's not a completely new IP?

402
00:30:19,881 --> 00:30:20,341
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

403
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:24,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Brother... Oh, Super Mario RPG.

404
00:30:24,682 --> 00:30:26,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Super Mario MMORPG.

405
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:27,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that.

406
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:29,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you'd make that work, but...

407
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:34,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's like plumber class or princess class.

408
00:30:34,364 --> 00:30:35,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Princess class.

409
00:30:35,204 --> 00:30:36,145
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I'd have to play that.

410
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:37,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a toadstool class.

411
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:40,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

412
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:41,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you're on to something.

413
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:42,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows?

414
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:43,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you could do something like that.

415
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:47,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Copyright, patentpending.com.

416
00:30:48,734 --> 00:30:49,214
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

417
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:50,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Money.

418
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,183
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

419
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:21,203
[SPEAKER_08]: This game made my pants hurt.

420
00:31:46,852 --> 00:32:09,515
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly and anyone can read those reviews of course this channel is going to be free and pretty much all the features that you've come to expect from the Japanese version will show up in this version as well so it's just a matter of when this is going to show up but sometime in the next month so that'll be pretty cool sooner rather than later right now everyone's a critic Nintendo's encouraging it

421
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:14,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's something else that Nintendo themselves is going to be criticized for.

422
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:15,699
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

423
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:28,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a discussion going on with Iwata that was after they've gone through all their, I guess, financial meeting that they go through, like any big company has.

424
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:37,713
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's quoted as saying that their projection for the year is not based on hardware cuts and they are not going to need them.

425
00:32:38,394 --> 00:32:46,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So translated from corporate to real English, that means we're still making money, so forget it.

426
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to lower prices.

427
00:32:48,311 --> 00:32:50,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't think they're low prices anyways.

428
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:58,982
[SPEAKER_06]: They're having problems keeping enough stock for this hardware for portables and consoles.

429
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:02,826
[SPEAKER_06]: The demand's not going down for any of them, so there's no reason to lower the prices.

430
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:03,467
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be stupid.

431
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:04,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we're sold out of it.

432
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:05,969
[SPEAKER_06]: People just want to buy it.

433
00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:06,510
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll buy it for $700.

434
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's drop it to $99 because we don't like money.

435
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:10,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's more.

436
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:19,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So far, they've sold 25 million Wii and they've sold 70 million DSs.

437
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:26,726
[SPEAKER_03]: The sales are up 73% for the financial year with 47.7% profit.

438
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:27,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not bad at all.

439
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was some other news that came out there that are upping their allocations of what they're going to be making each month for the Wii.

440
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:43,690
[SPEAKER_06]: From 1.6 million units being manufactured to 2.4 million.

441
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:50,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully that will ease the retailers' pain out there, but I don't think it's enough.

442
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:52,978
[SPEAKER_06]: But they will conquer the world soon.

443
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:54,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon.

444
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Another franchise is hoping to-

445
00:34:11,477 --> 00:34:15,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though they're not going to lower the price of the Wii, are they ever going to come out with these different modifications?

446
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is that something else they want to wait to pull out of the hat?

447
00:34:18,282 --> 00:34:21,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's something that you want to bring out when the demand starts to drop.

448
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:25,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people are like, it gives them another reason to buy the console.

449
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:38,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that right now, until the demand starts dipping down a little bit, until they start flattening out the demand versus what they've got in stock, I don't think you're going to see any of these new colors or price drops or any sort of bundles or whatever.

450
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they don't...

451
00:34:39,497 --> 00:34:39,757
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

452
00:34:50,109 --> 00:34:56,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one franchise that's making a return pretty soon, which is pretty cool, actually, is Earthworm Jim.

453
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,438
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually relaunching the franchise.

454
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:11,889
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be doing a brand new cartoon series, as well as some new video games that are going to be coming to platforms all over the place, including, hopefully, PlayStation 2, 3, and Xbox 360 and Wii.

455
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:12,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

456
00:35:15,811 --> 00:35:22,355
[SPEAKER_06]: No word yet on when this is all going to happen, but hopefully very soon.

457
00:35:22,516 --> 00:35:26,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see some more Earthworm Jim probably this year maybe.

458
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:28,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

459
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you think all of a sudden they want to bring back this one?

460
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:33,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

461
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:35,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, why bring back Bionic Commando?

462
00:35:36,112 --> 00:35:37,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Splatterhouse, I guess, huh?

463
00:35:37,712 --> 00:35:40,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess retro is all the rage, so why not bring back Earthworm Jim?

464
00:35:41,274 --> 00:35:45,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that game always used to crack me up simply for the fact that when you turned it on, like, remember the title screen?

465
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:47,736
[SPEAKER_08]: It was somebody burping the name Earthworm Jim.

466
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't a bad game, either.

467
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:52,058
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of cute for a Super Nintendo game.

468
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:53,819
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the system I had it on, was Super Nintendo.

469
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that one of the games that Tommy Tallarico scored, too?

470
00:35:58,301 --> 00:35:58,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

471
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:00,061
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the games he's kind of famous for.

472
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:01,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

473
00:36:03,615 --> 00:36:04,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2

474
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,921
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to be coming to the Virtual Console.

475
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:34,764
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, just an FYI, Clayfighter and Boogerman are also on their way out.

476
00:36:35,124 --> 00:36:37,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Both also the Genesis versions of the games.

477
00:36:37,505 --> 00:36:38,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Clayfighter is great.

478
00:36:38,246 --> 00:36:39,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Clayfighter is fucking awesome.

479
00:36:39,567 --> 00:36:45,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Clayfighter is pretty rad, although it's one of those games, I don't know, for me, like you play it for an hour and then the joke's old.

480
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,250
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

481
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about Helga with her opera attack.

482
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:49,753
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Frosty?

483
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad Mr. Frosty, whatever his name was.

484
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:53,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to always play as the Blob.

485
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:55,056
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my favorite.

486
00:36:55,216 --> 00:36:55,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Blob.

487
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:55,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

488
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:58,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad Mr. Foxy was great.

489
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma says the Genesis version has an extra level, doesn't it?

490
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:02,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

491
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,606
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

492
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:06,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, all those games are on their way out.

493
00:37:06,788 --> 00:37:07,748
[SPEAKER_08]: So soon.

494
00:37:07,788 --> 00:37:08,469
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a date.

495
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:11,351
[SPEAKER_08]: But usually when these games are announced, there's less than a month to go.

496
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.

497
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:18,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in chat real quick says, Tiger Claw, Tommy Tallarico is working on the new Earthworm Jim, or so I heard.

498
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:19,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor alert.

499
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:21,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Rumor alert.

500
00:37:21,597 --> 00:37:21,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you?

501
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:30,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, especially for those of us who are artists would probably have found this really hilarious.

502
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:35,156
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know the deal with the Okami Wii cover with the IGN watermark?

503
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:37,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yes, the hilarity that ensued last week, yes.

504
00:37:38,057 --> 00:37:43,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is really funny because I don't see why they bother watermarking it in the first place when it's actually Capcom's art.

505
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:46,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of like, we're going to put our name on it.

506
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ours now.

507
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,320
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

508
00:37:50,229 --> 00:38:04,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, because of this clusterfuck of craptitude, Capcom has released two new covers that you can go on their website and... What?

509
00:38:04,836 --> 00:38:07,238
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm laughing because I think this is just a stupid idea.

510
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:07,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

511
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want the covers to begin with because they're pretty.

512
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:20,122
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go to Capcom.com slash art redemption, all one word, you can pick one of two covers.

513
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:27,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually either get the original or two special versions that they have.

514
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:40,735
[SPEAKER_03]: and one of them is a completely painted green background with the wolf and a neat looking other side on the back and the other which I personally like.

515
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:47,838
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like some level artwork with the wolf superimposed in the front where the front cover would be and cherry blossoms.

516
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:49,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that one better myself.

517
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:50,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Art Redemption

518
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:08,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think you can.

519
00:39:08,873 --> 00:39:11,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, it's just funny.

520
00:39:11,234 --> 00:39:16,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the thing is silly because, honestly, how many people are going to do that when there's the more hilarity of... I'm doing it right now.

521
00:39:17,056 --> 00:39:20,818
[SPEAKER_08]: OMG, I have the uber rare watermarked cover.

522
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:21,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

523
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:26,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even better, you just get one of those and you're like, oh, hey, look, there's a GameSpot watermark on there now.

524
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:29,541
[SPEAKER_08]: You never know.

525
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:34,089
[SPEAKER_08]: but hey, free game covers and Jamie's ordering one right now even though she doesn't have the game.

526
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:39,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, VS Jason SV says they don't ask for a serial number so yes, you can do it.

527
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:40,752
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't and I'm ordering one right now.

528
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:41,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

529
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:43,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you order two?

530
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you go in for the studio?

531
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:45,214
[SPEAKER_03]: No, let's just pick one.

532
00:39:45,294 --> 00:39:45,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go order one too.

533
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:46,755
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting the pretty one.

534
00:39:47,255 --> 00:39:47,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

535
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:48,656
[SPEAKER_03]: The one with the cherry blossoms.

536
00:39:48,676 --> 00:39:50,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get the ugly one then for the studio.

537
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:52,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let my friend know who really loves this game too.

538
00:39:53,098 --> 00:39:53,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

539
00:39:54,928 --> 00:40:01,789
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's some pretty cool mods that are out there right now for Unreal Tournament 3, although this one seems to kind of take the cake right now.

540
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros., they made a Super Mario Bros.

541
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:14,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Unreal Tournament 3 mod, and what it is basically is it's kind of like a 2D version of Unreal Tournament, but with Super Mario Bros.

542
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:15,112
[SPEAKER_06]: themed levels.

543
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:21,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can run around kind of like, I don't know, Super Smash Unreal Tournament or something like that.

544
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:27,218
[SPEAKER_06]: It is available to download off of the Epic MegaGames forums.

545
00:40:27,738 --> 00:40:38,427
[SPEAKER_06]: So check out EpicGames.com, check their forums, and you'll find a link to UT2D Super Mario Beta for the PC and PlayStation 3.

546
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:39,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

547
00:40:40,068 --> 00:40:42,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope more games support mods and we see more things like this.

548
00:40:44,518 --> 00:40:45,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are things I can download to the PlayStation 3?

549
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:51,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can download any of the PC mods for Unreal Tournament 3 for the PlayStation 3.

550
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:54,242
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a great niche for the PlayStation 3 right there.

551
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:58,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of hope they explore more things like that with the customizations and more games.

552
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:02,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we talked about that when this whole game first came out, but to actually see kind of the...

553
00:41:05,126 --> 00:41:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Metamorphosis of that.

554
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:06,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.

555
00:41:06,346 --> 00:41:07,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is only scratching the surface.

556
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:16,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, think of all the games out there using the Unreal Engine that they did total conversions for and made a completely different game out of the whole thing.

557
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're going to see some of these come out and then you're going to actually be able to play these on your PlayStation 3.

558
00:41:22,352 --> 00:41:29,594
[SPEAKER_06]: So Unreal Tournament will essentially become all these different games, which is pretty awesome and definitely worth replay value.

559
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:32,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

560
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:33,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh...

561
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:37,101
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Janiya said, I played that over at my friend's house.

562
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:37,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Good God.

563
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:47,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's do one more story here, and then we're going to get into some release dates, but this could affect a lot of different releases coming out soon.

564
00:41:48,616 --> 00:41:52,057
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii end-user license agreement was recently updated.

565
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:58,278
[SPEAKER_08]: You know all that legal blah blah blah that usually you don't even read and you just bother to click accept, you know, just kind of go through it.

566
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:01,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Jamie, do you read every word on those end-user license agreements?

567
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:02,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?

568
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,480
[SPEAKER_08]: You know those things you have to click accept to, all the legal blah blah blah?

569
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what you mean when my reply was huh?

570
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:07,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

571
00:42:07,621 --> 00:42:08,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh...

572
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:24,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Wii just recently updated theirs, and the interesting thing about it, I mean, I could read this whole thing, but basically the part you want to know is that the Wii console and the Wii Network service are not designed for use with any unauthorized device or any non-licensed accessory.

573
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:29,283
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not use any such device in connection with your Wii console or Wii Network service.

574
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:32,225
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do it, it's illegal, voids the warranty, blah, blah, blah.

575
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:37,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's interesting that they updated this to specifically target unlicensed accessories, but...

576
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:43,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that has to do with the recent surgence of all these fake Mario Kart wheel things we've seen?

577
00:43:03,396 --> 00:43:04,656
[SPEAKER_08]: I need an NES Advantage update.

578
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:28,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Let my NES Advantage work with the Wii.

579
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:29,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

580
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:31,855
[SPEAKER_08]: They should come out with an NES Advantage controller.

581
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:32,635
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

582
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:36,816
[SPEAKER_03]: There were the official items that had turbo buttons and crap.

583
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:46,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Even NEC got it right with the TurboGrafx and PC Engine that it had a turbo switch on there that you could put it up to three.

584
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't see what the big deal is with cheats or anything.

585
00:43:53,857 --> 00:43:59,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember on the NES Advantage, I think it was that one, they had a slow button, too, that was just the start button being hit really quick?

586
00:43:59,521 --> 00:44:00,662
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what was great about that?

587
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:01,082
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

588
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:02,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Shooting games.

589
00:44:02,803 --> 00:44:03,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

590
00:44:03,623 --> 00:44:05,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Life Force.

591
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:11,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless every time you hit pause, it goes do-do-do-do-do, and then pauses or whatever, and then so if you get that, like, it doesn't work.

592
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It's horrible.

593
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,491
[SPEAKER_08]: You just hear that noise over and over.

594
00:44:15,925 --> 00:44:17,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It worked great on, like, ice hockey, though.

595
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:18,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I remember.

596
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:20,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have an NES Advantage out here somewhere.

597
00:44:20,967 --> 00:44:23,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we used them in one of our photo shoots that we did.

598
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:23,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one.

599
00:44:23,667 --> 00:44:24,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fun.

600
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,188
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a robot.

601
00:44:26,448 --> 00:44:27,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob the robot.

602
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:27,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

603
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:29,449
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, let's get to some release dates.

604
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:31,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start over in the UK, shall we?

605
00:44:31,912 --> 00:44:34,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

606
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:35,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff is coming out.

607
00:44:35,495 --> 00:44:36,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Really only two games.

608
00:44:37,096 --> 00:44:39,518
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 29th, you get Grand Theft Auto 4.

609
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:40,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yippee.

610
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the 2nd of May, Dream Pinball, which I'm actually more excited about than Grand Theft Auto 4.

611
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:53,498
[SPEAKER_03]: and just a few other things that are going to be coming out in the month that's pretty good is the pool party.

612
00:44:53,779 --> 00:44:54,259
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

613
00:44:55,941 --> 00:45:02,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been listed Rock Band heading out, Death Junior, the Iron Man game and Apollo Justice.

614
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,530
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have that to look forward to coming up in May.

615
00:45:06,516 --> 00:45:20,007
[SPEAKER_06]: For the US, we're getting Baseball Mogul 2009 on the PC, Toy Shop on the DS, Let's Yoga on the DS, Let's Pilates on the DS.

616
00:45:20,447 --> 00:45:21,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not.

617
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:23,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Pilates on the DS.

618
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:37,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Brain Voyage on the DS, Great Wars Nations The Spartans on PC, and then let's see SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 on PSP and PlayStation 2.

619
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:49,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we've got Iron Man coming out on Friday on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, and DS.

620
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a couple smaller games here.

621
00:45:52,082 --> 00:46:02,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Today we had Mario Kart Wii, and on Tuesday we have Grand Theft Auto 4, but I'm sure no one's really going to be paying attention to that, and that's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

622
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:04,130
[SPEAKER_06]: But what the hell is Grand Theft Auto 4?

623
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, I haven't heard of that game ever.

624
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:06,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of it.

625
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:07,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Never heard of it.

626
00:46:07,673 --> 00:46:10,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto 4 is also coming out in Asia.

627
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,515
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a general release.

628
00:46:11,795 --> 00:46:17,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I usually do Japanese release dates, but also some general Asia release dates that are much broader region.

629
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:21,822
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I am most confident that is not any type of localized version.

630
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:27,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty much just a version of the game from the same one the US and the rest of the world is getting.

631
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:32,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Japan is scheduled to get a translated version of the game.

632
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,811
[SPEAKER_08]: They got one for the other Grand Theft Auto games, didn't they?

633
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:35,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

634
00:46:35,892 --> 00:46:36,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe in the future.

635
00:46:36,592 --> 00:46:37,653
[SPEAKER_06]: They got them way late.

636
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:39,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they got them way later.

637
00:46:40,455 --> 00:46:44,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like, hey, same reason we have to wait forever for JRPGs to come out over here.

638
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:46,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Same kind of logic, just in reverse.

639
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:54,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So honestly, there is not a whole lot coming out because of the whole Grand Theft Auto thing, even though it's not coming out in Japan.

640
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:55,687
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get that.

641
00:46:56,128 --> 00:46:59,250
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is, on the Nintendo Wii, coming out in Japan.

642
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:02,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Pro Yaku Family Stadium is coming out.

643
00:47:03,173 --> 00:47:04,074
[SPEAKER_08]: That's baseball.

644
00:47:04,094 --> 00:47:04,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

645
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:05,495
[SPEAKER_08]: This is interesting.

646
00:47:05,996 --> 00:47:07,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Link's Crossbow Training.

647
00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:12,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize we got it way before Japan, but it is just now making its way to Japan on May 1st.

648
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:13,546
[SPEAKER_08]: The Wii Zapper and Link's Crossbow Training.

649
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:15,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they aren't missing much.

650
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:18,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you see the pro-yaku, that's baseball.

651
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:19,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Baseball.

652
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:21,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, who doesn't love... Excuse me.

653
00:47:23,075 --> 00:47:23,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

654
00:47:24,056 --> 00:47:24,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm dying.

655
00:47:24,616 --> 00:47:25,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob's dying.

656
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:26,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I get his stuff.

657
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:27,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Live radio.

658
00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:28,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus.

659
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo DS.

660
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:30,601
[SPEAKER_08]: May 1st.

661
00:47:31,062 --> 00:47:32,483
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of stuff comes out.

662
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of it is just peripherals.

663
00:47:34,464 --> 00:47:38,648
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, you can get a new shiny pouch and a touch pen in all these different colors.

664
00:47:38,968 --> 00:47:40,709
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there are some games coming out as well.

665
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:42,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Emblem of Gundam is coming out.

666
00:47:43,512 --> 00:47:52,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Katekyo Hitman Reborn Fate of Heat comes out on the Nintendo DS as well as Anpanman to Asobo ABC Kyoshitsu.

667
00:47:52,499 --> 00:47:52,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Anpanman

668
00:47:52,759 --> 00:47:53,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Panmon!

669
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Panmon is great.

670
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:56,763
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like bread.

671
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he gets his own DS game very soon.

672
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:03,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the Sony PSP, Nippon no Asoko Dei.

673
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:07,653
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's some type of Japanese traveler game.

674
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:09,135
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out from Sony themselves.

675
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:12,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It means what?

676
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Nippon's Japan.

677
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,061
[SPEAKER_08]: No Asoko Dei.

678
00:48:15,953 --> 00:48:19,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds like it would be traveling because it needs to go over there.

679
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:40,072
[SPEAKER_08]: But probably not for us.

680
00:48:40,092 --> 00:48:41,313
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably not something you want to import.

681
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you what Anpanman looks like.

682
00:48:43,274 --> 00:48:43,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you do that.

683
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:45,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Post me a link in chat or something.

684
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's cute.

685
00:48:49,418 --> 00:48:51,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to link it in the chat room because Anpanman's adorable.

686
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:52,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Enough cuteness.

687
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:53,601
[SPEAKER_08]: More gaming news.

688
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Anpanman.

689
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:57,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if they have any screenshots.

690
00:48:57,548 --> 00:49:02,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Warrior Bob was over in Japan recently and he IM'd me.

691
00:49:02,971 --> 00:49:05,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So I told him I wanted an Anpanman plushie.

692
00:49:05,572 --> 00:49:05,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

693
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:07,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

694
00:49:07,473 --> 00:49:10,655
[SPEAKER_03]: He asked what cotton game it was I was looking for.

695
00:49:11,936 --> 00:49:12,836
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.

696
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:14,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was very nice of him to make it.

697
00:49:14,437 --> 00:49:15,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Make him come back on the show at some point.

698
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:29,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the show, which I should be paying more attention to instead of Anpanman, there's details released about Bionic Commander's multiplayer for anyone who was interested.

699
00:49:31,714 --> 00:49:39,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that is only going to be for offline play for Bionic Commando Rearmed.

700
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:46,542
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will be presented in a zoomed out 2D sort of mode.

701
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:52,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of, I guess, like the playing a lot of people in Smash Brothers is done, I guess.

702
00:49:53,745 --> 00:49:55,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Deathmatch, Last Man Standing.

703
00:49:58,148 --> 00:50:03,712
[SPEAKER_03]: But they say the defining object is going to be your bionic arms.

704
00:50:03,772 --> 00:50:08,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to block projectiles, grab power-ups.

705
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:15,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have that as your only weapon.

706
00:50:20,876 --> 00:50:29,163
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're also saying is that they've made this 150 megabytes also for the size.

707
00:50:30,424 --> 00:50:32,827
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to have some stuff.

708
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:38,632
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be live arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC in May.

709
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:44,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, and there's one other mode that you have to go around without touching the floor.

710
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:47,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

711
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:51,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of excited to check out the new Bionic Commando game.

712
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:52,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be good times.

713
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:56,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I should call that mode where you don't touch the floor Hot Lava mode.

714
00:50:56,346 --> 00:51:00,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember playing Hot Lava in kindergarten or elementary school?

715
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:01,508
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

716
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:02,609
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is this?

717
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:06,811
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically you'd play on playground equipment and the ground was lava.

718
00:51:06,951 --> 00:51:14,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like tag, but one person is the lava monster or whatever and they have to stay on the ground where everyone else is up on stuff and you have to try tag them and stuff.

719
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:19,565
[SPEAKER_06]: God, you're really not up on elementary school recess games.

720
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:19,866
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

721
00:51:20,006 --> 00:51:21,526
[SPEAKER_08]: After the show, let's go play Hot Lava.

722
00:51:21,766 --> 00:51:23,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I know an elementary school year.

723
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that would be a funny commercial for our show.

724
00:51:30,149 --> 00:51:32,009
[SPEAKER_03]: We had better games when I was in elementary school.

725
00:51:32,029 --> 00:51:35,190
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens when you take the video games away from the video gamers?

726
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We took it a step further.

727
00:51:36,891 --> 00:51:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to have a game, a tag, that would involve a hula hoop and we'd throw it at each other.

728
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:50,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Because playing a game like Hot Love or whatever with a very large piece of playground equipment, you can't obviously reach up 12 feet above you.

729
00:51:50,814 --> 00:51:53,695
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can throw a hula hoop at someone's head 12 feet above you, so...

730
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,175
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

731
00:52:13,618 --> 00:52:17,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, apparently, like, everybody knows Hot Lava in chat.

732
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:18,404
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

733
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:22,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there was a game we played that was just like that, except it was Sharks.

734
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:25,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was Sharks or something like that, where everything was Sharks.

735
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:27,636
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say there was a type game.

736
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:30,940
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember a tag game that you played on Patreon, but it was like Sharks, I think.

737
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:31,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.

738
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:32,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways.

739
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:33,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, real quick.

740
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:34,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to say this.

741
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:37,233
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we all love those playground games from when we were kids.

742
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,494
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, those that we can remember.

743
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:40,035
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I remember Smear the Queer.

744
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:40,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys play that?

745
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:41,676
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

746
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:43,316
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember a bunch of us got busted.

747
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:45,677
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of us got busted for playing that one day.

748
00:52:46,178 --> 00:52:47,698
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something you played with the football.

749
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, whoever, like, had the football was the queer.

750
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And you had to run around.

751
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:53,921
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just horrible.

752
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:54,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

753
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,883
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, the way things turned out, you know.

754
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:04,464
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't wish to get smeared on a daily basis anymore, but I think that's why we got in trouble for playing it.

755
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:05,685
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to play sockball.

756
00:53:06,005 --> 00:53:10,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But then everybody would try to grab that person and grab the ball away from them.

757
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:14,426
[SPEAKER_03]: We would put a tennis ball in a sock and throw it at people.

758
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:17,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not joking.

759
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:27,109
[SPEAKER_08]: That reminds me of that scene in what the hell was that movie by Kubrick, the war movie, Full Metal Jacket, where they all put the soap in the sock and start beating the guy with it.

760
00:53:27,506 --> 00:53:31,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the whole point of this is that it's sort of like crazy dodgeball.

761
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:36,249
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get hit with the sockball, then you have to go out, but you also become one of the people who gets to throw the sockball.

762
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:38,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

763
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, back on topic.

764
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:43,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say, we never were on topic on this show, damn it.

765
00:53:44,552 --> 00:53:48,813
[SPEAKER_08]: They need to compile a bunch of playground games into a game.

766
00:53:48,913 --> 00:53:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's been done before, but not very well.

767
00:53:51,874 --> 00:53:56,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say they need all these classes, but they need it on Xbox Live Arcade.

768
00:53:57,088 --> 00:54:00,229
[SPEAKER_08]: and something like, you know, where everybody's competing to be the king of the schoolyard.

769
00:54:00,269 --> 00:54:01,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Who wouldn't play that game?

770
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's like a bunch of mini-games.

771
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:02,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.

772
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:03,991
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be fun.

773
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:13,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, they should actually do, like, a Simon Says one that uses, like, some sort of motion sensor or the Wiimote so it can tell where you're holding the Wiimote.

774
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:15,016
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be fun.

775
00:54:15,036 --> 00:54:15,816
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

776
00:54:18,141 --> 00:54:19,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, I gotta get chat comments.

777
00:54:19,782 --> 00:54:26,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Ranma says the game I was talking about, he says, Sky, that's called a blanket party, and now a highly illegal thing to do in the military.

778
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:27,927
[SPEAKER_08]: A blanket party.

779
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:31,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, let's play Beach Blanket Bingo.

780
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Bionic Commando.

781
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:42,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not coming to Virtual Console anytime soon because Nintendo doesn't want it to.

782
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:53,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, of course, coming from Capcom's Vice President of Strategic Planning, Christian Svensson, who basically says that it couldn't happen.

783
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:56,722
[SPEAKER_06]: It is up to Nintendo to allow it to happen.

784
00:54:57,103 --> 00:54:57,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently...

785
00:54:59,018 --> 00:55:03,219
[SPEAKER_06]: The thoughts are maybe they didn't like the fact that Hitler's head explodes in the game.

786
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:05,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the fact that, I don't know, Hitler's in the game at all.

787
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,780
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's Mr. D!

788
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:15,102
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a fucking new... We need, like, Castle Wolfenstein to come to Xbox Live Arcade.

789
00:55:15,122 --> 00:55:15,922
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be the shit.

790
00:55:16,162 --> 00:55:16,842
[SPEAKER_06]: With multiplayer.

791
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:19,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't they just rename him to Smitler?

792
00:55:20,343 --> 00:55:21,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know he has another name.

793
00:55:21,924 --> 00:55:22,824
[SPEAKER_08]: But... Boll?

794
00:55:23,444 --> 00:55:25,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, name him Ui Boll.

795
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:26,965
[SPEAKER_03]: In Bionic Commando.

796
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:28,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Hitler.

797
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:29,551
[SPEAKER_08]: But he looked like Hitler.

798
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:34,121
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how there's some cats that look like Hitler and there's a whole website dedicated to that?

799
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:36,134
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy looked like Hitler.

800
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he was in the Japanese one.

801
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:38,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

802
00:55:39,055 --> 00:55:54,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, something that will be coming to the Nintendo Wii, however, well, if rumors are to be believed anyway, this is a rumor, big rumor, it was a tip that was sent in to GoNintendo that Metroid Prime is being remade for the Nintendo Wii.

803
00:55:54,377 --> 00:56:03,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, keep in mind, Metroid Prime 3 was already on the Nintendo Wii, but the rumor is that 1 and 2 are being remade with all new controls and they will all be packaged into one

804
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Comprehensive Metroid Prime game.

805
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:10,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Like an ultimate box set, if you will, for the Nintendo Wii.

806
00:56:10,483 --> 00:56:10,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Thoughts?

807
00:56:11,864 --> 00:56:15,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, GameCube port getting some stuck-on waggle controls.

808
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:17,328
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like the Wii.

809
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:22,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it just sounds like a cheap play for more money.

810
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:23,492
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know there's people that would buy it.

811
00:56:24,973 --> 00:56:26,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Metroid Prime 2, the search for more money.

812
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:28,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just thinking that.

813
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:33,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if they would go back and add stuff to Metroid Prime 3 to kind of attract people that might already have it.

814
00:56:34,653 --> 00:56:36,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Metroid Redone in the style of Metroid Prime

815
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:56,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't touch Super Metroid.

816
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:57,533
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

817
00:56:57,773 --> 00:56:59,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Metroid is a god among men.

818
00:56:59,695 --> 00:57:11,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying it not be, of course, the same game, but I would like to see what some of those levels would look like from a different perspective, because I want the music, you know, and everything.

819
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:12,428
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

820
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:35,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, we need an OLR-troid.

821
00:58:06,752 --> 00:58:06,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Cat's Yowl

822
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Operetta of the LaserCat?

823
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:41,742
[SPEAKER_05]: LaserCat Operetta.

824
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:47,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it would be Screeching Match of the LaserCat.

825
00:58:49,427 --> 00:58:50,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Chorus, that's it, Chorus.

826
00:58:51,697 --> 00:59:05,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Some comments from chat Sephiroth1215 says Metroid Prime 1 felt a lot like Super Metroid Okay, I disagree with that comment 100% Because when I played Metroid Prime 1 for the first time I seriously, I was like, what the fuck did they do to Metroid?

827
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:19,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And I threw the controller I did not like Metroid Prime at all when I first played it Now granted, I own Metroid Prime 3 now and it's grown on me this series But I was so mad that they raped Metroid by making it a first player game I was not so warm and friendly on the whole first person conversion

828
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:26,429
[SPEAKER_08]: J-Rod says they need to go remake and import Eternal Darkness, never mind this Metroid nonsense, to which Siren follows up with, somebody take over Eternal Darkness is a good idea and give more games insanity gauges.

829
00:59:41,821 --> 00:59:42,702
[SPEAKER_03]: E3, Call of Cthulhu, Morphine

830
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Some more stuff, how's that?

831
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:17,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, so the Metroid Prime Trilogy may be on its way to Wii, but we would rather Nintendo just put the resources into giving us a new 2D Metroid of uberness on the Wii, but we'll see.

832
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:19,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm very mad at Nintendo right now.

833
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:19,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is this?

834
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Pissed off!

835
01:00:21,876 --> 01:00:23,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Not up to F you, pissed offness.

836
01:00:24,457 --> 01:00:28,981
[SPEAKER_03]: But Club Nintendo, this elusive thing, this, you know...

837
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful organization is out in Australia, not in America.

838
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:45,213
[SPEAKER_03]: For everyone who got their copy of, what game was it?

839
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:47,801
[SPEAKER_03]: It was from Mario Kart.

840
01:00:48,341 --> 01:00:58,163
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an invitation in there with a code on it that you could use to use that code and get Nintendo Star Points.

841
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:06,024
[SPEAKER_03]: The site is not active yet, but you can get started on your saving up, I guess.

842
01:01:08,225 --> 01:01:08,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

843
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:10,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

844
01:01:10,885 --> 01:01:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it, Nintendo!

845
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:14,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, Nintendo just needs to give it to us in America already.

846
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:15,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop being whores.

847
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:20,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know a nicer way to say it.

848
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:21,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop being hoarse.

849
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

850
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:46,919
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, earlier this week it's not surprising because, you know, with a big game like Grand Theft Auto 4 obviously people are going to get early and leak it to the internet as they did, but to commemorate such a leakage the notorious BitTorrent site, the Pirate Bay is now calling themselves Liberty Bay with, you know,

851
01:01:48,235 --> 01:01:52,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Nico Bellic of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the front page there.

852
01:01:53,199 --> 01:01:54,559
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of funny, I guess.

853
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:56,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Pirate Bay so much.

854
01:01:57,722 --> 01:01:59,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, should you be admitting that on this program?

855
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because I'll tell you why I love the Pirate Bay.

856
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:15,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of where their servers are located, it's not illegal for them to have and distribute their content, the torrent files.

857
01:02:15,794 --> 01:02:18,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, that's where you get your Doctor Who fix, isn't it?

858
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:23,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay, enough said.

859
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: but what's funny is that all of these different facilities will send them letters of complaint and use ceases and desist and so they publish them on their front page and make fun of them and point out where what they're doing is legal in the country they're operating from and somewhere out there right now Ross Steel UT is throwing something at his radio no one has been able to shut them down

860
01:02:50,871 --> 01:02:51,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

861
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:55,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but just because it's out there doesn't make it right.

862
01:02:56,717 --> 01:02:59,080
[SPEAKER_03]: But it makes it awesome, and they're hilarious.

863
01:02:59,961 --> 01:03:02,383
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, downloading import TV shows is nothing.

864
01:03:02,543 --> 01:03:04,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't think that should be a big deal, honestly.

865
01:03:06,711 --> 01:03:09,814
[SPEAKER_08]: If they've aired and they're gone and you want to get them, why not?

866
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:13,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, especially if they're never going to air over here.

867
01:03:13,496 --> 01:03:17,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I think somebody ought to upload a torrent of all this, all the old episodes of this.

868
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:20,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Or actually, they don't need to because all these episodes are online now.

869
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:21,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Starcade.

870
01:03:21,522 --> 01:03:22,403
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember Starcade?

871
01:03:22,603 --> 01:03:22,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

872
01:03:22,783 --> 01:03:24,504
[SPEAKER_08]: This show was fucking badass.

873
01:03:24,925 --> 01:03:27,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember this show growing up.

874
01:03:27,747 --> 01:03:28,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a show.

875
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,548
[SPEAKER_08]: It was hosted by this guy.

876
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:31,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I think his name was Jeff something.

877
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:32,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a long time.

878
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff, crap in the head.

879
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:36,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to love watching Starcade on G4 and then they got rid of it.

880
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:37,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladybug Cops.

881
01:03:59,685 --> 01:04:00,145
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

882
01:04:20,237 --> 01:04:21,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And who didn't want that when they were a kid?

883
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, I'm going to email these people.

884
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:26,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to email these people and see if we can get them on the show.

885
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,221
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would be great, though, is if they were doing it.

886
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:34,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I know this was before then, but giving away the SNK machines.

887
01:04:34,063 --> 01:04:34,664
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

888
01:04:34,724 --> 01:04:36,465
[SPEAKER_03]: With the multi-card.

889
01:04:37,265 --> 01:04:38,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan and I still want one of those.

890
01:04:38,265 --> 01:04:41,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get them on the show because you know I've got to ask that question.

891
01:04:41,947 --> 01:04:43,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Will this show ever come back?

892
01:04:44,093 --> 01:04:44,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it blend?

893
01:04:45,153 --> 01:04:47,514
[SPEAKER_06]: If only I had the money, I would bring it back.

894
01:04:47,614 --> 01:04:47,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

895
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:49,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you don't have the rights to it.

896
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,916
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd have to make up a new video game show.

897
01:04:50,936 --> 01:04:51,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

898
01:04:51,456 --> 01:04:52,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd buy the rights to it.

899
01:04:52,576 --> 01:04:53,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really.

900
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:54,477
[SPEAKER_06]: What are they going to do?

901
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:55,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit on the rights to that?

902
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:57,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be called OL Arcade.

903
01:04:58,638 --> 01:04:58,898
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

904
01:04:59,239 --> 01:04:59,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent pending.

905
01:05:23,434 --> 01:05:24,435
[SPEAKER_02]: It's done out of respect.

906
01:05:24,575 --> 01:05:34,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And if anything, and this also goes back to the argument with music and stuff, if anything, those fan subs probably drive up interest in the actual anime title.

907
01:05:34,479 --> 01:05:39,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it comes over here, it would probably fare a lot better than, say, if it wasn't fan sub.

908
01:05:40,042 --> 01:05:44,444
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya and Actdeft in chat almost at the same time go, OL Arcade.

909
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:47,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

910
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:12,676
[SPEAKER_08]: but a little different to not get sued.

911
01:06:12,876 --> 01:06:26,448
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just that one show and I can't remember what it was but it was where you'd have like a partner team and they'd go through this trivia business and then they'd get to run through with these Velcro jackets.

912
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:30,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was just reading about that show on Wiki the other day.

913
01:06:30,371 --> 01:06:31,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just reading about it.

914
01:06:31,913 --> 01:06:32,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat will say it.

915
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:34,195
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Nick Arcade.

916
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:34,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something else.

917
01:06:35,296 --> 01:06:36,557
[SPEAKER_03]: This predates Nick Arcade.

918
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:39,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat will say it in a minute.

919
01:06:40,294 --> 01:06:45,760
[SPEAKER_03]: But I used to watch that show all the freaking time, and I so wanted to be on it.

920
01:06:47,932 --> 01:06:49,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Video Power, Credit to Ranma.

921
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:50,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Power, that was it.

922
01:06:51,176 --> 01:06:54,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was also GameProTV.

923
01:06:55,281 --> 01:06:57,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know that GameProTV was filmed right here in Sacramento?

924
01:06:58,084 --> 01:06:58,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it?

925
01:06:58,584 --> 01:06:58,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

926
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:08,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to say I read something that they used the Sacramento studios, that it was actually produced by the folks with the NBC station around here.

927
01:07:10,513 --> 01:07:33,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked that one because that was the show that first introduced me to a concept that they never really did anything with that I thought was great and I would love to see games actually do this crap and that was the save card for the Neo Geo where you could play in the arcade save your data on the card and go play it on your Neo Geo system at home if you had a game

928
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,574
[SPEAKER_08]: You could kind of do that with like F-Zero type things.

929
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:38,514
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember that?

930
01:07:38,894 --> 01:07:47,917
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's a little shady, but... But I think that bringing back that sort of format for a game would encourage people to purchase the home version, too.

931
01:07:48,657 --> 01:07:50,598
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, it'd drive sales, I would hope.

932
01:07:51,218 --> 01:07:51,538
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

933
01:07:51,578 --> 01:07:55,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to take back what I said earlier about GameProTV, because it says on IMDb they filmed it in Los Angeles.

934
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:59,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was just that they did a couple one-off shows, but I swear I read something.

935
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:02,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up with another popular gaming show around the time.

936
01:08:03,462 --> 01:08:03,582
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

937
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,802
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what have you picked for the masses tonight?

938
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:09,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I have picked Rival Schools, United by Fate.

939
01:08:09,924 --> 01:08:11,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to play the intro music.

940
01:08:11,305 --> 01:08:11,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

941
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:38,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you want to play the intro music, or you want to play the... No, I want to play some of the intro music for everybody, because this has the best intro.

942
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:40,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well give me a minute, because I've got to pull up the intro music.

943
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:42,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell them a little bit about the game, then we'll have the intro music.

944
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:45,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a fighting game, and it's put out by Capcom, and I love this game so much.

945
01:08:46,015 --> 01:08:52,862
[SPEAKER_03]: And the name in Japan was Shiritsu Justice Gakuen, which means Private Justice High School.

946
01:08:54,223 --> 01:08:56,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have different students that go to different schools.

947
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, intro music.

948
01:08:58,107 --> 01:08:58,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

949
01:09:14,759 --> 01:09:26,563
[SPEAKER_04]: The energy of youth.

950
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:27,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, tell us a little more about this game.

951
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:31,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well the other music I picked is my favorite level music.

952
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:37,607
[SPEAKER_03]: The version of this that we had in rotation for a little while was the one I ripped off of my PlayStation disc back in the day.

953
01:09:38,427 --> 01:09:40,928
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... It was, uh...

954
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:49,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it was a 3D fighter and you had a partner, but there were actually several students that would go out to the same school.

955
01:09:51,327 --> 01:09:58,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It was basically, there were students going missing from the different schools, so the students would get together and try to find the people who had gone missing.

956
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the arcade, there were...

957
01:10:02,191 --> 01:10:25,786
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually brought in two of the, actually one of them was one of the characters that had been missing and the other one was one of the teachers but they brought those into the home version as well but the game also had Sakura in it as a sort of hidden slash helper character who went to a different school but was friends with some of the other students

958
01:10:26,426 --> 01:10:27,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was pretty cool.

959
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:38,811
[SPEAKER_03]: You would also have, each person would have their own special attack, but you could save up your energy and do a team attack where they would work together.

960
01:10:39,111 --> 01:10:54,397
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some of them who had buff attacks where the cheerleader type, oh my god, she's so annoying, but she'd come up and cheer people on and you'd get five power bars filled up, something like that.

961
01:10:55,749 --> 01:11:03,213
[SPEAKER_03]: or Hinata would come out and, you know, grab your hands and go, you can do it, you can do it, and you'd get back, like, some of your life.

962
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:04,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, stuff like that.

963
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:06,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, other people would just have attacks.

964
01:11:07,975 --> 01:11:09,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, very cool.

965
01:11:09,656 --> 01:11:10,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Very bizarre.

966
01:11:10,677 --> 01:11:11,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely...

967
01:11:13,638 --> 01:11:18,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very popular, but I still sort of think it is more one of the niche fighters, you know, in my opinion.

968
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:25,441
[SPEAKER_03]: There were also different counter moves that you could do.

969
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:29,322
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in some cases you could block some certain special moves in a certain way.

970
01:11:29,342 --> 01:11:40,365
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd actually have attack cancels where you could, if you timed your hit just the right way, you could cancel out the other person's attack and then both of them would cancel out.

971
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:46,088
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are already taking some damage, it wouldn't, you know, decrease any of it.

972
01:11:46,329 --> 01:11:54,574
[SPEAKER_03]: In Japan, it came out with an extra disc that was called Neketsu Seishun Miki, which had a bunch of minigames on it.

973
01:11:54,594 --> 01:12:00,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got the minigame disc, except for the biggest notable difference about it was removing the dating sim mode.

974
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:26,306
[SPEAKER_03]: the dating sim mode was actually where you were a student and you went through a full year of school and you made friends with the characters and you did all this other stuff and then based on who you made better friends with determined what moves you would get so when your school year was over you could play your character in versus mode

975
01:12:27,666 --> 01:12:31,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And the moves were, like I said, they're based on who you were better buddies with.

976
01:12:32,008 --> 01:12:37,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was taken out, although I did, and I spent 90 bucks on this thing because I wanted it so much.

977
01:12:38,931 --> 01:12:51,477
[SPEAKER_03]: They released a version 2 that had the Neketsu Seishun Niki Mode 2 that had a more in-depth dating mode and had a DDR sort of minigame in it.

978
01:12:51,597 --> 01:12:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

979
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:55,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a dance-off mode in the middle of high school.

980
01:12:56,258 --> 01:12:56,978
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so crazy.

981
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:13,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I also remembered that the funniest thing about me playing through this, because I knew less Japanese then than I know now, was one of the characters asking you when your birthday was, and then when you came to your birthday in that part of the sim, he would bring you presents.

982
01:13:13,042 --> 01:13:13,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

983
01:13:14,841 --> 01:13:15,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cool.

984
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:16,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool.

985
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:28,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was an actual sequel, which was Mori Justice Kakuen, which we got as Rival Schools 2, pretty much.

986
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:32,806
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually had a customized character mode, but it was a board game.

987
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:33,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually pretty funny.

988
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had bitch fight mode, is what I called it, where you do the little slappy hand fight.

989
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:48,169
[SPEAKER_03]: But the characters in the game, there was Batsu, Hinata, Kyosuke, Hayato, Ran, her attacks were using a camera.

990
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:57,251
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Shoma, who used a baseball bat, Natsu, who was a volleyball player, Roberto, who was a soccer player, Nagare, who was a swimmer.

991
01:13:57,291 --> 01:14:00,852
[SPEAKER_03]: All of his attacks were so stupid, he wore a Speedo and goggles to attack.

992
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

993
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,611
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just so many good characters in the game.

994
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:06,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of my favorites ever.

995
01:14:06,792 --> 01:14:11,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I was really good at it.

996
01:14:11,695 --> 01:14:13,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, my favorite character is in the second one.

997
01:14:14,036 --> 01:14:14,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is that?

998
01:14:15,277 --> 01:14:18,639
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be this girl who kicks a whole bunch of ass.

999
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:27,124
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why I just... Oh, Zaki.

1000
01:14:28,204 --> 01:14:32,607
[SPEAKER_03]: She wears a really long version of the school uniform, wears a mask, and fights with a chain.

1001
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:35,485
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really fun.

1002
01:14:37,427 --> 01:14:37,767
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1003
01:14:38,268 --> 01:14:38,728
[SPEAKER_08]: There you have it.

1004
01:14:38,768 --> 01:14:43,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Your classic game of the week, Rival Schools here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1005
01:14:43,514 --> 01:14:45,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Very popular choice in the chat room.

1006
01:14:45,196 --> 01:14:48,379
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat room is blowing you kisses for that choice, and they approve.

1007
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you have it.

1008
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:50,221
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1009
01:14:50,601 --> 01:14:52,203
[SPEAKER_08]: That means we're going to take a quick break.

1010
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:54,105
[SPEAKER_08]: We've reached the end of Part A, but don't fret.

1011
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:57,929
[SPEAKER_08]: There is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come this week, those of you listening on the podcast.

1012
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:01,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Just stay tuned for a few more days, and you will get Part B of our show.

1013
01:15:02,054 --> 01:15:02,434
[SPEAKER_08]: See you then.
