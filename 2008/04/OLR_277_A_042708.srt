Tonight April 27th, 2008, the old classic game Splatterhouse is set to return

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Burnout Paradise is getting patched for motorcycle riding

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And are arcade ticket redemption machines a form of illegal gambling?

My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always to talk about video games

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and gamer lifestyle

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My BFF in the world, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hi

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How are you?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm tired

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tired?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Because of the sun

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tired cat is very tired?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sleepy Jamie is sleepy

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I know, it's very, we have heat issues here

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because obviously, you know, our show is based in Sacramento, California

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And we're just starting to get into summer

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I think it's only like 90 degrees out

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And yes, even though it's late April, it's starting to get into summer

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's what, 90 degrees out?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And yeah, it's getting very hot here in the studio

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And we're trying to buy more fans to help with the problem

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
83

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's only 83 outside

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hence me saying not even

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Lord

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, it's 90

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Oh, okay

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It was 83 last time I checked

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because I was going to say, when we get into June and July

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're going to have 105

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
However

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And I'm going to cry

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
However, the forecast says that it's going to be 83 on Monday

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And then in the 70s, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Huh

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, thank you for the weather update

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You know, people talk about the weather when there's nothing better to talk about

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But we have video games and other things to talk about

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right, Tech Master Loki, my other BFF

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Uh, yeah, how are you doing?

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm doing fine

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Good

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I got a large soda today because

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You knew it was going to be damn hot

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's hot

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It is very hot

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I'm mad as all hell because I bought a box fan from Target

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A 20-inch box fan and it's broken

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And it was cracked inside the box

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Like somebody else returned it

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Box fans aren't very, uh, complex

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know, just switch on, go

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ugh, makes me mad

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
At least we have the nice oscillating fan that is doing a decent job

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I think Jamie benefits more than the rest of us for that one

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, I do

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know what, it's not oscillating anymore

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's pointed on the back of my neck

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
God damn it, did that thing break too?

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I think when I tried to turn the ionizer off

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I think I stopped the oscillator too, so

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's going to keep blowing on the back of my neck

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll fix that

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I was going to go back and fix that while DarkSakura talks about her gaming week

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
My gaming week

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And just in time with the theme music

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's what I get when I don't hit the stop button

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Happens a lot here on this show

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I've had a very, very, very, very busy

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lots of stuff going on week

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I haven't gotten to play much other than Ragnarok

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I'm still trying to get a ZSNES to download

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that I can play, um, uh

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Seiken Densetsu 3

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And Dan was supposed to bring me back Mario Kart tonight

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I'm sort of like meh about it

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Because we've already had access to the game for like a week

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I'm kinda meh

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Although lately, like, I really, really want to play Street Fighter Alpha 2

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You just, you're going in and digging in the old classics

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you trying to find some new classic games of the week for the future?

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, I've actually been sort of wanting us to do our thing

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right, our thing

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I've been thinking, because we're actually going to be cleaning out the vault

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Because we're getting a roommate

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I was thinking, um, once all that's set up

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I wanted to bust out the Dreamcast and get on some Street Fighter 3 too

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You know, as well

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Good times

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And, uh, third impact on Dreamcast

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Alright

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of classic gaming in your future

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's move, I know, exciting stuff

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's move over to Loki and see if there's been a lot of classic gaming in his week

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, I played a classic game called Saints Row

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Uh, I don't know, it's not really that classic anymore

104
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Um, it's fun

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You know, we're still, actually we downloaded a new map this week

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Because we're bored with the three that they have

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So we wanted the fourth one, the fourth one's okay

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's been out for, what, years now

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But, you know, with the internet being blocked at our work

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I had to kind of jerry-rig something in order to get to work

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But, uh, that was all to just kill time until Grand Theft Auto IV

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Which I, uh, sneaked an early copy of

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And, um, what more do I need to see?

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've been looking for this game for, what, years now?

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Since Grand Theft Auto III?

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, probably since, like, you know, last Grand Theft Auto

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
San Andreas, yeah

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's fucking awesome, I mean

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's, um, there, okay, let me just

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Since the game is, you know, pretty awesome

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll just, you know, mention my gripes of the game

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't like the soundtrack, I think it's lame

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Um, I guess I've been spoiled with, like, Vice City and Grand Theft Auto III

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But I hate the radio stations in, uh, IV

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think they're crap

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Um, let's see, I don't like, um

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't know, that might be just it

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Um, oh, I don't like how you can't skip the intro in the beginning of the game

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because you have to, it has to kind of boot up, I guess, a little bit

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Um, before it gets into loading and stuff

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You just can't bypass all that little cutscene stuff

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Um, uh, oh, and I don't like the fact that I don't know any cheat codes yet

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because half the fun of Grand Theft Auto was when you didn't want to actually play through the story

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As you're cheating like crazy and just getting rocket launchers and blowing everything up

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I kind of miss that, but I'm sure that'll come out eventually once the game gets released

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
A couple questions, is the game worthy of the perfect 10 reviews it's receiving left and right?

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Probably, I mean, I don't, it's not perfect

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But, I mean, it's damn good, I'd say give it a 9-8 or 9-9

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But nothing's perfect

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Um, what is the most obscene thing you've done in the game so far?

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The most obscene thing?

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like, thing that is going to shock people like Hot Coffee

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Thing that is going to make Lord Voldemort

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And if you haven't been listening to our show for a while

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Lord Voldemort is our nickname for somebody else

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A very infamous lawyer in the gaming community

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What is, like, the thing you've done that would piss Lord Voldemort off more than anything?

149
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I haven't really done that much in the game

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I mean, there really hasn't been anything too controversial, I killed a guy

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And we dumped his body in a river, but

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I mean, well, other than the countless people that have been running over my car

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Um, I would say it's a lot more realistic

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So, like, you can shoot someone in the leg and they start hobbling away and stuff

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Um, and also, um

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, I went to the strip club in there

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And they have, like, you know, pretty explicit lap dances

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Of course, no one's actually naked in there, but, you know, pasties or whatever

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's pretty explicit, I mean

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They have, like, you can do three different lap dances

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
As it goes on there

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And one of them has, like, two girls, like, making out on top of you

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So I guess that's pretty explicit

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And there's a girlfriend you get in the game in the very beginning there

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And you can go in for hot coffee, I guess

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But it doesn't show anything

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And she actually screams, like, the weirdest things

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Wait, do they actually call it hot coffee?

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And the achievement, you get the achievement for that

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
For warm coffee, which is funny

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Um, I did see, um, in the video review from IGN

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There was a scene, I'm assuming from, um

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A hooker you can pick up, but it showed, like, a hooker, like, in your lap

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Bouncing up and down on you in a car

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So that's pretty explicit, I guess

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But nothing super over the top yet

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Um

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Apparently, I did get four stars one time

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
For riding a motorcycle onto the tarmac for the airport

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Apparently the police frown upon that kind of behavior

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm like, oh crap, four stars

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So, that wasn't good

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Um

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But overall, it's a good game

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Very, um

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Sometimes it can get annoying because the characters

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's a lot that uses that cell phone in the game

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And a lot of characters will call you to do different missions and stuff

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And if you don't answer the phone or if you don't do their mission

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They, like, you have, like, a percentage of how much they like you

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And that'll go down if, um, you don't do their mission

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So the game doesn't let you just do the open sandbox thing?

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Because one thing I loved about Grand Theft Auto was just, like, you know

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I didn't even have to pay attention to the story

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Not necessarily

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can do the open sandbox thing

198
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There's actually a mode on the phone that turned it into sleep mode

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And that'll turn all the, um, in-game, like, story stuff off

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then you just go and do whatever

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So that's kinda cool

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Um, but yeah, so, pretty much, just the radio

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The stations are kinda retarded on there

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can watch TV, which is kinda funny

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have, like, fake TV shows on there

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Nice

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Um, and

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know, that's pretty much it for right now

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's go to the chat room

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We always invite our listeners to come join us live and participate in our program

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We read chat comments, take emails, and phone calls later on in the show

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
First comment tonight from Sephiroth1215

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
After reading the soundtrack on wiki, the Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack does look like it sucks

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Too bad, cause I love the San Andreas one

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But, hey, I guess, you know, the best thing about it is

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Since it is on the Playstation 3 and 360 custom soundtracks, so

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Uh, earlier Loki said there's no such thing as a perfect game

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
J-Rod says Silent Hill 1 is perfect, to me anyway

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, it's not

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, yeah, maybe to one person

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And, you know, be honest, this is, it's the perfect Grand Theft Auto, I think, for me

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And I haven't even delved into, like, a lot of the online stuff yet

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Because, you know

225
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You can do custom soundtracks

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can do custom soundtracks

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So you can fix your major gripe right there

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, exactly, I just didn't like, cause I mean

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In 3 even, it had, like, some pretty cool stuff

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Like, they had a station that was all electro music and that kind of thing

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And that was really cool

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And, like, in Vice City, man, all the stations were awesome there

233
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's just, there's a lot of music that I've never heard of in there

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And I guess it's kind of cool that it's new and exclusive to the game

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But at the same time, I haven't heard of it and I don't really care for it

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tigerclaw wants to know if you've explored the comedy club area of the game

237
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I haven't gotten to a comedy club

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The only thing I've gotten to right now is, like, a cabaret club

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And that sucks

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Cabarets shit

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Do they have a burlesque show? That would be pretty awesome

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Um, I don't know if they have a burlesque show

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The one time I went in there, they had this really crappy magician

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The second time I went in there, they had some guy rolling around on the stage

245
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
With doing some sort of western thing

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Western monologue

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And then, you can, um

248
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
One of the first dates you go on is bowling

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So you can go bowl, which is kind of cool

250
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They have darts, you can do billiards

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They've got, um

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dance Dance Revolution

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They have a game that's like, I think it's supposed to be like Qbert in there

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I gotta go for another viewpoint

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Dark Sakura, any interest in Grand Theft Auto 4 at all?

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Why not?

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I just don't like those games

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They're not fun to me

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Is it not fun because there's no point?

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They're kind of boring

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah?

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Senseless violence not your thing?

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I like senseless violence, I just think they're boring

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I see

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I see, I like, I agree with Loki

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You gotta open up the cheat codes

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because the best part of Grand Theft Auto, at least the last one

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Or I think it was Vice City I was playing that had this

271
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There was the code that would just make the cars appear from the heavens

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And you could just make like 80 cars pile up

273
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And then fire a rocket at them and just make the biggest explosions in the world

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That was my favorite part, because fire is awesome

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
My gaming week

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You know, I kind of went and decided to go back to PSP gaming

277
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like, you know, I haven't been showing the PSP a lot of love here on the show with games

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And after my trip recently where I was playing Final Fantasy 1

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I said, I'm gonna go get Final Fantasy 2 on the PSP

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So I did that, I went and got Final Fantasy 2

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Which, you know, very similar to the remake of 1

282
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's high def, you know, pretty graphics

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Fun to play

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Loading times surprised me a little bit

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know if it's just because my PSP is old and maybe I need to get a mini

286
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But the loading times kind of surprised me how slow they are in some points

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But it didn't really detract from the experience

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's just that I noticed it, which, you know, says something there

289
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But the other game I've actually been playing a lot more of is Patapon

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I bought that game

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And it really was not what I thought it was going to be

292
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I expected it to be like a straight up music game

293
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And certainly music is one element of it

294
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But it was more of like a strategy type of game

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know how to say it

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like a, you know, basically here's the gist of the game

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
For those who haven't played it is that, you know, the screen flashes in rhythm

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like you'll hear a drum beat that goes

299
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Do, do, do

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And then you hit the drums, which are the buttons on the PSP

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You only get two drums to start, but you get more later on

302
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can, you know, hit the drums to issue commands to your little army

303
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So you might go

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Pata, pata, pata, pon

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And that makes them move forward

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Or you might go

307
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Pon, pon, pata, pon

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And that makes them attack the enemy

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So not only are you having to think about the music

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But you're having to think about, okay, what do I want to have them do next

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do I want to have them march forward

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do I want to have them attack

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do I want to have them retreat

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do I want to have them defend

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know, what do I want to have them do

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So, that was kind of interesting

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But, I'll tell you what

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The tutorial in the game, not so great

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Because it took me forever to figure out what was going on

320
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was like, why isn't my freaking army listening to me

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And it took me like a minute to get the hang of the game

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like, I think I needed it to kind of show me a little more

323
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Maybe I'm just stupid or old or something

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But it took me a little bit to get the hang of

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But then once I got in it, okay

326
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And it's kind of cool that you can slowly build your army up

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And there's that whole strategy of making the new characters

328
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And what you want to equip them with

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Or if you're feeling lazy, you just have the game auto-equip them for you

330
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think it's a pretty decent price for 20 bucks

331
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's a decent buy, so definitely check it out

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a good price

333
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The other game I've been playing this week is on Xbox Live Arcade

334
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I actually bought the full version of Lost Cities

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Which is the new card game

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And I kind of went into it with very low expectations

337
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Because I was thinking it was going to be another one of those games

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That was just very complicated

339
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Like, Catan

340
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Although Catan's a great game

341
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I just never got the hang of it

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And it's just too much for me

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Because I don't play a lot of those types of board games

344
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I don't have a lot of

345
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I think the easiest way to learn those types of games

346
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is to have friends that play them

347
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Because I think friends teaching you how to play those games

348
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Is much easier than the Xbox trying to teach you

349
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And so I had the hardest time trying to learn Catan

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because I didn't really play with anyone else that knew it

351
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And so I was thinking a lot of Lost Cities, I'm probably not going to get it

352
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But the card game is actually pretty simplistic

353
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yet, you know, one of those games that has a lot of depth to it

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So I was kind of surprised

355
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The only thing is, I'm not sure

356
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You know, when all's said and done

357
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
There's not a lot of difference between Lost Cities and Uno

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They're both card games

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
They're both, you know, they have the camera support

360
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They both are pretty quick to play

361
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Granted, Lost Cities has a little more of strategy

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But what is it? It's a virtual deck of cards, right?

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So I'm not sure why Sierra justifies the extra $5

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And charges $10 for Lost Cities

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Because there's nothing else there

366
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Like, you know what, unlockable art, woohoo

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You know, there's not a lot to really justify that extra price

368
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So like if I was a brand new Xbox owner

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And I wanted a card game, I'd go for Uno first

370
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But Lost Cities isn't bad

371
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's just, you know, maybe a little bit overpriced

372
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I imagine it's one of those games that's going to go on sale in six months

373
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So we'll see what happens

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I did have fun with it

375
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I'm going to try to play some online matches

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Although I'm sure I'll get my ass handed to me

377
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Because I guess there is more strategy in Lost Cities

378
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Unlike Uno

379
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
How can I describe Lost Cities real quick?

380
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Basically, you're trying to make numerical sequences from 2 to 10

381
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
On five different colors which represent cities

382
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And you get, if you are going to start building on a color

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You have to make a 20 point investment

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And you have to hope that you play enough cards

385
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That will add up to 20 or over by the time the deck is out

386
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, in addition to those, there are these multiplier cards

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That you can play first

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
They're called investment cards

389
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And you can double, triple, or quadruple the amount of points that you'll earn

390
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But you're also quadrupling the amount of points that you sacrifice to open up the city

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So it's kind of interesting

392
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Katamari's Forever says in chat

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Except Uno is appealing to housewives and school children

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And Lost Cities is for the Uber hardcore

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That may be true, but it still doesn't justify the extra price to me

396
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You know what I mean?

397
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It doesn't seem like there's

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Essentially, they're both decks of cards as games

399
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's just one has a slightly more complicated rule set

400
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That appeals to a more hardcore audience, I don't know

401
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Act Def says Strip Uno on Xbox Live with a cam

402
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, you could play Strip Lost Cities too, I guess

403
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm not sure exactly what the rules for that would be

404
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't need a webcam and an Xbox to play Strip Uno

405
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's true

406
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You could just have a bunch of people in the house and booze and then be naked

407
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's probably better anyways

408
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Real in-person naked is better

409
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Then you can see HooHoos and HaHa's IRL

410
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But there's some people in this world who shouldn't be naked

411
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And those are the people playing Strip Uno on Xbox Live, probably

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah, but they probably don't have pictures of themselves

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They're probably hired like a model

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Boobies

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I've got to wonder if like on XTube or Pornotube or any of those sites

416
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If there is like a taped Strip Uno game or something that's on those sites

417
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know why I have that curious thought

418
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But you know how I'm thinking of people using their webcams

419
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Like on Yahoo Webcam or whatever to do nasty things

420
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Well, why not take it one step further and upload it on the internet

421
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
For other fellow perverts to enjoy it

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm just wondering how Strip Uno would work since it takes so long to do one game

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Maybe it's like if you do a draw four then you have to remove four articles of clothing or something

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That might work

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Or you know, a draw two you remove two things

426
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That could be the thing is that if you get a draw four and play it on you

427
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Then either you draw four cards or you gotta take something off

428
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Like it could be a choice thing

429
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That might be interesting

430
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That would be interesting

431
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Not that we're encouraging people out of play

432
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No, I don't think it should be a choice thing

433
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think you should just have to

434
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Alright, anyhow, we better

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Gerardo Mo's laughing my ass off

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He says, Gerardo Mo says, I love Jamie's take on this

437
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
She always is here to give us a refreshing perspective from a female point of view

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Boobs are great

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Anyhow, that's our gaming week

440
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's get into housekeeping tonight

441
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hey, we got the Grand Theft Auto for Xbox 360 Elite Contest still going on

442
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And you procrastinators, contest entries are due next week

443
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I'm going to tell you what, we have not gotten a lot of entries

444
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't know if people are just taking their time because they want to make

445
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You know, they want to do a really, really good job

446
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Which I can respect

447
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So, you know, maybe they're going to wait until the last minute

448
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But I'm telling you what, you know, it doesn't take a whole lot

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And you could win a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And it's one of, I think, eight like rare Grand Theft Auto 4 custom paint job type systems

451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That was given from Gamerscore blog to All Games Radio

452
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let me remind you how it works

453
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We went over it last week, but I'll say it one more time

454
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We're going to have a bunch of people submit to us little radio things

455
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Like, you know how Grand Theft Auto has the little radio stuff in the game?

456
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
How is it in Grand Theft Auto 4? Lots of funny parodies and things that you hear on the radio

457
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Lots of funny commercials

458
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, what we want you to do is we want you to make one of those commercials

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But about Orange Lounge Radio

460
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And for the other shows participating in this whole thing

461
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Like, for instance, All Games Interactive

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We want you to do one about them

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Bobby Black Wolf, one about him

464
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You know, Video Game Outsiders, one about them

465
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And so on and so on for all these shows that are participating

466
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And if you want a full list, it's available on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and AllGames.com

467
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And yes, you can enter at more than one site

468
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But you can only be the final qualifier for one

469
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So we're going to pick a few that will be voted on by our audience

470
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And the winning one that's voted on next week will be the winner

471
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
They're going to get from All Games a $25 gift certificate to the All Games store

472
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And an All Games shirt just for qualifying for the final round

473
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And then they're going to move on to the final round where they will compete against the final entries from all the other shows

474
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And the community at large is going to pick their favorites

475
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And that will be it

476
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So one entry will win the official Xbox 360 Elite

477
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Based on Grand Theft Auto IV from GamerScoreBlog and All Games Radio

478
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And hey, there's also a second and third prize

479
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I didn't talk about this last week

480
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But second place is the Grand Theft Auto IV game for whatever system you want

481
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And that's courtesy of Mediaspective, one of the other shows on All Games Radio

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Third prize, $20 points card for your system of choice

483
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
From the Bobby Black Wolf show, the show that precedes us live here on All Games Radio

484
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So, 23 bucks

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And Loki is ineligible for the rules

486
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So you don't have to worry about competing against him

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Although he really wants it

488
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He really wants it, but he can't have it

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Maybe next time

490
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Sorry, Loki, them's the rules

491
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What can I say?

492
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Alright, so if you want to send in your entries, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

493
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Just use our general email address

494
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We're separating all the entries in another folder

495
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Or, if you don't have fancy MP3 recording stuff

496
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But you just have a really good idea

497
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That might be good enough to win

498
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

499
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Whenever we're not live

500
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

501
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You can do that either way you want

502
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So, there you have it

503
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So we hope to get some more entries this week

504
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And set people on fire

505
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Anyway, we listened to one today

506
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And I don't think we're going to play it tonight

507
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
We'll play it for you guys next week

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We listened to one today

509
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Somebody did it out there just for fun

510
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Because unfortunately he lived in Europe

511
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And unfortunately our friends overseas are ineligible

512
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Because it's an NTSC console

513
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He lives in Belgium to be specific

514
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And sent us a commercial

515
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I'll tell you what

516
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It was so funny

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I cried, laughing

518
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We should use it as our example

519
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It was great

520
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
For what people should do

521
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I know, but at the same time

522
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't want 10 copies of that

523
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
For people to come up with their own original thing

524
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Makes sense, right?

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So we'll play it next week

526
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When it's almost over

527
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And that way you can hear

528
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
A really good one

529
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And then we'll play the other

530
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Qualifiers for you guys

531
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Pretty soon

532
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Alright

533
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
NintendoManiac64 says

534
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Does it have to be MP3?

535
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, you can use AAC, Wave

536
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Well, Wave might blow up our inbox

537
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
As long as Adobe Audition can open it

538
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Or Winamp, we'll play it

539
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Just try not to blow up our inbox

540
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's all

541
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Alright

542
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's going to do it for housekeeping

543
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000

549
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And listen to some gaming news

550
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Courtesy of Loki

551
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So yes

552
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Part of a deal that

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
EA had with

554
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Milton Bradley

555
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
They will be publishing

556
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Monopoly

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
For the Wii, Playstation 2, and Xbox 360

558
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I think it's kind of funny because

559
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
EA is trying to get a

560
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Monopoly on sports games

561
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Oh

562
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Karma

563
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's funny

564
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Har har

565
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I see what you did there

566
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
But apparently this is going to be

567
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A sped up version of the original game

568
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
With some interactive minigames thrown in

569
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And

570
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know

571
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Doesn't really look like

572
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
There's going to be a PS3 version at all

573
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's Monopoly

574
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What can I say?

575
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That makes sense because

576
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Monopoly never ends

577
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
So there needs to be some type of sped up version

578
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean Monopoly can go

579
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean Monopoly does end I suppose

580
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
But it can go on forever

581
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm not even wrong

582
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I mean if this came out on like

583
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Xbox Live Arcade or something

584
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'd probably pick it up

585
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But it's not

586
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Like it doesn't sound like it is

587
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Considering it's going to be on Wii and Playstation 2 as well

588
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It really doesn't sound like it could be on Xbox Live Arcade

589
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It could do retail versions of

590
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I mean look at Puzzle Quest

591
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay true

592
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I mean anything's possible

593
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But I don't know

594
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Doesn't it seem likely that maybe that's not the route they're going?

595
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well it is EA

596
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
They like whoring their shit out so

597
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't know

598
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't know

599
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hey maybe it'll support webcams on 360

600
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Then you can play Strip Monopoly

601
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
How does that sound?

602
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Good times

603
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Not as much fun as in real life

604
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And if you play Strip Monop-

605
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Monop-

606
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Monop-

607
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Monopoly you'll just get bored and pissed off at everybody else before anyone's naked

608
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Monopoly is kind of boring after a while

609
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Strip Monopoly would have to have like lab dances

610
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
No seriously

611
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Because you know how you win all of your money

612
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But you have to have the option of being able to spend it

613
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
On getting someone to get naked

614
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Okay here's how you play Strip Monopoly

615
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Here's my idea for Strip Monopoly

616
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
You replace the chance and community chest cards

617
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Like you know

618
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The kind of stuff in there was like lame

619
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Like it was like

620
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You win second place in a beauty contest

621
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Collect ten dollars right

622
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Remember that stuff

623
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You need to replace those with x-rated things

624
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Like

625
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You won second place in a crotchless underpants contest

626
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's right

627
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Now it's time to show your community chest

628
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Luxury tax

629
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Luxury tax

630
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Anyhow

631
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So Monopoly's coming out on all those systems

632
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you think other board games to follow

633
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Can we strip risk in our future

634
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Well remember I think they were talking

635
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You know and they were also talking about making movies of these things too

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
So god I mean

637
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Battleship would be pretty cool I guess

638
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't know

639
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Board games have been around forever I mean

640
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
So much you can really do that's different

641
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It's been done like fifty times already

642
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Gerardo says in chat

643
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
There would be cheap hotels in Strip Monopoly

644
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You know what I would like to see as

645
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You get houses

646
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And then you have a by the hour motel

647
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
That you build

648
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah

649
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You know what I would like

650
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Oh that'd be funny Monopoly Red Light District Edition

651
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Or something like that

652
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I would like to see

653
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And this is

654
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't think this is Milton Bradley

655
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But I would like to see them do a

656
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Like Xbox Live Arcade version of Heroes Quest

657
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Remember that game was kind of like a halfway between

658
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Like a board game in Dungeons and Dragons

659
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh yeah kind of yeah yeah

660
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Or what was that other game

661
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
They had another game that was like something with

662
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Volcanoes or something like that

663
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And they had little marbles that you could roll down

664
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And they would

665
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Marble Madness

666
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No it wasn't Marble Madness

667
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't know

668
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Marble Madness had things that shot balls

669
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Let's see

670
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What was it

671
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh actdeft in chat said

672
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Risk conquer the world without your pants

673
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hey they were bringing out strip DDR

674
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
That made me think of pantsless rage

675
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Alright anyhow

676
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Forget it

677
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Now the chat room is just going to light up with

678
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Strip insert board game here

679
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's not funny anymore

680
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Although strip ants in your pants is kind of funny

681
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah they dump the ants in your pants

682
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And you strip to get them out

683
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Strip don't wake daddy

684
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Strip hungry hungry hippo

685
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Alright forget it

686
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Rob

687
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
What

688
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Rob

689
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
How about more news

690
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Let's move on and get away from

691
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Such a

692
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Such

693
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Silly

694
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Teehee

695
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Nudity chat

696
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
But naked is great

697
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Let's get away from

698
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Teehee nudity chat

699
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And talk about violence

700
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Woohoo

701
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And

702
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You gotta love

703
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
A classic violent franchise

704
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Called Splatterhouse

705
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
You remember Splatterhouse

706
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yes it was for

707
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Turbo Graphics 16

708
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Slash PC Engine

709
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Because the main guy

710
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Looked like a rip off of Jason

711
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I know

712
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And that game goes sort of annoying sometimes

713
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well guess what

714
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
On the latest cover

715
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Of EGM

716
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
They're talking about

717
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
35 different retro revivals

718
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
And right there on the cover

719
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Splatterhouse

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Sweet

721
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So Splatterhouse apparently

722
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Is going to be coming back

723
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
For a new

724
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
New wave

725
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
On all the next gen consoles

726
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Not a lot else known

727
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
About the game at this time

728
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But I suppose when this magazine

729
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Starts floating around out there

730
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
We'll know a little bit more about it

731
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Well

732
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It was

733
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
It was

734
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The story though

735
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Was fairly unique

736
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
From

737
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
You know

738
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The whole

739
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The story wasn't a rip off

740
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Of Friday the 13th

741
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Right it talks about

742
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Splatterhouse has an ancient

743
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Mayan mask that is

744
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Strapped onto its corpse or whatever

745
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Yeah

746
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And he has to go save his girlfriend

747
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
So

748
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Interesting

749
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He's probably already dead

750
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I wonder if it'll be like

751
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
A first person game

752
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Probably not

753
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Because they have the title character

754
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Right here

755
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But

756
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
No it's probably gonna be

757
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Another platformer

758
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well we'll see what happens

759
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
More details

760
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Butcher it

761
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Butcher characters in the game

762
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But don't butcher the game itself

763
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
We'll see

764
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Speaking of butchered

765
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Not really

766
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
For our buddies over in Europe

767
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They've got a date for a

768
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Super Smash Brothers Brawl

769
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And it's going to be

770
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
June 27th

771
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Also in addition to that

772
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
WiiWare will be out on May 20th

773
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So

774
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Put it in your diary

775
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It's coming

776
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Put it in your diary

777
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's what they call it there

778
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So I'm calling it

779
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Oh I see

780
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Oh

781
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I get the image of like you know

782
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
A little 12 year old girl

783
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Who keeps her diary under her pillow

784
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
With a little hello kitty key

785
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
That opens it

786
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We call them planners

787
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Dear Diary

788
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
We call them planners

789
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh okay

790
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Yes Dear Diary

791
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Today I pwn some noobs on Smash Brothers

792
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I beat the shit out of them with

793
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Princess Peach

794
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I want a pony

795
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The end

796
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Dear Diary

797
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Today I played Strip Clue

798
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It was Miss Scarlet in the billiard room

799
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
With my

800
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Never mind

801
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Let's move on

802
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
More stories please

803
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't know if they would consider that

804
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Concealed weapon

805
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But it was concealed

806
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let's see here

807
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So there's a company called Shadowbane

808
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
What is wrong with this show?

809
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's working with

810
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Nintendo to make an MMO

811
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And the question is

812
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They didn't really say what the MMO was

813
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
They were just calling it a

814
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
As yet unnamed

815
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
MMO project

816
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But people are starting to think

817
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Hmm

818
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Perhaps are they developing

819
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Animal Crossing for the Wii?

820
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Or is it just going to be another MMO that

821
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You know

822
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Just wait until E3

823
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I mean enough with the speculation

824
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You know what I mean?

825
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You're not going to find out any more details until E3

826
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Obviously

827
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Nintendo runs a very tight run ship

828
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Where everybody's mouths are sealed

829
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
And they can't say anything about it

830
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
You know no matter who's developing it

831
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So just wait

832
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I think it's inevitable the game is coming eventually

833
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But I think it would be kind of funny if

834
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Nintendo surprised us and didn't announce the game at E3

835
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But kind of came out of left field with something completely different

836
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And which

837
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
No think about it

838
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Would you really want an MMO for

839
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Animal Crossing?

840
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Yeah who's to say it's not a completely new IP?

841
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You never know

842
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Mario brother

843
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh Super Mario RPG

844
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Or Super Mario MMO RPG

845
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I don't know about that

846
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I don't know how you'd make that work but

847
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Everyone's like plumber class

848
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Or princess class

849
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Princess class you know I'd have to play that

850
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Or Toadstool class

851
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I don't know

852
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Huh maybe you're onto something

853
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Who knows maybe you could do something like that

854
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Copyright patentpending.com

855
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
P.S. money

856
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well I'm sure when the game is to be debuted

857
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Whatever it is the secret project they're working on

858
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
One of the places that you're going to be able to see the

859
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Clips and trailers of it first is the Everyone's Nintendo channel

860
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You know that it had come out over in Japan

861
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
It is coming out in the US

862
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It is confirmed this new channel is going to come out in the US

863
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
But it's just being called simply the Nintendo channel

864
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It will come out at some point within the next month

865
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
It's coming out around the same time as WiiWare

866
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Don't know yet if it's going to be the same day

867
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Or if it's kind of like around that period

868
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Here's the other interesting thing

869
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
If you play a WiiWare title

870
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
For at least an hour

871
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
And it has to be something that you actually purchased

872
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
From the channel it can't be a demo or anything like that

873
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You will get to review the game

874
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I guess your reviews are posted on the Nintendo channels

875
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But you have to

876
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think that's interesting that they make you play it for an hour

877
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Before you can review it

878
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But that's obviously a good thing

879
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
So you don't get a lot of crap in there

880
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You know what I mean from people just hyped about the game

881
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This game made my pants hurt!

882
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Exactly

883
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And anyone can read those reviews

884
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Of course this channel is going to be free

885
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And pretty much all the features that you've come to expect

886
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
From the Japanese version will show up in this version as well

887
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So it's just a matter of when this is going to show up

888
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
But sometime in the next month

889
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So that'll be pretty cool

890
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Sooner rather than later right?

891
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Now everyone's a critic

892
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Nintendo's encouraging it

893
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Well there's something else that

894
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Nintendo themselves is going to be criticized for

895
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What's that?

896
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Well there was a discussion going on with Iwata

897
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
That was after they've gone through all their

898
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
You know I guess financial meeting

899
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
That they go through

900
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Like any big company has

901
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And he's quoted as saying that their

902
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Projection for the year

903
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Is not based on hardware cuts

904
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And they are not going to need them

905
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
So translated from corporate to real English

906
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That means

907
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We're still making money so

908
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Forget it we're not going to lower prices

909
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I wouldn't think that they would lower prices anyways

910
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
They're having problems keeping enough stock

911
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You know for this

912
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Hardware for portables and consoles

913
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I mean the demand's not going down for any of them

914
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
So there's no reason to lower the prices

915
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That'd be stupid

916
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Oh we're sold out of it people just want to buy it

917
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They'll buy it for $700

918
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Let's drop it to $99

919
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Cause we don't like money

920
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Well there's more

921
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
So far they've sold 25 million Wii

922
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And they've sold 70 million DS's

923
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The sales are up 73% for the financial year

924
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
With 47.7% profit

925
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So that's not bad at all

926
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And there's some other news that came out

927
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
They're upping their allocations

928
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Of what they're going to be making each month

929
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
For the Wii

930
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
From 1.6 million units

931
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Being manufactured to 2.4 million

932
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
So hopefully that will ease

933
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
You know the retailers paying out there

934
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
But I don't think it's enough

935
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But they will conquer the world soon

936
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Soon

937
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Another franchise is hoping

938
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Wait real curious before we hop on to the next story

939
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
One thing I was kind of curious about is

940
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
What about you know

941
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We knew a couple years ago that inevitably

942
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The Wii's were going to come out in all these different colors

943
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Cause remember we saw the little you know prototypes

944
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
For the you know the pink Wii and the blue Wii

945
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And what have you

946
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Even though you know they're not going to lower the price of the Wii

947
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Are they ever going to come out with these different modifications

948
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Or is that something else they want to pull

949
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Wait to pull out of the hat

950
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think they're going to

951
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
That's something that you want to bring out

952
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
When the demand starts to drop

953
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Because people are like

954
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You know it gives them another reason to buy the console

955
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I don't think that right now

956
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Until the demand starts dipping down a little bit

957
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Until they start you know flattening out the demand

958
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Versus what they've got in stock

959
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I don't think you're going to see any of these new colors

960
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Or price drops

961
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Or any sort of like bundles or whatever

962
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Cause they don't

963
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
They don't need to entice people to buy them

964
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Cause people are already clamoring to buy these things

965
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So

966
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yeah it'll be a while

967
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Well one franchise that's making a return pretty soon

968
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Which is pretty cool actually

969
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Is Earthworm Jim

970
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
They're actually relaunching the franchise

971
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
They're going to be doing a brand new cartoon series

972
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
As well as some new video games

973
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
That are going to be coming to

974
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Platforms all over the place

975
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Including hopefully

976
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
PlayStation 2, 3

977
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And Xbox 360 and Wii

978
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And no word yet on

979
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
You know when this is all going to happen

980
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But

981
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Hopefully very soon

982
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So we'll see some more of Earthworm Jim

983
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Probably this year maybe

984
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Hmm

985
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Why do you think all of a sudden they want to bring

986
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Bring back this one

987
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I mean

988
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know

989
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Why bring back Bionic Commando

990
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Or Splatterhouse I guess huh

991
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I guess retro is all the rage

992
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So why not bring back Earthworm Jim

993
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I know that game always used to crack me up

994
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Simply for the fact that when you turned it on

995
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Like remember the title screen

996
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It was somebody burping the name Earthworm Jim

997
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And it wasn't a bad game either

998
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
It was kind of cute for a Super Nintendo game

999
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's the system I had it on was Super Nintendo

1000
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Was that one of the games that Tommy Tallarico scored

1001
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Two of the games he's kind of famous for

1002
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Good times

1003
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Well if you have never heard of Earthworm Jim

1004
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
And you've never played it

1005
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Guess what you're going to have the chance

1006
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
The game is coming to the Virtual Console

1007
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2

1008
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Are going to be somewhat soon

1009
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
There's no date yet

1010
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Going to be coming to the download service

1011
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But it's the Sega Genesis version of the game

1012
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Not the Super Nintendo version I grew up on

1013
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But the Sega Genesis version of the game

1014
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Which you know close enough

1015
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Is going to be coming to the Virtual Console

1016
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
By the way just FYI

1017
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Clay Fighter and Boogerman

1018
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Are also on their way out

1019
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Both also the Genesis versions of the games

1020
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Clay Fighter is fucking awesome

1021
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Clay Fighter is pretty rad

1022
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Although it's one of those games

1023
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't know for me like you play it for an hour

1024
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And then the joke's old

1025
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know what I mean

1026
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's all about Helga with her opera attack

1027
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
What about Frosty

1028
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Bad Mr. Frosty

1029
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I used to always play as the blob

1030
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That was my favorite

1031
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Awesome

1032
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Bad Mr. Frosty was great

1033
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Rama says the Genesis version has an extra level doesn't it

1034
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Not sure

1035
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Not sure

1036
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Well all those games are on their way out

1037
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So soon we don't have a date

1038
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But usually when these games are announced

1039
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
There's less than a month to go

1040
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
So there you go

1041
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Act Deft in Chat real quick says

1042
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Tigerclaw Tommy Tallarico is working on the new Earthworm gym

1043
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Or so I heard

1044
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Rumor alert

1045
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Rumor alert

1046
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Who are you

1047
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well

1048
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You know especially for those of us who are

1049
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Artists who probably found this really hilarious

1050
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But you know the deal with

1051
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
The Okami we cover with the IGN watermark

1052
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Oh yes the hilarity that ensued last week yes

1053
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Which is really funny because

1054
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't see why they bother watermarking it in the first place

1055
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
When it's actually Capcom's art

1056
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So it's sort of like

1057
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Oh we're gonna put our name on it

1058
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It's ours now

1059
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
No

1060
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Anyway

1061
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Because of this clusterfuck of craptitude

1062
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Capcom has released two new covers

1063
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That you can go on their website and

1064
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What

1065
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
No I'm laughing because I think this is just a stupid idea sorry

1066
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I just want the covers to begin with because they're pretty

1067
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
But if you go to capcom.com

1068
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Slash art redemption all one word

1069
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You can pick one of two covers

1070
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You can actually either get the original or two

1071
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Special versions that they have

1072
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
One of them is a completely painted

1073
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Green background with the wolf

1074
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And a neat looking other side on the back

1075
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And the other which I personally like

1076
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It looks like some level artwork with the wolf superimposed in the front

1077
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
You know where the front cover would be

1078
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And cherry blossoms

1079
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I like that one better myself

1080
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I can't stop laughing because the site was called what

1081
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Art redemption

1082
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Redemption

1083
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Redemption for who

1084
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And I'm wondering if you don't actually have the game

1085
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If you can just get one

1086
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You never know it might make a cute little mini poster

1087
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,000
You can

1088
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
That's kinda cool

1089
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh I think you can

1090
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But I mean it's just funny I think the thing is silly

1091
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Because honestly how many people are gonna do that

1092
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
When there's the more hilarity of

1093
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I'm doing it right now

1094
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,000
OMG I have the uber rare watermark cover

1095
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I don't know

1096
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Or even better you just get one of those and you're like

1097
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Oh hey look there's a game spot watermark on there now

1098
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
You never know

1099
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
But hey free game covers

1100
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And Jamie's ordering one right now even though she doesn't have the game

1101
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh VS Jason SV says they don't ask for a serial number

1102
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So yes you can do it

1103
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They don't and I'm ordering one right now

1104
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Nice

1105
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Can you order two? Can you get one for the studio?

1106
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
No let's you pick one

1107
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'll have to go order one too

1108
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'm getting the pretty one

1109
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Alright

1110
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The one with the cherry blossoms

1111
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'll get the ugly one then for the studio

1112
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But I'm gonna let my friend know who really loves this game too

1113
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Very cool

1114
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So there's some pretty cool mods that are out there right now for Unreal Tournament 3

1115
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Although this one seems to kind of take the cake right now

1116
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Super Mario Brothers

1117
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
They made a Super Mario Brothers Unreal Tournament 3 mod

1118
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And what it is basically is it's kind of like a 2D version of Unreal Tournament

1119
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But with like Super Mario Brother themed levels

1120
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
So you can run around kind of like I don't know

1121
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Super Smash Unreal Tournament

1122
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Or something like that

1123
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But it is available to download off of the Epic Mega Games forums

1124
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So check out epicgames.com

1125
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Check their forums and you'll find a link to

1126
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
UT2D Super Mario Beta

1127
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
For the PC and Playstation 3

1128
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So that's kind of cool

1129
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I hope more games support mods and we see more things like this

1130
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So and these are things I can download on the Playstation 3?

1131
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yeah

1132
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That's kind of neat

1133
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So what are the PC mods for Unreal Tournament 3 for the Playstation 3?

1134
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
There's a great niche for the Playstation 3 right there

1135
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I kind of hope they explore more things like that with the customizations and more games

1136
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah

1137
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
You know I know we talked about that when this whole game first came out

1138
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But to actually see kind of the you know

1139
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Metamorphosis of that is pretty cool

1140
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And this is only scratching the surface

1141
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I mean think of all the games out there

1142
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Like using the Unreal Engine that they did total conversions for

1143
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Made a completely different game out of the whole thing

1144
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I mean you're going to see some of these come out

1145
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And then you're going to actually be able to play these on your Playstation 3

1146
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So Unreal Tournament will essentially become like

1147
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
All these different games

1148
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Which is pretty awesome and definitely worth replay value

1149
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
So

1150
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Hmm

1151
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Very cool

1152
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
DJ Genai said I played that over at my friend's house

1153
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Good God

1154
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Alright let's do one more story here

1155
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
And then we're going to get into some release dates

1156
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But this could affect a lot of different releases coming out soon

1157
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
The Wii end user license agreement was recently updated

1158
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
You know all that legal blah blah blah

1159
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That usually you don't even read and you just bother to click accept

1160
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You know just kind of go through it

1161
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I don't know Jamie do you read every word

1162
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
On those end user license agreements

1163
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Huh

1164
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You know those things you have to click accept too

1165
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
All the legal blah blah blah

1166
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I know what you mean and my reply was huh

1167
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah exactly

1168
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Alright

1169
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Well the Wii just recently updated theirs

1170
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And the interesting thing about it

1171
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I mean I could read this whole thing but

1172
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You know basically the part you want to know is

1173
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Is that the Wii console and the Wii network service

1174
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Are not designed for use with any unauthorized device

1175
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Or any non-license accessory

1176
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You may not use any such device in connection with your Wii console

1177
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Or Wii network service

1178
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If you do it it's illegal avoids the warranty blah blah blah

1179
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So it's interesting that they updated this to specifically target

1180
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Unlicensed accessories

1181
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Do you think that has to do with the recent surgeons

1182
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Of all these fake Mario Kart wheel things we've seen

1183
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I don't think it has anything to do with that

1184
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I think if anything it has something to do with the Wii freeloader

1185
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Okay because I was going to say

1186
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I mean I think accessories

1187
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Peripherals it doesn't matter

1188
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Wacko tapes their Wii controller too

1189
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Exactly it's not going to hurt nothing

1190
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I see so things like the freeloader

1191
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
They're trying to go after

1192
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Well that makes more sense

1193
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Hmm

1194
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I wonder if there's other types of like

1195
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Controllers out there that help you cheat at games or something

1196
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I don't know

1197
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Well not in the Wii

1198
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
On the 360 they've got

1199
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Like I was telling you before the show

1200
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
There's those head in the game controllers

1201
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Where they've made custom modifications

1202
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That add buttons to the bottom

1203
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
They're remapping buttons and stuff like that

1204
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I need an NES advantage update

1205
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Let my NES advantage work with the Wii?

1206
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You know what

1207
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
They should come out with an NES advantage controller

1208
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You know what I mean there were the official items

1209
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That had turbo buttons and crap

1210
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
And even NEC got it right

1211
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
With the turbo graphics and PC engine

1212
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
That it had a turbo switch on there

1213
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That you could put it up to three

1214
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So I don't see what the big deal is

1215
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
With cheats or anything

1216
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Remember on the NES advantage

1217
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I think it was that one

1218
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
They had a slow button too

1219
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That was just the start button being hit really quick

1220
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You know what was great about that?

1221
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
What?

1222
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Shooting games

1223
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Like a life force

1224
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Unless every time you hit pause

1225
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It goes doo doo doo doo doo

1226
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And then pauses or whatever

1227
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And then so if you get that

1228
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Like it doesn't work

1229
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's horrible

1230
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You just hear that noise over and over

1231
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It worked great on like ice hockey though

1232
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That's what I remember

1233
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I still have an NES advantage out here somewhere

1234
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I know we used them in one of our photo shoots

1235
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That we did

1236
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I have one

1237
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It was fun

1238
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I also have a robot

1239
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Rob the robot

1240
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Alright well let's get to some release dates

1241
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Let's start over in the UK, shall we?

1242
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Okay

1243
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Stuff is coming out

1244
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Really only two games

1245
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
On the 29th they get Grand Theft Auto 4

1246
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yippie

1247
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And on the 2nd of May

1248
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Dream Pinball

1249
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Which I'm actually more excited about than Grand Theft Auto 4

1250
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And just a few other things

1251
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That are going to be coming out in the month of

1252
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That's pretty good is the

1253
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Pool Party

1254
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
No I'm kidding

1255
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's been listed rock band

1256
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Heading out, Death Junior

1257
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
The Iron Man game

1258
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
And Apollo Justice

1259
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So you have that to look forward to coming up in May

1260
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
For the US

1261
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We're getting Baseball Mogul 2009 on the PC

1262
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Toy Shop on the DS

1263
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Let's Yoga on the DS

1264
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Let's Pilates on the DS

1265
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Let's not

1266
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Let's Pilates on the DS

1267
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Brain Voyage on the DS

1268
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Great Wars Nations

1269
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
The Spartans on PC

1270
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And then let's see

1271
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1

1272
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
On PSP and PlayStation 2

1273
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Then we've got Iron Man coming out on Friday

1274
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
On PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

1275
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Wii, PSP, and DS

1276
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And then a couple smaller games here

1277
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Today we had Mario Kart Wii

1278
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And on Tuesday

1279
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
We have Grand Theft Auto 4

1280
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But I'm sure no one's really going to be paying attention to that

1281
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And that's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

1282
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
But what the hell is Grand Theft Auto 4?

1283
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Seriously, I haven't heard of that game ever

1284
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Never heard of it

1285
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Grand Theft Auto 4 is also coming out in Asia

1286
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That's a general release

1287
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I usually do Japanese release dates

1288
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But also some general Asia release dates

1289
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That are a much broader region

1290
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
However, I am most confident that it's not any type of localized version

1291
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
It's pretty much just a version of the game

1292
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
From the same one the US and the rest of the world is getting

1293
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I don't know if Japan is scheduled to get a translated version of the game

1294
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
They got one for the other Grand Theft Auto games, didn't they?

1295
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I think so

1296
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Maybe in the future

1297
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
But they got them way late

1298
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Yeah, they got them way later

1299
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Just like, hey, same reason we have to wait forever for JRPGs to come out over here

1300
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Same kind of logic, just in reverse

1301
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So honestly, there is not a whole lot coming out

1302
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Because of the whole Grand Theft Auto thing

1303
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Even though it's not coming out in Japan

1304
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't get that

1305
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
But there is, on the Nintendo Wii coming out in Japan

1306
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
ProYaku Family Stadium is coming out

1307
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
That's baseball

1308
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
This is interesting

1309
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Link's crossbow training

1310
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I didn't realize we got it way before Japan

1311
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But it is just now making its way to Japan on May 1st

1312
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
The Wii Zapper and Link's crossbow training

1313
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Yeah, they aren't missing much

1314
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Whenever you see the ProYaku, that's baseball

1315
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Baseball, well, who doesn't love...

1316
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Excuse me

1317
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Excuse me, ah

1318
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm dying

1319
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I get stuff

1320
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Live radio, Jesus

1321
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Nintendo DS, May 1st

1322
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
A bunch of stuff comes out

1323
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Most of it is just peripherals

1324
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
For instance, you can get a new shiny pouch

1325
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And a touch pen

1326
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
In all these different colors

1327
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
However, there are some games coming out as well

1328
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Emblem of Gundam is coming out

1329
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Fate of Heat

1330
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Comes out on the Nintendo DS as well

1331
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
As Anpanman to Asobo ABC Kyoshitsu

1332
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Anpanman

1333
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Anpanman is great

1334
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
He looks like bread

1335
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Well, he gets his own DS game very soon

1336
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And on the Sony PSP

1337
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Nippon no Asoko-de

1338
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I don't know if that's some type of like

1339
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Japanese traveler game

1340
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
It's coming out from Sony themselves

1341
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
What?

1342
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It means...

1343
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
What?

1344
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Well, Nippon's Japan

1345
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
No Asoko-de

1346
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah, that sounds like it would be traveling

1347
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Because it means go over there

1348
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah, it looks like it's like a

1349
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It shows you

1350
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I don't know, it looks like SimCity

1351
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
But it actually is showing you

1352
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Actual parts of Japan

1353
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
That's weird

1354
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
This one screenshot I'm looking at

1355
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Has like all these like power structures

1356
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And things

1357
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
So I don't know if there's a game in here

1358
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
But it definitely looks like it's using

1359
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Real roads and things

1360
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So

1361
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It looks like it could be interesting

1362
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Rob

1363
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But probably not for us

1364
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That's probably not something you want to import

1365
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'm gonna show you what Anpanman looks like

1366
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Alright, you do that

1367
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Post me a link in chat or something

1368
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Oh

1369
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, that's cute

1370
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I'm gonna link it in the chatroom

1371
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Because Anpanman's adorable

1372
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Enough cuteness, more gaming news

1373
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I want Anpanman

1374
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I wonder if they have any

1375
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Actually, Warrior Bob

1376
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Was over in Japan

1377
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Recently

1378
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And he like IMed me

1379
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So I told him I wanted an Anpanman plushie

1380
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Really?

1381
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah

1382
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
He asked what

1383
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Cotton game it was I was looking for

1384
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Oh

1385
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It's really cool

1386
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I thought it was very nice of him to

1387
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Make him come back on the show at some point

1388
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, speaking of the show

1389
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Which I should be paying more attention to

1390
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Instead of Anpanman

1391
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
There's details released about

1392
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Bionic Commando's multiplayer

1393
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
For anyone who is interested

1394
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Now that is

1395
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Excuse me

1396
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Only gonna be for

1397
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
For a

1398
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Offline play

1399
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
For Bionic Commando re-armed

1400
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But there will be

1401
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It will be presented in a zoomed out

1402
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
2D sort of mode

1403
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You know

1404
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Sort of I guess like the

1405
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Playing, you know, a lot of people in

1406
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Smash Brothers is done I guess

1407
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You have Deathmatch, Last Man Standing

1408
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
But

1409
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
They say the defining

1410
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Object is gonna be your Bionic Arms

1411
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You'll have

1412
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You'll be able to block projectiles

1413
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Grab power-ups

1414
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
You'll have

1415
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
You'll have that as your only weapon

1416
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
And

1417
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And then

1418
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
They're also saying

1419
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Is that they've

1420
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Made this 150 megabytes

1421
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Also for this size

1422
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So

1423
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
It's gonna have some stuff

1424
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
It will be Live Arcade

1425
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
PlayStation Network

1426
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And PC in May

1427
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Oh yeah and there's one other mode

1428
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That you have to go around without touching the floor

1429
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Hmm

1430
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm kind of excited to check out the new Bionic Commando game

1431
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
It's gonna be good times

1432
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
I should call that mode where you don't touch the floor like

1433
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Hot Lava mode

1434
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Remember playing Hot Lava in like

1435
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Kindergarten or like

1436
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Elementary school?

1437
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
No

1438
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
The hell's this?

1439
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It's basically you play on like playground equipment

1440
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And the ground is lava

1441
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
You have one

1442
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It's like tag

1443
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But one person is like the lava monster or whatever

1444
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And they have to stay on the ground

1445
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Where everyone else is up on stuff

1446
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And you have to try to tag them and stuff

1447
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Interesting

1448
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You're really not up on elementary school

1449
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Recess games

1450
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
You know what after the show let's go play Hot Lava

1451
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I know an elementary school here

1452
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Now

1453
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
That would be a funny commercial for our show

1454
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Well anyways

1455
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We had better games than that

1456
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
What happens when you take the video games away from the video gamers?

1457
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
We took it a step further

1458
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
When we used to have a game of tag

1459
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That would involve a hula hoop

1460
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
And we'd throw it at each other

1461
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Because playing like

1462
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
A game like Hot Lava or whatever

1463
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
With a very large piece of playground equipment

1464
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You can't obviously reach up like

1465
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
12 feet above you

1466
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But you can throw a hula hoop at someone's head

1467
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
12 feet above you so

1468
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That was fun

1469
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
We used to make up this game

1470
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
That we would play because we didn't have recess

1471
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
We just had an extended play period

1472
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Where we would take the hula hoops

1473
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And throw them and try to capture people

1474
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
But then we would also try to like

1475
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Drag them off and tie them to the

1476
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Tither ball thing

1477
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
It's like a twisted version of Pokemon

1478
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Okay apparently like everybody

1479
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Knows Hot Lava in chat

1480
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
You know what I think there was

1481
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
A game we played that was just like that

1482
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Except it was Sharks

1483
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I think it was Sharks or something like that

1484
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Where everything was Sharks

1485
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I want to say there was a Type A

1486
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I remember a tag game that you played on playground equipment

1487
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
But it was like Sharks I think

1488
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Wait real quick I gotta say this

1489
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You know we all love those playground games

1490
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
From when we were kids

1491
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I remember smear the queer did you guys play that?

1492
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
No I remember a bunch of us got busted

1493
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
What? A bunch of us got busted for playing that one day

1494
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It was something you played with the football

1495
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And you know whoever

1496
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Like had the football was the queer

1497
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And he had to run around

1498
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This is horrible I know

1499
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
You know the way things turned out

1500
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You know

1501
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
I don't wish to get smeared on a daily basis

1502
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Anymore but you know that's just

1503
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I think that's why we got in trouble for playing it

1504
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
We used to play soccer ball

1505
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
We would try to grab that person

1506
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And grab the ball away from him

1507
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We would put a tennis ball in a sock

1508
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And throw it at people

1509
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I'm not joking

1510
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That reminds me of that scene

1511
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
In what the hell was that movie

1512
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
By Kubrick the war movie

1513
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Full Metal Jacket

1514
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Where they all put the soap in the sock

1515
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And start beating the guy with it

1516
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Well the whole point of this is that

1517
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's sort of like crazy dodge ball

1518
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
If you get hit with the sock ball

1519
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Who gets to throw the sock ball

1520
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
It's pretty funny

1521
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Anyways back on topic

1522
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I want to say

1523
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We never are on topic on this show dammit

1524
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They need to compile a bunch of playground

1525
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Games into a game

1526
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I think it's been done before but not very well

1527
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I want to say they need all these classes

1528
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
But they need it on Xbox Live Arcade

1529
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And something like

1530
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Where everybody is competing

1531
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
To be the king of the school yard

1532
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Who wouldn't play that game

1533
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think it would be fun

1534
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
They should actually do a Simon says one

1535
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
That uses some sort of motion sensor

1536
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Or the wiimote

1537
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So it can tell where you're holding the wiimote

1538
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It might be fun

1539
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
That would be great

1540
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Hold on

1541
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I gotta get chat comments

1542
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Rama says the game I was talking about

1543
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
He says Sky that's called a blanket party

1544
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And now a highly illegal thing to do in the military

1545
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
A blanket party

1546
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Hey guys let's play beach blanket bingo

1547
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Wee

1548
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So Bionic Commando

1549
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
It's not coming to Virtual Console

1550
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Anytime soon

1551
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Because Nintendo doesn't want it to

1552
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And that's of course coming from

1553
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Capcom's vice president

1554
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Of strategic planning Christian

1555
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Svensson

1556
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Who basically says that it couldn't happen

1557
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It is up to

1558
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Nintendo to allow it to happen

1559
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Apparently

1560
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
The thoughts are maybe they didn't like the fact that

1561
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Hitler's head explodes in the game

1562
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Or the fact that I don't know Hitler's

1563
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
In the game at all

1564
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
He's Mr. D

1565
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
We need a fucking new

1566
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Castle Wolfenstein to come to

1567
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Xbox Live Arcade

1568
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And that would be the shit with multiplayer

1569
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Why don't they just rename him to

1570
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Smitler

1571
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I know he has another name

1572
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
He was Master D

1573
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
And Bionic Commando

1574
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
It was Hitler

1575
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
But he looked like Hitler

1576
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
You know how there's some cats that look like Hitler

1577
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And there's a whole website dedicated to that

1578
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
This guy looked like Hitler

1579
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Well he was in the Japanese one

1580
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Anyhow

1581
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Something that will be coming to the Nintendo Wii

1582
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
If rumors are to be believed

1583
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Anyway this is a rumor

1584
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It was a tip that was sent in

1585
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
To go Nintendo that Metroid Prime

1586
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Is being remade

1587
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
For the Nintendo Wii

1588
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Metroid Prime 3 was already on the Nintendo Wii

1589
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
But the rumor is that 1 and 2

1590
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Are being remade with all

1591
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
New controls and they will all be packaged

1592
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Into one comprehensive

1593
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Metroid Prime game

1594
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Like an ultimate box set

1595
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
If you will for the Nintendo Wii

1596
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Thoughts?

1597
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah GameCube port getting some stuck on

1598
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Waggle controls

1599
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
That sounds like the Wii

1600
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I know it just sounds like a cheap

1601
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Play for more money

1602
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
That would buy it

1603
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Metroid Prime 2 the search for more money

1604
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I was just thinking that

1605
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I wonder if they would go back and add stuff to Metroid Prime 3

1606
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
To kind of attract people that might already have it

1607
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Did they do that with Resident Evil 4?

1608
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
How about online?

1609
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
What?

1610
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Did they do it with Resident Evil 4?

1611
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Game to the Wii?

1612
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
No they didn't give it online play or anything

1613
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
They didn't add anything to it

1614
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That's right because they don't add anything to ports

1615
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You know what would be good Rob?

1616
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Is Metroid redone in the style of Metroid Prime?

1617
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
No

1618
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Don't touch Super Metroid

1619
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
No

1620
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Super Metroid is a god among men

1621
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm saying it not be

1622
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Of course the same game

1623
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
But I would like to see what some of those levels

1624
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Will look like from a different perspective

1625
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Because I want the music

1626
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And everything

1627
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The only redeeming thing they could do ever

1628
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
To Super Metroid is they could do it like they're doing

1629
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
With Bionic Commando

1630
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
And basically just

1631
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
HD version of the 2D game

1632
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yes please

1633
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
That's one of my dream games

1634
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Not an official OLR dream game

1635
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Not an official OLR dream game

1636
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Because this is not an original concept

1637
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
But I would like to see

1638
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Super Metroid given the Bionic Commando

1639
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Rearmed thing and then made like

1640
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Four times as big a new game

1641
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That is like four times as big the world

1642
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
It could go from planet to planet

1643
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
They could do that with the Wii

1644
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
If you're pushing just 2D graphics

1645
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Or whatever you can go pretty

1646
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Realistic with that stuff

1647
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I mean just do it like

1648
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Symphony of the Night or something like that

1649
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Just 2D, why do you have to do everything 3D

1650
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Everything does not have to be 3D

1651
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Rob, we need an OLR Troid

1652
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah but it's not an original idea

1653
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Neither was Symphony of the Night

1654
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Unless

1655
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Unless they replace Samus with a cat

1656
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Then it's an original idea

1657
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
A cat with a laser

1658
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Exactly

1659
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
That would be actually, I'd play it

1660
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
It should have different laser upgrades as you go through

1661
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Are you suggesting Symphony of the Laser Cat?

1662
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
It wouldn't be a Symphony

1663
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It'd be more like

1664
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Orchestra of the Laser Cat?

1665
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
No, cats yowl

1666
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It'd be, it wouldn't be

1667
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Operetta of the Laser Cat?

1668
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
It would be

1669
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Laser Cat Operetta

1670
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Okay, it would be

1671
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Screeching matchable laser cats

1672
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Chorus, that's it, chorus

1673
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Some comments from chat

1674
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Sephiroth1215 says

1675
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Metroid Prime 1 felt a lot like Super Metroid

1676
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Okay, I disagree with that comment 100%

1677
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Because like, when I played Metroid Prime 1

1678
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
For the first time

1679
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I seriously, I was like, what the fuck did they do to Metroid

1680
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And I threw the controller, like I did not like

1681
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Metroid Prime at all when I first played it

1682
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Now granted, I own Metroid Prime 3 now and it's grown

1683
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
On me, the series, but like, I was so

1684
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Mad that they raped Metroid by making it a

1685
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
First player game, because I was not so

1686
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Warm and friendly on the whole first person

1687
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Conversion, but when I really stepped away

1688
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
And just kind of looked at it as a new series, a new game

1689
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I was more comfortable with it

1690
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
But I agree, they need to bring back 2D Metroids

1691
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
So J-Rod says

1692
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
They need to go remake and import Eternal

1693
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Darkness, nevermind this Metroid

1694
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Nonsense, to which Sairan

1695
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Follows up with, somebody take over

1696
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Eternal Darkness is a good idea and give more games

1697
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Insanity gauges

1698
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
You know, well you remember what game

1699
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It was that I really liked at E3 a few years ago

1700
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Was that Call of Cthulhu game

1701
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Where you're, what you

1702
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Used to heal yourself was morphine

1703
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And it could actually end up

1704
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Killing you anyway

1705
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Because you would end up addicted to morphine

1706
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And then you actually couldn't

1707
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Do part of the game unless you let yourself go crazy

1708
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Drug abuse the game

1709
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Nice

1710
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Some more stuff, how's that

1711
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Anyhow, so the Metroid Prime trilogy

1712
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
May be on its way to Wii

1713
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But we would rather Nintendo

1714
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Just put the resources into giving us a new 2D Metroid

1715
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Of Uberness on the Wii, but we'll see

1716
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Well I'm very mad at Nintendo right now

1717
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Pissed off

1718
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Not up to F you pissed offness

1719
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
But Club Nintendo

1720
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
This elusive thing

1721
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
This, you know

1722
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Wonderful

1723
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Organization is

1724
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Out in

1725
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Australia, not in America

1726
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
For everyone

1727
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Who got their copy

1728
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Of

1729
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
What game was it

1730
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
It was for

1731
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Mario Kart

1732
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There was an invitation

1733
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
In there with a code on it

1734
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
That you could use

1735
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
To use that code and get

1736
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Nintendo star points

1737
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
The site is not active yet

1738
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
But you can

1739
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Get started on your

1740
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Saving up I guess

1741
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Hmm

1742
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Alright

1743
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Give it Nintendo

1744
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Nintendo just needs to give it to us in America already

1745
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Stop being hoarse

1746
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
I don't really know a nicer way to say it

1747
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Stop being hoarse, that's awesome

1748
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
So

1749
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Earlier this week

1750
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
It's not surprising because

1751
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
With a big game like Grand Theft Auto 4

1752
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Obviously people are

1753
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Going to get early and leak it to the internet

1754
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
As they did, but to commemorate

1755
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Such leakage

1756
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
The notorious

1757
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
BitTorrent site, the Pirate Bay

1758
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Is now calling themselves

1759
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Liberty Bay with you know

1760
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Niko Bellic

1761
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Of Grand Theft Auto 4

1762
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
On the front page there

1763
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
So that's kind of funny I guess

1764
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I love Pirate Bay so much

1765
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Wait a minute, should you be admitting that

1766
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
On this program? Yes, because

1767
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I'll tell you why I love the Pirate Bay

1768
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
They

1769
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Because of where their servers are located

1770
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's not illegal

1771
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
For them to have

1772
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
And distribute

1773
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Their content

1774
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
The torrent files Wait a minute, that's where you get your

1775
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Doctor Who fix isn't it?

1776
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Hmm

1777
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Okay, okay

1778
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Enough said

1779
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
But what's funny is that all of these

1780
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Different facilities will send them letters

1781
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Of complaint and you cease and desist

1782
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And so they publish them on their front page

1783
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And make fun of them

1784
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
And point out

1785
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
What they're doing is

1786
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Legal in the country they're operating

1787
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
From

1788
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And somewhere out there right now

1789
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Ross Steele UT is throwing something at his radio

1790
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
No one has been able to shut them down

1791
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Alright

1792
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Well

1793
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
But just because it's out there doesn't make it right

1794
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But it makes it awesome

1795
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And they're hilarious

1796
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And you know downloading import

1797
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
TV shows is nothing

1798
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I mean I don't think that should be a big deal

1799
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Honestly

1800
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
You know, if they've aired and they're gone

1801
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And you want to get them, why not?

1802
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Anyhow, especially if they're never going to air over here

1803
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You know, I think somebody ought to upload

1804
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
A torrent of all this

1805
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
All the old episodes of this

1806
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Or actually, they don't need to

1807
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Because all these episodes are online now

1808
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
This show is fucking bad ass

1809
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I remember this show growing up

1810
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It was a show, it was hosted by this guy

1811
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I think his name was Jeff something

1812
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
And he had these, I don't know, it's been a long time

1813
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Jeff, crap in the head

1814
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
He had these like totally 80's

1815
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Contestants would come on the show

1816
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And they would play actual arcade games

1817
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
For prizes

1818
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Now a lot of you guys remember this show

1819
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Because it was one of the first shows on G4

1820
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Back when they were actually about games

1821
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
They used to show reruns of this old show

1822
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Back when this game was actually on TV

1823
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I loved watching Starrcade on G4

1824
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And then they got rid of it

1825
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It used to be on Fox 40

1826
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Look, it used to be on Fox 40

1827
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
At like 10am on Saturdays

1828
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I remember when this game was

1829
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Or when this show was new

1830
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
But if you want to check this out

1831
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
And look at old episodes of the show

1832
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Starrcade.tv, they've posted like 15 episodes

1833
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Of the show if you want to view it

1834
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
And remember the prize

1835
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Which was the big thing about it

1836
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Starrcade machine

1837
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And who didn't want that when they were a kid

1838
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Dude, I'm going to email these people

1839
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
I'm going to email these people and see if we can get them on the show

1840
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
You know what would be great though

1841
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Is if they were doing it

1842
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I know this was before them

1843
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
But giving away the SNK machines

1844
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
With the multi-card

1845
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Dan and I still want one of those

1846
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I want to get them on the show

1847
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Because you know I've got to ask that question

1848
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Will this show ever come back

1849
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Will it blend

1850
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I know, well you don't have the rights to it

1851
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
You'd have to make up a new video game show

1852
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Whatever, I'd buy the rights to it

1853
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
I mean really, what are they going to do, sit on the rights

1854
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
It'd be called OL Arcade

1855
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
No

1856
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Patent pending

1857
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

1858
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Xenocore in chat wanted to clarify something

1859
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
About the whole like you know I said the import TV shows

1860
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
On torrents

1861
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Xenocore says, Rob if nobody in the US had

1862
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Distribution rights for a show, it's not illegal

1863
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
To share it online here, hence why

1864
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Fan subs of anime are still around

1865
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Since most fan subs stop their work

1866
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
When the rights are acquired, they are pretty much

1867
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Left alone, interesting

1868
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It's done out of respect

1869
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And if anything, and this also goes back

1870
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
To the argument of music and stuff

1871
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
If anything those fan subs probably drive up

1872
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Interest in the actual

1873
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Anime title, then when it comes

1874
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Over here, it would probably fare a lot better

1875
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Than say, if it wasn't fan sub

1876
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Dark Tetsuya and

1877
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
ActDeft in chat almost at the same time

1878
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Go OL Arcade

1879
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Instead of Starrcade

1880
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Well, definitely go

1881
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Check out some old episodes of that show and

1882
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Relive the past, because they did some great games

1883
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
On there, good times, especially if

1884
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You're like under the age of 18

1885
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So you probably weren't even alive when the show

1886
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Was first on the air, you gotta go check out

1887
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Some old episodes, which you were missing

1888
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
There was a time a few years ago that I had actually

1889
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Seriously considered bringing this back

1890
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
As a part of our station

1891
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
But, a little

1892
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Different to not get sued

1893
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
There was just that one show and I can't remember

1894
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
What it was

1895
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But it was, um

1896
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You'd have like a partner team

1897
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
And they'd go through this trivia business

1898
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And then they'd get to run through

1899
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
With these velcro jackets

1900
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh, I was just reading about

1901
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
That show on wiki the other day

1902
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I was just reading about it, somebody in chat will say it

1903
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It's not Nick Arcade, it's something else

1904
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
This predates Nick Arcade

1905
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Somebody in chat will say it

1906
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
But I used to watch

1907
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That show

1908
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
All the freaking time, and I so wanted

1909
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
To be on it

1910
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Video Power

1911
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Credit to Rama

1912
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And there was

1913
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Also GameProTV

1914
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Do you know that GameProTV was filmed right here

1915
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
In Sacramento? Was it? Yes

1916
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I want to

1917
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I want to say I read something

1918
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That they used the Sacramento studios

1919
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
That it was actually produced by the folks

1920
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
With the NBC station around here

1921
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Well, I, um

1922
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I liked that one because that was

1923
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
The show that

1924
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
First introduced me to a concept

1925
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
That they never really did anything with

1926
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
That I thought was great

1927
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
And I would love to see games actually do this crap

1928
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And that was the save card for the Neo Geo

1929
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Where you could play in the arcade

1930
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Save your data on the card

1931
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And go play it on your Neo Geo system at home

1932
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
If you had the game

1933
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You could kind of

1934
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I mean to do that with like F-Zero

1935
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Type things, you remember that? Yeah

1936
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I know, it's a little shady, but

1937
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,000
But I think that bringing back that sort of

1938
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Format for a game would encourage people

1939
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
To purchase the

1940
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Home version too

1941
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
If anything, it would drive sales, I would hope

1942
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
You know what, I'm going to take back what I said earlier

1943
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
By GameProTV, because it says on IMDB

1944
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
They filmed it in Los Angeles, maybe it was just that

1945
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
They did a couple one-off shows, but I want to

1946
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I swear I read something, or maybe I'm getting it

1947
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Mixed up with another popular gaming show around the time

1948
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
So, my bad

1949
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Alright, well, we're awfully reminiscent

1950
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
About classics right now

1951
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
What a perfect time for us to bring in

1952
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Dark Sakura's classic game of the week

1953
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It's a chance for us to pay

1954
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Respect to our elders a little bit

1955
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
The elder games, that is

1956
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Dark Sakura's going to sift through her massive archive

1957
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
And pick a game to share with us tonight

1958
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Dark Sakura, what have you picked

1959
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
For the masses tonight? I have picked

1960
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Rival Schools, United by Fate

1961
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And I want to play the intro music

1962
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Wait, you want to play the intro music

1963
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Or you want to play the... No, I want to

1964
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Play some of the intro music for everybody

1965
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Because this has the best intro

1966
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Okay, well, give me a minute, because I got to pull up the intro

1967
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Tell them a little bit about the game, then we'll have the intro music

1968
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Well, it's a fighting game, and it's put out by Capcom

1969
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And I love this game so much

1970
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And the name in Japan was

1971
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Ishiritsu Justice Gakuen

1972
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Which means Private Justice High School

1973
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And you have

1974
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Different students that go to different schools

1975
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Hold on, intro music

1976
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Let's talk a little more about this game

1977
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Oh, well, the other music I picked is my favorite level music

1978
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
The version of this that we had in rotation for a little while

1979
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Was the one I ripped off of my Playstation disc back in the day

1980
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So

1981
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
It was

1982
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Basically

1983
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
It was a 3D fighter

1984
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
And you had a partner

1985
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
But there were actually several students that would go out to the same school

1986
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Well

1987
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It was basically, there were students

1988
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Going missing from the different schools

1989
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
And the students would get together

1990
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
And try to find the people who had gone missing

1991
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
And in the arcade there were

1992
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Less characters

1993
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
That actually brought in

1994
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Two of the

1995
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Actually one of them was

1996
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
One of the characters that had been missing

1997
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And the other one was one of the teachers

1998
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
But they brought those into the home version as well

1999
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
But the game also had Sakura in it

2000
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
As a

2001
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Sort of hidden slash helper character

2002
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Who went to a different school

2003
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But was friends with some of the other

2004
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Students

2005
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
So it was pretty cool

2006
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
You would also have

2007
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Each person would have their own special attack

2008
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
But you could save up

2009
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Your energy

2010
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
And do a team attack

2011
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Where they would work together

2012
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
There were some of them who had buff attacks

2013
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Where the cheerleader

2014
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Oh god

2015
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
She's so annoying

2016
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
But she'd come up and cheer people on

2017
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Five power bars

2018
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Filled up, something like that

2019
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Or Hinata would come out

2020
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And you know

2021
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Grab your hands and go, you can do it, you can do it

2022
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
And you'd get back some of your life

2023
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Stuff like that

2024
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Or other people would just have attacks

2025
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It was very very cool

2026
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Very bizarre

2027
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
It's definitely

2028
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It was very popular

2029
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
But I still sort of think it's more one of the niche fighters

2030
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
In my opinion

2031
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
There were also

2032
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Different counter moves that you could do

2033
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
You know

2034
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
In some cases you could block

2035
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Some certain special moves

2036
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
In a certain way

2037
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
You'd actually have attack cancels

2038
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Where you could

2039
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
If you timed your hit just the right way

2040
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
You could cancel out the other person's attack

2041
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And then both of them would cancel out

2042
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
But if you are already taking some damage

2043
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
It wouldn't decrease any of it

2044
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
In Japan

2045
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It came out with an extra disc

2046
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
That was called

2047
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Nekketsu Seishuniki

2048
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Which had a bunch of minigames on it

2049
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And we got the minigame disc

2050
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Except for the biggest notable difference

2051
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
About it was removing the dating sim mode

2052
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
The dating sim mode

2053
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Nice

2054
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Was actually where you were a student

2055
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
And you went through a full year of school

2056
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And you made friends with the characters

2057
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
And you did all this other stuff

2058
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And then

2059
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Based on who you made better friends with

2060
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Determined what moves you would get

2061
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So um

2062
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
When your school year was over

2063
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
You could play your character

2064
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
In versus mode

2065
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And the moves were like I said

2066
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
They're based on who you were better buddies with

2067
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
And um

2068
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
That was taken out although I did

2069
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
And I spent 90 bucks on this thing

2070
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Because I wanted it so much

2071
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
They released

2072
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
A version 2 that had

2073
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
The Nekketsu Seishuniki mode 2

2074
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
That had a more in depth dating mode

2075
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
And had a DDR sort of minigame in it

2076
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Sort of

2077
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
It was like a dance off mode in the middle of high school

2078
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
It was so crazy

2079
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
But um

2080
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I also remembered that

2081
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
The funniest thing about me playing through this

2082
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Because I knew less Japanese then

2083
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Than I know now

2084
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Was one of the characters asking me

2085
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
When your birthday was and then when you came to your birthday

2086
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
We would bring you presents

2087
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Nice

2088
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
It was cool, it was really cool

2089
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
And there was an actual sequel

2090
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Which was Moru Justice Gakuen

2091
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Which we got as

2092
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Rival schools too

2093
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Pretty much

2094
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
They had

2095
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
They actually had a customized character mode

2096
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
But it was a board game

2097
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
It was actually pretty funny

2098
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And you had bitch fight mode

2099
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Is what I call it where you do the little slappy hand fight

2100
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
But the characters in the game

2101
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
There was Batsu, Hinata, Kyousuke, Hayato

2102
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Ron

2103
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Her attacks were using a camera

2104
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
There was Shoma who used a baseball bat

2105
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Natsu who was a volleyball player

2106
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Roberto who was a soccer player

2107
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Nagare who was a swimmer

2108
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
All of his attacks were so stupid

2109
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
He wore a speedo and goggles to attack

2110
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It was just so many good characters in the game

2111
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It's one of my favorites ever

2112
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Yes

2113
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I was really good at it

2114
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Although my favorite character is the second one

2115
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Who is that?

2116
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
That would be this girl

2117
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Who kicks a whole bunch of ass

2118
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I don't know why I just

2119
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Picked that over me

2120
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Oh, Zaki

2121
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
She wears a really long version

2122
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Of the school uniform

2123
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Wears a mask and fights with a chain

2124
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
She's really fun
