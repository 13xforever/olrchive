589	5151	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
5631	14295	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.
14775	26379	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
26960	27780	See you next week!
50396	59564	And welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, where we always start off with a ritual saving of Part B, ever since the Part B to that one episode a couple weeks ago was lost forever.
60265	62747	Tonight on the afterbirth, sadly, I believe Jamie is leaving us.
62787	65349	She has another commitment she's got to get to early in the morning.
65890	66510	It's called work.
66670	69993	She did will us a cage match pick, so we'll be taking care of that for her.
71955	74157	But first, we have another edition of...
77711	79293	Secret Club Secret Club Secret Club
94232	104398	Meaning that if you hear it here on this program, great, you're in the know, but you don't go posting about it to websites saying, hey, I heard it on OrangeLawnTrader.com or I heard it on AllAllGames.com because we're at this point.
104618	110261	We used to be that way where we were like, hey, you know, it makes our EP-ness bigger when OLR brings you the exclusive.
110541	113683	But then we got the smackdown that one time and it's just kind of like, you know what, fuck it.
113943	116505	We're just going to start Secret Club and start giving out secrets.
117285	118386	KONAMI TITLES
139184	150654	And this isn't a big surprise with each year seeing a new release of certain games that we'd be seeing an announcement for something that hasn't quite been announced yet.
152416	155879	Brand new DDR game coming to the PlayStation 2.
158181	160843	Although right now the title has got me a little confused.
161724	164306	DDRX or Dance Dance Revolution X.
165447	166248	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
178674	179955	Is it their 10th release, maybe?
180775	181516	I don't think so.
181536	188702	If you add all the games together from PlayStation 1... No, because Extreme was the 8th one, and then there would have been... Extreme 2, Supernova, and Supernova 2.
188842	189102	Yeah.
189382	189883	Oh, alright.
190383	190964	So, I don't know.
191524	194126	Maybe they just ran out of funky titles for it, I guess.
194146	194467	Who knows?
194847	197009	And then Hottest Part 2, of course, because, you know...
200010	202232	AJ Mix says X is for 10th anniversary.
202412	203132	That's a good thought.
203933	206354	Because 98 was the first year of DDR, hence the song.
206734	207235	Maybe.
207415	207995	There you go.
208916	209796	Props to you, AJ.
211357	213438	And then Lost in Blue coming to the Wii as well.
214859	215940	Lost in Blue on the Wii?
216400	218381	So I can be bored out of my mind on the Wii too?
218481	218781	Yes.
221078	223739	and then totally on a different topic here.
224439	234944	Got some more news talking about the whole... Remember a while back we were talking about the whole Gibson suing Activision and Harmonix for Guitar Hero?
235424	240866	Well, it's interesting because people were speculating, oh, it's probably over money or something like that.
242227	245368	I think this might clear it up and you'd be surprised.
246448	249570	This is actually... This was an email that we got from...
251496	260068	As you may know, Activision is involved in litigation with Gibson Guitar Corporation relating to the sales of Guitar Hero games.
260128	268779	In connection with such, Gibson has asserted to Activision that Gibson has the exclusive right to sell Guitar Hero games to music specialty stores.
270560	290877	Such as Guitar Center stores Although Activision does not agree with Gibson on this issue Until this issue is resolved with Gibson, Activision is requesting that its distributors refrain from selling Guitar Hero games to any music specialty store So that sounds like it's over money After all, and not some sort of patent infringement
291860	294282	Well, I think we all kind of guessed that, to be honest.
295043	297285	I hate to say it that way, but I think we all kind of did.
297305	302389	But, I mean, is this really a big surprise, brand new DDR game coming out for the PlayStation 2 this year?
302429	304291	I mean, what, there's like one every year anyways?
305252	306033	I don't know.
306433	306573	Yeah.
306713	308215	If that's a surprise to you, then...
309156	309516	I don't know.
330407	348933	but typically those games though, if I remember last year, Supernova 2 and Hottest Party came out in September and then the Xbox 360 one came out in November so it might just not be announced yet, that may be too far ahead but I don't know how well they've done
351394	353315	All right, now with that said, I've got to find a cage match to pick.
353555	354895	All right, yeah, you better look for that.
355536	358497	Well, thank you, everybody, for participating in another week of Secret Class.
358517	364159	Yes, I like sharing this stuff with you guys, but I like having a job, too, so please keep it that way.
364479	366380	All right, so we'll see what happens.
368581	370942	All right, I guess at this point we do get into the cage.
372372	375773	Thinking I might have one more thing for Secret Club tonight.
376173	378393	You should play this thing that we posted.
378453	382314	It's that Separated at Birth, We Fit Balance Board and Aperture Science Turret.
382634	384955	Oh yeah, I didn't want to do it because it was audio.
385515	386315	Let me see if I can get that.
386395	387516	Let me go to the forums real quick.
388136	388656	It was funny.
394077	396598	After birth part of the show, I don't have to be as professional.
396918	397858	Where was it here?
398478	400639	Here's the show role in the Super Secret Forum.
400659	401639	Let's see, it was We...
403709	403949	Deploying.
403969	406350	Target lost.
406590	408311	Are you still there?
408331	408751	Hibernating.
455778	458959	Sounds like just another stupid Wii voice to me.
460300	460640	I don't know.
460680	462081	I don't know if I see the similarities.
464264	464845	But that's that.
467348	470071	Okay, I can give you one more thing for Secret Club.
472483	478165	Super Dodgeball and Virtual Console at some point in the not too distant future.
478765	479745	I wouldn't see that.
479825	480185	Why not?
480265	483346	Especially with River City Ransom just coming out.
483566	488628	That and Super Dodgeball Brawlers, I think that's what it was called.
488768	491208	Super Dodgeball Brawlers or something like that.
491248	493489	That was coming to DS at the end of next month.
494529	494909	Makes sense.
495249	499310	I'm just waiting for that Wii Fit thing in that little high-pitched voice to go, Measuring!
499350	499851	Measuring!
500491	500951	Measuring!
501532	501992	Measuring.
502634	503335	Still measuring.
503916	504838	Goddamn, you're fat.
505459	506321	Stop eating, piggy.
507263	508786	All right.
509307	511090	Let's have ourselves an OLR cage match.
514414	527041	The way the cage match works, three songs go in and do battle, and the winning song, well, it doesn't go into rotation anymore because it's not our station, but it does win the praise and admiration of all of our listeners, and some type of consolation prize will come up with in the future.
527461	530823	Meanwhile, let's discuss the three songs doing battle tonight.
531083	533765	It's last week's winner versus Two New People.
534474	536896	or songs, I should say, brought in from OLR hosts.
537296	540718	Last week in the Orange Launch Radio cage match, believe it or not, I won.
541078	546621	And I won with a little band called Spray, who was famous for the song I Am Gothic in DDR years ago.
547062	555167	They did a cover of the song Run With Us, which was the theme song to the raccoons, but they made it sound like initial, or not initial D, Wankia Midnight Maximum tune.
555427	557348	Like imagine mixing your favorite 80s cartoon
557748	559630	Even though the raccoon is probably top nobody's list.
559970	561552	With Wham Gam Midnight next to the tune.
561872	562833	And you get this song.
562953	563974	So it's all kinds of awesome.
563994	565776	And the chatroom voted it as their favorite too.
565816	566997	It's song number one tonight.
567418	569339	It's Spray with Run With Us.
569379	571862	And remember, you only get a clip because it did win last week.
649261	652245	That was song number one on the single, which is available on iTunes.
652285	652866	It's awesome.
652886	654328	The Raccoons, Run With Us by Sprite.
664281	666763	Alright, song number two tonight is brought to you by Jamie.
666863	678151	Even though she's not here and sadly can't take your FUs either, so off the table until next week, she thought, gee, I had so much luck with Mindless Self-Indulgence the other week, I think I'll try it again and see if lightning strikes twice.
678572	680333	So she brings this song to you guys tonight.
680373	684796	It's a song called Shut Me Up, which we've managed to do tonight by her leaving early.
685337	687939	Shut Me Up by Mindless Self-Indulgence.
687979	689220	Here it is, song number two tonight.
864380	868445	Song number two is Mindless Self-Indulgence with Shut Me Up.
868465	871288	What'd you think of that song, Loki?
872370	872730	I don't know.
872890	874172	I've listened to a few other things.
874192	876315	I actually had the Blender CDs at one time.
878377	878938	It's okay.
878998	879879	Some of it's alright.
880339	882983	But I'd like to say it's a six.
886078	888681	Yeah, um, I don't know, it was okay.
889943	893707	Um, I liked her first, the other song better, a lot better.
893727	895169	Maybe it was because it was a remix, I don't know.
895189	896610	But it did have a, it wasn't bad.
896831	899253	I'd probably play that in rock band once just to say I did.
899333	901095	So I give it like a, I'll give it a six.
902028	906595	Alright, Loki, song number three comes from you, and you have to remind me what the file name is called.
906695	908237	I can't find it.
908277	911081	This song is a remix of a Daft Punk song.
911702	916729	It's Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops Edit.
917478	920721	And I guess it's sort of like a hardcore remix of it.
920741	922722	Like a little bit faster.
923843	925284	I don't know.
925304	929528	Not my type of music per se, but it was interesting.
929608	935753	If you don't like the Kanye West butchering of this song, then maybe you'll like this butchering of the song.
935833	936253	Who knows?
936594	939956	Daft Punk, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops Mix.
939976	940377	Here you go.
1141061	1145908	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Daft Punk, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops remix.
1145928	1146889	What did you think of that, Loki?
1146909	1149072	I thought it was okay.
1149092	1151215	I don't know.
1151235	1153198	I like Daft Punk, so it's a seven.
1154898	1157419	I thought it was okay too, but I kind of like the original better.
1157619	1160600	Nothing beats that Around the World song ever.
1160960	1162080	That song was the best thing ever.
1162401	1166282	Although the ones that did their live thing with those two songs combined together.
1166842	1167582	That was kind of cool.
1168163	1169523	I give that a 6 as well.
1169583	1172844	Alright, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in the cage match.
1173424	1176585	And it all starts with song number one, last week's winner.
1176926	1178066	You can vote for this one.
1178106	1180667	It's song number one, Run With Us by Spray.
1188760	1193086	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Shut Me Up by Mindless Self Indulgence.
1200256	1205243	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Daft Punk with Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, The Raindrops Mix.
1213832	1215873	All right, send your votes now.
1215973	1216714	Place vote now.
1216874	1223898	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we'll tally them up here shortly and reveal a winner.
1224598	1226720	Remember, it has to be chat.orangeonradio.com.
1227060	1229842	If you're in the all games chat, I guess you could still send me a private message.
1229882	1238046	I'll still count it, but we don't really tend to watch the all games chat just because having me watch three chat rooms between that and Justin TV is a little bit much.
1239687	1240328	A little bit much.
1241886	1242146	All right.
1243246	1245647	Loki, you've got to help me fill time here, buddy, while I count votes.
1245787	1248867	We have no Jamie tonight to read FUs, so help.
1249788	1250088	I don't know.
1250108	1251268	I was just looking at something.
1251428	1256369	It's kind of weird that our page got deleted so fast on Wikipedia.
1256509	1257329	That's what I'm talking about.
1257349	1258589	They didn't even bother to do a –
1271632	1275054	I don't want to do it, but somebody should recreate it from a cache file.
1275094	1277575	But I think the problem with the old one, it sourced nothing.
1277895	1282877	So you might want to source those YouTubes that have us on the news and stuff.
1282977	1284298	And I think we were in the paper once.
1284318	1285999	I don't know if you can still get that article on the internet.
1286059	1286419	I don't know.
1286899	1290380	Yeah, they did a speedy deletion, which is meant for stuff that –
1292362	1311125	Yeah, basically, you know, pages, I'm trying to see here To be honest, it's not that much of a surprise, but it does bruise the ego a little bit, especially when it's been up there for like two years Well, and this guy, I don't know what he does, I mean, he seems to be working on stuff that's mainly just like chemical warfare and shit like that, you know, those kind of articles, like
1311585	1322613	His were, like, you know, he did beer, there's some, like, different, you know, blister agent, blood agent, um, you know, Brazilian wandering spider, just, like, all sorts of random shit.
1322693	1328858	I don't know why this guy, just wandering around Wikipedia, oh, I don't like you, delete, you know.
1331000	1332021	Go delete his shit.
1332581	1332921	I don't know.
1335543	1336504	But, whatever, I mean...
1338519	1339120	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
1363151	1363932	Two weeks in a row.
1364512	1365213	The raccoons.
1365313	1366374	People love the raccoons.
1367074	1368435	Song number three was close.
1369736	1370577	Actually, not that close.
1370597	1372218	It only had about half the votes number one did.
1372519	1376182	Song number two kind of ate the dust of the other two songs, I'm sorry to say.
1376462	1378744	But that's what happens because Jamie wasn't here to really defend it.
1378904	1382667	And, you know, she can't tell you guys why to vote for it.
1383448	1385769	So that brings us to the very, very end.
1386730	1391154	It's just a fortune cookie message left, and we're going to call it a night here on All Games Radio.
1391880	1392881	and Orange Lounge Radio.
1393622	1398409	So we'll get to the fortune cookie message, but really quick, any last minute things we need to say?
1398766	1400407	There's no Justin TV tonight, guys.
1400427	1401887	Sorry, we don't have a game to show you tonight.
1402007	1402568	Maybe next week.
1402588	1404108	I left my Wii at work anyways.
1404568	1407630	They were wanting to see Metal Gear Online, but you're not even in that beta, are you?
1409210	1409891	I have a code.
1409931	1411051	I haven't tried it yet, though.
1411391	1417094	See, there was that story, and I forgot to read it, about people that were getting... They figured out, hey, guess what?
1417114	1420495	People are going in through the Japanese one, and they start banning people off there.
1420775	1423337	I never got an email, though, saying that my thing was...
1425051	1427574	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1445805	1446586	Something to do this week.
1447007	1452013	I still have to send back one of my broken 360s to get it replaced.
1452334	1457240	I bought a label online with the security labels, and we'll put it back on there and see if they catch it.
1458562	1463969	And then I have another one I've got to sell back because we don't have six people to play anymore, so I'm going to just take it down to five.
1465379	1465679	All right.
1468040	1478724	And then I've got to get two more copies of Grand Theft Auto 4 because I'm only going to have two right now at launch because I have my pre-ordered one and then my boss pre-ordered me a special edition that they're going to pay for.
1479964	1480224	Nice.
1481265	1482925	Well, it's almost 10 o'clock or 1 a.m.
1482965	1488707	if you're on the East Coast, so I think it's time to bury this show in the ground and say we'll see you guys next week.
1489287	1491008	Here it is, your fortune cookie message of the day.
1491668	1515498	I want to be the best, the ever worst, to beat all the rest, yeah, that's my cause Electro, Diglett, Nidoran, Mankey, Benazora, Tantor, Firo, Pidgey, Sea King, Jolteon, Dragonite, Gastly, Ponyta, Vaporeon, Polymorph, Butterfree Catch em, catch em, gotta catch more, Pokemon I'll search across the land, look far and wide
