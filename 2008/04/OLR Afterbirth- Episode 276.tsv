5000	14000	To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com, Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific time.
14000	26000	The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com, but were probably right anyway.
26000	30000	See you next week!
56000	65000	Tonight on the Afterbirth, Jamie has another commitment she's got to get to early in the morning.
65000	66000	It's called work.
66000	70000	She did will us a cage match pic, so we'll be taking care of that for her.
70000	76000	But first, we have another edition of Secret Club.
76000	86000	Here's the thing about Secret Club, and this is new for all games people, so listen up, here's the thing about Secret Club.
86000	94000	We tell you secrets, but the thing about when you hear secrets from the first rule of Secret Club, you do not talk about Secret Club.
94000	100000	Meaning that if you hear it here on this program, great, you're in the know, but you don't go posting about it to websites saying,
100000	110000	hey, I heard it on OrangeLoungeRadio.com or I heard it on allgames.com, because we're at this point, we used to be that way where we were like, hey, you know, it makes our E penis bigger when OLR brings you the exclusive.
110000	117000	But then we got the smack down that one time and it's just kind of like, you know what, fuck it, we're just going to start Secret Club and start giving out secrets.
117000	120000	So, we have some secrets tonight in Secret Club.
120000	121000	I guess, yeah.
121000	123000	Alright, so what would you like to share in Secret Club tonight, Loki?
123000	133000	Okay, well, this week, I guess, we'll talk briefly, as with every year and, you know, they got to hate us, I guess, by now for this stuff.
133000	150000	There's stuff that always seems to come out about upcoming Konami titles and this isn't a big surprise, you know, with, you know, each year we're seeing a new release of certain games, you know, that we'd be seeing an announcement for something that hasn't quite been announced yet.
150000	164000	Brand new DDR game coming to the PlayStation 2, although right now the title has got me a little confused, DDRX or Dance Dance Revolution X.
164000	169000	I don't know what the hell that's supposed to be, but that is slated for the fall.
169000	171000	DDR Extreme.
171000	172000	I don't remember.
172000	173000	The X is for extreme.
173000	177000	Is it possibly in this, I was thinking about this this week ever since you posted Secret Club in the Secret Forum.
177000	180000	Is it their tenth release, maybe?
180000	181000	I don't think so.
181000	183000	Like, if you add all the games together from PlayStation 1, is it?
183000	186000	No, because Extreme was the eighth one and then there would have been...
186000	188000	Extreme 2, oh, Supernova and Supernova 2.
188000	189000	Yeah.
189000	190000	Oh, alright.
190000	194000	So, I don't know. Maybe they just ran out of funky titles for it, I guess.
194000	195000	Who knows?
195000	200000	And then Hottest Part 2, of course, because, you know, the first one did pretty well, so, of course, got to release another one.
200000	203000	AJ Mix says X is for tenth anniversary. That's a good thought.
203000	206000	Because 98 was the first year of DDR, hence the song.
206000	207000	Maybe.
207000	210000	There you go. There you go. Props to you, AJ.
210000	214000	Yeah. And then Lost in Blue coming to the Wii as well.
214000	218000	Lost in Blue on the Wii, so I can be bored out of my mind on the Wii too.
218000	219000	Yes.
219000	220000	Right.
220000	228000	And then totally on a different topic here, got some more news talking about the whole...
228000	235000	Remember a while back we were talking about the whole Gibson suing Activision and Harmonix for Guitar Hero?
235000	242000	Well, it's interesting because people were speculating, oh, it's probably over money or something like that.
242000	244000	I think this might clear it up.
244000	246000	And you'd be surprised.
246000	253000	This is actually... This was an email that we got from our rep at Activision, actually.
253000	260000	And it says, as you may know, Activision is involved in litigation with Gibson Guitar Corporation relating to the sales of Guitar Hero games.
260000	272000	In connection with such, Gibson has asserted to Activision that Gibson has the exclusive right to sell Guitar Hero games to music specialty stores, such as Guitar Center stores.
272000	278000	Although Activision does not agree with Gibson on this issue, until this issue is resolved with Gibson,
278000	284000	Activision is requesting that its distributors refrain from selling Guitar Hero games to any music specialty store.
284000	291000	So that sounds like it's over money, after all, and not some sort of patent infringement.
291000	294000	Well, I think we all kind of guessed that, to be honest.
294000	297000	I hate to say it that way, but I think we all kind of knew.
297000	302000	But, I mean, is this really a big surprise, brand new DDR game coming out for the PlayStation 2 this year?
302000	304000	I mean, what, there's like one every year anyways?
304000	306000	I don't know.
306000	309000	If that's a surprise to you, then I don't know.
309000	316000	Yeah, honestly, the new DDR game, no surprise at all, though the title's kind of interesting, but that Gibson thing is interesting.
316000	321000	You know, DDRX kind of sounds like it could be a temporary name for it, but who knows.
321000	325000	What I do find interesting is that there isn't anything about an Xbox 360 version.
325000	330000	No, there isn't. No 360 or PlayStation 3 or anything like that yet.
330000	341000	But, typically those games, though, if I remember last year, Supernova 2 and Hottest Party came out in September, and then the Xbox 360 one came out in November.
341000	346000	So it might just not be announced yet. That may be too far ahead.
346000	351000	I don't know. But I don't know how well they've done.
351000	353000	All right, now with that said, I've got to find a cage match to pick.
353000	355000	All right, yeah, you better look for that, because look at the cage match.
355000	358000	Well, thank you, everybody, for participating. Another week of secret class.
358000	364000	Yes, I like sharing this stuff with you guys, but I like having a job, too, so please keep it that way.
364000	367000	All right, so we'll see what happens.
367000	375000	All right, I guess at this point we do get into the cage. I was thinking I might have one more thing for secret club tonight.
375000	382000	You should play this thing that we posted. It's that separated at birth we fit balance board and aperture science turret.
382000	384000	Oh, yeah, I didn't want to do it because it was audio.
384000	388000	Let me see if I can get that. Let me go to the forums real quick.
388000	394000	It was funny.
394000	398000	After birth part of the show, I don't have to be as professional. Where was it here?
398000	406000	Here's the show role in the super secret forum. Let's see, it was we fit.
406000	410000	Oh, it's like the very first story in the thing that Dark Tits.
410000	412000	They have two little things on there.
412000	414000	Kind of a genius to play the first one.
414000	419000	All right, so what is this? There's apparently a great similarity between the Wii Fit balance board and aperture science turret.
419000	422000	Okay, here's what the turret sounds like.
422000	430000	Deploying. Target lost. Are you still there? I've been waiting.
430000	434000	And here's the Wii Fit balance board.
434000	444000	Starting up. Step on. Ready.
444000	448000	Three, two, one.
448000	455000	Measuring. Measuring. Measuring. All done.
455000	464000	Sounds like just another stupid Wii voice to me. I don't know. I don't know if I see the similarities.
464000	467000	But that's that.
467000	472000	Okay, I can give you one more thing for Secret Club.
472000	477000	Super dodge ball on virtual console at some point.
477000	479000	In the not too distant future.
479000	481000	I wouldn't see that. Why not?
481000	485000	Especially with River City Ransom just coming out.
485000	491000	Super dodge ball brawlers or something like that.
491000	495000	That was coming to DS at the end of next month. Makes sense.
495000	499000	I'm just waiting for that Wii Fit thing in that little high pitched voice to go,
499000	505000	Measuring. Measuring. Measuring. Still measuring. God damn you're fat.
505000	507000	Stop eating piggy.
507000	514000	Alright, let's have ourselves an OLR cage match.
514000	518000	The way the cage match works, three songs go in and do battle and the winning song,
518000	521000	well it doesn't go into rotation anymore because it's not our station,
521000	524000	but it does win the praise and admiration of all of our listeners
524000	527000	and some type of consolation prize we'll come up with in the future.
527000	531000	Meanwhile, let's discuss the three songs doing battle tonight.
531000	537000	It's last week's winner versus two new people, or songs I should say, brought in from OLR hosts.
537000	541000	Last week in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match, believe it or not, I won.
541000	547000	And I won with a little band called Spray who was famous for the song I Am Gothic in DDR years ago.
547000	549000	They did a cover of the song Run With Us.
549000	554000	It was the theme song to the Raccoons, but they made it sound like initial, or not initial D,
554000	555000	Wan Gen Midnight Maximum Tune.
555000	560000	Like imagine mixing your favorite 80s cartoon, even though the Raccoons probably top nobody's list,
560000	563000	with Wan Gen Midnight Maximum Tune, and you get this song.
563000	566000	So it's all kinds of awesome and the chatroom voted it as their favorite too.
566000	569000	It's song number one tonight. It's Spray with Run With Us.
569000	593000	And remember, you only get a clip because it did win last week.
599000	605000	And you sing it in a quick sense, and it turns you down.
605000	612000	In the field of coming under, through your arms.
612000	615000	We got done with us.
615000	619000	We got everything you need.
619000	622000	Run with us.
622000	626000	We are free.
626000	629000	Come with us.
629000	633000	I see passion in your eyes.
633000	649000	Come with us.
649000	652000	That was song number one.
652000	653000	I'm getting ahead of myself.
653000	657000	The song is called Run With Us, the Michael Trend filled radio edit, technically that is,
657000	661000	but it's song number one on the single, which is available on iTunes.
661000	662000	It's awesome.
662000	664000	The Raccoons, Run With Us by Spray.
664000	667000	All right, song number two tonight is brought to you by Jamie.
667000	670000	Even though she's not here and sadly can't take your FUs either,
670000	672000	so off the table into next week.
672000	676000	She thought, gee, I had so much luck with mindless self-indulgence the other week.
676000	679000	I think I'll try it again and see if lightning strikes twice.
679000	681000	So she brings this song to you guys tonight.
681000	685000	It's called Shut Me Up, which we've managed to do tonight by her leaving early.
685000	688000	Shut Me Up by Mindless Self-Indulgence.
688000	712000	Here it is, song number two tonight.
712000	719000	I can't wait for you to fuck me up in a minute, minute, in a fucking minute.
719000	724000	I can't wait for you to fuck me up in a minute, minute, in a second.
724000	744000	I can't wait for you to shut me up and make me hit my bad ass.
