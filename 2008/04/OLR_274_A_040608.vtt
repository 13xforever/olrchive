The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, and not necessarily those of Douglas

00:18.360 --> 00:36.720
O'Brien, the author of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.320
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

00:41.320 --> 00:43.160
and the gamer lifestyle.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.080
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.120
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.120
Hi.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.120
How are you doing?

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
Hi.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120
Okay.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.120
I'm doing okay.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.120
Good.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.840
Say hello, as well, to Tech Master Loki.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.840
Hello.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
How are you doing?

01:00.840 --> 01:01.840
I'm doing okay.

01:01.840 --> 01:02.840
All right.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.680
I'm glad to hear you're okay and not crappy.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
I'm not crappy.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
All right.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Good.

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
We were going to have some guests tonight.

01:08.680 --> 01:13.320
Actually, I invited... Well, it was very last minute.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.880
I was out most of the week, as some of you have heard.

01:15.880 --> 01:21.320
I'll get into that later, but I invited guests from the past, because tonight is the last

01:21.320 --> 01:22.640
show on Live 365.

01:22.640 --> 01:29.040
I invited a bunch of guests from the past to come tonight to say goodbye to Live 365,

01:29.040 --> 01:30.040
and no one's here.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.040
I don't want to say goodbye.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.040
You know what I want to say?

01:33.040 --> 01:34.040
What?

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
Fuck you.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.400
Well, I sent the official cancellation notice today, so there's no turning back now.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.400
It's a done deal.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.400
They're bastards.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.400
Oh, I know.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.640
They shouldn't have upped the rates, but oh well.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
It's done.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.800
If you don't know the latest yet, go back and listen to last week's show.

01:49.800 --> 01:55.760
Again, starting next week, April the 13th, we are now going to be on allgames.com.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.000
For those of you guys that listen to the podcast, which is most of you listen to this in podcast

02:00.000 --> 02:04.560
form only, not the live stream, you're really not going to have to change a damn thing,

02:04.560 --> 02:06.640
because the podcast feed will stay the same.

02:06.640 --> 02:09.840
The shows are going to go to the same place.

02:09.840 --> 02:13.840
Not a lot's going to change for you, except some aesthetic things.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.680
We might try some different sound qualities and so on, but nothing that's really going

02:17.680 --> 02:19.920
to shake things up too much.

02:19.920 --> 02:24.400
But for the live folks, this is a big deal, because we have some folks that have been

02:24.400 --> 02:28.220
here every freaking night practically for the past five and a half years.

02:28.220 --> 02:29.220
That's a lot.

02:29.220 --> 02:34.240
So it's a big change for some people, like Dark Tetsuya I know is here, episode one.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.520
He's still here tonight.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.560
Drew is supposed to be in studio tonight.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.560
I don't know why he's not here yet.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.280
He might be just running late.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.960
He was also here for episode one, so we have a lot of people that maybe weren't here for

02:44.960 --> 02:48.040
episode one, but joined us somewhere along the way.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.320
So it's a big change for our live listeners.

02:50.320 --> 02:55.240
Anyhow, let's go ahead and start off tonight's show, as we always do with How Was Your Gaming

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
Week?

02:56.240 --> 02:57.240
Dark Sakura, we'll start off with you.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
How was your gaming week?

02:58.240 --> 03:07.000
It was Ragnarokan, as usual, and we have started working on cleaning up the pinball machines,

03:07.000 --> 03:10.880
because Dan's having a pinball party next Sunday.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.440
That sounds like fun, a pinball party, huh?

03:12.440 --> 03:15.640
We're having a bunch of people over at the house, it's like, everybody wants to meet

03:15.640 --> 03:16.640
you.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.640
It's like, well, too bad.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.440
What exactly happens at a pinball party?

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Pizza and pinball.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
Oh, okay.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
Sounds pretty good.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.760
And then people talk about their collections and stuff, it's just like, look how pretty

03:28.760 --> 03:30.120
my pinball tables are.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.360
Are people actually going to bring pinball tables over?

03:32.360 --> 03:33.360
No.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.360
Okay, I was going to say, they're not very portable.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.360
No, but we have plenty, I think.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.360
Are you going to do...

03:37.360 --> 03:38.360
Well, here's my question.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.960
Are you going to have not just the pinball machines, but maybe, like, pinball FX on the

03:41.960 --> 03:46.800
TV, on Xbox Live?

03:46.800 --> 03:47.800
I don't know.

03:47.800 --> 03:48.800
You know what you can do on Xbox Live?

03:48.800 --> 03:49.800
Shit.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
You can do shit.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.480
I was going to suggest that he hook up the Nintendo and put in Pinbot.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.480
Ah, there you go.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.360
And maybe we can hook up the TurboGrafx and put in Devil's Crush.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.760
Oh, okay, good idea.

04:01.760 --> 04:10.080
And he picked up one of those classic collections, too, like the whatever super awesome of pinball.

04:10.080 --> 04:15.000
And to Shadow Siler, I play on Essence RO, but you won't ever find me.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.760
I haven't made the guild yet.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.760
How about Sonic Spinball?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.480
I could do that.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
I've got Sonic Spinball.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.600
Because that was a very strange pinball game.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.560
It reminded me of that part of Casino Night where I'd get stuck and get pissed off.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.240
So that's what that game always reminded me of.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.360
Gotcha.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.640
We always welcome our chatters.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.380
They're here with us every week.

04:35.380 --> 04:39.560
This last Live 365 show is no exception, and we'll still be in the same chat room next

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
week.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.000
That's an important note.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.120
At this time, we're not going to be switching to the all-games chat.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.160
I don't know if we will in the future.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.960
We're doing baby steps right now, so we're still going to have the Orange Launch chat

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
next week.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.400
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

04:54.400 --> 04:59.120
Comment from Shadow Siler says, DarkSakura, which server do you Ragnarok on?

04:59.120 --> 05:02.880
That's what I answered when you said that I play on the Essence server.

05:02.880 --> 05:03.880
I'm sorry.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
I was on crack.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.560
Canty says, How many pinball machines does DarkSakura have?

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
Okay.

05:08.560 --> 05:11.280
Now, I have to think about which ones are actually mine, because we're holding some

05:11.280 --> 05:12.280
for some people.

05:12.280 --> 05:17.360
So the ones that we're holding is a Brite of Pinbot, an Indiana Jones that Dan is shopping

05:17.360 --> 05:18.660
out.

05:18.660 --> 05:25.640
We are holding a Back to the Future and a Black Knight, not Black Knight 2000.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.640
I wish I had that one.

05:27.640 --> 05:32.760
And then for ours, we have Star Trek The Next Generation.

05:32.760 --> 05:43.720
We have No Fear, Twilight Zone, Simpsons Pinball Party, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and

05:43.720 --> 05:45.880
my machine, World Cup Soccer 94.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.840
Did I say Twilight Zone?

05:48.840 --> 05:51.160
Yeah, we have Twilight Zone.

05:51.160 --> 05:52.160
All right.

05:52.160 --> 05:56.680
It seems like things have changed a lot since the last time even I was over there.

05:56.680 --> 05:57.680
That's crazy.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.680
All right.

05:58.680 --> 06:02.520
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:02.520 --> 06:04.520
As he sits down, ready to go.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.120
My gaming week was pretty brief.

06:08.120 --> 06:15.680
I played pretty much just Saints Row this entire week, I think, yes.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.840
But it's finished now, so that's good.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.720
And well, I'm still not 100% in the game because I have to do all the damn activities and some

06:23.720 --> 06:28.520
of them are fucking impossible, but as far as the story goes, I'm done.

06:28.520 --> 06:33.840
I already knew what the ending was anyway, so I'm glad I'm done so I can start Saints

06:33.840 --> 06:39.160
Row 2 when that comes out in Grand Theft Auto IV and all that fun stuff.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.160
That's it.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
Wow.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
That's a relatively short week for you.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.760
Well, I played a lot of Saints Row.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.360
I mean, we played the death matches during lunch.

06:46.360 --> 06:51.080
I had a funny moment where I was driving on the sky in Saints Row because the game is

06:51.080 --> 06:52.920
a little glitchy sometimes.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.840
So that was fun.

06:54.840 --> 06:59.280
And well, that's about it.

06:59.280 --> 07:03.400
I didn't play a lot this week, but I did have enough time to beat a game.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.400
That's right.

07:04.400 --> 07:07.960
I beat a game from start to finish, which I haven't done in quite a long time.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.360
And the game that I beat was You Have to Burn the Rope.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.360
I don't know if you've seen this game yet, but it's got hilarious music.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.760
It's stupid but funny, you know, one of those stupid funny things.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.400
So obviously, don't take that too seriously.

07:20.400 --> 07:23.520
The game takes like a minute and a half to beat.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.400
And then, let's see, besides that, really not a lot.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.600
I played Mr. Driller for like 10 minutes.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.680
The new one on Xbox Live Arcade.

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
I'm sorry.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.920
Well, yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.

07:36.920 --> 07:41.120
I wonder what version they ported because I was surprised to see, and maybe it's just

07:41.120 --> 07:45.680
because of the mechanics of the game or whatever, but I was surprised to see that the playing

07:45.680 --> 07:48.320
field was only a really small portion of the screen.

07:48.320 --> 07:51.080
I don't know if maybe that's to support the multiplayer or what have you.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.440
Did you get to play online?

07:52.440 --> 07:53.560
Which is probably a lot more fun.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.840
No, I'm completely basing my judgment off the demo.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.800
Oh, good, because if you played online, you'd be like, this game is shit.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.800
Why?

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
Did you play it online?

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
Well, the online is all broken.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
It's completely broken.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.240
If you're hosting the game, you have no problem, but other people that are playing with you,

08:07.240 --> 08:08.680
they can't drill down.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.480
They'll start drilling down and they'll pop back up, and they'll start drilling down and

08:11.480 --> 08:12.480
they'll pop back up.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.480
Nice.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.360
There's so much lag in it, it actually goes in reverse sometimes.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.520
So yeah, I didn't play a lot of games this week, but I have a valid excuse, so I'll talk

08:19.520 --> 08:22.920
about this real quick because a lot of people have been asking.

08:22.920 --> 08:27.680
The reason why Part B went up on Saturday this week, which is extremely late for Part

08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
B to go up.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.400
We tried to get it up on Wednesday, like Thursday at the absolute latest if I had something

08:31.400 --> 08:32.400
going on.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.840
I was in the hospital for three days this week, and it was mentioned on orangeontraday.com,

08:36.840 --> 08:41.760
you probably saw that, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.480
I don't know how much I've mentioned it on the live show, but I've been having abdominal

08:46.480 --> 08:52.480
pains on and off for the past three weeks, and finally it kind of reached a head on Wednesday.

08:52.480 --> 08:57.400
I got woken up by some horrendous chest pain, and it was like, like, alien is going to pop

08:57.400 --> 08:59.480
out of my chest, you know, bad.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.320
So I finally just went to the ER.

09:01.320 --> 09:05.400
I was kind of getting the runaround from my doctors, you know, like, they had diagnosed

09:05.400 --> 09:09.160
me with pancreatitis, but didn't seem to be doing much about it, and finally I had to

09:09.160 --> 09:10.160
go to the hospital.

09:10.160 --> 09:16.640
So, yeah, that's where I spent about three days, pretty much, because what I had was

09:16.640 --> 09:21.660
acute pancreatitis, basically my pancreas is fucked up, and it was producing too much

09:21.660 --> 09:25.080
of a certain chemical, and it makes it really painful to eat fatty foods.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.480
It most commonly happens, funny enough, it most commonly happens in lushes.

09:29.480 --> 09:33.720
You know, people who drink a lot, alcoholics, like 80% of the cases are alcoholics.

09:33.720 --> 09:39.400
Now, while I enjoy the occasional beverage, and I talk about it here on this program,

09:39.400 --> 09:44.320
I would say drinking one, maybe two drinks a week does not make me an alcoholic, so alcohol

09:44.320 --> 09:46.840
didn't cause it, and being fat didn't cause it.

09:46.840 --> 09:51.240
I thought that maybe the fact that I ate out a lot and all that stuff might have caused

09:51.240 --> 09:57.240
me to go to the hospital, but that wasn't it either.

09:57.240 --> 10:05.240
My triglycerides were too low for that to be the case, so that was not the case either.

10:05.240 --> 10:08.960
So they don't know what caused it, and now the thing is, is that I don't want to be into

10:08.960 --> 10:14.200
too much of a downer syndrome or whatever, but folks have been asking.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.880
The weird thing is, is that they did like a CAT scan, they did an MRI and all this shit

10:17.880 --> 10:19.320
on me in the hospital.

10:19.320 --> 10:25.680
I have some type of cyst on my pancreas, apparently, and thank God it's not cancer, says the doctor,

10:25.680 --> 10:31.100
because then I would have what Patrick Swayze has, and that's really not good, and I'm not

10:31.100 --> 10:33.400
trying to make light of that situation.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.160
It's never good to be compared to Patrick Swayze.

10:35.160 --> 10:38.520
Well, no, I'm serious, because he only has so long left to live.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.000
It's the same thing Michael Landon of Highway to Heaven died of years ago, is pancreatic

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
cancer.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.160
Thank God it's not cancer, but still, it's kind of scary.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.880
So I don't mean to bring the show down, but that's basically where I was all week, and

10:49.880 --> 10:52.360
since folks have been asking, that's what's up.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.160
I find the toughest part of all of it is, A, the fact that I didn't do anything to cause

10:56.160 --> 10:57.160
it.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.520
It's one of those cases where really they don't know what caused it.

11:00.520 --> 11:04.160
They think it could be an allergy to the medication I took, although if that's the case, I will

11:04.160 --> 11:08.320
be one of the first documented cases of that kind of allergy, like ever, to this antibiotic

11:08.320 --> 11:09.320
I took.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.560
They also say that stress is a cause.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.080
I'm not that stressed out, though.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.080
Things are pretty good in my life right now, all things considered.

11:15.080 --> 11:19.600
Sure, the life 365 thing sucks, but it's not going to cause me to go into the hospital

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
bad.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.600
You know what I mean?

11:21.600 --> 11:22.600
So I don't know.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.600
I don't know.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.280
It's really bad.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.600
My only thing is I'm always afraid it's going to come back, but I've lost a crazy amount

11:31.600 --> 11:32.600
of weight.

11:32.600 --> 11:37.400
In the past month, I've lost 21 pounds, to put it, and you probably notice if you're

11:37.400 --> 11:40.000
on just a TV because my pants won't stay on.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
It's kind of sexy.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
No, I'm just kidding.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
All right.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.560
I'll stop being such a downer now.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.320
That was my week and why I didn't have much of a gaming week.

11:48.320 --> 11:54.640
I noticed that strolling in a little late to the program is Drew is finally here.

11:54.640 --> 11:55.640
Yes, that's on.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.680
It's very sensitive, though, so be careful with it.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.680
He'll pick you up from a long way away.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.680
Just leave it there then.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
Maybe you can.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.440
Just kind of tilt it towards you and talk into it.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.440
Hey, guys.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.440
Are you listening clearly, I hope?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.440
Yeah.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.440
All right.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.440
Introduce yourself.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.440
It's DrewNami, of course.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.440
It's DrewNami.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.440
Of course.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.440
And you were here episode one, weren't you?

12:15.440 --> 12:17.080
I was not here episode one.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.080
I was listening to episode one.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.160
But you were listening to episode one, and now you're here for the last show on Life

12:21.160 --> 12:22.160
is Five.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.160
Well, not the last, last show.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.160
Yeah.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.840
I remember episode one, I was listening from New York.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.840
So how was your gaming week?

12:28.840 --> 12:31.240
We're going to get that mic a little closer to you while you talk about your gaming week.

12:31.240 --> 12:32.240
Yeah.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.240
You move a little closer.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.360
I don't know what happened to Irene, so we'll wait for her later.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.680
Well, how was your gaming week?

12:36.680 --> 12:39.000
Well, I've been on my WoW methadone.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.280
I've been on Guild Wars for a while, got the new expansion for it.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.640
It's pretty good.

12:44.640 --> 12:50.360
I got in with a guild from Game Facts, a small little guild.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.120
It's not WoW, but it's good enough.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.600
What's so exciting about the most recent Guild Wars expansion?

12:57.600 --> 13:02.840
They give you a whole bunch of new NPC heroes to put in your party if you're antisocial

13:02.840 --> 13:03.840
and shit.

13:03.840 --> 13:09.120
And you get a whole bunch of new missions, new skills, basically new everything, and

13:09.120 --> 13:10.960
it all leads into Guild Wars 2.

13:10.960 --> 13:12.520
Yeah, they're still saying you're really quiet.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.600
Go ahead and just pick up the mic.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.520
Just hold it away from your mouth.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.520
Live radio, folks.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
Come on, come on.

13:18.520 --> 13:19.520
It happens.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
All right.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
Did you play on April 1st?

13:21.520 --> 13:24.520
Yeah, did you play on April 1st, and everyone was a stick figure?

13:24.520 --> 13:28.600
Yeah, I played on April 1st, and I think the reason why it wasn't picking me up was because

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
the mic was off.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.640
Oh, how convenient.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.640
That might have been the problem.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.640
That's all right.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.440
All right, but it's on now.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.440
We're good.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.840
So anything else you're giving me?

13:38.840 --> 13:43.680
I've actually been participating in one of the X-Fire events for Grand Chase.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.800
Apparently, there's still an open beta, and they want people to test it out, so they're

13:46.800 --> 13:50.680
doing in-game contests and such.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.240
It's pretty good.

13:52.240 --> 13:59.600
It's kind of like Smash Brothers meets MapleStory, if you can even ponder that as possible.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.240
Are you going to miss Live 365?

14:01.240 --> 14:05.400
Yeah, I am going to miss Live 365, fourth and all.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.720
What are you going to miss most about it?

14:07.720 --> 14:11.520
Pretty much listening to 24-7 Station while playing WoW, but both of those are going to

14:11.520 --> 14:13.800
be gone.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.040
You're ditching WoW, too?

14:15.040 --> 14:17.520
I stopped playing WoW back in October.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.280
Oh, in favor of Guild Wars, or just...

14:20.280 --> 14:22.040
In favor of having money.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.320
Oh, and having a life.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.320
I ran out of money.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.200
Ah, I gotcha.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.600
WoW is an expensive habit.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.440
I'll probably join back up with a new expansion, but...

14:32.440 --> 14:33.800
There are ways to play for free.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.800
There are ways to play for free, but they all suck.

14:37.800 --> 14:38.800
Hacksource servers.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.760
No, I can't imagine they're fun at all.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.160
Not that, but yeah, there are ways to pay for free.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.720
Oh, latest 2600.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.720
What?

14:45.720 --> 14:48.000
You could steal prepaid cards from the store.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
On the 2600.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Oh, you...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
No.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I hate April Fools.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
No, no, no.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.400
You can move in a total of eight directions.

14:54.400 --> 14:58.760
No, I meant in the latest magazine of the 2600.

14:58.760 --> 14:59.760
Oh, 2600 magazine.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.760
Oh, that 2600.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.760
No, not the Atari 2600.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.760
No, no, no, no.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.760
Let's not even talk about 2600.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.760
No.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
No.

15:05.760 --> 15:11.360
It's something that has to do with PayPal and crap, so whatever.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
Interesting.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.400
But you have to do it every time you play it, so that's annoying.

15:15.400 --> 15:16.400
Alright.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.680
I love, though, that you have the Horde symbol on your laptop.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.720
That always makes me giddy.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.640
I dug this up from some of my old stuff.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.000
I never expected you to get a laptop.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.480
I hope they can see that on Justin.TV, our little...

15:27.480 --> 15:28.480
I'll skip.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.480
Alright, awesome.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.480
Alright.

15:30.480 --> 15:34.120
Turn that mic off when we're not using it, because it makes a lot of clicky, clicky noises,

15:34.120 --> 15:35.120
so...

15:35.120 --> 15:36.400
I don't know.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.400
What the hell?

15:37.400 --> 15:38.800
That mic is on crack.

15:38.800 --> 15:43.200
Alright, well, I think that's going to do it for everybody's gaming week, so let's talk

15:43.200 --> 15:46.320
a little bit about housekeeping.

15:46.320 --> 15:50.240
Really the only thing on deck is that there is the All Games move pending.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.500
That's going to start on April the 13th.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.500
Love this, by the way.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.880
AllGames.com is rolling out the red carpet for us.

15:55.880 --> 15:56.880
We love them.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.880
They're being great.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.000
There's actually a little countdown clock on AllGames.com that says, like, it counts

16:02.000 --> 16:06.360
down the days and hours and minutes until OLR comes exclusively to their station.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.640
It's going to be great.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.440
So look for us there.

16:09.440 --> 16:16.400
The plug will be pulled on live 365 on the 12th, probably around 8 or 9 o'clock at night.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.800
I'm hoping that we're here to do it live, or at least I'll be here to sign on live,

16:20.800 --> 16:24.720
say some final, final farewells, and then officially pull the plug for Dead Air.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.880
So the plug will ceremonially be pulled on Saturday night.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
That'll be fun.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
Sorry, I...

16:29.880 --> 16:30.880
What?

16:30.880 --> 16:31.880
No.

16:31.880 --> 16:32.880
It's almost like it's a person.

16:32.880 --> 16:33.880
Yes, it's almost like it's a person.

16:33.880 --> 16:34.880
I know.

16:34.880 --> 16:35.880
Pulling the plug on.

16:35.880 --> 16:40.280
We will be taking the horse out to the barn and shooting it on Saturday.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.680
No, they will become glue.

16:42.680 --> 16:47.400
I know we make fun of it here, and some of the, like, even some folks in chat were commenting

16:47.400 --> 16:51.720
earlier like, boy, they sure sound like they're going to miss the 24-7 feed.

16:51.720 --> 16:52.720
We are.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.080
We're going to miss it.

16:54.080 --> 16:58.280
But at the same time, you know what, it's kind of like one of the songs in the pre-show

16:58.280 --> 17:00.880
tonight, which had a very tongue-in-cheek theme tonight if you were listening our little

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
pre-show music.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.520
A change will do you good.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.160
So this is going to be something new for us.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.480
It's going to be fun.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.240
So that's that.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.800
Zappi says, will there be punch at the plug pulling?

17:13.800 --> 17:14.800
Punch and pat.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.480
Punch and pat.

17:16.480 --> 17:22.480
But not alcoholic punch because I don't want to go back to the hospital with more pancreatitis.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.800
Please nod that.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.840
So we're excited, though, about allgames.com.

17:26.840 --> 17:33.600
I still don't have the final word for you on Travis and DMN and all that, but if I had

17:33.600 --> 17:38.980
a Magic 8-Ball and I shook it, it would say Outlook looks good.

17:38.980 --> 17:42.560
They're probably going to come over a little later than us, but we'll be there on Sunday

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
the 13th.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Excited.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.600
All right, enough housekeeping.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.200
Let's get into gaming news that we can taunt to make fun of.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.200
Loki.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.600
Okay, so this is pretty awesome.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.280
It's been rumored to be happening, but finally official now.

17:58.280 --> 18:04.640
Sam and Max are coming to the Wii, and of course it's being brought to us in the U.S.

18:04.640 --> 18:09.980
by Dreamcatcher and of course the adventure company, and in Europe, Joe Wood of course

18:09.980 --> 18:14.160
is publishing it there.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.200
Not really any word on what exactly it will include.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.640
Probably a lot of the episodes that we saw on the PC.

18:21.640 --> 18:25.680
Don't know if maybe it's a compilation of season one, maybe something like season two.

18:25.680 --> 18:26.680
Who knows?

18:26.680 --> 18:30.240
Maybe it's even like, no, it's not going to have download content on the Wii.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.660
But I don't know, it's pretty awesome, though.

18:33.660 --> 18:42.600
So glad to be able to play some Sam and Max since I don't use GameTap or want to buy software.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.480
And so that's going to be going to WiiWare?

18:44.480 --> 18:46.440
I think that's actually going to be going to the Wii.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.240
Oh, so it's not WiiWare.

18:48.240 --> 18:52.800
Because I remember there was a rumor a while back that it was going to go to WiiWare.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.680
I guess they could do it that way, but I don't think they would.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.960
I think it'd just be the first season or something like that.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.960
Yeah, that would be exciting.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.840
I mean, if they package all the games together into one because the games themselves are

19:04.840 --> 19:10.560
only three to four hours long, but if they package the entire first season, which was

19:10.560 --> 19:12.840
like eight episodes, I want to say, I don't remember off the top of my head.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.160
Maybe they could do the first and second season or something like that.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.800
That would be a great deal because that would be, you know, you'd probably have like at

19:19.800 --> 19:23.080
least 15 episodes all together in one place.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.280
I think that would be a pretty good deal.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.800
And yeah, for those people that don't really game on the PC or have GameTap or any of that,

19:28.800 --> 19:30.200
I think it'll be pretty good.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.360
So we will see what happens.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.880
Are you going to check out Sam and Max if it comes to the Wii Dark Soccer?

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
No.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.880
No?

19:36.880 --> 19:37.880
Why not?

19:37.880 --> 19:38.880
I'm not interested in it.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
Aw, sorry to hear that.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.600
Drew Nami, are you a Sam and Max fan?

19:41.600 --> 19:44.400
Uh, used to be, as of the original.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.840
You remember, you have to talk into a mic, or else people can't hear you.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.680
I thought I turned on and pointed at me.

19:49.680 --> 19:50.680
That's alright.

19:50.680 --> 19:56.120
Uh, I'm probably going to play it, if I don't have to buy it.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.640
Gotcha so if you can borrow it from somebody or something, you'll play it.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
Gotcha.

20:00.640 --> 20:07.880
Uh, Black Wolf, who's a big Sam and Max fan in chat, says the first season is six episodes

20:07.880 --> 20:09.800
and the second season is five episodes.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.320
You know, the reason why I probably thought it was eight is because of the time I went

20:12.320 --> 20:13.800
on the game tab to check it out.

20:13.800 --> 20:17.240
Probably we had the six and then two from the second season, so I probably thought,

20:17.240 --> 20:18.240
oh, there's eight of them.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.240
Okay, six and five.

20:19.240 --> 20:23.800
Still, that's not a bad deal for eleven episodes.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.640
That's still pretty it's because it'll be a thirty, forty hour game, that's the size

20:26.640 --> 20:28.640
of most games.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.000
That'll be a good deal.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.520
Uh, this is also going to be a good deal, would be a Super Smash Bros. Brawl sequel.

20:35.520 --> 20:42.320
It's also kind of a duh, but at the same time, it would be interesting if a Brawl sequel

20:42.320 --> 20:46.480
came to the Wii, because if you think about the previous Nintendo consoles, they only

20:46.480 --> 20:49.440
had one Smash Bros. game apiece.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.160
Nintendo 64 had that Smash Bros. game, which I want to say was originally developed for

20:53.160 --> 20:58.320
the Super Nintendo, but was brought over to the 64 when the, you know, console life switched

20:58.320 --> 20:59.320
up a little bit.

20:59.320 --> 21:03.640
Uh, and then the GameCube had one, now the Wii has its one, so it'd be kind of weird

21:03.640 --> 21:05.160
if there was a second one on the Wii.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.160
I don't think Nintendo plans to move away from the Wii anytime soon, so it would be

21:08.160 --> 21:10.000
kind of interesting if we got a sequel.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.560
What is the basis for this?

21:11.560 --> 21:15.640
Well, Nintendo is, in one of their latest surveys, they do these surveys all the time

21:15.640 --> 21:20.260
on their website, they're asking a question about how likely would you be to buy a sequel

21:20.260 --> 21:24.000
to Super Smash Bros. Brawl on a scale of one to seven?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.400
One being I wouldn't buy it, seven being I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.880
I'm sure most people are saying, seven, seven, seven!

21:30.880 --> 21:33.780
I don't know how many people wouldn't say seven, but it'll be interesting.

21:33.780 --> 21:37.640
What else can they do with, uh, Smash Bros. Brawl?

21:37.640 --> 21:38.640
I mean...

21:38.640 --> 21:39.640
A DS version?

21:39.640 --> 21:42.040
Ah, there you go.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.720
I bet, I bet that's it.

21:43.720 --> 21:47.400
I bet that's exactly what they're gonna do, I bet it'll be a DS version.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.360
You think if there was a DS version it would be just a dumbed down, uh, same version you

21:51.360 --> 21:54.920
kind of have on the Wii now, or do you think they'd, uh, actually take the time to make

21:54.920 --> 21:57.880
something kind of new, maybe with some more DS-centric characters?

21:57.880 --> 22:01.360
Well, keep in mind the DS is basically a handheld Nintendo 64.

22:01.360 --> 22:02.960
I guess that's true.

22:02.960 --> 22:07.800
So it'd probably be more like a throwback to the old Smash Bros.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.800
True.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.720
Of course they're gonna whore this out, you know, but I don't think it's gonna come any

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
time soon.

22:13.720 --> 22:17.920
I think it'll be at least maybe a year or two off if they're gonna do something like

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
that.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.280
Jaded in chat says, the PictoChat level where you can draw your own pics.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.640
That might be kind of fun.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.320
I bet the online, online seems to work a little better on the DS than it does on the Wii.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.240
I bet online would work better.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.440
Yeah, I guess.

22:31.440 --> 22:34.320
The PictoChat level would be full of, like, cocks or something.

22:34.320 --> 22:40.800
I'm just, I'm not too, I'm not too confident with, uh, Nintendo and their online.

22:40.800 --> 22:44.680
Ross Steel UT says, I say we bring back the Virtual Boy with Smash Bros.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.680
No!

22:45.680 --> 22:46.680
Yes.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.680
I do not want a migraine.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.520
Or, unless it's a playable character, that'd be cool.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.880
I would not mind the migraine.

22:50.880 --> 22:54.400
They should do a Super Nintendo version of Smash Bros., that'd be cool.

22:54.400 --> 22:55.400
Why?

22:55.400 --> 22:56.400
It's gone!

22:56.400 --> 22:57.840
The system's, like, dead and gone.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.360
It's as dead as this station.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.160
Bring it on to the, uh, DS.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.600
Do it all 2D.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.320
I would, I would believe that a Smash Bros. would come to DS.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.800
Do a Smash Bros. game in, like, the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 engine or something like that.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.800
Well, we'll see what happens.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.800
Maybe the arcade Smash Bros., eh.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.280
Maybe that'll be the thing, is they'll get third parties on board.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.280
I don't know.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.280
We'll see.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.000
But, uh, regardless, I'm sure that this survey is a no-brainer.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.020
It depends on who they're surveying.

23:24.020 --> 23:27.080
If they surveyed us, I'm sure we'd all be saying, why even waste money on a friggin'

23:27.080 --> 23:28.080
survey like that?

23:28.080 --> 23:32.840
Well, I think it's one sequel, so for a really popular game, I have no idea.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.480
In other news, water is indeed wet.

23:35.480 --> 23:39.920
Oh, and Jamie, just think of the Virtual Boy possibilities, you can have the Teleroboxer

23:39.920 --> 23:40.920
stage.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
No.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.920
No.

23:42.920 --> 23:43.920
No.

23:43.920 --> 23:44.920
No.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.400
The migraines are not worth it.

23:46.400 --> 23:51.780
My Virtual Boy is sealed in foam in a plastic case, never to be opened again.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.120
I wanna play Virtual Boy.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.120
I haven't played one in years, I was, like, 12.

23:56.120 --> 23:57.120
I'll bring it next week.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.120
I'll bring the Blockbuster one.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.120
It'll be fun.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.520
We have one of the ones that Blockbuster was selling, that's why we have the nice hard

24:01.520 --> 24:02.520
case and everything.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.680
Can we hook up Virtual Boy to Justin.tv somehow?

24:04.680 --> 24:06.880
Have the headache cam?

24:06.880 --> 24:09.080
It wouldn't be easy, but you could do it.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.280
That might be fun.

24:10.280 --> 24:14.440
Yes, I say, we should have some type of competition with the Virtual Boy, like, who can play the

24:14.440 --> 24:16.600
longest without having a seizure?

24:16.600 --> 24:17.600
Throwing up.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.360
Or throwing up.

24:19.360 --> 24:23.880
And Cheeseburger in chat asks the definitive question, if Chuck Norris was in Brawl, what

24:23.880 --> 24:25.680
would be his final smash?

24:25.680 --> 24:28.400
An overused joke.

24:28.400 --> 24:33.760
Don't you know that that hand is actually Chuck Norris' hand?

24:33.760 --> 24:36.040
Let's move on to the next story, please, before the Chuck Norris jokes.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.520
God, you guys are chinging to me.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.520
That's okay.

24:39.520 --> 24:44.740
Well, you know, there is actually, for anybody who has been waiting, and I know lots of people

24:44.740 --> 24:51.400
have for Mario Kart Wii, there's gonna be a really awesome launch ready for it at midnight

24:51.400 --> 24:54.920
on the verge of the 26th to the 27th.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.760
And guess where it's gonna be?

24:56.760 --> 24:57.760
My pants.

24:57.760 --> 24:58.760
No.

24:58.760 --> 24:59.760
Sam's Club!

24:59.760 --> 25:04.180
Cause no one knows how to get down like Sam's Club.

25:04.180 --> 25:09.840
You can go to Sam's Club and it'll even have 15 Wii consoles on hand.

25:09.840 --> 25:13.040
Will they have the ladies serving the samples of the little teeny weenies?

25:13.040 --> 25:14.640
Dude, I would go just for that.

25:14.640 --> 25:19.080
What they forget to mention is those 15 Wii consoles are being sold together in like a

25:19.080 --> 25:21.680
giant family pack of Wiis.

25:21.680 --> 25:29.120
No, it's the Wii plus like 50 controllers and shitty games and a box of Fruit Loops.

25:29.120 --> 25:33.120
The Sam's Club actually realized that they're not a club and they're just a store.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.240
And a two gallon container of mayonnaise.

25:36.240 --> 25:41.640
Cause, you know, when you think video games, you think Sam's Club.

25:41.640 --> 25:46.200
I bought the Vio at Sam's Club.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.200
Here's my question.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.480
It's all Sam's Clubs that are doing this or is it just a few?

25:50.480 --> 25:57.680
It's not actually saying a few, it's just saying Sam's Club.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.440
We should party down at Sam's Club.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.440
Here's what I'm thinking.

26:00.440 --> 26:06.200
If it is at every Sam's Club, we go to the Sam's Club out in freaking Roseville, okay?

26:06.200 --> 26:08.400
Cause Roseville knows how to get down, okay?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
There's like a lot of retired people out in Roseville.

26:10.400 --> 26:13.120
Okay, what we'll do, we'll go there and we'll dress to the nine.

26:13.120 --> 26:19.540
Like we'll dress in party hats and boas and you know, we have those hats.

26:19.540 --> 26:23.200
We have those hats, the little Mario hats that Rama gave us some time ago.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.440
We can wear our little hats, it'd be fun.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.440
Count me in.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.080
You know what?

26:29.080 --> 26:30.860
If they're doing it, we gotta do that.

26:30.860 --> 26:31.860
You know what?

26:31.860 --> 26:32.860
What?

26:32.860 --> 26:34.940
I'll just have my copy the day it comes out.

26:34.940 --> 26:36.440
You don't want to go party at Sam's Club?

26:36.440 --> 26:37.960
I'll go come home with Smash Brothers.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.320
Dude, two gallons of mayonnaise, Jamie.

26:40.320 --> 26:41.320
Rob.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.320
What?

26:42.320 --> 26:43.320
Rob.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.320
Rob.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.320
What?

26:45.320 --> 26:47.440
Loki, are you down with the Sam's Club party?

26:47.440 --> 26:50.760
Fuck that, I'll probably already have the game by the time the thing launches.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.400
God, you people are no fun at all.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.400
You don't go for the game.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.440
I sit in line for a wee.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.160
How can I get excited about Sam's Club?

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
That's the point.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.160
That's the point.

26:59.160 --> 27:03.440
We took our lawn chairs and sat in line for a wee.

27:03.440 --> 27:08.040
We'll probably go there and be like, sorry, we're not doing the launch party and be like,

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
crap.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.760
I will go and you know why, because I have nothing better to do.

27:12.760 --> 27:18.240
Will anyone go party at Sam's Club with me?

27:18.240 --> 27:22.920
Well if you don't want to go to Sam's Club to get Mario Kart, maybe you want to go to

27:22.920 --> 27:24.800
Japan to get Trauma Center 2.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.400
That's right, the game is actually being slated for the DS.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.680
It's coming back.

27:29.680 --> 27:37.400
I guess the second opinion wasn't really a sequel then, but Trauma Center 2 and I guess

27:37.400 --> 27:43.680
the sequel has Dr. Stiles and Nurse Angie tackling the effects of the unanswered mysteries

27:43.680 --> 27:47.040
of the guilt virus from the prequel.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.260
See, the guilt virus is the guilt that you have from not buying the wee version.

27:51.260 --> 27:56.480
That kind of surprises me that the latest one they had on the Nintendo Wii was not Trauma

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
Center 2.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.640
I just kind of took it as Trauma Center 2.

27:59.640 --> 28:05.920
Of course, there's going to be new characters and different tools and stuff like that.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.000
But pretty much par for the course stuff.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.400
Trauma Center is one of those games where I swear it's one of those blink and you miss

28:12.400 --> 28:19.880
it kind of games, but to quote an epic story that once aired on the station and on the

28:19.880 --> 28:24.120
nightly news here locally, it's so much fun.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.560
Trauma Center is so much fun.

28:25.560 --> 28:29.640
I like making them die.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.640
I do too.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.300
I love the whole bringing them back to life.

28:34.300 --> 28:43.040
The Wii controls in that game are really cool because when you have to do the whole defibrillator

28:43.040 --> 28:45.320
you have to push into the screen onto the body.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.320
It's really funny.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.000
I like Trauma Center.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.760
I would think you of all people, Loki, Trauma Center would be one of your favorites.

28:51.760 --> 28:57.600
No, I liked it better when it was called Life and Death and came out early PCs back when

28:57.600 --> 28:59.240
they had Windows 3.1.

28:59.240 --> 29:04.120
Life or death was hardcore and everybody and the only surgeries you'd do would be removing

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
appendixes.

29:05.120 --> 29:08.120
Oh my God, life or death was hardcore though.

29:08.120 --> 29:11.080
If you screwed up in that game, you were killing patients left and right.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.080
It was a very hard game.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.500
Hence why it's called Life and Death in that life and maybe...

29:14.500 --> 29:18.320
They should have called it Life but Mostly Death because that's what that game was.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.900
I was like, I'm going to scribble with the scalpel and you have to read all this stuff

29:21.900 --> 29:24.760
before you go and do the surgeries, but we didn't like to read.

29:24.760 --> 29:25.760
We just wanted the scalpel.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.760
That's true.

29:26.760 --> 29:27.760
Trauma Center...

29:27.760 --> 29:28.760
Calcipa makes the best suggestion.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.320
In chat, what do you say?

29:30.320 --> 29:32.360
Psychological Trauma Center.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.600
That would be kind of rad.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
Yeah.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.600
All right.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.600
You know what else is going to be...

29:38.600 --> 29:39.600
What?

29:39.600 --> 29:43.240
I was going to say, oh no, I have to repair your daddy left you or something.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.440
That is so, so wrong.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.440
Scalpel.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.440
Look.

29:47.440 --> 29:49.120
We can start with celebrities.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.120
I know.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
Yeah.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.520
See, celebrities are okay to make fun of.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.280
Remember, Dennis Leary said it best.

29:54.280 --> 29:58.400
The best way for all those celebrities, the best therapy for them is Shut the Fuck Up

29:58.400 --> 30:00.720
by Dr. Dennis Leary.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.840
All right, look.

30:02.840 --> 30:03.840
Let's move on to games.

30:03.840 --> 30:08.220
I do want Trauma Center 2, but I definitely, definitely want this.

30:08.220 --> 30:12.800
I was actually surprised to hear that Final Fantasy IV was not already confirmed for North

30:12.800 --> 30:16.520
America, but then again, this is Squeenix we're talking about.

30:16.520 --> 30:23.160
But apparently this week, Final Fantasy IV director Takashi Tokita did confirm that Final

30:23.160 --> 30:26.080
Fantasy IV is being localized for North America.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.040
That was in the latest issue of Nintendo Power.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.040
Okay, wait.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.040
Scratch that.

30:30.040 --> 30:36.840
He didn't actually confirm the localization, but I mean, there was English language screenshots

30:36.840 --> 30:39.280
in the article.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.480
It's on the cover of the freaking magazine.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.920
I think it's safe to say the game's coming out over here.

30:43.920 --> 30:47.000
I think it's safe to say the game's coming out here.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.860
I wouldn't know or anything.

30:48.860 --> 30:51.160
Would you know about when the game is coming out here by chance?

30:51.160 --> 30:56.200
I would say it's coming out around here somewhere around here.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.200
In time for my birthday?

30:58.200 --> 30:59.200
No.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.200
Damn it.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.920
I can't get you what I was going to get you for your birthday.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.280
Of course, I don't remember when your birthday is, unfortunately.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
June 26th.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
Don't forget it.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.280
No.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.280
It's not going to be out for my birthday?

31:09.280 --> 31:10.280
No.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.280
Will it be out in July?

31:11.280 --> 31:12.280
Maybe.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.760
Can we play hot and cold?

31:13.760 --> 31:15.760
Is it July 15th?

31:15.760 --> 31:16.760
Warm.

31:16.760 --> 31:17.760
July 17th.

31:17.760 --> 31:18.760
Warmer.

31:18.760 --> 31:19.760
July 24th.

31:19.760 --> 31:20.760
No, still warm.

31:20.760 --> 31:21.760
July 18th.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.760
What's a Tuesday?

31:22.760 --> 31:23.760
Hold on.

31:23.760 --> 31:24.760
Pulling up a calendar.

31:24.760 --> 31:29.760
This is how we get Loki to tell us secrets now.

31:29.760 --> 31:30.760
July 22nd.

31:30.760 --> 31:31.760
No.

31:31.760 --> 31:32.760
July 15th.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.760
No.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.760
Are they putting it on a Sunday or something?

31:34.760 --> 31:35.760
July 20th.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
No, further.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.760
Forget it.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.760
It's close to August, okay?

31:38.760 --> 31:39.760
July 29th.

31:39.760 --> 31:40.760
No.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.760
God.

31:41.760 --> 31:42.760
July 27th.

31:42.760 --> 31:43.760
Right now, it's at the end of July, okay?

31:43.760 --> 31:44.760
Let's just see what that is.

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
That's not the only game coming over here.

31:45.760 --> 31:46.760
Oh, whatever.

31:46.760 --> 31:47.760
No.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
No.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
No.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.760
No.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
No.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.760
No.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.760
No.

31:53.760 --> 31:54.760
Should we run it over here?

31:54.760 --> 31:55.760
Oh, what else?

31:55.760 --> 31:57.200
Uh, just another game.

31:57.200 --> 31:58.900
Is it Chrono Trigger?

31:58.900 --> 31:59.900
It's not Chrono Trigger.

31:59.900 --> 32:00.900
Is it Chrono Trigger?

32:00.900 --> 32:04.360
It's another DS game that's already in Japan right now, that I'm showing you the title

32:04.360 --> 32:05.360
for.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.640
Can I please say that on-

32:06.640 --> 32:07.800
Go ahead.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.080
Dragon Quest V.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.080
Yeah.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.480
Wait, what?

32:11.480 --> 32:14.000
Dragon Quest V.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.100
That's apparently getting localized as well.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.400
Excuse me for a second.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.400
Should be fun.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.880
Did you just squee in your pants?

32:20.880 --> 32:21.880
What the hell was that noise?

32:21.880 --> 32:23.080
No, I just squee'd into the mic.

32:23.080 --> 32:31.000
Actually, there's another game coming out too, the same day as Final Fantasy IV, but

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
it's not for the DS.

32:32.000 --> 32:39.040
It's actually a 360 RPG that's by Square Enix, although it's got the weirdest title ever,

32:39.040 --> 32:44.240
Infinite Undiscovery, so that should be coming around at the same time.

32:44.240 --> 32:47.520
But a lot of stuff can move.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.520
But they're coming.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.840
Alright, so Dragon Quest V, Final Fantasy IV in July, you didn't hear it here.

32:52.840 --> 32:53.840
You did not hear it.

32:53.840 --> 32:54.840
It might not be July.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.840
That's true.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.840
Games get pushed back all the time.

32:56.840 --> 32:57.840
Alright.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.120
I have to do Dragon Quest VI, now we're hulking.

33:00.120 --> 33:03.240
Alright, so, but still, where's Chrono Trigger?

33:03.240 --> 33:05.560
I mean, that's the game everybody wants, right?

33:05.560 --> 33:07.160
You can pretty much, okay, let me put it this way.

33:07.160 --> 33:12.940
If it's a Square Enix RPG, and it's being made in Japan, and it's come out in Japan,

33:12.940 --> 33:15.600
you can bet it's going to be localized for here.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.320
Mother 3.

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
That's not a Square Enix game.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.320
That was it.

33:19.320 --> 33:20.320
That was...

33:20.320 --> 33:21.320
Nintendo themselves.

33:21.320 --> 33:22.320
Yeah, that was Nintendo.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.680
That's what I call them now, if we're not bringing that over here.

33:25.680 --> 33:26.680
Bastard Nintendo.

33:26.680 --> 33:27.680
Yes, they did.

33:27.680 --> 33:28.680
It came out over there.

33:28.680 --> 33:29.680
Why not here?

33:29.680 --> 33:30.680
Well, just...

33:30.680 --> 33:31.680
What's up with that, Nintendo?

33:31.680 --> 33:35.040
Because the same people that own Nintendo own Live 365.

33:35.040 --> 33:40.880
I'll take a detour for a minute to say hello to Rice Princess, who showed up 39 minutes

33:40.880 --> 33:41.880
late.

33:41.880 --> 33:42.880
How are you?

33:42.880 --> 33:43.880
I'm good and late.

33:43.880 --> 33:44.880
How about you?

33:44.880 --> 33:45.880
I'm fine.

33:45.880 --> 33:46.880
Awesome.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.880
I got you a present.

33:47.880 --> 33:48.880
Okay, then I forgive you for being late.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.880
Ooh!

33:49.880 --> 33:50.880
Is that it for me?

33:50.880 --> 33:51.880
This is it for you.

33:51.880 --> 33:52.880
Ooh!

33:52.880 --> 33:53.880
That looks so pretty.

33:53.880 --> 33:54.880
It's kind of random.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.880
It is, but they were on sale, and I'm like, oh, they have penguins.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
I will like it.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.720
They're floor mats for the car with penguins on them.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.720
They're so cute here.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.720
Wow.

34:01.720 --> 34:02.720
I accept your gift.

34:02.720 --> 34:03.720
Woo-hoo!

34:03.720 --> 34:04.720
In lieu of being late.

34:04.720 --> 34:06.520
Your offering pleases kitty.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.320
It smells like new car.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.320
All right.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.320
Oh, that's weird.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.120
I'm getting high on the floor mats.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.240
And I have to say one other thing.

34:14.240 --> 34:17.760
I got a Captain Crunch Malt from Carl's Jr.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.120
It is so fucking, I mean, flippin' good.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.120
Yeah?

34:21.120 --> 34:22.120
It is.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.120
It is fucking good.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
It's free radio.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.120
Yeah.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.120
Oh, my God.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.120
It's so yummy.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.120
I know.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.120
What are they going to do?

34:29.120 --> 34:30.120
Cancel us?

34:30.120 --> 34:31.120
Sorry.

34:31.120 --> 34:32.120
You cannot be on our station anymore.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.120
But, yeah, it's pretty good.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.120
So, yeah.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.120
Okay.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.120
Excellent.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.640
I think we should try to set some sort of Guinness Book of World Records for the most

34:38.640 --> 34:41.480
time fuck has occurred in a podcast.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.040
Maybe for our first all-game show.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.040
That'll be a nice...

34:44.040 --> 34:45.040
Great idea.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.040
That'll be great.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.040
We'll bring a little bell and everything.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.280
That'll be, that'll be, no.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.280
We got to do one show.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.160
We have to do one show over there to get them to like us.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
For those that haven't heard us yet.

34:53.160 --> 34:55.160
It doesn't have to be the first show.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.160
Yeah.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.160
Besides those...

34:57.160 --> 34:58.160
Yeah, that might do it with that crowd.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.120
Those Guinness Records, you have to have somebody on hand to, like, record, you know.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.640
It has to be all official and stuff.

35:03.640 --> 35:07.080
No, what we'll do, what we'll do the second show over there will be the fuck show.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.080
We'll do that.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.080
Yay.

35:09.080 --> 35:10.080
We'll lose all of our listeners in one show.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.080
All right.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.080
And we'll have one of those little...

35:12.080 --> 35:19.600
We'll do it South Park style, we'll have one of those little click counters in the corner

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
of the Justin TV feed.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
We'll do it.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
We'll do it.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
Bobby.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
Fuck show.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.880
Y or N. Bobby's in chat right now.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.560
Also say hello to Nathan, who's here.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
Hello.

35:31.560 --> 35:32.660
How are you?

35:32.660 --> 35:33.800
I am fine.

35:33.800 --> 35:37.620
Was the Captain Crunch milkshake flipping fantastic?

35:37.620 --> 35:38.620
It was.

35:38.620 --> 35:39.620
It was?

35:39.620 --> 35:40.620
Glad to hear it.

35:40.620 --> 35:41.620
I can't drink it or it might kill me.

35:41.620 --> 35:47.360
Because I have to stay away from high fat foods for a month.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.720
But if they had Captain Crunch Jell-O, I'd be all over that shit.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.720
I'll make you.

35:52.720 --> 35:53.720
Yay.

35:53.720 --> 35:57.320
Rob, you should have a smoothie.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.560
Black Wolf says why.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.960
So fuck show it is.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.160
So what night is that?

36:03.160 --> 36:06.320
It wouldn't be April 13th, it would be the 20th.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.200
It would be the show the day after my birthday.

36:09.200 --> 36:12.080
Well fuck, I'm in.

36:12.080 --> 36:15.520
I think that's a great idea because I'm going to be gone most of that week.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.960
You're going to come for my birthday stuff, right?

36:16.960 --> 36:17.960
I can't.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.960
I'm going to be out of town.

36:19.960 --> 36:20.960
I'm sorry.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.960
Alright, anyway.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.960
We'll figure something out.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.960
It will be our late April-

36:24.960 --> 36:26.800
Oh my god, the show is on 4-20.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.320
It has to be a fuck show.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.320
Yes.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.320
I know.

36:30.320 --> 36:31.320
Alright.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.320
Enough about the fuck show.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
Jamie, Brownies?

36:33.320 --> 36:35.280
Irene had enough time to go to the bathroom and back and we're still talking about the

36:35.280 --> 36:36.280
fuck show.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.280
Wow.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.280
It's going to be on 4-20.

36:38.280 --> 36:43.360
It's going to be like a really slow, mellow fuck show like, hey man, like, fuck.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.360
No.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.360
Here's the deal.

36:45.360 --> 36:46.360
I think this is the rule.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.360
These are the rules for the fuck show.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.360
Okay.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.360
What?

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
4-20 is marijuana day.

36:51.360 --> 36:52.360
It's not cuss day.

36:52.360 --> 36:54.360
I don't get the correlation here.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.360
It doesn't matter.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.360
Look, we make the rules.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.360
Alright?

36:57.360 --> 36:58.360
Who fucking cares?

36:58.360 --> 36:59.360
Exactly.

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
What do we want?

37:00.360 --> 37:01.360
Here's the thing.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.360
We have to do the show completely normal.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.760
Like, we do the show as always because we don't want to lose all our podcast listeners.

37:05.760 --> 37:11.240
But the contest is who can work the word fuck into their stories the most times and we'll

37:11.240 --> 37:13.200
have, like, a running tally.

37:13.200 --> 37:15.200
Who can work the word into the show?

37:15.200 --> 37:16.200
That's brilliant.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.080
I have created a monster and it's fucking awesome.

37:20.080 --> 37:21.080
A brilliant monster.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.720
We should make that an annual thing.

37:22.720 --> 37:23.720
That would be funny.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.720
Alright.

37:24.720 --> 37:25.720
More details to come.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.400
See, I love live radio.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
I love it.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.320
I cannot imagine not doing this show live.

37:30.320 --> 37:32.980
Can you imagine if we had to leave Live65 and do a tape show?

37:32.980 --> 37:36.120
The magic of doing a live show creates things such as the fuck show.

37:36.120 --> 37:41.320
We'd be like Mariah Carey because she lip syncs her songs all the time.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.600
That's the dumbest joke I've heard in my entire life.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
Shut up!

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
It's recent because she recently...

37:45.600 --> 37:46.600
Forget it, Daniel.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.600
It's recently lame.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
You're recently.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
You're always lame.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.480
Jamie News.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.120
In other news, I has a ferret and you bitches don't.

37:54.120 --> 37:57.340
I mean, wait.

37:57.340 --> 38:04.320
More stuff for the Wii but not the DS is Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo's Dungeon will be coming

38:04.320 --> 38:11.360
out in the summer over here and it's happy and makes me go squee and it'll be $39.99.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.280
It's about time.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.960
It's essentially the game that was on the DS like already.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.840
So we're getting a DS port on the Wii now.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.560
Well, I think it may be remade a little bit.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.880
I mean, Wii is like the porting system.

38:22.880 --> 38:25.520
First it was all our PS2 games get ported with Waggle.

38:25.520 --> 38:26.520
Now we're getting DS games.

38:26.520 --> 38:27.520
Well, I guess that's nothing new.

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
We had Cookin' Mama.

38:28.520 --> 38:30.520
It's, it's cute and it goes quee.

38:30.520 --> 38:34.840
Are you going to buy the game just because the Chocobo goes quee?

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
Yeah.

38:35.840 --> 38:36.840
I am.

38:36.840 --> 38:41.040
Loki, will you hack the game so the Chocobo goes fuck?

38:41.040 --> 38:45.120
No, I don't know how to do that.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.120
Not yet.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
Not yet.

38:47.120 --> 38:54.320
Anyways, so it has been recently discovered that Konami has trademarked a new name for

38:54.320 --> 38:56.160
a Castlevania game.

38:56.160 --> 39:00.960
The title of the game, which is assumed to be for the DS, is Castlevania.

39:00.960 --> 39:05.440
Order of, and I can't even pronounce the rest, it looks like Ekklesia.

39:05.440 --> 39:09.060
Ekklesia, yeah, that's right.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.060
Order of Ekklesia.

39:10.060 --> 39:12.200
Is that a musical term?

39:12.200 --> 39:14.720
I thought all the Castlevania games had to have music in them.

39:14.720 --> 39:15.720
Portrait of Ruin did not.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.720
Oh yeah, Portrait of Ruin.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.120
It has to be something artsy and this one's more like logic.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.120
Ekklesia.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.120
Ekklesia.

39:22.120 --> 39:23.120
I don't know.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.120
Stop making up words.

39:25.120 --> 39:31.960
I suspect that this game will have someone in the Belmont family fighting a vampire,

39:31.960 --> 39:37.680
probably Dracula, and there will be whips of some sort and possibly magic and hearts

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
and stuff.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.440
Okay, hold on.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.000
I'm using my mind reading techniques right now.

39:43.000 --> 39:50.120
Something tells me this game will have holy water as a weapon.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.120
And crosses.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
Yes, and crosses.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
Maybe daggers.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
And an axe.

39:54.120 --> 39:59.200
And one of the characters will have a whip.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.200
You heard it here first, I'm telling you.

40:02.200 --> 40:09.240
When are they going to have a Castlevania game where you fight the Belmonts?

40:09.240 --> 40:12.000
They have had one, Symphony of the Night.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
You fight the Belmonts?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
You fight Richter?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
That's right.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Wasn't that at the second castle?

40:16.000 --> 40:18.600
Sort of, but he's not like the main boss.

40:18.600 --> 40:21.760
He is unless you go do the thing where you have to go fight Shaft.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.960
He is the main boss, totally, if you're not wearing the sunglasses.

40:25.960 --> 40:26.960
Exactly.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.360
That's the only time he actually is.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.320
And there's Aria of Sorrow.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.320
I hadn't played that one.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.000
He is a boss, though.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.560
Richter is awesome.

40:34.560 --> 40:38.200
I like his Ryu look and Rondo of Blood.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.560
I mean like you fight the Belmont family.

40:41.560 --> 40:42.560
Like they're the bad guys.

40:42.560 --> 40:43.560
All of them.

40:43.560 --> 40:48.000
Like, I don't know, because you always fight Dracula or something like that.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
It's like, come on.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Poor Shaft.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Castlevania.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.440
He fucks up the Belmont family reunion.

40:53.440 --> 40:54.440
DS.

40:54.440 --> 40:55.440
Aw, yeah.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.640
Dracula's gonna fuck you up.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.880
I would get me to buy a Castlevania game again.

41:01.880 --> 41:05.080
I haven't really been into the Castlevania series on the DS.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.080
I don't know why.

41:06.080 --> 41:07.520
I love the Castlevania series.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.440
I don't like the 3D Castlevanias.

41:09.440 --> 41:11.160
I mean, they're okay.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.160
Like what?

41:12.160 --> 41:13.160
64?

41:13.160 --> 41:14.160
No.

41:14.160 --> 41:15.160
Like Lament of Innocence.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

41:16.160 --> 41:17.160
Curse of Darkness.

41:17.160 --> 41:18.160
They're okay.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.480
I like my 2D Castlevania.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.560
Yeah, I understand that.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.560
Yeah.

41:22.560 --> 41:27.160
Well, despite whatever it is they're putting out on the DS, it's working, because Nintendo

41:27.160 --> 41:33.560
is supreme when it comes to Japanese hardware and software sales, and this is per the latest

41:33.560 --> 41:35.040
issue of Famitsu Magazine.

41:35.040 --> 41:39.880
The Nintendo DS and the Wii have sold 6.3 and 3.7 million units.

41:39.880 --> 41:42.640
That's 6.3 million for the DS, 3.7 for the Wii.

41:42.640 --> 41:47.980
And Wii Fit is selling like crazy in Japan, 1.76 million units.

41:47.980 --> 41:54.360
Nintendo has the top five spots in software, so this is still selling like crazy in Japan.

41:54.360 --> 42:00.280
I'm not sure how this is news, because that's kind of obvious to me, but it's been circulating

42:00.280 --> 42:02.840
in the blogs this week, so we thought we'd let you know.

42:02.840 --> 42:07.080
But if you want to know what the top five games are right now out of the house of Nintendo,

42:07.080 --> 42:13.140
Wii Fit, Mario Party DS, I actually kind of surprised me that's so high, Wii Sports, because

42:13.140 --> 42:17.600
I believe in Japan they sold it separately, don't forget, Super Smash Brothers Brawl,

42:17.600 --> 42:19.440
and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.220
Those are the top five games.

42:22.220 --> 42:24.960
Don't hate on Pokemon, don't hate.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.880
I don't hate as much as I want.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.320
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon doesn't really count because it's two games, so.

42:30.320 --> 42:31.320
That rhymes.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.840
Oh, that's true, that's a little bit of cheating, isn't it?

42:33.840 --> 42:34.840
Yeah.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.840
All right, cheaters.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.840
Pokey cheaters, cheater-mons.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.840
Cheater-mons.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.840
Cheater, cheater.

42:38.840 --> 42:44.120
All right, so yeah, Nintendo's making a lot of money in Japan.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.120
Go Fig.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.120
Wow, that's news.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.960
What else is new?

42:47.960 --> 42:50.200
I don't know, you tell me what else is new.

42:50.200 --> 42:54.840
This has to do with old stuff for something new.

42:54.840 --> 43:00.200
There has been a fact sheet released for details on Mario Kart Wii, and for anyone who's wanting

43:00.200 --> 43:05.960
to play with their classic controller or the GameCube controller, it has been said that

43:05.960 --> 43:11.360
certain moves will not be able to be used with those controllers.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.360
Like snaking?

43:12.360 --> 43:13.360
I say hooray.

43:13.360 --> 43:14.360
Oh, wait, they do-

43:14.360 --> 43:15.360
It doesn't say specifically.

43:15.360 --> 43:19.320
Ah, they took snaking out of the game altogether, I think we talked about that last week, but

43:19.320 --> 43:20.320
that's good.

43:20.320 --> 43:26.080
But it's basically saying that by using the Wiimote and Nunchuk together, you're supposed

43:26.080 --> 43:31.000
to have full playability in the game, but those people are going to have an advantage

43:31.000 --> 43:33.380
over the people using the older controller schemes.

43:33.380 --> 43:37.640
I have a feeling that it's not so bad as people are making it out to be.

43:37.640 --> 43:42.000
I think it'll probably be because I think you can do different little tricks and stuff,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.920
not just one trick when you're doing jumps to get boosts and stuff.

43:46.920 --> 43:51.840
So you probably will be able to do one trick on the GameCube or classic controller or something

43:51.840 --> 43:57.300
like that, and then the people that have the Wii can use the controller to do different

43:57.300 --> 43:58.960
tricks using the motion controls.

43:58.960 --> 44:04.340
Because with that controller turned sideways or something, there's definitely not that

44:04.340 --> 44:08.720
many buttons to use, and so a lot of it's motion controls, so I don't see why they couldn't

44:08.720 --> 44:13.160
translate that stuff into button presses.

44:13.160 --> 44:14.160
It's just sheer laziness.

44:14.160 --> 44:17.800
Do you think the game's going to control as well with the classic controller anyway?

44:17.800 --> 44:21.440
Because it seems to me like this game is going to be calibrated for that motion control that

44:21.440 --> 44:23.440
an analog stick can't quite replicate.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.440
You know what I mean?

44:24.440 --> 44:26.600
I still think it'll be fine with the classic controller.

44:26.600 --> 44:29.720
I've played Brawl with the classic controller, and I plan on playing this game.

44:29.720 --> 44:30.720
But it's different.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.720
Brawl doesn't rely on motion so much, you know what I mean?

44:32.720 --> 44:36.880
I plan on playing this game with the classic controller, and if that doesn't work, there's

44:36.880 --> 44:41.680
always the remote nunchuck, which you can just use the analog stick on that, and then

44:41.680 --> 44:45.840
some of the motion controls with the remote, because that's not gimped on it.

44:45.840 --> 44:49.400
But I don't think it's going to be a big deal, and the fact that they would do that to try

44:49.400 --> 44:54.840
to force people to buy their stupid, you know, possibly use their stupid steering wheel controller

44:54.840 --> 44:58.520
or something like that, I think it's kind of lame.

44:58.520 --> 45:02.520
Besides, that steering wheel's going to give them problems.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.520
We'll see.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.240
I'm looking forward to the game nevertheless.

45:06.240 --> 45:09.160
It's going to control a lot differently, that's for sure.

45:09.160 --> 45:12.600
But as long as it's better than Double Dash.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.600
Yeah.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.760
Well, this is kind of neat.

45:15.760 --> 45:20.520
It's a homemade game for the Nintendo system.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.700
It's a game called Glider.

45:22.700 --> 45:25.000
It's made by a company called Retro Zone.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.200
I guess it's a remake, I think, of a game that came out on the Mac or something like

45:28.200 --> 45:29.200
that.

45:29.200 --> 45:35.960
But the interesting thing about it is the game will have download content, but it's

45:35.960 --> 45:37.440
not as easy as it sounds.

45:37.440 --> 45:43.480
It's not just like something you can pop into, I don't know, the internet and download it.

45:43.480 --> 45:48.800
You actually have to reflash the cart, and it requires a $70 accessory to do it.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.280
Wow, what a bargain.

45:50.280 --> 45:54.720
But you can get new levels and stuff, and that same accessory will let you dump ROMs

45:54.720 --> 45:56.520
and crap like that.

45:56.520 --> 46:01.560
But it's just still kind of neat to see them actually, first off, making new games, and

46:01.560 --> 46:06.680
secondly, allowing you to add new levels to it.

46:06.680 --> 46:11.360
Aren't there still new games for the Nintendo being made in countries like Taiwan and stuff?

46:11.360 --> 46:16.400
Because didn't we see a version of one of the Tekken games, like I get an NES port or

46:16.400 --> 46:17.400
something recently?

46:17.400 --> 46:18.400
I've seen some weird stuff.

46:18.400 --> 46:23.200
Oh, and those RPGs I've been seeing, like Final Fantasy VII ported to the NES and that

46:23.200 --> 46:24.200
stuff.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.200
Yeah.

46:25.200 --> 46:29.120
And then there's also one that I saw, which is Contra III, ported to the NES.

46:29.120 --> 46:32.400
The Titanic game, that looked like tons of fun.

46:32.400 --> 46:35.480
Yeah, so, I don't know.

46:35.480 --> 46:36.480
It's interesting.

46:36.480 --> 46:40.360
Hell, they're still making like, Vectrix games and stuff like that.

46:40.360 --> 46:43.080
There's always a fan of something somewhere.

46:43.080 --> 46:47.400
Would you play a game based off Titanic on the NES?

46:47.400 --> 46:49.160
No.

46:49.160 --> 46:51.040
Even though Leonardo DiCaprio dies?

46:51.040 --> 46:52.040
No.

46:52.040 --> 46:56.780
Well, if you are interested in playing this game, Glider, you can find it on the website

46:56.780 --> 46:59.280
RetroUSB.com.

46:59.280 --> 47:05.200
It's I believe like $50, no $42 currently it's on backorder, but it'll be coming out

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
early April.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.360
The only bad thing about it is it's black and white, because I really do think it came

47:09.360 --> 47:15.880
out originally on a Mac, the game, I guess it's from 1989.

47:15.880 --> 47:19.720
But what's cool though is it comes with a cardboard box, a printed manual just like

47:19.720 --> 47:25.560
the old NES games, and of course there's the black dust sleeve and that kind of thing.

47:25.560 --> 47:26.560
And it's region free.

47:26.560 --> 47:27.560
This is great.

47:27.560 --> 47:32.320
Someone in Justin TV reminded me of this, Akuma JP in Justin TV Chats mentioned the

47:32.320 --> 47:40.320
V. Not the we, but the V, speaking of innovative software to come out of other countries.

47:40.320 --> 47:42.040
We need to get a V here in studio.

47:42.040 --> 47:43.040
Are we able to do that?

47:43.040 --> 47:44.040
They're expensive.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.960
I don't really want one.

47:45.960 --> 47:48.600
The company also makes some interesting things.

47:48.600 --> 47:57.160
They have a game called Airball, another game called Sudoku 2007, and they make reproductions

47:57.160 --> 48:00.720
of the Nintendo World Championship 1990 cards.

48:00.720 --> 48:01.720
Nice.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.120
That's pretty cool.

48:03.120 --> 48:04.120
Sudoku, yay.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.120
What?

48:05.120 --> 48:07.120
I said Sudoku, yay.

48:07.120 --> 48:08.120
Sudoku?

48:08.120 --> 48:09.120
Yes.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.120
Okay.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.120
Shut up.

48:11.120 --> 48:16.760
Let's see if there's some non-Sudoku games coming out on some very...

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
Shut up again.

48:17.760 --> 48:22.280
I played a lot of Sudoku while I was in the hospital because I was really bored.

48:22.280 --> 48:23.280
And?

48:23.280 --> 48:24.280
And I don't want to ever play anymore.

48:24.280 --> 48:25.280
Ew.

48:25.280 --> 48:26.280
Shut up.

48:26.280 --> 48:27.280
All right.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.280
I just got split from our chat room.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.280
Oh, everybody came back.

48:29.280 --> 48:30.280
I guess the split got fixed.

48:30.280 --> 48:31.560
Live radio.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.400
It has its ups and downs.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.400
Let's see.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.840
Let's look at the release calendars for games coming out soon.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.840
We'll start off in Japan.

48:38.840 --> 48:44.360
Coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan on April the 10th, Turok is coming out.

48:44.360 --> 48:45.360
Yay.

48:45.360 --> 48:46.360
It's not...

48:46.360 --> 48:49.240
Oh, yeah, did you pre-order your copy, right?

48:49.240 --> 48:50.240
I did, yes.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.240
And then I named my kid after Turok.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.240
It was great.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.240
Poor kid.

48:54.240 --> 48:57.120
I wonder if he gets teased.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.480
What grade would he be in now?

48:58.480 --> 49:00.840
Like still in elementary school or...

49:00.840 --> 49:01.840
What?

49:01.840 --> 49:02.840
The kid that was named Turok.

49:02.840 --> 49:03.840
I don't know.

49:03.840 --> 49:04.840
You remember that contest?

49:04.840 --> 49:08.080
They got paid a million dollars to name their kid Turok?

49:08.080 --> 49:09.080
No, I don't remember that.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.200
You host a video game show and you do not know this?

49:11.200 --> 49:13.040
I don't remember old news.

49:13.040 --> 49:14.600
It ain't that old.

49:14.600 --> 49:18.080
This is like, I don't know, 10 years old or something.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.080
All right.

49:19.080 --> 49:22.960
By the way, we apologize that our audio is so fucked up in the studio tonight, but something

49:22.960 --> 49:28.040
about that microphone that they're using in the back is really sensitive, so if you put

49:28.040 --> 49:29.040
it like it...

49:29.040 --> 49:30.040
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.040
I'll talk like right here.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.040
There you go.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.040
That's a perfect level.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.040
Wonderful.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.040
Live radio.

49:35.040 --> 49:37.040
Back to Japan.

49:37.040 --> 49:42.280
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mario Kart Wii makes its way out on April the 10th, as

49:42.280 --> 49:45.600
well as Karous Wii.

49:45.600 --> 49:46.760
That's not Kid Akaris.

49:46.760 --> 49:48.640
That's K-A-R-O-U-S.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.080
And then Neo Geo Stick 2 comes out as well.

49:52.080 --> 49:53.080
I'm not sure if that's a joystick.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.880
Oh, it's just a joystick.

49:55.880 --> 49:57.880
I thought it was actually a game for a minute.

49:57.880 --> 50:00.160
A stick figure game where you're trying to think of a stick fighter.

50:00.160 --> 50:01.160
I don't know.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.160
Stick Fighter, exactly.

50:02.160 --> 50:07.320
On the PlayStation 2, Battle of Sunrise comes out from Sunrise Interactive, so I wonder

50:07.320 --> 50:09.360
if it's like the employees fight each other.

50:09.360 --> 50:10.360
That would be cool.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.240
That would be actually kind of a rad game.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
No.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
This looks like...

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
What kind of game does this look like?

50:15.240 --> 50:20.000
It looks like kind of like one of those robot fighting games that you see quite a bit of

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
in Japan.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.440
It looks like it's got a tech element to it as well.

50:23.440 --> 50:29.240
That must be the gist of it, probably some type of tech game.

50:29.240 --> 50:39.560
Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS, Oshiri Kajiri Mushi no Rhythm Lesson DS comes

50:39.560 --> 50:40.560
out from Sega.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.040
Wait, did you say the first word was...

50:43.040 --> 50:45.040
Oshiri Kajiri Mushi.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.040
That means butt.

50:47.040 --> 50:51.840
I'm probably just mispronouncing it because I horribly do that, but it's a music game.

50:51.840 --> 50:55.900
Learn how to dance like these scary looking critters with flowers coming out of their

50:55.900 --> 50:59.800
heads on the cover of the game.

50:59.800 --> 51:03.720
Maybe they're saying move your butt, rhythm dancing, whatever it's called.

51:03.720 --> 51:04.720
Maybe.

51:04.720 --> 51:07.960
If you live in Japan and you've got no rhythm, hope is on the way.

51:07.960 --> 51:19.360
On the PSP, the only game coming out on the 10th, Nanpure and Okake Puzzle 10,000 Mon.

51:19.360 --> 51:21.920
I think it's just a Sudoku game.

51:21.920 --> 51:22.920
I think that's what they call it.

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
Yay, Sudoku.

51:23.920 --> 51:24.920
Oh, shut up.

51:24.920 --> 51:25.920
You shut up.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.560
How many Sudoku games do they have in the simple series?

51:28.560 --> 51:31.320
It's just nuts.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.400
It's silly because you can just play it for free online.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.600
I don't know why you'd buy a game.

51:35.600 --> 51:40.240
I'm going to remember that, though, that oshiri means butt.

51:40.240 --> 51:44.040
Hey, Justin TV, want me to show my oshiri?

51:44.040 --> 51:47.120
No, please don't proposition that.

51:47.120 --> 51:49.360
I would have to see those.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.680
Oh, my God, Glenn.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
When did he get here?

51:53.680 --> 51:55.880
Nobody knows who Glenn is, never mind.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.880
Nobody knows that joke outside of wow.

51:57.880 --> 51:58.880
I know.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.560
I kind of regret saying that.

52:00.560 --> 52:10.080
According to Alpha Canonogram, it's a butt-biting-bug game.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.080
Sounds like fun.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.200
All right.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.840
And no, I'm not going to show my butt on the Justin TV cam because somebody would, some

52:18.840 --> 52:23.080
sick asshole would highlight it, so I'm not going to do that.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.720
Let's move on.

52:24.720 --> 52:28.120
Let's move on with other release dates, please.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.120
Okay.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.920
How about some for the UK?

52:30.920 --> 52:31.920
How about it?

52:31.920 --> 52:33.640
A bunch of stuff on the 11th.

52:33.640 --> 52:39.160
We have Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, Soldier of Fortune Payback,

52:39.160 --> 52:44.560
The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific on a bunch of systems, Assassin's Creed, Altair's

52:44.560 --> 52:51.840
Chronicles, Assassin's Creed, Director's Cut Edition, Draglade, Mario Kart Wii, Sam & Max

52:51.840 --> 52:54.520
Episode 205, What's New, Beelzebub.

52:54.520 --> 52:58.240
I think that's a funny name, although I still won't play the game.

52:58.240 --> 53:07.680
UEFA Euro 2008, Victorious Boxers Challenge, so you can punch people in the face.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.000
Sounds like fun.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.120
That does sound like fun.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.000
I want to punch people in the face.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.840
Well, Drew's right there.

53:13.840 --> 53:14.840
Hi.

53:14.840 --> 53:16.840
Come here so I can punch you.

53:16.840 --> 53:20.200
Is that it?

53:20.200 --> 53:21.200
Yes.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.200
Okay.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.840
In the US, we're getting a bunch of crap this week.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.920
Yay, crap.

53:27.920 --> 53:28.920
My favorite.

53:28.920 --> 53:32.720
Anyways, let's start things off right.

53:32.720 --> 53:36.360
Dirty Dancing the Game is coming to PC.

53:36.360 --> 53:38.720
Hooray.

53:38.720 --> 53:43.040
There's a game for the DS called Fab Five Soccer, and no, it doesn't have anything to

53:43.040 --> 53:46.000
do with Queer Eye, although that'd be weird.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.240
There's a game called Plushies for the DS.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.880
That's also another weird title.

53:49.880 --> 53:50.880
Wow.

53:50.880 --> 53:51.880
Awesome.

53:51.880 --> 53:53.920
What the hell is wrong with us?

53:53.920 --> 53:54.920
Make some games that aren't stupid.

53:54.920 --> 53:56.800
Dude, they should make a game called Furries.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.480
No, they shouldn't.

53:58.480 --> 54:00.680
You know you would at least rent it, just to see what it's about.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.280
No, I would not waste my money.

54:02.280 --> 54:03.960
It's called Second Life.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.880
It totally is.

54:05.880 --> 54:09.640
The orange box is going to be broken up this week, so we have Half-Life 2, the episode

54:09.640 --> 54:14.280
pack, which I believe is episode one and two.

54:14.280 --> 54:20.800
Then we've also got Portal coming out on PC, and then finally, of course, Team Fortress

54:20.800 --> 54:22.800
2.

54:22.800 --> 54:27.760
On the Wii, Minicopter Adventure Flight, it's a game where you get to play around with a

54:27.760 --> 54:30.520
RC helicopter.

54:30.520 --> 54:34.020
There's also Summer Sports Paradise Island.

54:34.020 --> 54:39.080
It's a Wii game with lawn darts, which are illegal, I guess, in the United States, but

54:39.080 --> 54:40.080
now you can throw lawn darts.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.480
Lawn darts are illegal here?

54:41.480 --> 54:42.480
Yeah.

54:42.480 --> 54:43.480
Dude, we had those growing up.

54:43.480 --> 54:44.480
Yeah, they're illegal now.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.480
Ooh, I'm reporting you to cop dog.

54:46.480 --> 54:47.480
Don't fight it.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.480
You don't know cop dog.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.480
You don't know cop dog.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.480
Report this.

54:50.480 --> 54:51.480
Got hurt.

54:51.480 --> 54:52.480
Let's see here.

54:52.480 --> 54:57.200
Also on the Wii and PlayStation 2, Baroque is coming out this week.

54:57.200 --> 55:02.720
On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart, which is an all-girl anime fighting game from Atlus.

55:02.720 --> 55:03.720
Hot.

55:03.720 --> 55:12.040
And also, Fetal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2, coming out on PlayStation 2 for $14.99.

55:12.040 --> 55:20.920
On PC, we have Overclocked, a history of violence, Assassin's Creed.

55:20.920 --> 55:29.160
And finally, oh, let's see here, Sam and Max Episode 205, What's New Beelzebub, will be

55:29.160 --> 55:34.800
coming out on GameTap and PC, and I guess Civil War Mysteries as well.

55:34.800 --> 55:35.800
Hey!

55:35.800 --> 55:36.800
Sorry.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.600
We make fun on this show.

55:39.600 --> 55:43.520
And I think that's it, and there's, as we mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, Ikaruga

55:43.520 --> 55:46.640
is rumored to be coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade.

55:46.640 --> 55:47.640
Hopefully that's not broken.

55:47.640 --> 55:52.080
And hopefully it isn't a shitty port, because that'll make me cry.

55:52.080 --> 55:55.560
Where is my radiant silver gun?

55:55.560 --> 55:57.280
Questions or comments from chat room.

55:57.280 --> 56:01.360
Qualtippo says, the furry game would be rated D for drama, because I guess there's a lot

56:01.360 --> 56:02.720
of drama in the furry scene.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
I would know.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.720
Really?

56:04.720 --> 56:05.720
You're kidding.

56:05.720 --> 56:12.200
Let's see, Katamari's Forever in chat says, I heard about that, speaking of Arcana Heart.

56:12.200 --> 56:14.580
Eleven girl fighters, girl on girl action.

56:14.580 --> 56:17.160
They have a dog girl in there.

56:17.160 --> 56:20.200
I swear to God, it's a chick that's dog.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.320
Is that like a manbear pig?

56:22.320 --> 56:23.320
This has been done before.

56:23.320 --> 56:28.360
It was called the Asuka 120% series.

56:28.360 --> 56:29.880
So it's not manbear pig.

56:29.880 --> 56:31.920
So this is nothing original, people.

56:31.920 --> 56:32.920
I didn't know this.

56:32.920 --> 56:35.440
Rama says cosplayers hate furries.

56:35.440 --> 56:43.000
I didn't know there was this war between cosplayers and furries.

56:43.000 --> 56:45.080
Dude, that should be a fighting game.

56:45.080 --> 56:48.320
I guess one kind of drama hates the other kind of drama.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.480
Cosplayers versus furries.

56:49.480 --> 56:50.480
I would buy that.

56:50.480 --> 56:52.480
I'm like, I'm just versus ninja.

56:52.480 --> 56:53.480
Exactly.

56:53.480 --> 56:54.480
Oh yeah?

56:54.480 --> 56:55.480
Cowboys.

56:55.480 --> 57:00.200
And SSG100 Matt says, no, no, no.

57:00.200 --> 57:01.640
Everyone hates furries.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.960
Aw, poor furries.

57:03.960 --> 57:05.120
Not poor furries.

57:05.120 --> 57:08.760
They're completely cognizant of what they're doing.

57:08.760 --> 57:09.760
Dude I would love.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.600
Okay, so what are the ideas for games we've had?

57:12.600 --> 57:14.320
We've had laser cats.

57:14.320 --> 57:16.640
We've had, what else do we have on a previous show?

57:16.640 --> 57:18.280
We need to write these things down.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.280
You do.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.280
Put them on the wiki or something.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.280
Something?

57:21.280 --> 57:22.280
Damn it.

57:22.280 --> 57:23.280
Someone had chatters?

57:23.280 --> 57:25.120
Wasn't there something they had to do with paper?

57:25.120 --> 57:29.320
Yeah, it was one of those games, because there was a game for DS coming out that you could

57:29.320 --> 57:30.320
just play on paper.

57:30.320 --> 57:33.040
Like it was like Pictionary or something on the DS.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.640
I remember talking about that in the previous show.

57:34.640 --> 57:38.200
It was something you could play with a pen and paper.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.080
And now I want to add this to the list.

57:40.080 --> 57:41.880
Cosplayers versus furries.

57:41.880 --> 57:43.720
An epic fighting battle.

57:43.720 --> 57:44.720
Bob's voice.

57:44.720 --> 57:45.720
The game.

57:45.720 --> 57:46.720
No, no.

57:46.720 --> 57:47.720
Scratch that from the list.

57:47.720 --> 57:48.720
That wouldn't sell.

57:48.720 --> 57:49.720
L.O.L.

57:49.720 --> 57:54.400
That was the name of the game.

57:54.400 --> 57:57.160
There was a game on the DS called L.O.L. and it was something you could just play with

57:57.160 --> 57:59.080
a fucking piece of paper and a pen.

57:59.080 --> 58:02.960
The whole premise of that game was to get people to laugh or something like that and

58:02.960 --> 58:05.920
they would vote on which drawing is the funniest or something like that.

58:05.920 --> 58:06.920
That's it.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.900
Yes, it's called pen and paper.

58:08.900 --> 58:10.680
Can somebody please add that to the wiki?

58:10.680 --> 58:15.680
Can our wiki gods like AJ Mix or Dark Tetsuya or somebody, can our wiki gods add like a

58:15.680 --> 58:17.920
page of our great ideas?

58:17.920 --> 58:21.280
And be sure to put on the bottom patent pending.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.560
Awesome.

58:22.560 --> 58:24.280
GameStop.com is down.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.800
Hopefully that means that they've closed down.

58:25.800 --> 58:26.800
They're like, we give up.

58:26.800 --> 58:28.520
We have too much money.

58:28.520 --> 58:33.880
Will they close down all the freaking pre-orders for cosplayers versus furries, shut them down?

58:33.880 --> 58:36.480
It's like, oh my god, I can't handle this.

58:36.480 --> 58:37.480
Anyways.

58:37.480 --> 58:41.000
In fact, I would actually like to see some of our listeners go into a GameStop to pre-order

58:41.000 --> 58:47.520
cosplayers versus furries because you know they'll take your $5 for anything and I'd

58:47.520 --> 58:48.840
like to see what happens.

58:48.840 --> 58:53.440
If it's not in the system, they can't do it because it prints up a receipt.

58:53.440 --> 58:55.480
Damn it.

58:55.480 --> 59:01.720
This is the extent of my knowledge from Dan managing a GameStop.

59:01.720 --> 59:03.280
We should probably move on.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.280
Can we?

59:04.280 --> 59:05.280
Yes, please.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.280
Yes.

59:06.280 --> 59:09.000
So if that's it for the US releases.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.520
I think it is at least.

59:10.520 --> 59:13.680
How did release dates turn into cosplayers versus furries?

59:13.680 --> 59:14.680
You did it.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.320
That was your fault, Rob.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.600
You know it.

59:17.600 --> 59:19.040
It was an April Fool's joke.

59:19.040 --> 59:23.360
You know it's actually not the first anymore.

59:23.360 --> 59:27.020
Well I'm trying to transition into talking about some of the April Fool's Day pranks

59:27.020 --> 59:29.760
from around the web and you know I gotta start with this.

59:29.760 --> 59:32.960
This week we had so many April Fool's Day pranks because everyone gets in on it except

59:32.960 --> 59:34.080
for Orange Launch Radio this year.

59:34.080 --> 59:37.080
We didn't do an April Fool's Day prank because we had depressing news.

59:37.080 --> 59:39.880
So the holiday was kind of ruined for us.

59:39.880 --> 59:44.280
However, the IGN trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.640
What the fuck?

59:45.640 --> 59:48.320
Somebody spent like thousands of dollars on it.

59:48.320 --> 59:49.320
Did you see that trailer?

59:49.320 --> 59:50.320
I did see that trailer.

59:50.320 --> 59:53.480
Didn't it make you like want to like come?

59:53.480 --> 59:54.480
Not at all.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.000
It was actually pretty well done.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
It was okay.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:00.440
Some of it was hokey, but it looked like a sci-fi movie to me.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:04.200
What do you expect from a sci-fi channel?

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:07.920
If they put a decent budget behind it and maybe had a good writer or something.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:12.000
I didn't believe for a minute it was real because it didn't have a single star in it

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.440
and a movie like Zelda would at least have a star in it somewhere like Ian McKellen playing

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.480
the old man that says it's tough out there to go alone here take this or something but

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.640
he'd say it in his voice.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.960
It's dangerous to go alone.

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960
Thank you.

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960
That's what it is.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960
It's dangerous.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
Sean Connery.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960
It's dangerous to go alone.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960
It's dangerous.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960
No you can't so you should stop.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.880
But there would be at least one famous person so that's why this thing couldn't be real

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.880
and the CGI was a little hokey but I thought it was pretty amazing the work that they did

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.880
do.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.160
For an April Fool's joke it was awesome.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.080
Yeah they put a lot of effort into it for an April Fool's joke but I wouldn't.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.920
Did you see the making of trailer?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.160
Because they did that shit in July of last year.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:54.840
They did a making of trailer of a trailer.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:01.640
Well they had a making of little snippet thing that was released the day after that shows

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.880
you how they did it.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.440
No I didn't check like, oh it's April 2nd time to check and see if there's something

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.520
following up.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:10.520
Is this better?

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.520
Yeah.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.520
The date was July.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:13.520
They did that in July.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.320
That's the only thing I cared about in there was when did they do it because I wanted to

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.160
hear them say why they did it but it was July when they were putting it all together.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.600
I was just kind of surprised at that.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.120
Well good job.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.800
But Loki I noticed there was no Tingle in the movie so there's still hope.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:33.520
No I don't think that there was Tingle in the first game either so.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.920
That's alright they can work it in.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:35.920
No they can't.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920
Yeah they can.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.920
Well they can't but I'm not playing him.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.160
Oh moving on.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.360
Yes the legend of me.

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.360
The legend of me?

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.360
The legend of me.

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:51.720
Other April Fool's jokes from around the web, Microsoft actually put together their own

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.860
little thing like they were announcing all these devices that were going to come out

01:01:54.860 --> 01:02:00.440
such as the retro Xbox 360 that had a wood finish on it and the retro controller and

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.520
I thought the hilarious part.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.160
I like how Microsoft can kind of make fun of themselves because the retro controller

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.880
had like a hundred buttons on it.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.880
It looked like a typewriter.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:08.880
It was kind of funny.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.880
And then they announced like a virtual headset and my favorite was Xbox Live the board game.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.360
That was pretty good.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.480
Oh God.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:17.480
What else did we have?

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:24.320
Kotaku did cake kaku for a day or something like not bukkake but cake kaku or something

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.160
like that for a whole day where they were nothing but gaming cakes which was actually

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.480
kind of funny because they do cover a lot of gaming cakes on that blog or at least they

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.540
did in the past year.

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:34.540
What else was there?

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:38.560
Somebody announced My Little Pony for Xbox Live Arcade.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.560
That's awesome.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.840
I heard someone said the EA was doing that.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840
That's awesome.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840
Oh don't forget Wow.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
Oh yeah.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.480
What did Blizzard do this year?

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.880
I know specifically for Wow they introduced the Bard class.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880
That looked hardcore.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880
That was good.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.560
And they had Molten Core the console game.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.560
For the Atari toy 600.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.080
Well did you see how the Bard was supposed to have like guitar with you know like guitar

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.880
hero controls and stuff like that.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.880
I was actually pretty pissed that that was fake because I think the control scheme would

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.920
be stupid but I would like to see Bards in World of Warcraft because Bards are awesome.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:11.400
They had for Starcraft 2 they had Tauren Marines.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.400
Oh yeah.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.400
Nice.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.400
They were beefy.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400
I also like the Guild Wars thing.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400
I thought that was cool.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:20.880
And Lord of the Rings Online had like giant chickens that you had to fight.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.880
But nobody cares because it's Lord of the Rings Online.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.480
And actually speaking of Guild Wars, the Guild Wars wiki and the WoW wiki switched places

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:28.480
for a day.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.720
So you tried to go to WoW wiki and it was giving you Guild War quests.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:32.720
That's awesome.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:33.720
That's great.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.720
And then vice versa.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.720
Brilliant.

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:40.880
And then there was also the Konami Ubisoft one where they had Altera and Metal Gear Solid

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:47.480
4 and they did like an actual video from in-game and stuff with all that going on.

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.040
And what other ones?

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040
Oh.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.480
Dark Tetsuya says Shang Long and Street Fighter IV.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.480
I was just going to say that.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.480
That was funny.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480
I don't know.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:03.840
Oh, Bungie did one where they were showing the Xbox Halo 3 stats, you know how like show

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.640
a little light or whatever where people are playing Halo 3 and apparently it made their

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.560
little cartoon Halo head thing on there.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.560
So I was kind of kind of dumb but I think what else there was.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.080
Creativity from around the web.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.080
Yeah.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.080
What was your favorite prank out of all of them?

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080
I like the Zelda thing.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.600
I think the Zelda trailer kind of trumped everything.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:30.040
I mean even though it wasn't like I wasn't going to fall for it, it's still like the

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.600
quality of it was very good.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.880
I think everybody has their guard up on April 1st.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.360
It would be very hard to fall for a prank.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.880
Did anyone fall for a prank?

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.640
Chatters, did any of you fall for a prank?

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.840
I know some of our listeners fell for that Zelda thing because we got some emails about

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840
it.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.800
I got my boss to fall for a prank.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.120
What was that?

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.400
My review, my work review was on April 1st.

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:52.440
Nice.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.640
And so I was thinking that there was going to be all this stuff but I went in and I was

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:01.360
like well before we start the meeting I have to tell you something really, really important

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.960
and this is bad news for you.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.000
It's really good news for me but I've been offered a job at the Beau Ravage in Biloxi,

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.640
Mississippi as their massage therapist for some sort of reopening thing so I'm going

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.760
to be moving in three weeks and I did it completely deadpan and she just got quiet and looked

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.840
at me and said I'm happy for you and I was like well thank you and also I just completely

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.400
fooled you.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.000
This is at my annual review.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Nice.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.840
But she said that they all got her by, she calls in to check on us every morning and

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.760
that they said that nobody else showed up.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:39.960
The only April Fools prank I played is I went to our guild forum for WoW.

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.320
I went to the guild forum and I posted a post that says why I quit the guild last night

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.320
to go back to Final Fantasy XI and then you open it up and it says yeah right April Fools.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.320
That's clever Rob.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.320
I know it was great.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.560
And the worst part is some of us actually believe you.

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560
I know, I know.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.640
What about all the Rick Rolling stuff that was going on?

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640
Oh God.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.240
Rick Rolling is so old.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:08.080
However, however, there was a clever one that was linked to me of The Muppets.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.040
I was a beaker and that was cool.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:19.520
The best Rick Roll was not beaker but in a second it was not game facts which was evil

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.800
but it was actually Chris Perillo of Locker Gnome from the Screen Savers announcing his

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:31.800
last video podcast because apparently he had a fight with his woman.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:32.800
Right.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.800
His woman.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:34.800
It's always the woman.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.720
Yeah, he just, I'm sorry, I just, he looks away, freeze frame, never going to give you

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.720
up, starts playing.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720
I'm like oh God.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:46.320
I think my favorite April Fools joke other than the Zelda thing had to have been, and

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.720
I know it was a little late for April Fools but the release of Mr. Driller in there online,

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.720
it's so funny because it doesn't work.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:59.400
He's fooled all those people because it's Mr. Driller online and the online portion

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.000
doesn't work.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.960
You remember Mo who was here a few weeks ago who did a cover of Still Alive, remember that?

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:11.080
She actually has a cover of Never Going to Give You Up on YouTube and that's how we found

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080
her actually.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.800
That's how Jake found her to begin with and they call it Chick Rolling if you want to

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800
link that YouTube.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800
Wow.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800
So there it is.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.960
I'm not making that up.

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.320
There's a cover of her doing Never Going to Give You Up.

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320
It's quite good.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.000
See, April Fools, I guess it's about fooling people obviously and yeah, the Zelda thing

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.160
was pretty good but I kind of like things that make me laugh on April Fools Day and

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.840
definitely the Molten Core console thing just made me crack up.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:41.560
Blizzard does good jobs every year with April Fools.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.880
They do good jobs.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:45.280
Let's move on with news because we want to wrap this segment up.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.640
Well, I have our downloadable content stuff.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640
Yay stuff.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:58.200

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.480

For game content, Call of Duty 4, Brighty Map Pack, Two Worlds Curse of Souls, Pinball

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.920
FX, Rocky and Bullwinkle Table.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920
Guess what?

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.400
I owned one for reals.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:21.520
So haha, that's how I got my World Cup soccer.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:27.520
A whole bunch of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol stuff, who cares?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.320
I got to get that game.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:35.600
Themes, Mr. Driller Online, FIFA Street 3, Brazil, England, France, Italy, Germany, Mexico,

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.120
Spain, USA, Australia.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:44.040
Pictures, Major League Gaming Got Frag, Major League Gaming Game Battles, Turok Creatures,

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:49.480
Turok Whiskey Company, Wolf Pack, Variety, Mr. Driller Online, more shit, Call of Duty

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:59.520

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.360
Virtual Console in Europe, Yoshi's Cookie.

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:08.240
In the US we got Cruisin' and we got Wonder Boy, which we've talked about for the Metaboli

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:20.480
thing, there's Imprenium Romanum, Buku Dominoes and Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Sins of a Solar

01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.440
Empire PC demo is out, so there you go.

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.440
Here's the hilarious thing about the Mr. Driller Online theme, is that when you would download

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.200
it on Xbox 360, what the theme is, is just a bunch of red X's.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:38.520
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.800
Let's see, I was going to say also, yeah, PlayStation Network's not going to have much

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.720
for the next few weeks anyway since they're revamping their store and in the meantime

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:52.760
not putting anything up there, so if you want your free still live like you get in Xbox

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.100
360, you're going to have to wait until the 17th, so that sucks.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:00.520
Another game though that you're going to have to wait even longer for is The Force Unleashed,

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:04.960
which was originally going to be a July game, but now it's been pushed all the way to September

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.160
16th, where it's hopefully going to stay.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:14.760
This week though they had some videos showing off the different versions of the game, which

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:18.440
I guess each game is kind of getting their own exclusive things, like for example the

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:25.240
PlayStation 2 and PSP titles will be getting some exclusive story lines and stuff like

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.200
that in the game in the 360 and PS3 versions.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.840
You of course get kick-ass graphics and physics, and then the Wii version they actually have

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:42.920
a battle mode where you can fight different people and also like, you know, Wiimote, lightsaber

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.600
combat and stuff like that, and I believe also the PSP version has some like legacy

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.880
story line modes that you can play through five different story lines through the six

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.080
episodes of the movie, so that's kind of neat.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:11:01.160
Looks like a pretty awesome game, and like I said, September 16th is when we can see

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.160
that in the US.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.560
Alright.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.040
Are you excited about The Force Unleashed?

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040
I actually am.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.520
I'm thinking about picking that up for the 360.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.240
Star Wars games are usually pretty good.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.220
I like Lego Star Wars.

01:11:18.220 --> 01:11:21.280
So go figure, we have people trying to connect to life 365 right now and it's not letting

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.280
them in.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.160
I'm not going to miss this place at all.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.840
The more I think about it, we should have done this a year ago, all right, Rooster Teeth.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.720
You might not know that name, but you definitely know Red vs. Blue, something that they've

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.460
put together for years and years, but you know, they obviously, right, well now they're

01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:42.180
going to do something called Reconstruction.

01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:46.140
They put out a trailer, a little teaser video that's available on YouTube if you search

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:49.560
for Reconstruction Rooster Teeth, you'll find it.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.560
What I find interesting about it though, it's a little bit more serious, at least the trailer

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.320
had a more serious tone, so I guess they're getting away from the funny stuff and maybe

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.520
doing something a little more serious.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.880
I don't know about that.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.760
I mean, every series that they've done has been funny.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760
I guess that's true.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.240
I mean, maybe, I don't know, but it would be interesting if they took the different

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.240
direction.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
It would be interesting.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:14.400
Maybe it'll be a dramedy, like Ally McBeal was drama but funny, well to some.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.200
Yeah, that's debatable.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.240
I never really found it funny.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.240
Neither did anybody else.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.240
I never watched it.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.240
Oh, snap.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.760
She was too skeleton-like.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.400
Yeah, that's every time I look at it.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.640
All right, no more TV critic.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640
Back to gaming news.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.560
Remember when we were talking about the contest for Puzzle Quest, the add-on getting a name?

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560
No.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560
Just kidding.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560
Yes, I do.

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
Rob.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.560
What?

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.160
Is that the name of the new expansion?

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.360
Yes, that's the name.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.360
Try to spell it.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.760
Anyway, they got 500-plus suggestions and-

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.640
That's it, that's actually kind of sad.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.640
Only 500.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.640
I know, right?

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.320
And in the end, they got Revenge of the Plague Lord.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.200
Oh, and I was hoping they would pick Puzzle Quest 1.5 to search for more money.

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.600
Did you submit that?

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.640
No, that's Spaceballs 2.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.680
Ah, yes.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.400
That's actually kind of a dumb title.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.400
I don't know.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.680
It doesn't make me go OMG1.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:19.400
The runners-up was sorceress of Malbec and the scourge of Antharg.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.920
Those are much cooler names, because they have-

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.800
I think I knew an ogre in a D&D game named Antharg.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:28.680
It's like they threw the alphabet into Will It Blend, and they got those names.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.080
Did you actually watch them for that?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.280
The sorceress of Elbec, what was that?

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280
Malbec.

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280
Malbec and the-

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.280
And the scourge of Antharg.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.280
Antharg.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.060
Did you actually watch any of those yet?

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.240
Will It Blend is pretty good, yes.

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.560
I watched the one where they blended a Guitar Hero controller.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.760
I liked the one where they blended the iPhone.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
Pretty awesome.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.600
I heard they dispose of a hobo in that.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:58.200
April Fools, just kidding.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:04.440
Well there's a game that is on Xbox Live Arcade that everybody loves.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.360
And well, they're going to be loving the sequel too.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:10.480
It's Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.060
And it is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, at least that's where we would assume it's going.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:22.240
And this comes to us from the Australian Classifications Board, the OFLC, which has just raided the

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.240
game.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:31.200
So, you know, kind of like the MPA, not the MPAA, but the ESRB here, you know, that is

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.660
kind of their version of that.

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:37.760
So I'm sure, you know, we'll see this at some point, maybe an E3 announcement or something

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:38.760
like that.

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.840
Well when it got spoiled now though, that's got to suck.

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840
Eh, whatever.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.520
At least it's not like Sonic Unleashed.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:51.080
Yeah, that sucks for those guys.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.640
What do you think they're going to change in this game though?

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.960
I kind of like the Wii version, the Wii version was good, I mean that would be a pretty kick-ass

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.680
download game, but I mean, then again, it's the game that's on the Wii, so I don't think

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.160
they could do the same thing.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.280
But like, I didn't know there was a lot else they could do to Geometry Wars, but that Wii

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.280
game was pretty awesome.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.840
Add some new enemies maybe, or something like that, different weapons.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840
I guess.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.320
Maybe they'll have like co-op or competitive mode or something, that would be a big change,

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.200
because they didn't have that in the first one.

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.240
So we'll see.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:29.680
Well we're going to play this song, and long time listeners of our show recognize that

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:36.320
song as Happy Wedding, which is going to introduce a new segment in the show this week called

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.200
Nerds Got Married.

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:41.960
Whenever there's a wedding of note that we want to highlight on the show, we're going

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.680
to say Nerds Got Married.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:49.600
So this week in Nerds Got Married, a listener of Orange Lounge Radio actually got married.

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.360
The Viva Pinata guy, remember the Viva Pinata guy?

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.160
He's actually a listener of the program, he commented on our MySpace.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.960
I think he was mad because we were poking fun at the story, even though that's what

01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.960
we do here.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.440
But the Viva Pinata guy got married.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.480
You might remember in Viva Pinata, he did the diamond sending thing and did a little

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:17.440
note in the game, and they had the wedding, and they did it on a cruise ship, and they

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:22.120
actually had little Viva Pinata creatures on their wedding cake.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:27.160
So congratulations to David and Jen, if you want to see more about the wedding.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:40.560
It's all on David's YouTube channel, which is available at Gears Cast.

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.600
He must also be a big Gears of War player.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600
So there you have it, Nerds Got Married.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.600
Congratulations.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:52.560
I know that song has to do with weddings and stuff, but do you have to use such a shitty

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.560
song?

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.960
I hate that song.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.280
I like to do little throwbacks to our days.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280
It's a Bimani station.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.560
Could you do a better throwback?

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.960
I could throw you out of here.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.920
I could throw my fist in your face.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:03.920
Alright.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.240
Just thought I'd interject there.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Alright, how about this?

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.040
I will allow Dark Soccer to do a proper throwback.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.040
Thank you.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.480
And she will throwback by highlighting a classic game of the week.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:20.960
It also hurts my heart because this is classic now.

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:24.080
So Dark Soccer, what did you pick for the kids this week as your classic game of the

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.080
week?

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.080
Something they must check out?

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:28.120
I picked Pure Awesomeness.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.600
I picked Crazy Taxi on Dreamcast.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600
Awesome.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600
Yeah.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:38.920
This is the best, like one of the best games ever.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.800
Hey, it's time to make some crazy money, are you ready?

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:47.520
Here we go!

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.040
That's not the same song I remember.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.320
No, well, it had Bad Religion and Office of the Dead.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:18:01.600
But yeah, it's basically, not only is it a clever type of beat the clock sort of driving

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600
game.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:10.040
You can do different kinds of stunts in there to increase your fare, you have to play for

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.040
a better rating.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.880
I remember playing in the arcade until I got an S-Class license and I was so freaking happy.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:25.000
The game also is a clever advertising technique for Pizza Hut, Fila, Tower Records, which

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.380
actually I guess it wasn't so clever for Tower Records, Levi's store, and Kentucky Fried

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:30.380
Chicken.

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:34.800
They all had massive product placement in that game.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:40.920
But you had four different drivers, you had your balance driver, you had your fast one,

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:46.960
you've got your best control, and then you had your heavy cabs that can basically run

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.960
over anything in its path.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:53.960
And you had a whole city set up that you could drive through and get in place, and jump out

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:56.960
the buildings and do different things like that.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.960
And on top of that, as you can probably hear as I mentioned in the soundtrack, it had the

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.960
songs from Bad Religion and Office of the Dead had interlock at 10 and 20 10, then the

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:30.960
last song on the radio and not think of this game.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.080
I love this game, I actually think this is one of the better driving games.

01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.480
I'm not so fond of it on the Dreamcast as I am in the arcades, like for me that's the

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.960
home for this game, it was an arcade game, although I will give props to the Dreamcast

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:45.160
version because it had the missions and it had the extra stuff in it.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.160
The missions were hard though.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.880
The missions were actually pretty cool, if I'm just going to bring that up, it trains

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:56.680
you to do different stuff in the game is what the missions are there for, so showing you

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:04.200
how to do dashes and how to toby and crazy stuff, I actually thought the later ones that

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:09.080
had so many interesting ones, like the super long jump and everything, that was kind of

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.080
cool.

01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.080
But this is one of my favorite games ever.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.360
Irene, were you a fan of Crazy Taxi?

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.360
I never played it.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.360
Really?

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.360
Really.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
It's a really fun game actually.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360
I should try.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:23.400
For a driving game it's a lot, it's just different, it's not just NASCAR vroom vroom vroom around

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.400
in a circle, it's pretty fun.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.840
You raise the clock and get crazy money.

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:30.720
Take people to Pizza Hut, how could you not like that?

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.280
Yeah, I'll have to try it sometime.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:36.040
It's actually available on GameTap too, I know I hoard that a lot, but hey, they got

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.040
free games on there.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.040
Well, not free, I guess free.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:41.760
I did like on the later ones though, I did like on the later ones how they had it where

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:46.840
you could play, where you could have multiple people in your car too and do different deliveries

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.260
to different places.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.680
Rasteel UT says, funny that Pizza Hut isn't Pizza Hut anymore, they're Pasta Hut now.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.320
Did they have to change that in later games or something maybe?

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.800
Oh, in the game?

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.800
I don't know.

01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:58.800
Maybe.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:20:59.800
Wasn't that an April Fools joke?

01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.800
Yeah.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800
Oh, perhaps.

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.040
No, they're Wing Street now or whatever.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:10.640
Yeah, Tiger Claw mentions in the game you can't run over people sadly, any attempt they

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.640
always run out of the way.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640
Well, yeah.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.880
But it was sure fun trying.

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:15.880
I'm talking about running into cars.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:16.880
Yeah.

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:19.680
You can run into the cars.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:20.680
I love Crazy Taxi.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.680
I know, me too.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.680
I want to make some crazy money, Rob.

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680
All right.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.160
Well, I got a dollar.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.440
I owe you a dollar.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.440
You should just keep it.

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.440
All right.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.680
Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of our podcast, but there's plenty more to come

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.240
for this, our last week on Live 365.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:43.120
Coming up in part B, we're going to play a game that we started here on Live 365.

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.040
Actually, this game dates all the way back to a show I did on college radio, so this

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.360
game has survived for 10 years.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.520
We're going to play it one last time... Well, not last time, but one more time tonight here

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.240
on Live 365, and then we'll bring it over to All Games in a few weeks.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.960
We're going to play Listless tonight.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.600
The topic for tonight's Listless, so folks can start thinking about what they want to

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:08.440
do here in studio, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440
Oh, God.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:15.520
This is the topic of tonight's Listless, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.200
You guys think about that, and we will cover that in part B of our podcast.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.560
But until then, a break.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.560
See you then.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:28.200
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.200
a week.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:55.720
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
