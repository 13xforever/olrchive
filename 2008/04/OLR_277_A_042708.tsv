7000	13000	We're the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Loco King
14000	19000	Tonight April 27th, 2008, the old classic game Splatterhouse is set to return
19000	22000	Burnout Paradise is getting patched for motorcycle riding
22000	26000	And are arcade ticket redemption machines a form of illegal gambling?
26000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	37000	And welcome to another week of the program that Bobby Blackwolf had to censor three times tonight
37000	41000	Orange Lounge Radio, live at www.allgames.com
41000	44000	Every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
44000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always to talk about video games
48000	50000	Video gaming, gaming culture, and gamer lifestyle
50000	53000	My BFF in the world, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura
53000	54000	Hi
54000	55000	How are you?
55000	56000	I'm tired
56000	57000	Tired?
57000	58000	Because of the sun
58000	60000	Tired cat is very tired?
60000	62000	Sleepy Jamie is sleepy
62000	64000	I know, it's very, we have heat issues here
64000	66000	Because obviously, you know, our show is based in Sacramento, California
66000	68000	And we're just starting to get into summer
68000	70000	I think it's only like 90 degrees out
70000	73000	And yes, even though it's late April, it's starting to get into summer
73000	75000	It's what, 90 degrees out?
75000	77000	And yeah, it's getting very hot here in the studio
77000	80000	And we're trying to buy more fans to help with the problem
80000	81000	83
81000	82000	It's only 83 outside
82000	84000	Hence me saying not even
84000	85000	Lord
85000	86000	No, it's 90
86000	87000	Oh, okay
87000	88000	It was 83 last time I checked
88000	90000	Because I was going to say, when we get into June and July
90000	91000	We're going to have 105
91000	92000	However
92000	93000	And I'm going to cry
93000	96000	However, the forecast says that it's going to be 83 on Monday
96000	98000	And then in the 70s, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
98000	99000	Huh
99000	101000	Well, thank you for the weather update
101000	104000	You know, people talk about the weather when there's nothing better to talk about
104000	107000	But we have video games and other things to talk about
107000	109000	Right, Tech Master Loki, my other BFF
109000	111000	Uh, yeah, how are you doing?
111000	112000	I'm doing fine
112000	113000	Good
113000	115000	I got a large soda today because
115000	116000	You knew it was going to be damn hot
116000	117000	It's hot
117000	118000	It is very hot
118000	122000	And I'm mad as all hell because I bought a box fan from Target
122000	124000	A 20-inch box fan and it's broken
124000	126000	And it was cracked inside the box
126000	127000	Like somebody else returned it
127000	130000	Box fans aren't very, uh, complex
130000	132000	You know, just switch on, go
132000	134000	Ugh, makes me mad
134000	137000	At least we have the nice oscillating fan that is doing a decent job
137000	140000	I think Jamie benefits more than the rest of us for that one
140000	141000	Yes, I do
141000	143000	You know what, it's not oscillating anymore
143000	145000	It's pointed on the back of my neck
145000	147000	God damn it, did that thing break too?
147000	149000	No, I think when I tried to turn the ionizer off
149000	151000	I think I stopped the oscillator too, so
151000	153000	It's going to keep blowing on the back of my neck
153000	154000	I'll fix that
154000	157000	I was going to go back and fix that while DarkSakura talks about her gaming week
157000	159000	My gaming week
159000	162000	And just in time with the theme music
162000	164000	That's what I get when I don't hit the stop button
164000	166000	Happens a lot here on this show
166000	169000	I've had a very, very, very, very busy
169000	171000	Lots of stuff going on week
171000	174000	So I haven't gotten to play much other than Ragnarok
174000	178000	But I'm still trying to get a ZSNES to download
178000	181000	So that I can play, um, uh
181000	183000	Seiken Densetsu 3
183000	186000	And Dan was supposed to bring me back Mario Kart tonight
186000	188000	But I'm sort of like meh about it
188000	191000	Because we've already had access to the game for like a week
191000	194000	So I'm kinda meh
194000	198000	Although lately, like, I really, really want to play Street Fighter Alpha 2
198000	204000	You just, you're going in and digging in the old classics
204000	207000	Are you trying to find some new classic games of the week for the future?
207000	211000	Well, I've actually been sort of wanting us to do our thing
211000	212000	Right, our thing
212000	215000	So I've been thinking, because we're actually going to be cleaning out the vault
215000	217000	Because we're getting a roommate
217000	221000	But I was thinking, um, once all that's set up
221000	225000	I wanted to bust out the Dreamcast and get on some Street Fighter 3 too
225000	226000	You know, as well
226000	227000	Good times
227000	229000	And, uh, third impact on Dreamcast
229000	231000	Alright
231000	235000	Well, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of classic gaming in your future
235000	238000	Let's move, I know, exciting stuff
238000	241000	Let's move over to Loki and see if there's been a lot of classic gaming in his week
241000	244000	Yes, I played a classic game called Saints Row
244000	247000	Uh, I don't know, it's not really that classic anymore
247000	249000	Um, it's fun
249000	252000	You know, we're still, actually we downloaded a new map this week
252000	255000	Because we're bored with the three that they have
255000	258000	So we wanted the fourth one, the fourth one's okay
258000	260000	It's been out for, what, years now
260000	263000	But, you know, with the internet being blocked at our work
263000	266000	I had to kind of jerry-rig something in order to get to work
266000	272000	But, uh, that was all to just kill time until Grand Theft Auto IV
272000	276000	Which I, uh, sneaked an early copy of
276000	280000	And, um, what more do I need to see?
280000	284000	I've been looking for this game for, what, years now?
284000	286000	Since Grand Theft Auto III?
286000	288000	Oh, probably since, like, you know, last Grand Theft Auto
288000	289000	San Andreas, yeah
289000	290000	Okay
290000	292000	It's fucking awesome, I mean
292000	295000	It's, um, there, okay, let me just
295000	297000	Since the game is, you know, pretty awesome
297000	300000	I'll just, you know, mention my gripes of the game
300000	302000	I don't like the soundtrack, I think it's lame
302000	306000	Um, I guess I've been spoiled with, like, Vice City and Grand Theft Auto III
306000	308000	But I hate the radio stations in, uh, IV
308000	310000	I think they're crap
310000	316000	Um, let's see, I don't like, um
316000	319000	I don't know, that might be just it
319000	322000	Um, oh, I don't like how you can't skip the intro in the beginning of the game
322000	326000	Because you have to, it has to kind of boot up, I guess, a little bit
326000	328000	Um, before it gets into loading and stuff
328000	331000	You just can't bypass all that little cutscene stuff
331000	337000	Um, uh, oh, and I don't like the fact that I don't know any cheat codes yet
337000	341000	Because half the fun of Grand Theft Auto was when you didn't want to actually play through the story
341000	345000	As you're cheating like crazy and just getting rocket launchers and blowing everything up
345000	349000	I kind of miss that, but I'm sure that'll come out eventually once the game gets released
349000	353000	A couple questions, is the game worthy of the perfect 10 reviews it's receiving left and right?
353000	357000	Probably, I mean, I don't, it's not perfect
357000	361000	But, I mean, it's damn good, I'd say give it a 9-8 or 9-9
361000	363000	But nothing's perfect
363000	367000	Um, what is the most obscene thing you've done in the game so far?
367000	369000	The most obscene thing?
369000	373000	Like, thing that is going to shock people like Hot Coffee
373000	375000	Thing that is going to make Lord Voldemort
375000	378000	And if you haven't been listening to our show for a while
378000	381000	Lord Voldemort is our nickname for somebody else
381000	384000	A very infamous lawyer in the gaming community
384000	388000	What is, like, the thing you've done that would piss Lord Voldemort off more than anything?
388000	390000	I haven't really done that much in the game
390000	393000	I mean, there really hasn't been anything too controversial, I killed a guy
393000	396000	And we dumped his body in a river, but
396000	400000	I mean, well, other than the countless people that have been running over my car
400000	404000	Um, I would say it's a lot more realistic
404000	407000	So, like, you can shoot someone in the leg and they start hobbling away and stuff
407000	411000	Um, and also, um
411000	413000	Oh, I went to the strip club in there
413000	416000	And they have, like, you know, pretty explicit lap dances
416000	419000	Of course, no one's actually naked in there, but, you know, pasties or whatever
419000	422000	That's pretty explicit, I mean
422000	425000	They have, like, you can do three different lap dances
425000	427000	As it goes on there
427000	431000	And one of them has, like, two girls, like, making out on top of you
431000	433000	So I guess that's pretty explicit
433000	436000	And there's a girlfriend you get in the game in the very beginning there
436000	439000	And you can go in for hot coffee, I guess
439000	441000	But it doesn't show anything
441000	443000	And she actually screams, like, the weirdest things
443000	445000	Wait, do they actually call it hot coffee?
445000	447000	Yeah
447000	449000	And the achievement, you get the achievement for that
449000	451000	For warm coffee, which is funny
451000	455000	Um, I did see, um, in the video review from IGN
455000	459000	There was a scene, I'm assuming from, um
459000	462000	A hooker you can pick up, but it showed, like, a hooker, like, in your lap
462000	464000	Bouncing up and down on you in a car
464000	466000	So that's pretty explicit, I guess
466000	469000	But nothing super over the top yet
469000	471000	Um
471000	474000	Apparently, I did get four stars one time
474000	479000	For riding a motorcycle onto the tarmac for the airport
479000	482000	Apparently the police frown upon that kind of behavior
482000	484000	I'm like, oh crap, four stars
484000	486000	So, that wasn't good
486000	488000	Um
488000	490000	But overall, it's a good game
490000	492000	Very, um
492000	494000	Sometimes it can get annoying because the characters
494000	497000	There's a lot that uses that cell phone in the game
497000	500000	And a lot of characters will call you to do different missions and stuff
500000	502000	And if you don't answer the phone or if you don't do their mission
502000	506000	They, like, you have, like, a percentage of how much they like you
506000	509000	And that'll go down if, um, you don't do their mission
509000	511000	So the game doesn't let you just do the open sandbox thing?
511000	514000	Because one thing I loved about Grand Theft Auto was just, like, you know
514000	515000	I didn't even have to pay attention to the story
515000	516000	Not necessarily
516000	517000	You can do the open sandbox thing
517000	521000	There's actually a mode on the phone that turned it into sleep mode
521000	524000	And that'll turn all the, um, in-game, like, story stuff off
524000	527000	And then you just go and do whatever
527000	529000	So that's kinda cool
529000	533000	Um, but yeah, so, pretty much, just the radio
533000	535000	The stations are kinda retarded on there
535000	537000	You can watch TV, which is kinda funny
537000	538000	You have, like, fake TV shows on there
538000	539000	Nice
539000	542000	Um, and
542000	544000	I don't know, that's pretty much it for right now
544000	546000	Let's go to the chat room
546000	548000	chat.orangelaungeradio.com
548000	551000	We always invite our listeners to come join us live and participate in our program
551000	554000	We read chat comments, take emails, and phone calls later on in the show
554000	556000	First comment tonight from Sephiroth1215
556000	560000	After reading the soundtrack on wiki, the Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack does look like it sucks
560000	562000	Too bad, cause I love the San Andreas one
562000	565000	But, hey, I guess, you know, the best thing about it is
565000	570000	Since it is on the Playstation 3 and 360 custom soundtracks, so
570000	573000	Uh, earlier Loki said there's no such thing as a perfect game
573000	576000	J-Rod says Silent Hill 1 is perfect, to me anyway
576000	577000	No, it's not
577000	578000	Well, yeah, maybe to one person
578000	582000	And, you know, be honest, this is, it's the perfect Grand Theft Auto, I think, for me
582000	585000	And I haven't even delved into, like, a lot of the online stuff yet
585000	586000	Because, you know
586000	588000	You can do custom soundtracks
588000	589000	You can do custom soundtracks
589000	590000	So you can fix your major gripe right there
590000	592000	Yeah, exactly, I just didn't like, cause I mean
592000	594000	In 3 even, it had, like, some pretty cool stuff
594000	597000	Like, they had a station that was all electro music and that kind of thing
597000	598000	And that was really cool
598000	601000	And, like, in Vice City, man, all the stations were awesome there
601000	604000	It's just, there's a lot of music that I've never heard of in there
604000	607000	And I guess it's kind of cool that it's new and exclusive to the game
607000	610000	But at the same time, I haven't heard of it and I don't really care for it
610000	614000	Tigerclaw wants to know if you've explored the comedy club area of the game
614000	616000	I haven't gotten to a comedy club
616000	620000	The only thing I've gotten to right now is, like, a cabaret club
620000	621000	And that sucks
621000	623000	Cabarets shit
623000	625000	Do they have a burlesque show? That would be pretty awesome
625000	627000	Um, I don't know if they have a burlesque show
627000	630000	The one time I went in there, they had this really crappy magician
630000	634000	The second time I went in there, they had some guy rolling around on the stage
634000	636000	With doing some sort of western thing
636000	638000	Western monologue
638000	640000	And then, you can, um
640000	643000	One of the first dates you go on is bowling
643000	645000	So you can go bowl, which is kind of cool
645000	648000	They have darts, you can do billiards
648000	650000	They've got, um
650000	651000	Dance Dance Revolution
651000	655000	They have a game that's like, I think it's supposed to be like Qbert in there
655000	658000	I don't know
658000	661000	I gotta go for another viewpoint
661000	664000	Dark Sakura, any interest in Grand Theft Auto 4 at all?
664000	665000	No
665000	666000	Why not?
666000	668000	I just don't like those games
668000	669000	They're not fun to me
669000	672000	Is it not fun because there's no point?
672000	673000	They're kind of boring
673000	674000	Yeah?
674000	676000	Senseless violence not your thing?
676000	678000	I like senseless violence, I just think they're boring
678000	679000	I see
679000	681000	I see, I like, I agree with Loki
681000	683000	You gotta open up the cheat codes
683000	685000	Because the best part of Grand Theft Auto, at least the last one
685000	687000	Or I think it was Vice City I was playing that had this
687000	690000	There was the code that would just make the cars appear from the heavens
690000	693000	And you could just make like 80 cars pile up
693000	697000	And then fire a rocket at them and just make the biggest explosions in the world
697000	700000	That was my favorite part, because fire is awesome
700000	702000	My gaming week
702000	706000	You know, I kind of went and decided to go back to PSP gaming
706000	710000	Like, you know, I haven't been showing the PSP a lot of love here on the show with games
710000	713000	And after my trip recently where I was playing Final Fantasy 1
713000	716000	I said, I'm gonna go get Final Fantasy 2 on the PSP
716000	718000	So I did that, I went and got Final Fantasy 2
718000	720000	Which, you know, very similar to the remake of 1
720000	723000	It's high def, you know, pretty graphics
723000	724000	Fun to play
724000	726000	Loading times surprised me a little bit
726000	729000	I don't know if it's just because my PSP is old and maybe I need to get a mini
729000	733000	But the loading times kind of surprised me how slow they are in some points
733000	735000	But it didn't really detract from the experience
735000	738000	It's just that I noticed it, which, you know, says something there
738000	741000	But the other game I've actually been playing a lot more of is Patapon
741000	742000	I bought that game
742000	746000	And it really was not what I thought it was going to be
746000	748000	I expected it to be like a straight up music game
748000	750000	And certainly music is one element of it
750000	753000	But it was more of like a strategy type of game
753000	754000	I don't know how to say it
754000	757000	It's like a, you know, basically here's the gist of the game
757000	760000	For those who haven't played it is that, you know, the screen flashes in rhythm
760000	762000	Like you'll hear a drum beat that goes
762000	763000	Do, do, do
763000	767000	And then you hit the drums, which are the buttons on the PSP
767000	770000	You only get two drums to start, but you get more later on
770000	774000	You can, you know, hit the drums to issue commands to your little army
774000	775000	So you might go
775000	777000	Pata, pata, pata, pon
777000	778000	And that makes them move forward
778000	779000	Or you might go
779000	780000	Pon, pon, pata, pon
780000	781000	And that makes them attack the enemy
781000	784000	So not only are you having to think about the music
784000	786000	But you're having to think about, okay, what do I want to have them do next
786000	787000	Do I want to have them march forward
787000	788000	Do I want to have them attack
788000	789000	Do I want to have them retreat
789000	790000	Do I want to have them defend
790000	792000	You know, what do I want to have them do
792000	794000	So, that was kind of interesting
794000	796000	But, I'll tell you what
796000	798000	The tutorial in the game, not so great
798000	800000	Because it took me forever to figure out what was going on
800000	803000	I was like, why isn't my freaking army listening to me
803000	806000	And it took me like a minute to get the hang of the game
806000	808000	Like, I think I needed it to kind of show me a little more
808000	810000	Maybe I'm just stupid or old or something
810000	812000	But it took me a little bit to get the hang of
812000	814000	But then once I got in it, okay
814000	817000	And it's kind of cool that you can slowly build your army up
817000	821000	And there's that whole strategy of making the new characters
821000	823000	And what you want to equip them with
823000	826000	Or if you're feeling lazy, you just have the game auto-equip them for you
826000	829000	I think it's a pretty decent price for 20 bucks
829000	831000	It's a decent buy, so definitely check it out
831000	832000	It's a good price
832000	834000	The other game I've been playing this week is on Xbox Live Arcade
834000	836000	I actually bought the full version of Lost Cities
836000	838000	Which is the new card game
838000	840000	And I kind of went into it with very low expectations
840000	842000	Because I was thinking it was going to be another one of those games
842000	844000	That was just very complicated
844000	845000	Like, Catan
845000	847000	Although Catan's a great game
847000	849000	I just never got the hang of it
849000	850000	And it's just too much for me
850000	852000	Because I don't play a lot of those types of board games
852000	854000	And I don't have a lot of
854000	856000	I think the easiest way to learn those types of games
856000	857000	Is to have friends that play them
857000	859000	Because I think friends teaching you how to play those games
859000	861000	Is much easier than the Xbox trying to teach you
861000	864000	And so I had the hardest time trying to learn Catan
864000	866000	Because I didn't really play with anyone else that knew it
866000	868000	And so I was thinking a lot of Lost Cities, I'm probably not going to get it
868000	870000	But the card game is actually pretty simplistic
870000	873000	Yet, you know, one of those games that has a lot of depth to it
873000	875000	So I was kind of surprised
875000	878000	The only thing is, I'm not sure
878000	881000	You know, when all's said and done
881000	884000	There's not a lot of difference between Lost Cities and Uno
884000	886000	They're both card games
886000	890000	They're both, you know, they have the camera support
890000	893000	They both are pretty quick to play
893000	895000	Granted, Lost Cities has a little more of strategy
895000	898000	But what is it? It's a virtual deck of cards, right?
898000	902000	So I'm not sure why Sierra justifies the extra $5
902000	904000	And charges $10 for Lost Cities
904000	906000	Because there's nothing else there
906000	909000	Like, you know what, unlockable art, woohoo
909000	912000	You know, there's not a lot to really justify that extra price
912000	914000	So like if I was a brand new Xbox owner
914000	916000	And I wanted a card game, I'd go for Uno first
916000	918000	But Lost Cities isn't bad
918000	922000	It's just, you know, maybe a little bit overpriced
922000	925000	I imagine it's one of those games that's going to go on sale in six months
925000	926000	So we'll see what happens
926000	928000	But I did have fun with it
928000	930000	And I'm going to try to play some online matches
930000	932000	Although I'm sure I'll get my ass handed to me
932000	934000	Because I guess there is more strategy in Lost Cities
934000	936000	Unlike Uno
936000	938000	How can I describe Lost Cities real quick?
938000	941000	Basically, you're trying to make numerical sequences from 2 to 10
941000	944000	On five different colors which represent cities
944000	948000	And you get, if you are going to start building on a color
948000	950000	You have to make a 20 point investment
950000	952000	And you have to hope that you play enough cards
952000	955000	That will add up to 20 or over by the time the deck is out
955000	958000	Well, in addition to those, there are these multiplier cards
958000	959000	That you can play first
959000	960000	They're called investment cards
960000	964000	And you can double, triple, or quadruple the amount of points that you'll earn
964000	968000	But you're also quadrupling the amount of points that you sacrifice to open up the city
968000	970000	So it's kind of interesting
970000	974000	Katamari's Forever says in chat
974000	976000	Except Uno is appealing to housewives and school children
976000	978000	And Lost Cities is for the Uber hardcore
978000	982000	That may be true, but it still doesn't justify the extra price to me
982000	983000	You know what I mean?
983000	985000	It doesn't seem like there's
985000	988000	Essentially, they're both decks of cards as games
988000	991000	It's just one has a slightly more complicated rule set
991000	994000	That appeals to a more hardcore audience, I don't know
994000	997000	Act Def says Strip Uno on Xbox Live with a cam
997000	999000	Well, you could play Strip Lost Cities too, I guess
999000	1001000	I'm not sure exactly what the rules for that would be
1001000	1004000	You don't need a webcam and an Xbox to play Strip Uno
1004000	1005000	That's true
1005000	1009000	You could just have a bunch of people in the house and booze and then be naked
1009000	1011000	That's probably better anyways
1011000	1015000	Real in-person naked is better
1015000	1018000	Then you can see HooHoos and HaHa's IRL
1018000	1022000	But there's some people in this world who shouldn't be naked
1022000	1028000	And those are the people playing Strip Uno on Xbox Live, probably
1028000	1030000	Yeah, but they probably don't have pictures of themselves
1030000	1032000	They're probably hired like a model
1032000	1034000	Boobies
1034000	1040000	I've got to wonder if like on XTube or Pornotube or any of those sites
1040000	1045000	If there is like a taped Strip Uno game or something that's on those sites
1045000	1048000	I don't know why I have that curious thought
1048000	1052000	But you know how I'm thinking of people using their webcams
1052000	1055000	Like on Yahoo Webcam or whatever to do nasty things
1055000	1058000	Well, why not take it one step further and upload it on the internet
1058000	1060000	For other fellow perverts to enjoy it
1060000	1067000	I'm just wondering how Strip Uno would work since it takes so long to do one game
1067000	1073000	Maybe it's like if you do a draw four then you have to remove four articles of clothing or something
1073000	1074000	That might work
1074000	1076000	Or you know, a draw two you remove two things
1076000	1079000	That could be the thing is that if you get a draw four and play it on you
1079000	1083000	Then either you draw four cards or you gotta take something off
1083000	1085000	Like it could be a choice thing
1085000	1087000	That might be interesting
1087000	1088000	That would be interesting
1088000	1090000	Not that we're encouraging people out of play
1090000	1092000	No, I don't think it should be a choice thing
1092000	1094000	I think you should just have to
1094000	1097000	Alright, anyhow, we better
1097000	1100000	Gerardo Mo's laughing my ass off
1100000	1103000	He says, Gerardo Mo says, I love Jamie's take on this
1103000	1107000	She always is here to give us a refreshing perspective from a female point of view
1107000	1109000	Boobs are great
1111000	1113000	Anyhow, that's our gaming week
1113000	1115000	Let's get into housekeeping tonight
1115000	1120000	Hey, we got the Grand Theft Auto for Xbox 360 Elite Contest still going on
1120000	1123000	And you procrastinators, contest entries are due next week
1123000	1126000	And I'm going to tell you what, we have not gotten a lot of entries
1126000	1128000	I don't know if people are just taking their time because they want to make
1128000	1130000	You know, they want to do a really, really good job
1130000	1131000	Which I can respect
1131000	1133000	So, you know, maybe they're going to wait until the last minute
1133000	1136000	But I'm telling you what, you know, it doesn't take a whole lot
1136000	1140000	And you could win a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite
1140000	1148000	And it's one of, I think, eight like rare Grand Theft Auto 4 custom paint job type systems
1148000	1152000	That was given from Gamerscore blog to All Games Radio
1152000	1153000	Let me remind you how it works
1153000	1156000	We went over it last week, but I'll say it one more time
1156000	1159000	We're going to have a bunch of people submit to us little radio things
1159000	1162000	Like, you know how Grand Theft Auto has the little radio stuff in the game?
1162000	1165000	How is it in Grand Theft Auto 4? Lots of funny parodies and things that you hear on the radio
1165000	1167000	Lots of funny commercials
1167000	1170000	Well, what we want you to do is we want you to make one of those commercials
1170000	1172000	But about Orange Lounge Radio
1172000	1174000	And for the other shows participating in this whole thing
1174000	1176000	Like, for instance, All Games Interactive
1176000	1177000	We want you to do one about them
1177000	1179000	Bobby Black Wolf, one about him
1179000	1181000	You know, Video Game Outsiders, one about them
1181000	1184000	And so on and so on for all these shows that are participating
1184000	1189000	And if you want a full list, it's available on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and AllGames.com
1189000	1191000	And yes, you can enter at more than one site
1191000	1193000	But you can only be the final qualifier for one
1193000	1197000	So we're going to pick a few that will be voted on by our audience
1197000	1201000	And the winning one that's voted on next week will be the winner
1201000	1205000	They're going to get from All Games a $25 gift certificate to the All Games store
1205000	1208000	And an All Games shirt just for qualifying for the final round
1208000	1212000	And then they're going to move on to the final round where they will compete against the final entries from all the other shows
1212000	1215000	And the community at large is going to pick their favorites
1215000	1218000	And that will be it
1218000	1223000	So one entry will win the official Xbox 360 Elite
1223000	1227000	Based on Grand Theft Auto IV from GamerScoreBlog and All Games Radio
1227000	1230000	And hey, there's also a second and third prize
1230000	1231000	I didn't talk about this last week
1231000	1236000	But second place is the Grand Theft Auto IV game for whatever system you want
1236000	1239000	And that's courtesy of Mediaspective, one of the other shows on All Games Radio
1239000	1243000	Third prize, $20 points card for your system of choice
1243000	1248000	From the Bobby Black Wolf show, the show that precedes us live here on All Games Radio
1248000	1250000	So, 23 bucks
1250000	1252000	And Loki is ineligible for the rules
1252000	1253000	So you don't have to worry about competing against him
1253000	1255000	Although he really wants it
1255000	1257000	He really wants it, but he can't have it
1257000	1259000	Maybe next time
1259000	1261000	Sorry, Loki, them's the rules
1261000	1263000	What can I say?
1263000	1267000	Alright, so if you want to send in your entries, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
1267000	1269000	Just use our general email address
1269000	1271000	We're separating all the entries in another folder
1271000	1273000	Or, if you don't have fancy MP3 recording stuff
1273000	1275000	But you just have a really good idea
1275000	1277000	That might be good enough to win
1277000	1279000	1-877-GAME-OLR
1279000	1280000	Whenever we're not live
1280000	1282000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
1282000	1284000	You can do that either way you want
1284000	1286000	So, there you have it
1286000	1289000	So we hope to get some more entries this week
1289000	1291000	And set people on fire
1291000	1293000	Anyway, we listened to one today
1293000	1294000	And I don't think we're going to play it tonight
1294000	1296000	We'll play it for you guys next week
1296000	1297000	We listened to one today
1297000	1299000	Somebody did it out there just for fun
1299000	1301000	Because unfortunately he lived in Europe
1301000	1303000	And unfortunately our friends overseas are ineligible
1303000	1305000	Because it's an NTSC console
1305000	1307000	He lives in Belgium to be specific
1307000	1308000	And sent us a commercial
1308000	1309000	And I'll tell you what
1309000	1310000	It was so funny
1310000	1312000	I cried, laughing
1312000	1313000	We should use it as our example
1313000	1315000	It was great
1315000	1316000	For what people should do
1316000	1317000	I know, but at the same time
1317000	1319000	I don't want 10 copies of that
1319000	1321000	For people to come up with their own original thing
1321000	1322000	Makes sense, right?
1322000	1323000	So we'll play it next week
1323000	1324000	When it's almost over
1324000	1326000	And that way you can hear
1326000	1327000	A really good one
1327000	1328000	And then we'll play the other
1328000	1330000	Qualifiers for you guys
1330000	1332000	Pretty soon
1332000	1333000	Alright
1333000	1334000	NintendoManiac64 says
1334000	1336000	Does it have to be MP3?
1336000	1338000	No, you can use AAC, Wave
1338000	1340000	Well, Wave might blow up our inbox
1340000	1342000	As long as Adobe Audition can open it
1342000	1344000	Or Winamp, we'll play it
1344000	1346000	Just try not to blow up our inbox
1346000	1348000	That's all
1348000	1349000	Alright
1349000	1351000	That's going to do it for housekeeping
1351000	1352000	If you're not already there
1352000	1353000	Join our live journal
1353000	1354000	Join our MySpace
1354000	1356000	Join our Facebook
1356000	1357000	Go to our website
1357000	1359000	OrangeLaunchRadio.com
1359000	1360000	And listen to some gaming news
1360000	1361000	Courtesy of Loki
1361000	1362000	So yes
1362000	1364000	Part of a deal that
1364000	1366000	EA had with
1366000	1367000	Milton Bradley
1367000	1369000	They will be publishing
1369000	1371000	Monopoly
1371000	1374000	For the Wii, Playstation 2, and Xbox 360
1374000	1376000	I think it's kind of funny because
1376000	1378000	EA is trying to get a
1378000	1380000	Monopoly on sports games
1380000	1381000	Oh
1381000	1382000	Karma
1382000	1383000	It's funny
1383000	1384000	Har har
1384000	1385000	I see what you did there
1385000	1387000	But apparently this is going to be
1387000	1389000	A sped up version of the original game
1389000	1392000	With some interactive minigames thrown in
1392000	1394000	And
1394000	1395000	I don't know
1395000	1397000	Doesn't really look like
1397000	1399000	There's going to be a PS3 version at all
1399000	1401000	It's Monopoly
1401000	1402000	What can I say?
1402000	1403000	That makes sense because
1403000	1404000	Monopoly never ends
1404000	1406000	So there needs to be some type of sped up version
1406000	1407000	I mean Monopoly can go
1407000	1408000	I mean Monopoly does end I suppose
1408000	1410000	But it can go on forever
1410000	1411000	I'm not even wrong
1411000	1412000	I mean if this came out on like
1412000	1413000	Xbox Live Arcade or something
1413000	1414000	I'd probably pick it up
1414000	1415000	But it's not
1415000	1417000	Like it doesn't sound like it is
1417000	1419000	Considering it's going to be on Wii and Playstation 2 as well
1419000	1421000	It really doesn't sound like it could be on Xbox Live Arcade
1421000	1423000	It could do retail versions of
1423000	1424000	I mean look at Puzzle Quest
1424000	1425000	Okay true
1425000	1426000	I mean anything's possible
1426000	1427000	But I don't know
1427000	1429000	Doesn't it seem likely that maybe that's not the route they're going?
1430000	1431000	Well it is EA
1431000	1433000	They like whoring their shit out so
1433000	1434000	I don't know
1434000	1435000	I don't know
1435000	1437000	Hey maybe it'll support webcams on 360
1437000	1439000	Then you can play Strip Monopoly
1439000	1440000	How does that sound?
1440000	1441000	Good times
1441000	1442000	Not as much fun as in real life
1442000	1443000	And if you play Strip Monop-
1443000	1444000	Monop-
1444000	1445000	Monop-
1445000	1449000	Monopoly you'll just get bored and pissed off at everybody else before anyone's naked
1452000	1454000	Monopoly is kind of boring after a while
1454000	1456000	Strip Monopoly would have to have like lab dances
1457000	1458000	No seriously
1458000	1460000	Because you know how you win all of your money
1460000	1462000	But you have to have the option of being able to spend it
1462000	1463000	On getting someone to get naked
1463000	1465000	Okay here's how you play Strip Monopoly
1465000	1466000	Here's my idea for Strip Monopoly
1466000	1469000	You replace the chance and community chest cards
1469000	1470000	Like you know
1470000	1471000	The kind of stuff in there was like lame
1471000	1472000	Like it was like
1472000	1474000	You win second place in a beauty contest
1474000	1475000	Collect ten dollars right
1475000	1476000	Remember that stuff
1476000	1478000	You need to replace those with x-rated things
1480000	1481000	Like
1481000	1484000	You won second place in a crotchless underpants contest
1484000	1485000	That's right
1485000	1487000	Now it's time to show your community chest
1489000	1490000	Luxury tax
1490000	1491000	Luxury tax
1492000	1493000	Anyhow
1493000	1496000	So Monopoly's coming out on all those systems
1496000	1498000	Do you think other board games to follow
1498000	1501000	Can we strip risk in our future
1501000	1503000	Well remember I think they were talking
1503000	1506000	You know and they were also talking about making movies of these things too
1506000	1508000	So god I mean
1508000	1511000	Battleship would be pretty cool I guess
1511000	1512000	I don't know
1512000	1514000	Board games have been around forever I mean
1515000	1517000	So much you can really do that's different
1517000	1520000	It's been done like fifty times already
1520000	1522000	Gerardo says in chat
1522000	1524000	There would be cheap hotels in Strip Monopoly
1524000	1526000	You know what I would like to see as
1527000	1528000	You get houses
1528000	1530000	And then you have a by the hour motel
1530000	1531000	That you build
1531000	1532000	Yeah
1532000	1533000	You know what I would like
1533000	1536000	Oh that'd be funny Monopoly Red Light District Edition
1536000	1537000	Or something like that
1538000	1539000	I would like to see
1539000	1540000	And this is
1540000	1541000	I don't think this is Milton Bradley
1541000	1543000	But I would like to see them do a
1543000	1546000	Like Xbox Live Arcade version of Heroes Quest
1546000	1548000	Remember that game was kind of like a halfway between
1548000	1550000	Like a board game in Dungeons and Dragons
1550000	1551000	Oh yeah kind of yeah yeah
1551000	1552000	Or what was that other game
1552000	1554000	They had another game that was like something with
1554000	1555000	Volcanoes or something like that
1555000	1557000	And they had little marbles that you could roll down
1557000	1558000	And they would
1558000	1559000	Marble Madness
1559000	1560000	No it wasn't Marble Madness
1560000	1561000	I don't know
1561000	1564000	Marble Madness had things that shot balls
1567000	1568000	Let's see
1568000	1569000	What was it
1569000	1571000	Oh actdeft in chat said
1571000	1573000	Risk conquer the world without your pants
1573000	1575000	Hey they were bringing out strip DDR
1575000	1577000	That made me think of pantsless rage
1578000	1579000	Alright anyhow
1579000	1580000	Forget it
1580000	1582000	Now the chat room is just going to light up with
1582000	1584000	Strip insert board game here
1584000	1585000	It's not funny anymore
1585000	1587000	Although strip ants in your pants is kind of funny
1589000	1590000	Yeah they dump the ants in your pants
1590000	1591000	And you strip to get them out
1591000	1593000	Strip don't wake daddy
1596000	1597000	Strip hungry hungry hippo
1597000	1598000	Alright forget it
1598000	1599000	Rob
1599000	1600000	What
1600000	1601000	Rob
1601000	1602000	How about more news
1602000	1603000	Let's move on and get away from
1603000	1604000	Such a
1604000	1605000	Such
1605000	1606000	Silly
1606000	1607000	Teehee
1607000	1608000	Nudity chat
1608000	1609000	But naked is great
1609000	1610000	Let's get away from
1610000	1611000	Teehee nudity chat
1611000	1612000	And talk about violence
1612000	1613000	Woohoo
1613000	1614000	And
1614000	1615000	You gotta love
1615000	1617000	A classic violent franchise
1617000	1618000	Called Splatterhouse
1618000	1619000	You remember Splatterhouse
1619000	1620000	Yes it was for
1620000	1621000	Turbo Graphics 16
1621000	1623000	Slash PC Engine
1623000	1624000	Because the main guy
1624000	1626000	Looked like a rip off of Jason
1626000	1627000	I know
1627000	1629000	And that game goes sort of annoying sometimes
1629000	1630000	Well guess what
1630000	1631000	On the latest cover
1631000	1632000	Of EGM
1632000	1633000	They're talking about
1633000	1635000	35 different retro revivals
1635000	1636000	And right there on the cover
1636000	1638000	Splatterhouse
1638000	1639000	Sweet
1639000	1640000	So Splatterhouse apparently
1640000	1643000	Is going to be coming back
1643000	1644000	For a new
1644000	1645000	New wave
1645000	1647000	On all the next gen consoles
1647000	1649000	Not a lot else known
1649000	1650000	About the game at this time
1650000	1652000	But I suppose when this magazine
1652000	1653000	Starts floating around out there
1653000	1654000	We'll know a little bit more about it
1656000	1657000	Well
1657000	1658000	It was
1658000	1659000	It was
1659000	1660000	The story though
1660000	1661000	Was fairly unique
1661000	1662000	From
1662000	1663000	You know
1663000	1664000	The whole
1664000	1665000	The story wasn't a rip off
1665000	1666000	Of Friday the 13th
1666000	1667000	Right it talks about
1667000	1668000	Splatterhouse has an ancient
1668000	1670000	Mayan mask that is
1670000	1673000	Strapped onto its corpse or whatever
1673000	1674000	Yeah
1674000	1676000	And he has to go save his girlfriend
1676000	1677000	So
1677000	1678000	Interesting
1678000	1679000	He's probably already dead
1679000	1680000	I wonder if it'll be like
1680000	1681000	A first person game
1681000	1682000	Probably not
1682000	1683000	Because they have the title character
1683000	1684000	Right here
1684000	1685000	But
1685000	1686000	No it's probably gonna be
1686000	1687000	Another platformer
1687000	1688000	Well we'll see what happens
1688000	1689000	More details
1689000	1690000	Butcher it
1690000	1691000	Butcher characters in the game
1691000	1693000	But don't butcher the game itself
1693000	1694000	We'll see
1694000	1695000	Speaking of butchered
1695000	1698000	Not really
1698000	1701000	For our buddies over in Europe
1701000	1702000	They've got a date for a
1702000	1703000	Super Smash Brothers Brawl
1703000	1705000	And it's going to be
1705000	1707000	June 27th
1707000	1709000	Also in addition to that
1709000	1712000	WiiWare will be out on May 20th
1712000	1713000	So
1713000	1715000	Put it in your diary
1715000	1717000	It's coming
1717000	1718000	Put it in your diary
1718000	1719000	That's what they call it there
1719000	1720000	So I'm calling it
1720000	1721000	Oh I see
1721000	1722000	Oh
1722000	1724000	I get the image of like you know
1724000	1725000	A little 12 year old girl
1725000	1726000	Who keeps her diary under her pillow
1726000	1727000	With a little hello kitty key
1727000	1728000	That opens it
1728000	1729000	We call them planners
1729000	1731000	Dear Diary
1731000	1732000	We call them planners
1732000	1733000	Oh okay
1733000	1734000	Yes Dear Diary
1734000	1736000	Today I pwn some noobs on Smash Brothers
1736000	1738000	I beat the shit out of them with
1738000	1741000	Princess Peach
1741000	1742000	I want a pony
1742000	1744000	The end
1744000	1745000	Dear Diary
1745000	1747000	Today I played Strip Clue
1747000	1749000	It was Miss Scarlet in the billiard room
1749000	1750000	With my
1750000	1752000	Never mind
1752000	1753000	Let's move on
1753000	1754000	More stories please
1754000	1756000	I don't know if they would consider that
1756000	1757000	Concealed weapon
1757000	1759000	But it was concealed
1759000	1761000	Let's see here
1761000	1763000	So there's a company called Shadowbane
1763000	1765000	What is wrong with this show?
1765000	1767000	That's working with
1767000	1769000	Nintendo to make an MMO
1769000	1770000	And the question is
1770000	1772000	They didn't really say what the MMO was
1772000	1774000	They were just calling it a
1774000	1776000	As yet unnamed
1776000	1777000	MMO project
1777000	1779000	But people are starting to think
1779000	1781000	Hmm
1781000	1783000	Perhaps are they developing
1783000	1785000	Animal Crossing for the Wii?
1785000	1787000	Or is it just going to be another MMO that
1787000	1788000	You know
1788000	1790000	Just wait until E3
1790000	1792000	I mean enough with the speculation
1792000	1793000	You know what I mean?
1793000	1795000	You're not going to find out any more details until E3
1795000	1796000	Obviously
1796000	1798000	Nintendo runs a very tight run ship
1798000	1800000	Where everybody's mouths are sealed
1800000	1801000	And they can't say anything about it
1801000	1802000	You know no matter who's developing it
1802000	1804000	So just wait
1804000	1806000	I think it's inevitable the game is coming eventually
1806000	1808000	But I think it would be kind of funny if
1808000	1810000	Nintendo surprised us and didn't announce the game at E3
1810000	1812000	But kind of came out of left field with something completely different
1812000	1813000	And which
1813000	1814000	No think about it
1814000	1816000	Would you really want an MMO for
1816000	1817000	Animal Crossing?
1817000	1819000	Yeah who's to say it's not a completely new IP?
1819000	1821000	You never know
1821000	1822000	Mario brother
1822000	1824000	Oh Super Mario RPG
1824000	1826000	Or Super Mario MMO RPG
1826000	1828000	I don't know about that
1828000	1830000	I don't know how you'd make that work but
1830000	1832000	Everyone's like plumber class
1832000	1834000	Or princess class
1834000	1836000	Princess class you know I'd have to play that
1836000	1838000	Or Toadstool class
1838000	1840000	I don't know
1840000	1842000	Huh maybe you're onto something
1842000	1844000	Who knows maybe you could do something like that
1844000	1848000	Copyright patentpending.com
1848000	1850000	P.S. money
1850000	1854000	Well I'm sure when the game is to be debuted
1854000	1856000	Whatever it is the secret project they're working on
1856000	1858000	One of the places that you're going to be able to see the
1858000	1861000	Clips and trailers of it first is the Everyone's Nintendo channel
1861000	1864000	You know that it had come out over in Japan
1864000	1866000	It is coming out in the US
1866000	1869000	It is confirmed this new channel is going to come out in the US
1869000	1872000	But it's just being called simply the Nintendo channel
1872000	1874000	It will come out at some point within the next month
1874000	1876000	It's coming out around the same time as WiiWare
1876000	1878000	Don't know yet if it's going to be the same day
1878000	1880000	Or if it's kind of like around that period
1880000	1882000	Here's the other interesting thing
1882000	1884000	If you play a WiiWare title
1884000	1886000	For at least an hour
1886000	1888000	And it has to be something that you actually purchased
1888000	1890000	From the channel it can't be a demo or anything like that
1890000	1892000	You will get to review the game
1892000	1895000	And I guess your reviews are posted on the Nintendo channels
1895000	1896000	But you have to
1896000	1898000	I think that's interesting that they make you play it for an hour
1898000	1899000	Before you can review it
1899000	1901000	But that's obviously a good thing
1901000	1903000	So you don't get a lot of crap in there
1903000	1905000	You know what I mean from people just hyped about the game
1905000	1907000	This game made my pants hurt!
1907000	1908000	Exactly
1908000	1910000	And anyone can read those reviews
1910000	1912000	Of course this channel is going to be free
1912000	1915000	And pretty much all the features that you've come to expect
1915000	1918000	From the Japanese version will show up in this version as well
1918000	1920000	So it's just a matter of when this is going to show up
1920000	1922000	But sometime in the next month
1922000	1925000	So that'll be pretty cool
1925000	1927000	Sooner rather than later right?
1927000	1928000	Now everyone's a critic
1928000	1930000	Nintendo's encouraging it
1930000	1932000	Well there's something else that
1932000	1935000	Nintendo themselves is going to be criticized for
1935000	1936000	What's that?
1936000	1940000	Well there was a discussion going on with Iwata
1940000	1943000	That was after they've gone through all their
1943000	1945000	You know I guess financial meeting
1945000	1947000	That they go through
1947000	1949000	Like any big company has
1949000	1952000	And he's quoted as saying that their
1952000	1954000	Projection for the year
1954000	1956000	Is not based on hardware cuts
1956000	1958000	And they are not going to need them
1958000	1961000	So translated from corporate to real English
1961000	1963000	That means
1963000	1965000	We're still making money so
1965000	1967000	Forget it we're not going to lower prices
1967000	1970000	I wouldn't think that they would lower prices anyways
1970000	1973000	They're having problems keeping enough stock
1973000	1975000	You know for this
1975000	1978000	Hardware for portables and consoles
1978000	1981000	I mean the demand's not going down for any of them
1981000	1983000	So there's no reason to lower the prices
1983000	1984000	That'd be stupid
1984000	1986000	Oh we're sold out of it people just want to buy it
1986000	1987000	They'll buy it for $700
1987000	1989000	Let's drop it to $99
1989000	1990000	Cause we don't like money
1990000	1992000	Well there's more
1992000	1995000	So far they've sold 25 million Wii
1995000	2000000	And they've sold 70 million DS's
2000000	2005000	The sales are up 73% for the financial year
2005000	2009000	With 47.7% profit
2009000	2011000	So that's not bad at all
2011000	2013000	And there's some other news that came out
2013000	2015000	They're upping their allocations
2015000	2017000	Of what they're going to be making each month
2017000	2019000	For the Wii
2019000	2021000	From 1.6 million units
2021000	2024000	Being manufactured to 2.4 million
2024000	2026000	So hopefully that will ease
2026000	2028000	You know the retailers paying out there
2028000	2031000	But I don't think it's enough
2031000	2033000	But they will conquer the world soon
2033000	2035000	Soon
2035000	2037000	Another franchise is hoping
2037000	2039000	Wait real curious before we hop on to the next story
2039000	2041000	One thing I was kind of curious about is
2041000	2042000	What about you know
2042000	2044000	We knew a couple years ago that inevitably
2044000	2046000	The Wii's were going to come out in all these different colors
2046000	2048000	Cause remember we saw the little you know prototypes
2048000	2050000	For the you know the pink Wii and the blue Wii
2050000	2051000	And what have you
2051000	2053000	Even though you know they're not going to lower the price of the Wii
2053000	2055000	Are they ever going to come out with these different modifications
2055000	2057000	Or is that something else they want to pull
2057000	2058000	Wait to pull out of the hat
2058000	2059000	I think they're going to
2059000	2060000	That's something that you want to bring out
2060000	2062000	When the demand starts to drop
2062000	2063000	Because people are like
2063000	2065000	You know it gives them another reason to buy the console
2065000	2067000	I don't think that right now
2067000	2069000	Until the demand starts dipping down a little bit
2069000	2071000	Until they start you know flattening out the demand
2071000	2073000	Versus what they've got in stock
2073000	2075000	I don't think you're going to see any of these new colors
2075000	2076000	Or price drops
2076000	2078000	Or any sort of like bundles or whatever
2078000	2079000	Cause they don't
2079000	2081000	They don't need to entice people to buy them
2081000	2084000	Cause people are already clamoring to buy these things
2084000	2086000	So
2086000	2088000	Yeah it'll be a while
2090000	2094000	Well one franchise that's making a return pretty soon
2094000	2096000	Which is pretty cool actually
2096000	2097000	Is Earthworm Jim
2097000	2099000	They're actually relaunching the franchise
2099000	2101000	They're going to be doing a brand new cartoon series
2101000	2103000	As well as some new video games
2103000	2105000	That are going to be coming to
2106000	2108000	Platforms all over the place
2108000	2109000	Including hopefully
2109000	2111000	PlayStation 2, 3
2111000	2113000	And Xbox 360 and Wii
2113000	2117000	And no word yet on
2117000	2119000	You know when this is all going to happen
2119000	2121000	But
2121000	2122000	Hopefully very soon
2122000	2125000	So we'll see some more of Earthworm Jim
2125000	2127000	Probably this year maybe
2128000	2129000	Hmm
2129000	2131000	Why do you think all of a sudden they want to bring
2131000	2132000	Bring back this one
2132000	2133000	I mean
2133000	2134000	I don't know
2134000	2136000	Why bring back Bionic Commando
2136000	2137000	Or Splatterhouse I guess huh
2137000	2139000	I guess retro is all the rage
2139000	2141000	So why not bring back Earthworm Jim
2141000	2143000	I know that game always used to crack me up
2143000	2144000	Simply for the fact that when you turned it on
2144000	2145000	Like remember the title screen
2145000	2148000	It was somebody burping the name Earthworm Jim
2149000	2150000	And it wasn't a bad game either
2150000	2152000	It was kind of cute for a Super Nintendo game
2152000	2154000	That's the system I had it on was Super Nintendo
2155000	2158000	Was that one of the games that Tommy Tallarico scored
2158000	2160000	Two of the games he's kind of famous for
2161000	2162000	Good times
2163000	2166000	Well if you have never heard of Earthworm Jim
2166000	2167000	And you've never played it
2167000	2169000	Guess what you're going to have the chance
2169000	2171000	The game is coming to the Virtual Console
2171000	2174000	Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2
2174000	2176000	Are going to be somewhat soon
2176000	2178000	There's no date yet
2178000	2180000	Going to be coming to the download service
2180000	2182000	But it's the Sega Genesis version of the game
2182000	2184000	Not the Super Nintendo version I grew up on
2184000	2186000	But the Sega Genesis version of the game
2186000	2188000	Which you know close enough
2188000	2190000	Is going to be coming to the Virtual Console
2190000	2191000	By the way just FYI
2191000	2193000	Clay Fighter and Boogerman
2193000	2195000	Are also on their way out
2195000	2197000	Both also the Genesis versions of the games
2197000	2199000	Clay Fighter is fucking awesome
2199000	2201000	Clay Fighter is pretty rad
2201000	2202000	Although it's one of those games
2202000	2204000	I don't know for me like you play it for an hour
2204000	2205000	And then the joke's old
2205000	2206000	You know what I mean
2206000	2208000	It's all about Helga with her opera attack
2208000	2209000	What about Frosty
2209000	2211000	Bad Mr. Frosty
2211000	2213000	I used to always play as the blob
2214000	2215000	That was my favorite
2215000	2216000	Awesome
2217000	2218000	Bad Mr. Frosty was great
2218000	2221000	Rama says the Genesis version has an extra level doesn't it
2221000	2222000	Not sure
2223000	2224000	Not sure
2224000	2226000	Well all those games are on their way out
2226000	2228000	So soon we don't have a date
2228000	2230000	But usually when these games are announced
2230000	2232000	There's less than a month to go
2232000	2233000	So there you go
2233000	2235000	Act Deft in Chat real quick says
2235000	2238000	Tigerclaw Tommy Tallarico is working on the new Earthworm gym
2238000	2239000	Or so I heard
2239000	2240000	Rumor alert
2240000	2241000	Rumor alert
2241000	2242000	Who are you
2243000	2244000	Well
2244000	2247000	You know especially for those of us who are
2247000	2250000	Artists who probably found this really hilarious
2250000	2252000	But you know the deal with
2252000	2255000	The Okami we cover with the IGN watermark
2255000	2258000	Oh yes the hilarity that ensued last week yes
2258000	2259000	Which is really funny because
2259000	2262000	I don't see why they bother watermarking it in the first place
2262000	2264000	When it's actually Capcom's art
2264000	2265000	So it's sort of like
2265000	2267000	Oh we're gonna put our name on it
2267000	2268000	It's ours now
2269000	2270000	No
2270000	2271000	Anyway
2271000	2276000	Because of this clusterfuck of craptitude
2277000	2280000	Capcom has released two new covers
2280000	2283000	That you can go on their website and
2283000	2284000	What
2284000	2288000	No I'm laughing because I think this is just a stupid idea sorry
2288000	2291000	I just want the covers to begin with because they're pretty
2291000	2293000	But if you go to capcom.com
2293000	2296000	Slash art redemption all one word
2296000	2300000	You can pick one of two covers
2300000	2304000	You can actually either get the original or two
2304000	2308000	Special versions that they have
2308000	2312000	One of them is a completely painted
2312000	2315000	Green background with the wolf
2315000	2318000	And a neat looking other side on the back
2318000	2321000	And the other which I personally like
2321000	2325000	It looks like some level artwork with the wolf superimposed in the front
2325000	2326000	You know where the front cover would be
2326000	2328000	And cherry blossoms
2328000	2330000	And I like that one better myself
2330000	2333000	I can't stop laughing because the site was called what
2333000	2334000	Art redemption
2334000	2335000	Redemption
2335000	2336000	Redemption for who
2336000	2340000	And I'm wondering if you don't actually have the game
2340000	2342000	If you can just get one
2342000	2345000	You never know it might make a cute little mini poster
2345000	2346000	You can
2346000	2347000	That's kinda cool
2347000	2349000	Oh I think you can
2349000	2352000	But I mean it's just funny I think the thing is silly
2352000	2354000	Because honestly how many people are gonna do that
2354000	2355000	When there's the more hilarity of
2355000	2356000	I'm doing it right now
2356000	2361000	OMG I have the uber rare watermark cover
2361000	2362000	I don't know
2362000	2364000	Or even better you just get one of those and you're like
2364000	2367000	Oh hey look there's a game spot watermark on there now
2367000	2369000	You never know
2369000	2371000	But hey free game covers
2371000	2374000	And Jamie's ordering one right now even though she doesn't have the game
2374000	2378000	Oh VS Jason SV says they don't ask for a serial number
2378000	2379000	So yes you can do it
2379000	2381000	They don't and I'm ordering one right now
2381000	2382000	Nice
2382000	2384000	Can you order two? Can you get one for the studio?
2384000	2385000	No let's you pick one
2385000	2386000	I'll have to go order one too
2386000	2387000	I'm getting the pretty one
2387000	2388000	Alright
2388000	2389000	The one with the cherry blossoms
2389000	2390000	I'll get the ugly one then for the studio
2390000	2392000	But I'm gonna let my friend know who really loves this game too
2392000	2394000	Very cool
2394000	2399000	So there's some pretty cool mods that are out there right now for Unreal Tournament 3
2399000	2402000	Although this one seems to kind of take the cake right now
2402000	2404000	Super Mario Brothers
2404000	2407000	They made a Super Mario Brothers Unreal Tournament 3 mod
2407000	2412000	And what it is basically is it's kind of like a 2D version of Unreal Tournament
2412000	2415000	But with like Super Mario Brother themed levels
2415000	2418000	So you can run around kind of like I don't know
2418000	2420000	Super Smash Unreal Tournament
2420000	2421000	Or something like that
2421000	2427000	But it is available to download off of the Epic Mega Games forums
2427000	2430000	So check out epicgames.com
2430000	2432000	Check their forums and you'll find a link to
2432000	2436000	UT2D Super Mario Beta
2436000	2439000	For the PC and Playstation 3
2439000	2440000	So that's kind of cool
2440000	2443000	I hope more games support mods and we see more things like this
2443000	2446000	So and these are things I can download on the Playstation 3?
2446000	2447000	Yeah
2447000	2448000	That's kind of neat
2448000	2452000	So what are the PC mods for Unreal Tournament 3 for the Playstation 3?
2452000	2454000	There's a great niche for the Playstation 3 right there
2454000	2458000	I kind of hope they explore more things like that with the customizations and more games
2458000	2459000	Yeah
2459000	2461000	You know I know we talked about that when this whole game first came out
2461000	2464000	But to actually see kind of the you know
2464000	2466000	Metamorphosis of that is pretty cool
2466000	2468000	And this is only scratching the surface
2468000	2471000	I mean think of all the games out there
2471000	2474000	Like using the Unreal Engine that they did total conversions for
2474000	2477000	Made a completely different game out of the whole thing
2477000	2479000	I mean you're going to see some of these come out
2479000	2482000	And then you're going to actually be able to play these on your Playstation 3
2482000	2485000	So Unreal Tournament will essentially become like
2485000	2486000	All these different games
2486000	2490000	Which is pretty awesome and definitely worth replay value
2490000	2491000	So
2491000	2492000	Hmm
2492000	2493000	Very cool
2493000	2497000	DJ Genai said I played that over at my friend's house
2497000	2498000	Good God
2500000	2502000	Alright let's do one more story here
2502000	2504000	And then we're going to get into some release dates
2504000	2508000	But this could affect a lot of different releases coming out soon
2508000	2512000	The Wii end user license agreement was recently updated
2512000	2514000	You know all that legal blah blah blah
2514000	2516000	That usually you don't even read and you just bother to click accept
2516000	2518000	You know just kind of go through it
2518000	2520000	I don't know Jamie do you read every word
2520000	2522000	On those end user license agreements
2522000	2523000	Huh
2523000	2525000	You know those things you have to click accept too
2525000	2526000	All the legal blah blah blah
2526000	2527000	I know what you mean and my reply was huh
2527000	2528000	Yeah exactly
2528000	2529000	Alright
2529000	2531000	Well the Wii just recently updated theirs
2531000	2533000	And the interesting thing about it
2533000	2535000	I mean I could read this whole thing but
2535000	2537000	You know basically the part you want to know is
2537000	2539000	Is that the Wii console and the Wii network service
2539000	2542000	Are not designed for use with any unauthorized device
2542000	2545000	Or any non-license accessory
2545000	2548000	You may not use any such device in connection with your Wii console
2548000	2549000	Or Wii network service
2549000	2552000	If you do it it's illegal avoids the warranty blah blah blah
2552000	2555000	So it's interesting that they updated this to specifically target
2555000	2557000	Unlicensed accessories
2557000	2560000	Do you think that has to do with the recent surgeons
2560000	2563000	Of all these fake Mario Kart wheel things we've seen
2563000	2565000	I don't think it has anything to do with that
2565000	2568000	I think if anything it has something to do with the Wii freeloader
2568000	2570000	Okay because I was going to say
2570000	2572000	I mean I think accessories
2572000	2574000	Peripherals it doesn't matter
2574000	2576000	Wacko tapes their Wii controller too
2576000	2577000	Exactly it's not going to hurt nothing
2577000	2579000	I see so things like the freeloader
2579000	2580000	They're trying to go after
2580000	2581000	Well that makes more sense
2581000	2583000	Hmm
2583000	2585000	I wonder if there's other types of like
2585000	2588000	Controllers out there that help you cheat at games or something
2588000	2589000	I don't know
2589000	2591000	Well not in the Wii
2591000	2593000	On the 360 they've got
2593000	2595000	Like I was telling you before the show
2595000	2597000	There's those head in the game controllers
2597000	2599000	Where they've made custom modifications
2599000	2601000	That add buttons to the bottom
2601000	2603000	They're remapping buttons and stuff like that
2603000	2606000	I need an NES advantage update
2606000	2609000	Let my NES advantage work with the Wii?
2609000	2610000	You know what
2610000	2612000	They should come out with an NES advantage controller
2612000	2614000	You know what I mean there were the official items
2614000	2616000	That had turbo buttons and crap
2616000	2619000	And even NEC got it right
2619000	2622000	With the turbo graphics and PC engine
2622000	2625000	That it had a turbo switch on there
2625000	2627000	That you could put it up to three
2627000	2631000	So I don't see what the big deal is
2631000	2633000	With cheats or anything
2633000	2635000	Remember on the NES advantage
2635000	2636000	I think it was that one
2636000	2637000	They had a slow button too
2637000	2639000	That was just the start button being hit really quick
2639000	2640000	You know what was great about that?
2640000	2641000	What?
2641000	2643000	Shooting games
2643000	2645000	Like a life force
2645000	2647000	Unless every time you hit pause
2647000	2649000	It goes doo doo doo doo doo
2649000	2650000	And then pauses or whatever
2650000	2651000	And then so if you get that
2651000	2652000	Like it doesn't work
2652000	2653000	It's horrible
2653000	2655000	You just hear that noise over and over
2655000	2657000	It worked great on like ice hockey though
2657000	2658000	That's what I remember
2658000	2660000	I still have an NES advantage out here somewhere
2660000	2662000	I know we used them in one of our photo shoots
2662000	2663000	That we did
2663000	2664000	I have one
2664000	2665000	It was fun
2665000	2666000	I also have a robot
2666000	2667000	Rob the robot
2667000	2669000	Alright well let's get to some release dates
2669000	2671000	Let's start over in the UK, shall we?
2671000	2673000	Okay
2673000	2675000	Stuff is coming out
2675000	2676000	Really only two games
2676000	2679000	On the 29th they get Grand Theft Auto 4
2679000	2680000	Yippie
2680000	2682000	And on the 2nd of May
2682000	2683000	Dream Pinball
2683000	2686000	Which I'm actually more excited about than Grand Theft Auto 4
2686000	2688000	And just a few other things
2688000	2690000	That are going to be coming out in the month of
2690000	2692000	That's pretty good is the
2692000	2693000	Pool Party
2693000	2694000	No I'm kidding
2694000	2696000	It's been listed rock band
2696000	2698000	Heading out, Death Junior
2698000	2700000	The Iron Man game
2700000	2702000	And Apollo Justice
2702000	2704000	So you have that to look forward to coming up in May
2706000	2707000	For the US
2707000	2712000	We're getting Baseball Mogul 2009 on the PC
2712000	2714000	Toy Shop on the DS
2714000	2717000	Let's Yoga on the DS
2717000	2720000	Let's Pilates on the DS
2720000	2721000	Let's not
2721000	2723000	Let's Pilates on the DS
2723000	2726000	Brain Voyage on the DS
2726000	2729000	Great Wars Nations
2729000	2731000	The Spartans on PC
2731000	2732000	And then let's see
2732000	2735000	SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1
2735000	2738000	On PSP and PlayStation 2
2738000	2742000	Then we've got Iron Man coming out on Friday
2742000	2746000	On PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
2746000	2749000	Wii, PSP, and DS
2749000	2751000	And then a couple smaller games here
2751000	2753000	Today we had Mario Kart Wii
2753000	2755000	And on Tuesday
2755000	2757000	We have Grand Theft Auto 4
2757000	2760000	But I'm sure no one's really going to be paying attention to that
2760000	2762000	And that's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360
2762000	2764000	But what the hell is Grand Theft Auto 4?
2764000	2766000	Seriously, I haven't heard of that game ever
2766000	2767000	Never heard of it
2767000	2770000	Grand Theft Auto 4 is also coming out in Asia
2770000	2771000	That's a general release
2771000	2773000	I usually do Japanese release dates
2773000	2775000	But also some general Asia release dates
2775000	2777000	That are a much broader region
2777000	2781000	However, I am most confident that it's not any type of localized version
2781000	2785000	It's pretty much just a version of the game
2785000	2788000	From the same one the US and the rest of the world is getting
2788000	2792000	I don't know if Japan is scheduled to get a translated version of the game
2792000	2795000	They got one for the other Grand Theft Auto games, didn't they?
2795000	2796000	I think so
2796000	2797000	Maybe in the future
2797000	2798000	But they got them way late
2798000	2800000	Yeah, they got them way later
2800000	2805000	Just like, hey, same reason we have to wait forever for JRPGs to come out over here
2805000	2807000	Same kind of logic, just in reverse
2807000	2811000	So honestly, there is not a whole lot coming out
2811000	2813000	Because of the whole Grand Theft Auto thing
2813000	2815000	Even though it's not coming out in Japan
2815000	2816000	I don't get that
2816000	2820000	But there is, on the Nintendo Wii coming out in Japan
2820000	2823000	ProYaku Family Stadium is coming out
2823000	2824000	That's baseball
2824000	2826000	This is interesting
2826000	2827000	Link's crossbow training
2827000	2830000	I didn't realize we got it way before Japan
2830000	2832000	But it is just now making its way to Japan on May 1st
2832000	2834000	The Wii Zapper and Link's crossbow training
2834000	2835000	Yeah, they aren't missing much
2835000	2839000	Whenever you see the ProYaku, that's baseball
2839000	2841000	Baseball, well, who doesn't love...
2841000	2843000	Excuse me
2843000	2844000	Excuse me, ah
2844000	2845000	I'm dying
2845000	2846000	I get stuff
2846000	2848000	Live radio, Jesus
2848000	2850000	Nintendo DS, May 1st
2850000	2852000	A bunch of stuff comes out
2852000	2854000	Most of it is just peripherals
2854000	2856000	For instance, you can get a new shiny pouch
2856000	2857000	And a touch pen
2857000	2858000	In all these different colors
2858000	2860000	However, there are some games coming out as well
2860000	2862000	Emblem of Gundam is coming out
2862000	2866000	Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Fate of Heat
2866000	2868000	Comes out on the Nintendo DS as well
2868000	2872000	As Anpanman to Asobo ABC Kyoshitsu
2872000	2874000	Anpanman
2874000	2876000	Anpanman is great
2876000	2877000	He looks like bread
2877000	2879000	Well, he gets his own DS game very soon
2879000	2881000	And on the Sony PSP
2881000	2884000	Nippon no Asoko-de
2884000	2886000	I don't know if that's some type of like
2886000	2887000	Japanese traveler game
2887000	2889000	It's coming out from Sony themselves
2889000	2890000	What?
2890000	2891000	It means...
2891000	2892000	What?
2892000	2893000	Well, Nippon's Japan
2893000	2895000	No Asoko-de
2895000	2898000	Yeah, that sounds like it would be traveling
2898000	2899000	Because it means go over there
2899000	2900000	Yeah, it looks like it's like a
2900000	2901000	It shows you
2901000	2902000	I don't know, it looks like SimCity
2902000	2904000	But it actually is showing you
2904000	2906000	Actual parts of Japan
2906000	2907000	That's weird
2907000	2908000	This one screenshot I'm looking at
2908000	2910000	Has like all these like power structures
2910000	2911000	And things
2911000	2913000	So I don't know if there's a game in here
2913000	2914000	But it definitely looks like it's using
2914000	2915000	Real roads and things
2915000	2916000	So
2916000	2918000	It looks like it could be interesting
2918000	2919000	Rob
2919000	2920000	But probably not for us
2920000	2921000	That's probably not something you want to import
2921000	2923000	I'm gonna show you what Anpanman looks like
2923000	2924000	Alright, you do that
2924000	2925000	Post me a link in chat or something
2925000	2926000	Oh
2926000	2928000	Oh, that's cute
2928000	2930000	I'm gonna link it in the chatroom
2930000	2932000	Because Anpanman's adorable
2932000	2933000	Enough cuteness, more gaming news
2933000	2935000	I want Anpanman
2935000	2937000	I wonder if they have any
2937000	2938000	Actually, Warrior Bob
2938000	2940000	Was over in Japan
2940000	2941000	Recently
2941000	2942000	And he like IMed me
2942000	2945000	So I told him I wanted an Anpanman plushie
2945000	2946000	Really?
2946000	2947000	Yeah
2947000	2948000	He asked what
2948000	2950000	Cotton game it was I was looking for
2950000	2951000	Oh
2951000	2952000	It's really cool
2952000	2954000	I thought it was very nice of him to
2954000	2956000	Make him come back on the show at some point
2956000	2959000	Well, speaking of the show
2959000	2961000	Which I should be paying more attention to
2961000	2963000	Instead of Anpanman
2963000	2965000	There's details released about
2965000	2967000	Bionic Commando's multiplayer
2967000	2970000	For anyone who is interested
2970000	2972000	Now that is
2972000	2973000	Excuse me
2973000	2974000	Only gonna be for
2974000	2975000	For a
2975000	2977000	Offline play
2977000	2979000	For Bionic Commando re-armed
2979000	2981000	But there will be
2981000	2984000	It will be presented in a zoomed out
2984000	2986000	2D sort of mode
2986000	2987000	You know
2987000	2989000	Sort of I guess like the
2989000	2991000	Playing, you know, a lot of people in
2991000	2993000	Smash Brothers is done I guess
2993000	2996000	You have Deathmatch, Last Man Standing
2996000	2999000	But
2999000	3001000	They say the defining
3001000	3003000	Object is gonna be your Bionic Arms
3003000	3005000	You'll have
3005000	3007000	You'll be able to block projectiles
3007000	3009000	Grab power-ups
3009000	3012000	You'll have
3012000	3015000	You'll have that as your only weapon
3015000	3018000	And
3018000	3021000	And then
3021000	3023000	They're also saying
3023000	3025000	Is that they've
3025000	3027000	Made this 150 megabytes
3027000	3029000	Also for this size
3029000	3031000	So
3031000	3033000	It's gonna have some stuff
3033000	3035000	It will be Live Arcade
3035000	3037000	PlayStation Network
3037000	3039000	And PC in May
3039000	3041000	Oh yeah and there's one other mode
3041000	3044000	That you have to go around without touching the floor
3044000	3047000	Hmm
3047000	3050000	I'm kind of excited to check out the new Bionic Commando game
3050000	3052000	It's gonna be good times
3052000	3054000	I should call that mode where you don't touch the floor like
3054000	3055000	Hot Lava mode
3055000	3057000	Remember playing Hot Lava in like
3057000	3059000	Kindergarten or like
3059000	3060000	Elementary school?
3060000	3061000	No
3061000	3062000	The hell's this?
3062000	3064000	It's basically you play on like playground equipment
3064000	3065000	And the ground is lava
3065000	3066000	You have one
3066000	3067000	It's like tag
3067000	3069000	But one person is like the lava monster or whatever
3069000	3071000	And they have to stay on the ground
3071000	3073000	Where everyone else is up on stuff
3073000	3075000	And you have to try to tag them and stuff
3075000	3077000	Interesting
3077000	3079000	You're really not up on elementary school
3079000	3080000	Recess games
3080000	3082000	You know what after the show let's go play Hot Lava
3082000	3084000	I know an elementary school here
3084000	3086000	Now
3086000	3088000	That would be a funny commercial for our show
3088000	3090000	Well anyways
3090000	3092000	We had better games than that
3092000	3095000	What happens when you take the video games away from the video gamers?
3095000	3097000	We took it a step further
3097000	3099000	When we used to have a game of tag
3099000	3101000	That would involve a hula hoop
3101000	3102000	And we'd throw it at each other
3102000	3104000	Because playing like
3104000	3106000	A game like Hot Lava or whatever
3106000	3108000	With a very large piece of playground equipment
3108000	3110000	You can't obviously reach up like
3110000	3111000	12 feet above you
3111000	3113000	But you can throw a hula hoop at someone's head
3113000	3115000	12 feet above you so
3115000	3116000	That was fun
3116000	3118000	We used to make up this game
3118000	3120000	That we would play because we didn't have recess
3120000	3122000	We just had an extended play period
3122000	3124000	Where we would take the hula hoops
3124000	3126000	And throw them and try to capture people
3126000	3128000	But then we would also try to like
3128000	3130000	Drag them off and tie them to the
3130000	3131000	Tither ball thing
3131000	3133000	It's like a twisted version of Pokemon
3133000	3135000	Okay apparently like everybody
3135000	3137000	Knows Hot Lava in chat
3137000	3139000	You know what I think there was
3139000	3141000	A game we played that was just like that
3141000	3143000	Except it was Sharks
3143000	3145000	I think it was Sharks or something like that
3145000	3147000	Where everything was Sharks
3147000	3149000	I want to say there was a Type A
3149000	3151000	I remember a tag game that you played on playground equipment
3151000	3153000	But it was like Sharks I think
3153000	3155000	Wait real quick I gotta say this
3155000	3157000	You know we all love those playground games
3157000	3159000	From when we were kids
3159000	3161000	I remember smear the queer did you guys play that?
3161000	3163000	No I remember a bunch of us got busted
3163000	3165000	What? A bunch of us got busted for playing that one day
3165000	3167000	It was something you played with the football
3167000	3169000	And you know whoever
3169000	3171000	Like had the football was the queer
3171000	3173000	And he had to run around
3173000	3175000	This is horrible I know
3175000	3177000	You know the way things turned out
3177000	3179000	You know
3179000	3181000	I don't wish to get smeared on a daily basis
3181000	3183000	Anymore but you know that's just
3183000	3185000	I think that's why we got in trouble for playing it
3185000	3187000	We used to play soccer ball
3187000	3189000	We would try to grab that person
3189000	3191000	And grab the ball away from him
3191000	3193000	We would put a tennis ball in a sock
3193000	3195000	And throw it at people
3195000	3197000	I'm not joking
3197000	3199000	That reminds me of that scene
3199000	3201000	In what the hell was that movie
3201000	3203000	By Kubrick the war movie
3203000	3205000	Full Metal Jacket
3205000	3207000	Where they all put the soap in the sock
3207000	3209000	And start beating the guy with it
3209000	3211000	Well the whole point of this is that
3211000	3213000	It's sort of like crazy dodge ball
3213000	3215000	If you get hit with the sock ball
3215000	3217000	Who gets to throw the sock ball
3217000	3219000	It's pretty funny
3219000	3221000	Anyways back on topic
3221000	3223000	I want to say
3223000	3225000	We never are on topic on this show dammit
3225000	3227000	They need to compile a bunch of playground
3227000	3229000	Games into a game
3229000	3231000	I think it's been done before but not very well
3231000	3233000	I want to say they need all these classes
3233000	3235000	But they need it on Xbox Live Arcade
3235000	3237000	And something like
3237000	3239000	Where everybody is competing
3239000	3241000	To be the king of the school yard
3241000	3243000	Who wouldn't play that game
3243000	3245000	I think it would be fun
3245000	3247000	They should actually do a Simon says one
3247000	3249000	That uses some sort of motion sensor
3249000	3251000	Or the wiimote
3251000	3253000	So it can tell where you're holding the wiimote
3253000	3255000	It might be fun
3255000	3257000	That would be great
3257000	3259000	Hold on
3259000	3261000	I gotta get chat comments
3261000	3263000	Rama says the game I was talking about
3263000	3265000	He says Sky that's called a blanket party
3265000	3267000	And now a highly illegal thing to do in the military
3267000	3269000	A blanket party
3269000	3271000	Hey guys let's play beach blanket bingo
3271000	3273000	Wee
3275000	3277000	So Bionic Commando
3277000	3279000	It's not coming to Virtual Console
3279000	3281000	Anytime soon
3281000	3283000	Because Nintendo doesn't want it to
3283000	3285000	And that's of course coming from
3285000	3287000	Capcom's vice president
3287000	3289000	Of strategic planning Christian
3289000	3291000	Svensson
3291000	3293000	Who basically says that it couldn't happen
3293000	3295000	It is up to
3295000	3297000	Nintendo to allow it to happen
3297000	3299000	Apparently
3299000	3301000	The thoughts are maybe they didn't like the fact that
3301000	3303000	Hitler's head explodes in the game
3303000	3305000	Or the fact that I don't know Hitler's
3305000	3307000	In the game at all
3307000	3309000	He's Mr. D
3309000	3311000	We need a fucking new
3311000	3313000	Castle Wolfenstein to come to
3313000	3315000	Xbox Live Arcade
3315000	3317000	And that would be the shit with multiplayer
3317000	3319000	Why don't they just rename him to
3319000	3321000	Smitler
3321000	3323000	I know he has another name
3323000	3325000	He was Master D
3325000	3327000	And Bionic Commando
3327000	3329000	It was Hitler
3329000	3331000	But he looked like Hitler
3331000	3333000	You know how there's some cats that look like Hitler
3333000	3335000	And there's a whole website dedicated to that
3335000	3337000	This guy looked like Hitler
3337000	3339000	Well he was in the Japanese one
3339000	3341000	Anyhow
3341000	3343000	Something that will be coming to the Nintendo Wii
3343000	3345000	If rumors are to be believed
3345000	3347000	Anyway this is a rumor
3347000	3349000	It was a tip that was sent in
3349000	3351000	To go Nintendo that Metroid Prime
3351000	3353000	Is being remade
3353000	3355000	For the Nintendo Wii
3355000	3357000	Metroid Prime 3 was already on the Nintendo Wii
3357000	3359000	But the rumor is that 1 and 2
3359000	3361000	Are being remade with all
3361000	3363000	New controls and they will all be packaged
3363000	3365000	Into one comprehensive
3365000	3367000	Metroid Prime game
3367000	3369000	Like an ultimate box set
3369000	3371000	If you will for the Nintendo Wii
3371000	3373000	Thoughts?
3373000	3375000	Yeah GameCube port getting some stuck on
3375000	3377000	Waggle controls
3377000	3379000	That sounds like the Wii
3379000	3381000	I know it just sounds like a cheap
3381000	3383000	Play for more money
3383000	3385000	That would buy it
3385000	3387000	Metroid Prime 2 the search for more money
3387000	3389000	I was just thinking that
3389000	3391000	I wonder if they would go back and add stuff to Metroid Prime 3
3391000	3393000	To kind of attract people that might already have it
3393000	3395000	Did they do that with Resident Evil 4?
3395000	3397000	How about online?
3397000	3399000	What?
3399000	3401000	Did they do it with Resident Evil 4?
3401000	3403000	Game to the Wii?
3403000	3405000	No they didn't give it online play or anything
3405000	3407000	They didn't add anything to it
3407000	3409000	That's right because they don't add anything to ports
3409000	3411000	You know what would be good Rob?
3411000	3413000	Is Metroid redone in the style of Metroid Prime?
3413000	3415000	No
3415000	3417000	Don't touch Super Metroid
3417000	3419000	No
3419000	3421000	Super Metroid is a god among men
3421000	3423000	I'm saying it not be
3423000	3425000	Of course the same game
3425000	3427000	But I would like to see what some of those levels
3427000	3429000	Will look like from a different perspective
3429000	3431000	Because I want the music
3431000	3433000	And everything
3433000	3435000	The only redeeming thing they could do ever
3435000	3437000	To Super Metroid is they could do it like they're doing
3437000	3439000	With Bionic Commando
3439000	3441000	And basically just
3441000	3443000	HD version of the 2D game
3443000	3445000	Yes please
3445000	3447000	That's one of my dream games
3447000	3449000	Not an official OLR dream game
3449000	3451000	Not an official OLR dream game
3451000	3453000	Because this is not an original concept
3453000	3455000	But I would like to see
3455000	3457000	Super Metroid given the Bionic Commando
3457000	3459000	Rearmed thing and then made like
3459000	3461000	Four times as big a new game
3461000	3463000	That is like four times as big the world
3463000	3465000	It could go from planet to planet
3465000	3467000	They could do that with the Wii
3467000	3469000	If you're pushing just 2D graphics
3469000	3471000	Or whatever you can go pretty
3471000	3473000	Realistic with that stuff
3473000	3475000	I mean just do it like
3475000	3477000	Symphony of the Night or something like that
3477000	3479000	Just 2D, why do you have to do everything 3D
3479000	3481000	Everything does not have to be 3D
3481000	3483000	Rob, we need an OLR Troid
3487000	3489000	Yeah but it's not an original idea
3489000	3491000	Neither was Symphony of the Night
3491000	3493000	Unless
3493000	3495000	Unless they replace Samus with a cat
3495000	3497000	Then it's an original idea
3497000	3499000	A cat with a laser
3499000	3501000	Exactly
3501000	3503000	That would be actually, I'd play it
3503000	3505000	It should have different laser upgrades as you go through
3505000	3507000	Are you suggesting Symphony of the Laser Cat?
3507000	3509000	It wouldn't be a Symphony
3509000	3511000	It'd be more like
3511000	3513000	Orchestra of the Laser Cat?
3513000	3515000	No, cats yowl
3515000	3517000	It'd be, it wouldn't be
3517000	3519000	Operetta of the Laser Cat?
3519000	3521000	It would be
3521000	3523000	Laser Cat Operetta
3523000	3525000	Okay, it would be
3525000	3527000	Screeching matchable laser cats
3529000	3531000	Chorus, that's it, chorus
3531000	3533000	Some comments from chat
3533000	3535000	Sephiroth1215 says
3535000	3537000	Metroid Prime 1 felt a lot like Super Metroid
3537000	3539000	Okay, I disagree with that comment 100%
3539000	3541000	Because like, when I played Metroid Prime 1
3541000	3543000	For the first time
3543000	3545000	I seriously, I was like, what the fuck did they do to Metroid
3545000	3547000	And I threw the controller, like I did not like
3547000	3549000	Metroid Prime at all when I first played it
3549000	3551000	Now granted, I own Metroid Prime 3 now and it's grown
3551000	3553000	On me, the series, but like, I was so
3553000	3555000	Mad that they raped Metroid by making it a
3555000	3557000	First player game, because I was not so
3557000	3559000	Warm and friendly on the whole first person
3559000	3561000	Conversion, but when I really stepped away
3561000	3563000	And just kind of looked at it as a new series, a new game
3563000	3565000	I was more comfortable with it
3565000	3567000	But I agree, they need to bring back 2D Metroids
3567000	3569000	So J-Rod says
3569000	3571000	They need to go remake and import Eternal
3571000	3573000	Darkness, nevermind this Metroid
3573000	3575000	Nonsense, to which Sairan
3575000	3577000	Follows up with, somebody take over
3577000	3579000	Eternal Darkness is a good idea and give more games
3579000	3581000	Insanity gauges
3581000	3583000	You know, well you remember what game
3583000	3585000	It was that I really liked at E3 a few years ago
3585000	3587000	Was that Call of Cthulhu game
3587000	3589000	Where you're, what you
3589000	3591000	Used to heal yourself was morphine
3591000	3593000	And it could actually end up
3593000	3595000	Killing you anyway
3595000	3597000	Because you would end up addicted to morphine
3597000	3599000	And then you actually couldn't
3599000	3601000	Do part of the game unless you let yourself go crazy
3601000	3603000	Drug abuse the game
3603000	3605000	Nice
3605000	3607000	Some more stuff, how's that
3607000	3609000	Anyhow, so the Metroid Prime trilogy
3609000	3611000	May be on its way to Wii
3611000	3613000	But we would rather Nintendo
3613000	3615000	Just put the resources into giving us a new 2D Metroid
3615000	3617000	Of Uberness on the Wii, but we'll see
3617000	3619000	Well I'm very mad at Nintendo right now
3619000	3621000	Pissed off
3621000	3623000	Not up to F you pissed offness
3623000	3625000	But Club Nintendo
3625000	3627000	This elusive thing
3627000	3629000	This, you know
3629000	3631000	Wonderful
3631000	3633000	Organization is
3633000	3635000	Out in
3635000	3637000	Australia, not in America
3637000	3639000	For everyone
3639000	3641000	Who got their copy
3641000	3643000	Of
3643000	3645000	What game was it
3645000	3647000	It was for
3647000	3649000	Mario Kart
3649000	3651000	There was an invitation
3651000	3653000	In there with a code on it
3653000	3655000	That you could use
3655000	3657000	To use that code and get
3657000	3659000	Nintendo star points
3659000	3661000	The site is not active yet
3661000	3663000	But you can
3663000	3665000	Get started on your
3665000	3667000	Saving up I guess
3667000	3669000	Hmm
3669000	3671000	Alright
3671000	3673000	Give it Nintendo
3673000	3675000	Nintendo just needs to give it to us in America already
3675000	3677000	Stop being hoarse
3679000	3681000	I don't really know a nicer way to say it
3681000	3683000	Stop being hoarse, that's awesome
3683000	3685000	So
3685000	3687000	Earlier this week
3687000	3689000	It's not surprising because
3689000	3691000	With a big game like Grand Theft Auto 4
3691000	3693000	Obviously people are
3693000	3695000	Going to get early and leak it to the internet
3695000	3697000	As they did, but to commemorate
3697000	3699000	Such leakage
3699000	3701000	The notorious
3701000	3703000	BitTorrent site, the Pirate Bay
3703000	3705000	Is now calling themselves
3705000	3707000	Liberty Bay with you know
3707000	3709000	Niko Bellic
3709000	3711000	Of Grand Theft Auto 4
3711000	3713000	On the front page there
3713000	3715000	So that's kind of funny I guess
3715000	3717000	I love Pirate Bay so much
3717000	3719000	Wait a minute, should you be admitting that
3719000	3721000	On this program? Yes, because
3721000	3723000	I'll tell you why I love the Pirate Bay
3723000	3725000	They
3725000	3727000	Because of where their servers are located
3727000	3729000	It's not illegal
3729000	3731000	For them to have
3731000	3733000	And distribute
3733000	3735000	Their content
3735000	3737000	The torrent files Wait a minute, that's where you get your
3737000	3739000	Doctor Who fix isn't it?
3739000	3741000	Hmm
3741000	3743000	Okay, okay
3743000	3745000	Enough said
3745000	3747000	But what's funny is that all of these
3747000	3749000	Different facilities will send them letters
3749000	3751000	Of complaint and you cease and desist
3751000	3753000	And so they publish them on their front page
3753000	3755000	And make fun of them
3755000	3757000	And point out
3757000	3759000	What they're doing is
3759000	3761000	Legal in the country they're operating
3761000	3763000	From
3763000	3765000	And somewhere out there right now
3765000	3767000	Ross Steele UT is throwing something at his radio
3767000	3769000	No one has been able to shut them down
3769000	3771000	Alright
3771000	3773000	Well
3773000	3775000	But just because it's out there doesn't make it right
3775000	3777000	But it makes it awesome
3777000	3779000	And they're hilarious
3779000	3781000	And you know downloading import
3781000	3783000	TV shows is nothing
3783000	3785000	I mean I don't think that should be a big deal
3785000	3787000	Honestly
3787000	3789000	You know, if they've aired and they're gone
3789000	3791000	And you want to get them, why not?
3791000	3793000	Anyhow, especially if they're never going to air over here
3793000	3795000	You know, I think somebody ought to upload
3795000	3797000	A torrent of all this
3797000	3799000	All the old episodes of this
3799000	3801000	Or actually, they don't need to
3801000	3803000	Because all these episodes are online now
3803000	3805000	This show is fucking bad ass
3805000	3807000	I remember this show growing up
3807000	3809000	It was a show, it was hosted by this guy
3809000	3811000	I think his name was Jeff something
3811000	3813000	And he had these, I don't know, it's been a long time
3813000	3815000	Jeff, crap in the head
3815000	3817000	He had these like totally 80's
3817000	3819000	Contestants would come on the show
3819000	3821000	And they would play actual arcade games
3821000	3823000	For prizes
3823000	3825000	Now a lot of you guys remember this show
3825000	3827000	Because it was one of the first shows on G4
3827000	3829000	Back when they were actually about games
3829000	3831000	They used to show reruns of this old show
3831000	3833000	Back when this game was actually on TV
3833000	3835000	I loved watching Starrcade on G4
3835000	3837000	And then they got rid of it
3837000	3839000	It used to be on Fox 40
3839000	3841000	Look, it used to be on Fox 40
3841000	3843000	At like 10am on Saturdays
3843000	3845000	I remember when this game was
3845000	3847000	Or when this show was new
3847000	3849000	But if you want to check this out
3849000	3851000	And look at old episodes of the show
3851000	3853000	Starrcade.tv, they've posted like 15 episodes
3853000	3855000	Of the show if you want to view it
3855000	3857000	And remember the prize
3857000	3859000	Which was the big thing about it
3859000	3861000	Starrcade machine
3861000	3863000	And who didn't want that when they were a kid
3863000	3865000	Dude, I'm going to email these people
3865000	3867000	I'm going to email these people and see if we can get them on the show
3867000	3869000	You know what would be great though
3869000	3871000	Is if they were doing it
3871000	3873000	I know this was before them
3873000	3875000	But giving away the SNK machines
3875000	3877000	With the multi-card
3877000	3879000	Dan and I still want one of those
3879000	3881000	I want to get them on the show
3881000	3883000	Because you know I've got to ask that question
3883000	3885000	Will this show ever come back
3885000	3887000	Will it blend
3887000	3889000	I know, well you don't have the rights to it
3889000	3891000	You'd have to make up a new video game show
3891000	3893000	Whatever, I'd buy the rights to it
3893000	3895000	I mean really, what are they going to do, sit on the rights
3895000	3897000	It'd be called OL Arcade
3897000	3899000	No
3899000	3901000	Patent pending
3901000	3903000	Before we get to the classic game of the week
3903000	3905000	Xenocore in chat wanted to clarify something
3905000	3907000	About the whole like you know I said the import TV shows
3907000	3909000	On torrents
3909000	3911000	Xenocore says, Rob if nobody in the US had
3911000	3913000	Distribution rights for a show, it's not illegal
3913000	3915000	To share it online here, hence why
3915000	3917000	Fan subs of anime are still around
3917000	3919000	Since most fan subs stop their work
3919000	3921000	When the rights are acquired, they are pretty much
3921000	3923000	Left alone, interesting
3923000	3925000	It's done out of respect
3925000	3927000	And if anything, and this also goes back
3927000	3929000	To the argument of music and stuff
3929000	3931000	If anything those fan subs probably drive up
3931000	3933000	Interest in the actual
3933000	3935000	Anime title, then when it comes
3935000	3937000	Over here, it would probably fare a lot better
3937000	3939000	Than say, if it wasn't fan sub
3939000	3941000	Dark Tetsuya and
3941000	3943000	ActDeft in chat almost at the same time
3943000	3945000	Go OL Arcade
3945000	3947000	Instead of Starrcade
3947000	3949000	Well, definitely go
3949000	3951000	Check out some old episodes of that show and
3951000	3953000	Relive the past, because they did some great games
3953000	3955000	On there, good times, especially if
3955000	3957000	You're like under the age of 18
3957000	3959000	So you probably weren't even alive when the show
3959000	3961000	Was first on the air, you gotta go check out
3961000	3963000	Some old episodes, which you were missing
3963000	3965000	There was a time a few years ago that I had actually
3965000	3967000	Seriously considered bringing this back
3967000	3969000	As a part of our station
3969000	3971000	But, a little
3971000	3973000	Different to not get sued
3973000	3975000	There was just that one show and I can't remember
3975000	3977000	What it was
3977000	3979000	But it was, um
3979000	3981000	You'd have like a partner team
3981000	3983000	And they'd go through this trivia business
3983000	3985000	And then they'd get to run through
3985000	3987000	With these velcro jackets
3987000	3989000	Oh, I was just reading about
3989000	3991000	That show on wiki the other day
3991000	3993000	I was just reading about it, somebody in chat will say it
3993000	3995000	It's not Nick Arcade, it's something else
3995000	3997000	This predates Nick Arcade
3997000	3999000	Somebody in chat will say it
3999000	4001000	But I used to watch
4001000	4003000	That show
4003000	4005000	All the freaking time, and I so wanted
4005000	4007000	To be on it
4007000	4009000	Video Power
4009000	4011000	Credit to Rama
4011000	4013000	And there was
4013000	4015000	Also GameProTV
4015000	4017000	Do you know that GameProTV was filmed right here
4017000	4019000	In Sacramento? Was it? Yes
4019000	4021000	I want to
4021000	4023000	I want to say I read something
4023000	4025000	That they used the Sacramento studios
4025000	4027000	That it was actually produced by the folks
4027000	4029000	With the NBC station around here
4029000	4031000	Well, I, um
4031000	4033000	I liked that one because that was
4033000	4035000	The show that
4035000	4037000	First introduced me to a concept
4037000	4039000	That they never really did anything with
4039000	4041000	That I thought was great
4041000	4043000	And I would love to see games actually do this crap
4043000	4045000	And that was the save card for the Neo Geo
4045000	4047000	Where you could play in the arcade
4047000	4049000	Save your data on the card
4049000	4051000	And go play it on your Neo Geo system at home
4051000	4053000	If you had the game
4053000	4055000	You could kind of
4055000	4057000	I mean to do that with like F-Zero
4057000	4059000	Type things, you remember that? Yeah
4059000	4061000	I know, it's a little shady, but
4061000	4063000	But I think that bringing back that sort of
4063000	4065000	Format for a game would encourage people
4065000	4067000	To purchase the
4067000	4069000	Home version too
4069000	4071000	If anything, it would drive sales, I would hope
4071000	4073000	You know what, I'm going to take back what I said earlier
4073000	4075000	By GameProTV, because it says on IMDB
4075000	4077000	They filmed it in Los Angeles, maybe it was just that
4077000	4079000	They did a couple one-off shows, but I want to
4079000	4081000	I swear I read something, or maybe I'm getting it
4081000	4083000	Mixed up with another popular gaming show around the time
4083000	4085000	So, my bad
4085000	4087000	Alright, well, we're awfully reminiscent
4087000	4089000	About classics right now
4089000	4091000	What a perfect time for us to bring in
4091000	4093000	Dark Sakura's classic game of the week
4093000	4095000	It's a chance for us to pay
4095000	4097000	Respect to our elders a little bit
4097000	4099000	The elder games, that is
4099000	4101000	Dark Sakura's going to sift through her massive archive
4101000	4103000	And pick a game to share with us tonight
4103000	4105000	Dark Sakura, what have you picked
4105000	4107000	For the masses tonight? I have picked
4107000	4109000	Rival Schools, United by Fate
4109000	4111000	And I want to play the intro music
4111000	4113000	Wait, you want to play the intro music
4113000	4115000	Or you want to play the... No, I want to
4115000	4117000	Play some of the intro music for everybody
4117000	4119000	Because this has the best intro
4119000	4121000	Okay, well, give me a minute, because I got to pull up the intro
4121000	4123000	Tell them a little bit about the game, then we'll have the intro music
4123000	4125000	Well, it's a fighting game, and it's put out by Capcom
4125000	4127000	And I love this game so much
4127000	4129000	And the name in Japan was
4129000	4131000	Ishiritsu Justice Gakuen
4131000	4133000	Which means Private Justice High School
4133000	4135000	And you have
4135000	4137000	Different students that go to different schools
4137000	4141000	Hold on, intro music
4167000	4169000	Let's talk a little more about this game
4169000	4171000	Oh, well, the other music I picked is my favorite level music
4171000	4173000	The version of this that we had in rotation for a little while
4173000	4177000	Was the one I ripped off of my Playstation disc back in the day
4177000	4179000	So
4179000	4181000	It was
4181000	4183000	Basically
4183000	4185000	It was a 3D fighter
4185000	4187000	And you had a partner
4187000	4189000	But there were actually several students that would go out to the same school
4189000	4191000	Well
4191000	4193000	It was basically, there were students
4193000	4195000	Going missing from the different schools
4195000	4197000	And the students would get together
4197000	4199000	And try to find the people who had gone missing
4199000	4201000	And in the arcade there were
4201000	4203000	Less characters
4203000	4205000	That actually brought in
4205000	4207000	Two of the
4207000	4209000	Actually one of them was
4209000	4211000	One of the characters that had been missing
4211000	4213000	And the other one was one of the teachers
4213000	4215000	But they brought those into the home version as well
4215000	4217000	But the game also had Sakura in it
4217000	4219000	As a
4219000	4221000	Sort of hidden slash helper character
4221000	4223000	Who went to a different school
4223000	4225000	But was friends with some of the other
4225000	4227000	Students
4227000	4229000	So it was pretty cool
4229000	4231000	You would also have
4231000	4233000	Each person would have their own special attack
4233000	4235000	But you could save up
4235000	4237000	Your energy
4237000	4239000	And do a team attack
4239000	4241000	Where they would work together
4241000	4243000	There were some of them who had buff attacks
4243000	4245000	Where the cheerleader
4245000	4247000	Oh god
4247000	4249000	She's so annoying
4249000	4251000	But she'd come up and cheer people on
4251000	4253000	Five power bars
4253000	4255000	Filled up, something like that
4255000	4257000	Or Hinata would come out
4257000	4259000	And you know
4259000	4261000	Grab your hands and go, you can do it, you can do it
4261000	4263000	And you'd get back some of your life
4263000	4265000	Stuff like that
4265000	4267000	Or other people would just have attacks
4267000	4269000	It was very very cool
4269000	4271000	Very bizarre
4271000	4273000	It's definitely
4273000	4275000	It was very popular
4275000	4277000	But I still sort of think it's more one of the niche fighters
4277000	4279000	In my opinion
4279000	4281000	There were also
4281000	4283000	Different counter moves that you could do
4283000	4285000	You know
4285000	4287000	In some cases you could block
4287000	4289000	Some certain special moves
4289000	4291000	In a certain way
4291000	4293000	You'd actually have attack cancels
4293000	4295000	Where you could
4295000	4297000	If you timed your hit just the right way
4297000	4299000	You could cancel out the other person's attack
4299000	4301000	And then both of them would cancel out
4301000	4303000	But if you are already taking some damage
4303000	4305000	It wouldn't decrease any of it
4305000	4307000	In Japan
4307000	4309000	It came out with an extra disc
4309000	4311000	That was called
4311000	4313000	Nekketsu Seishuniki
4313000	4315000	Which had a bunch of minigames on it
4315000	4317000	And we got the minigame disc
4317000	4319000	Except for the biggest notable difference
4319000	4321000	About it was removing the dating sim mode
4321000	4323000	The dating sim mode
4323000	4325000	Nice
4325000	4327000	Was actually where you were a student
4327000	4329000	And you went through a full year of school
4329000	4331000	And you made friends with the characters
4331000	4333000	And you did all this other stuff
4333000	4335000	And then
4335000	4337000	Based on who you made better friends with
4337000	4339000	Determined what moves you would get
4339000	4341000	So um
4341000	4343000	When your school year was over
4343000	4345000	You could play your character
4345000	4347000	In versus mode
4347000	4349000	And the moves were like I said
4349000	4351000	They're based on who you were better buddies with
4351000	4353000	And um
4353000	4355000	That was taken out although I did
4355000	4357000	And I spent 90 bucks on this thing
4357000	4359000	Because I wanted it so much
4359000	4361000	They released
4361000	4363000	A version 2 that had
4363000	4367000	The Nekketsu Seishuniki mode 2
4367000	4369000	That had a more in depth dating mode
4369000	4371000	And had a DDR sort of minigame in it
4371000	4373000	Sort of
4373000	4375000	It was like a dance off mode in the middle of high school
4375000	4377000	It was so crazy
4377000	4379000	But um
4379000	4381000	I also remembered that
4381000	4383000	The funniest thing about me playing through this
4383000	4385000	Because I knew less Japanese then
4385000	4387000	Than I know now
4387000	4389000	Was one of the characters asking me
4389000	4391000	When your birthday was and then when you came to your birthday
4391000	4393000	We would bring you presents
4393000	4395000	Nice
4395000	4397000	It was cool, it was really cool
4397000	4399000	And there was an actual sequel
4399000	4401000	Which was Moru Justice Gakuen
4401000	4403000	Which we got as
4403000	4405000	Rival schools too
4405000	4407000	Pretty much
4407000	4409000	They had
4409000	4411000	They actually had a customized character mode
4411000	4413000	But it was a board game
4413000	4415000	It was actually pretty funny
4415000	4417000	And you had bitch fight mode
4417000	4419000	Is what I call it where you do the little slappy hand fight
4419000	4421000	But the characters in the game
4421000	4423000	There was Batsu, Hinata, Kyousuke, Hayato
4423000	4425000	Ron
4425000	4427000	Her attacks were using a camera
4429000	4431000	There was Shoma who used a baseball bat
4431000	4433000	Natsu who was a volleyball player
4433000	4435000	Roberto who was a soccer player
4435000	4437000	Nagare who was a swimmer
4437000	4439000	All of his attacks were so stupid
4439000	4441000	He wore a speedo and goggles to attack
4443000	4445000	It was just so many good characters in the game
4445000	4447000	It's one of my favorites ever
4447000	4449000	Yes
4449000	4451000	I was really good at it
4451000	4453000	Although my favorite character is the second one
4453000	4455000	Who is that?
4455000	4457000	That would be this girl
4457000	4459000	Who kicks a whole bunch of ass
4461000	4463000	I don't know why I just
4463000	4465000	Picked that over me
4465000	4467000	Oh, Zaki
4467000	4469000	She wears a really long version
4469000	4471000	Of the school uniform
4471000	4473000	Wears a mask and fights with a chain
4473000	4477000	She's really fun
