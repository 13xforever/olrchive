15557	25347	The Old Classic Games Splatterhouse is set to return, Burnout Paradise is getting patched for motorcycle riding, and are arcade ticket redemption machines a form of illegal gambling?
31411	37596	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of the program that Bobby Blackwolf had to censor three times tonight.
37796	44801	Orange Lounge Radio, live at www.allgames.com every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
44861	50165	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and gamer lifestyle.
50545	53467	My BFF in the world, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.
53687	54188	Hi.
54308	54708	How are you?
54848	55549	I'm tired.
55809	56229	Tired?
56589	57450	Because of the sun.
57570	58711	Tired cat is very tired?
59733	60854	Sleepy Jamie is sleepy.
83616	84297	Oh my lord.
84377	84617	No, it's 90.
84737	85718	Oh, okay.
86018	87339	It was 83 last time I checked.
87359	92383	Because I was going to say, when we get into June and July, we're going to have 105, and I'm going to cry.
92403	98588	However, the forecast says that it's going to be 83 on Monday, and then in the 70s, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
98789	99009	Huh.
100070	101391	Well, thank you for the weather update.
101411	103873	You know, people talk about the weather when there's nothing better to talk about.
104633	107195	But we have video games and other things to talk about.
107296	109597	Right, Tech Master Loki, my other BFF.
110498	111359	Yeah, how you doing?
112255	115257	I got a large soda today because it's hot.
133365	134506	DarkSakura Talks About Her Gaming Week
162645	164187	That's what I get when I don't hit the stop button.
164467	165428	Happens a lot here on the show.
179022	182904	So that I can play Seiken Densetsu 3.
183585	191109	And Dan was supposed to bring me back Mario Kart tonight, but I'm sort of like meh about it because we've already had access to the game for like a week.
192110	193590	So I'm kind of meh.
194491	197873	Although lately, I really, really want to play Street Fighter Alpha 2.
200199	201300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
230640	231000	Alright.
231921	234802	Well, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of classic gaming in your future.
236482	237583	I know, exciting stuff.
237863	240644	Let's move over to Loki and see if there's been a lot of classic gaming in his week.
240884	243385	Yes, I played a classic game called Saints Row.
244386	246546	I don't know, it's not really that classic anymore.
248405	248965	It's fun.
249266	254849	You know, we're still... Actually, we downloaded a new map this week because we're bored with the three that they have.
255429	256390	So we wanted the fourth one.
256410	257251	The fourth one's okay.
258051	259532	It's been out for, what, years now.
260032	265616	But, you know, with the internet being blocked at our work, I had to kind of jerry-rig something in order to get to work.
266536	275402	But that was all to just kill time until Grand Theft Auto 4, which I sneaked a early copy of.
276102	276263	And...
278595	279536	What more do I need to see?
279556	283818	I've been looking for this game for, what, years now?
283838	286300	Since the release of Grand Theft Auto 3?
286340	288001	Probably since the last Grand Theft Auto.
288481	289682	San Andreas, yeah.
289862	290442	It's fucking awesome.
292046	319119	it's um they're okay let me just since the game is you know pretty awesome I'll just you know mention my gripes of the game I don't like the soundtrack I think it's lame um I guess I've been spoiled with like Vice City and Grand Theft Auto 3 but I hate the radio stations in uh 4 I think they're crap um let's see I don't like um I don't know it might be just it um
320433	321154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
349327	350127	A couple questions.
350187	352908	Is the game worthy of the perfect 10 reviews it's receiving left and right?
354529	355309	Probably.
355469	358851	I mean, it's not perfect, but it's damn good.
358951	362312	I'd say give it a 9.8 or 9.9, but nothing's perfect.
364173	366714	What is the most obscene thing you've done in the game so far?
367714	368974	The most obscene thing?
369575	372796	Like, thing that is going to shock people like hot coffee.
372936	375097	Thing that is going to make Lord Voldemort...
376001	376702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
396440	400782	I mean, well, other than the countless people that I've been running over in my car.
401282	407765	I would say it's a lot more realistic, so, like, you can shoot someone in the leg and they start hobbling away and stuff.
409165	416148	And also, oh, I went to the strip club in there, and they have, like, you know, pretty explicit lap dances.
416168	419610	Of course, no one's actually naked in there, but, you know, pasties or whatever.
420390	421730	That's pretty explicit.
421770	426391	I mean, you can do three different lap dances as it goes on there.
427052	431033	And one of them has two girls making out on top of you.
431133	432553	So I guess that's pretty explicit.
433273	436114	And there's a girlfriend you get in the game in the very beginning there.
436774	440915	And you can go in for hot coffee, I guess, but it doesn't show anything.
440935	443235	And she actually screams the weirdest things.
443415	444976	Wait, do they actually call it hot coffee?
445516	445676	Yeah.
445696	445776	Yeah.
447028	450770	Yeah, you get the achievement for that for warm coffee, which is funny.
451951	465839	I did see in the video review from IGN, there was a scene, I'm assuming from a hooker you can pick up, but it showed a hooker in your lap bouncing up and down on you in a car, so that's pretty explicit, I guess.
466379	468580	But nothing super over the top yet.
468600	469661	Yeah.
471934	474136	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
490629	491531	Thanks for watching!
504255	509500	You have a percentage of how much they like you, and that'll go down if you don't do their missions.
509520	511701	So the game doesn't let you just do the open sandbox thing?
511722	515545	Because one thing I loved about Grand Theft Auto was just like, you know, I didn't even have to pay attention to the story.
515565	516105	Not necessarily.
516125	517426	You can do the open sandbox thing.
517446	526875	There's actually a mode on the phone that turned it into sleep mode, and that'll turn all the in-game story stuff off, and then you just go and do whatever.
527515	528255	So that's kind of cool.
529316	532136	But yeah, so pretty much just the radio.
533037	534577	The stations are kind of retarded on there.
534777	536378	You can watch TV, which is kind of funny.
536398	537918	You have fake TV shows on there.
538118	538358	Nice.
538978	542479	And I don't know.
542519	543860	That's pretty much it for right now.
544600	569803	Let's go to the chat room, chat.orangelongeradio.com We always invite our listeners to come join us live and participate in our program We read chat comments, take emails and phone calls later on in the show First comment tonight from Sephiroth1215 After reading the soundtrack on wiki, the Grand Theft Auto 4 soundtrack does look like it sucks Too bad, because I love the San Andreas one But, hey, I guess, you know, the best thing about it is Since it is on the PlayStation 3 and 360 custom soundtracks, so
571560	590275	earlier Loki said there's no such thing as a perfect game J-Rod says Silent Hill 1 is perfect to me anyway well yeah maybe to one person and you know be honest this is it's the perfect Grand Theft Auto I think for me and I haven't even delved into like a lot of online stuff yet because you know you can do custom soundtracks so you can fix your major gripe right there
590875	601547	I just didn't like it because in 3 it had some pretty cool stuff like they had a station that was all electro music and that kind of thing and that was really cool and in Vice City all the stations were awesome there.
602067	610777	It's just there's a lot of music that I've never heard of in there and I guess it's kind of cool that it's new and exclusive to the game but at the same time I haven't heard of it and I don't really care for it.
611337	614419	TigerClaw wants to know if you've explored the comedy club area of the game.
614899	616080	I haven't gotten to a comedy club.
616100	621183	The only thing I've gotten to right now is like a cabaret club, and that sucks.
621563	622724	Cabaret is shit.
623344	624405	Do they have a burlesque show?
624425	625245	That would be pretty awesome.
625706	627086	I don't know if they have a burlesque show.
627126	629828	The one time I went in there, they had this really crappy magician.
630288	636092	The second time I went in there, they had some guy rolling around on the stage with doing some sort of western thing.
636652	637613	Western monologue.
637633	637893	You can...
640514	645398	One of the first dates you go on is bowling, so you can go bowl, which is kind of cool.
645718	651022	They have darts, you can do billiards, they've got... Dance Dance Revolution?
651522	655365	They have a game that's like, I think it's supposed to be like Q-Bert in there.
657627	657907	I don't know.
659208	661190	I gotta go for another viewpoint.
661790	664272	DarkSakura, any interest in Grand Theft Auto 4 at all?
664532	664732	No.
665112	665533	Why not?
666093	667274	I just don't like those games.
667694	668275	They're not fun to me.
669065	672032	is it not fun because there's no point?
672433	676141	they're kind of boring senseless violence not your thing?
676602	678385	I like senseless violence I just think they're boring
680009	681630	I agree with Loki.
681650	697296	You've got to open up the cheat codes because the best part of Grand Theft Auto, at least the last one, or I think it was Vice City I was playing that had this, there was the code that would just make the cars appear from the heavens and you could just make like 80 cars pile up and then fire a rocket at them and just make the biggest explosions in the world.
697756	699657	That was my favorite part because fire is awesome.
701024	702285	MyGamingWeek.com
722226	723766	Pretty graphics, fun to play.
724267	726247	Loading times surprised me a little bit.
726267	728948	I don't know if it's just because my PSP is old and maybe I need to get a mini.
729408	733629	But yeah, the loading times kind of surprised me how slow they are in some points.
733709	735429	But it didn't really detract from the experience.
735469	737970	It's just that I noticed it, which says something there.
738370	741210	But the other game I've actually been playing a lot more of is Patapon.
741430	742251	I bought that game.
742931	745991	And it really was not what I thought it was going to be.
746071	748152	I expected it to be like a straight-up music game.
748872	753114	And certainly music is one element of it, but it was more of like a strategy type of game.
753134	754134	I don't know how to say it.
754174	760417	It's like a, you know, like basically here's the gist of the game for those who haven't played it is that, you know, the screen flashes in rhythm.
760457	763078	Like you'll hear a drum beat that goes do, do, do.
763138	767300	And then you hit the drums, which are the buttons on the PSP.
767340	769541	You only get two drums to start, but you get more later on.
770061	774025	You can hit the drums to issue commands to your little army.
774465	777988	So you might go, and that makes them move forward.
778028	781131	Or you might go, and that makes them attack the enemy.
781551	786635	So not only are you having to think about the music, but you're having to think about, okay, what do I want to have them do next?
786655	787676	Do I want to have them march forward?
787696	788597	Do I want to have them attack?
788617	789698	Do I want to have them retreat?
789738	791119	Do I want to have them defend?
791139	792040	What do I want to have them do?
792420	794102	So that was kind of interesting.
794542	794722	But...
796058	800721	I'll tell you what, the tutorial in the game, not so great, because it took me forever to figure out what was going on.
800841	803842	I was like, why isn't my freaking army listening to me?
804183	806824	And it took me like a minute to get the hang of the game.
806964	808825	I think I needed it to kind of show me a little more.
808865	812287	Maybe I'm just stupid or old or something, but it took me a little bit to get the hang of.
812687	814108	But then once I got in it, okay.
814228	819571	And it's kind of cool that you can slowly build your army up, and there's that whole strategy of making the new...
821092	821873	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
847572	875689	I just never got the hang of it and it's just like too much for me because I don't play a lot of those types of board games and I don't have a lot of I think the easiest way to learn those types of games is to have friends that play them because I think friends teaching you how to play those games is much easier than the Xbox trying to teach you and so I had the hardest time trying to learn Catan because I didn't really play with anyone else that knew it and so I was thinking a lot of Lost Cities I'm probably not going to get it but the card game is actually pretty simplistic yet you know one of those games that has a lot of depth to it so I was kind of surprised um
876309	884298	The only thing is, I'm not sure, you know, when all's said and done, there's not a lot of difference between Lost Cities and Uno.
885138	886300	They're both card games.
886960	890564	They're both, you know, they have the camera support.
890925	892766	They both are pretty quick to play.
893127	896310	Granted, Lost Cities has a little more of strategy, but what is it?
896350	897852	It's a virtual deck of cards, right?
898252	904318	So I'm not sure why Sierra justifies the extra $5 and charges $10 for Lost Cities.
904598	906220	Because there's nothing else there.
906440	908542	Like, you know what, unlockable art, woohoo.
908922	911745	You know, there's not a lot to really justify that extra price.
912045	916289	So like, if I was a brand new Xbox owner and I wanted a card game, I'd go for Uno first.
916670	918671	But Lost Cities isn't bad, it's just...
919707	920628	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
938871	944234	You're trying to make numerical sequences from 2 to 10 on 5 different colors, which represent cities.
946375	950418	If you are going to start building on a color, you have to make a 20-point investment.
950818	954981	You have to hope that you play enough cards that will add up to 20 or over by the time the deck is out.
955521	958823	In addition to those, there are these multiplier cards that you can play first.
958843	959903	They're called investment cards.
960344	964306	You can double, triple, or quadruple the amount of points that you'll earn from
964586	968207	But you're also quadrupling the amount of points that you sacrifice to open up the city.
968247	969828	So it's kind of interesting.
972568	978590	Katamaris Forever says in chat, Except Uno is appealing to housewives and schoolchildren, and Lost Cities is for the uber-hardcore.
979050	982471	That may be true, but it still doesn't justify the extra price to me.
982511	983132	You know what I mean?
983152	983852	It doesn't seem like there's...
985794	997178	Actdeft says Strip Uno on Xbox Live with a cam.
997198	999059	Well, you could play Strip Lost Cities too, I guess.
999539	1001239	I'm not sure exactly what the rules for that would be.
1001620	1004180	You don't need a webcam and an Xbox to play Strip Uno.
1004400	1004921	That's true.
1005421	1008742	You could just have a bunch of people in the house and booze and then be naked.
1009617	1012098	That's probably better anyways.
1012278	1018440	Real in-person naked is better than... Then you can see hoo-hoos and ha-has IRL.
1018801	1021642	But unless there's some people in this world who shouldn't be naked.
1024375	1027936	And those are the people playing Strip Uno on Xbox Live, probably.
1028056	1030057	Yeah, but they probably don't have pictures of themselves.
1030077	1031137	They probably hired, like, a model.
1031957	1033118	Look, boobies.
1033478	1044801	You know, I've got to wonder if, like, on XTube or Pornotube or any of those sites, if there is, like, a taped Strip Uno game or something that's on those sites.
1044961	1047742	I don't know why I have that curious thought.
1047802	1049783	But, you know, I'm thinking of...
1050643	1062913	I'm just wondering how Strip Uno would work since it takes so long to do one game I mean maybe it's like you have like if you do a draw four then you have to remove four articles of clothing or something that might work
1074210	1076471	or, you know, a draw two, you remove two things.
1076491	1082193	That could be the thing, is that if you get a draw four and play it on you, then either you draw four cards or you gotta take something off.
1083073	1084314	Like, it could be a choice thing.
1085194	1086114	That might be interesting.
1086314	1087195	That would be interesting.
1087715	1089655	Not that we're encouraging people how to play.
1089675	1091216	No, I don't think it should be a choice thing.
1091236	1092617	I think you should just have to.
1095077	1095418	Alright.
1095998	1100179	Anyhow, we better... Gerardimo's laughing my ass off.
1100219	1102220	He says, Gerardimo says, I love Jamie's take on this.
1103769	1107334	She always is here to give us a refreshing perspective from a female point of view.
1108055	1108796	Boobs are great.
1111423	1113124	Anyhow, that's our gaming week.
1113164	1114565	Let's get into housekeeping tonight.
1142223	1152005	It's one of, I think, eight rare Grand Theft Auto 4 custom paint job type systems that was given from Gamerscore Blog to All Games Radio.
1152025	1153085	Let me remind you how it works.
1153125	1155346	We went over it last week, but I'll say it one more time.
1156206	1159387	We're going to have a bunch of people submit to us little radio things.
1159587	1162427	You know how Grand Theft Auto has the little radio stuff in the game?
1162667	1163827	How is it in Grand Theft Auto 4?
1163867	1165608	Lots of funny parodies and things that you hear on the radio?
1165628	1166408	There's funny commercials.

1268868	1270689	We're separating all the entries in another folder.
1270929	1276852	Or if you don't have fancy MP3 recording stuff but you just have a really good idea, that might be good enough to win.
1276872	1282314	1-877-GAME-OLR whenever we're not live or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
1282334	1283755	You can do that either way you want.
1284195	1285376	So there you have it.
1285776	1289217	So we hope to get some more entries this week.
1289377	1290298	And set people on fire.
1290578	1293981	and by the way, we listened to one today and I don't think we're going to play it tonight.
1294001	1295302	We'll play it for you guys next week.
1295683	1296584	We listened to one today.
1296664	1304271	Somebody did it out there just for fun because unfortunately he lived in Europe and unfortunately our friends overseas are ineligible because it's an NTSC console.
1304551	1311237	He lives in Belgium to be specific and sent us a commercial and I'll tell you what, it was so funny, I cried laughing.
1311417	1311858	It was great.
1314600	1315781	for what people should do.
1316182	1318344	I know, but at the same time, I don't want 10 copies of that.
1318584	1320325	I want people to come up with their own original thing.
1320445	1321026	Makes sense, right?
1321146	1323128	So we'll play it next week when it's almost over.
1324049	1326851	And that way you can hear a really good one.
1326871	1330695	And then we'll play the other qualifiers for you guys pretty soon.
1332096	1335697	Alright, and Nintendo Maniac64 says, does it have to be MP3?
1335777	1339238	No, you can use AAC, Wave, well, Wave might blow up our inbox.
1339958	1344120	As long as Adobe Audition can open it, or Winamp, we'll play it.
1344800	1346620	Just try not to blow up our inbox, that's all.
1348001	1348261	Alright.
1349561	1351042	Alright, that's going to do it for housekeeping.
1351362	1360805	If you're not already there, join our LiveJournal, join our MySpace, join our Facebook, go to our website, orangelaunchradio.com, and listen to some gaming news, courtesy of Loki.
1361638	1373688	So yes, part of a deal that EA had with Milton Bradley, they will be publishing Monopoly for the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.
1374048	1379933	I think it's kind of funny because EA is trying to get a Monopoly on sports games.
1380473	1382095	Oh, karma.
1382295	1382735	It's funny.
1382895	1383556	Har har.
1384136	1384857	I see what you did there.
1386107	1391837	But apparently this is going to be a sped up version of the original game with some interactive mini games thrown in.
1392918	1398949	And I don't know, doesn't really look like there's going to be a PS3 version at all.
1400350	1401671	It's Monopoly, what can I say?
1402431	1406393	That makes sense, because Monopoly never ends, so there needs to be some type of sped up version.
1406413	1409915	I mean, Monopoly does end, I suppose, but it can go on forever.
1410115	1414698	Don't get me wrong, if this came out on Xbox Live Arcade or something, I'd probably pick it up.
1414858	1415478	But it's not!
1416119	1419641	It doesn't sound like it is, considering it's going to be on Wii and PlayStation 2 as well.
1419661	1421722	It really doesn't sound like it could be on Xbox Live Arcade.
1421802	1423203	It could do retail versions, though.
1423223	1424323	I mean, look at Puzzle Quest.
1424463	1425104	Okay, true.
1425264	1429106	I mean, anything's possible, but I don't know, doesn't it seem likely that maybe that's not the route they're going?
1430558	1431398	Well, it is EA.
1431418	1434159	They like whoring their shit out, so... I don't know.
1435200	1438221	Hey, maybe it'll support webcams on 360, then you can play Strip Monopoly.
1439041	1439542	How's that sound?
1440682	1448785	Not as much fun as in real life, and if you play Strip Monopoly, you'll just get bored and pissed off at everybody else before anyone's naked.
1451860	1454002	Monopoly is kind of boring after a while.
1454022	1456003	Strip Monopoly would have to have like lap dances.
1457124	1463410	No, seriously, because you know how you win all of your money, but you have to have the option of being able to spend it on getting someone to get naked.
1463430	1465111	Okay, here's how you play Strip Monopoly.
1465151	1466332	Here's my idea for Strip Monopoly.
1466632	1469034	You replace the chance and community chess cards.
1469054	1471176	Like, you know, the kind of stuff in there was like lame.
1471496	1475179	Like it was like you win second place in a beauty contest, collect $10, right?
1475219	1475780	Remember that stuff?
1476060	1478102	You need to replace those with X-rated things.
1480234	1483797	Like, you won second place in a crotchless underpants contest.
1484257	1486859	That's right, now it's time to show your community chest.
1489481	1490382	Luxury tax.
1491903	1496226	Anyhow, so Monopoly's coming out on all those systems.
1496406	1497967	Do you think other board games to follow?
1498307	1500629	Could we strip Risk in our future?
1500849	1502491	Well, remember, I think they were talking...
1503574	1504335	Thank you for watching!
1520470	1524213	Gerardimo says in chat, there would be cheap hotels in Strip Monopoly.
1524233	1531477	You know what I would like to see as... You get houses, and then you have a by-the-hour motel that you build.
1531637	1531938	Yeah.
1532538	1534459	You know what I would like... Oh, that'd be funny.
1534559	1537581	Monopoly Red Light District Edition or something like that.
1538322	1546047	I would like to see... I don't think this is Milton Bradley, but I would like to see them do an Xbox Live Arcade version of Heroes Quest.
1546587	1550308	Remember that game was kind of like a halfway between like a board game and Dungeons and Dragons?
1550609	1551549	Oh yeah, kind of, yeah, yeah.
1551869	1552689	Or what was that other game?
1552709	1558792	They had another game that was like something with volcanoes or something like that and they had little marbles that you could roll down and it would... Marble Madness?
1559072	1559952	No, it wasn't Marble Madness.
1560372	1560532	Hmm.
1560592	1560952	I don't know.
1561573	1564234	Marble Madness had things that shot balls.
1567315	1567795	Let's see.
1569095	1569495	What was it?
1569575	1573257	Oh, Actdeft in chat said, Risk, conquer the world without your pants.
1574383	1577486	Hey, they were bringing out Strip DDR and that made me think of Pantsless Rage.
1578947	1579808	Alright, anyhow.
1580349	1581109	Forget it.
1581249	1584332	Now the chatroom is just going to light up with Strip insert board game here.
1584372	1585253	It's not funny anymore.
1585594	1587655	Although, Strip Ants in Your Pants is kind of funny.
1589657	1592060	Yeah, they dump the ants in your pants and you strip to get them out.
1592160	1593341	Strip, don't wake daddy.
1596420	1598341	Strip Hungry Hungry Hip All right, forget it.
1598681	1599001	Rob.
1599161	1599441	What?
1599601	1599921	Rob.
1600001	1600762	How about more news?
1601082	1601302	No.
1601702	1607764	All right, let's move on and get away from such silly teehee nudity chat.
1607844	1609025	But naked is great.
1609545	1612306	Let's get away from teehee nudity chat and talk about violence.
1612486	1612846	Woohoo!
1613607	1618648	And you gotta love a classic violent franchise called Splatterhouse.
1618709	1619729	You remember Splatterhouse?
1620103	1623447	Yes, it was for the TurboGrafx-16 slash PC Engine.
1623527	1626450	Because the main guy looked like a rip-off of Jason.
1627171	1629073	I know, and that game goes sort of annoying sometimes.
1629274	1630094	Well, guess what?
1630255	1637943	On the latest cover of EGM, they're talking about 35 different retro revivals, and right there on the cover, Splatterhouse.
1639454	1654467	so Splatterhouse apparently is going to be coming back for a new wave on all the next gen consoles not a lot else known about the game at this time but I suppose when this magazine starts floating around out there we'll know a little bit more about it
1656454	1665659	Well, it was, it was, the story though was fairly unique from, you know, the whole, the story wasn't a rip-off of Friday the 13th.
1665779	1671783	Right, it talks about Splatterhouse has an ancient Mayan mask that is strapped onto his corpse or whatever.
1673063	1675605	Yeah, and he has to go save his girlfriend.
1676025	1677706	So, interesting.
1677726	1679087	Who's probably already dead.
1679327	1680948	I wonder if it'll be like a first-person game.
1680988	1682949	Probably not, because they have the title character right here.
1684410	1686091	No, it's probably going to be another platformer.
1686881	1687582	We'll see what happens.
1687802	1688302	More details.
1688322	1688662	I hope.
1688702	1689503	Don't butcher it.
1689943	1692245	Butcher characters in the game, but don't butcher the game itself.
1693326	1693666	We'll see.
1693826	1695507	Speaking of butchered, not really.
1697889	1703272	For our buddies over in Europe, they've got a date for Super Smash Bros.
1703332	1706555	Brawl and it's going to be June 27th.
1707135	1711458	Also, in addition to that, WiiWare will be out on May 20th.
1711778	1714260	So, put it in your diary.
1714280	1715481	It's coming.
1715501	1715901	It's coming.
1717737	1719678	Dear Diary, today I played Strip Clue.
1747799	1750422	It was Miss Scarlet in the billiard room with my... Never mind.
1752425	1753046	Let's move on.
1753326	1754227	More stories, please.
1754628	1757832	I don't know if they would consider that concealed weapon, but it was concealed.
1757852	1761216	Let's see here.
1761596	1763559	So there's a company called Shadowbane.
1763719	1765181	What is wrong with this show?
1765785	1769166	That's working with Nintendo to make an MMO.
1769466	1772727	And the question is, they didn't really say what the MMO was.
1773087	1777088	They're just calling it an as-yet-unnamed MMO project.
1777688	1784770	But people are starting to think, hmm, perhaps are they developing Animal Crossing for the Wii?
1785530	1787611	Or is it just going to be another MMO that, you know...
1788536	1790118	Just wait until E3.
1790279	1791901	I mean, enough with the speculation.
1792361	1792822	You know what I mean?
1792842	1795386	You're not going to find out any more details until E3.
1795626	1802596	Obviously, Nintendo runs a very tight run ship where everybody's mouths are sealed and they can't say anything about it, no matter who's developing it.
1802656	1803437	So just wait.
1804278	1812540	I think it's inevitable the game is coming eventually, but I think it would be kind of funny if Nintendo surprised us and didn't announce the game at E3, but kind of came out of left field with something completely different.
1812640	1814120	Now, think about it.
1814160	1817041	Would you really want an MMO for Animal Crossing?
1817781	1819601	Yeah, who's to say it's not a completely new IP?
1819881	1820341	You never know.
1821681	1824222	Mario Brother... Oh, Super Mario RPG.
1824682	1826882	Or Super Mario MMORPG.
1827182	1827943	I don't know about that.
1828063	1829703	I don't know how you'd make that work, but...
1830681	1834344	Everyone's like plumber class or princess class.
1834364	1835184	Princess class.
1835204	1836145	You know I'd have to play that.
1836565	1837846	Or a toadstool class.
1839507	1840688	I don't know.
1840968	1841889	Maybe you're on to something.
1841969	1842329	Who knows?
1842389	1843550	Maybe you could do something like that.
1844031	1847493	Copyright, patentpending.com.
1848734	1849214	P.S.
1849935	1850175	Money.
1851482	1852183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1880363	1881203	This game made my pants hurt.
1906852	1929515	exactly and anyone can read those reviews of course this channel is going to be free and pretty much all the features that you've come to expect from the Japanese version will show up in this version as well so it's just a matter of when this is going to show up but sometime in the next month so that'll be pretty cool sooner rather than later right now everyone's a critic Nintendo's encouraging it
1930276	1934919	Oh, there's something else that Nintendo themselves is going to be criticized for.
1935339	1935699	What's that?
1936219	1948066	Well, there was a discussion going on with Iwata that was after they've gone through all their, I guess, financial meeting that they go through, like any big company has.
1949146	1957713	and he's quoted as saying that their projection for the year is not based on hardware cuts and they are not going to need them.
1958394	1966080	So translated from corporate to real English, that means we're still making money, so forget it.
1966140	1966961	We're not going to lower prices.
1968311	1970273	I wouldn't think they're low prices anyways.
1970293	1978982	They're having problems keeping enough stock for this hardware for portables and consoles.
1979022	1982826	The demand's not going down for any of them, so there's no reason to lower the prices.
1982846	1983467	That'd be stupid.
1983807	1984608	Oh, we're sold out of it.
1984628	1985969	People just want to buy it.
1985989	1986510	They'll buy it for $700.
1986550	1988011	Let's drop it to $99 because we don't like money.
1989793	1990834	Well, there's more.
1991754	1999380	So far, they've sold 25 million Wii and they've sold 70 million DSs.
2001322	2006726	The sales are up 73% for the financial year with 47.7% profit.
2006746	2007927	So that's not bad at all.
2011920	2018666	And there was some other news that came out there that are upping their allocations of what they're going to be making each month for the Wii.
2019026	2023690	From 1.6 million units being manufactured to 2.4 million.
2024451	2030196	So hopefully that will ease the retailers' pain out there, but I don't think it's enough.
2031717	2032978	But they will conquer the world soon.
2034199	2034460	Soon.
2035867	2037528	Another franchise is hoping to-
2051477	2055680	Even though they're not going to lower the price of the Wii, are they ever going to come out with these different modifications?
2055760	2058242	Or is that something else they want to wait to pull out of the hat?
2058282	2061744	I think that's something that you want to bring out when the demand starts to drop.
2061784	2065587	Because people are like, it gives them another reason to buy the console.
2065647	2078556	I don't think that right now, until the demand starts dipping down a little bit, until they start flattening out the demand versus what they've got in stock, I don't think you're going to see any of these new colors or price drops or any sort of bundles or whatever.
2078576	2079037	Because they don't...
2079497	2079757	DarkSakura.com
2090109	2096775	Well, one franchise that's making a return pretty soon, which is pretty cool, actually, is Earthworm Jim.
2097396	2099438	They're actually relaunching the franchise.
2099458	2111889	They're going to be doing a brand new cartoon series, as well as some new video games that are going to be coming to platforms all over the place, including, hopefully, PlayStation 2, 3, and Xbox 360 and Wii.
2111949	2112009	And...
2115811	2122355	No word yet on when this is all going to happen, but hopefully very soon.
2122516	2126858	So we'll see some more Earthworm Jim probably this year maybe.
2128620	2128940	Hmm.
2129580	2132362	Why do you think all of a sudden they want to bring back this one?
2133043	2133263	I mean...
2133951	2135992	I don't know, why bring back Bionic Commando?
2136112	2137472	Or Splatterhouse, I guess, huh?
2137712	2140894	I guess retro is all the rage, so why not bring back Earthworm Jim?
2141274	2145576	I know that game always used to crack me up simply for the fact that when you turned it on, like, remember the title screen?
2145596	2147736	It was somebody burping the name Earthworm Jim.
2149357	2150537	And it wasn't a bad game, either.
2150557	2152058	It was kind of cute for a Super Nintendo game.
2152078	2153819	That's the system I had it on, was Super Nintendo.
2155840	2158280	Wasn't that one of the games that Tommy Tallarico scored, too?
2158301	2158601	I think so.
2158621	2160061	It's one of the games he's kind of famous for.
2161262	2161862	Good times.
2163615	2164975	Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2
2188340	2189921	is going to be coming to the Virtual Console.
2189981	2194764	By the way, just an FYI, Clayfighter and Boogerman are also on their way out.
2195124	2197465	Both also the Genesis versions of the games.
2197505	2198186	Clayfighter is great.
2198246	2199547	Clayfighter is fucking awesome.
2199567	2205110	Clayfighter is pretty rad, although it's one of those games, I don't know, for me, like you play it for an hour and then the joke's old.
2205790	2206250	You know what I mean?
2206571	2208752	It's all about Helga with her opera attack.
2208892	2209753	What about Frosty?
2210293	2211514	Bad Mr. Frosty, whatever his name was.
2211534	2213154	I used to always play as the Blob.
2214335	2215056	That was my favorite.
2215216	2215336	Blob.
2215376	2215696	Awesome.
2217262	2218523	Bad Mr. Foxy was great.
2218843	2221325	Ranma says the Genesis version has an extra level, doesn't it?
2221785	2222285	I'm not sure.
2222305	2223606	I'm not sure.
2224466	2226007	Well, all those games are on their way out.
2226788	2227748	So soon.
2227788	2228469	We don't have a date.
2228529	2231351	But usually when these games are announced, there's less than a month to go.
2232331	2233052	So there you go.
2233632	2238975	Actdeft in chat real quick says, Tiger Claw, Tommy Tallarico is working on the new Earthworm Jim, or so I heard.
2239055	2239636	Rumor alert.
2240676	2241197	Rumor alert.
2241597	2241897	Where are you?
2243311	2250314	Well, you know, especially for those of us who are artists would probably have found this really hilarious.
2250914	2255156	But you know the deal with the Okami Wii cover with the IGN watermark?
2255736	2257897	Oh yes, the hilarity that ensued last week, yes.
2258057	2263799	Which is really funny because I don't see why they bother watermarking it in the first place when it's actually Capcom's art.
2264019	2266800	So it's sort of like, we're going to put our name on it.
2267440	2268000	It's ours now.
2268020	2268320	No.
2270229	2284036	Anyway, because of this clusterfuck of craptitude, Capcom has released two new covers that you can go on their website and... What?
2284836	2287238	No, I'm laughing because I think this is just a stupid idea.
2287378	2287678	Sorry.
2288331	2290473	I just want the covers to begin with because they're pretty.
2291554	2300122	But if you go to Capcom.com slash art redemption, all one word, you can pick one of two covers.
2301884	2307650	You can actually either get the original or two special versions that they have.
2308550	2320735	and one of them is a completely painted green background with the wolf and a neat looking other side on the back and the other which I personally like.
2321415	2327838	It looks like some level artwork with the wolf superimposed in the front where the front cover would be and cherry blossoms.
2328678	2329999	And I like that one better myself.
2330478	2330839	Art Redemption
2347893	2348833	Oh, I think you can.
2348873	2351014	But, I mean, it's just funny.
2351234	2356396	I think the thing is silly because, honestly, how many people are going to do that when there's the more hilarity of... I'm doing it right now.
2357056	2360818	OMG, I have the uber rare watermarked cover.
2361418	2361738	I don't know.
2361858	2366880	Or even better, you just get one of those and you're like, oh, hey, look, there's a GameSpot watermark on there now.
2369061	2369541	You never know.
2370287	2374089	but hey, free game covers and Jamie's ordering one right now even though she doesn't have the game.
2374629	2379491	Oh, VS Jason SV says they don't ask for a serial number so yes, you can do it.
2379511	2380752	They don't and I'm ordering one right now.
2381292	2381532	Nice.
2382693	2383313	Can you order two?
2383333	2384254	Can you go in for the studio?
2384354	2385214	No, let's just pick one.
2385294	2385974	I have to go order one too.
2385994	2386755	I'm getting the pretty one.
2387255	2387915	Alright.
2387935	2388656	The one with the cherry blossoms.
2388676	2390076	I'll get the ugly one then for the studio.
2390216	2392237	I'm going to let my friend know who really loves this game too.
2393098	2393458	Very cool.
2394928	2401789	So there's some pretty cool mods that are out there right now for Unreal Tournament 3, although this one seems to kind of take the cake right now.
2402790	2405130	Super Mario Bros., they made a Super Mario Bros.
2405490	2414292	Unreal Tournament 3 mod, and what it is basically is it's kind of like a 2D version of Unreal Tournament, but with Super Mario Bros.
2414332	2415112	themed levels.
2415532	2421013	So you can run around kind of like, I don't know, Super Smash Unreal Tournament or something like that.
2422374	2427218	It is available to download off of the Epic MegaGames forums.
2427738	2438427	So check out EpicGames.com, check their forums, and you'll find a link to UT2D Super Mario Beta for the PC and PlayStation 3.
2438567	2439928	So that's kind of cool.
2440068	2442931	I hope more games support mods and we see more things like this.
2444518	2445999	And these are things I can download to the PlayStation 3?
2446399	2451341	Yeah, you can download any of the PC mods for Unreal Tournament 3 for the PlayStation 3.
2451381	2454242	There's a great niche for the PlayStation 3 right there.
2454282	2458804	I kind of hope they explore more things like that with the customizations and more games.
2458824	2462365	I know we talked about that when this whole game first came out, but to actually see kind of the...
2465126	2465966	Metamorphosis of that.
2465986	2466326	It's pretty cool.
2466346	2467667	And this is only scratching the surface.
2467727	2476610	I mean, think of all the games out there using the Unreal Engine that they did total conversions for and made a completely different game out of the whole thing.
2477030	2482012	I mean, you're going to see some of these come out and then you're going to actually be able to play these on your PlayStation 3.
2482352	2489594	So Unreal Tournament will essentially become all these different games, which is pretty awesome and definitely worth replay value.
2491975	2492415	Very cool.
2493296	2493376	Uh...
2494468	2497101	DJ Janiya said, I played that over at my friend's house.
2497182	2497744	Good God.
2500034	2507956	Alright, let's do one more story here, and then we're going to get into some release dates, but this could affect a lot of different releases coming out soon.
2508616	2512057	The Wii end-user license agreement was recently updated.
2512097	2518278	You know all that legal blah blah blah that usually you don't even read and you just bother to click accept, you know, just kind of go through it.
2518298	2521699	I don't know, Jamie, do you read every word on those end-user license agreements?
2522620	2522900	Huh?
2522920	2525480	You know those things you have to click accept to, all the legal blah blah blah?
2525500	2526621	I know what you mean when my reply was huh?
2526721	2527221	Yeah, exactly.
2527621	2528121	Alright, uh...
2529727	2544839	Well, the Wii just recently updated theirs, and the interesting thing about it, I mean, I could read this whole thing, but basically the part you want to know is that the Wii console and the Wii Network service are not designed for use with any unauthorized device or any non-licensed accessory.
2545219	2549283	You may not use any such device in connection with your Wii console or Wii Network service.
2549723	2552225	If you do it, it's illegal, voids the warranty, blah, blah, blah.
2552245	2557329	So it's interesting that they updated this to specifically target unlicensed accessories, but...
2557429	2563451	Do you think that has to do with the recent surgence of all these fake Mario Kart wheel things we've seen?
2583396	2584656	I need an NES Advantage update.
2607273	2608834	Let my NES Advantage work with the Wii.
2609094	2609694	You know what?
2610054	2611855	They should come out with an NES Advantage controller.
2611895	2612635	You know what?
2612655	2616816	There were the official items that had turbo buttons and crap.
2617617	2626820	Even NEC got it right with the TurboGrafx and PC Engine that it had a turbo switch on there that you could put it up to three.
2627900	2633102	So I don't see what the big deal is with cheats or anything.
2633857	2639241	Remember on the NES Advantage, I think it was that one, they had a slow button, too, that was just the start button being hit really quick?
2639521	2640662	You know what was great about that?
2640882	2641082	What?
2641642	2642363	Shooting games.
2642803	2643123	Mm-hmm.
2643623	2645044	Like Life Force.
2646205	2651929	Unless every time you hit pause, it goes do-do-do-do-do, and then pauses or whatever, and then so if you get that, like, it doesn't work.
2652549	2653070	It's horrible.
2653330	2654491	You just hear that noise over and over.
2655925	2657526	It worked great on, like, ice hockey, though.
2657806	2658526	That's what I remember.
2658866	2660927	I still have an NES Advantage out here somewhere.
2660967	2663047	I know we used them in one of our photo shoots that we did.
2663067	2663327	I have one.
2663667	2664148	It was fun.
2664228	2665188	I also have a robot.
2666448	2667169	Rob the robot.
2667189	2667249	Yep.
2667789	2669449	All right, well, let's get to some release dates.
2669509	2671330	Let's start over in the UK, shall we?
2671912	2674194	Okay.
2674494	2675435	Stuff is coming out.
2675495	2676315	Really only two games.
2677096	2679518	On the 29th, you get Grand Theft Auto 4.
2679958	2680359	Yippee.
2681079	2685803	And on the 2nd of May, Dream Pinball, which I'm actually more excited about than Grand Theft Auto 4.
2687532	2693498	and just a few other things that are going to be coming out in the month that's pretty good is the pool party.
2693779	2694259	No, I'm kidding.
2695941	2702668	It's been listed Rock Band heading out, Death Junior, the Iron Man game and Apollo Justice.
2702828	2704530	So you have that to look forward to coming up in May.
2706516	2720007	For the US, we're getting Baseball Mogul 2009 on the PC, Toy Shop on the DS, Let's Yoga on the DS, Let's Pilates on the DS.
2720447	2721008	Let's not.
2721588	2723070	Let's Pilates on the DS.
2723971	2737691	Brain Voyage on the DS, Great Wars Nations The Spartans on PC, and then let's see SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 on PSP and PlayStation 2.
2739292	2749179	Then we've got Iron Man coming out on Friday on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PSP, and DS.
2750060	2751761	And then a couple smaller games here.
2752082	2762509	Today we had Mario Kart Wii, and on Tuesday we have Grand Theft Auto 4, but I'm sure no one's really going to be paying attention to that, and that's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2763009	2764130	But what the hell is Grand Theft Auto 4?
2764290	2765811	I mean, seriously, I haven't heard of that game ever.
2765831	2766412	I've never heard of it.
2766932	2767332	Never heard of it.
2767673	2770234	Grand Theft Auto 4 is also coming out in Asia.
2770334	2771515	That's a general release.
2771795	2777199	I usually do Japanese release dates, but also some general Asia release dates that are much broader region.
2777879	2781822	However, I am most confident that is not any type of localized version.
2781882	2787906	It's pretty much just a version of the game from the same one the US and the rest of the world is getting.
2788787	2792249	I don't know if Japan is scheduled to get a translated version of the game.
2792269	2794811	They got one for the other Grand Theft Auto games, didn't they?
2795311	2795712	I think so.
2795892	2796532	Maybe in the future.
2796592	2797653	They got them way late.
2798133	2799154	Yeah, they got them way later.
2800455	2804819	Just like, hey, same reason we have to wait forever for JRPGs to come out over here.
2804959	2806760	Same kind of logic, just in reverse.
2807901	2814967	So honestly, there is not a whole lot coming out because of the whole Grand Theft Auto thing, even though it's not coming out in Japan.
2815207	2815687	I don't get that.
2816128	2819250	But there is, on the Nintendo Wii, coming out in Japan.
2819931	2822593	Pro Yaku Family Stadium is coming out.
2823173	2824074	That's baseball.
2824094	2824174	Yeah.
2824554	2825495	This is interesting.
2825996	2827198	Link's Crossbow Training.
2827278	2832004	I didn't realize we got it way before Japan, but it is just now making its way to Japan on May 1st.
2832044	2833546	The Wii Zapper and Link's Crossbow Training.
2834107	2835128	Yeah, they aren't missing much.
2835308	2838433	Whenever you see the pro-yaku, that's baseball.
2838953	2839694	Baseball.
2839734	2841657	Well, who doesn't love... Excuse me.
2843075	2843636	Excuse me.
2844056	2844536	I'm dying.
2844616	2845537	Rob's dying.
2846098	2846858	I get his stuff.
2846938	2847579	Live radio.
2847779	2848119	Jesus.
2848820	2849660	Nintendo DS.
2849821	2850601	May 1st.
2851062	2852483	A bunch of stuff comes out.
2852863	2854224	Most of it is just peripherals.
2854464	2858648	For instance, you can get a new shiny pouch and a touch pen in all these different colors.
2858968	2860709	However, there are some games coming out as well.
2860889	2862671	Emblem of Gundam is coming out.
2863512	2872479	Katekyo Hitman Reborn Fate of Heat comes out on the Nintendo DS as well as Anpanman to Asobo ABC Kyoshitsu.
2872499	2872679	Anpanman
2872759	2873920	Panmon!
2873940	2875682	Panmon is great.
2876042	2876763	He looks like bread.
2877444	2879606	Well, he gets his own DS game very soon.
2879766	2883570	And on the Sony PSP, Nippon no Asoko Dei.
2884651	2887653	I don't know if that's some type of Japanese traveler game.
2887694	2889135	It's coming out from Sony themselves.
2889415	2892018	It means what?
2892598	2893699	Well, Nippon's Japan.
2893980	2895061	No Asoko Dei.
2895953	2899196	Yeah, that sounds like it would be traveling because it needs to go over there.
2919131	2920072	But probably not for us.
2920092	2921313	That's probably not something you want to import.
2921333	2922974	I'm going to show you what Anpanman looks like.
2923274	2923854	Alright, you do that.
2924215	2925355	Post me a link in chat or something.
2925856	2927217	Oh, that's cute.
2929418	2931760	I'm going to link it in the chat room because Anpanman's adorable.
2932260	2932920	Enough cuteness.
2933000	2933601	More gaming news.
2934041	2935002	I want Anpanman.
2936567	2937448	I wonder if they have any screenshots.
2937548	2942650	Actually, Warrior Bob was over in Japan recently and he IM'd me.
2942971	2945172	So I told him I wanted an Anpanman plushie.
2945572	2945972	Really?
2946653	2947313	Yeah.
2947473	2950655	He asked what cotton game it was I was looking for.
2951936	2952836	It's really cool.
2952896	2954417	I thought it was very nice of him to make it.
2954437	2955878	Make him come back on the show at some point.
2958038	2969721	Speaking of the show, which I should be paying more attention to instead of Anpanman, there's details released about Bionic Commander's multiplayer for anyone who was interested.
2971714	2979378	Now that is only going to be for offline play for Bionic Commando Rearmed.
2980599	2986542	But it will be presented in a zoomed out 2D sort of mode.
2987562	2992885	Sort of, I guess, like the playing a lot of people in Smash Brothers is done, I guess.
2993745	2995926	You have Deathmatch, Last Man Standing.
2998148	3003712	But they say the defining object is going to be your bionic arms.
3003772	3008775	You'll be able to block projectiles, grab power-ups.
3010696	3015160	You'll have that as your only weapon.
3020876	3029163	And then they're also saying is that they've made this 150 megabytes also for the size.
3030424	3032827	So it's going to have some stuff.
3033427	3038632	It will be live arcade, PlayStation Network, and PC in May.
3040833	3044557	Oh yeah, and there's one other mode that you have to go around without touching the floor.
3046959	3047099	Okay.
3048683	3051184	I'm kind of excited to check out the new Bionic Commando game.
3051804	3052565	It's going to be good times.
3053445	3056026	I should call that mode where you don't touch the floor Hot Lava mode.
3056346	3060488	Remember playing Hot Lava in kindergarten or elementary school?
3061268	3061508	No.
3061528	3062609	What the hell is this?
3063049	3066811	It's basically you'd play on playground equipment and the ground was lava.
3066951	3074854	It's like tag, but one person is the lava monster or whatever and they have to stay on the ground where everyone else is up on stuff and you have to try tag them and stuff.
3076024	3079565	God, you're really not up on elementary school recess games.
3079605	3079866	You know what?
3080006	3081526	After the show, let's go play Hot Lava.
3081766	3083007	I know an elementary school year.
3085348	3088269	Now, that would be a funny commercial for our show.
3090149	3092009	We had better games when I was in elementary school.
3092029	3095190	What happens when you take the video games away from the video gamers?
3095210	3096311	We took it a step further.
3096891	3102132	We used to have a game, a tag, that would involve a hula hoop and we'd throw it at each other.
3102552	3110594	Because playing a game like Hot Love or whatever with a very large piece of playground equipment, you can't obviously reach up 12 feet above you.
3110814	3113695	But you can throw a hula hoop at someone's head 12 feet above you, so...
3115134	3116175	DarkSakura.com
3133618	3137363	Okay, apparently, like, everybody knows Hot Lava in chat.
3137964	3138404	You know what?
3138504	3142209	I think there was a game we played that was just like that, except it was Sharks.
3142590	3145513	I think it was Sharks or something like that, where everything was Sharks.
3146575	3147636	I want to say there was a type game.
3147656	3150940	I remember a tag game that you played on Patreon, but it was like Sharks, I think.
3151160	3151481	Same thing.
3152051	3152351	Anyways.
3152871	3153412	Wait, real quick.
3153472	3154012	I got to say this.
3154792	3157233	You know, we all love those playground games from when we were kids.
3157253	3158494	You know, those that we can remember.
3158534	3160035	You know, I remember Smear the Queer.
3160075	3160755	Did you guys play that?
3161375	3161676	No.
3161776	3163316	I remember a bunch of us got busted.
3163757	3165677	A bunch of us got busted for playing that one day.
3166178	3167698	It was something you played with the football.
3168339	3171140	And, you know, whoever, like, had the football was the queer.
3171400	3172581	And you had to run around.
3173121	3173921	It's just horrible.
3174001	3174342	I know.
3174922	3176883	But, you know, the way things turned out, you know.
3179243	3184464	I don't wish to get smeared on a daily basis anymore, but I think that's why we got in trouble for playing it.
3184684	3185685	We used to play sockball.
3186005	3190466	But then everybody would try to grab that person and grab the ball away from them.
3190526	3194426	We would put a tennis ball in a sock and throw it at people.
3196367	3197227	I'm not joking.
3197567	3207109	That reminds me of that scene in what the hell was that movie by Kubrick, the war movie, Full Metal Jacket, where they all put the soap in the sock and start beating the guy with it.
3207506	3211067	Well, the whole point of this is that it's sort of like crazy dodgeball.
3211567	3216249	If you get hit with the sockball, then you have to go out, but you also become one of the people who gets to throw the sockball.
3218310	3218850	It's pretty funny.
3219270	3221291	Anyways, back on topic.
3221391	3223972	I want to say, we never were on topic on this show, damn it.
3224552	3228813	They need to compile a bunch of playground games into a game.
3228913	3231074	I think it's been done before, but not very well.
3231874	3236056	I want to say they need all these classes, but they need it on Xbox Live Arcade.
3237088	3240229	and something like, you know, where everybody's competing to be the king of the schoolyard.
3240269	3241150	Who wouldn't play that game?
3241310	3242250	Like, it's like a bunch of mini-games.
3242270	3242450	I get it.
3242470	3243991	I think it would be fun.
3244311	3253495	But, you know, they should actually do, like, a Simon Says one that uses, like, some sort of motion sensor or the Wiimote so it can tell where you're holding the Wiimote.
3254415	3255016	That might be fun.
3255036	3255816	That would be great.
3258141	3259622	Hold on, I gotta get chat comments.
3259782	3266306	Ranma says the game I was talking about, he says, Sky, that's called a blanket party, and now a highly illegal thing to do in the military.
3266807	3267927	A blanket party.
3269649	3271490	Hey guys, let's play Beach Blanket Bingo.
3275160	3277182	So, Bionic Commando.
3277663	3282948	It's not coming to Virtual Console anytime soon because Nintendo doesn't want it to.
3283489	3293299	And that's, of course, coming from Capcom's Vice President of Strategic Planning, Christian Svensson, who basically says that it couldn't happen.
3293679	3296722	It is up to Nintendo to allow it to happen.
3297103	3297663	Apparently...
3299018	3303219	The thoughts are maybe they didn't like the fact that Hitler's head explodes in the game.
3303579	3305820	Or the fact that, I don't know, Hitler's in the game at all.
3306520	3307780	No, he's Mr. D!
3308660	3315102	We need a fucking new... We need, like, Castle Wolfenstein to come to Xbox Live Arcade.
3315122	3315922	That'd be the shit.
3316162	3316842	With multiplayer.
3317463	3319383	Why don't they just rename him to Smitler?
3320343	3321464	Oh, I know he has another name.
3321924	3322824	But... Boll?
3323444	3325024	Yeah, name him Ui Boll.
3326105	3326965	In Bionic Commando.
3328007	3328489	It was Hitler.
3328569	3329551	But he looked like Hitler.
3330533	3334121	You know how there's some cats that look like Hitler and there's a whole website dedicated to that?
3335114	3336134	This guy looked like Hitler.
3336374	3338035	Well, he was in the Japanese one.
3338255	3338515	Alright.
3339055	3354057	Anyhow, something that will be coming to the Nintendo Wii, however, well, if rumors are to be believed anyway, this is a rumor, big rumor, it was a tip that was sent in to GoNintendo that Metroid Prime is being remade for the Nintendo Wii.
3354377	3363799	Now, keep in mind, Metroid Prime 3 was already on the Nintendo Wii, but the rumor is that 1 and 2 are being remade with all new controls and they will all be packaged into one
3364119	3366661	Comprehensive Metroid Prime game.
3366701	3370163	Like an ultimate box set, if you will, for the Nintendo Wii.
3370483	3370824	Thoughts?
3371864	3375967	Yeah, GameCube port getting some stuck-on waggle controls.
3376307	3377328	That sounds like the Wii.
3380150	3382091	I know, it just sounds like a cheap play for more money.
3382151	3383492	But you know there's people that would buy it.
3384973	3386974	Metroid Prime 2, the search for more money.
3387195	3388115	I was just thinking that.
3388595	3393839	I wonder if they would go back and add stuff to Metroid Prime 3 to kind of attract people that might already have it.
3394653	3396735	Super Metroid Redone in the style of Metroid Prime
3415211	3416452	Don't touch Super Metroid.
3417033	3417533	No, no.
3417773	3419675	Super Metroid is a god among men.
3419695	3431344	I'm saying it not be, of course, the same game, but I would like to see what some of those levels would look like from a different perspective, because I want the music, you know, and everything.
3431687	3432428	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3455031	3455792	Rob, we need an OLR-troid.
3486752	3486972	Cat's Yowl
3518060	3519380	Operetta of the LaserCat?
3519981	3521742	LaserCat Operetta.
3524284	3527886	Okay, it would be Screeching Match of the LaserCat.
3529427	3530488	Chorus, that's it, Chorus.
3531697	3545442	Some comments from chat Sephiroth1215 says Metroid Prime 1 felt a lot like Super Metroid Okay, I disagree with that comment 100% Because when I played Metroid Prime 1 for the first time I seriously, I was like, what the fuck did they do to Metroid?
3545462	3559387	And I threw the controller I did not like Metroid Prime at all when I first played it Now granted, I own Metroid Prime 3 now and it's grown on me this series But I was so mad that they raped Metroid by making it a first player game I was not so warm and friendly on the whole first person conversion
3559727	3566429	J-Rod says they need to go remake and import Eternal Darkness, never mind this Metroid nonsense, to which Siren follows up with, somebody take over Eternal Darkness is a good idea and give more games insanity gauges.
3581821	3582702	E3, Call of Cthulhu, Morphine
3605503	3606904	Some more stuff, how's that?
3607625	3617092	Anyhow, so the Metroid Prime Trilogy may be on its way to Wii, but we would rather Nintendo just put the resources into giving us a new 2D Metroid of uberness on the Wii, but we'll see.
3617432	3619454	Well, I'm very mad at Nintendo right now.
3619534	3619914	Why is this?
3620034	3621135	Pissed off!
3621876	3623817	Not up to F you, pissed offness.
3624457	3628981	But Club Nintendo, this elusive thing, this, you know...
3630660	3637026	Wonderful organization is out in Australia, not in America.
3638207	3645213	For everyone who got their copy of, what game was it?
3646761	3647801	It was from Mario Kart.
3648341	3658163	There was an invitation in there with a code on it that you could use to use that code and get Nintendo Star Points.
3658703	3666024	The site is not active yet, but you can get started on your saving up, I guess.
3668225	3668445	Hmm.
3670285	3670705	Alright.
3670885	3671765	Give it, Nintendo!
3672325	3674866	I know, Nintendo just needs to give it to us in America already.
3675246	3675966	Stop being whores.
3679218	3680999	I don't really know a nicer way to say it.
3681019	3681840	Stop being hoarse.
3681860	3682681	It's awesome.
3682701	3706919	So, you know, earlier this week it's not surprising because, you know, with a big game like Grand Theft Auto 4 obviously people are going to get early and leak it to the internet as they did, but to commemorate such a leakage the notorious BitTorrent site, the Pirate Bay is now calling themselves Liberty Bay with, you know,
3708235	3712458	Nico Bellic of Grand Theft Auto 4 on the front page there.
3713199	3714559	So that's kind of funny, I guess.
3714619	3716120	I love Pirate Bay so much.
3717722	3719623	Wait a minute, should you be admitting that on this program?
3720149	3722490	Yes, because I'll tell you why I love the Pirate Bay.
3725130	3735654	Because of where their servers are located, it's not illegal for them to have and distribute their content, the torrent files.
3735794	3738094	Wait a minute, that's where you get your Doctor Who fix, isn't it?
3742376	3743776	Okay, okay, enough said.
3744961	3769101	but what's funny is that all of these different facilities will send them letters of complaint and use ceases and desist and so they publish them on their front page and make fun of them and point out where what they're doing is legal in the country they're operating from and somewhere out there right now Ross Steel UT is throwing something at his radio no one has been able to shut them down
3770871	3771151	Alright.
3772813	3775836	Well, but just because it's out there doesn't make it right.
3776717	3779080	But it makes it awesome, and they're hilarious.
3779961	3782383	And you know, downloading import TV shows is nothing.
3782543	3784906	I mean, I don't think that should be a big deal, honestly.
3786711	3789814	If they've aired and they're gone and you want to get them, why not?
3790754	3793016	Anyhow, especially if they're never going to air over here.
3793496	3797519	I think somebody ought to upload a torrent of all this, all the old episodes of this.
3797719	3800742	Or actually, they don't need to because all these episodes are online now.
3800842	3801502	Starcade.
3801522	3802403	You remember Starcade?
3802603	3802763	Yes.
3802783	3804504	This show was fucking badass.
3804925	3807667	I remember this show growing up.
3807747	3808367	It was a show.
3808387	3809548	It was hosted by this guy.
3809568	3811669	I think his name was Jeff something.
3812330	3812950	It's been a long time.
3812990	3813771	Jeff, crap in the head.
3813891	3816933	I used to love watching Starcade on G4 and then they got rid of it.
3816953	3817753	Ladybug Cops.
3839685	3840145	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3860237	3861938	And who didn't want that when they were a kid?
3862558	3863579	Dude, I'm going to email these people.
3863639	3866000	I'm going to email these people and see if we can get them on the show.
3866020	3868221	You know what would be great, though, is if they were doing it.
3868381	3874023	I know this was before then, but giving away the SNK machines.
3874063	3874664	That's right.
3874724	3876465	With the multi-card.
3877265	3878245	Dan and I still want one of those.
3878265	3881467	I want to get them on the show because you know I've got to ask that question.
3881947	3883428	Will this show ever come back?
3884093	3884833	Will it blend?
3885153	3887514	If only I had the money, I would bring it back.
3887614	3887954	I know.
3888014	3889095	Well, you don't have the rights to it.
3889135	3890916	You'd have to make up a new video game show.
3890936	3891396	Whatever.
3891456	3892556	I'd buy the rights to it.
3892576	3893897	I mean, really.
3893917	3894477	What are they going to do?
3894537	3895717	Sit on the rights to that?
3895817	3897198	It'd be called OL Arcade.
3898638	3898898	No.
3899239	3899719	Patent pending.
3923434	3924435	It's done out of respect.
3924575	3934039	And if anything, and this also goes back to the argument with music and stuff, if anything, those fan subs probably drive up interest in the actual anime title.
3934479	3939281	And when it comes over here, it would probably fare a lot better than, say, if it wasn't fan sub.
3940042	3944444	DarkTetsuya and Actdeft in chat almost at the same time go, OL Arcade.
3946058	3947618	Thank you for watching!
3969673	3972676	but a little different to not get sued.
3972876	3986448	There was just that one show and I can't remember what it was but it was where you'd have like a partner team and they'd go through this trivia business and then they'd get to run through with these Velcro jackets.
3987689	3990351	Oh, I was just reading about that show on Wiki the other day.
3990371	3991893	I was just reading about it.
3991913	3992934	Somebody in chat will say it.
3993134	3994195	It's not Nick Arcade.
3994255	3994875	It's something else.
3995296	3996557	This predates Nick Arcade.
3998191	3999813	Somebody in chat will say it in a minute.
4000294	4005760	But I used to watch that show all the freaking time, and I so wanted to be on it.
4007932	4009694	Video Power, Credit to Ranma.
4009714	4010875	Video Power, that was it.
4011176	4014059	And there was also GameProTV.
4015281	4017723	Do you know that GameProTV was filmed right here in Sacramento?
4018084	4018424	Was it?
4018584	4018785	Yes.
4019946	4028236	I want to say I read something that they used the Sacramento studios, that it was actually produced by the folks with the NBC station around here.
4030513	4053088	I liked that one because that was the show that first introduced me to a concept that they never really did anything with that I thought was great and I would love to see games actually do this crap and that was the save card for the Neo Geo where you could play in the arcade save your data on the card and go play it on your Neo Geo system at home if you had a game
4054133	4057574	You could kind of do that with like F-Zero type things.
4057654	4058514	You remember that?
4058894	4067917	I know, it's a little shady, but... But I think that bringing back that sort of format for a game would encourage people to purchase the home version, too.
4068657	4070598	If anything, it'd drive sales, I would hope.
4071218	4071538	You know what?
4071578	4075760	I'm going to take back what I said earlier about GameProTV, because it says on IMDb they filmed it in Los Angeles.
4075860	4079641	Maybe it was just that they did a couple one-off shows, but I swear I read something.
4079981	4082582	Or maybe I'm getting it mixed up with another popular gaming show around the time.
4083462	4083582	So...
4084700	4087802	DarkSakura, what have you picked for the masses tonight?
4087822	4089584	I have picked Rival Schools, United by Fate.
4089924	4091165	And I want to play the intro music.
4091305	4091485	Okay.
4112202	4118168	Wait, you want to play the intro music, or you want to play the... No, I want to play some of the intro music for everybody, because this has the best intro.
4118628	4120450	Okay, well give me a minute, because I've got to pull up the intro music.
4120470	4122011	Tell them a little bit about the game, then we'll have the intro music.
4122031	4125855	Well, it's a fighting game, and it's put out by Capcom, and I love this game so much.
4126015	4132862	And the name in Japan was Shiritsu Justice Gakuen, which means Private Justice High School.
4134223	4136905	And you have different students that go to different schools.
4137066	4138087	Hold on, intro music.
4138107	4138307	Okay.
4154759	4166563	The energy of youth.
4166583	4167884	Alright, tell us a little more about this game.
4168044	4171285	Oh, well the other music I picked is my favorite level music.
4171305	4177607	The version of this that we had in rotation for a little while was the one I ripped off of my PlayStation disc back in the day.
4178427	4180928	So, um... It was, uh...
4182483	4189506	Basically, it was a 3D fighter and you had a partner, but there were actually several students that would go out to the same school.
4191327	4198590	It was basically, there were students going missing from the different schools, so the students would get together and try to find the people who had gone missing.
4199190	4200571	And in the arcade, there were...
4202191	4225786	I actually brought in two of the, actually one of them was one of the characters that had been missing and the other one was one of the teachers but they brought those into the home version as well but the game also had Sakura in it as a sort of hidden slash helper character who went to a different school but was friends with some of the other students
4226426	4227466	So it was pretty cool.
4228487	4238811	You would also have, each person would have their own special attack, but you could save up your energy and do a team attack where they would work together.
4239111	4254397	There were some of them who had buff attacks where the cheerleader type, oh my god, she's so annoying, but she'd come up and cheer people on and you'd get five power bars filled up, something like that.
4255749	4263213	or Hinata would come out and, you know, grab your hands and go, you can do it, you can do it, and you'd get back, like, some of your life.
4263533	4264674	You know, stuff like that.
4264774	4266435	Or, you know, other people would just have attacks.
4267975	4269096	It was very, very cool.
4269656	4270637	Very bizarre.
4270677	4271457	It's definitely...
4273638	4278219	It was very popular, but I still sort of think it is more one of the niche fighters, you know, in my opinion.
4280860	4285441	There were also different counter moves that you could do.
4285581	4289322	You know, in some cases you could block some certain special moves in a certain way.
4289342	4300365	You'd actually have attack cancels where you could, if you timed your hit just the right way, you could cancel out the other person's attack and then both of them would cancel out.
4301085	4306088	But if you are already taking some damage, it wouldn't, you know, decrease any of it.
4306329	4314574	In Japan, it came out with an extra disc that was called Neketsu Seishun Miki, which had a bunch of minigames on it.
4314594	4320858	And we got the minigame disc, except for the biggest notable difference about it was removing the dating sim mode.
4322498	4346306	the dating sim mode was actually where you were a student and you went through a full year of school and you made friends with the characters and you did all this other stuff and then based on who you made better friends with determined what moves you would get so when your school year was over you could play your character in versus mode
4347666	4351068	And the moves were, like I said, they're based on who you were better buddies with.
4352008	4357570	And that was taken out, although I did, and I spent 90 bucks on this thing because I wanted it so much.
4358931	4371477	They released a version 2 that had the Neketsu Seishun Niki Mode 2 that had a more in-depth dating mode and had a DDR sort of minigame in it.
4371597	4371977	Sort of.
4373217	4375418	It was like a dance-off mode in the middle of high school.
4376258	4376978	It was so crazy.
4379839	4393022	I also remembered that the funniest thing about me playing through this, because I knew less Japanese then than I know now, was one of the characters asking you when your birthday was, and then when you came to your birthday in that part of the sim, he would bring you presents.
4393042	4393502	Nice.
4394841	4395321	It was cool.
4395361	4396001	It was really cool.
4396141	4408565	And there was an actual sequel, which was Mori Justice Kakuen, which we got as Rival Schools 2, pretty much.
4408905	4412806	They actually had a customized character mode, but it was a board game.
4413007	4413887	It was actually pretty funny.
4415207	4418588	And you had bitch fight mode, is what I called it, where you do the little slappy hand fight.
4419448	4428169	But the characters in the game, there was Batsu, Hinata, Kyosuke, Hayato, Ran, her attacks were using a camera.
4429590	4437251	There was Shoma, who used a baseball bat, Natsu, who was a volleyball player, Roberto, who was a soccer player, Nagare, who was a swimmer.
4437291	4440852	All of his attacks were so stupid, he wore a Speedo and goggles to attack.
4441812	4442052	Hmm.
4443770	4445611	It was just so many good characters in the game.
4445671	4446752	It's one of my favorites ever.
4446792	4451595	Plus, I was really good at it.
4451695	4453196	Although, my favorite character is in the second one.
4454036	4454496	Who is that?
4455277	4458639	That would be this girl who kicks a whole bunch of ass.
4462041	4467124	And I don't know why I just... Oh, Zaki.
4468204	4472607	She wears a really long version of the school uniform, wears a mask, and fights with a chain.
4474784	4475485	She's really fun.
4477427	4477767	All right.
