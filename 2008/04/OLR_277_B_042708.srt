Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,600
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio on this April the 27th of 2008

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,600
to part B of our podcast we tape live every Sunday night at orangeloungeradio.com

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,300
which is just going to refer you right over to allgames.com

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,400
which is the actual radio site where we broadcast.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,000
We like people to pay attention to our own website as well

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,800
because that's where the podcast is hosted which many of you are listening to right now.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,800
But of course, we also have a lot of live listeners who are assembled.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,200
If you're listening live, but you're not in chat, why not?

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,800
chat.orangeloungeradio.com is the place to be

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,000
or for those of you guys on the IRC Game Surge Network, just join Channel Orange Lounge.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
All right, let's get back into some gaming news here in part B of our show.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,600
All right, well we've been talking about some updates coming to Burnout Paradise over the last few weeks.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,800
Recently the, I want to say it was the Bogart patch was released.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,000
Although I didn't see any of the new islands or anything like that, but maybe that's coming later.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,600
But there is another patch that they're talking about coming out later in August code named Davis.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
And this one's actually going to be pretty significant.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's going to be including, for the first time for the series, motorcycles.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,200
And then it will also have night driving as well.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,800
And the motorcycles will have actual passengers on them, which is also another first for the series

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
because the cars are all ghost cars in Burnout Paradise normally.

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:48,000
And the bikes will get their own modes and challenges as well as new locations designed to suit the bikes.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,600
And no word though on what they're going to do with like Showtime mode for riding a bike.

27
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Since, you know, your rider would kind of go flying through the air.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So yeah, that's pretty awesome.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
I guess that's coming in August.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,200
But I'm really looking forward to the expansions for the maps whenever the hell those are going to come out.

31
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,600
What is the obsession with motorcycles and racing games lately?

32
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Because, you know, we had Project Gotham 4, right, added them.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,800
And then we have Mario Kart, Wii is now all of a sudden got motorcycles.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
And now Burnout.

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,800
It's like 2008 is the year of motorcycle.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
Well, I guess Project Gotham came out in 07.

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,600
But still, it's like, you know, all the rage right now.

38
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
What's up with that?

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,600
I don't know, it's something different.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
I guess.

41
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Do you prefer motorcycle racing to car racing?

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I don't prefer either.

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,800
I prefer, well, I'd have to say I like car better.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,600
I think motorcycle racing is much cooler when you have a stick that you beat people with off the side of the car.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:44,800
Road rush?

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Yes, exactly, road rush.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,000
Personally, I'm more of a fan of when they had Need for Speed 2.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
And this is not Underground 2 or anything like that.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
It's like the second Need for Speed game.

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:02,200
They had, like, some crazy codes you could put in to actually race as a bunch of different, like, some of the props on the side of the road and stuff.

51
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,400
Like, you could race as a log, you could race as an outhouse, as a giant T-Rex statue.

52
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,200
What else was in there that was really funny?

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Just, like, a bunch of weird shit.

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
And I always used to love racing the log versus the T-Rex.

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
And I laugh like crazy.

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,000
They had something similar with, I want to say Daytona as well, you could race as a horse.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,200
Now, the nighttime mode sounds cool.

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,800
I like racing at night.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,800
But I think the nighttime, from what I'm looking at here, nighttime is not going to have any cars.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,000
It's just going to be empty.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,400
What?

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,000
It's kind of dumb.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Whatever.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Alright, well, one game we love here at Orange Lounge Radio is the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, I checked the Orange Lounge Radio wiki today.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Since we have no official Wikipedia entry anymore, because some a-hole nuked it, we now have our own wiki, orangeloungeradio.wiki.com.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:01,600
And I was looking at the latest Eye of Judgment sales figures, which now our chatters are tracking for us, just shy of 200,000 worldwide.

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Never going to happen.

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Never going to make a million.

69
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,600
However, for those that do happen to own Eye of Judgment, Sony is somewhat apologizing, I guess you could say, because the second set of Eye of Judgment cards...

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Sorry about it.

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Sorry about this game.

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,600
But there was a second set of cards that got delayed.

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,600
So three rare cards are being given away starting next Friday, but here's what I don't get.

74
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,600
How are they rare if they're giving them away?

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Whatever.

76
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
They're the Eye of Judgment set to promo cards.

77
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,600
All you have to do, you watch the official PlayStation blog starting next Friday.

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,600
And, oh, I see why they're rare, because you have to be one of the first few hundred who registers with the mailing list, and then you get the rarities.

79
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
So only a few hundred of these are going to go out.

80
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Or...

81
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
One of them will be Xeroxed and put all over the Internet.

82
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Or you could just Xerox the ones right there that are available on the website.

83
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
No, no, no, here's the thing.

84
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,600
The ones that are going around blogs, though, you've got to look at those black bars carefully.

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Those black bars are what the Eye of Judgment reads.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
They're all the same on these cards.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
So, not that easy, Loki.

88
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Oh, darn.

89
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,600
I guess we'll just have to wait for one of the hundreds of people that actually...

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Oh, who cares?

91
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
No one plays the game.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
It doesn't matter.

93
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Alright.

94
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Black Wolf is in chat. He actually owns Eye of Judgment. He was a big supporter of trying to move a million copies of them.

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
He says the best part is that you have to pay $14.99 just to use those cards.

96
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Awesome.

97
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Since, you know, you've got to get set, too.

98
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Awesome. Way to support that.

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Good job.

100
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
Sadly, we don't get to count expansion sales towards our million.

101
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Nope.

102
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Doesn't matter anyways.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,600
But we do get to count sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever, let's not forget.

104
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah, all ten of those.

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Well, another game that we're not counting is Portal.

106
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Otherwise, Loki would be in that Tingle suit right now.

107
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
It's a good thing we didn't count Portal.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,600
Well, basically, they have said from Valve that we will not be seeing a new Portal this year.

109
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:03,600
But they are going to do a new game that is as revolutionary, they say, as Half-Life 2 was to the original Half-Life.

110
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
He's quoted as saying, it won't be Portal with different colors.

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,600
So, we're going to be getting something new from Valve.

112
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
I say good for them.

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
You don't want to beat this thing into the ground.

114
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
You know what I mean?

115
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Sequels have so much to live up to with the originals.

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
And granted, in gaming, we often get off a lot better than in movies.

117
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,600
Like, you know, in movies, sequels, like 99% of the time, are crappier than the original.

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Once in a while, you have a rare one that's better.

119
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
But in games, sometimes you get sequels that are more memorable than the original.

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,600
But, you know, you don't want to rush Portal.

121
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You've got to make it right.

122
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
And I'm all for new IPs.

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
You know, Portal was a new IP when it came out.

124
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
So, I'm all for new things that are just as cute.

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Just, you know, will it be good?

126
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Dark Tetsuya in chat suggests, Portal 2.

127
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
No, really, there's cake this time.

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,600
No, no, no, because the cake is made with, like, dust and...

129
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
I say in Portal 2, you're going after pie.

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
What's better than cake?

131
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Pie.

132
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
There you go.

133
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
I had a birthday pie.

134
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
I want a birthday pie.

135
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,600
If I can eat pie by that time, because, you know, the whole pancreas drama.

136
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,600
But you know what's in two weeks for us?

137
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
What, Margaret Cho?

138
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I know.

139
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Your birthday present is a little late.

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,600
Let's get pie.

141
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
If I can eat it.

142
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
It might have to be low-fat Weight Watchers pie.

143
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
We can eat fat-free pie.

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Fat-free cheesecake.

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I'd rather eat barf.

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Well, it's not cake, but it's definitely coming a lot sooner than Portal 2.

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
It is the releases on the PlayStation Network this week.

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:45,600
And there's some pretty interesting stuff, like the EchoChrome demo that's been released out now for, I believe, the PlayStation Portable.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:54,600
And you can also download some PlayStation 1 classics for R-Type, including R-Type 1 and R-Type 2.

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
And that's available for $6.

151
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,600
And they also have, of course, the variety map pack for Call of Duty 4 for PlayStation 3.

152
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:13,600
And if you happen to be a fan of Carrique Revolution American Idol Encore, they've added a variety of new songs you can check out there as well.

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
And let's see here.

154
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Also, of course, the Eye of Judgment Byleth Rebellion 2 expansion set is available download for $15.

155
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
You know, the typical rock band stuff.

156
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Guitar Hero 3 Def Leppard pack.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,600
There's an Army of Two SSE Challenge pack.

158
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Demo for Iron Man on the PlayStation 3.

159
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Resistance Fall Man 2 teaser trailer.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:43,600
And then there's some other stuff from different game videos and stuff.

161
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
And some free stuff.

162
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Eye of Judgment Theme number 2 for free.

163
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,600
And the PlayStation 3 wallpaper for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,600
And on the PSP Store, they're actually still selling full games on there.

165
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Because, remember, you can download full PSP games, including Loco Rocco, which is $21.99.

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,600
They've got, let's see here, I guess that's selling new free game.

167
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Or, well, it's not free.

168
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,600
$21.99, that's a free deal.

169
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Free after $21.99.

170
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Free with $21.99 download fee.

171
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
There's also Kingdom of Paradise, which is $10.99.

172
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
So, I don't know.

173
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,600
That kind of sucks, though, because the money that you put into the PlayStation Store and stuff like that,

174
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,600
it's in whole dollars, so you're stuck with these remainder cents that you get ripped off on in each purchase.

175
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Way to go, Sony.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Alright, well, also on the PSP soon will be Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus.

177
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Yay!

178
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,600
For those fans of Guilty Gear who like their wordy game titles.

179
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
We went through it for Street Fighter.

180
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
This is coming to the PSP.

181
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
They call it the most complete and balanced version of the game to date.

182
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
So, what happens is that also the game's going to have an ad hoc mode.

183
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
You can do three-on-three tournaments.

184
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I guess if you have the whole wireless thing going on.

185
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
So, that'd be fun.

186
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
I like Guilty Gear.

187
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,600
This information, by the way, coming from Famitsu Magazine, who is pretty reputable.

188
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,600
So, this game is coming out for the PSP.

189
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
So, good times.

190
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
Guilty Gear in your pocket.

191
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
What could possibly be better?

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,600
I actually do have the Guilty Gear mini that was on Wonderswan.

193
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Nice.

194
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,600
It's very, very difficult to play that.

195
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,600
In other news, a game I don't care about, Grand Theft Auto IV.

196
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Well, you know how we were chatting about that little rumor about there being a special bundle for PS3?

197
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
It's not a rumor.

198
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:05,600
It's going to be released on April 29th as a 40-gig unit with a six-axis controller and stuff.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,600
And, by the way, this is the European bundle, to be specific.

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,600
It will be 4.39 euro.

201
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,600
So, if you care that much about it, go get it, I guess.

202
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Go get it, I guess.

203
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
Dark Soccer Reviews Games here on Orange Launch Radio.

204
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Go get it, I guess.

205
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
You should let me do more game reviews.

206
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
You should play more games.

207
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
We have a thing at the top of the show.

208
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Well, it's not necessarily that I'm not actually playing them.

209
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,600
It's that other people are using the TV and playing the games.

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,600
You need to regulate and say, bitch, I own half.

211
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,600
That's why they sell, you know, monitor adapters and stuff like that.

212
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
I play on my computer monitor.

213
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I don't even have a good monitor.

214
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
You know what, I have that little Disney.

215
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,600
You know what, I have this Disney princesses TV I never got a chance to use that I got for my birthday.

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
You want to take that and hook something up to it?

217
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Okay.

218
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Look, Dan's TV.

219
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,600
The sad thing is, I think she's serious.

220
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Well, let's see what happens.

221
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I'm all for more Dark Soccer game reviews.

222
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Well, a game I'm sure Jamie would enjoy more than Grand Theft Auto.

223
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
SingStar, not yet released over here, but in Europe.

224
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,600
The SingStar has sold its one million track and that's a lot of karaoke.

225
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:37,600
They have apparently, the SingStar online store has 140,000 registered users and over 20,000 user submitted videos.

226
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,600
None of which are of me because I don't own the game nor will ever own the game.

227
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,600
And have been watched over 2.5 million times.

228
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:54,600
The franchise has also sold 12 million copies over its multiple iterations including SingStar Bollywood.

229
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:04,600
And it's due out over here next month on the 20th, I believe.

230
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Alright.

231
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
So, check that out I guess.

232
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
SingStar, when it comes out over here.

233
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Although, Loki won't be.

234
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I think I'm going to buy it and then get Loki drunk and then see what happens.

235
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
If we can get him on the TV.

236
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
It might be worth it.

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Listeners, let's do a quick poll in chat.

238
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Quick poll, here we go.

239
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Answer the question Y or N.

240
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,600
Is it worth the $600 investment for a Playstation 3 simply to upload Loki drunk karaoke to the interwebs?

241
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
You'd also have to buy a Playstation I.

242
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Alright, is it worth the $650 adjustment or whatever?

243
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Let's throw in booze.

244
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Is it worth the $700 investment?

245
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm not going to do that.

246
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Answer the question.

247
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Let's see, oh, we have some answers coming in already.

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Let's see, we have Y, Y, N from cheeseburger.

249
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:07,600
F and Y, so Y, hell fucking Y, Y, Y, well Y, Y, Y, Y, lowercase Y, I think.

250
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
And then we have Dora the Explorer TV is greater than Disney Princess TV.

251
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
That wasn't the question.

252
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
Alright.

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
There you go, almost 100%.

254
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
Everyone except cheeseburger.

255
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Well cheeseburger, you can just sit that night out.

256
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You can go sit in the corner.

257
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
I say N.

258
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Alright, why?

259
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Because I already have one.

260
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Alright, oh, there we go.

261
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Even better, we'll just bring yours over.

262
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
And then all we have to do is buy Sing Star in a can.

263
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
I want Sing Star.

264
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Loki don't glare at me.

265
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
I do want Sing Star.

266
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I know, it'll be fun.

267
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I played it at E3.

268
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
It'll be fun.

269
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
And I sang, what's that Motorhead song?

270
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Ace of Spades.

271
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
With some guy.

272
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Oh, here's what we'll do is I'll sing, but I'll make you turn around and I'll just say I'm David Cook.

273
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
And then you'll get all excited.

274
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Anyhow, by the way guys, Jamie is hella into American Idol this year.

275
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
It's hilarious.

276
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,600
I...

277
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
It's not funny.

278
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
No, it's hilarious.

279
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
It's great.

280
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Why is it funny?

281
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
Well they got rid of that bitch.

282
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Because it's cute.

283
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
They got rid of that bitch Carly though.

284
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
I like her.

285
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Alright, shut up right now.

286
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Shut up right now.

287
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Video game podcast.

288
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
First of all, did you listen to her old shit?

289
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,600
She sings so much better now than she did five years ago.

290
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Too bad.

291
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
I apologize.

292
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
On top of that, they said that she'd had the best performance ever.

293
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,600
It's just a stupid fucking popularity contest, but David Cook is still going to win.

294
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
That is true.

295
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
That is because he's freaking awesome.

296
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
That's it.

297
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm changing my cage match song.

298
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
I'll give you a dollar.

299
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Alright, fine.

300
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
He's great.

301
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
You know what?

302
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
They can all kiss my ass.

303
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
We have games to talk about.

304
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
It's my turn.

305
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Is it?

306
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Oh.

307
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Is it?

308
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
No.

309
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
We have an international story.

310
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
We do.

311
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,600
We have an international story straight out of Singapore.

312
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
They can't somebody.

313
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
No, they did not cane somebody, but I don't know.

314
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
They may have some type of crazy outbreak here.

315
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Here's the thing.

316
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
There's a brand new rating system that has been announced in Singapore.

317
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
You know, rating systems are overall a good thing as long as people are educated on them,

318
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,600
but here's the kind of weak point about it.

319
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,600
People Like Us has identified a problem with the rating system.

320
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
People Like Us, by the way, is a Singapore gay and lesbian group focused on advocacy

321
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
and public education.

322
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Here's the thing.

323
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,600
If a game contains homosexuality, it is instantly an adult theme rating just because you might

324
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
have some hot girl on girl action like you have in Mass Effect.

325
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Here's a quote from People Like Us.

326
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
People Like Us considers this new rule unjustifiably strict.

327
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Children should not have to be kept ignorant about the presence of gay people in society

328
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
any more than they should be shielded from people of other faiths and ethnicities.

329
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
The path to acceptance of gay people is through teaching children and diversity from a young

330
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
age.

331
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,600
It is pejorative to love gay sexual orientation with crime and drug use, as the MDA's new

332
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,600
guidelines do, as if gay orientation is some kind of social threat.

333
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Now, I think it goes without saying that obviously it's kind of stupid because this is the

334
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,600
equivalent of Brokeback Mountain is automatically an NC-17 rated movie because, you know, oh

335
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
my God, butt sex, right?

336
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
So, here's the thing.

337
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
But it's hot.

338
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,600
Here's the thing is that, okay, the even kind of bigger issue here is that, like, are there

339
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
really that many games that this is going to affect?

340
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
I mean, don't get me wrong.

341
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I totally agree.

342
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,600
It's stupid that this would be, you know, cause a game to get an adults only rating.

343
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,600
But are there really that many games that are going to fall into this category?

344
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
I mean, how many gay characters in games do we have?

345
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
Sadly, not a lot.

346
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,600
And I'm not saying that, shut up, I'm not saying that we suddenly have to get all these

347
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,600
games to come out that have OMG, a token gay in them, or, you know, a gay lead character.

348
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,600
But I think it would be nice if, like, you know, in an RPG or something, and I'm not

349
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,600
talking about Enchanted Arms and that Makoto guy, okay, I'm not even talking about that.

350
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm talking about, I think it would be great to just see a character who just happens to

351
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,600
be gay, and it's no big D. You know, it's just, okay, whatever, cool, right?

352
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,600
Cause I think the nice thing about the youth of America, and, you know, I would say the

353
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,600
youth of the world in general, and most of the countries probably listen to our show

354
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,600
anyway, is that most people kind of have that attitude.

355
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,600
I think most young people know at least one gay or lesbian person in their real life.

356
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
I mean, you know one on the internet, hello.

357
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Who?

358
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Huh?

359
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Where?

360
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
You know one on the internet, but I'm saying, like, at least in their personal lives.

361
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
You know, I'm just saying, I think most people are just like, whatever, it's no big deal

362
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,600
in this day and age anymore.

363
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
It's just, people are different.

364
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,600
And I would like to see that same attitude in games, but I know there's some people that

365
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
have that archaic attitude of, ew, ew, it's too gay, ew, ew.

366
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Well, you know, then don't put it in Grand Theft Auto, but there's plenty of, you know,

367
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,600
other games that would be just fine with it.

368
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
This guy's voiced the game.

369
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
No.

370
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Uh, Saig in chat says, it's not about existing games, but it's the reason that sexuality

371
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
themes are limited because of rating systems would overreact.

372
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,600
You know, and that's kind of true too, is that how often is sexuality even a factor

373
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
in games?

374
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Violence?

375
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Hell yeah, everywhere.

376
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Cursing even starts to see more and more.

377
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Sexuality?

378
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Not so much.

379
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Because OMG Boobs gets you an instant, you know, auto, you know, MC, MA, AO, rating.

380
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
So.

381
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Uh.

382
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
These people are sad.

383
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
It's just silly.

384
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,600
I would do the FUs of the Week right here, but it's just, I don't know.

385
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,600
I mean, I, sadly it's not surprising, but I think the bigger issue is there's not a

386
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,600
lot of games that are going to fall into this category.

387
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Why don't we work on that first?

388
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
So.

389
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
That's it.

390
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
Now we can move on to your story, Jamie.

391
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Now it's time.

392
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Okay.

393
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:03,600
The beta for Battlefield Heroes is going to be in May.

394
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
That's it?

395
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
What the hell is Battlefield Heroes?

396
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I've never even heard of this game.

397
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
It's on the 6th.

398
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,600
It's a free-to-play cartoon sort of version of an online shooting series.

399
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,600
The ads, it's actually funded by ads, but it's not in-game, it's on the website.

400
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Oh, so it's like a PC game?

401
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Yeah.

402
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Because I hear cartoon, I think of Wii.

403
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
But I think that I had seen a little bit of it and it looks like it might be a little

404
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
bit fun.

405
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,600
So, I thought that, you know, especially anything that's free, I thought that people would

406
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
be into it.

407
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
So, May 6th.

408
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Beta.

409
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
All right.

410
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Hey, I like beta and I like free games even more.

411
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Betamax.

412
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Another EA game that's getting a, well not really a beta, but a demo.

413
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
A VHS?

414
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
No, not a VHS.

415
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Laserdisc?

416
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
No.

417
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
A DVD?

418
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,600
Spore.

419
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,600
They're getting the Spore creature creator and demo.

420
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Those are both coming June 17th.

421
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:11,600
The Spore creature creator is actually supposedly part of the, I believe there's like a SimCity

422
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
pack or Sims pack coming out.

423
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,600
That'll be a part of that as well as, well if you don't want to purchase it as part of

424
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
that, you can also get the, I guess, demo for $9.99.

425
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,600
And what the creature creator will allow you to do is create, you know, creatures obviously.

426
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,600
You can export those creatures to wallpapers and stuff like that.

427
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
So, plus I guess the creatures can be used in the full game when that actually finally

428
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
comes out.

429
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
You know what's kind of sad?

430
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,600
I like forgot about Spore.

431
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Remember I was so hyped about this game after we saw that one demo at E3 in like, what,

432
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
2005?

433
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I was like so hyped up for Spore, right?

434
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I kind of forgot about Spore.

435
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,600
They might as well just rename this game Spore Chinese Democracy.

436
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
It's the next PC game I'm going to buy.

437
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,600
I mean, because I don't really, well the last game I bought, and I didn't really technically

438
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,600
buy it because I got it for free, was Crysis.

439
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
It came with my graphics card.

440
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
What about Wrath of the, well I know you're not a Warcraft player.

441
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I'll probably buy Wrath of the Lich game for this.

442
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Fuck the Warcraft shit.

443
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Eh, whatever.

444
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Teach their own.

445
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
No, I'm excited about Spore.

446
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
I just kind of, sadly I forgot it was out there because the game, like, doesn't seem

447
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,600
to ever be coming.

448
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,600
So I don't know, I guess maybe this is a good sign that it'll be on its way.

449
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Will you check out just the creature creator?

450
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Or are you just going to be like, screw it?

451
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Uh, I think I'm just going to be like, screw it.

452
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
I don't want to spoil it.

453
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Are there any PC games you're excited about, Dark Sakura?

454
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
Ragnarok 2, maybe.

455
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
So your games have to come from Korea.

456
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Yeah, Korea.

457
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Alright.

458
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I wouldn't mind having an updated Sonic R.

459
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Um, Rock Band is a game we all own and love and play on the internet.

460
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
I was actually playing a little bit of Rock Band this week.

461
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I was playing with our webmaster VX JasonXV and Rychan.

462
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
I was playing with them, and sadly, Xbox, well,

463
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,600
Xbox was kind of having sporadic connection issues.

464
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Our game got dumped, and then like, I left to go get dinner,

465
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
and then I totally got sidetracked and didn't come back until like hours later.

466
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
I felt kind of bad, but you know, it's just a video game.

467
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,600
But Rock Band's fun to play online.

468
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I need to go on and play with some listeners at some point,

469
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
even though now they're all on Mario Kart Wii.

470
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,600
But Rock Band has some new songs coming out, as they do every week.

471
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,600
Two of the songs this week come from the same band,

472
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
The Mother Hips, which are from Chico, California.

473
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I know that because I used to live there,

474
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,600
so I think it's kind of funny that now they're having all this success through a video game.

475
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,600
But there you have Red Tandy and Time Six Son of a Grizzly Bear from The Mother Hips.

476
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I wonder if they still play at Brickworks, I don't know.

477
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,600
But that is coming at some point to Rock Band.

478
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
That would be next Tuesday, actually.

479
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,600
But the Smashing Pumpkins, you know them, they have a song already in the game.

480
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,600
They have what, Cherub Rock is in the game.

481
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,600
And now you can download Zero, which has some pretty awesome guitar.

482
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Remember that song, Zero?

483
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Although, props to you if you can sing like Billy Corgan.

484
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
No.

485
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Because he's got something going on.

486
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,600
I'm sad when a man can sing higher than me.

487
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Billy Corgan is sadly not David Cook, is he?

488
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
No.

489
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
All right.

490
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
Let's get to the mailbag.

491
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Every week we encourage you guys to send us some e-mails.

492
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it.

493
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Dark Sakura will dive into the e-mailbag every week,

494
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
but she wears plastic gloves when she does it because she doesn't want anthrax poisoning.

495
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,600
Anthrax was an 80s band, not a poison.

496
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
Anthrax is great.

497
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
All right.

498
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
So here it is, our mailbag segment.

499
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Dark Sakura, read some e-mails.

500
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Crap, crap, crap, crap done.

501
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
No, I'm kidding.

502
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
We just got a lot of crap this week.

503
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,600
No, although some underage girl wanted to show me her private pictures.

504
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Oh, damn that spam.

505
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
I know.

506
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
That's supposed to be coming to me.

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
No, I'm not going to say it.

508
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Anyway, hi guys.

509
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,600
On the show before last Rob said Live 365 idiots charged him after he sent two e-mails saying he quit.

510
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
He said he would give us an update on it last week and never did.

511
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
So my question is, what's going on with that?

512
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Also I have been listening since episode 150 and I still don't know why Loki hates Tingle.

513
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
P.S. I attached a picture.

514
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I was bored.

515
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Misspelled.

516
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Who's it from?

517
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Oh, it's a little picture of Tingle with Loki's face on it and it says Loki.

518
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
How wonderful.

519
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
All right.

520
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,600
And that's from I Can Ask Cheeseburger.

521
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
I Can Ask Cheeseburger.

522
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Thank you.

523
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I did forget to give the Live 365 update because it's kind of funny what happened.

524
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
You might remember I was really pissed because they charged my credit card

525
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,600
and it was a little unfair of me to not give the follow up.

526
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
So I apologize to them.

527
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,600
But strangely enough that next Monday mysteriously with no e-mail.

528
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Well, no, I did get an e-mail.

529
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I got a little e-mail in my inbox that says,

530
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Rob, we have processed the cancellation and they refunded my credit card the entire money.

531
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Sweet.

532
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
So they did not end up stealing the money for me.

533
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
It was only out of my bank account for a couple of days.

534
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
They borrowed it for a couple of days.

535
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
They borrowed it for a couple of days.

536
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
They poked it and did experiments.

537
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,600
But the strange thing is we got like a little bit of kickback from our VIP listenership.

538
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
The more VIPs that we had listening to us in Live 365, we got some kickback.

539
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
But honestly, guys, it was nothing.

540
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,600
I think we got like $1.37 from the month of March.

541
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
So I actually got refunded that $1.37 back as well.

542
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
So I actually did get a little bit of interest, I guess you could say,

543
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,600
thanks to our VIP listeners who I do feel bad for that we're not on Live 365 anymore.

544
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
But all games is where it's at, yo.

545
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
It's where it's at.

546
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
Get in.

547
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Live in the now.

548
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,600
Also, Sauce says that Poison was also an 80s band, Rob.

549
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
That is true.

550
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Anthrax is Poison and Poison was also an 80s band.

551
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
That's crazy.

552
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Darktitsuiya said the exact same thing in chat.

553
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Great minds think alike.

554
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
That's kind of freaky.

555
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,600
I like what my husband says.

556
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Great minds think like us.

557
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Loki, describe your hatred of Tingle.

558
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,600
Why is it you hate Tingle so damn much?

559
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I think he's a stupid character, that's all.

560
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
He was annoying.

561
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
He was annoying in Wind Waker.

562
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
This fascination with everybody for me to do Tingle's voice, I don't know.

563
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
It's just retarded.

564
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
I think you actually did it one night and that's what was funny.

565
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
I did it one night, yes.

566
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
And that was the biggest mistake you ever made.

567
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
There you go.

568
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Because people don't know when to let a joke go.

569
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
All right.

570
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
That joke has been going on forever.

571
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Anyway.

572
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,600
All right, moving on.

573
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,600
This email is from someone in Australia, I believe.

574
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
So.

575
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Crikey.

576
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Hi.

577
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,600
I've been listening for the past six months on podcasts and have been enjoying it.

578
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,600
It breaks up the ride to and from work, so I'm not bored just looking at the window,

579
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
seeing the same thing every day.

580
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
I can't listen live as it's in the middle of Monday and I'm at work.

581
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Only have been live once.

582
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
The changeover to all games has been good.

583
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I've noticed the upgrade in audio from the first second.

584
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Glad to see you've left dead 365.

585
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,600
I actually do want to point out the change in audio has nothing to do with our all games move.

586
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
The live change in audio, yes.

587
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,600
The podcast change in audio was just a decision that we just did.

588
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,600
We went through it and that is that we used to be encoded in 56K stereo.

589
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
But honestly, how much music have we been playing on the show?

590
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Not a lot.

591
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
So we downgraded.

592
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,600
We actually downgraded to mono, but we went to 64K mono.

593
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,600
There's a lot of difference there in the sound quality, so it sounds really good.

594
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I've been playing Mario Kart Wii quite a bit over the past few months,

595
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
and I found out something that Rob won't like too much.

596
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Sorry to tell you, Rob, but Toadette is an unlockable character on Mario Kart Wii.

597
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,600
God damn it!

598
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Thanks for everything and keep up the good work.

599
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Long live the ferret.

600
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,600
That's the one I was trying to get to.

601
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,600
King Mill is also sponsored by the Olive Garden.

602
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Unfortunately, no never-ending breadsticks here in Australia.

603
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
What?

604
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Thanks is from Michael.

605
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Bobby Blackwolf's in chat, our old buddy who errors an hour before us.

606
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
He is actually taking credit for the sound upgrade.

607
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,600
He says, no, actually, all games is responsible for this change too.

608
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Don't believe Rob.

609
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
We were like, you can't come unless you're in 64K mono.

610
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
It's true.

611
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Rob.

612
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
What?

613
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Rob.

614
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
What?

615
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,600
On May 1st, let's go to Olive Garden.

616
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
I can't.

617
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
I'm still on the low-fat diet until at least...

618
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
You can get low-fat?

619
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Really?

620
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Yes.

621
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
All right, then we can go on May 1st.

622
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
I will personally look over their menu and pick out the crap that isn't fat.

623
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
You can get a diet menu anywhere.

624
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
That's what I've learned.

625
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I've been in Vegas on May 1st.

626
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,600
All right, here we go with the Food Network again.

627
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
But here's the quick thing.

628
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,600
If the listeners that have been listening for a couple months know that I have issues in my pancreas,

629
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,600
I'm going to pick low-fat diet because of it until at least May 9th.

630
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,600
Here's the thing is that like part of the thing I've learned,

631
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,600
like I went to Ruby Tuesdays this week with some of my coworkers that were visiting from L.A.

632
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,600
and they were getting the spinach dip and the avocado dip and they were like,

633
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
mmm, this is so good.

634
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
I'm so sorry, Rob.

635
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
I'm so sorry you can't eat this.

636
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
So I learned that they have a diet menu.

637
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
You know what I ate at Ruby Tuesdays, nice low-fat?

638
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,600
I ate an unflavored piece of cooked chicken and broccoli.

639
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
That was my dinner.

640
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Whoop-de-hoo.

641
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,600
Well, I think that also part of, I think that, you know, possibly the,

642
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,600
you didn't ask if it's all the fats or if it's just saturated, saturates.

643
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
It's all fat.

644
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
It's any fat.

645
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Oh, man.

646
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I can't have fat.

647
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
I can't have caffeine.

648
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
I can't have carbonation.

649
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,600
You can't digest vitamin E now.

650
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
It's horrible.

651
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
You cannot digest vitamin E.

652
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,600
May 5th marks one month since I got out of the hospital.

653
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,600
But here's the thing, I had Thai food last night in San Francisco

654
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,600
that I thought was going to be healthy for me,

655
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,600
and I think I overindulged a little bit because my chest was hurting last night,

656
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
and that's not a good sign.

657
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
I'm really worried.

658
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
I don't want to have this forever.

659
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
All right, OL Foodio is over.

660
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Let's get back to the e-mail.

661
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Hey, give me a second.

662
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
My eyes hurt.

663
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Orange Lounge Foodio.

664
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Okay.

665
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Hey, OLR.

666
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
First off, a big F-you to Nintendo for giving a mandatory update

667
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
with Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

668
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,600
I permanently have Photo Channel 1.1.

669
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,600
This means I need to make M4A files to listen to music on Photo Channel,

670
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,600
which means I have to delete my MP3 files for one of my favorite racing games,

671
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Excite Truck.

672
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Loki, I love the game as much as you do.

673
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
You are not alone.

674
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Next, would you buy anything with the word strip before the title

675
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
if it were on Xbox Live Arcade?

676
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Yes.

677
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
What if it's strip mine?

678
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
That's what I keep thinking of.

679
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
What if it's, you know, strip racing?

680
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
Or strip paint.

681
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
You know, where you go to the wall and put turpentine and shit.

682
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Third, are you looking forward to any WiiWare games

683
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,600
when the service comes out next week?

684
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,600
I actually like Defend Your Castle way more than I ought to,

685
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,600
so I'll probably buy Defend Your Castle on the Wii

686
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,600
because that game is so much freaking hilarity on the PC,

687
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
and yeah, I know it's been out for years.

688
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
That might be.

689
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm looking forward to seeing the competitive one.

690
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
And yes, I want the strong, bad Wii game.

691
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,600
That's going to be hilarious, but I know that's not out at launch.

692
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
That's what I want. Oh, man.

693
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Let's see.

694
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
The chat room wants to let our e-mailer know.

695
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,600
BlackWolf is saying he can just delete the 1.1 channel,

696
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
and ActDeft is going to post a link in chat.

697
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,600
There is a way you can downgrade the photo channel from 1.1.

698
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,600
You can get rid of that if you want to go back to the old one.

699
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Probably you can Google it since you're not a live listener, it sounds like.

700
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Was this the same guy from Australia?

701
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,600
No, this is Katamari's Forever.

702
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,600
Oh, well, shit, Katamari's Forever I think is in chat right now.

703
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Or did they leave?

704
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
Oh, I think they left.

705
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Well, poor thing because they're about to get a link in chat.

706
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,600
But if they happen to be listening to the podcast,

707
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,600
I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

708
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Shoot us a message. We'll find it.

709
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,600
ActDeft is posting a link from Joystiq,

710
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
you know, the blog with Joystiq with a Q.

711
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,600
It was posted on December 13th of last year if you want to go find it.

712
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Just Google it. Photo channel downgrade, you'll find it.

713
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Lastly, I recently bought Night's Journey of Dreams.

714
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,600
It's a cool and very cute game, but it suffers from simplicity.

715
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,600
However, the voice acting is top notch and it sort of alludes to eternity's child.

716
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,600
I hope to see you at the Olive Garden when the endless pasta deal comes back.

717
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,600
And Night's has always been simplistic in play.

718
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,600
However, having upgraded, you know, better voice acting is really good

719
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,600
because the Saturn version is like, and Claris decided that she was going to go out.

720
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
It's like they took one of their secretaries who just happened to speak English and say,

721
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
here, do this. Okay.

722
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
And yes, it had the same bad voice acting in Japan.

723
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Sadly, that's probably how it happened.

724
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Oh, yeah, I went and done it.

725
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,600
P.S. Where did Dr. Sakura get the ferret?

726
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
I haven't listened for that long and I'd like to know of its origins.

727
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Thanks again.

728
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
It's not my ferret, but I have adopted it as my baby.

729
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I want to say this week on the Wikia, I posted a huge,

730
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
I went to the Wikia to clear up two questions that were being asked of me.

731
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
One of them was the ferret.

732
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,600
No, the ferret article was wrong, so I went and posted a big old thing in the talk section,

733
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
so you can go read that.

734
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,600
And also on the Wikia, how OLR got its name.

735
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Dr. Tetsuya wanted me to post a thing about that, so I posted a big old thing on that,

736
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,600
including why we named it that, and so on and so on.

737
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Oh, my God.

738
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
ActDeft is also pointing a step by step.

739
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,600
He actually went and got a bullet point list of how you downgrade the photo channel.

740
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
So here it is.

741
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,600
From the main menu, go into the Wii manual, go into the Wii button,

742
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,600
select data management, select channels, then select photo channel 1.1.

743
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Confirm you want to delete it.

744
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
Photo channel 1.0 will return.

745
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
There you have it.

746
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Stuff.

747
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
A long email.

748
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Oh, Lord.

749
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Dun, dun, dun.

750
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
From who?

751
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Guess who it's from.

752
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
From who?

753
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
It is from Raw Steel UT.

754
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
He must be listening tonight.

755
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
He must have heard the thing earlier, didn't he?

756
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
I don't know.

757
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,600
All right.

758
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Well, read however much you want to.

759
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Hey, guys.

760
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Hi.

761
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,600
I'm a girl, so you should clarify, too.

762
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,600
Hey, guys and girl.

763
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Hi, baby.

764
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Anyway.

765
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
You really wanted him to start emailing?

766
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Hey, baby.

767
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
No.

768
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I was just being silly.

769
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Rob, the heat in here is giving me a freaking migraine.

770
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Look, you're sitting right by the fan.

771
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
I don't know what to say.

772
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
It doesn't matter.

773
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
I still have a migraine.

774
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
And the box fan is broke.

775
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
All right.

776
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Come on.

777
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Read the email.

778
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
He broke the box.

779
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Just because I can't get on the chat anymore doesn't mean I can't participate.

780
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Dude, unban him, okay?

781
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,600
My official decree is to freaking unban him, so do it.

782
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Oh, snap.

783
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Now.

784
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
All right.

785
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
There you have it.

786
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,600
I'd probably say more things that DMN and other game pirates don't like in these emails,

787
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
but what are they going to do?

788
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Ban me?

789
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Anyway.

790
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Anyway, I wanted to start by talking about light gun games on consoles, particularly

791
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
games that use limited continues.

792
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,600
The problem with console ports of arcade shooters is that, by and large, they're very vanilla

793
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,600
ports without much consideration for the home consoles.

794
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Obviously, you need to get the arcade mode in there, give people the option of free play,

795
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,600
but in order to give a balanced experience that feels like it's not being made to bilk

796
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,600
your ass for quarters, there needs to be a console-specific game mode.

797
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,600
House of the Dead 2 and Vampire Knight had cool little mode where you could find special

798
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:38,600
items that could then be equipped for use in the next playthrough.

799
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,600
That was a cool little beginning, but since we've seen very little progress to making

800
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:51,600
console-specific experiences, however, two games that have been released recently show

801
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
a way for console light gun games to work.

802
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,600
First, we have Time Crisis 4 Complete Mission Mode.

803
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:03,600
In between the FPS stages, players will play through the arcade stages, but there is a

804
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,600
difference in how they work versus the arcade mode.

805
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
The player starts each stage with four units of life regardless of their health at the

806
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
end of the previous stage.

807
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Upon death, the stage starts at the very beginning.

808
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
They can, however, retry as many times as they like.

809
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,600
This makes the game challenging without being a cheap exercise in credit draining.

810
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Another game is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.

811
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
This game has a checkpoint at the center of the stage and at the final boss, and items

812
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,600
found in the game can be used immediately or stored for later use.

813
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,600
One can only hope that more light gun games will provide more robust experiences.

814
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,600
Did he use robust?

815
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Because just the arcade game isn't enough.

816
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Remember, you can't spell robust without Rob.

817
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Or bust.

818
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Like Robobust.

819
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
More email.

820
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
More email!

821
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Fine!

822
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Next, I saw something on Kotaku regarding the obscene amount of time it takes to quit

823
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
the PC versions of Assassin's Creed.

824
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,600
It took a full minute to quit the game using the in-game menus.

825
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Granted, you can control alt-delete and quit that way, but seeing just how asinine

826
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
the in-game quit ordeal is really cast doubt over Ubi's willingness to cater to the PC

827
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,600
crowd, especially with the continued downfall of the PC as a mainstream gaming platform

828
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,600
i.e. retail games and not ad-supported casual stuff.

829
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:34,600
And it's at Kotaku.com slash 384339 slash Assassins dash Creed dash I dash can't dash quit dash U.

830
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I think that's pretty freakin' funny.

831
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Next, I have to talk about the Perfect 10 review IGN gave GTA IV, which was coincidentally

832
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,600
an exclusive first review.

833
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,600
First off, one has to question the ethical integrity of an exclusive review.

834
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,600
We don't hear about exclusive music or movie previews.

835
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
It just doesn't happen.

836
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Why?

837
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Because the music and movie reviews tend to have more integrity than much of the gaming

838
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
enthusiast media.

839
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:14,600
Indeed, I've never seen an exclusive review that wasn't a glowing puff piece for the game

840
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
in question.

841
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,600
And the reviewer in this case made it obvious, with hyperbole like calling it the best game

842
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,600
in a decade and proclaiming it to be perfect.

843
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,600
I can imagine the guy writing the review on his knees while his mouth was otherwise occupied.

844
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Considering Loki's criticism of the soundtrack, Jamie's complete disinterest in the boring

845
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:40,600
monotony, and both Loki and Rob saying that the cheats are what make GTA fun, it really

846
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,600
looks like Rockstar is buying reviews, or at least like many reviewers are mystified

847
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:50,600
by the uber popular franchise and not wanting to believe they're even the slightest thing

848
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
wrong with it.

849
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
You know what, I just want to jump in here.

850
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I actually really agree with what he's saying here, because I think it is absolute bullshit

851
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,600
that IGN gets this exclusive review, and coincidentally it gets a 10 out of 10.

852
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Now, I think we all knew Grand Theft Auto was going to get stellar reviews across the

853
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,600
board, but quite frankly, IGN's word is tarnished, period, from this.

854
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,600
If you get an exclusive review from a company and all this stuff, of course you're going

855
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
to say good things about it.

856
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
You know what I mean?

857
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
Well, and I wouldn't really say that it's exclusive.

858
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,600
I mean, a lot of people shared the 10 out of 10, and to be honest, I think the official

859
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Xbox magazine had a 10 out of 10 review way before this, but I don't know.

860
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,600
The whole rating system is kind of skewed anyways, and really what you need to do is

861
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,600
just ignore the ratings and just read what they write, because they'll explain in the

862
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,600
review that it's not perfect and that there's issues and stuff, and that's really what you

863
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
need to take.

864
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
You don't buy your game based off of a number review.

865
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:53,600
It's just like if you scored a B on a test or something, well, what's more important,

866
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
the fact that you scored a B or why you scored a B on the test?

867
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I mean, that's what's more important, I would think, to an individual.

868
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,600
And the other thing, too, is a lot of people are skewed.

869
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,600
I mean, there's a lot of Grand Theft Auto fanboys out there, and I'll be first to say

870
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:15,600
I love the game, and I absolutely think it's not perfect, but it's, I mean, what do you

871
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
expect?

872
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:23,600
It's basically as much of a jump from Grand Theft Auto 3 to 4 as it was from 2 to 3, and

873
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
that was pretty big, so it's great.

874
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
It's what it needs to go, but you know what?

875
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,600
When they do come out with the next Vice City or whatever that is using the same engine,

876
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,600
it's going to be that much better, so I don't know.

877
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
But yeah, exclusive of anything is retarded.

878
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Well, there was more to that paragraph.

879
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,600
The lack of balls in mainstream gaming media is frighteningly familiar to anyone who remembers

880
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,600
the gaming industry crash of 1983, when people started buying video games in general because

881
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,600
even shitty games were getting glowing reviews.

882
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Hopefully the growth of independent media such as All Games Radio will stem the tide

883
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,600
of consumer distrust before the industry explodes.

884
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Lastly, while the Nintendo Wii is still selling like crazy, attach rates are still lower than

885
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,600
either other console, and third parties are increasingly looking at the Wii as nothing

886
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,600
more than a disposable toy.

887
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,600
GameStop can't keep Wiis in stock, but have huge piles of accessories, and the only consistent

888
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
sellers are Wii Play and Nintendo mascot games.

889
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Nintendo can make all the money they want, but they've not achieved their alleged goal

890
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,600
of increasing the market.

891
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,600
Some gamers still aren't buying games, and the gamers who aren't Nintendo fanboys are

892
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,600
increasingly dissatisfied with the system, yours truly while still UT.

893
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,600
This letter brought to you by Taco Bell, home of the never-ending diarrhea.

894
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,600
I do agree that they haven't really expanded much beyond, because they were trying to get

895
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,600
out of the whole rut that the GameCube is just a game for kids.

896
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,600
Well, the fact that they're releasing kid games all across, and I...

897
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:04,600
Okay, so they released Metroid Prime 3, but big deal, one game out of, you know, I don't

898
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,600
know how many they've made, that doesn't really count.

899
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,600
And yeah, they are targeting, you know, the casual player and stuff with these, you know,

900
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,600
like Wii Fit, and, you know, just the Wii console, and Wii Sports and everything, and

901
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,600
so yeah, there's a lot of people that will buy it just for Wii Sports, and that's it.

902
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,600
And they've sold, you know, they've profited from that maybe about ten bucks, you know,

903
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,600
because they're probably making some money off each console, but that's it.

904
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,600
And you know, then they're getting people to buy accessories and stuff, and there's,

905
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:36,600
you know, a lot of markup there too, so it's just retarded.

906
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,600
I think it's important to remember, not that I'm trying to make excuses for the Wii, because

907
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,600
the Wii certainly has its shortcomings, you know, especially as we've kind of moved on

908
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,600
a year past its launch and so on, or almost two years getting there, is that the Wii doesn't

909
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,600
lose money with every sale, whereas PlayStation 3 loses quite a bit of money, and Xbox 360

910
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,600
I think now about breaks even, but when it was first out it was losing money too, so

911
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,600
they have to sell more games to kind of make a profit, but Nintendo Wii, they're profiting

912
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,600
right out the gate, so kind of like Logie says, you just buy it for Wii Sports, there's

913
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,600
still a profit to be made, but I think as long as Nintendo puts out those, you know,

914
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,600
one, two games a year that you just have to freaking have, the soccer moms, and I think

915
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Wii Fit is this year's, it's still going to be a big deal.

916
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:26,600
So, you know, but again, it's just a different audience than the hardcore gamer, so if Nintendo

917
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,600
wants to appeal to the hardcore gamer, I guess we get Metroid Prime 3, Mario Kart's not bad,

918
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
you know, there's some of those games.

919
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,600
I just don't think, but here's my problem with Nintendo is I don't think they get the

920
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:45,600
market still, even though they may, you know, they're in theory tapping parts of the market

921
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,600
that, you know, haven't been tapped before, like the casual gamer and stuff, maybe you

922
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,600
shouldn't be tapping that market because it's not profitable for you, you're selling tons

923
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,600
of consoles, but these people aren't buying, you know, games.

924
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,600
It's also the same problem with Sony, you're selling a Playstation 3 as a Blu-ray player,

925
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,600
well these people may not buy games either, so now you're losing money on that sale, but

926
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,600
you're not necessarily making it up in Blu-ray sales.

927
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Keep in mind also Nintendo is a Japanese company, Microsoft is an American company, and while

928
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,600
yes, Sony is a Japanese company as well, you kind of get the feeling that there's a little

929
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,600
bit of tug-of-war going on between their American and Japanese arms as to, you know, who's controlling

930
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,600
the Playstation 3, you know what I mean?

931
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:30,600
So, it's something else to consider as well, because definitely you have a vastly different

932
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,600
audience when you talk about the Japanese gaming audience, and the American gaming audience

933
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,600
just look at any top 10 chart from a week, and there you have it.

934
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,600
And I mean, the same I guess could be said for the DS, because the Nintendo-made games

935
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,600
tend to sell very well, and there are, it's starting to come around for third-party stuff,

936
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,600
and I think it's going to come around eventually for the Wii as well, because I mean the Wii's

937
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:56,600
only been out for, you know, not that long, so, I mean, sure there's a ton of crappy ports,

938
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:01,600
just like there was a ton of crappy Xbox ports for the Xbox 360 when it first came out, and

939
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,600
there was a ton of crappy Playstation 1 ports for, you know, the Playstation 2 when it first came out.

940
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,600
But it's that Fantavision. Fantavision was fun, I liked Fantavision.

941
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:19,600
I don't know. But, you know, stuff will get better, and people, unfortunately, you know,

942
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,600
people understand that there are shovelware games out there, and you know what, the best

943
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,600
thing you can do is just not buy them, you know, granted there are stupid people that

944
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
will buy them, but that's fine, that's who they're catered to.

945
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
There will always be the Walmart crowd that buys them because they're cheap.

946
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Exactly, but that's fine, those companies are there, you know, it's pretty funny though,

947
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,600
because we had some of the publishers out, and there were some publishers that deal in

948
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,600
specifically, you know, I want to say it was Destiny, but I'm not sure, but they're a

949
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,600
company that dealt with, like, really small games that, you know, didn't really do that

950
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:54,600
well, and they understand where their market is, they understand that they're not trying

951
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,600
to compete with, like, Grand Theft Auto, they're competing, you know, they're basically

952
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,600
just putting them out there because they sell, and that's it.

953
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,600
So, you know, they understand that their games aren't that quality, but they accept them

954
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,600
for what they are, so it's just people that are dumbing to buy them.

955
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Alright, let's move on, that was the end of the email, are there any more emails?

956
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,600
No, no, no, there were two more.

957
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Okay.

958
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Hey, OLR, Hope Sky and the Fair are okay, I just thought I'd say, since I started to

959
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,600
listen to OLR episode 245, the show has changed so much, and you can use Studio and the

960
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,600
All Games move, OLR just getting bigger and better, congrats.

961
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:39,600
I should be live for once as I live in the UK, so keep an eye out, as it won't happen

962
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,600
again for a while, and that's from Lichen, that's in the chat room right now.

963
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,600
They are in chat, awesome.

964
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Last email!

965
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,600
I just wanted to say, that person did kind of put it into perspective, there has been

966
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,600
a lot of changes to the show just in the past year, so it's pretty exciting.

967
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,600
Soon the world.

968
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,600
Last email.

969
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
Dun dun dun.

970
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,600
Hi, OLR, I have been really bored because I forced myself to stop Crysis.

971
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,600
I've been playing other games right now, like Ragnarok 2, but I think it hates Vista,

972
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:16,600
what doesn't, so it gives me a BSOD, to translate a blue screen of death.

973
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:21,600
I have a bit of money, so I want a PS2 game for my new PS2, and I recommend games for

974
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
an RPG fan, not Kingdom Hearts, period.

975
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,600
I already own Kingdom Hearts 1, Ace Combat 5, Tony Hawk's Project 8, Game of Pure Fail.

976
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:35,600
Some PC games would do, but it can be a shooter, no Valve games, I'd rather RPGs.

977
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,600
Honestly, Kingdom Hearts 2 is much better than Kingdom Hearts 1, but if you want RPG,

978
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,600
give Final Fantasy X or X-2, I mean those were fairly solid.

979
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Those were good.

980
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,600
12 was great.

981
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,600
I played 12 and I did not like the battle system at all.

982
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,600
There's people up and down screaming, you gotta get Persona 3.

983
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
Yeah, Persona 3.

984
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Disgaea, if you like tactical games.

985
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
I'm trying to think of what the new...

986
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,600
It's not really an RPG, but the Fatal Frame games were getting some...

987
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,600
have a little bit of a fan falling behind them too.

988
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:19,600
This is from SakuraiMax, dragging misery into my life.

989
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,600
I hope all the idiots who exist in my life would just go away.

990
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,600
Okay, I'm not going to read the rest of that, that's emo.

991
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
PS, Drip Lounge Radio.

992
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,600
PSS Orange Lounge Radio, it's better than Crysis.

993
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,600
Indeed, it is better than Crysis.

994
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,600
Now we're done with emails.

995
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,600
Yar.

996
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Oh, I got one more mention from Royal Steel UT.

997
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,600
Oh, how long is it?

998
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
Not long.

999
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Alright, hurry.

1000
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Sorry guys, but with my banning from chat, I can't respond fast to the topics I like.

1001
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
Just some quick things though.

1002
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,600
In the US, fansubbing is still illegal as it violates the original rights holders.

1003
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,600
In this case, Japanese anime makers.

1004
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,600
Companies like Media Factory Incorporated have sent cease and desist orders to torrent sites carrying fansubs of their anime.

1005
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,600
And we've seen an increase in recent years of pre-licensed anime such as Ghost of the Shell Standalone Complex.

1006
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,600
In some cases even funded in part by US companies like ADV and Manga Entertainment.

1007
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:22,600
Japanese companies are obviously discontent with fansubbers as they devalue a license and are also available for Japanese users.

1008
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,600
The internet being what it is.

1009
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:32,600
JSRAC is a company formed by such anime companies and have frequently had problems with YouTube over the fansub content of their service.

1010
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:37,600
As for the sequel to Rival Schools, while it is still called Project Justice Rival Schools 2 in Latin American Europe,

1011
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,600
the subtitle Rival Schools 2 was removed from the American A.I. I knew that.

1012
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,600
Presumably not to cause controversy two years after the Columbine Massacre in Japan, it was referred to as Moru Justice Gakuen, which is what I said.

1013
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,600
And that's the name I still mostly refer to it by because I had the Japanese version for a long, long time.

1014
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
So yeah.

1015
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,600
Done!

1016
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,600
If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1017
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Meanwhile, more gaming news!

1018
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Yes. There's going to be a brand new game. Actually, this looks pretty awesome. I've got one on order for myself and I'm not really into racing games.

1019
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:19,600
But, Grid, the brand new game from Codemasters. You may remember them doing Dirt, which is a pretty well accepted game.

1020
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,600
This time, you know, it's going to be all street racing and, well, street circuits and that kind of stuff.

1021
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,600
It is pretty cool though. They're going to have integration with eBay Motors.

1022
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,600
So you can actually, I guess, sell vehicles that you have created in-game through eBay.

1023
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,600
I don't know how that's actually going to work though if you're going to have to pay real money for it.

1024
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:47,600
It says, well, it's going to allow players to buy and sell in-game vehicles in a realistic setting.

1025
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:55,600
And it says also they're going to have different eBay sponsor races like the eBay Motor Muscle Series.

1026
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:04,600
They're going to have, let's see, some other concept cars and stuff like that with eBay stuff plastered all over it.

1027
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,600
It doesn't really say though that they're going to be using real money.

1028
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,600
So I'm not sure if it's just using eBay with some fictional money or what's going on there.

1029
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:19,600
God, I hope it's not real eBay. As if there wasn't enough shit on eBay. Really.

1030
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,600
You could actually probably buy shit on eBay.

1031
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,600
I could find out.

1032
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:30,600
No, it's probably against their terms of service, but that doesn't mean there isn't one for sale that's waiting to get taken down.

1033
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,600
I mean, once in a while I'll go on eBay and search for souls, people selling their soul on eBay.

1034
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,600
And there's usually a couple to be found even though you can't sell those.

1035
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,600
All right, moving on to something.

1036
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:47,600
I guess the ticket redemption industry probably sold their soul to the devil to chew real arcade games out of arcades.

1037
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,600
But I thought this was kind of interesting.

1038
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:58,600
There is a new bill in South Carolina that Representative Todd Rutherford has brought to light that deals with ticket redemption games and illegal gambling.

1039
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,600
But it's not what you think. Here's the thing.

1040
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,600
The sponsor of the bill, he calls it the Chuck E. Cheese bill.

1041
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:11,600
And what it is is that right now a game like skeeball or a type of video game, it might violate the law.

1042
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:18,600
However, what he wants to do is he actually wants to clearly state that these games do not violate the gambling law, that they're okay.

1043
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:27,600
So it's actually, you know, usually when we talk about, you know, game related bills going into effect, we're talking about some type of extreme ass hattery.

1044
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,600
But in this case, I guess it makes sense.

1045
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,600
You know, it's just kids messing around. They don't want to consider it gambling.

1046
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:40,600
They don't expect any opposition because, you know, the bill is simply saying that children's games at Chuck E. Cheese are not illegal.

1047
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:48,600
That doesn't change the fact, though, that, you know, these games at Chuck E. Cheese is one thing.

1048
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,600
But these games, having taken over my favorite arcades of yesteryear, are another.

1049
00:53:53,600 --> 00:54:02,600
And it kind of ticks me off. I don't know about you guys, but I'm a little bit pissed off that ticket redemption games have overtaken arcades I used to know and love and shed other ones out of business.

1050
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,600
And hence, that's why I think it's time to do the FUs of the week.

1051
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:27,600
My FU is to these stupid people.

1052
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:38,600
And I know I always do talk about, you know, traffic and stupid people driving, but this couple in a big mini, it's not really mini.

1053
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
It's just a van.

1054
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,600
We're turning around where you cannot do a U-turn and so turned into the next street and did a wide loop.

1055
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,600
So I was like, fuck you, you have to wait since they're technically in a right hand turning lane now.

1056
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,600
And I went and honked at them quite loudly. Stupid bitch.

1057
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,600
And also FU to the heat.

1058
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,600
I mean, it's not very hot right now and it was really nice outside, but the sun specifically.

1059
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
FU, sun!

1060
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:09,600
You need to get a really big rock and throw it at the sun.

1061
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,600
Little bit of tan.

1062
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,600
Or a burn. Loki.

1063
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:19,600
I don't have any FUs this week.

1064
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,600
I guess.

1065
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:28,600
Okay, I got one. FU to Burger King for coming out with the Deluxe Steakhouse Burger.

1066
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:34,600
Because I understand as cool of an idea as it sounds like on paper, it really is not a very good burger.

1067
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,600
I mean, it's got, what, you know, steak, like onions.

1068
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:45,600
But where they go wrong with it is that it has mashed potatoes on the burger.

1069
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,600
You should do that in elementary school.

1070
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
That sounds nasty.

1071
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,600
If you tried it, it wasn't very good.

1072
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,600
But the Steakhouse Burger itself was good. Just don't go Deluxe.

1073
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,600
Or if you do, minus mashed potatoes.

1074
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,600
It sounds more like a Shepherd's Pie Burger.

1075
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Because potatoes are good on a Shepherd's Pie, but I wouldn't...

1076
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,600
They do that with their breakfast burgers. They have one with hash browns on it.

1077
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,600
Which hash browns aren't so bad because it's got that crunchy outside to it.

1078
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,600
But mashed potatoes, it's just weird.

1079
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,600
It's not... no.

1080
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,600
I need to put my french fries on my hamburger.

1081
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,600
You cannot take a meal, put it between buns, and call it a fucking burger.

1082
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,600
It just doesn't work.

1083
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,600
If you've got this beef in there, you can.

1084
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Misty, by the way, is in chat, and she's a BK expert of sorts.

1085
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
She says, I agree with that.

1086
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:34,600
Hey, I like the potatoes. It's the meat that's fucking nasty.

1087
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,600
No, the meat's not bad.

1088
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Try McDonald's. That shit's horrible.

1089
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,600
Here we go again with Orange Lounge Foodio.

1090
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,600
My FU of the Week goes to my pancreas, again, for giving me problems the past few days.

1091
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Specifically the cysts that I believe burst on my pancreas.

1092
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,600
Ew, I know.

1093
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,600
But think how it feels.

1094
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Just a couple days ago, which caused me to have a lot of pain.

1095
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,600
And I'm still in pain today. It feels like there's a hole in my pancreas.

1096
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
It hurts. I hate it.

1097
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,600
And FU'd a drama in general.

1098
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,600
I'm not talking about any chat room drama that's going on or whatever.

1099
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,600
I'm talking about drama in my personal life because I had a lot of drama.

1100
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,600
I had epic drama yesterday.

1101
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,600
Epic with a capital E-P-I-C. All caps. Epic drama yesterday.

1102
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,600
It was great.

1103
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
And by great, I mean shitty.

1104
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,600
All right.

1105
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,600
There you have it, Chair of FUs of the Week.

1106
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,600
Let's get back to some gaming news.

1107
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,600
Yes, we must.

1108
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,600
Okay. Guess what?

1109
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,600
Arby's bought out Wendy's for real?

1110
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,600
They did?

1111
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,600
How did Arby's buy-

1112
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,600
Here we go back to Orange on Radio Fudio.

1113
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
Arby's bought Wendy's.

1114
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Wouldn't it be the other way around? I thought Wendy's was number three.

1115
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Shouldn't Wendy's buy Arby's?

1116
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,600
Arby's is nastified.

1117
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,600
Except their hash brown things are really good to dip in the cheese.

1118
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,600
So guess what?

1119
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
What?

1120
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,600
Home.

1121
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,600
Oh, they're trying to buy Wendy's. Sorry.

1122
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,600
Yes, home. I'm in it.

1123
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,600
The open beta is going to be in fall 2008.

1124
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,600
So the closed beta has been extended.

1125
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,600
However, Sony is going to be inviting more people to join.

1126
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,600
So maybe they'll actually update stuff in it like they said they were.

1127
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:28,600
How about they invite everyone to join and just release it?

1128
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Because I think they're still hashing out stuff.

1129
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,600
And according to some of the updates, there haven't really been updates.

1130
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,600
They've just been sort of sitting there going la la la.

1131
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,600
This takes me back to what was it?

1132
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,600
I want to say spring of 2006 when they're like,

1133
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,600
yeah, the PlayStation 3 is coming out in spring of 2006.

1134
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,600
Oh, wait, no, it's not.

1135
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,600
It's coming out next year.

1136
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,600
And hasn't home been delayed like four times now?

1137
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
Yeah.

1138
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
And we haven't had the boomerang.

1139
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Home spore forever, Duke Nukem, Chinese democracy.

1140
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,600
Come on.

1141
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,600
Well, not like we have democracy here.

1142
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Anyway.

1143
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,600
But yeah, Sony delays.

1144
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,600
Hey, you unplugged me, bastard.

1145
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,600
It's all right.

1146
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
It just makes my monitor go slightly dimmer.

1147
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Live radio.

1148
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,600
I had to get up for a minute. Sorry.

1149
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:31,600
So one thing that's not been delayed is any sort of sequels to Guitar Hero.

1150
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,600
And there's more rumors now coming out about Guitar Hero 4,

1151
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,600
including that, yes, they're going to jump on the rock band bandwagon,

1152
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:45,600
adding vocals, drums, and regular download content to the next game.

1153
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,600
One of the other things that they were saying that they want to add as well

1154
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,600
is local content from local bands.

1155
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,600
Although I'm assuming when they're saying local, that means major city local

1156
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:03,600
and not like, I don't know, Hoboken, you know.

1157
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,600
Whether this will happen or not, I'm sure we'll find out at E3.

1158
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,600
And if it does, does anyone think this is sort of copying?

1159
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,600
I mean, do we even want to go there?

1160
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,600
No. No other game has done this before.

1161
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,600
Well, good. It'll be the first.

1162
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,600
I don't know.

1163
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:24,600
What can they do to differentiate themselves from rock band?

1164
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Because you know that people are going to say something.

1165
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,600
They're, I don't know.

1166
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,600
They're going to make their drums look different.

1167
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
Or not.

1168
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,600
Here's the thing, though.

1169
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,600
Here's the thing that is going to piss me the F off,

1170
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,600
is that the controllers will not be compatible again.

1171
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,600
Now, I'm telling you what.

1172
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,600
There is going to be hell to pay from the consumers,

1173
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,600
and one of these games is going to be out.

1174
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,600
I mean, right now there's room for two,

1175
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,600
but one of these games will be shut out

1176
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,600
if they start making these controllers incompatible with each other.

1177
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Mark my words.

1178
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing.

1179
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,600
The controllers were incompatible because, well,

1180
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,600
Microsoft says all the controllers have to work with all the games, basically.

1181
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,600
I mean, guitar games have to work with all the guitar controllers, et cetera.

1182
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,600
So you won't ever run into that issue with the Xbox 360.

1183
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,600
Where you will run into this issue with is the Wii, PlayStation 2,

1184
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,600
and PlayStation 3 versions, where they just say,

1185
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,600
where Activision's like, well, you know what?

1186
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:27,600
We're just not going to license you to use these controllers to fuck off, buy ours.

1187
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,600
I don't know.

1188
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,600
It's just kind of lame.

1189
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,600
It's kind of lame, but the same, I guess.

1190
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,600
You can't just have one fighting game, one music game,

1191
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,600
but these games are expensive.

1192
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,600
Thank you.

1193
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,600
I think it's a little too late.

1194
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,600
You have to innovate or get out.

1195
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:51,600
They originally were kind of trying to corner the hardcore guitar playing thing.

1196
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,600
It's kind of like In a Groove and Dance Dance Revolution,

1197
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,600
whereas In the Groove was more technical.

1198
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,600
It was a lot harder.

1199
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
And they're going to do stuff like that,

1200
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,600
whereas Rock Band's more accessible.

1201
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,600
Granted, it's really expensive to get into it,

1202
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,600
but it's more accessible, it's easier.

1203
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,600
And one was a giant flop,

1204
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,600
although you have about 100 hardcore fans that will scream and bitch

1205
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,600
and try to tell you otherwise.

1206
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,600
Well, here's my thing.

1207
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
Now, harmonix is not developing the game.

1208
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,600
Is it going to be any good?

1209
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,600
I don't know if Guitar Hero 3 was quite as good as Guitar Hero 2.

1210
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,600
I'm sure there's people who will go both ways.

1211
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,600
But the fact that they're developing entirely new stuff for it,

1212
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,600
like some sort of singing thing and that kind of stuff,

1213
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,600
I don't know.

1214
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,600
And we'll harmonix Sue because they're kind of ripping them off.

1215
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,600
But then again, Konami's been ripped off on all this stuff,

1216
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
so I don't know.

1217
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,600
When's Konami going to do something?

1218
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,600
That's what I want to know.

1219
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,600
They've been sitting there kind of going doo-dee-doo-doo.

1220
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,600
They realize they missed out.

1221
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,600
How do I mark a music game to the U.S.?

1222
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,600
I don't know.

1223
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,600
At least we have DDR.

1224
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,600
Oh, goody.

1225
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Hey, one game I have not been playing enough of lately

1226
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,600
that I really need to go back and beat

1227
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
because this game was all kinds of awesome,

1228
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,600
and I don't know why I fell out of the habit of playing.

1229
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
Lost Odyssey. Awesomeness.

1230
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,600
Lost Odyssey just got some download content.

1231
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,600
Maybe that might motivate some people to give it another look.

1232
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,600
It is the triple bonus pack, and it will set you back 200 points.

1233
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,600
That's not too bad. It's about 250.

1234
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,600
The triple bonus pack has the memory lamp,

1235
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,600
which will allow you to watch all the past event scenes again,

1236
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,600
which is good because Lost Odyssey,

1237
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,600
you know, high-def cutscenes, awesomeness, good times.

1238
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,600
Shattered Bond is a new antique

1239
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,600
that adds another one of the dream sequences in The Lost Odyssey,

1240
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,600
which you really have to kind of experience

1241
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
a Lost Odyssey dream sequence.

1242
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,600
It's unlike anything we've seen in gaming for a little while since Zork.

1243
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,600
This is reading.

1244
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,600
But it's cool. I can't explain it.

1245
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,600
But the stories are really good.

1246
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,600
They're really good.

1247
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,600
Whatever. You didn't play enough of it.

1248
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,600
Killer Machine is a new ring also that comes out with the game,

1249
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,600
and rings are an essential part of the game.

1250
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,600
If you play the game, you know that.

1251
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,600
So there you have it. Download content for Lost Odyssey.

1252
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,600
Also some other download content.

1253
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,600
I think, what was it? Army of Two?

1254
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Got some download content this week as well.

1255
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,600
So if you're into that game, there's some new download content

1256
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,600
you can check out there.

1257
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,600
600 points for the SSC challenge.

1258
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:21,600
I have Army of Your Mom.

1259
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Well, Army of Me and Your Mom would be too.

1260
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,600
You know what?

1261
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,600
The next story makes me sad.

1262
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,600
Why is that?

1263
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,600
Well, it doesn't make me sad as far as their stance,

1264
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:38,600
but it makes me sad for the industry in general.

1265
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:43,600
There is a story run in the New York Times about Stern Pinball

1266
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,600
being the last pinball factory left in the world.

1267
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:51,600
And the president of the company, Gary Stern,

1268
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,600
basically said that they're planning on sticking around

1269
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,600
and that they expect the industry to rebound in the next ten years.

1270
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:02,600
It's basically become more of the enthusiast's market these days.

1271
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,600
So now that when they're selling their machines,

1272
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,600
they're not going to arcades, they're going to people.

1273
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:14,600
They're going to the people who really care about the product.

1274
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:15,600
I just think it's sad.

1275
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Damn you, Williams.

1276
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,600
I just hope it doesn't go away forever.

1277
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,600
You know what I mean?

1278
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,600
When you hear there's only one left, it's kind of sad.

1279
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:25,600
Well, they've got the market.

1280
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,600
The end of an era.

1281
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,600
Hey, you know what I was reading up on that I really want to go to this year?

1282
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,600
The spiral table they did was good.

1283
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,600
California Extreme.

1284
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,600
I've got to make sure I go this year.

1285
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,600
Oh, I love California Extreme.

1286
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,600
I know.

1287
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:40,600
Pinna-Go-Go is, I won't be going to it this year because I'll have company.

1288
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,600
Oh, sad.

1289
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,600
But Pinna-Go-Go is Memorial Day weekend.

1290
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,600
Oh, fun.

1291
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,600
I think I actually have Memorial Day weekend free this year.

1292
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:50,600
Oh, yeah, because Fond of May isn't happening for us this year.

1293
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:51,600
We're sitting out this year.

1294
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,600
So maybe I'll go to that instead.

1295
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
We'll see.

1296
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Dan, where are we going?

1297
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,600
We'll see.

1298
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Penny Arcade Expo, by the way,

1299
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,600
as long as my medical issues pull through, I'm going,

1300
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:08,600
which means, you know, it is the last weekend in August, Seattle.

1301
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,600
I want to go.

1302
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:15,600
And, by the way, going to be a huge conglomeration of All Games podcasters there.

1303
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,600
Like, at least six different shows have representation, if not more.

1304
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
It's going to be pretty awesome.

1305
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
So, good, I hope you can go, Jamie.

1306
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,600
I hope you can talk to wife into letting you go, Loki.

1307
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,600
So, we'll see.

1308
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,600
Speaking of Loki, he's got our last story for tonight.

1309
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,600
And after that story is read, we're going to open up the Skype line,

1310
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,600
which is available at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype,

1311
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Orange Lounge Radio.

1312
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Yes, when he's not butchering franchises or threatening Michael Bay to a fist fight,

1313
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:47,600
Ui Bull is trying to hit up other franchises for movie options,

1314
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,600
and one of those franchises happened to be World of Warcraft,

1315
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:57,600
in which he, I don't know, tried to get Blizzard to allow him to create a movie for,

1316
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,600
in which Blizzard COO Paul Sams replied,

1317
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,600
We will not sell the movie rights, not to you, especially not to you.

1318
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,600
Bravo!

1319
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:17,600
You know, they're worried that because it's such a success online,

1320
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,600
that a bad movie would destroy that oncoming income, perhaps, or at least tarnish it.

1321
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,600
Good for Blizzard for realizing what epic mistake they would have made

1322
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,600
if they'd let him direct this movie.

1323
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,600
So, are we sure this is actually true?

1324
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,600
I think it is.

1325
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:34,600
You know, because part of me goes,

1326
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,600
this seems like a fanboy might have said this or something, I don't know.

1327
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,600
So, all right, well that's going to do it for tonight's stories,

1328
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,600
until we get to last minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki has a few of tonight.

1329
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,600
But for now, we're going to open up the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1330
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:50,600
our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1331
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,600
Let's go to the phones and open them up, and we've got a call.

1332
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,600
Hello, caller, are you there?

1333
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,600
Hey, what's up, guys?

1334
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Hey, who is this?

1335
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,600
This is Toshin from All Games and every other chat room known to man.

1336
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,600
What's up, Toshin? You listen to pretty much all the All Games shows, don't you?

1337
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,600
I listen to a lot of them because I'm a bored person.

1338
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,600
That's all right. That's why it's there.

1339
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:15,600
You know, some people listen to regular radio, some people listen to All Games radio, if they're cool.

1340
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:16,600
Yeah.

1341
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:19,600
But you've been listening to All Games for ages, haven't you?

1342
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,600
Like, you were with them back when they were, what was that other thing, pseudo or whatever they had?

1343
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,600
Yep.

1344
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,600
Way back there. No, I actually skipped G4.

1345
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,600
Wow.

1346
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,600
But I was around back when Scott was on the East Coast and all that.

1347
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,600
Well, that's because you're in Canada, so you kind of had to skip out on G4, right?

1348
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Yeah, I've never seen anything related to G4 ever, which is probably safer.

1349
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,600
Ah, you ain't missin' much.

1350
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,600
Anyhow, well, what's on your mind?

1351
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:49,600
I've come into a new console called Xbox 360, and I was wondering if you could recommend me some stuff.

1352
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:56,600
Xbox 360. The Xbox 360 is awesome. Are you online with your Xbox 360? Have you checked out Xbox Live Arcade yet?

1353
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:06,600
I'm actually working on that as we speak. I'm on a temporary laptop because my other PC got fried over the week, so I haven't been online much, but that's a different story.

1354
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:11,600
But as soon as I get it back, I'm going to definitely hit up Live, and I'm going to need some friends and all that kind of stuff.

1355
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,600
Good times.

1356
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:13,600
Good times.

1357
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Jamie's going to recommend the Orange Box for Portal.

1358
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,600
I was going to say, on Xbox Live Arcade, you definitely want to get some stuff. You've got to get Geometry Wars. You've got to get...

1359
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,600
Symphony of the Night.

1360
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:28,600
Symphony of the Night. Oh, hell yeah. You're a music game fan, right? That's what brought you to LR in the first place, right?

1361
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,600
Yes.

1362
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,600
You've got to get Res HD. In fact...

1363
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,600
Ooh, nice. I have that for my Dreamcast, too.

1364
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,600
In fact, we still have a code for Res HD that I never gave away.

1365
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:45,600
And now, if he just got an Xbox 360, he might be the one person who doesn't already have Res.

1366
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Which I don't.

1367
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,600
I might have to give Toshin the code for Res HD.

1368
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,600
So...

1369
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,600
But, well, we have to make Toshin do something to earn it.

1370
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,600
What can we make Toshin do to earn it?

1371
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,600
I'm on the hook, am I?

1372
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,600
You what?

1373
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,600
I'm on the hook, am I?

1374
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,600
Oh, Footy Monster's complaining because he doesn't have Res either.

1375
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,600
Well, I don't know. We'll figure something out.

1376
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,600
Toshin, you and I will have a chat offline and maybe we can hook you up with Res.

1377
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Maybe I'll have to make you and Footy Monster fight for it.

1378
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,600
Ooh, maybe we'll make...

1379
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,600
I'm sure. He hits his own podcast.

1380
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:26,600
You know what we'll do? We'll make Footy and Toshin play a game next week on the show.

1381
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,600
We'll get some guests and we'll play match game. Are you going to be here next week?

1382
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,600
Up here.

1383
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,600
Alright. We're going to get Toshin. I'll make Footy come next week.

1384
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,600
Footy and Toshin will play epic match game.

1385
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,600
We're going to play epic match game next week. Why is it epic?

1386
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,600
You'll find out. I have a new idea for match game to make it epic.

1387
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,600
So we're going to play epic match game next week.

1388
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,600
Alright.

1389
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,600
He's already fucking smacked me.

1390
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,600
Anyhow.

1391
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,600
What other types of games do you like, Toshin?

1392
01:10:54,600 --> 01:11:00,600
I mean, I like XBLA. I've played a couple of those games.

1393
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,600
I like anything. I'm pretty neutral. I mean, I won't knock down a game until I've tried it.

1394
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,600
So I'm pretty open to trying anything like RPGs.

1395
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,600
If you like RPGs, you must, must, must get Lost Odyssey. It's amazing.

1396
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,600
It's not getting enough buzz out there. I don't know why.

1397
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:25,600
For classic RPG fans, if you like your old school RPGs from Super Nintendo and the Final Fantasy and stuff, you will love Lost Odyssey.

1398
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,600
Okay.

1399
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,600
Other types of games. Well, of course, Portal if you're into shooters and the Orange Box is just a great deal overall, frankly.

1400
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,600
Loki, what about my recommendation from you?

1401
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,600
Grand Theft Auto IV.

1402
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,600
What's that?

1403
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
I keep hearing stuff about it, though.

1404
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Never heard of it.

1405
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Alright.

1406
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
I'll have to look into that one.

1407
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,600
Well, there you have some suggestions, Toshin. Good luck to you and congratulations on your purchase.

1408
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,600
I'll definitely check that out.

1409
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,600
Any last thoughts for our listeners?

1410
01:11:53,600 --> 01:12:00,600
Um, just enjoy the weather. It's getting nice out and turn down the garage.

1411
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,600
It is very, very hot out here right now. We're trying to enjoy it, but it's difficult when you're cooking alive out here.

1412
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,600
So we're cooking Mama alive.

1413
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,600
Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

1414
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,600
What was that?

1415
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,600
Not my mom.

1416
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,600
Alright, Toshin, we gotta let you go. Take care, buddy.

1417
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
Alright, see you later.

1418
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,600
Bye-bye.

1419
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Why is Skype acting all janky tonight?

1420
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,600
It's acting very slow.

1421
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:25,600
I don't like it.

1422
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,600
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1423
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,600
Hey, it's Ronma. What's up, everyone?

1424
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:37,600
Not much, although I've gotta say Skylark is like, in chat rooms, Skylark is like jumping up and down screaming Eternal Sonata, which also was a really good game.

1425
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:45,600
And if you like more action-oriented RPGs, like not of the Kingdom Hearts caliber necessarily, it's just a great story.

1426
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,600
If you like a good story, I do recommend Eternal Sonata.

1427
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,600
Alright, what's up, Rama?

1428
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,600
Well, a couple of things before I begin.

1429
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,600
I'm glad that you guys finally mentioned Video Power, because every time you mention Starrcade, I'm like,

1430
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:05,600
I've never seen this show, and I'm the only one that's ever seen Video Power.

1431
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,600
I have never seen Video Power, but apparently Jamie has.

1432
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,600
I've seen Video Power.

1433
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,600
Really? How did I miss this show?

1434
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:21,600
There was one episode where the kid had to Velcro a Nintendo Entertainment System box to his head, like he was running through a maze.

1435
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Mm-hmm.

1436
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,600
It was funny.

1437
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,600
Good times. Were you a contestant on Video Power or something?

1438
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,600
No, but believe it or not, Video Power was actually two seasons.

1439
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,600
The first season was with the kid that hosted it as a game show.

1440
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:42,600
He would come in, show the Video Power cartoon, and after the end of the show, you put up either a review or a secret code, and that was it.

1441
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:47,600
Then the second season was nothing but the game show aspect of it.

1442
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:54,600
So it started as a game advice show, and then it morphed into a game show? That's kind of weird.

1443
01:13:54,600 --> 01:14:04,600
Yeah, it was sponsored by Acclaim because it was all about NARC, Quirk, Bigfoot, Arch-Vribals, all that together as a superhero team.

1444
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,600
Whatever happened to Acclaim? Are they still around?

1445
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:08,600
I don't remember that.

1446
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:09,600
No, they went under.

1447
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Oh, hmm. They were big back in the day.

1448
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,600
But they came back doing MMOs now.

1449
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,600
Interesting.

1450
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:25,600
Well, VidPowa, what other old school... We actually used to have a chatter named VidPowa now that I think about it. That's why I said it that way, because there was a chatter all the time that we had here.

1451
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,600
I wonder if they got his name from that.

1452
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,600
What other types of old school video game based TV shows do you remember?

1453
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,600
I actually remembered a Qbert cartoon and Donkey Kong.

1454
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:42,600
Yes. I remember the Qbert cartoon because it had the Valley Girl sort of character on there too.

1455
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
Mm-hmm.

1456
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,600
That said gag me with a rocket ship.

1457
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,600
I remember a Pac-Man cartoon, but I don't remember Qbert.

1458
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,600
The Pac-Man cartoons were good too.

1459
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,600
That too.

1460
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
Yeah.

1461
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:57,600
I remember one year they had Pac-Man saving Santa Claus, and they played it at night, and I was so happy.

1462
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:06,600
I always wanted to go on Nick Arcade, but I never did because my parents didn't take me places where I could go on. What?

1463
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
I did watch Captain In and it pissed me off.

1464
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,600
Why is that?

1465
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,600
Because I was like, dude, these characters aren't like that. It sucks.

1466
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,600
I loved the Super Mario Brothers Super Show.

1467
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,600
I liked the Zelda episodes.

1468
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,600
Yes. Zelda Fridays were always awesome.

1469
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,600
That's all on DVD now.

1470
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,600
I actually did like the Super Mario World one they did too. That one was pretty cool.

1471
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,600
Mm-hmm. Good times.

1472
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,600
And you could always do the Mario at the end of the show.

1473
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,600
All right. Enough reminiscing. Anything else you want to share with listeners, Rama?

1474
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,600
Skye, did you get Mario Kart Wii yet?

1475
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,600
Did you call me Scott?

1476
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
No.

1477
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,600
I said Skye.

1478
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,600
I was like, wrong show.

1479
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,600
I know he's speaking New York.

1480
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,600
Did I get Mario Kart Wii yet? I did not.

1481
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:47,600
Yes.

1482
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,600
I haven't picked it up yet.

1483
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,600
Why not?

1484
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,600
I spent the money on a new air conditioner for the garage today, so I'll probably get it this week.

1485
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,600
It's a great game. I'm loving it.

1486
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:06,600
I know. Loki had the advanced copy and we played it, so I got my fill of it, but I will buy the game because I do want to play online with other people, even if Toadette's in the game and I can't stand her.

1487
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,600
It's also Baby Peach. That's not so bad.

1488
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,600
That's true.

1489
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:15,600
Loki, I want your friend code. I owe you an ass beating in Mario Kart.

1490
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,600
I'll think about it as soon as I get online when I'm stopped, you know, playing.

1491
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,600
God, you're lazy.

1492
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,600
Yeah, as soon as he can tear himself away from Grand Theft Auto IV.

1493
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,600
All right, Rama. We got to let you go to get more calls, but take care, buddy.

1494
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,600
All right, cool. All right. Later, guys.

1495
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:28,600
Later.

1496
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,600
All right.

1497
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,600
I know. Good luck tearing Loki away from Grand Theft Auto IV for a few days.

1498
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,600
What the fuck is wrong with Skype today? It's running horribly on my end. At least the calls sound fine.

1499
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's Radio. Who's this?

1500
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,600
Hey, what's up, guys? This is Footy Monster.

1501
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Well, hello, Footy Monster. So, are you going to be here next week?

1502
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,600
Definitely. I want that free coffee for $60.

1503
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:55,600
All right, all right. It's going to be you and Toshin duking it out in Epic Match Game. Just you wait.

1504
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
The gloves are off.

1505
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,600
All right.

1506
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,600
Whatever you want to call it. Yeah.

1507
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,600
All right. It's going to be good times.

1508
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
So, what's on your mind, Footy?

1509
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:09,600
Well, basically, I wanted to share with you guys what I think personally is the best RPG I've played in a long time.

1510
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,600
Persona 3 again?

1511
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,600
No. No. It's actually The World Ends With You for a DS that came out just last week.

1512
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,600
Ah.

1513
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:24,600
And let me tell you, it's out there with console RPGs. It's pretty fantastic.

1514
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,600
You know, if I wasn't in such a PSP mood this week, I would have totally bought that game.

1515
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,600
I think the soundtrack is pretty hopping.

1516
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:36,600
Describe what this game is all about because I've not seen much about it except for some of the artwork and the soundtrack.

1517
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,600
How does this game work?

1518
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,600
Well, it has different mechanics.

1519
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:46,600
Let me start by saying it's a game that can be as hardcore as you want it to be,

1520
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,600
but at the same time it can be as simple as you want it to be, which I think is very interesting because for portable people,

1521
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:58,600
especially RPG players on the go, maybe they don't want to delve too much into an RPG that's super complex,

1522
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:05,600
but yet this game allows you to make it either really complex, like for instance, Shadow Slayer plays it in a really simple way,

1523
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,600
and I've played it in a super complex way in which I do much more stuff,

1524
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,600
yet we're both enjoying it just as much, which I thought was brilliant.

1525
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,600
Interesting.

1526
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:19,600
Like, for instance, the game works on both screens at the same time and you control two characters at the same time,

1527
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,600
one on the bottom screen and one on the top screen.

1528
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,600
On the bottom screen you control your styles to move and attack,

1529
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:30,600
and on the top screen you move by your D-pad or if you're right-handed or left-handed with the face buttons.

1530
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:37,600
And all you do, which sounds really convoluted because you had to basically work on both planes at the same time,

1531
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,600
but the beauty is that you can actually set the other character to move automatically if you don't want to,

1532
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,600
or maybe automatically if you don't move it by every two seconds,

1533
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,600
so that way it gives you this freedom of like, okay, do I want to be really hardcore right now,

1534
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,600
or do I just, I'm just playing for 30 minutes and I don't want to really buzz my head in with this?

1535
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,600
And I thought that was pretty impressive.

1536
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,600
Same with, on the fly, four different difficulty settings that you can change.

1537
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,600
You can go with easy, with super easy, normal, which is okay except for the blast battle,

1538
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:08,600
hard, which is always hard, and ultimate, which is impossible, basically.

1539
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,600
You know what it reminds me of when you describe that whole character thing,

1540
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,600
is for some reason I'm having flashbacks to Secret of Mana.

1541
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:17,600
Like, remember how you could kind of customize the second and third players that you had?

1542
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,600
You had the girl and the little sprite guy.

1543
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,600
Like, you could kind of, you could customize the way they behaved,

1544
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,600
but then, like, if you really wanted to, you just have a second person control the character.

1545
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,600
Like, you could make it a two-player game.

1546
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,600
Or if you're really hardcore, you can control them all yourself.

1547
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,600
Right. That's kind of the thing, only that you can't really let anyone else control it.

1548
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,600
Although I was thinking when I was playing this game with Jack,

1549
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,600
we were thinking, dude, how awesome would it be if with Wi-Fi you could control top screen

1550
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,600
and I could control bottom screen or, you know, vice versa.

1551
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,600
It would be so much fun.

1552
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,600
But this game really surprised me because I actually wrote in the audience forms

1553
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,600
a small, like, super tiny paragraph that basically describes how I feel about this game.

1554
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,600
Because it's, I tried to wrap it out in a way that I let people call in as well,

1555
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,600
and not, you know...

1556
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,600
So, if you allow me, I would like to read that, like, it's like five lines.

1557
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,600
Sure, of course, go for it.

1558
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,600
So, I basically, what I said is,

1559
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
it's far none of the best RPG I've played in a while,

1560
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:12,600
at least on portables,

1561
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,600
Mass Effect and Persona 3 take the cake on consoles for sure,

1562
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,600
at least in what I play lightly, right?

1563
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,600
I was totally hooked with the story and the impressive amount of plot twists

1564
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,600
that never seems to be interesting, which totally surprised me because

1565
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,600
I can't remember the last time a BS game or a PSP game engaged me in that way.

1566
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,600
In that way that I go, okay, I can't really put this down.

1567
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,600
Like, Lost Odyssey could do with you.

1568
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,600
That kind of commitment, which I was, it blew my mind really.

1569
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:43,600
The game definitely must be played by any DS owner

1570
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,600
just because it's really accessible as an RPG,

1571
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,600
because you can tone everything down,

1572
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:49,600
play easy, automatic on your partner,

1573
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,600
and just never worry about anything by looking at the cool story,

1574
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,600
or you can go all the way hardcore if you wanted to,

1575
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,600
if you're a really avid RPG player.

1576
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,600
And the music, as we've heard on the break today, is amazing,

1577
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,600
and if you haven't checked it out, you need to check it out

1578
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,600
because it's fantastic, it's out there with Persona 3,

1579
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,600
super modern, super upbeat,

1580
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:12,600
it has interesting beats that I really haven't heard in RPGs in a long time,

1581
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,600
because RPGs today were elves in science fiction, maybe,

1582
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,600
and Final Fantasy, and that's it.

1583
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,600
And this modern day setting is so refreshing.

1584
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,600
Like, you are in Shibuya, that's it, no frills, no nothing.

1585
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,600
It's just a very stylish Shibuya, that's it.

1586
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,600
You're in the middle of Tokyo.

1587
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,600
Here's one question I have about the game,

1588
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,600
because I have to admit, one of the turn-offs for the game for me

1589
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,600
is that it's on the DS.

1590
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,600
I don't like seeing these types of hardcore games on the DS,

1591
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:40,600
because I don't know, maybe I'm just old-fashioned,

1592
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,600
but the way I like to play my games is I like to have that big experience

1593
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,600
on the big television and really immerse myself with everything.

1594
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,600
I feel like I can't be as immersed in the DS.

1595
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,600
DS is more like a casual game system for me,

1596
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
and I know I need to kind of get over it.

1597
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,600
But do you think this game might have been better if it wasn't on the DS,

1598
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,600
if it was on the actual console?

1599
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,600
Well, that's the thing.

1600
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
That's why I'm so impressed by Square Enix here,

1601
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,600
proving that they can do something that's not Dragon Quest

1602
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,600
and that it's not Final Fantasy.

1603
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,600
They made a game for the DS.

1604
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,600
It is meant to be played with the DS,

1605
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
and you can't play it on another system.

1606
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,600
It's that simple, which I thought was brilliant.

1607
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,600
I mean, the dual screen,

1608
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,600
dual screens are not used to show you a map.

1609
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,600
There's action happening on both screens at the same time.

1610
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,600
Basically, just to explain real quick,

1611
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,600
you're fighting enemies on the bottom screen,

1612
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,600
and the same enemies are cloned on the top screen,

1613
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,600
and it's kind of like fighting on a two-dual plane kind of battle.

1614
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,600
So if you kill someone on the bottom screen,

1615
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,600
it dies on the top screen as well,

1616
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,600
and they share the hit points from top to bottom,

1617
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,600
and you and your partner share the same hit points bar.

1618
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,600
So if your partner falls,

1619
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,600
it starts hitting out from your bottom screen life bar, basically.

1620
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,600
It's like a vertical bar.

1621
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:48,600
Interesting.

1622
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,600
So it's a very interesting way that they've designed it.

1623
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,600
They've decided it in a way that,

1624
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,600
well, man, I didn't expect it.

1625
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,600
I didn't expect Square to blow my mind,

1626
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,600
not after what they've done lately, if you know what I mean.

1627
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,600
They haven't really been creative,

1628
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,600
and this is creative,

1629
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,600
which I thought was impressive.

1630
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,600
The combat system is steep.

1631
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,600
The art style, oh my God, that's great.

1632
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,600
Seriously, it's not 3D,

1633
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:13,600
but it's such a good 3D that doesn't make you miss 3D.

1634
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,600
Rave, rave, rave.

1635
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,600
That's all you're doing about this game,

1636
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,600
but that's great.

1637
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,600
I'm sorry. It's really, really good.

1638
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,600
I didn't go into the game because it looks emo-ish,

1639
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,600
and it's not my style.

1640
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,600
God damn it, I got into that game,

1641
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,600
and seriously, my life was over for a week and a half.

1642
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,600
I finished the game two days ago,

1643
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,600
and it's one of those games that I wish I hadn't played

1644
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,600
so I could play it again.

1645
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,600
It's that kind of thing.

1646
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,600
Wow. All right.

1647
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,600
You know how Rave out Persona 3?

1648
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:42,600
I never actually finished Persona 3.

1649
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
I got pranked out.

1650
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,600
This one, I'm not getting pranked out.

1651
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,600
And there's a lot of stuff to do after the game's over,

1652
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600
which I think is really interesting as well.

1653
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,600
There's a lot of stuff to do.

1654
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,600
It's interesting because with Grand Theft Auto IV

1655
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,600
kind of taking all the headlines this week,

1656
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,600
it's really interesting that a game like this

1657
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,600
might kind of slip under the radar

1658
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,600
that people may kind of miss out on.

1659
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,600
So if you're listening to this program...

1660
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,600
I'm getting GTA IV myself,

1661
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,600
and I'm glad that I actually put the time,

1662
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,600
since the game came out,

1663
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,600
to play it before this game came out

1664
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,600
because I probably would have lost it otherwise.

1665
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:18,600
So that's why we dedicated last week's review to that game.

1666
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,600
We did a totally in-depth review,

1667
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
and I can't recommend it enough.

1668
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,600
That's why I wanted to come on your show, guys,

1669
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,600
because I know there's a lot of RPG listeners here,

1670
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,600
and you as well.

1671
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
I mean, you guys play RPGs as well.

1672
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,600
So I wanted you to guys...

1673
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
You need to check this out before GTA comes in

1674
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:31,600
and steals your lives.

1675
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,600
That's what I'm saying.

1676
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,600
Too late for Loki,

1677
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,600
but there's still hope for me and Jamie.

1678
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,600
So if you're listening to this program,

1679
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,600
Footie demands that you put down Grand Theft Auto

1680
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,600
and check out The World Ends With You if you own DS.

1681
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:43,600
And I will.

1682
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,600
I promise you I'll check it out soon.

1683
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,600
Good stuff.

1684
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,600
All right.

1685
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,600
Footie, we've got to let you go take more calls,

1686
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,600
but have a good one, okay, buddy?

1687
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,600
No worries.

1688
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:51,600
See you guys later.

1689
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,600
All right, later.

1690
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,600
That was a very, very strongly worded recommendation

1691
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,600
for The World Ends With You.

1692
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,600
So, you know, I've been hearing a lot of good things

1693
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,600
about that game.

1694
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,600
I'm going to pick it up.

1695
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,600
Yeah, I think I want to too.

1696
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,600
Or I'll just wait until you get it and get sick of it

1697
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,600
and I'll borrow yours.

1698
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,600
We'll see what happens.

1699
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,600
Okay, let's take one more call.

1700
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,600
Why not?

1701
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:13,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1702
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,600
Who's this?

1703
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,600
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

1704
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,600
Your fearless webmaster has arrived.

1705
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,600
Well, hello, VXZXWQ Jason XQWV.

1706
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,600
Okay, you fail.

1707
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,600
You're done.

1708
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:27,600
I'm just kidding.

1709
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,600
What's up?

1710
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,600
You fail.

1711
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,600
Failed.

1712
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:35,600
I'm trying to decide what exactly I think of custom peripherals on the Wii.

1713
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:41,600
I caught the latter half of Bobby's show and was listening, of course,

1714
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:47,600
to his complaints about the real power controls with the Mario Kart Wii wheel

1715
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,600
and then Loki's earlier rant about the silly extensions for the baseball game

1716
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,600
that just puts the Wii out another foot so you can crack that priceless base

1717
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:03,600
and kill your TV even quicker when you let go on accident and it flails away.

1718
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:07,600
There was a long, long, long ago wish list that I had

1719
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,600
and one of those was Fatal Frame moving to Nintendo.

1720
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,600
I always, and I think I still do believe this,

1721
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:18,600
that the best – I need to take a step back.

1722
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,600
I'm failing.

1723
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,600
One of the things that I've always wanted to do is have a camera to play Fatal Frame

1724
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,600
and have it translate to the character controls in game.

1725
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,600
They never did that on the PS2 or Xbox, obviously,

1726
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,600
and apparently the fourth incarnation is coming to the Wii,

1727
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,600
when I'm not entirely sure, but I was reading that the other day.

1728
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:49,600
And I'm just trying to decide what worth a camera clamshell would be for the Wiimote

1729
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
or if it would be better as a dedicated controller

1730
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,600
or if the whole thing is just bumpkits and you should use the normal controller anyways.

1731
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
Here's my question.

1732
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,600
What having that extra clamshell and that extra stuff,

1733
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,600
what exactly does that bring to the experience?

1734
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,600
It would be the feeling.

1735
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,600
It would be the immersion.

1736
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,600
It would be the fact that you're not just pointing and changing channels on your TV.

1737
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:17,600
I mean, that's what the whole concept around this has been.

1738
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,600
It's been the attempt at immersion when the thing is impossible to do

1739
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,600
or when there may be situations that prevent you from doing it, i.e.,

1740
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,600
you don't golf in the rain or in the lightning storm in the snow.

1741
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,600
You don't drive off-road at 100 miles in a while.

1742
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,600
Maybe some people do, but they're just nuts.

1743
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,600
And you can't go around taking pictures of maniacal spirits that want to kill you.

1744
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,600
I've got to ask Loki what you think about that

1745
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,600
because you're a big anti-Wii peripheral person.

1746
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:51,600
Do you think that there are some games that might justify these different peripherals

1747
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,600
besides maybe just Wii Fit where that kind of is the game?

1748
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,600
For instance, Jason's example is Fatal Frame with an actual clamshell camera.

1749
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:05,600
Do you think that there's other types of games that maybe can justify the silly controllers?

1750
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,600
If it uses it in an interesting way.

1751
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:13,600
I've seen some... this is kind of like the middle ground, I would say.

1752
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,600
There was a game called Hooked Real Motion Fishing.

1753
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,600
And what it was is it was a clamshell that held the remote in,

1754
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:24,600
and then there was the reel that held the nunchuck in.

1755
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:29,600
So you had to use the actual reel like you're reeling in a fish.

1756
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,600
Granted, you could probably do that without the actual clamshell,

1757
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,600
but it still was using it to something...

1758
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:41,600
It's not as simple as just Mario Kart pretending it's a wheel.

1759
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,600
You can tilt the remote without the steering wheel attachment.

1760
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,600
Or even worse, with the baseball thing.

1761
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,600
You can play Wii Baseball without having that on there.

1762
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,600
People say, oh yeah, you can weight it and stuff, so it feels more natural.

1763
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,600
But yeah, then you can hit stuff and break it.

1764
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,600
But as far as if they came out with something that...

1765
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:07,600
It would be hard for them to do it, I guess, because of the infrared and stuff.

1766
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,600
However you would do that, it would be really weird.

1767
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,600
But if they could pull it off in a way that was interesting, then maybe, yeah, that would be worth it.

1768
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,600
But a lot of these things are just...

1769
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:24,600
It's basically aimed at the people that will only buy the Wii for Wii Sports.

1770
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,600
So they're like, oh hey, now I can add this tennis racket thing and it looks like I'm really playing tennis.

1771
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:34,600
It's just for the simple-minded, I guess. I don't know.

1772
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,600
Simple-minded. Very nice.

1773
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:42,600
The bridge version of what I was going to say is that on the one hand, I love the Super Scope 6.

1774
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,600
Absolutely. Games were fantastic.

1775
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,600
But it was so short-lived and you can't really reuse it.

1776
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,600
But on the flip side, I just want to play Fatal Frame with the camera.

1777
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,600
And thinking about that, I just had what probably amounts to one of the better ideas that cost way too damn much.

1778
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:04,600
I'm sorry, I have to interrupt and go back to the camera because the chat room is so winter.

1779
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,600
They said not only could that camera be used for Fatal Frame,

1780
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:17,600
but the clamshell camera could also be used to play the OLR dream game WhatTheyPlay.com Snap from last week's show.

1781
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:23,600
The other inspiration was Pokemon Snap 2, so believe me, I completely understand.

1782
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,600
Winner. Sorry, Jason.

1783
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,600
All three games we found a use for the camera.

1784
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:33,600
This is probably the most infeasible thing to do for cost, but this would be freaking awesome.

1785
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,600
The reason why I would want a camera is I would want an external screen.

1786
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,600
These cameras have viewfinders, they have the LCD screen and all that kind of stuff on it.

1787
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:50,600
It would be interesting to have a rigging where the Wiimote plugs into the Nintendo DS and the DS becomes your viewfinder.

1788
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:55,600
That way you have Fatal Frame on screen, but since you cannot at least,

1789
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,600
they have no better way to represent this than the PS2 version,

1790
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,600
you cannot see the ghost's blind eye, naked eye.

1791
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,600
You can through the viewfinder.

1792
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:09,600
With your DS, it shows you the same thing your character would be seeing in the environment based off where you're pointed on on the TV,

1793
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:16,600
but you will only be able to see the ghost and battle it through the DS screen, at least accurately anyway.

1794
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:22,600
That would be the funnest game I have ever played, swear to God.

1795
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:27,600
But it's probably not going to happen because that's been too damn intricate.

1796
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,600
Too damn intricate, sadly.

1797
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,600
A kid can dream, but oh man.

1798
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:42,600
I guess the end result of all this is that one-off and small-use peripherals will continue to come around,

1799
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,600
they will attempt to find reuse in which they will fail, they will fade into obscurity,

1800
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,600
and people will reminisce like we do the Super Scope.

1801
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,600
And the Virtual Boy.

1802
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:57,600
Alright, Jason, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call.

1803
01:31:57,600 --> 01:31:58,600
Of course.

1804
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,600
Take care, buddy. And I hope you get your dream game.

1805
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,600
Alright, bye-bye.

1806
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,600
That would be a very expensive setup though, but I mean, it sounds pretty cool.

1807
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,600
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight, guys.

1808
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:11,600
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but we've got to wrap it up.

1809
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,600
We have kind of a long show, we still have a post-show live thing to do.

1810
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:22,600
So, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought, but before I do that, Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

1811
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,600
Sure, I have a few, I guess.

1812
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,600
There's a game coming out that's got a great name, so I think it's worth checking it out.

1813
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:36,600
It's a RTS game called Stalin vs. the Martians.

1814
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:44,600
And basically you play Joseph Stalin, and you have to save Russia from Martians.

1815
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:52,600
And it's kind of like a real-time strategy game, looks similar to maybe Civilization or something like that.

1816
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,600
Interesting name, though.

1817
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,600
Let's see here.

1818
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:10,600
Apparently, our friend Lord Voldemort is on a road trip now to remove Grand Theft Auto 4 ads from US transit lines.

1819
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:16,600
And apparently he has sent emails to Miami Mayor Carlos Alvarez saying,

1820
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:27,600
Grand Theft Auto games have been obsessively played by a number of teens who have then copy-catted the outrageous sociopathic violence in the games and killed innocent people.

1821
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:34,600
And so, he is being himself, I guess.

1822
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,600
Now, this is actually pretty cool.

1823
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:46,600
You know how they're doing Street Fighter 2 HD, which is basically an HD remix of Street Fighter, all the stuff redrawn and stuff like that?

1824
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:53,600
Well, there is a homebrew project being done to do something very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

1825
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,600
Nice.

1826
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:59,600
They're redrawing all the characters, and it looks pretty good so far, with new sprites.

1827
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,600
They're going to add MP3 music to it, true 3D special stages.

1828
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:09,600
And then, I guess, a bunch more stuff.

1829
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:12,600
256 colors with one alpha channel and all sorts of fun.

1830
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,600
I'd buy that.

1831
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,600
That sounds awesome.

1832
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,600
That's what the Sonic 2 on Xbox Live should have been in the first place.

1833
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:38,600
Yeah. And then, apparently, you remember Ben Heck, his PlayStation 3 laptop that he made went up on auction and actually ended up selling for $9,000 online with all of the proceeds going to the National Cancer Coalition.

1834
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,600
Alright, at least it's a good cause.

1835
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:48,600
Yeah, so that's pretty awesome, but if that's not good enough, he is going to be starting much like he did with the Xbox 360.

1836
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:59,600
His how-to guide, and he has the first installment in gadget right now, so you can check that out and make your own PS3 laptop if you can do that.

1837
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,600
And that is it.

1838
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,600
Alright, then that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

1839
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,600
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought, and I'll start tonight.

1840
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:15,600
My final thought is, ouch, has pain.

1841
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:16,600
Dr. Sankar, your final thought?

1842
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,600
Tired, hot, headache.

1843
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,600
Loki, your final thought?

1844
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,600
More Grand Theft Auto 4!

1845
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,600
I'm going to Vegas this week.

1846
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,600
Ooh, lucky you. Lucky, lucky you.

1847
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,600
I have to go train people.

1848
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,600
Thank you everybody for downloading and tuning into Orange Lounge Radio.

1849
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,600
We really appreciate your support.

1850
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,600
Remember, it's because of you guys that independent podcasting works.

1851
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:38,600
So please, if you enjoy our show, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.

1852
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,600
If you tell two friends about our show, then slowly but surely we can take over the world.

1853
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,600
And hey, leave us some nice words on podcast review sites, too, such as iTunes.

1854
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:51,600
We could use some more five-star reviews there, or Podcast Alley, any of those places, dig.com.

1855
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Any place that lists podcasts, say something nice about Orange Lounge Radio.

1856
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,600
It really helps to spread the word, yes, it really does work, believe it or not.

1857
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,600
That's going to do it for tonight.

1858
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,600
Thank you guys.

1859
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,600
Until then, next week on the program, Epic Match Game.

1860
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,600
I promise it will be good.

1861
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,600
I'm Rob Roberts.

1862
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,600
She's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

1863
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,600
He's Loki.
