00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:05,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:14,719
[SPEAKER_02]: To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:21,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:41,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say it was the bow.

6
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:07,648
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.

7
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:36,916
[SPEAKER_11]: The Cars Are All Ghost Cars

8
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:28,270
[SPEAKER_04]: so yeah that's pretty awesome I guess that's coming in August but I'm really looking forward to the expansions for the maps whenever the hell those are going to come out what is the obsession with motorcycles in racing games lately because you know we had Project Gotham 4 right added them and then we have Mario Kart Wii is now all of a sudden got motorcycles and now Burnout it's like 2008 is the year of motorcycle well I guess Project Gotham came out in 07 but still it's like you know all the rage right now what's up with that

9
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:30,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, something different.

10
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:31,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

11
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:34,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you prefer motorcycle racing to car racing?

12
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't prefer either.

13
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer, well, I'd have to say I like car better.

14
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:44,893
[SPEAKER_04]: I think motorcycle racing is much cooler when you have a stick that you beat people with off the side of the car.

15
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:45,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly, road rush.

16
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:52,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, I'm more of a fan of when they had Need for Speed 2, and then this is not Underground 2 or anything like that.

17
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,198
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the second Need for Speed game.

18
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Outhouse as a giant T-Rex statue.

19
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:12,666
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

20
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:44,691
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, one game we love here at Orange Lounge Radio is the Eye of Judgment, which, by the way, I checked the Orange Lounge Radio wiki today.

21
00:03:45,011 --> 00:04:01,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we have no official Wikipedia entry anymore because some a-hole nuked it, we now have our own wiki, orangeloungeradio.wikia.com, and I was looking at the latest Eye of Judgment sales figures, which now our chatters are tracking for us, just shy of 200,000 worldwide.

22
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:02,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Never going to happen.

23
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:04,425
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

24
00:04:24,707 --> 00:04:25,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

25
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:28,450
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the Eye of Judgment set-to-promo cards.

26
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,673
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do, you watch the official PlayStation blog starting next Friday.

27
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:39,058
[SPEAKER_04]: And, oh, I see why they're rare, because you have to be one of the first few hundred who registers with the mailing list, and then you get the rarities.

28
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:40,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So only a few hundred of these are going to go out.

29
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Or... One of them will be Xeroxed and put all over the internet.

30
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:47,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Or you could just Xerox the ones right there that are available on the website.

31
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:48,344
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

32
00:04:48,364 --> 00:04:48,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

33
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:52,125
[SPEAKER_04]: The ones that are going around blogs, though, you've got to look at those black bars carefully.

34
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Those black bars are what the Eye of Judgment reads.

35
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,226
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all the same on these cards.

36
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So not that easy, Loki.

37
00:04:58,107 --> 00:04:58,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, darn.

38
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:02,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we'll just have to wait for one of the hundreds of people that actually... Oh, who cares?

39
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,509
[SPEAKER_11]: No one plays the game.

40
00:05:03,549 --> 00:05:04,069
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.

41
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,550
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

42
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,550
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf is in chat.

43
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,891
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually owns Eye of Judgment.

44
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:13,032
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a big supporter of trying to move a million copies of them.

45
00:05:13,352 --> 00:05:15,372
[SPEAKER_04]: He says the best part is that you have to pay $14.99 just to use those cards.

46
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:17,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

47
00:05:18,126 --> 00:05:19,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Since, you know, you gotta get set too.

48
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:19,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

49
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:20,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Way to support that.

50
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:21,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

51
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:26,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, we don't get to count expansion sales towards our million.

52
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:26,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

53
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter anyways.

54
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do get to count sales of Let's Ride Friends Forever, let's not forget.

55
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all ten of those.

56
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:38,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, another game that we're not counting is Portal.

57
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, Loki would be in that tingle suit right now.

58
00:05:43,494 --> 00:05:44,834
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing we didn't count Portal.

59
00:05:46,235 --> 00:06:12,037
[SPEAKER_05]: well basically they have said from Valve that we will not be seeing a new portal this year but they are going to do a new game that is as revolutionary they say as Half-Life 2 was to the original Half-Life he's quoted as saying it won't be portal with different colors so we're going to be getting something new from Valve I say good for them

60
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:13,764
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

61
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, will it be good?

62
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Dartetsuya in chat suggests Portal 2.

63
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:51,161
[SPEAKER_04]: No, really, there's cake this time.

64
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:56,225
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, because the cake is made with, like, dust.

65
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I say in Portal 2 you're going after pie.

66
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:00,267
[SPEAKER_04]: What's better than cake?

67
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:00,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Pie.

68
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:01,668
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

69
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:02,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a birthday pie.

70
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a birthday pie.

71
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:10,977
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can eat pie by that time, because, you know, the whole pancreas drama of mine.

72
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:13,460
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's in two weeks for us?

73
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,980
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

74
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:14,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Margaret Cho.

75
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

76
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:16,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Your birthday present a little late.

77
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:17,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get pie.

78
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:19,006
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can eat it.

79
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:21,529
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have to be low-fat Weight Watchers pie.

80
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:23,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat-free cheesecake.

81
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather eat barf.

82
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:31,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's not cake, but it's definitely coming a lot sooner than Portal 2.

83
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:36,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It is the releases on the PlayStation Network this week.

84
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:45,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's some pretty interesting stuff, like the Echo Chrome demo that's been released out now for, I believe, the PlayStation Portable.

85
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:53,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can also download some PlayStation 1 classics for R-Type, including R-Type 1 and R-Type 2.

86
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:56,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's available for $6.

87
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And they also have, of course, the variety map pack for Call of Duty 4 for PlayStation 3.

88
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:12,471
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you happen to be a fan of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol, Encore, they've added a variety of new songs you can check out there as well.

89
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:15,094
[SPEAKER_11]: And let's see here.

90
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:23,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, of course, the Eye of Judgment Violeth Rebellion 2 expansion set is available to download for $15.

91
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,680
[SPEAKER_11]: The typical rock band stuff.

92
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Hero 3 Deaf Leopard Pack.

93
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:30,384
[SPEAKER_11]: There's an Army of Two SSE Challenge Pack.

94
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:33,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Demo for Iron Man on the PlayStation 3.

95
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,949
[SPEAKER_11]: Resistance Fall Man 2 teaser trailer.

96
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:43,393
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's some other stuff from different game videos and stuff.

97
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:46,113
[SPEAKER_11]: and some free stuff.

98
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:53,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Eye of Judgment theme number two for free and the PlayStation 3 wallpaper for Gran Turismo 5 Prologue.

99
00:08:55,095 --> 00:09:03,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the PSP store, they're actually still selling full games on there because remember, you can download full PSP games including LocoRoco, which is $21.99.

100
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:05,457
[SPEAKER_11]: They've got, let's see here.

101
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's the only new free game.

102
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:16,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's not free, but... $21.99, that's a free deal.

103
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Free after $21.99.

104
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Free with $21.99 download fee.

105
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,377
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also Kingdom of Paradise, which is $10.99.

106
00:09:25,217 --> 00:09:26,979
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

107
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:39,507
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of sucks, though, because the money that you put into the PlayStation Store and stuff like that, it's in whole dollars, so you're stuck with these remainder cents that you get ripped off on on each purchase.

108
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus Guilty Gear

109
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:00,670
[SPEAKER_04]: This is coming to the PSP.

110
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,791
[SPEAKER_04]: They call it the most complete and balanced version of the game to date.

111
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,572
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens is that also the game is going to have an ad hoc mode.

112
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:10,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do three on three tournaments.

113
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess if you have the whole wireless thing going on.

114
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,034
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be fun.

115
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:15,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Guilty Gear.

116
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:20,495
[SPEAKER_04]: This information, by the way, coming from Famitsu Magazine, who is pretty reputable.

117
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:22,896
[SPEAKER_04]: So this game is coming out for the PSP.

118
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So good times.

119
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:25,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Guilty Gear in your pocket.

120
00:10:26,837 --> 00:10:27,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto 4

121
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:49,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know how we were chatting about that little rumor about there being a special bundle for PS3?

122
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a rumor.

123
00:10:53,095 --> 00:11:04,345
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be released on April 29th as a 40-gig unit with a 6-axis controller and stuff.

124
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:09,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, this is the European bundle, to be specific.

125
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be €4.39.

126
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:17,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you care that much about it, go get it, I guess.

127
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get it, I guess.

128
00:11:23,762 --> 00:11:26,324
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura reviews games here on Orange Launch Radio.

129
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:28,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Go get it, I guess.

130
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,133
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

131
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:49,552
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why they sell, you know, monitor adapters and stuff like that.

132
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:50,332
[SPEAKER_11]: I play on my computer monitor.

133
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:51,833
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even have a good monitor.

134
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:52,613
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

135
00:11:52,693 --> 00:11:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that little Disney... You know what?

136
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:58,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I have this Disney Princesses TV I never got a chance to use that I got for my birthday.

137
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to take that and hook something up to it?

138
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:01,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

139
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call it Dance TV.

140
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad thing is, I think she's serious.

141
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,050
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

142
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:12,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all for more DarkSakura game reviews.

143
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,753
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of karaoke.

144
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:37,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently the SingStar online store has 140,000 registered users and over 20,000 user submitted videos.

145
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,520
[SPEAKER_11]: None of which are of me because I don't own the game nor will ever own the game.

146
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,521
[SPEAKER_11]: And have been watched over 2.5 million times.

147
00:12:47,850 --> 00:13:02,295
[SPEAKER_11]: The franchise has also sold 12 million copies over its multiple iterations including SingStar Bollywood and it's due out over here next month on the 20th I believe.

148
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:06,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

149
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:09,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out, I guess.

150
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:11,737
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStar when it comes out over here.

151
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:13,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Although Loki won't be.

152
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:18,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to buy it and then get Loki drunk and then see what happens.

153
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,203
[SPEAKER_11]: If we can get him on the TV.

154
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:21,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be worth it.

155
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Listeners, let's do a quick poll in chat.

156
00:13:26,346 --> 00:13:26,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick poll.

157
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:27,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

158
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:28,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Answer the question.

159
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:36,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Y or N. Is it worth the $600 investment for a PlayStation 3 simply to upload Loki drunk karaoke to the interwebs?

160
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:38,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Y or N. You'd also have to buy a PlayStation Eye.

161
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:40,691
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

162
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:43,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worth the $650 adjustment or whatever?

163
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's throw in booze.

164
00:13:44,552 --> 00:13:45,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worth the $700 investment?

165
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:45,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

166
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:50,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to do that.

167
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:51,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Answer question.

168
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:52,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

169
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have some answers coming in already.

170
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:54,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

171
00:13:54,987 --> 00:14:11,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Y, Y, N from Cheeseburger, F and Y, so Y, hell fucking Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, lowercase Y. I think... And then we have Dora the Explorer TV is greater than Disney Princess TV.

172
00:14:11,254 --> 00:14:12,095
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't the question!

173
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:14,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Ace of Spades

174
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:44,710
[SPEAKER_04]: With some guy.

175
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll sing, but I'll make you turn around and I'll just say I'm David Cook.

176
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll get all excited.

177
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:53,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

178
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, guys, Jamie is hella into American Idol this year.

179
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:58,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hilarious.

180
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:01,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I...

181
00:15:04,741 --> 00:15:05,442
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not funny.

182
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:06,362
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's hilarious.

183
00:15:06,402 --> 00:15:07,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

184
00:15:07,343 --> 00:15:08,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it funny?

185
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:09,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's cute.

186
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:11,466
[SPEAKER_11]: They got rid of that bitch Carly, though.

187
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:12,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I like her!

188
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:15,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, shut up right now.

189
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:16,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Video game podcast.

190
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,972
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, did you listen to her old shit?

191
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:22,755
[SPEAKER_05]: She sings so much better now than she did five years ago.

192
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:23,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad.

193
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:27,198
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of that, they said that she had the best performance ever.

194
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:30,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a stupid fucking popularity contest, but David Cook is still gonna win.

195
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,422
[SPEAKER_11]: That is true.

196
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:34,794
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

197
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm changing my cage match song.

198
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:38,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you a dollar.

199
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:39,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fine.

200
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: He's great.

201
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:43,669
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

202
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:44,831
[SPEAKER_04]: They can all kiss my ass.

203
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:45,873
[SPEAKER_04]: We have games to talk about.

204
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this?

205
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:48,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

206
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:49,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?

207
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,181
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have an international story.

208
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:53,561
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.

209
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:56,102
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an international story straight out of Singapore.

210
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:57,422
[SPEAKER_05]: They caned somebody.

211
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,502
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they did not cane somebody, but I don't know.

212
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,543
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have some type of crazy outbreak here.

213
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

214
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:07,924
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a brand new rating system that has been announced in Singapore.

215
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:11,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Rating systems are overall a good thing as long as people are educated on them.

216
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,425
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the kind of weak point about it.

217
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:18,469
[SPEAKER_04]: People Like Us has identified a problem with the rating system.

218
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,834
[SPEAKER_04]: People Like Us, by the way, is a Singapore gay and lesbian group focused on advocacy and public education.

219
00:16:24,295 --> 00:16:24,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

220
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: If a game contains homosexuality, it is instantly an adult theme rating.

221
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:34,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you might have some hot girl on girl action like you have in Mass Effect.

222
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:37,084
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's a quote from People Like Us.

223
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:40,305
[SPEAKER_04]: People Like Us considers this new rule unjustifiably strict.

224
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:47,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Children should not have to be kept ignorant about the presence of gay people in society any more than they should be shielded from people of other faiths and ethnicities.

225
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:51,750
[SPEAKER_04]: The path to acceptance of gay people is through teaching children and diversity from a young age.

226
00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:00,214
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pejorative to lump gay sexual orientation with crime and drug use as the MDA's new guidelines do as if gay orientation is some kind of social threat.

227
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:12,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think it goes without saying that obviously it's kind of stupid because this is the equivalent of Brokeback Mountain is automatically an NC-17 rated movie because, you know, oh my god, butt sex, right?

228
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,830
[SPEAKER_04]: So, here's the thing.

229
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,411
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hot.

230
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing is that, okay...

231
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:25,056
[SPEAKER_04]: The even kind of bigger issue here is that, like, are there really that many games that this is going to affect?

232
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't get me wrong.

233
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:27,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree.

234
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:30,682
[SPEAKER_04]: It's stupid that this would be, you know, cause the game to get into adults only rating.

235
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:33,665
[SPEAKER_04]: But are there really that many games that are going to fall into this category?

236
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:36,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how many gay characters in games do we have?

237
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:38,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, not a lot.

238
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying that...

239
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:40,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

240
00:17:41,092 --> 00:17:56,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that we suddenly have to get all these games to come out that have OMG, a token gay in them, or a gay lead character, but I think it would be nice if in an RPG or something, and I'm not talking about Enchanted Arms and that Makoto guy, okay?

241
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even talking about that.

242
00:17:57,612 --> 00:17:58,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about, I think it would be great

243
00:17:59,594 --> 00:18:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

244
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:25,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

245
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Where?

246
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:30,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what on the internet, but I'm saying at least in their personal lives.

247
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:32,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most people are just like, whatever.

248
00:18:32,797 --> 00:18:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no big deal in this day and age anymore.

249
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,458
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just people are different.

250
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:52,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to see that same attitude in games, but I know there's some people that have that archaic attitude of, well, you know, then don't put it in Grand Theft Auto, but there's plenty of other games that would be just fine with it.

251
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:56,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Sky's voice the game.

252
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:58,978
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

253
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:06,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Seg in chat says, it's not about existing games, but it's the reason that sexuality themes are limited because of rating systems would overreact.

254
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:10,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's kind of true too, is that how often is sexuality even a factor in games?

255
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:12,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Violence, hell yeah, everywhere.

256
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:15,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Cursing, even start to see more and more.

257
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:16,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexuality?

258
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:17,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much.

259
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:26,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Because OMG boobs get you an instant auto I'm a walking MC-70 movie rating.

260
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:30,389
[SPEAKER_05]: People are sad.

261
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:31,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just silly.

262
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I would do the FUs of the week right here, but it's just, I don't know.

263
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:44,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, it's not surprising, but I think the bigger issue is there's not a lot of games that are going to fall into this category.

264
00:19:44,794 --> 00:19:46,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we work on that first?

265
00:19:49,224 --> 00:19:49,545
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

266
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:52,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can move on to your story, Jamie.

267
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:53,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's time.

268
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

269
00:19:56,693 --> 00:20:00,477
[SPEAKER_05]: The beta for Battlefield Heroes is going to be in May.

270
00:20:03,462 --> 00:20:03,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

271
00:20:04,282 --> 00:20:05,723
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is Battlefield Heroes?

272
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:06,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never even heard of this game.

273
00:20:06,763 --> 00:20:07,624
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the 6th.

274
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:13,766
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a free-to-play cartoon sort of version of an online shooting series.

275
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:18,388
[SPEAKER_05]: The ads, it's actually funded by ads, but it's not in-game.

276
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,108
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the website.

277
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:20,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so it's like a PC game.

278
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:20,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

279
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I hear cartoon, I think of Wii.

280
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:28,075
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that I had seen a little bit of it and it looks like it might be a little bit fun.

281
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:33,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thought that, especially anything that's free, I thought that people would be into it.

282
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:36,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So May 6th.

283
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Beta!

284
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:39,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

285
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I like beta and I like free games even more.

286
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:43,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Beta Max!

287
00:20:44,601 --> 00:20:48,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Another EA game that's getting a, well not really a beta, but a demo.

288
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:49,523
[SPEAKER_04]: A VHS?

289
00:20:50,143 --> 00:20:51,244
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not a VHS.

290
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:51,944
[SPEAKER_04]: A Laserdisc?

291
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Spore Creature Creator and Demo

292
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,182
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there's like a SimCity pack or Sims pack coming out.

293
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:21,849
[SPEAKER_11]: That'll be a part of that, as well as, well, if you don't want to purchase it as part of that, you can also get the, I guess, demo for $9.99.

294
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,834
[SPEAKER_11]: And what the Creature Creator will allow you to do is create creatures, obviously.

295
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:31,897
[SPEAKER_11]: You can export those creatures to wallpapers and stuff like that.

296
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:36,660
[SPEAKER_11]: So, plus, I guess the creatures can be used in the full game when that actually finally comes out.

297
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:38,662
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's kind of sad?

298
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:38,762
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

299
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I, like, forgot about Spore.

300
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:45,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember I was so hyped about this game after we saw that one demo at E3 in, like, what, 2005?

301
00:21:46,396 --> 00:21:49,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, like, so hyped up for Spore, right?

302
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:50,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of forgot about Spore.

303
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,722
[SPEAKER_04]: They might as well just rename this game Spore Chinese Democracy.

304
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the next PC game I'm gonna buy.

305
00:21:55,704 --> 00:22:04,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean... Because I don't really... Well, the last game I bought, and I didn't really technically buy it because I got it for free, was Crysis.

306
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,073
[SPEAKER_11]: It came with my graphics card.

307
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:06,694
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

308
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,870
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

309
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Ragnarok 2, maybe.

310
00:22:38,771 --> 00:22:40,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So your games have to come from Korea.

311
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Korea.

312
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:51,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't mind having an updated Sonic R. Rock Band is a game we all own and love and play on the internet.

313
00:22:51,596 --> 00:22:53,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually playing a little bit of Rock Band this week.

314
00:22:53,477 --> 00:22:57,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing with our webmaster VXJasonXV and Raichan.

315
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing with them and sadly, Xbox, well...

316
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,182
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

317
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:29,022
[SPEAKER_04]: which are from Chico, California.

318
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:30,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that because I used to live there.

319
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:33,645
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's kind of funny that now they're having all this success through a video game.

320
00:23:33,665 --> 00:23:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: But there you have Red Tandy and Time Sick Son of a Grizzly Bear from the Mother Hipps.

321
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:40,049
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they still play at Brickworks.

322
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:40,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

323
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,750
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is coming.

324
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: at some point to Rock Band.

325
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be next Tuesday, actually.

326
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,756
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Smashing Pumpkins, you know them.

327
00:23:48,816 --> 00:23:49,997
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a song already in the game.

328
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:51,619
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, what, Cherub Rock is in the game.

329
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,342
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you can download Zero, which has some pretty awesome guitar.

330
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:56,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that song, Zero?

331
00:23:57,824 --> 00:24:00,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, props to you if you can sing like Billy Corgan.

332
00:24:00,847 --> 00:24:01,007
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

333
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he's got something going on.

334
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sad when a man can sing higher than me.

335
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:08,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Billy Corgan is sadly not David Cook, is he?

336
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:08,994
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

337
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:09,374
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

338
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:10,095
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

339
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the mailbag.

340
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we encourage you guys to send us some emails.

341
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangelaundry.com is the place to do it.

342
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:23,595
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura will dive into the email bag every week, but she wears plastic gloves when she does it because she doesn't want anthrax poisoning.

343
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:25,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthrax was an 80s band, not a poison.

344
00:24:28,123 --> 00:24:30,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here it is, our mailbag segment.

345
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,345
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, read some emails.

346
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:36,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Crap, crap, crap, crap done.

347
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:36,648
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

348
00:24:36,868 --> 00:24:38,168
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got a lot of crap this week?

349
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:42,431
[SPEAKER_05]: No, although some underage girl wanted to show me her private pictures.

350
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:44,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn that spam.

351
00:24:44,512 --> 00:24:44,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

352
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:45,893
[SPEAKER_11]: That's supposed to be coming to me.

353
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:51,256
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not going to say it.

354
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:51,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

355
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:54,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, guys!

356
00:24:54,818 --> 00:25:01,523
[SPEAKER_05]: On the show before last, Rob said Live365, idiots, charged him after he sent two emails saying he quit.

357
00:25:02,183 --> 00:25:05,025
[SPEAKER_05]: He said he would give us an update on it last week and never did.

358
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,327
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question is, what's going on with that?

359
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:11,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I have been listening since episode 150 and I still don't know why Loki hates Tingle.

360
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:12,671
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

361
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:13,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I attached a picture.

362
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:14,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I was bored.

363
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:15,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Misspelled.

364
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:17,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's it from?

365
00:25:17,995 --> 00:25:21,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a little picture of Tingle with Loki's face on it and it says Loki.

366
00:25:23,209 --> 00:25:24,693
[SPEAKER_11]: How wonderful.

367
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:27,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's from Eichen House Cheeseburger.

368
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I can ask Cheeseburger.

369
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:29,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

370
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I did forget to give the Live 365 update because it's kind of funny what happened.

371
00:25:32,674 --> 00:25:41,162
[SPEAKER_04]: You might remember I was really pissed because they charged my credit card, and it was a little unfair of me to not give the follow-up, so I apologize to them.

372
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:47,127
[SPEAKER_04]: But strangely enough, that next Monday, mysteriously, with no email, well, no, I did get an email.

373
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:54,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little email in my inbox that says, Rob, we have processed the cancellation, and they refunded my credit card, the entire money.

374
00:25:57,318 --> 00:25:58,759
[SPEAKER_04]: They did not end up stealing the money for me.

375
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:01,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It was only out of my bank account for a couple of days.

376
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,003
[SPEAKER_04]: They borrowed it for a couple of days.

377
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:05,365
[SPEAKER_05]: They poked it and did experiments.

378
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:09,930
[SPEAKER_04]: The strange thing is we got a little bit of kickback from our VIP listenership.

379
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,732
[SPEAKER_04]: The more VIPs that we had listening to us on Live 365, we got some kickback.

380
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:14,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, guys, it was nothing.

381
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got like $1.37 from the month of May.

382
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,718
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm sorry, month of March.

383
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,742
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually got refunded that $1.37 back as well.

384
00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:31,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually did get a little bit of interest, I guess you could say, thanks to our VIP listeners, who I do feel bad for that we're not on Live 365 anymore.

385
00:26:31,868 --> 00:26:33,889
[SPEAKER_04]: But all games, it's where it's at, yo.

386
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where it's at.

387
00:26:37,152 --> 00:26:37,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Live in the now.

388
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:44,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Sauce says that Poison was also an 80s band, Rob.

389
00:26:45,097 --> 00:26:45,537
[SPEAKER_04]: That is true.

390
00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:48,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Anthrax is poison and poison was also an 80s band.

391
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:48,780
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

392
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Titsuya said the exact same thing in chat.

393
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:51,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Great minds think alike.

394
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:52,663
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of freaky.

395
00:26:53,243 --> 00:26:54,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what my husband says.

396
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:56,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Great minds think like us.

397
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, describe your hatred of Tingle.

398
00:26:58,647 --> 00:27:00,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it you hate Tingle so damn much?

399
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he's a stupid character.

400
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:02,770
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

401
00:27:03,851 --> 00:27:04,471
[SPEAKER_11]: He was annoying.

402
00:27:04,511 --> 00:27:06,392
[SPEAKER_11]: He was annoying in Wind Waker.

403
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,936
[SPEAKER_11]: This fascination with everybody for me to do Tingle's voice.

404
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:11,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

405
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:12,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just retarded.

406
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:13,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it one night, yes.

407
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:15,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people don't know when to let a joke go.

408
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,279
[SPEAKER_04]: This email is from someone in Australia, I believe.

409
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:32,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So... Crikey!

410
00:27:32,913 --> 00:27:33,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

411
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:37,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been listening for the past six months on podcasts and have been enjoying it.

412
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:43,095
[SPEAKER_05]: It breaks up the ride to and from work so I'm not bored just looking at the window seeing the same thing every day.

413
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:46,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't listen live as it's in the middle of Monday and I'm at work.

414
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Only have been live once.

415
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,518
[SPEAKER_05]: The changeover to all games has been good.

416
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:54,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed the upgrade in audio from the first second.

417
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad to see you've left dead 365.

418
00:27:59,747 --> 00:28:03,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually do want to point out the change in audio has nothing to do with our all-games move.

419
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:05,589
[SPEAKER_04]: The live change in audio, yes.

420
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:17,313
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast change in audio was just a decision that we just did, we went through with, and that is that we used to be encoded in 56k stereo, but honestly, how much music have we been playing on this show?

421
00:28:17,373 --> 00:28:17,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot.

422
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:24,975
[SPEAKER_04]: So we downgrade, we actually downgraded to mono, but we went to 64k mono, and that, there's a lot of difference there in the sound quality.

423
00:28:25,276 --> 00:28:26,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds really good.

424
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:33,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Mario Kart Wii quite a bit over the past few months and I found out something that Rob won't like too much.

425
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:37,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry to tell you, Rob, but Toadette is an unlockable character on Mario Kart Wii.

426
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:41,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for everything and keep up the good work.

427
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Long live the ferret.

428
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:48,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I was trying to get to.

429
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:51,453
[SPEAKER_05]: And this email is also sponsored by the Olive Garden.

430
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, no never-ending breadsticks here in Australia.

431
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:54,535
[SPEAKER_06]: What?! !

432
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,236
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to start a riot.

433
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:03,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf's in chat, our old buddy who airs an hour before us.

434
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,422
[SPEAKER_04]: He is actually taking credit for the sound upgrade.

435
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:08,505
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, no, actually, all games is responsible for this change, too.

436
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:09,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't believe Rob.

437
00:29:09,345 --> 00:29:13,028
[SPEAKER_04]: We were like, you can't come unless you're in 64K mono.

438
00:29:13,068 --> 00:29:13,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.

439
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:14,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob.

440
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:15,450
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

441
00:29:15,911 --> 00:29:16,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

442
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:16,511
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

443
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

444
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:17,792
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

445
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,414
[SPEAKER_05]: On May 1st, let's go to Olive Garden.

446
00:29:21,155 --> 00:29:21,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

447
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still on the low-fat diet until at least...

448
00:29:25,424 --> 00:29:25,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

449
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:26,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

450
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:27,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then we can go on May 1st.

451
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:33,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I will personally look over their menu and pick out the crap that is low-fat.

452
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a diet menu anywhere.

453
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I've learned.

454
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in Vegas on May 1st.

455
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go with the Food Network again.

456
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:41,374
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's a quick thing.

457
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:46,897
[SPEAKER_04]: If the listeners that have been listening for a couple months know that I have issues in my pancreas, I'm on a very strict low-fat diet because of it.

458
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:48,038
[SPEAKER_04]: I should put that in my cage.

459
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:49,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Until at least May 9th.

460
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:50,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing is that...

461
00:29:53,355 --> 00:30:02,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of the thing I've learned, like I went to Ruby Tuesdays this week with some of my co-workers that were visiting from LA, and they were getting the spinach dip and the avocado dip, and they were like, mmm, this is so good.

462
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:03,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry, Rob.

463
00:30:03,781 --> 00:30:04,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry you can't eat this.

464
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:06,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So I learned that they have a diet menu.

465
00:30:06,863 --> 00:30:08,284
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I ate at Ruby Tuesdays?

466
00:30:08,304 --> 00:30:08,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice little fat.

467
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate an unflavored piece of cooked chicken and broccoli.

468
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:13,607
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my dinner.

469
00:30:14,788 --> 00:30:15,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoop-de-hoo!

470
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:17,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Well...

471
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:29,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that also part of... I think that, you know, possibly the... You didn't ask if it's all the fats or if it's just saturated.

472
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:30,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturates.

473
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:30,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all fat.

474
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:31,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's any fat.

475
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:32,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

476
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:33,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't have fat.

477
00:30:33,238 --> 00:30:33,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't have caffeine.

478
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:34,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't have carbonation.

479
00:30:34,478 --> 00:30:35,399
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't digest vitamin E now.

480
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:36,179
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible.

481
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,380
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot digest vitamin E.

482
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:42,167
[SPEAKER_04]: May 5th marks one month since I got out of the hospital, but here's the thing.

483
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:51,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I had Thai food last night in San Francisco that I thought was going to be healthy for me, and I think I overindulged a little bit because my chest was hurting last night, and that's not a good sign.

484
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,656
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really worried.

485
00:30:53,676 --> 00:30:54,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to have this forever.

486
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, OL Foodio is over.

487
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back to the email.

488
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Foodio.

489
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:02,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

490
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:03,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR.

491
00:31:03,953 --> 00:31:08,056
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, a big F you to Nintendo for giving a mandatory update with Super Smash Bros.

492
00:31:08,096 --> 00:31:11,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Brawl, so now I permanently have Photo Channel 1.1.

493
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:20,203
[SPEAKER_05]: This means I need to make M4A files to listen to music on Photo Channel, which means I'll have to delete my MP3 files for one of my favorite racing games, Excite Truck.

494
00:31:20,363 --> 00:31:22,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I love the game as much as you do You Are Not Alone.

495
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:29,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, would you buy anything with the word strip before the title if it were on Xbox Live Arcade?

496
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:30,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

497
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:30,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

498
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:33,269
[SPEAKER_05]: What if it's strip mine?

499
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,451
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I keep thinking of.

500
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:39,432
[SPEAKER_04]: What if it's, you know, strip racing?

501
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:40,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Or strip paint.

502
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, where you go to the wall and put turpentine and shit.

503
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:49,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Third, are you looking forward to any WiiWare games when the service comes out next week?

504
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:59,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like Defend Your Castle way more than I ought to, so I'll probably buy Defend Your Castle on the Wii, because that game is so much freaking hilarity on the PC.

505
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:00,783
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I know it's been out for years.

506
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:03,357
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want.

507
00:32:03,377 --> 00:32:03,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, man.

508
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:12,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

509
00:32:12,284 --> 00:32:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room wants to let our emailer know Blackwolf is saying he can just delete the 1.1 channel and Actdeft is going to post a link in chat.

510
00:32:19,986 --> 00:32:22,226
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a way you can downgrade the photo channel from 1.1.

511
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,367
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get rid of that if you want to go back to the old one.

512
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:28,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably you can Google it since you're not a live listener, it sounds like.

513
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:30,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this the same guy from Australia?

514
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,629
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is Katamari's Forever.

515
00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:35,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well shit, Katamari's Forever I think is in chat right now.

516
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did they leave?

517
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think they left.

518
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:40,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, poor thing, because they're about to get a link in chat.

519
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,928
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they happen to be listening to the podcast, I'm sure it's out there somewhere.

520
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoot us a message.

521
00:32:45,571 --> 00:32:46,112
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find it.

522
00:32:46,252 --> 00:32:54,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft is posting a link from Joystick, the blog with a joystick with a Q. It was posted on December 13th of last year, if you want to go find it.

523
00:32:57,824 --> 00:33:00,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, I recently bought Night's Journey of Dreams.

524
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:06,093
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cool and very cute game, but it suffers from simplicity.

525
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:10,538
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the voice acting is top-notch, and it sort of alludes to Eternity's Child.

526
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:14,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to see you at the Olive Garden when the Endless Pasta deal comes back.

527
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,782
[SPEAKER_05]: and the Knights has always been simplistic in play.

528
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:30,046
[SPEAKER_05]: However, having upgraded, you know, better voice acting is really good because the Saturn version is like, and Claris decided that she was going to go out.

529
00:33:30,086 --> 00:33:35,028
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they took one of their secretaries who just happened to speak English and say, here, do this.

530
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:36,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

531
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, it had the same bad voice acting in Japan.

532
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, that's probably how it happened.

533
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I went and found it.

534
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:43,713
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

535
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:46,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did DarkSakura get the ferret?

536
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't listened for that long, and I'd like to know of its origins.

537
00:33:49,346 --> 00:33:49,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks again.

538
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,472
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my ferret, but I have adopted it as my baby.

539
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:59,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say this week on the Wikia, I posted a huge... I went to the Wikia to clear up two questions that were being asked to me.

540
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:00,578
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was the ferret.

541
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the ferret article was wrong, so I went and posted a big old thing in the talk section, so you can go read that.

542
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:09,684
[SPEAKER_04]: And also on the Wikia, how OLR got its name.

543
00:34:10,044 --> 00:34:16,148
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya wanted me to post a thing about that, so I posted a big old thing on that, including why we named it that, and so on and so on.

544
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:22,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft is also pointing a step-by-step.

545
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,703
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually went and got a bullet point list of how you downgrade the photo channel.

546
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:26,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.

547
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:38,374
[SPEAKER_04]: From the main menu, go into the Wii button, select Data Management, select Channels, then select Photo Channel 1.1, confirm you want to delete it.

548
00:34:38,694 --> 00:34:40,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Photo Channel 1.0 will return.

549
00:34:40,916 --> 00:34:41,376
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

550
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff.

551
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:45,100
[SPEAKER_05]: A long email.

552
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:46,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh lord.

553
00:34:46,245 --> 00:34:46,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Dun dun dun.

554
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:47,245
[SPEAKER_04]: From who?

555
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:49,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess who it's from.

556
00:34:49,146 --> 00:34:49,506
[SPEAKER_04]: From who?

557
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,127
[SPEAKER_05]: It is from Rolf Steel UT.

558
00:34:52,287 --> 00:34:53,468
[SPEAKER_04]: He must be listening tonight.

559
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,068
[SPEAKER_04]: He must have heard the thing earlier, didn't he?

560
00:34:55,848 --> 00:34:56,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

561
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:57,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

562
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, read however much you want to.

563
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys!

564
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:07,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm a girl, so you should clarify too.

565
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:10,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys and girl.

566
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:11,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, baby.

567
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:12,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

568
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:15,764
[SPEAKER_04]: You really wanted him to start emailing?

569
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:16,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, baby.

570
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:17,265
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

571
00:35:17,846 --> 00:35:18,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just being silly.

572
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:22,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, the heat in here is giving me a freaking migraine.

573
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:24,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you're sitting right by the fan.

574
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:24,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to tell you.

575
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:25,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

576
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have a migraine.

577
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And the box fan is broke.

578
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:28,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, come on.

579
00:35:28,434 --> 00:35:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the email.

580
00:35:28,934 --> 00:35:29,795
[SPEAKER_05]: He broke the box.

581
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:34,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because I can't get on the chat anymore doesn't mean I can't participate.

582
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, unban him, okay?

583
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:40,036
[SPEAKER_05]: My official decree is to freaking unban him.

584
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:40,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So do it.

585
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:42,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

586
00:35:42,957 --> 00:35:43,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Now.

587
00:35:44,157 --> 00:35:45,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you have it.

588
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd probably say more things that DMN and other game pirates don't like in these emails, but what are they gonna do?

589
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:52,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Ban me?

590
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:54,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugh.

591
00:35:57,054 --> 00:36:03,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I wanted to start by talking about light gun games on consoles, particularly games that use limited continues.

592
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:10,648
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with console ports of arcade shooters is that, by and large, they're very vanilla ports without much consideration for the home consoles.

593
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:19,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, you need to get the arcade mode in there, give people the option of free play, but in order to give a balanced experience, it feels like it's...

594
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:23,044
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

595
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:53,732
[SPEAKER_05]: have been released recently to show a way for console light gun games to work.

596
00:36:54,052 --> 00:36:57,657
[SPEAKER_05]: First, we have time crises for complete mission mode.

597
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:05,468
[SPEAKER_05]: In between the FPS stages, players will play through the arcade stages, but there is a difference in how they work versus the arcade mode.

598
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:10,089
[SPEAKER_05]: The player starts each stage with four units of life regardless of their health at the end of the previous stage.

599
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Upon death, the stage starts at the very beginning.

600
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:15,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They can, however, retry as many times as they like.

601
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:20,993
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes the game challenging without being a cheap exercise in credit draining.

602
00:37:21,713 --> 00:37:23,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Another game is Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles.

603
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:31,857
[SPEAKER_05]: This game has a checkpoint at the center of the stage and at the final boss, and items found in the game can be used immediately or stored for later use.

604
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:38,724
[SPEAKER_05]: One can only hope that more light gun games will provide more robust experiences.

605
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:39,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he use robust?

606
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:45,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Because just the arcade game isn't enough.

607
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:47,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you can't spell robust without Rob.

608
00:37:48,094 --> 00:37:48,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Or bust.

609
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:51,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Like robo-bust.

610
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:53,279
[SPEAKER_04]: More email.

611
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:53,980
[SPEAKER_04]: More email!

612
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine!

613
00:37:55,794 --> 00:38:01,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, I saw something on Kotaku regarding the obscene amount of time it takes to quit the PC versions of Assassin's Creed.

614
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,961
[SPEAKER_05]: It took a full minute to quit the game using the in-game menus.

615
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:20,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, you can control alt delete and quit that way, but seeing just how asinine the in-game quit ordeal is really cast doubt over Ubi's willingness to cater to the PC crowd, especially with the continued downfall of the PC as a mainstream gaming platform, i.e.

616
00:38:20,633 --> 00:38:23,235
[SPEAKER_05]: retail games and not ad-supported casual stuff.

617
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:35,562
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's at kotaku.com slash 384339 slash assassins-creed-i-can't-quit-you I think that's pretty freaking funny.

618
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:44,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, I have to talk about the Perfect 10 review IGN gave GTA 4, which was coincidentally an exclusive first review.

619
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:50,878
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, one has to question the ethical integrity of an exclusive review.

620
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,460
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't hear about exclusive music or movie previews.

621
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,801
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't happen.

622
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:56,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

623
00:38:56,421 --> 00:39:02,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the music and movie reviews tend to have more integrity than much of the gaming enthusiast media.

624
00:39:03,163 --> 00:39:15,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed, I've never seen an exclusive review that wasn't a glowing puff piece for the game in question.

625
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:24,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reviewer in this case made it obvious with hyperbole like calling it the best game in a decade and proclaiming it to be perfect.

626
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:31,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I can imagine the guy writing the review on his knees while his mouth was otherwise occupied.

627
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:51,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Considering Loki's criticism of the soundtrack, Jamie's complete disinterest in the boring monotony, and both Loki and Rob saying that the cheats are what make GTA fun, it really looks like Rockstar is buying reviews, or at least like many reviewers are mystified by the uber-popular franchise and not wanting to believe they're even the slightest thing wrong with it.

628
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:53,690
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

629
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to jump in here.

630
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:03,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually really agree with what he's saying here because I think it is absolute bullshit that IGN gets this exclusive review and coincidentally it gets a 10 out of 10.

631
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:12,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think we all knew Grand Theft Auto was going to get stellar reviews across the board, but quite frankly, IGN's word is tarnished, period, from this.

632
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

633
00:40:32,273 --> 00:40:32,613
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

634
00:40:32,993 --> 00:40:35,954
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole rating system is kind of skewed anyways.

635
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:39,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And really what you need to do is just ignore the ratings and just read what they write.

636
00:40:39,975 --> 00:40:44,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they'll explain in the review that it's not perfect and that there's issues and stuff.

637
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,437
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really what you need to take.

638
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:47,797
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't buy your game based off of a number review.

639
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:48,878
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, you know...

640
00:40:50,038 --> 00:40:57,421
[SPEAKER_11]: If you scored a B on a test or something, what's more important, the fact that you scored a B or why you scored a B on the test?

641
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:02,143
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what's more important, I would think, to an individual.

642
00:41:02,163 --> 00:41:04,644
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other thing, too, is a lot of people are skewed.

643
00:41:04,665 --> 00:41:07,026
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of Grand Theft Auto fanboys out there.

644
00:41:07,886 --> 00:41:13,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be first to say I love the game, and I absolutely think it's not perfect, but it's...

645
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:16,279
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you expect?

646
00:41:16,379 --> 00:41:23,121
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically as much of a jump from Grand Theft Auto 3 to 4 as it was from 2 to 3.

647
00:41:24,162 --> 00:41:25,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was pretty big.

648
00:41:26,642 --> 00:41:27,002
[SPEAKER_11]: It's great.

649
00:41:27,183 --> 00:41:28,083
[SPEAKER_11]: It's where it needs to go.

650
00:41:28,163 --> 00:41:28,863
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what?

651
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:35,265
[SPEAKER_11]: When they do come out with the next Vice City or whatever that is using the same engine, it's going to be that much better.

652
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:36,625
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

653
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,106
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah.

654
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Exclusive anything's retarded.

655
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:41,347
[SPEAKER_01]: There was more to that paragraph.

656
00:41:43,655 --> 00:41:55,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The lack of balls in mainstream gaming media is frighteningly familiar to anyone who remembers the gaming industry crash of 1983 when people stopped buying video games in general because even shitty games were getting glowing reviews.

657
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:03,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully the growth of independent media such as All Games Radio will stem the tide of consumer distrust before the industry explodes.

658
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:17,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Lastly, while the Nintendo Wii is still selling like crazy, attach rates are still lower than either other console, and third parties are increasingly looking at the Wii as nothing more than a disposable toy.

659
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:26,406
[SPEAKER_05]: GameStop can't keep Wiis in stock but have huge piles of accessories, and the only consistent sellers are Wii Play and Nintendo mascot games.

660
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:28,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo can make all the money they want,

661
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:34,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree that they haven't really expanded much beyond... I mean, because they were trying to get out of the whole rut that, you know, the GameCube is just a game for kids.

662
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:37,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the fact that they're releasing kid games, you know, all across... And I...

663
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so they released Metroid Prime 3, but big deal.

664
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,798
[SPEAKER_11]: One game out of, you know, I don't know how many they've made.

665
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,121
[SPEAKER_11]: That doesn't really count.

666
00:43:09,304 --> 00:43:17,848
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, they are targeting, you know, the casual player and stuff with these, you know, like Wii Fit and, you know, just the Wii console and Wii Sports and everything.

667
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:21,489
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, yeah, there's a lot of people that will buy it just for Wii Sports and that's it.

668
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:28,972
[SPEAKER_11]: And they've sold, you know, they profited from that maybe about $10, you know, because they're probably making some money off each console, but that's it.

669
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:34,895
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, then they're getting people to buy accessories and stuff and there's, you know, a lot of markup there too, so...

670
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:36,881
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just retarded.

671
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:57,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to remember, not that I'm trying to make excuses for the Wii, because the Wii certainly has its shortcomings, especially as we've kind of moved on a year past its launch and so on, or almost two years getting there, is that the Wii doesn't lose money with every sale, whereas PlayStation 3 loses quite a bit of money, and Xbox 360 I think now about breaks even, but when it was first out, it was losing money too.

672
00:43:57,671 --> 00:44:00,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to sell more games to kind of make a profit.

673
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,493
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nintendo Wii, they're profiting right out the gate.

674
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:07,654
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of like Loki says, you just buy it for Wii Sports, there's still a profit to be made.

675
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:19,658
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think as long as Nintendo puts out those one, two games a year that you just have to freaking have, the soccer moms, and I think Wii Fit is this year's, it's still going to be a big deal.

676
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:25,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it's just a different audience than the hardcore gamer.

677
00:44:26,321 --> 00:44:30,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So if Nintendo wants to appeal to the hardcore gamer, I guess we get Metroid Prime 3.

678
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:32,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart's not bad.

679
00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some of those games.

680
00:44:35,588 --> 00:44:39,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my problem with Nintendo is I don't think they get the market still.

681
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:49,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though they may... In theory, tapping parts of the market that haven't been tapped before, like the casual gamer and stuff...

682
00:44:51,158 --> 00:44:55,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you shouldn't be tapping that market because it's not profitable for you.

683
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,221
[SPEAKER_11]: You're selling tons of consoles, but these people aren't buying games.

684
00:44:58,461 --> 00:45:00,002
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also the same problem with Sony.

685
00:45:00,062 --> 00:45:03,664
[SPEAKER_11]: You're selling a PlayStation 3 as a Blu-ray player.

686
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, these people may not buy games either.

687
00:45:06,145 --> 00:45:11,267
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you're losing money on that sale, but you're not necessarily making it up in Blu-ray sales.

688
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:14,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind also, Nintendo is a Japanese company.

689
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft is an American company.

690
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:24,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And while, yes, Sony is a Japanese company as well, you kind of get the feeling that there's a little bit of tug of war going on between their American and Japanese arms as to, you know, who's controlling the PlayStation 3.

691
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,621
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

692
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:26,361
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

693
00:45:27,515 --> 00:45:33,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something else to consider as well, because definitely you have a vastly different audience when you talk about the Japanese gaming audience and the American gaming audience.

694
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:36,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look at any top ten chart from a week, and there you have it.

695
00:45:36,697 --> 00:45:44,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And, I mean, the same, I guess, could be said for the DS, because the Nintendo-made games tend to sell very well, and it's starting to come around for third-party stuff.

696
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:51,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's going to come around eventually for the Wii as well, because, I mean, the Wii's only been out for, you know, not that long, so...

697
00:45:53,004 --> 00:46:01,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, sure, there's a ton of crappy ports, just like there was a ton of crappy Xbox ports for the Xbox 360 when it first came out.

698
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:06,638
[SPEAKER_11]: And there was a ton of crappy PlayStation 1 ports for the PlayStation 2 when it first came out.

699
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:11,223
[SPEAKER_11]: But Fantavision... Fantavision was fun.

700
00:46:11,384 --> 00:46:12,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I liked Fantavision.

701
00:46:13,165 --> 00:46:13,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

702
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,026
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, stuff will get better.

703
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:22,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And people, unfortunately, you know, people understand that there are shovelware games out there.

704
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:23,169
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

705
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:24,869
[SPEAKER_11]: The best thing you can do is just not buy them.

706
00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:28,191
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, granted, there are stupid people that will buy them, but that's fine.

707
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:28,991
[SPEAKER_11]: That's who they're catered to.

708
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:31,792
[SPEAKER_04]: There will always be the Walmart crowd that buys them because they're cheap.

709
00:46:32,052 --> 00:46:32,613
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's fine.

710
00:46:33,053 --> 00:46:34,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Those companies are there.

711
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:42,057
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's pretty funny, though, because we had some of the publishers out, and there were some publishers that deal in specifically...

712
00:46:42,937 --> 00:47:10,102
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to say it was Destiny but I'm not sure but they're a company that dealt with like really small games that you know didn't really do that well and they understand where their market is they understand that they're not trying to compete with like Grand Theft Auto they're competing you know they're basically just putting them out there because they sell and that's it so you know they understand that their games aren't that quality but they accept them for what they are so it's just people that are dumb and buy them

713
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:11,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

714
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:12,434
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the end of the email.

715
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:13,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any more emails?

716
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,042
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

717
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:15,624
[SPEAKER_05]: There were two more.

718
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:16,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

719
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:18,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR.

720
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:19,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope Sky and the Ferret are okay.

721
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:26,907
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought I'd say that since I started to listen to OLR episode 245, the show has changed so much.

722
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,288
[SPEAKER_05]: New cam, new studio, and the all games move.

723
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:31,189
[SPEAKER_05]: OLR is just getting bigger and better.

724
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:31,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Congrats.

725
00:47:32,529 --> 00:47:41,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I should be live for once as I live in the UK, so keep an eye out as it won't happen again for a while.

726
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:43,273
[SPEAKER_05]: That's from Lycan that's in the chat room right now.

727
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:44,154
[SPEAKER_04]: They are in chat.

728
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:44,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

729
00:47:45,402 --> 00:47:46,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email!

730
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:49,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say, that person did kind of put it into perspective.

731
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:53,371
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a lot of changes to the show just in the past year, so it's pretty exciting.

732
00:47:54,892 --> 00:47:55,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon the world.

733
00:47:58,256 --> 00:47:59,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Last email.

734
00:47:59,718 --> 00:48:00,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Dun dun dun.

735
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:02,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, OLR.

736
00:48:03,158 --> 00:48:06,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been really bored because I forced myself to stop Crysis.

737
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:10,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing other games right now, like Ragnarok 2, but I think it hates Vista.

738
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:11,670
[SPEAKER_05]: What doesn't?

739
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:15,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So it gives me a BSOD, to translate, a blue screen of death.

740
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:46,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Diz were good.

741
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,074
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 was great.

742
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:53,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I played 12 and I did not like the battle system at all.

743
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,316
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people up and down screaming, you gotta get Persona 3.

744
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:57,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Persona 3.

745
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:02,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, uh... Disgaea, if you like tactical games.

746
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:02,479
[SPEAKER_05]: What was...

747
00:49:05,874 --> 00:49:15,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to think of what the... It's not really an RPG, but the Fatal Frame games were getting some... have a little bit of a fan following behind them, too.

748
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,882
[SPEAKER_05]: This is from Sakura Max, Dragging Misery Into My Life.

749
00:49:20,103 --> 00:49:23,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope all the idiots who exist in my life would just go away.

750
00:49:23,766 --> 00:49:25,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm not going to read the rest of that.

751
00:49:25,227 --> 00:49:25,567
[SPEAKER_05]: That's emo.

752
00:49:25,627 --> 00:49:25,947
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

753
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:26,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Strip Lounge Radio.

754
00:49:27,608 --> 00:49:28,048
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.S.

755
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:28,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

756
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:29,870
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than Crisis.

757
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:31,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Indeed.

758
00:49:31,891 --> 00:49:32,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It is better than Crisis.

759
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:34,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're done with emails.

760
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:37,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Yar.

761
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:38,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yar.

762
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:39,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

763
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I got one more mention from RawSteelUT.

764
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:45,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how long is it?

765
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:46,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Not long.

766
00:49:46,622 --> 00:49:47,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, hurry.

767
00:49:47,742 --> 00:49:51,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry guys, but with my banning from chat, I can't respond fast to the topics I like.

768
00:49:52,183 --> 00:49:53,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some quick things though.

769
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:57,563
[SPEAKER_05]: In the US, fansubbing is still illegal as it violates the original rights holders.

770
00:49:57,623 --> 00:49:59,744
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, Japanese anime makers.

771
00:50:00,124 --> 00:50:05,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Companies like Media Factory Incorporated have sent cease and desist orders to torrent sites carrying fansubs of their anime.

772
00:50:06,445 --> 00:50:24,122
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've seen an increase in recent years of pre-licensed anime such as Ghost of the Shell Standalone Complex and some cases even funded in part by US companies like ADV and Manga Entertainment Japanese companies are obviously discontent with fansubbers as they devalue a license and are also available for Japanese users the internet being what it is

773
00:50:25,443 --> 00:50:32,190
[SPEAKER_05]: JSRAC is a company formed by such anime companies and have frequently had problems with YouTube over the fans of content in their service.

774
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:40,778
[SPEAKER_05]: As for the sequel to Rival Schools, while it is still called Project Justice Rival Schools 2 in Latin American Europe, the subtitle Rival Schools 2 was removed from the American, I knew that.

775
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:47,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Presumably not to cause controversy two years after the Columbine Massacre in Japan, it was referred to as Moru Justice Gakuen, which is what I said.

776
00:50:48,526 --> 00:50:55,244
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's the name I still mostly refer to it by because I had the Japanese version for a long long time so yeah

777
00:50:56,979 --> 00:51:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Meanwhile, more gaming news!

778
00:51:02,623 --> 00:51:05,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there's going to be a brand new game.

779
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:06,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, this looks pretty awesome.

780
00:51:07,066 --> 00:51:10,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got one on order for myself and I'm not really into racing games.

781
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:14,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Grid, the brand new game from Codemasters.

782
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:19,614
[SPEAKER_11]: You may remember them doing Dirt, which is a pretty well-accepted game.

783
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:24,958
[SPEAKER_11]: This time, it's going to be all street racing, well, street circuits and that kind of stuff.

784
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:36,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It is pretty cool though, they're going to have integration with eBay Motors, so you can actually, I guess, sell vehicles that you have created in-game through eBay.

785
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how that's actually going to work, though, if you're going to have to pay real money for it.

786
00:51:42,712 --> 00:51:47,854
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, well, it's going to allow players to buy and sell in-game vehicles in a realistic setting.

787
00:51:48,914 --> 00:51:56,097
[SPEAKER_11]: And it says also they're going to have different eBay-sponsored races, like the eBay Motor Muscle Series.

788
00:51:58,138 --> 00:52:04,481
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to have, let's see, some other concept cars and stuff like that with eBay stuff plastered all over it.

789
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:06,971
[SPEAKER_11]: I could find out.

790
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:26,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

791
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Ticket Redemption Games and Illegal Gambling

792
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:00,776
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not what you think.

793
00:53:01,237 --> 00:53:01,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.

794
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:05,020
[SPEAKER_04]: The sponsor of the bill, he calls it the Chuck E. Cheese Bill.

795
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:12,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And what it is is that right now, a game like skee-ball or a type of video game, it might violate the law.

796
00:53:12,446 --> 00:53:19,192
[SPEAKER_04]: However, what he wants to do is he actually wants to clearly state that these games do not violate the gambling law, that they're okay.

797
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:23,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's actually, you know, usually when we talk about, you know,

798
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:25,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Game-related bills going into effect.

799
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:54,871
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't change the fact, though, that these games at Chuck E. Cheese is one thing, but these games having taken over my favorite arcades of yesteryear are another, and it kind of ticks me off.

800
00:53:54,951 --> 00:54:05,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys, but I'm a little bit pissed off that Ticket Redemption games have overtaken arcades I used to know and love and shut other ones out of business, and hence that's why I think it's time to do the FUs of the week.

801
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:40,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my, uh, FU is, uh, to these stupid people, and I know I always do talk about, you know, traffic and stupid people driving, but this couple in a big mini, it's not really mini, it's just a van.

802
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:43,062
[SPEAKER_05]: We're turning around where you cannot do a U-turn.

803
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:46,404
[SPEAKER_05]: And so turned into the next street and did a wide loop.

804
00:54:46,485 --> 00:54:50,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, fuck you, you have to wait since they're technically in a right-hand turning lane now.

805
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And I went and honked at them quite loudly.

806
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:54,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid bitch.

807
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, F you to the heat.

808
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:02,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not very hot right now and it was really nice outside, but the sun specifically.

809
00:55:03,636 --> 00:55:04,696
[SPEAKER_05]: F you, sun!

810
00:55:04,716 --> 00:55:07,478
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to get a really big rock and throw it at the sun.

811
00:55:07,498 --> 00:55:10,480
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of Tampa.

812
00:55:11,198 --> 00:55:11,458
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

813
00:55:12,399 --> 00:55:12,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a burn.

814
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:13,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

815
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,142
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, I don't have any FUs this week.

816
00:55:20,004 --> 00:55:22,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess... Okay, I got one.

817
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:28,109
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to Burger King for coming out with the Deluxe Steakhouse Burger.

818
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:35,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I understand, as cool of an idea as it sounds like on paper, it really is not a very good burger.

819
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:36,674
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's got, what...

820
00:55:37,096 --> 00:55:39,138
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, steak, like onions.

821
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:44,463
[SPEAKER_11]: But where they go wrong with it is that it has mashed potatoes on the burger.

822
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:45,665
Ew.

823
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:47,486
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do that in elementary school.

824
00:55:47,506 --> 00:55:48,968
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds nasty.

825
00:55:49,508 --> 00:55:50,129
[SPEAKER_11]: I tried it.

826
00:55:50,249 --> 00:55:51,230
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't very good.

827
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,832
[SPEAKER_11]: But the Steakhouse Burger itself is good.

828
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:54,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Just don't go deluxe.

829
00:55:54,553 --> 00:55:56,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Or if you do, minus mashed potatoes.

830
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:59,018
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds more like a shepherd's pie burger.

831
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,124
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've got this beef in there, you

832
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:29,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty, by the way, is in chat and she's a BK expert of sorts.

833
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:30,585
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, I agree with that.

834
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:32,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I like the potatoes.

835
00:56:32,087 --> 00:56:33,590
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the meat that's fucking nasty.

836
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:36,935
[SPEAKER_11]: No, the meat's not bad.

837
00:56:37,335 --> 00:56:38,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Try McDonald's.

838
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:38,557
[SPEAKER_11]: That shit's horrible.

839
00:56:38,777 --> 00:56:40,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go again with Orange Lounge Foodio.

840
00:56:43,659 --> 00:56:47,520
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to my pancreas, again, for giving me problems the past few days.

841
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically the cysts that I believe burst on my pancreas.

842
00:56:51,001 --> 00:56:53,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Ew, I know, but think how it feels.

843
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:56,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a couple days ago, which caused me to have a lot of pain.

844
00:56:57,643 --> 00:56:58,724
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm still in pain today.

845
00:56:58,744 --> 00:57:00,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like there's a hole in my pancreas.

846
00:57:00,624 --> 00:57:01,144
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurts.

847
00:57:01,244 --> 00:57:01,665
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it.

848
00:57:02,325 --> 00:57:02,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um...

849
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,266
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to drama in general.

850
00:57:05,286 --> 00:57:07,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about any chat room drama that's going on or whatever.

851
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:11,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about drama in my personal life, because I had a lot of drama.

852
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I had epic drama yesterday.

853
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:18,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic, with a capital E-P-I-C, all caps, epic drama yesterday.

854
00:57:18,673 --> 00:57:19,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

855
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:23,656
[SPEAKER_04]: And by great, I mean shitty.

856
00:57:24,476 --> 00:57:24,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

857
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:27,998
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it, your FUs of the week.

858
00:57:28,439 --> 00:57:29,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

859
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:32,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we must.

860
00:57:35,181 --> 00:57:35,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

861
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:36,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

862
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:39,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Arby's bought out Wendy's for real?

863
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:39,882
[SPEAKER_00]: They did?

864
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:44,544
[SPEAKER_04]: How did Arby's buy... Here we go back to Orange Lounge Radio Foodio.

865
00:57:45,564 --> 00:57:47,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Arby's bought... Wouldn't it be the other way around?

866
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:48,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Wendy's was number three.

867
00:57:48,285 --> 00:57:49,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't Wendy's buy Arby's?

868
00:57:51,066 --> 00:57:52,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Arby's is nastified.

869
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:56,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Except their hash brown things are really good to dip in the cheese.

870
00:57:57,929 --> 00:57:58,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So guess what?

871
00:57:59,570 --> 00:57:59,790
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

872
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Home.

873
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're trying to buy Wendy's.

874
00:58:02,671 --> 00:58:02,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

875
00:58:03,908 --> 00:58:04,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, home.

876
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:04,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in it.

877
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:10,450
[SPEAKER_05]: The open beta is going to be in fall 2008.

878
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:14,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So the closed beta has been extended.

879
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:22,935
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Sony is going to be inviting more people to join, so maybe they'll actually update stuff in it like they said they were.

880
00:58:22,995 --> 00:58:27,557
[SPEAKER_11]: How about they invite everyone to join and just release it?

881
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:53,818
[SPEAKER_11]: because I think they're still hashing out stuff and according to some of the updates there haven't really been updates they've just been sort of sitting there going la la la this takes me back to what was it I want to say spring of 2006 when they're like yeah the Playstation 3 is coming out in the spring of 2006 oh wait no it's not it's coming out next year

882
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And hasn't home been delayed like four times now?

883
00:58:57,741 --> 00:58:57,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

884
00:58:58,041 --> 00:58:59,322
[SPEAKER_05]: And we haven't had the boomerang.

885
00:58:59,782 --> 00:59:03,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Home, Spore, Forever, Duke Nukem, Chinese Democracy.

886
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:03,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

887
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not like we have democracy here.

888
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:09,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

889
00:59:11,255 --> 00:59:14,116
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, Sony delays.

890
00:59:14,576 --> 00:59:17,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you unplugged me, bastard.

891
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:20,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, it just makes my monitor go slightly dimmer.

892
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:23,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Live radio.

893
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to get up for a minute, sorry.

894
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:31,343
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, one thing that's not been delayed is any sort of sequels to Guitar Hero.

895
00:59:31,563 --> 00:59:34,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's more rumors now coming out about Guitar Hero 4.

896
00:59:34,964 --> 00:59:43,672
[SPEAKER_11]: including that, yes, they're going to jump on the Rock Band bandwagon, adding vocals, drums, and regular download content to the next game.

897
00:59:46,154 --> 00:59:51,558
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the other things that they were saying that they want to add as well is local content from local bands.

898
00:59:52,339 --> 01:00:01,207
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I'm assuming when they're saying local, that means major city local and not like, I don't know, Hoboken, you know.

899
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:02,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

900
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:06,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether this will happen or not, I'm sure we'll find out at E3.

901
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:10,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it does, does anyone think this is sort of copying?

902
01:00:10,613 --> 01:00:13,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, do we even want to go there?

903
01:00:13,295 --> 01:00:14,675
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no other game has done this before.

904
01:00:15,656 --> 01:00:16,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good.

905
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:17,417
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be the first.

906
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:20,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

907
01:00:21,399 --> 01:00:24,481
[SPEAKER_04]: What can they do to differentiate themselves from Rock Band?

908
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:28,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know that people are going to say something.

909
01:00:31,605 --> 01:00:33,126
[SPEAKER_11]: They're... I don't know.

910
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,164
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to make their drums look different.

911
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:37,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

912
01:00:37,565 --> 01:00:38,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, though.

913
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:43,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing that is going to piss me the F off, is that the controllers will not be compatible again.

914
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:44,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm telling you what.

915
01:00:44,368 --> 01:00:48,490
[SPEAKER_04]: There is going to be hell to pay from the consumers, and one of these games is going to be out.

916
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:55,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, right now there's room for two, but one of these games will be shut out if they start making these controllers incompatible with each other.

917
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:56,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark my words.

918
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:57,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

919
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,815
[SPEAKER_11]: The controllers were incompatible because...

920
01:01:00,515 --> 01:01:04,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Microsoft says all the controllers have to work with all the games, basically.

921
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:08,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, guitar games have to work with all the guitar controllers, etc.

922
01:01:09,342 --> 01:01:12,685
[SPEAKER_11]: So you won't ever run into that issue with the Xbox 360.

923
01:01:12,805 --> 01:01:22,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Where you will run into this issue with is the Wii, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3 versions, where they just say, where Activision's like, well, you know what?

924
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:26,256
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just not going to license you to use these controllers, so fuck off.

925
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:27,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Buy ours.

926
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:28,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

927
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:29,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It just...

928
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:31,162
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of lame.

929
01:01:31,943 --> 01:01:43,958
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of lame, you know, but at the same, I guess, you know, you can't just have one fighting game, one music game, but these games are expensive, and my thing is, like, I think it's a little too late.

930
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:49,385
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to innovate or get out, and, you know, they originally were kind of trying to corner, like,

931
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:52,076
[SPEAKER_11]: The Hardcore Guitar Playing Thing.

932
01:01:52,296 --> 01:02:02,881
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like In A Groove in Dance Dance Revolution, whereas In A Groove was more technical, it was a lot harder, and they're going to do stuff like that, whereas Rock Band's more accessible.

933
01:02:02,941 --> 01:02:06,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, granted, it's really expensive to get into it, but it's more accessible, it's easier.

934
01:02:07,283 --> 01:02:14,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And one was a giant flop, although you have about 100 hardcore fans that will scream and bitch and try to tell you otherwise, but...

935
01:02:15,984 --> 01:02:19,526
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's my thing is now Harmonix is not developing the game.

936
01:02:19,886 --> 01:02:20,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it going to be any good?

937
01:02:21,106 --> 01:02:25,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because I don't know if Guitar Hero 3 was quite as good as Guitar Hero 2.

938
01:02:26,028 --> 01:02:28,249
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's people who go both ways.

939
01:02:28,329 --> 01:02:34,732
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, the fact that they're developing entirely new stuff for like, you know, some sort of singing thing and that kind of stuff.

940
01:02:35,472 --> 01:02:35,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

941
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:39,234
[SPEAKER_11]: And will Harmonix sue because, you know, they're kind of ripping them off.

942
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,361
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

943
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,611
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I market a music game to the US?

944
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:57,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

945
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:31,365
[SPEAKER_04]: The Triple Bonus Pack has the Memory Lamp, which will allow you to watch all the past event scenes again, which is good, because Lost Odyssey, you know, high-def cutscenes, awesomeness, good times.

946
01:03:32,186 --> 01:03:41,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Shattered Bond is a new antique that adds another one of the dream sequences in Lost Odyssey, which you really have to kind of experience a Lost Odyssey dream sequence.

947
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:44,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unlike anything we've seen in gaming for a little while since, like, Zork.

948
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:46,913
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's cool!

949
01:03:47,053 --> 01:03:48,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I can't explain it.

950
01:03:48,213 --> 01:03:48,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's...

951
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:51,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But the stories are really good.

952
01:03:52,735 --> 01:03:54,816
[SPEAKER_04]: They're really good.

953
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:55,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

954
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:56,056
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't play enough of it.

955
01:03:56,917 --> 01:04:00,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer Machine is a new ring also that comes out with the game.

956
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:02,540
[SPEAKER_04]: And rings are an essential part of the game.

957
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:03,560
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play the game, you know that.

958
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:05,281
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you have it.

959
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Download content for Lost Odyssey.

960
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Also some other download content.

961
01:04:08,643 --> 01:04:09,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, what was it?

962
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:09,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Army of Two.

963
01:04:09,863 --> 01:04:11,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some download content this week as well.

964
01:04:12,385 --> 01:04:15,746
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're into that game, there's some new download content you can check out there.

965
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:18,768
[SPEAKER_04]: 600 points for the SSC Challenge.

966
01:04:19,714 --> 01:04:20,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Army of your mom.

967
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:24,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Army of me and your mom would be too.

968
01:04:25,075 --> 01:04:25,576
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

969
01:04:27,676 --> 01:04:28,916
[SPEAKER_05]: The next story makes me sad.

970
01:04:29,177 --> 01:04:29,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

971
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:35,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it doesn't make me sad as far as their stance, but it makes me sad for the industry in general.

972
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:46,221
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a story run in the New York Times about Stern Pinball being the last pinball factory left in the world.

973
01:04:47,586 --> 01:04:57,554
[SPEAKER_05]: and the president of the company, Gary Stern, basically said that they're planning on sticking around and that they expect the industry to rebound in the next 10 years.

974
01:04:59,415 --> 01:05:02,918
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically become more of the enthusiast market these days.

975
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:09,042
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that when they're selling their machines, they're not going to arcades, they're going to people.

976
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:13,225
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to the people who really care about the product.

977
01:05:14,646 --> 01:05:15,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's sad.

978
01:05:16,227 --> 01:05:16,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn you, Williams.

979
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:21,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hope it doesn't go away forever.

980
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:21,630
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

981
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,852
[SPEAKER_04]: When you hear there's only one left, it's kind of sad.

982
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:25,712
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got the market.

983
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:27,053
[SPEAKER_04]: The end of an era.

984
01:05:27,393 --> 01:05:30,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what I was reading up on that I really want to go to this year?

985
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,075
[SPEAKER_05]: The table they did was good.

986
01:05:31,796 --> 01:05:32,656
[SPEAKER_04]: California Extreme.

987
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:33,837
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to make sure I go this year.

988
01:05:33,857 --> 01:05:34,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I love California Extreme.

989
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:35,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

990
01:05:35,418 --> 01:05:40,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinnagogo is... I won't be going to it this year because I'll have company.

991
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:40,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sad.

992
01:05:41,201 --> 01:05:43,142
[SPEAKER_05]: But Pinnagogo is Memorial Day weekend.

993
01:05:43,604 --> 01:05:44,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fun.

994
01:05:44,905 --> 01:05:47,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I actually have Memorial Day weekend free this year.

995
01:05:47,367 --> 01:05:50,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, because Faname isn't happening for us this year.

996
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:51,370
[SPEAKER_04]: We're sitting out this year.

997
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe I'll go to that instead.

998
01:05:54,072 --> 01:05:54,453
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

999
01:05:54,793 --> 01:05:55,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan will be going.

1000
01:05:55,653 --> 01:05:55,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1001
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:57,255
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1002
01:05:58,436 --> 01:06:03,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade Expo, by the way, as long as my medical issues pull through, I'm going.

1003
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:08,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means, you know, it is the last weekend in August.

1004
01:06:08,243 --> 01:06:08,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Seattle.

1005
01:06:08,844 --> 01:06:09,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go.

1006
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: and, by the way, going to be a huge conglomeration of all-games podcasters there.

1007
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:18,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, at least six different shows have representation, if not more.

1008
01:06:18,692 --> 01:06:19,592
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be pretty awesome.

1009
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:19,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good.

1010
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:20,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can go, Jamie.

1011
01:06:20,953 --> 01:06:23,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you can talk to wife into letting you go, Loki.

1012
01:06:23,594 --> 01:06:24,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we'll see.

1013
01:06:25,495 --> 01:06:35,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Loki, he's got our last story for tonight, and after that story is read, we're going to open up the Skype line, which is available at 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
01:06:36,837 --> 01:06:37,397
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1015
01:06:53,988 --> 01:07:07,461
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, tried to get Blizzard to allow him to create a movie for, in which Blizzard COO Paul Sams replied, we will not sell the movie rights, not to you, especially not to you.

1016
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Bravo!

1017
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:23,002
[SPEAKER_11]: They're worried that because it's such a success online that a bad movie would destroy that oncoming income, perhaps, or at least tarnish it.

1018
01:07:23,183 --> 01:07:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for Blizzard for realizing what epic mistake they would have made if they had let him direct this movie.

1019
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:31,847
[SPEAKER_04]: But are we sure this is actually true?

1020
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

1021
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:37,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Because part of me goes, this seems like a fanboy might have said this or something.

1022
01:07:37,089 --> 01:07:37,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1023
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1024
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:44,028
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, that's going to do it for tonight's stories until we get to last-minute stories, of which I'm sure Loki has a few of tonight.

1025
01:07:44,608 --> 01:07:46,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, we're going to open up the Skype line.

1026
01:07:46,249 --> 01:07:47,950
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1027
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1028
01:07:50,831 --> 01:07:52,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones and open them up.

1029
01:07:53,492 --> 01:07:54,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got a call.

1030
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:55,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, caller, are you there?

1031
01:07:56,174 --> 01:07:57,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's up, guys?

1032
01:07:57,394 --> 01:07:58,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, who is this?

1033
01:07:58,695 --> 01:08:01,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Toshin from All Games and every other chat room known to man.

1034
01:08:01,396 --> 01:08:02,377
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Toshin?

1035
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You listen to pretty much all the All Games shows, don't you?

1036
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,831
[SPEAKER_10]: I listen to a lot of them because I'm a bored person.

1037
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:09,252
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

1038
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:10,212
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's there.

1039
01:08:10,273 --> 01:08:14,275
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some people listen to regular radio, some people listen to all-games radio if they're cool.

1040
01:08:16,156 --> 01:08:19,357
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've been listening to all-games for ages, haven't you?

1041
01:08:19,397 --> 01:08:23,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you were with them back when they were, what was that other thing, Sudo or whatever they had?

1042
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:24,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

1043
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:25,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Way back there.

1044
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:31,223
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I actually skipped G4, but I was around back when Scott was on the East Coast and all that.

1045
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:34,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because you're in Canada, so you kind of had to skip out on G4, right?

1046
01:08:35,847 --> 01:08:38,409
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never seen anything related to G4 ever, which is probably safer.

1047
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:39,450
[SPEAKER_10]: You ain't missing much.

1048
01:08:40,571 --> 01:08:42,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, what's on your mind?

1049
01:08:44,194 --> 01:08:49,779
[SPEAKER_10]: I've come into a new console called Xbox 360 and I was wondering if you could recommend me some stuff.

1050
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:51,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360.

1051
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,541
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox 360 is awesome.

1052
01:08:53,561 --> 01:08:54,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you online with your Xbox 360?

1053
01:08:54,482 --> 01:08:56,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you checked out Xbox Live Arcade yet?

1054
01:08:57,063 --> 01:08:58,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually working on that as we speak.

1055
01:08:58,883 --> 01:09:07,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm on a temporary laptop because my other PC got fried over the week, so I haven't been online much, but that's a different story.

1056
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:11,888
[SPEAKER_10]: But as soon as I get it back, I'm going to definitely hit up Live, and I'm going to need some friends and all that kind of stuff.

1057
01:09:12,168 --> 01:09:12,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're invited.

1058
01:09:13,689 --> 01:09:14,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Good time.

1059
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:16,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's going to recommend the Orange Box for Portal.

1060
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:19,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say on Xbox Live Arcade, you definitely want to get some stuff.

1061
01:09:19,272 --> 01:09:21,233
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to get Geometry Wars.

1062
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:22,894
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to get... Symphony of the Night.

1063
01:09:22,954 --> 01:09:23,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Symphony of the Night.

1064
01:09:23,895 --> 01:09:25,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yeah.

1065
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,157
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a music game fan, right?

1066
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:28,818
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what brought you to OLR in the first place, right?

1067
01:09:29,338 --> 01:09:29,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1068
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to get Rez HD.

1069
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,861
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact... I have that for my Dreamcast too.

1070
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,082
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact...

1071
01:09:35,982 --> 01:09:39,283
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have a code for Rez HD that I never gave away.

1072
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:45,404
[SPEAKER_04]: And now if he just got an Xbox 360, he might be the one person who doesn't already have Rez.

1073
01:09:46,464 --> 01:09:47,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I don't.

1074
01:09:47,945 --> 01:09:51,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to give Toshin the code for Rez HD.

1075
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:55,066
[SPEAKER_04]: But will we have to make Toshin do something to earn it?

1076
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,267
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we make Toshin do to earn it?

1077
01:09:58,287 --> 01:09:59,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the hook, am I?

1078
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:00,788
[SPEAKER_09]: You what?

1079
01:10:00,808 --> 01:10:02,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the hook, am I?

1080
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:06,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, FootyMonster's complaining because he doesn't have Rez either.

1081
01:10:07,232 --> 01:10:07,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know.

1082
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:09,293
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure something out.

1083
01:10:09,653 --> 01:10:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Toshin, you and I will have a chat offline and maybe we can hook you up with Rez.

1084
01:10:13,414 --> 01:10:15,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll have to make you and FootyMonster fight for it.

1085
01:10:17,896 --> 01:10:21,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, maybe we'll make... He has his own podcast.

1086
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:21,817
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what we'll do?

1087
01:10:22,237 --> 01:10:26,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make Footy and Toshin play a game next week on the show.

1088
01:10:26,819 --> 01:10:28,419
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get some guests and we'll play match game.

1089
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:29,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be here next week?

1090
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:30,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Up here.

1091
01:10:31,089 --> 01:10:32,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to get Toshin.

1092
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:34,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make Footy come next week.

1093
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:36,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Footy and Toshin will play Epic Match Game.

1094
01:10:38,291 --> 01:10:39,912
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play Epic Match Game next week.

1095
01:10:39,972 --> 01:10:40,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it Epic?

1096
01:10:41,453 --> 01:10:42,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll find out.

1097
01:10:42,133 --> 01:10:44,714
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a new idea for Match Game to make it Epic.

1098
01:10:45,554 --> 01:10:47,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to play Epic Match Game next week.

1099
01:10:47,735 --> 01:10:47,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1100
01:10:49,055 --> 01:10:50,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyhow.

1101
01:10:52,276 --> 01:10:53,677
[SPEAKER_04]: What other types of games do you like, Toshin?

1102
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:56,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I like XBLA.

1103
01:10:57,938 --> 01:10:59,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I've played a couple of those games.

1104
01:11:00,921 --> 01:11:01,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I like anything.

1105
01:11:01,562 --> 01:11:02,764
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty neutral.

1106
01:11:02,784 --> 01:11:05,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I won't not down a game until I've tried it.

1107
01:11:05,347 --> 01:11:08,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pretty open to trying anything like RPGs.

1108
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:11,574
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like RPGs, you must, must, must get Lost Odyssey.

1109
01:11:12,175 --> 01:11:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

1110
01:11:13,576 --> 01:11:16,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not getting enough buzz out there.

1111
01:11:16,258 --> 01:11:16,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

1112
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:19,720
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for classic RPG fans.

1113
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,023
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like your old school RPGs from Super Nintendo and the Final Fantasies and stuff, you will love Lost Odyssey.

1114
01:11:26,143 --> 01:11:26,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1115
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:28,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Other types of games.

1116
01:11:28,665 --> 01:11:30,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, Portal if you're into shooters.

1117
01:11:30,146 --> 01:11:32,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Orange Box is just a great deal overall, frankly.

1118
01:11:32,867 --> 01:11:35,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what about a recommendation from you?

1119
01:11:35,309 --> 01:11:36,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Grand Theft Auto 4.

1120
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:38,350
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

1121
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:39,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I've never heard of the series.

1122
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:41,632
[SPEAKER_11]: I keep hearing stuff about it, though.

1123
01:11:41,953 --> 01:11:42,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Never heard of it.

1124
01:11:44,253 --> 01:11:44,533
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1125
01:11:44,753 --> 01:11:45,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to look into that one.

1126
01:11:45,993 --> 01:11:47,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you have some suggestions, Toshin.

1127
01:11:47,954 --> 01:11:49,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck to you, and congratulations on your purchase.

1128
01:11:50,814 --> 01:11:51,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll definitely check that out.

1129
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:52,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Any last thoughts for our listeners?

1130
01:11:55,815 --> 01:11:57,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Just enjoy the weather.

1131
01:11:57,956 --> 01:11:58,756
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting nice out.

1132
01:11:58,936 --> 01:11:59,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Turn down the garage.

1133
01:12:00,736 --> 01:12:02,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very, very hot out here right now.

1134
01:12:02,877 --> 01:12:06,057
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to enjoy it, but it's difficult when you're cooking alive out here.

1135
01:12:06,718 --> 01:12:08,238
[SPEAKER_04]: We're cooking Mama alive.

1136
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:08,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the big door.

1137
01:12:09,798 --> 01:12:10,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry.

1138
01:12:10,218 --> 01:12:10,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Mama will fix it.

1139
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:12,239
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

1140
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:13,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Not my mom.

1141
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Tosha, we gotta let you go.

1142
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:16,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1143
01:12:17,082 --> 01:12:17,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, see you later.

1144
01:12:17,802 --> 01:12:18,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye-bye.

1145
01:12:19,824 --> 01:12:21,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is Skype acting all janky tonight?

1146
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:23,787
[SPEAKER_04]: It's acting very slow.

1147
01:12:24,868 --> 01:12:25,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it.

1148
01:12:25,949 --> 01:12:27,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1149
01:12:27,029 --> 01:12:27,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1150
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:28,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Ranma.

1151
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:29,720
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, everyone?

1152
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:37,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much, although I've got to say Skylark is like, in chat room, Skylark is like jumping up and down screaming Eternal Sonata, which also was a really good game.

1153
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:45,851
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you like more action-oriented RPGs, like not of the Kingdom Hearts caliber necessarily, it's just a great story.

1154
01:12:45,952 --> 01:12:48,473
[SPEAKER_04]: If you like a good story, I do recommend Eternal Sonata.

1155
01:12:48,553 --> 01:12:49,294
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, what's up, Ranma?

1156
01:12:50,694 --> 01:12:52,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a couple of things before I begin.

1157
01:12:53,336 --> 01:13:00,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that you guys finally mentioned Video Power because every time you mention Starcade, I'm like, I've never seen this show.

1158
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:03,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I the only one that's ever seen Video Power?

1159
01:13:06,225 --> 01:13:09,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I have never seen Video Power, but apparently Jamie has.

1160
01:13:09,406 --> 01:13:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen Video Power.

1161
01:13:10,627 --> 01:13:10,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1162
01:13:11,427 --> 01:13:12,567
[SPEAKER_11]: How did I miss this show?

1163
01:13:12,607 --> 01:13:21,170
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one episode where the kid had to Velcro a Nintendo Entertainment System box to his head like he was running through a maze.

1164
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:23,331
[SPEAKER_11]: It was funny.

1165
01:13:25,131 --> 01:13:25,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1166
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you a contestant on Video Power or something?

1167
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:31,991
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but believe it or not, Video Power was actually two seasons.

1168
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:35,232
[SPEAKER_08]: The first season was with the kid that hosted as a game show.

1169
01:13:35,272 --> 01:13:42,915
[SPEAKER_08]: He would come in, show the Video Power cartoon, and at the end of the show, you put up either a review or a secret code, and that was it.

1170
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:46,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the second season was nothing but the game show aspect of it.

1171
01:13:50,417 --> 01:13:54,419
[SPEAKER_04]: So it started as a game advice show, and then it morphed into a game show?

1172
01:13:54,439 --> 01:13:54,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of weird.

1173
01:13:55,768 --> 01:14:05,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was sponsored by Acclaim because it was all about Narc, Quirk, Bigfoot, Arch Rivals, all that together as a superhero team.

1174
01:14:06,135 --> 01:14:07,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever happened to Acclaim?

1175
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:08,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they still around?

1176
01:14:09,037 --> 01:14:09,818
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they went under.

1177
01:14:09,838 --> 01:14:13,380
[SPEAKER_04]: But they came back doing MMOs now.

1178
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:14,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1179
01:14:16,127 --> 01:14:22,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, VidPowa, what other old school... Actually, we used to have a chatter named VidPowa, now that I think about it.

1180
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:25,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said it that way, because there was a chatter all the time that we had here.

1181
01:14:25,935 --> 01:14:27,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if they got his name from that.

1182
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:32,801
[SPEAKER_04]: What other types of old school video game-based TV shows do you remember?

1183
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:37,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually remember the Qbert cartoon and Donkey Kong.

1184
01:14:37,045 --> 01:14:37,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1185
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:41,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the Qbert cartoon, because it had the Valley Girl sort of character on there, too.

1186
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1187
01:14:45,786 --> 01:14:49,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a Pac-Man cartoon, but I don't remember Q-Bert.

1188
01:14:50,827 --> 01:14:56,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember one year, they had Pac-Man saving Santa Claus, and they played it at night, and I was so happy.

1189
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:06,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I always wanted to go on Nick Arcade, but I never did, because my parents didn't take me places where I could go on.

1190
01:15:06,613 --> 01:15:06,813
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1191
01:15:07,173 --> 01:15:08,993
[SPEAKER_05]: I did watch Captain N, and it pissed me off.

1192
01:15:09,414 --> 01:15:09,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

1193
01:15:10,514 --> 01:15:12,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I was like, dude, these characters aren't like that.

1194
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:13,515
[SPEAKER_05]: This sucks.

1195
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:15,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Super Mario Bros.

1196
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:16,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Show.

1197
01:15:17,131 --> 01:15:18,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked the Zelda episodes.

1198
01:15:18,592 --> 01:15:20,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Zelda Fridays were always awesome.

1199
01:15:21,092 --> 01:15:22,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all on DVD now.

1200
01:15:22,032 --> 01:15:24,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did like the Super Mario World one they did too.

1201
01:15:24,513 --> 01:15:25,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That one was pretty cool.

1202
01:15:26,713 --> 01:15:27,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

1203
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could always do the Mario at the end of the show.

1204
01:15:29,754 --> 01:15:30,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, enough reminiscing.

1205
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners, Ranma?

1206
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky, did you get Mario Kart Wii yet?

1207
01:15:35,135 --> 01:15:36,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you call me Scott?

1208
01:15:37,055 --> 01:15:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1209
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:37,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I said Sky.

1210
01:15:37,935 --> 01:15:38,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sky.

1211
01:15:39,095 --> 01:15:40,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wrong show.

1212
01:15:41,296 --> 01:15:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he's speaking New York.

1213
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:43,036
Sorry.

1214
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I get Mario Kart Wii yet?

1215
01:15:45,981 --> 01:15:46,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not.

1216
01:15:46,581 --> 01:15:46,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1217
01:15:46,941 --> 01:15:47,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't picked it up yet.

1218
01:15:47,641 --> 01:15:48,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1219
01:15:48,501 --> 01:15:50,622
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent the money on a new air conditioner for the garage today.

1220
01:15:51,182 --> 01:15:52,783
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll probably get it this week.

1221
01:15:53,843 --> 01:15:54,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great game.

1222
01:15:54,644 --> 01:15:55,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm loving it.

1223
01:15:55,424 --> 01:15:55,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1224
01:15:55,704 --> 01:15:58,365
[SPEAKER_04]: We played, you know, Loki had the advanced copy and we played it.

1225
01:15:58,445 --> 01:15:59,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I got my fill of it.

1226
01:15:59,745 --> 01:16:05,247
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will buy the game because I do want to play online with other people, even if Toadette's in the game and I can't stand her.

1227
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:07,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's also Baby Peach.

1228
01:16:07,668 --> 01:16:08,448
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not so bad.

1229
01:16:09,329 --> 01:16:09,729
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

1230
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:12,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I want your friend code.

1231
01:16:13,016 --> 01:16:14,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I owe you an ass beating in Mario Kart.

1232
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll think about it.

1233
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:19,685
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as I get online, I'm going to stop playing.

1234
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:20,646
[SPEAKER_11]: God, you're lazy.

1235
01:16:20,946 --> 01:16:24,270
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as he can tear himself away from Grand Theft Auto 4.

1236
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:26,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ranma, we've got to let you go to get more calls.

1237
01:16:26,493 --> 01:16:27,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1238
01:16:27,575 --> 01:16:28,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Later, guys.

1239
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:34,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck tearing Loki away from Grand Theft Auto 4 for a few days.

1240
01:16:34,858 --> 01:16:36,579
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is wrong with Skype today?

1241
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:38,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It's running horribly on my end.

1242
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,800
[SPEAKER_04]: At least the calls sound fine.

1243
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1244
01:16:41,101 --> 01:16:41,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1245
01:16:42,521 --> 01:16:43,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up, guys?

1246
01:16:43,062 --> 01:16:43,762
[SPEAKER_07]: This is FootyMonster.

1247
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:45,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello, FootyMonster.

1248
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:46,923
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you going to be here next week?

1249
01:16:48,024 --> 01:16:48,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.

1250
01:16:48,564 --> 01:16:50,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I want that free coffee for 60.

1251
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,385
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1252
01:16:51,665 --> 01:16:54,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be you and Toshin duking it out in Epic Match Game.

1253
01:16:55,127 --> 01:16:55,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Just you wait.

1254
01:16:56,792 --> 01:16:58,954
[SPEAKER_07]: The gloves are off, or whatever you want to call it.

1255
01:16:59,555 --> 01:17:00,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, it's going to be good times.

1256
01:17:01,236 --> 01:17:01,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's on your mind, Fuddy?

1257
01:17:03,098 --> 01:17:09,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, basically I wanted to share with you guys what I think personally is the best RPG I've played in a long time.

1258
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Persona 3?

1259
01:17:11,545 --> 01:17:11,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?

1260
01:17:12,186 --> 01:17:16,710
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's actually The World Ends With You for the DS that came out just last week.

1261
01:17:18,812 --> 01:17:21,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you, it's out there with console RPGs.

1262
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,570
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty fantastic.

1263
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:29,352
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I wasn't in such a PSP mood this week, I would have totally bought that game.

1264
01:17:29,432 --> 01:17:31,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the soundtrack's pretty hopping.

1265
01:17:31,892 --> 01:17:37,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Describe what this game's all about, because I've not seen much about it except for some of the artwork and the soundtrack.

1266
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:38,274
[SPEAKER_04]: How does this game work?

1267
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:41,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this game has different mechanics.

1268
01:17:41,675 --> 01:17:49,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me start by saying it's a game that can be as hardcore as you want it to be, but at the same time it can be as simple as you want it to be.

1269
01:17:49,554 --> 01:18:12,486
[SPEAKER_07]: which I think is very interesting because for portable people, especially RPG players on the go, maybe they don't want to delve too much into an RPG that's super complex, but yet this game allows you to make it either really complex, like for instance Shadow Slayer plays it in a really simple way, and I played it in a super complex way, in which I do much more stuff, yet we're both enjoying it just as much, which I thought was brilliant.

1270
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:13,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1271
01:18:14,913 --> 01:18:19,678
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, the game works on both screens at the same time, and you control two characters at the same time.

1272
01:18:20,059 --> 01:18:21,581
[SPEAKER_07]: One on the bottom screen, and one on the top screen.

1273
01:18:22,381 --> 01:18:29,910
[SPEAKER_07]: On the bottom screen, you control with your style to move and attack, and on the top screen, you move by your D-pad, or if you're right-handed or left-handed, with the face buttons.

1274
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:34,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you do, which sounds really convoluted, because you basically work...

1275
01:18:35,686 --> 01:18:37,067
[SPEAKER_07]: on both planes at the same time.

1276
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:45,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But the beauty is that you can actually set the other character to move automatically if you don't want to, or maybe automatically if you don't move it by every two seconds.

1277
01:18:45,752 --> 01:18:49,574
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way it gives you this freedom of like, okay, do I want to be really hardcore right now?

1278
01:18:50,155 --> 01:18:53,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do I just, I'm just playing for 30 minutes and I don't want to really buzz my head in with this.

1279
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought that was pretty impressive.

1280
01:18:56,419 --> 01:18:59,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with on the fly for different difficulty settings that you can change.

1281
01:19:00,796 --> 01:19:08,401
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go with easy, with super easy, normal, which is okay, except for the boss battle, hard, which is always hard, and ultimate, which is impossible, basically.

1282
01:19:31,816 --> 01:19:35,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, that's kind of the thing, only that you can't really let anyone else control it.

1283
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:43,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I was thinking when I was playing this game with Jack, we were thinking, dude, how awesome would it be if with Wi-Fi you could control top screen and I could control bottom screen or vice versa.

1284
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:44,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be so much fun.

1285
01:19:44,839 --> 01:19:52,981
[SPEAKER_07]: But this game really surprised me because I actually wrote in the audience forums a small, super tiny paragraph that basically describes how I feel about this game.

1286
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:59,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I tried to wrap it out in a way that I let people call in as well and not, you know,

1287
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:04,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you'll allow me, I'd like to read that.

1288
01:20:04,735 --> 01:20:05,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like five lines.

1289
01:20:05,996 --> 01:20:06,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, go for it.

1290
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:12,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, what I said is, it's bar none the best RPG I've played in a while, at least on portables.

1291
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:18,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect and Persona 3 take the cake on consoles, for sure, at least in what I've played lately, right?

1292
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:30,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I was totally hooked with the story and the impressive amount of plot twists that never cease to be interesting, which totally surprised me because I can't remember the last time a BS game or a PSP game engaged me in that way.

1293
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,424
[SPEAKER_07]: in that way that I go, okay, I can't really put this down.

1294
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:35,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Lost Odyssey could do with you.

1295
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:39,887
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of commitment, which blew my mind, really.

1296
01:20:40,987 --> 01:20:52,652
[SPEAKER_07]: The game definitely must be played by any DS owner just because it's really accessible as an RPG because you can tone everything down, play easy, automatic on your partner, and just never worry about anything by looking at the cool story.

1297
01:20:53,512 --> 01:20:57,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you can go all the way hardcore if you wanted to if you're a really avid RPG player.

1298
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:01,231
[SPEAKER_07]: and the music as we've heard on the break today is amazing.

1299
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you haven't checked it out, you need to check it out because it's fantastic.

1300
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:05,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out there with Persona 3.

1301
01:21:05,633 --> 01:21:07,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super modern, super upbeat.

1302
01:21:08,433 --> 01:21:18,317
[SPEAKER_07]: It has interesting beats that I really haven't heard in RPGs in a long time because, you know, RPGs today are elves and, you know, science fiction maybe and Final Fantasy and that's it.

1303
01:21:19,036 --> 01:21:21,359
[SPEAKER_07]: and this modern day setting is so refreshing.

1304
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:23,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you are in Shibuya.

1305
01:21:23,362 --> 01:21:23,662
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1306
01:21:23,802 --> 01:21:25,284
[SPEAKER_07]: No frills, no nothing.

1307
01:21:25,304 --> 01:21:26,606
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a very stylish Shibuya.

1308
01:21:26,686 --> 01:21:26,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1309
01:21:27,547 --> 01:21:28,449
[SPEAKER_07]: You're in Little Tokyo.

1310
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:33,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's one question I have about the game because I have to admit, one of the turn-offs for the game for me is that it's on the DS.

1311
01:21:34,316 --> 01:21:54,897
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't like I don't like seeing these type of like hardcore games on the DS because I don't know maybe I'm just old-fashioned but like the way I like to play my games is I like to have that big experience on the big television and really immerse myself with everything I feel like I can't be as immersed in the DS DS is more like a casual game system for me and I know I need to kind of get over it you know but

1312
01:21:56,172 --> 01:22:00,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think this game might have been better if it wasn't on the DS, if it was on an actual console?

1313
01:22:00,634 --> 01:22:01,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's a thing.

1314
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:07,476
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I'm so impressed by Square Enix here proving that they can do something that's not Dragon Quest and that it's not Final Fantasy.

1315
01:22:08,116 --> 01:22:09,537
[SPEAKER_07]: They made a game for the DS.

1316
01:22:10,937 --> 01:22:13,578
[SPEAKER_07]: It is meant to be played with the DS and you can't play it on another system.

1317
01:22:14,138 --> 01:22:14,719
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.

1318
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:16,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I thought was brilliant.

1319
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:20,081
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the dual screens are not used to showing a map.

1320
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:22,502
[SPEAKER_07]: There's action happening on both screens at the same time.

1321
01:22:22,922 --> 01:22:23,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically...

1322
01:22:24,298 --> 01:22:33,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to explain real quick, you're fighting enemies on the bottom screen, and the same enemies are cloned on the top screen, and it's kind of like fighting on a dual plane kind of battle.

1323
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:42,153
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you kill someone on the bottom screen, you die on the top screen as well, and they share the hit points from top to bottom, and you and your partner share the same hit points bar.

1324
01:22:42,173 --> 01:22:46,517
[SPEAKER_07]: So if your partner falls, it starts hitting out from your bottom screen life bar, basically.

1325
01:22:46,537 --> 01:22:47,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a vertical bar.

1326
01:22:47,898 --> 01:22:48,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1327
01:22:49,269 --> 01:22:51,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very interesting way that they've designed it.

1328
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:53,352
[SPEAKER_07]: They've said it in a way that blew my mind.

1329
01:22:53,372 --> 01:22:54,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't expect it.

1330
01:22:54,393 --> 01:22:58,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't expect it to blow my mind, not after what they've done lately, if you know what I mean.

1331
01:22:59,616 --> 01:23:05,020
[SPEAKER_07]: They haven't really been creative, and this is creative, which I thought was impressive.

1332
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:05,960
[SPEAKER_07]: The combat system is deep.

1333
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:09,443
[SPEAKER_07]: The art style, oh my god, that's great.

1334
01:23:09,523 --> 01:23:13,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, it's not 3D, but it's such a good 3D that doesn't make you miss 3D.

1335
01:23:14,526 --> 01:23:16,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Rave, Rave, Rave.

1336
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:18,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you're doing about this game, but that's great.

1337
01:23:18,612 --> 01:23:19,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1338
01:23:19,112 --> 01:23:21,736
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, really good.

1339
01:23:21,836 --> 01:23:26,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't go into the game because it looks like emo-ish, and it's not my style.

1340
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:27,623
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn it.

1341
01:23:27,643 --> 01:23:30,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I got into that game, and seriously, my life was over for a week and a half.

1342
01:23:30,887 --> 01:23:32,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I finished the game two days ago.

1343
01:23:32,899 --> 01:23:36,901
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's one of those games that I wish I hadn't played so I could play it again.

1344
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:40,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that good to me.

1345
01:23:40,322 --> 01:23:41,263
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how I rave about Persona 3?

1346
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:42,703
[SPEAKER_07]: I never actually finished Persona 3.

1347
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:43,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I got burnt out.

1348
01:23:43,984 --> 01:23:45,805
[SPEAKER_07]: This one, I'm not getting burnt out.

1349
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:49,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of stuff to do after the game is over which I think is really interesting as well.

1350
01:23:49,586 --> 01:23:51,087
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of stuff to do.

1351
01:23:51,367 --> 01:24:01,252
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting because with Grand Theft Auto 4 taking all the headlines this week, it's really interesting that a game like this might slip under the radar that people may miss out on.

1352
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:03,654
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1353
01:24:03,994 --> 01:24:13,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting GTA 4 myself, and I'm glad that I actually put the time since the game came out to play it before this came out because I probably would have lost it otherwise.

1354
01:24:13,559 --> 01:24:16,221
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why we dedicated last week's review to that game

1355
01:24:19,349 --> 01:24:20,399
[SPEAKER_07]: We did a totally enough review.

1356
01:24:20,942 --> 01:24:49,797
[SPEAKER_04]: and I can't recommend it enough that's why I wanted to come on your show guys because I know there's a lot of RPG listeners here and you as well I mean you guys play RPGs as well so I wanted you to guys you need to check this out before GTA comes in and steals your lives that's all I'm saying too late for Loki but there's still there's still hope for me and Jamie so you know if you're listening to this program Footy demands that you put down Grand Theft Auto and check out The World Ends With You if you own DS and I will I promise you I'll check it out soon good stuff alright Footy we gotta let you go take more calls but have a good one okay buddy

1357
01:24:50,723 --> 01:24:50,983
[SPEAKER_07]: No worries.

1358
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:51,363
[SPEAKER_07]: See you guys later.

1359
01:24:51,383 --> 01:24:52,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

1360
01:24:52,023 --> 01:24:53,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fearless webmaster has arrived.

1361
01:25:26,641 --> 01:25:35,289
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to decide what exactly I think of custom peripherals on the Wii.

1362
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:47,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I caught the latter half of Bobby's show and was listening, of course, to his complaints about the real power controls with the Mario Kart Wii wheel.

1363
01:25:48,247 --> 01:26:02,692
[SPEAKER_12]: and then Loki's earlier rant about the silly extensions for the baseball game that just puts the Wii out another foot so you can crack that priceless vase and kill your TV even quicker when you let go on accident and it flails away.

1364
01:26:04,312 --> 01:26:11,154
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a long, long, long ago wish list that I had and one of those was Fatal Frame moving to Nintendo.

1365
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:16,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I always, and I think I still do believe this, that the best...

1366
01:26:17,566 --> 01:26:18,906
[SPEAKER_12]: I need to take a step back, I'm failing.

1367
01:26:21,407 --> 01:26:29,629
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I've always wanted to do is have a camera to play Fatal Frame and have it translate to the character controls in-game.

1368
01:26:30,169 --> 01:26:40,992
[SPEAKER_12]: They never did that on the PS2 or Xbox, obviously, and apparently the fourth incarnation is coming to the Wii, when I'm not entirely sure, but I was reading that the other day.

1369
01:26:42,771 --> 01:26:55,658
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'm just trying to decide what worth a camera clamshell would be for the Wiimote or if it would be better as a dedicated controller or if the whole thing is just bupkits and you should use the normal controller anyways.

1370
01:26:55,758 --> 01:27:03,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my question is what having that extra clamshell and that extra stuff, what exactly does that bring to the experience?

1371
01:27:05,483 --> 01:27:11,946
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be the feeling, it would be the immersion, it would be the fact that you're not just pointing and changing channels on your TV.

1372
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:17,011
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's what the whole concept around this has been.

1373
01:27:17,071 --> 01:27:31,485
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been the attempt at immersion when the thing's impossible to do, or when there may be situations that prevent you from doing it, i.e., you don't golf in the rain, in the lightning storm, in the snow, you don't drive off-road at 100 miles an hour.

1374
01:27:31,505 --> 01:27:33,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe some people do, but they're just nuts.

1375
01:27:33,907 --> 01:27:38,051
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can't go around taking pictures of maniacal spirits that want to kill you.

1376
01:27:39,486 --> 01:27:46,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta ask Loki what you think about that, because you're a big anti-Wii peripheral person.

1377
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:54,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that there are some games that might justify these different peripherals, besides maybe just Wii Fit, where that kind of is the game?

1378
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:59,458
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, Jason's example is Fatal Frame with an actual clamshell camera.

1379
01:27:59,898 --> 01:28:03,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that there's other types of games that maybe can justify the...

1380
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:05,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Silly Controllers

1381
01:28:30,026 --> 01:28:30,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1382
01:28:51,846 --> 01:28:53,327
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, without having that on there.

1383
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:57,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, people say, oh, yeah, well, you can weight it and stuff, so it feels more natural.

1384
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:59,191
[SPEAKER_11]: But, yeah, then you can hit stuff and break it.

1385
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:07,216
[SPEAKER_11]: But as far as, like, if they came out with something that... It would be hard for them to do it, I guess, because of the infrared and stuff.

1386
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:10,918
[SPEAKER_11]: However you would do that, it would be really weird.

1387
01:29:10,938 --> 01:29:15,561
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they could pull it off in a way that was interesting, then maybe, yeah, that would be worth it.

1388
01:29:15,621 --> 01:29:17,563
[SPEAKER_11]: But a lot of these things are just, like...

1389
01:29:19,423 --> 01:29:24,247
[SPEAKER_11]: It's basically aimed at the people that will only buy the Wii for Wii Sports.

1390
01:29:24,828 --> 01:29:29,692
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're like, oh hey, now I can add this tennis racket thing and it looks like I'm really playing tennis.

1391
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:33,655
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just for the simple-minded, I guess.

1392
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:34,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1393
01:29:36,898 --> 01:29:37,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Simple-minded.

1394
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:38,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Very nice.

1395
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,204
[SPEAKER_12]: The abridged version of what I was going to say is that on the one hand, I love the Super Scope 6.

1396
01:29:43,384 --> 01:29:43,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

1397
01:29:44,025 --> 01:29:45,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Games were fantastic.

1398
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:49,142
[SPEAKER_12]: but it was so short-lived and you can't really reuse it.

1399
01:29:49,704 --> 01:29:52,134
[SPEAKER_12]: But on the flip side, I just want to play Fatal Frame with the camera.

1400
01:29:52,791 --> 01:29:58,515
[SPEAKER_12]: and thinking about that, I just had what probably amounts to one of the better ideas that cost way too damn much.

1401
01:29:58,735 --> 01:30:04,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I have to interrupt and go back to the camera because the chat room is so winter.

1402
01:30:04,419 --> 01:30:16,626
[SPEAKER_04]: They said not only could that camera be used for Fatal Frame, but the clamshell camera could also be used to play the OLR Dream Game WhatTheyPlay.com Snap from last week's show.

1403
01:30:17,687 --> 01:30:21,930
[SPEAKER_12]: The other inspiration was Pokemon Snap 2, so believe me, I completely understand that.

1404
01:30:23,416 --> 01:30:23,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Winner.

1405
01:30:23,816 --> 01:30:24,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Jason.

1406
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:28,380
[SPEAKER_12]: All three games we found a use for the camera.

1407
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:33,645
[SPEAKER_12]: This is probably the most infeasible thing to do for cost, but this would be freaking awesome.

1408
01:30:33,985 --> 01:30:37,128
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why I would want a camera is I would want an external screen.

1409
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:41,132
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, cameras have viewfinders, they have the LCD screen and all that kind of stuff on it.

1410
01:30:42,293 --> 01:30:44,575
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be interesting to have a rigging.

1411
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:50,019
[SPEAKER_12]: where the Wiimote plugs into the Nintendo DS and the DS becomes your viewfinder.

1412
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:57,752
[SPEAKER_12]: That way you have Fatal Frame on screen, but since you cannot, at least they had no better way to represent this in the PS2 version,

1413
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:01,102
[SPEAKER_12]: You cannot see the ghost's blind eye, naked eye.

1414
01:31:01,382 --> 01:31:02,783
[SPEAKER_12]: You can through the viewfinder.

1415
01:31:03,263 --> 01:31:04,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Lift up your DS.

1416
01:31:04,684 --> 01:31:15,732
[SPEAKER_12]: It shows you the same thing your character would be seeing in the environment based off where you're pointed on on the TV, but you will only be able to see the ghost and battle it through the DS screen, at least accurately, anyways.

1417
01:31:16,873 --> 01:31:21,936
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be the funnest game I have ever played, swear to God.

1418
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:26,499
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's probably not going to happen because that's... I was going to say, sadly, too damn intricate.

1419
01:31:26,519 --> 01:31:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: ...crazy and...

1420
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:29,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Two damn interkits, sadly.

1421
01:31:31,101 --> 01:31:34,703
[SPEAKER_12]: A kid can dream, but oh man.

1422
01:31:35,564 --> 01:31:42,247
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess the end result of all this is that one-off and small-use peripherals will continue to come around.

1423
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:44,988
[SPEAKER_12]: They will attempt to find reuse in which they will fail.

1424
01:31:45,008 --> 01:31:49,050
[SPEAKER_12]: They will fade into obscurity and people will reminisce like we do the Super Scope.

1425
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:52,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Virtual Boy.

1426
01:31:53,372 --> 01:31:56,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason, we've got to let you go because we're going to wrap up the show, but thanks so much as always for the call.

1427
01:31:58,424 --> 01:31:58,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

1428
01:31:59,505 --> 01:32:00,585
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you get your dream game.

1429
01:32:22,633 --> 01:32:23,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, I have a few, I guess.

1430
01:32:25,754 --> 01:32:30,035
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a game coming out that's got a great name, so I think it's worth checking it out.

1431
01:32:31,135 --> 01:32:35,717
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a RTS game called Stalin vs. the Martians.

1432
01:32:37,897 --> 01:32:43,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, you play Joseph Stalin, and you have to save Russia from Martians.

1433
01:32:45,015 --> 01:32:47,760
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of like a real-time strategy game.

1434
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:52,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks similar to maybe Civilization or something like that.

1435
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting name, though.

1436
01:32:56,816 --> 01:32:57,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see here.

1437
01:32:58,911 --> 01:33:08,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently our friend Lord Voldemort is on a road trip now to remove Grand Theft Auto 4 ads from U.S.

1438
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:09,957
[SPEAKER_11]: transit lines.

1439
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:27,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently he has sent emails to Miami Mayor Carlos Alvarez saying Grand Theft Auto games have been obsessively played by a number of teens who have then copycatted the outrageous sociopathic violence in the games and killed innocent people.

1440
01:33:28,567 --> 01:33:34,351
[SPEAKER_11]: and so he is being himself, I guess.

1441
01:33:35,411 --> 01:33:36,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this is actually pretty cool.

1442
01:33:36,892 --> 01:33:46,598
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how they're doing Street Fighter 2 HD, which is basically an HD remix of Street Fighter, all the stuff redrawn and stuff like that?

1443
01:33:46,878 --> 01:33:52,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there is a homebrew project being done to do something very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

1444
01:33:52,702 --> 01:33:53,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

1445
01:33:53,943 --> 01:33:54,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

1446
01:33:54,443 --> 01:33:59,868
[SPEAKER_11]: They're redrawing all the characters and it looks pretty good so far with new sprites.

1447
01:33:59,908 --> 01:34:09,777
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to add MP3 music to it, true 3D special stages, and then I guess a bunch more stuff.

1448
01:34:10,157 --> 01:34:12,900
[SPEAKER_11]: 256 colors with one alpha channel and all sorts of fun.

1449
01:34:13,140 --> 01:34:13,700
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd buy that.

1450
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:15,061
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds awesome.

1451
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:18,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the Sonic 2 on Xbox Live should have been in the first place.

1452
01:34:18,645 --> 01:34:18,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1453
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:30,458
[SPEAKER_11]: And then apparently, you remember Ben Heck, his PlayStation 3 laptop that he made went up on auction and actually ended up selling for $9,000.

1454
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:33,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeeez

1455
01:35:00,669 --> 01:35:03,292
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is it.

1456
01:35:04,593 --> 01:35:07,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

1457
01:35:08,378 --> 01:35:10,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1458
01:35:11,282 --> 01:35:13,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll start tonight.

1459
01:35:13,304 --> 01:35:14,926
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, ow, chest pain.

1460
01:35:15,707 --> 01:35:16,728
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1461
01:35:17,029 --> 01:35:18,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Tired, hot, headache.

1462
01:35:19,147 --> 01:35:20,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

1463
01:35:20,127 --> 01:35:21,328
[SPEAKER_04]: More Grand Theft Auto 4!

1464
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:23,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to Vegas this week.

1465
01:35:23,589 --> 01:35:24,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, lucky you.

1466
01:35:25,009 --> 01:35:25,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucky, lucky you.

1467
01:35:25,549 --> 01:35:26,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go train people.

1468
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:29,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everybody for downloading and tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

1469
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:31,151
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate your support.

1470
01:35:31,231 --> 01:35:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, it's because of you guys that independent podcasting works.

1471
01:35:35,353 --> 01:35:38,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So please, if you enjoy our show, tell a friend or two about Orange Lounge Radio.

1472
01:35:38,534 --> 01:35:42,135
[SPEAKER_04]: If you tell two friends about our show, then slowly but surely we can take over the world.

1473
01:35:42,175 --> 01:35:47,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, leave us some nice words on podcast review sites too, such as iTunes.

1474
01:35:47,777 --> 01:35:53,682
[SPEAKER_04]: We could use some more five-star reviews there or Podcast Alley, any of those places, dig.com, any place that lists podcasts.

1475
01:35:53,702 --> 01:35:55,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Say something nice about Orange Launch Radio.

1476
01:35:55,204 --> 01:35:56,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It really helps to spread the word.

1477
01:35:56,465 --> 01:35:58,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it really does work, believe it or not.

1478
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:00,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to do it for tonight.

1479
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:01,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, guys.

1480
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:05,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Until then, next week on the program, epic match game.

1481
01:36:06,334 --> 01:36:07,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise it'll be good.

1482
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:08,495

1484
01:36:11,878 --> 01:36:12,499
