Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Loco King

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight April 27th, 2008, the old classic game Splatterhouse is set to return

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Burnout Paradise is getting patched for motorcycle riding

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And are arcade ticket redemption machines a form of illegal gambling?

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
And welcome to another week of the program that Bobby Blackwolf had to censor three times tonight

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
Orange Lounge Radio, live at www.allgames.com

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always to talk about video games

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Video gaming, gaming culture, and gamer lifestyle

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
My BFF in the world, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Hi

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
How are you?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
I'm tired

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Tired?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Because of the sun

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Tired cat is very tired?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Sleepy Jamie is sleepy

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I know, it's very, we have heat issues here

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Because obviously, you know, our show is based in Sacramento, California

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
And we're just starting to get into summer

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I think it's only like 90 degrees out

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And yes, even though it's late April, it's starting to get into summer

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
It's what, 90 degrees out?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
And yeah, it's getting very hot here in the studio

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
And we're trying to buy more fans to help with the problem

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
83

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
It's only 83 outside

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Hence me saying not even

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Lord

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
No, it's 90

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Oh, okay

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
It was 83 last time I checked

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Because I was going to say, when we get into June and July

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
We're going to have 105

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
However

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
And I'm going to cry

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
However, the forecast says that it's going to be 83 on Monday

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
And then in the 70s, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Huh

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
Well, thank you for the weather update

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
You know, people talk about the weather when there's nothing better to talk about

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
But we have video games and other things to talk about

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Right, Tech Master Loki, my other BFF

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Uh, yeah, how are you doing?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I'm doing fine

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Good

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I got a large soda today because

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
You knew it was going to be damn hot

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
It's hot

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
It is very hot

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
And I'm mad as all hell because I bought a box fan from Target

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
A 20-inch box fan and it's broken

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
And it was cracked inside the box

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Like somebody else returned it

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Box fans aren't very, uh, complex

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You know, just switch on, go

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Ugh, makes me mad

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
At least we have the nice oscillating fan that is doing a decent job

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
I think Jamie benefits more than the rest of us for that one

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yes, I do

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
You know what, it's not oscillating anymore

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
It's pointed on the back of my neck

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
God damn it, did that thing break too?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
No, I think when I tried to turn the ionizer off

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
I think I stopped the oscillator too, so

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
It's going to keep blowing on the back of my neck

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
I'll fix that

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
I was going to go back and fix that while DarkSakura talks about her gaming week

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
My gaming week

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
And just in time with the theme music

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
That's what I get when I don't hit the stop button

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Happens a lot here on this show

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
I've had a very, very, very, very busy

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Lots of stuff going on week

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
So I haven't gotten to play much other than Ragnarok

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
But I'm still trying to get a ZSNES to download

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
So that I can play, um, uh

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Seiken Densetsu 3

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And Dan was supposed to bring me back Mario Kart tonight

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
But I'm sort of like meh about it

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Because we've already had access to the game for like a week

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
So I'm kinda meh

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Although lately, like, I really, really want to play Street Fighter Alpha 2

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
You just, you're going in and digging in the old classics

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
Are you trying to find some new classic games of the week for the future?

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, I've actually been sort of wanting us to do our thing

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Right, our thing

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
So I've been thinking, because we're actually going to be cleaning out the vault

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Because we're getting a roommate

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
But I was thinking, um, once all that's set up

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
I wanted to bust out the Dreamcast and get on some Street Fighter 3 too

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
You know, as well

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Good times

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
And, uh, third impact on Dreamcast

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
Well, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of classic gaming in your future

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Let's move, I know, exciting stuff

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Let's move over to Loki and see if there's been a lot of classic gaming in his week

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes, I played a classic game called Saints Row

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Uh, I don't know, it's not really that classic anymore

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Um, it's fun

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
You know, we're still, actually we downloaded a new map this week

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Because we're bored with the three that they have

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
So we wanted the fourth one, the fourth one's okay

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
It's been out for, what, years now

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
But, you know, with the internet being blocked at our work

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
I had to kind of jerry-rig something in order to get to work

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
But, uh, that was all to just kill time until Grand Theft Auto IV

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Which I, uh, sneaked an early copy of

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
And, um, what more do I need to see?

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I've been looking for this game for, what, years now?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Since Grand Theft Auto III?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, probably since, like, you know, last Grand Theft Auto

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
San Andreas, yeah

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Okay

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
It's fucking awesome, I mean

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
It's, um, there, okay, let me just

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Since the game is, you know, pretty awesome

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
I'll just, you know, mention my gripes of the game

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I don't like the soundtrack, I think it's lame

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Um, I guess I've been spoiled with, like, Vice City and Grand Theft Auto III

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
But I hate the radio stations in, uh, IV

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I think they're crap

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Um, let's see, I don't like, um

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
I don't know, that might be just it

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Um, oh, I don't like how you can't skip the intro in the beginning of the game

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
Because you have to, it has to kind of boot up, I guess, a little bit

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Um, before it gets into loading and stuff

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
You just can't bypass all that little cutscene stuff

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
Um, uh, oh, and I don't like the fact that I don't know any cheat codes yet

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Because half the fun of Grand Theft Auto was when you didn't want to actually play through the story

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
As you're cheating like crazy and just getting rocket launchers and blowing everything up

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
I kind of miss that, but I'm sure that'll come out eventually once the game gets released

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
A couple questions, is the game worthy of the perfect 10 reviews it's receiving left and right?

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Probably, I mean, I don't, it's not perfect

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
But, I mean, it's damn good, I'd say give it a 9-8 or 9-9

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
But nothing's perfect

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Um, what is the most obscene thing you've done in the game so far?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
The most obscene thing?

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
Like, thing that is going to shock people like Hot Coffee

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Thing that is going to make Lord Voldemort

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
And if you haven't been listening to our show for a while

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Lord Voldemort is our nickname for somebody else

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
A very infamous lawyer in the gaming community

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
What is, like, the thing you've done that would piss Lord Voldemort off more than anything?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
I haven't really done that much in the game

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
I mean, there really hasn't been anything too controversial, I killed a guy

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And we dumped his body in a river, but

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I mean, well, other than the countless people that have been running over my car

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
Um, I would say it's a lot more realistic

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
So, like, you can shoot someone in the leg and they start hobbling away and stuff

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
Um, and also, um

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Oh, I went to the strip club in there

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
And they have, like, you know, pretty explicit lap dances

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Of course, no one's actually naked in there, but, you know, pasties or whatever

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
That's pretty explicit, I mean

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
They have, like, you can do three different lap dances

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
As it goes on there

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
And one of them has, like, two girls, like, making out on top of you

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
So I guess that's pretty explicit

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
And there's a girlfriend you get in the game in the very beginning there

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And you can go in for hot coffee, I guess

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
But it doesn't show anything

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And she actually screams, like, the weirdest things

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Wait, do they actually call it hot coffee?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Yeah

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
And the achievement, you get the achievement for that

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
For warm coffee, which is funny

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Um, I did see, um, in the video review from IGN

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
There was a scene, I'm assuming from, um

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
A hooker you can pick up, but it showed, like, a hooker, like, in your lap

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Bouncing up and down on you in a car

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
So that's pretty explicit, I guess

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
But nothing super over the top yet

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Um

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Apparently, I did get four stars one time

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
For riding a motorcycle onto the tarmac for the airport

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Apparently the police frown upon that kind of behavior

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I'm like, oh crap, four stars

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
So, that wasn't good

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Um

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
But overall, it's a good game

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Very, um

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Sometimes it can get annoying because the characters

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
There's a lot that uses that cell phone in the game

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And a lot of characters will call you to do different missions and stuff

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And if you don't answer the phone or if you don't do their mission

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
They, like, you have, like, a percentage of how much they like you

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And that'll go down if, um, you don't do their mission

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So the game doesn't let you just do the open sandbox thing?

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Because one thing I loved about Grand Theft Auto was just, like, you know

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I didn't even have to pay attention to the story

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Not necessarily

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
You can do the open sandbox thing

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
There's actually a mode on the phone that turned it into sleep mode

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
And that'll turn all the, um, in-game, like, story stuff off

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
And then you just go and do whatever

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So that's kinda cool

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
Um, but yeah, so, pretty much, just the radio

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
The stations are kinda retarded on there

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
You can watch TV, which is kinda funny

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
You have, like, fake TV shows on there

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Nice

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Um, and

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
I don't know, that's pretty much it for right now

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Let's go to the chat room

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
chat.orangelaungeradio.com

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
We always invite our listeners to come join us live and participate in our program

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
We read chat comments, take emails, and phone calls later on in the show

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
First comment tonight from Sephiroth1215

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
After reading the soundtrack on wiki, the Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack does look like it sucks

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Too bad, cause I love the San Andreas one

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
But, hey, I guess, you know, the best thing about it is

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
Since it is on the Playstation 3 and 360 custom soundtracks, so

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Uh, earlier Loki said there's no such thing as a perfect game

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
J-Rod says Silent Hill 1 is perfect, to me anyway

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
No, it's not

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Well, yeah, maybe to one person

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
And, you know, be honest, this is, it's the perfect Grand Theft Auto, I think, for me

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And I haven't even delved into, like, a lot of the online stuff yet

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Because, you know

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
You can do custom soundtracks

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
You can do custom soundtracks

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
So you can fix your major gripe right there

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, exactly, I just didn't like, cause I mean

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
In 3 even, it had, like, some pretty cool stuff

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Like, they had a station that was all electro music and that kind of thing

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
And that was really cool

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
And, like, in Vice City, man, all the stations were awesome there

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
It's just, there's a lot of music that I've never heard of in there

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And I guess it's kind of cool that it's new and exclusive to the game

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
But at the same time, I haven't heard of it and I don't really care for it

10:10.000 --> 10:14.000
Tigerclaw wants to know if you've explored the comedy club area of the game

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
I haven't gotten to a comedy club

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
The only thing I've gotten to right now is, like, a cabaret club

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
And that sucks

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Cabarets shit

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Do they have a burlesque show? That would be pretty awesome

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Um, I don't know if they have a burlesque show

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
The one time I went in there, they had this really crappy magician

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
The second time I went in there, they had some guy rolling around on the stage

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
With doing some sort of western thing

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Western monologue

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And then, you can, um

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
One of the first dates you go on is bowling

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So you can go bowl, which is kind of cool

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
They have darts, you can do billiards

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
They've got, um

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Dance Dance Revolution

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
They have a game that's like, I think it's supposed to be like Qbert in there

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
I don't know

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
I gotta go for another viewpoint

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Dark Sakura, any interest in Grand Theft Auto 4 at all?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
No

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
Why not?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I just don't like those games

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
They're not fun to me

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Is it not fun because there's no point?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
They're kind of boring

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Yeah?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Senseless violence not your thing?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I like senseless violence, I just think they're boring

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
I see

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
I see, I like, I agree with Loki

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
You gotta open up the cheat codes

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Because the best part of Grand Theft Auto, at least the last one

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Or I think it was Vice City I was playing that had this

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
There was the code that would just make the cars appear from the heavens

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
And you could just make like 80 cars pile up

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
And then fire a rocket at them and just make the biggest explosions in the world

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
That was my favorite part, because fire is awesome

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
My gaming week

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
You know, I kind of went and decided to go back to PSP gaming

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
Like, you know, I haven't been showing the PSP a lot of love here on the show with games

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
And after my trip recently where I was playing Final Fantasy 1

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I said, I'm gonna go get Final Fantasy 2 on the PSP

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
So I did that, I went and got Final Fantasy 2

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Which, you know, very similar to the remake of 1

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
It's high def, you know, pretty graphics

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Fun to play

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Loading times surprised me a little bit

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I don't know if it's just because my PSP is old and maybe I need to get a mini

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
But the loading times kind of surprised me how slow they are in some points

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
But it didn't really detract from the experience

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
It's just that I noticed it, which, you know, says something there

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
But the other game I've actually been playing a lot more of is Patapon

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
I bought that game

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
And it really was not what I thought it was going to be

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I expected it to be like a straight up music game

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
And certainly music is one element of it

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
But it was more of like a strategy type of game

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
I don't know how to say it

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
It's like a, you know, basically here's the gist of the game

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
For those who haven't played it is that, you know, the screen flashes in rhythm

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Like you'll hear a drum beat that goes

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Do, do, do

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
And then you hit the drums, which are the buttons on the PSP

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
You only get two drums to start, but you get more later on

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
You can, you know, hit the drums to issue commands to your little army

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
So you might go

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Pata, pata, pata, pon

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
And that makes them move forward

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Or you might go

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
Pon, pon, pata, pon

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
And that makes them attack the enemy

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
So not only are you having to think about the music

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
But you're having to think about, okay, what do I want to have them do next

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Do I want to have them march forward

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Do I want to have them attack

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Do I want to have them retreat

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Do I want to have them defend

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
You know, what do I want to have them do

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So, that was kind of interesting

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
But, I'll tell you what

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
The tutorial in the game, not so great

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Because it took me forever to figure out what was going on

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I was like, why isn't my freaking army listening to me

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And it took me like a minute to get the hang of the game

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Like, I think I needed it to kind of show me a little more

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Maybe I'm just stupid or old or something

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
But it took me a little bit to get the hang of

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
But then once I got in it, okay

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
And it's kind of cool that you can slowly build your army up

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
And there's that whole strategy of making the new characters

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
And what you want to equip them with

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Or if you're feeling lazy, you just have the game auto-equip them for you

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I think it's a pretty decent price for 20 bucks

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
It's a decent buy, so definitely check it out

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
It's a good price

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
The other game I've been playing this week is on Xbox Live Arcade

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
I actually bought the full version of Lost Cities

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
Which is the new card game

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
And I kind of went into it with very low expectations

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Because I was thinking it was going to be another one of those games

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
That was just very complicated

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Like, Catan

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Although Catan's a great game

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I just never got the hang of it

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
And it's just too much for me

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Because I don't play a lot of those types of board games

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
And I don't have a lot of

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I think the easiest way to learn those types of games

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Is to have friends that play them

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Because I think friends teaching you how to play those games

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Is much easier than the Xbox trying to teach you

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
And so I had the hardest time trying to learn Catan

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Because I didn't really play with anyone else that knew it

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And so I was thinking a lot of Lost Cities, I'm probably not going to get it

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
But the card game is actually pretty simplistic

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Yet, you know, one of those games that has a lot of depth to it

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
So I was kind of surprised

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
The only thing is, I'm not sure

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
You know, when all's said and done

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
There's not a lot of difference between Lost Cities and Uno

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
They're both card games

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
They're both, you know, they have the camera support

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
They both are pretty quick to play

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Granted, Lost Cities has a little more of strategy

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
But what is it? It's a virtual deck of cards, right?

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
So I'm not sure why Sierra justifies the extra $5

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
And charges $10 for Lost Cities

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Because there's nothing else there

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Like, you know what, unlockable art, woohoo

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
You know, there's not a lot to really justify that extra price

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
So like if I was a brand new Xbox owner

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And I wanted a card game, I'd go for Uno first

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
But Lost Cities isn't bad

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
It's just, you know, maybe a little bit overpriced

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
I imagine it's one of those games that's going to go on sale in six months

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
So we'll see what happens

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But I did have fun with it

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And I'm going to try to play some online matches

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Although I'm sure I'll get my ass handed to me

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
Because I guess there is more strategy in Lost Cities

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Unlike Uno

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
How can I describe Lost Cities real quick?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
Basically, you're trying to make numerical sequences from 2 to 10

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
On five different colors which represent cities

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
And you get, if you are going to start building on a color

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
You have to make a 20 point investment

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And you have to hope that you play enough cards

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
That will add up to 20 or over by the time the deck is out

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Well, in addition to those, there are these multiplier cards

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
That you can play first

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
They're called investment cards

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
And you can double, triple, or quadruple the amount of points that you'll earn

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
But you're also quadrupling the amount of points that you sacrifice to open up the city

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So it's kind of interesting

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Katamari's Forever says in chat

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Except Uno is appealing to housewives and school children

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And Lost Cities is for the Uber hardcore

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
That may be true, but it still doesn't justify the extra price to me

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
You know what I mean?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It doesn't seem like there's

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Essentially, they're both decks of cards as games

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
It's just one has a slightly more complicated rule set

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
That appeals to a more hardcore audience, I don't know

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Act Def says Strip Uno on Xbox Live with a cam

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Well, you could play Strip Lost Cities too, I guess

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
I'm not sure exactly what the rules for that would be

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
You don't need a webcam and an Xbox to play Strip Uno

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That's true

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
You could just have a bunch of people in the house and booze and then be naked

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
That's probably better anyways

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Real in-person naked is better

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Then you can see HooHoos and HaHa's IRL

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
But there's some people in this world who shouldn't be naked

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
And those are the people playing Strip Uno on Xbox Live, probably

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Yeah, but they probably don't have pictures of themselves

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
They're probably hired like a model

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Boobies

17:14.000 --> 17:20.000
I've got to wonder if like on XTube or Pornotube or any of those sites

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
If there is like a taped Strip Uno game or something that's on those sites

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
I don't know why I have that curious thought

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
But you know how I'm thinking of people using their webcams

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Like on Yahoo Webcam or whatever to do nasty things

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, why not take it one step further and upload it on the internet

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
For other fellow perverts to enjoy it

17:40.000 --> 17:47.000
I'm just wondering how Strip Uno would work since it takes so long to do one game

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
Maybe it's like if you do a draw four then you have to remove four articles of clothing or something

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
That might work

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Or you know, a draw two you remove two things

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
That could be the thing is that if you get a draw four and play it on you

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
Then either you draw four cards or you gotta take something off

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Like it could be a choice thing

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
That might be interesting

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
That would be interesting

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Not that we're encouraging people out of play

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
No, I don't think it should be a choice thing

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
I think you should just have to

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Alright, anyhow, we better

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Gerardo Mo's laughing my ass off

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
He says, Gerardo Mo says, I love Jamie's take on this

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
She always is here to give us a refreshing perspective from a female point of view

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Boobs are great

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Anyhow, that's our gaming week

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Let's get into housekeeping tonight

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
Hey, we got the Grand Theft Auto for Xbox 360 Elite Contest still going on

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
And you procrastinators, contest entries are due next week

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
And I'm going to tell you what, we have not gotten a lot of entries

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
I don't know if people are just taking their time because they want to make

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You know, they want to do a really, really good job

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Which I can respect

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
So, you know, maybe they're going to wait until the last minute

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
But I'm telling you what, you know, it doesn't take a whole lot

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
And you could win a limited edition Xbox 360 Elite

19:00.000 --> 19:08.000
And it's one of, I think, eight like rare Grand Theft Auto 4 custom paint job type systems

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
That was given from Gamerscore blog to All Games Radio

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Let me remind you how it works

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
We went over it last week, but I'll say it one more time

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
We're going to have a bunch of people submit to us little radio things

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Like, you know how Grand Theft Auto has the little radio stuff in the game?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
How is it in Grand Theft Auto 4? Lots of funny parodies and things that you hear on the radio

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Lots of funny commercials

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, what we want you to do is we want you to make one of those commercials

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
But about Orange Lounge Radio

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
And for the other shows participating in this whole thing

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Like, for instance, All Games Interactive

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
We want you to do one about them

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Bobby Black Wolf, one about him

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
You know, Video Game Outsiders, one about them

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
And so on and so on for all these shows that are participating

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
And if you want a full list, it's available on OrangeLoungeRadio.com and AllGames.com

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
And yes, you can enter at more than one site

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
But you can only be the final qualifier for one

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
So we're going to pick a few that will be voted on by our audience

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
And the winning one that's voted on next week will be the winner

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
They're going to get from All Games a $25 gift certificate to the All Games store

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And an All Games shirt just for qualifying for the final round

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
And then they're going to move on to the final round where they will compete against the final entries from all the other shows

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
And the community at large is going to pick their favorites

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
And that will be it

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
So one entry will win the official Xbox 360 Elite

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
Based on Grand Theft Auto IV from GamerScoreBlog and All Games Radio

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
And hey, there's also a second and third prize

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
I didn't talk about this last week

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
But second place is the Grand Theft Auto IV game for whatever system you want

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And that's courtesy of Mediaspective, one of the other shows on All Games Radio

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
Third prize, $20 points card for your system of choice

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
From the Bobby Black Wolf show, the show that precedes us live here on All Games Radio

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So, 23 bucks

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
And Loki is ineligible for the rules

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
So you don't have to worry about competing against him

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Although he really wants it

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
He really wants it, but he can't have it

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Maybe next time

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Sorry, Loki, them's the rules

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
What can I say?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
Alright, so if you want to send in your entries, mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
Just use our general email address

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
We're separating all the entries in another folder

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Or, if you don't have fancy MP3 recording stuff

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
But you just have a really good idea

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
That might be good enough to win

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Whenever we're not live

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
You can do that either way you want

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
So, there you have it

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
So we hope to get some more entries this week

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
And set people on fire

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Anyway, we listened to one today

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
And I don't think we're going to play it tonight

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
We'll play it for you guys next week

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
We listened to one today

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
Somebody did it out there just for fun

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Because unfortunately he lived in Europe

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
And unfortunately our friends overseas are ineligible

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Because it's an NTSC console

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
He lives in Belgium to be specific

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
And sent us a commercial

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
And I'll tell you what

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
It was so funny

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
I cried, laughing

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
We should use it as our example

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
It was great

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
For what people should do

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
I know, but at the same time

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
I don't want 10 copies of that

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
For people to come up with their own original thing

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Makes sense, right?

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
So we'll play it next week

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
When it's almost over

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And that way you can hear

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
A really good one

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
And then we'll play the other

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Qualifiers for you guys

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Pretty soon

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Alright

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
NintendoManiac64 says

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Does it have to be MP3?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
No, you can use AAC, Wave

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Well, Wave might blow up our inbox

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
As long as Adobe Audition can open it

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Or Winamp, we'll play it

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Just try not to blow up our inbox

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
That's all

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
Alright

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
That's going to do it for housekeeping

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
If you're not already there

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Join our live journal

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Join our MySpace

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Join our Facebook

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Go to our website

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
OrangeLaunchRadio.com

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
And listen to some gaming news

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Courtesy of Loki

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
So yes

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Part of a deal that

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
EA had with

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Milton Bradley

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
They will be publishing

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Monopoly

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
For the Wii, Playstation 2, and Xbox 360

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I think it's kind of funny because

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
EA is trying to get a

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Monopoly on sports games

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Oh

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Karma

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
It's funny

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Har har

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
I see what you did there

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
But apparently this is going to be

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
A sped up version of the original game

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
With some interactive minigames thrown in

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
I don't know

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Doesn't really look like

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
There's going to be a PS3 version at all

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
It's Monopoly

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
What can I say?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
That makes sense because

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Monopoly never ends

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So there needs to be some type of sped up version

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
I mean Monopoly can go

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
I mean Monopoly does end I suppose

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
But it can go on forever

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
I'm not even wrong

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
I mean if this came out on like

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Xbox Live Arcade or something

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
I'd probably pick it up

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
But it's not

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Like it doesn't sound like it is

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Considering it's going to be on Wii and Playstation 2 as well

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
It really doesn't sound like it could be on Xbox Live Arcade

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
It could do retail versions of

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
I mean look at Puzzle Quest

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Okay true

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
I mean anything's possible

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
But I don't know

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Doesn't it seem likely that maybe that's not the route they're going?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Well it is EA

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
They like whoring their shit out so

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
I don't know

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I don't know

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Hey maybe it'll support webcams on 360

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Then you can play Strip Monopoly

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
How does that sound?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Good times

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Not as much fun as in real life

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
And if you play Strip Monop-

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
Monop-

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Monop-

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Monopoly you'll just get bored and pissed off at everybody else before anyone's naked

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
Monopoly is kind of boring after a while

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Strip Monopoly would have to have like lab dances

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
No seriously

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Because you know how you win all of your money

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But you have to have the option of being able to spend it

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
On getting someone to get naked

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Okay here's how you play Strip Monopoly

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Here's my idea for Strip Monopoly

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
You replace the chance and community chest cards

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
Like you know

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
The kind of stuff in there was like lame

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
Like it was like

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
You win second place in a beauty contest

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Collect ten dollars right

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Remember that stuff

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
You need to replace those with x-rated things

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Like

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
You won second place in a crotchless underpants contest

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
That's right

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
Now it's time to show your community chest

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Luxury tax

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Luxury tax

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Anyhow

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
So Monopoly's coming out on all those systems

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
Do you think other board games to follow

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
Can we strip risk in our future

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Well remember I think they were talking

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
You know and they were also talking about making movies of these things too

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
So god I mean

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Battleship would be pretty cool I guess

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I don't know

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Board games have been around forever I mean

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
So much you can really do that's different

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
It's been done like fifty times already

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Gerardo says in chat

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
There would be cheap hotels in Strip Monopoly

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You know what I would like to see as

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
You get houses

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And then you have a by the hour motel

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
That you build

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
Yeah

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
You know what I would like

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
Oh that'd be funny Monopoly Red Light District Edition

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Or something like that

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
I would like to see

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
And this is

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
I don't think this is Milton Bradley

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
But I would like to see them do a

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Like Xbox Live Arcade version of Heroes Quest

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Remember that game was kind of like a halfway between

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Like a board game in Dungeons and Dragons

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Oh yeah kind of yeah yeah

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Or what was that other game

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
They had another game that was like something with

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Volcanoes or something like that

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
And they had little marbles that you could roll down

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
And they would

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Marble Madness

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
No it wasn't Marble Madness

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I don't know

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Marble Madness had things that shot balls

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
Let's see

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
What was it

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
Oh actdeft in chat said

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Risk conquer the world without your pants

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Hey they were bringing out strip DDR

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
That made me think of pantsless rage

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Alright anyhow

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Forget it

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Now the chat room is just going to light up with

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Strip insert board game here

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It's not funny anymore

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Although strip ants in your pants is kind of funny

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah they dump the ants in your pants

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
And you strip to get them out

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Strip don't wake daddy

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Strip hungry hungry hippo

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Alright forget it

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Rob

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
What

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Rob

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
How about more news

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Let's move on and get away from

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Such a

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Such

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Silly

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Teehee

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Nudity chat

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
But naked is great

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Let's get away from

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Teehee nudity chat

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
And talk about violence

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Woohoo

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
And

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
You gotta love

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
A classic violent franchise

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
Called Splatterhouse

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
You remember Splatterhouse

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Yes it was for

27:00.000 --> 27:01.000
Turbo Graphics 16

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Slash PC Engine

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Because the main guy

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Looked like a rip off of Jason

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
I know

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And that game goes sort of annoying sometimes

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Well guess what

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
On the latest cover

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Of EGM

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
They're talking about

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
35 different retro revivals

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
And right there on the cover

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Splatterhouse

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Sweet

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
So Splatterhouse apparently

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Is going to be coming back

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
For a new

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
New wave

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
On all the next gen consoles

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Not a lot else known

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
About the game at this time

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
But I suppose when this magazine

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
Starts floating around out there

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
We'll know a little bit more about it

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Well

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
It was

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
It was

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
The story though

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Was fairly unique

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
From

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
You know

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
The whole

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
The story wasn't a rip off

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Of Friday the 13th

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
Right it talks about

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Splatterhouse has an ancient

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Mayan mask that is

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Strapped onto its corpse or whatever

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Yeah

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And he has to go save his girlfriend

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
So

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Interesting

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
He's probably already dead

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I wonder if it'll be like

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
A first person game

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Probably not

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Because they have the title character

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Right here

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
But

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
No it's probably gonna be

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Another platformer

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Well we'll see what happens

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
More details

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Butcher it

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Butcher characters in the game

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
But don't butcher the game itself

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
We'll see

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Speaking of butchered

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
Not really

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
For our buddies over in Europe

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
They've got a date for a

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Super Smash Brothers Brawl

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
And it's going to be

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
June 27th

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
Also in addition to that

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
WiiWare will be out on May 20th

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
So

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Put it in your diary

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
It's coming

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Put it in your diary

28:38.000 --> 28:39.000
That's what they call it there

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
So I'm calling it

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Oh I see

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
Oh

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
I get the image of like you know

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
A little 12 year old girl

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
Who keeps her diary under her pillow

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
With a little hello kitty key

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
That opens it

28:48.000 --> 28:49.000
We call them planners

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Dear Diary

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
We call them planners

28:52.000 --> 28:53.000
Oh okay

28:53.000 --> 28:54.000
Yes Dear Diary

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Today I pwn some noobs on Smash Brothers

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I beat the shit out of them with

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Princess Peach

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
I want a pony

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
The end

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Dear Diary

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
Today I played Strip Clue

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
It was Miss Scarlet in the billiard room

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
With my

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Never mind

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Let's move on

29:13.000 --> 29:14.000
More stories please

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I don't know if they would consider that

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
Concealed weapon

29:17.000 --> 29:19.000
But it was concealed

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Let's see here

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
So there's a company called Shadowbane

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
What is wrong with this show?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
That's working with

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Nintendo to make an MMO

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
And the question is

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
They didn't really say what the MMO was

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
They were just calling it a

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
As yet unnamed

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
MMO project

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
But people are starting to think

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Hmm

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Perhaps are they developing

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
Animal Crossing for the Wii?

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Or is it just going to be another MMO that

29:47.000 --> 29:48.000
You know

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Just wait until E3

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
I mean enough with the speculation

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
You know what I mean?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
You're not going to find out any more details until E3

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Obviously

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Nintendo runs a very tight run ship

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Where everybody's mouths are sealed

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
And they can't say anything about it

30:01.000 --> 30:02.000
You know no matter who's developing it

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
So just wait

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
I think it's inevitable the game is coming eventually

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
But I think it would be kind of funny if

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
Nintendo surprised us and didn't announce the game at E3

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
But kind of came out of left field with something completely different

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
And which

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
No think about it

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Would you really want an MMO for

30:16.000 --> 30:17.000
Animal Crossing?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah who's to say it's not a completely new IP?

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
You never know

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Mario brother

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Oh Super Mario RPG

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Or Super Mario MMO RPG

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I don't know about that

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
I don't know how you'd make that work but

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Everyone's like plumber class

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Or princess class

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Princess class you know I'd have to play that

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Or Toadstool class

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I don't know

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Huh maybe you're onto something

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Who knows maybe you could do something like that

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
Copyright patentpending.com

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
P.S. money

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
Well I'm sure when the game is to be debuted

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Whatever it is the secret project they're working on

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
One of the places that you're going to be able to see the

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Clips and trailers of it first is the Everyone's Nintendo channel

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
You know that it had come out over in Japan

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
It is coming out in the US

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
It is confirmed this new channel is going to come out in the US

31:09.000 --> 31:12.000
But it's just being called simply the Nintendo channel

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
It will come out at some point within the next month

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
It's coming out around the same time as WiiWare

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Don't know yet if it's going to be the same day

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Or if it's kind of like around that period

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Here's the other interesting thing

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
If you play a WiiWare title

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
For at least an hour

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
And it has to be something that you actually purchased

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
From the channel it can't be a demo or anything like that

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You will get to review the game

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
And I guess your reviews are posted on the Nintendo channels

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
But you have to

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
I think that's interesting that they make you play it for an hour

31:38.000 --> 31:39.000
Before you can review it

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
But that's obviously a good thing

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
So you don't get a lot of crap in there

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
You know what I mean from people just hyped about the game

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
This game made my pants hurt!

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Exactly

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
And anyone can read those reviews

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Of course this channel is going to be free

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
And pretty much all the features that you've come to expect

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
From the Japanese version will show up in this version as well

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So it's just a matter of when this is going to show up

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
But sometime in the next month

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
So that'll be pretty cool

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Sooner rather than later right?

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Now everyone's a critic

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Nintendo's encouraging it

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Well there's something else that

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
Nintendo themselves is going to be criticized for

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
What's that?

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
Well there was a discussion going on with Iwata

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
That was after they've gone through all their

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
You know I guess financial meeting

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
That they go through

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Like any big company has

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
And he's quoted as saying that their

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Projection for the year

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Is not based on hardware cuts

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
And they are not going to need them

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
So translated from corporate to real English

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
That means

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
We're still making money so

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Forget it we're not going to lower prices

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
I wouldn't think that they would lower prices anyways

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
They're having problems keeping enough stock

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
You know for this

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
Hardware for portables and consoles

32:58.000 --> 33:01.000
I mean the demand's not going down for any of them

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
So there's no reason to lower the prices

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
That'd be stupid

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Oh we're sold out of it people just want to buy it

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
They'll buy it for $700

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
Let's drop it to $99

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
Cause we don't like money

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Well there's more

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
So far they've sold 25 million Wii

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
And they've sold 70 million DS's

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
The sales are up 73% for the financial year

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
With 47.7% profit

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
So that's not bad at all

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
And there's some other news that came out

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
They're upping their allocations

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Of what they're going to be making each month

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
For the Wii

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
From 1.6 million units

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
Being manufactured to 2.4 million

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So hopefully that will ease

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
You know the retailers paying out there

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
But I don't think it's enough

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
But they will conquer the world soon

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
Soon

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Another franchise is hoping

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Wait real curious before we hop on to the next story

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
One thing I was kind of curious about is

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
What about you know

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
We knew a couple years ago that inevitably

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
The Wii's were going to come out in all these different colors

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Cause remember we saw the little you know prototypes

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
For the you know the pink Wii and the blue Wii

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
And what have you

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Even though you know they're not going to lower the price of the Wii

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Are they ever going to come out with these different modifications

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Or is that something else they want to pull

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Wait to pull out of the hat

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
I think they're going to

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
That's something that you want to bring out

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
When the demand starts to drop

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
Because people are like

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
You know it gives them another reason to buy the console

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
I don't think that right now

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Until the demand starts dipping down a little bit

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Until they start you know flattening out the demand

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
Versus what they've got in stock

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
I don't think you're going to see any of these new colors

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Or price drops

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Or any sort of like bundles or whatever

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Cause they don't

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
They don't need to entice people to buy them

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
Cause people are already clamoring to buy these things

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
So

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah it'll be a while

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
Well one franchise that's making a return pretty soon

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Which is pretty cool actually

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Is Earthworm Jim

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
They're actually relaunching the franchise

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
They're going to be doing a brand new cartoon series

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
As well as some new video games

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
That are going to be coming to

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Platforms all over the place

35:08.000 --> 35:09.000
Including hopefully

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
PlayStation 2, 3

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And Xbox 360 and Wii

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
And no word yet on

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
You know when this is all going to happen

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
But

35:21.000 --> 35:22.000
Hopefully very soon

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
So we'll see some more of Earthworm Jim

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Probably this year maybe

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
Hmm

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Why do you think all of a sudden they want to bring

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Bring back this one

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
I mean

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
I don't know

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Why bring back Bionic Commando

35:36.000 --> 35:37.000
Or Splatterhouse I guess huh

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I guess retro is all the rage

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
So why not bring back Earthworm Jim

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I know that game always used to crack me up

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
Simply for the fact that when you turned it on

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000
Like remember the title screen

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
It was somebody burping the name Earthworm Jim

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
And it wasn't a bad game either

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
It was kind of cute for a Super Nintendo game

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
That's the system I had it on was Super Nintendo

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Was that one of the games that Tommy Tallarico scored

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Two of the games he's kind of famous for

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Good times

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Well if you have never heard of Earthworm Jim

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
And you've never played it

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
Guess what you're going to have the chance

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
The game is coming to the Virtual Console

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Are going to be somewhat soon

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
There's no date yet

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Going to be coming to the download service

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
But it's the Sega Genesis version of the game

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Not the Super Nintendo version I grew up on

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
But the Sega Genesis version of the game

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Which you know close enough

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Is going to be coming to the Virtual Console

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
By the way just FYI

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Clay Fighter and Boogerman

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Are also on their way out

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Both also the Genesis versions of the games

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Clay Fighter is fucking awesome

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Clay Fighter is pretty rad

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Although it's one of those games

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
I don't know for me like you play it for an hour

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
And then the joke's old

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
You know what I mean

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
It's all about Helga with her opera attack

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
What about Frosty

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Bad Mr. Frosty

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
I used to always play as the blob

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
That was my favorite

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Awesome

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
Bad Mr. Frosty was great

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
Rama says the Genesis version has an extra level doesn't it

37:01.000 --> 37:02.000
Not sure

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
Not sure

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
Well all those games are on their way out

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
So soon we don't have a date

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
But usually when these games are announced

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
There's less than a month to go

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
So there you go

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
Act Deft in Chat real quick says

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
Tigerclaw Tommy Tallarico is working on the new Earthworm gym

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Or so I heard

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Rumor alert

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Rumor alert

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Who are you

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Well

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
You know especially for those of us who are

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Artists who probably found this really hilarious

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
But you know the deal with

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
The Okami we cover with the IGN watermark

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Oh yes the hilarity that ensued last week yes

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
Which is really funny because

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
I don't see why they bother watermarking it in the first place

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
When it's actually Capcom's art

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
So it's sort of like

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Oh we're gonna put our name on it

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
It's ours now

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
No

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Anyway

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
Because of this clusterfuck of craptitude

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Capcom has released two new covers

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
That you can go on their website and

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
What

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
No I'm laughing because I think this is just a stupid idea sorry

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
I just want the covers to begin with because they're pretty

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
But if you go to capcom.com

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Slash art redemption all one word

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
You can pick one of two covers

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
You can actually either get the original or two

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
Special versions that they have

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
One of them is a completely painted

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
Green background with the wolf

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
And a neat looking other side on the back

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
And the other which I personally like

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
It looks like some level artwork with the wolf superimposed in the front

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
You know where the front cover would be

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
And cherry blossoms

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And I like that one better myself

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
I can't stop laughing because the site was called what

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
Art redemption

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Redemption

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Redemption for who

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
And I'm wondering if you don't actually have the game

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
If you can just get one

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
You never know it might make a cute little mini poster

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
You can

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
That's kinda cool

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Oh I think you can

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
But I mean it's just funny I think the thing is silly

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Because honestly how many people are gonna do that

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
When there's the more hilarity of

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
I'm doing it right now

39:16.000 --> 39:21.000
OMG I have the uber rare watermark cover

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
I don't know

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Or even better you just get one of those and you're like

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Oh hey look there's a game spot watermark on there now

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
You never know

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
But hey free game covers

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
And Jamie's ordering one right now even though she doesn't have the game

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
Oh VS Jason SV says they don't ask for a serial number

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
So yes you can do it

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
They don't and I'm ordering one right now

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Nice

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Can you order two? Can you get one for the studio?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.000
No let's you pick one

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
I'll have to go order one too

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
I'm getting the pretty one

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Alright

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
The one with the cherry blossoms

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
I'll get the ugly one then for the studio

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
But I'm gonna let my friend know who really loves this game too

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Very cool

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
So there's some pretty cool mods that are out there right now for Unreal Tournament 3

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Although this one seems to kind of take the cake right now

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Super Mario Brothers

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
They made a Super Mario Brothers Unreal Tournament 3 mod

40:07.000 --> 40:12.000
And what it is basically is it's kind of like a 2D version of Unreal Tournament

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
But with like Super Mario Brother themed levels

40:15.000 --> 40:18.000
So you can run around kind of like I don't know

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Super Smash Unreal Tournament

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
Or something like that

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
But it is available to download off of the Epic Mega Games forums

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
So check out epicgames.com

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Check their forums and you'll find a link to

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
UT2D Super Mario Beta

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
For the PC and Playstation 3

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
So that's kind of cool

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
I hope more games support mods and we see more things like this

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
So and these are things I can download on the Playstation 3?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Yeah

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That's kind of neat

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
So what are the PC mods for Unreal Tournament 3 for the Playstation 3?

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
There's a great niche for the Playstation 3 right there

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
I kind of hope they explore more things like that with the customizations and more games

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
Yeah

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
You know I know we talked about that when this whole game first came out

41:01.000 --> 41:04.000
But to actually see kind of the you know

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Metamorphosis of that is pretty cool

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And this is only scratching the surface

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
I mean think of all the games out there

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Like using the Unreal Engine that they did total conversions for

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
Made a completely different game out of the whole thing

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I mean you're going to see some of these come out

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
And then you're going to actually be able to play these on your Playstation 3

41:22.000 --> 41:25.000
So Unreal Tournament will essentially become like

41:25.000 --> 41:26.000
All these different games

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Which is pretty awesome and definitely worth replay value

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
So

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Hmm

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
Very cool

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
DJ Genai said I played that over at my friend's house

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Good God

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Alright let's do one more story here

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
And then we're going to get into some release dates

41:44.000 --> 41:48.000
But this could affect a lot of different releases coming out soon

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
The Wii end user license agreement was recently updated

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
You know all that legal blah blah blah

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
That usually you don't even read and you just bother to click accept

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
You know just kind of go through it

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
I don't know Jamie do you read every word

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
On those end user license agreements

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Huh

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
You know those things you have to click accept too

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
All the legal blah blah blah

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
I know what you mean and my reply was huh

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Yeah exactly

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Alright

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Well the Wii just recently updated theirs

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
And the interesting thing about it

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
I mean I could read this whole thing but

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You know basically the part you want to know is

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Is that the Wii console and the Wii network service

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
Are not designed for use with any unauthorized device

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
Or any non-license accessory

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
You may not use any such device in connection with your Wii console

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
Or Wii network service

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
If you do it it's illegal avoids the warranty blah blah blah

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
So it's interesting that they updated this to specifically target

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Unlicensed accessories

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
Do you think that has to do with the recent surgeons

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
Of all these fake Mario Kart wheel things we've seen

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
I don't think it has anything to do with that

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
I think if anything it has something to do with the Wii freeloader

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Okay because I was going to say

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I mean I think accessories

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Peripherals it doesn't matter

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Wacko tapes their Wii controller too

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
Exactly it's not going to hurt nothing

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I see so things like the freeloader

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
They're trying to go after

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Well that makes more sense

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Hmm

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I wonder if there's other types of like

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
Controllers out there that help you cheat at games or something

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
I don't know

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Well not in the Wii

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
On the 360 they've got

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
Like I was telling you before the show

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
There's those head in the game controllers

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Where they've made custom modifications

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
That add buttons to the bottom

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
They're remapping buttons and stuff like that

43:23.000 --> 43:26.000
I need an NES advantage update

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Let my NES advantage work with the Wii?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
You know what

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
They should come out with an NES advantage controller

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
You know what I mean there were the official items

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
That had turbo buttons and crap

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
And even NEC got it right

43:39.000 --> 43:42.000
With the turbo graphics and PC engine

43:42.000 --> 43:45.000
That it had a turbo switch on there

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
That you could put it up to three

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
So I don't see what the big deal is

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
With cheats or anything

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Remember on the NES advantage

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
I think it was that one

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
They had a slow button too

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
That was just the start button being hit really quick

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
You know what was great about that?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
What?

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Shooting games

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Like a life force

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Unless every time you hit pause

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
It goes doo doo doo doo doo

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
And then pauses or whatever

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
And then so if you get that

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Like it doesn't work

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
It's horrible

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
You just hear that noise over and over

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
It worked great on like ice hockey though

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
That's what I remember

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
I still have an NES advantage out here somewhere

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I know we used them in one of our photo shoots

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
That we did

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I have one

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
It was fun

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
I also have a robot

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Rob the robot

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Alright well let's get to some release dates

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Let's start over in the UK, shall we?

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Okay

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Stuff is coming out

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Really only two games

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
On the 29th they get Grand Theft Auto 4

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Yippie

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
And on the 2nd of May

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Dream Pinball

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
Which I'm actually more excited about than Grand Theft Auto 4

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And just a few other things

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
That are going to be coming out in the month of

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
That's pretty good is the

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Pool Party

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
No I'm kidding

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It's been listed rock band

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Heading out, Death Junior

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
The Iron Man game

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
And Apollo Justice

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
So you have that to look forward to coming up in May

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
For the US

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
We're getting Baseball Mogul 2009 on the PC

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Toy Shop on the DS

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
Let's Yoga on the DS

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
Let's Pilates on the DS

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Let's not

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Let's Pilates on the DS

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Brain Voyage on the DS

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
Great Wars Nations

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
The Spartans on PC

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
And then let's see

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
On PSP and PlayStation 2

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
Then we've got Iron Man coming out on Friday

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
On PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Wii, PSP, and DS

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
And then a couple smaller games here

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Today we had Mario Kart Wii

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
And on Tuesday

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
We have Grand Theft Auto 4

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
But I'm sure no one's really going to be paying attention to that

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
And that's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
But what the hell is Grand Theft Auto 4?

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Seriously, I haven't heard of that game ever

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Never heard of it

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
Grand Theft Auto 4 is also coming out in Asia

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
That's a general release

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
I usually do Japanese release dates

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
But also some general Asia release dates

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
That are a much broader region

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
However, I am most confident that it's not any type of localized version

46:21.000 --> 46:25.000
It's pretty much just a version of the game

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
From the same one the US and the rest of the world is getting

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
I don't know if Japan is scheduled to get a translated version of the game

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
They got one for the other Grand Theft Auto games, didn't they?

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
I think so

46:36.000 --> 46:37.000
Maybe in the future

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
But they got them way late

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Yeah, they got them way later

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
Just like, hey, same reason we have to wait forever for JRPGs to come out over here

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Same kind of logic, just in reverse

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
So honestly, there is not a whole lot coming out

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Because of the whole Grand Theft Auto thing

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Even though it's not coming out in Japan

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
I don't get that

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
But there is, on the Nintendo Wii coming out in Japan

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
ProYaku Family Stadium is coming out

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
That's baseball

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
This is interesting

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Link's crossbow training

47:07.000 --> 47:10.000
I didn't realize we got it way before Japan

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
But it is just now making its way to Japan on May 1st

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
The Wii Zapper and Link's crossbow training

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Yeah, they aren't missing much

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
Whenever you see the ProYaku, that's baseball

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Baseball, well, who doesn't love...

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Excuse me

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
Excuse me, ah

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
I'm dying

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
I get stuff

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Live radio, Jesus

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Nintendo DS, May 1st

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
A bunch of stuff comes out

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Most of it is just peripherals

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
For instance, you can get a new shiny pouch

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
And a touch pen

47:37.000 --> 47:38.000
In all these different colors

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
However, there are some games coming out as well

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Emblem of Gundam is coming out

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
Katekyo Hitman Reborn, Fate of Heat

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Comes out on the Nintendo DS as well

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
As Anpanman to Asobo ABC Kyoshitsu

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
Anpanman

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Anpanman is great

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
He looks like bread

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Well, he gets his own DS game very soon

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
And on the Sony PSP

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
Nippon no Asoko-de

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
I don't know if that's some type of like

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Japanese traveler game

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
It's coming out from Sony themselves

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
What?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
It means...

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
What?

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
Well, Nippon's Japan

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
No Asoko-de

48:15.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah, that sounds like it would be traveling

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Because it means go over there

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Yeah, it looks like it's like a

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
It shows you

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
I don't know, it looks like SimCity

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
But it actually is showing you

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Actual parts of Japan

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
That's weird

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
This one screenshot I'm looking at

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
Has like all these like power structures

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
And things

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
So I don't know if there's a game in here

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
But it definitely looks like it's using

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Real roads and things

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
So

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
It looks like it could be interesting

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Rob

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
But probably not for us

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
That's probably not something you want to import

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I'm gonna show you what Anpanman looks like

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Alright, you do that

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Post me a link in chat or something

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Oh

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Oh, that's cute

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
I'm gonna link it in the chatroom

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
Because Anpanman's adorable

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Enough cuteness, more gaming news

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
I want Anpanman

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I wonder if they have any

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Actually, Warrior Bob

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Was over in Japan

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Recently

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
And he like IMed me

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
So I told him I wanted an Anpanman plushie

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Really?

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Yeah

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
He asked what

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Cotton game it was I was looking for

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Oh

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
It's really cool

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I thought it was very nice of him to

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Make him come back on the show at some point

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
Well, speaking of the show

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Which I should be paying more attention to

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Instead of Anpanman

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
There's details released about

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Bionic Commando's multiplayer

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
For anyone who is interested

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
Now that is

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Excuse me

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Only gonna be for

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
For a

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Offline play

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
For Bionic Commando re-armed

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But there will be

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
It will be presented in a zoomed out

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
2D sort of mode

49:46.000 --> 49:47.000
You know

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Sort of I guess like the

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Playing, you know, a lot of people in

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Smash Brothers is done I guess

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
You have Deathmatch, Last Man Standing

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
But

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
They say the defining

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Object is gonna be your Bionic Arms

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
You'll have

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
You'll be able to block projectiles

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Grab power-ups

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
You'll have

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
You'll have that as your only weapon

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
And

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
And then

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
They're also saying

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Is that they've

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Made this 150 megabytes

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Also for this size

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
It's gonna have some stuff

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
It will be Live Arcade

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
PlayStation Network

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And PC in May

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Oh yeah and there's one other mode

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
That you have to go around without touching the floor

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
Hmm

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
I'm kind of excited to check out the new Bionic Commando game

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
It's gonna be good times

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
I should call that mode where you don't touch the floor like

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Hot Lava mode

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Remember playing Hot Lava in like

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Kindergarten or like

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
Elementary school?

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
No

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
The hell's this?

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
It's basically you play on like playground equipment

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
And the ground is lava

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
You have one

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
It's like tag

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
But one person is like the lava monster or whatever

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And they have to stay on the ground

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Where everyone else is up on stuff

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
And you have to try to tag them and stuff

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Interesting

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
You're really not up on elementary school

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Recess games

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
You know what after the show let's go play Hot Lava

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I know an elementary school here

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Now

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
That would be a funny commercial for our show

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Well anyways

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
We had better games than that

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
What happens when you take the video games away from the video gamers?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
We took it a step further

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
When we used to have a game of tag

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
That would involve a hula hoop

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
And we'd throw it at each other

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
Because playing like

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
A game like Hot Lava or whatever

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
With a very large piece of playground equipment

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
You can't obviously reach up like

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
12 feet above you

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
But you can throw a hula hoop at someone's head

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
12 feet above you so

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
That was fun

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
We used to make up this game

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
That we would play because we didn't have recess

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
We just had an extended play period

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
Where we would take the hula hoops

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
And throw them and try to capture people

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
But then we would also try to like

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Drag them off and tie them to the

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Tither ball thing

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
It's like a twisted version of Pokemon

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Okay apparently like everybody

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Knows Hot Lava in chat

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
You know what I think there was

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
A game we played that was just like that

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Except it was Sharks

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I think it was Sharks or something like that

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Where everything was Sharks

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
I want to say there was a Type A

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
I remember a tag game that you played on playground equipment

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
But it was like Sharks I think

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Wait real quick I gotta say this

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
You know we all love those playground games

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
From when we were kids

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I remember smear the queer did you guys play that?

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
No I remember a bunch of us got busted

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
What? A bunch of us got busted for playing that one day

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
It was something you played with the football

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
And you know whoever

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Like had the football was the queer

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
And he had to run around

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
This is horrible I know

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
You know the way things turned out

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
You know

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
I don't wish to get smeared on a daily basis

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Anymore but you know that's just

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
I think that's why we got in trouble for playing it

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
We used to play soccer ball

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
We would try to grab that person

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And grab the ball away from him

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
We would put a tennis ball in a sock

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
And throw it at people

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I'm not joking

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
That reminds me of that scene

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
In what the hell was that movie

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
By Kubrick the war movie

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Full Metal Jacket

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Where they all put the soap in the sock

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And start beating the guy with it

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Well the whole point of this is that

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's sort of like crazy dodge ball

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
If you get hit with the sock ball

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
Who gets to throw the sock ball

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
It's pretty funny

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Anyways back on topic

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I want to say

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
We never are on topic on this show dammit

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
They need to compile a bunch of playground

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Games into a game

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
I think it's been done before but not very well

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I want to say they need all these classes

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
But they need it on Xbox Live Arcade

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
And something like

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
Where everybody is competing

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
To be the king of the school yard

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Who wouldn't play that game

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I think it would be fun

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
They should actually do a Simon says one

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
That uses some sort of motion sensor

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Or the wiimote

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So it can tell where you're holding the wiimote

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
It might be fun

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
That would be great

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Hold on

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I gotta get chat comments

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
Rama says the game I was talking about

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
He says Sky that's called a blanket party

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And now a highly illegal thing to do in the military

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
A blanket party

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
Hey guys let's play beach blanket bingo

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Wee

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
So Bionic Commando

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
It's not coming to Virtual Console

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Anytime soon

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Because Nintendo doesn't want it to

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
And that's of course coming from

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Capcom's vice president

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Of strategic planning Christian

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
Svensson

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Who basically says that it couldn't happen

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
It is up to

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Nintendo to allow it to happen

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Apparently

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
The thoughts are maybe they didn't like the fact that

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Hitler's head explodes in the game

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Or the fact that I don't know Hitler's

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
In the game at all

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
He's Mr. D

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
We need a fucking new

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Castle Wolfenstein to come to

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Xbox Live Arcade

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And that would be the shit with multiplayer

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Why don't they just rename him to

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Smitler

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
I know he has another name

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
He was Master D

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
And Bionic Commando

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
It was Hitler

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
But he looked like Hitler

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
You know how there's some cats that look like Hitler

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And there's a whole website dedicated to that

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
This guy looked like Hitler

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Well he was in the Japanese one

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Anyhow

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Something that will be coming to the Nintendo Wii

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
If rumors are to be believed

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
Anyway this is a rumor

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
It was a tip that was sent in

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
To go Nintendo that Metroid Prime

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Is being remade

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
For the Nintendo Wii

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Metroid Prime 3 was already on the Nintendo Wii

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
But the rumor is that 1 and 2

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Are being remade with all

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
New controls and they will all be packaged

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Into one comprehensive

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Metroid Prime game

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Like an ultimate box set

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
If you will for the Nintendo Wii

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Thoughts?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Yeah GameCube port getting some stuck on

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
Waggle controls

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
That sounds like the Wii

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I know it just sounds like a cheap

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Play for more money

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
That would buy it

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Metroid Prime 2 the search for more money

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
I was just thinking that

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
I wonder if they would go back and add stuff to Metroid Prime 3

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
To kind of attract people that might already have it

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Did they do that with Resident Evil 4?

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
How about online?

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
What?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Did they do it with Resident Evil 4?

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Game to the Wii?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
No they didn't give it online play or anything

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
They didn't add anything to it

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
That's right because they don't add anything to ports

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
You know what would be good Rob?

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Is Metroid redone in the style of Metroid Prime?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
No

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Don't touch Super Metroid

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
No

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Super Metroid is a god among men

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
I'm saying it not be

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Of course the same game

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
But I would like to see what some of those levels

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Will look like from a different perspective

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Because I want the music

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
And everything

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
The only redeeming thing they could do ever

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
To Super Metroid is they could do it like they're doing

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
With Bionic Commando

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
And basically just

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
HD version of the 2D game

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Yes please

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
That's one of my dream games

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Not an official OLR dream game

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Not an official OLR dream game

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Because this is not an original concept

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
But I would like to see

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Super Metroid given the Bionic Commando

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Rearmed thing and then made like

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Four times as big a new game

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
That is like four times as big the world

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
It could go from planet to planet

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
They could do that with the Wii

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
If you're pushing just 2D graphics

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Or whatever you can go pretty

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Realistic with that stuff

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
I mean just do it like

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Symphony of the Night or something like that

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Just 2D, why do you have to do everything 3D

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Everything does not have to be 3D

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
Rob, we need an OLR Troid

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Yeah but it's not an original idea

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Neither was Symphony of the Night

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Unless

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Unless they replace Samus with a cat

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Then it's an original idea

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
A cat with a laser

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Exactly

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
That would be actually, I'd play it

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
It should have different laser upgrades as you go through

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Are you suggesting Symphony of the Laser Cat?

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
It wouldn't be a Symphony

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
It'd be more like

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Orchestra of the Laser Cat?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
No, cats yowl

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
It'd be, it wouldn't be

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Operetta of the Laser Cat?

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
It would be

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Laser Cat Operetta

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Okay, it would be

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Screeching matchable laser cats

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Chorus, that's it, chorus

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
Some comments from chat

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Sephiroth1215 says

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
Metroid Prime 1 felt a lot like Super Metroid

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Okay, I disagree with that comment 100%

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Because like, when I played Metroid Prime 1

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
For the first time

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
I seriously, I was like, what the fuck did they do to Metroid

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And I threw the controller, like I did not like

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
Metroid Prime at all when I first played it

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Now granted, I own Metroid Prime 3 now and it's grown

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
On me, the series, but like, I was so

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Mad that they raped Metroid by making it a

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
First player game, because I was not so

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Warm and friendly on the whole first person

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Conversion, but when I really stepped away

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
And just kind of looked at it as a new series, a new game

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I was more comfortable with it

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
But I agree, they need to bring back 2D Metroids

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
So J-Rod says

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
They need to go remake and import Eternal

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Darkness, nevermind this Metroid

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Nonsense, to which Sairan

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Follows up with, somebody take over

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Eternal Darkness is a good idea and give more games

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Insanity gauges

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
You know, well you remember what game

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
It was that I really liked at E3 a few years ago

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
Was that Call of Cthulhu game

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Where you're, what you

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Used to heal yourself was morphine

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
And it could actually end up

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Killing you anyway

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Because you would end up addicted to morphine

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
And then you actually couldn't

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Do part of the game unless you let yourself go crazy

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Drug abuse the game

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Nice

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Some more stuff, how's that

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Anyhow, so the Metroid Prime trilogy

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
May be on its way to Wii

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But we would rather Nintendo

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Just put the resources into giving us a new 2D Metroid

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Of Uberness on the Wii, but we'll see

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Well I'm very mad at Nintendo right now

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Pissed off

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Not up to F you pissed offness

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
But Club Nintendo

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
This elusive thing

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
This, you know

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Wonderful

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Organization is

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Out in

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Australia, not in America

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
For everyone

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Who got their copy

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Of

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
What game was it

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
It was for

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Mario Kart

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
There was an invitation

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
In there with a code on it

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
That you could use

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
To use that code and get

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Nintendo star points

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The site is not active yet

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
But you can

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Get started on your

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Saving up I guess

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Hmm

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Alright

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Give it Nintendo

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Nintendo just needs to give it to us in America already

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Stop being hoarse

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I don't really know a nicer way to say it

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Stop being hoarse, that's awesome

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Earlier this week

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
It's not surprising because

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
With a big game like Grand Theft Auto 4

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Obviously people are

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Going to get early and leak it to the internet

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
As they did, but to commemorate

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Such leakage

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
The notorious

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
BitTorrent site, the Pirate Bay

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Is now calling themselves

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Liberty Bay with you know

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Niko Bellic

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Of Grand Theft Auto 4

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
On the front page there

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
So that's kind of funny I guess

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I love Pirate Bay so much

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Wait a minute, should you be admitting that

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
On this program? Yes, because

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
I'll tell you why I love the Pirate Bay

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
They

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Because of where their servers are located

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
It's not illegal

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
For them to have

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And distribute

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Their content

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
The torrent files Wait a minute, that's where you get your

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Doctor Who fix isn't it?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Hmm

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Okay, okay

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Enough said

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But what's funny is that all of these

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Different facilities will send them letters

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Of complaint and you cease and desist

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And so they publish them on their front page

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And make fun of them

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
And point out

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
What they're doing is

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Legal in the country they're operating

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
From

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And somewhere out there right now

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Ross Steele UT is throwing something at his radio

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
No one has been able to shut them down

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Alright

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Well

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
But just because it's out there doesn't make it right

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
But it makes it awesome

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
And they're hilarious

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
And you know downloading import

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
TV shows is nothing

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
I mean I don't think that should be a big deal

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Honestly

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You know, if they've aired and they're gone

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And you want to get them, why not?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Anyhow, especially if they're never going to air over here

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You know, I think somebody ought to upload

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
A torrent of all this

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
All the old episodes of this

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Or actually, they don't need to

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Because all these episodes are online now

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
This show is fucking bad ass

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I remember this show growing up

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
It was a show, it was hosted by this guy

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I think his name was Jeff something

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
And he had these, I don't know, it's been a long time

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Jeff, crap in the head

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
He had these like totally 80's

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Contestants would come on the show

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And they would play actual arcade games

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
For prizes

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Now a lot of you guys remember this show

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Because it was one of the first shows on G4

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Back when they were actually about games

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
They used to show reruns of this old show

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Back when this game was actually on TV

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I loved watching Starrcade on G4

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And then they got rid of it

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It used to be on Fox 40

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Look, it used to be on Fox 40

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
At like 10am on Saturdays

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
I remember when this game was

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Or when this show was new

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
But if you want to check this out

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
And look at old episodes of the show

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Starrcade.tv, they've posted like 15 episodes

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Of the show if you want to view it

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
And remember the prize

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Which was the big thing about it

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Starrcade machine

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And who didn't want that when they were a kid

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Dude, I'm going to email these people

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I'm going to email these people and see if we can get them on the show

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You know what would be great though

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Is if they were doing it

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I know this was before them

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But giving away the SNK machines

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
With the multi-card

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Dan and I still want one of those

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I want to get them on the show

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Because you know I've got to ask that question

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Will this show ever come back

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Will it blend

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
I know, well you don't have the rights to it

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
You'd have to make up a new video game show

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Whatever, I'd buy the rights to it

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I mean really, what are they going to do, sit on the rights

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It'd be called OL Arcade

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
No

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Patent pending

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Before we get to the classic game of the week

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Xenocore in chat wanted to clarify something

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
About the whole like you know I said the import TV shows

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
On torrents

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Xenocore says, Rob if nobody in the US had

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Distribution rights for a show, it's not illegal

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
To share it online here, hence why

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Fan subs of anime are still around

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Since most fan subs stop their work

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
When the rights are acquired, they are pretty much

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Left alone, interesting

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
It's done out of respect

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And if anything, and this also goes back

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
To the argument of music and stuff

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
If anything those fan subs probably drive up

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Interest in the actual

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Anime title, then when it comes

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Over here, it would probably fare a lot better

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Than say, if it wasn't fan sub

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Dark Tetsuya and

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
ActDeft in chat almost at the same time

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Go OL Arcade

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Instead of Starrcade

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Well, definitely go

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Check out some old episodes of that show and

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Relive the past, because they did some great games

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
On there, good times, especially if

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
You're like under the age of 18

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So you probably weren't even alive when the show

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Was first on the air, you gotta go check out

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Some old episodes, which you were missing

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
There was a time a few years ago that I had actually

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Seriously considered bringing this back

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
As a part of our station

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
But, a little

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Different to not get sued

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
There was just that one show and I can't remember

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
What it was

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
But it was, um

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You'd have like a partner team

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
And they'd go through this trivia business

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
And then they'd get to run through

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
With these velcro jackets

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Oh, I was just reading about

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
That show on wiki the other day

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I was just reading about it, somebody in chat will say it

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
It's not Nick Arcade, it's something else

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
This predates Nick Arcade

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Somebody in chat will say it

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
But I used to watch

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
That show

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
All the freaking time, and I so wanted

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
To be on it

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Video Power

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Credit to Rama

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And there was

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Also GameProTV

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Do you know that GameProTV was filmed right here

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
In Sacramento? Was it? Yes

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
I want to

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
I want to say I read something

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
That they used the Sacramento studios

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
That it was actually produced by the folks

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
With the NBC station around here

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Well, I, um

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I liked that one because that was

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The show that

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
First introduced me to a concept

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
That they never really did anything with

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
That I thought was great

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And I would love to see games actually do this crap

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And that was the save card for the Neo Geo

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Where you could play in the arcade

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Save your data on the card

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And go play it on your Neo Geo system at home

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
If you had the game

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
You could kind of

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I mean to do that with like F-Zero

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Type things, you remember that? Yeah

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I know, it's a little shady, but

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
But I think that bringing back that sort of

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Format for a game would encourage people

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
To purchase the

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Home version too

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
If anything, it would drive sales, I would hope

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
You know what, I'm going to take back what I said earlier

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
By GameProTV, because it says on IMDB

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
They filmed it in Los Angeles, maybe it was just that

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
They did a couple one-off shows, but I want to

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I swear I read something, or maybe I'm getting it

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Mixed up with another popular gaming show around the time

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
So, my bad

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Alright, well, we're awfully reminiscent

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
About classics right now

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
What a perfect time for us to bring in

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Dark Sakura's classic game of the week

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's a chance for us to pay

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Respect to our elders a little bit

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
The elder games, that is

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Dark Sakura's going to sift through her massive archive

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And pick a game to share with us tonight

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Dark Sakura, what have you picked

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
For the masses tonight? I have picked

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Rival Schools, United by Fate

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And I want to play the intro music

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Wait, you want to play the intro music

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Or you want to play the... No, I want to

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Play some of the intro music for everybody

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Because this has the best intro

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Okay, well, give me a minute, because I got to pull up the intro

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Tell them a little bit about the game, then we'll have the intro music

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Well, it's a fighting game, and it's put out by Capcom

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And I love this game so much

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And the name in Japan was

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Ishiritsu Justice Gakuen

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Which means Private Justice High School

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
And you have

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Different students that go to different schools

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Hold on, intro music

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Let's talk a little more about this game

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Oh, well, the other music I picked is my favorite level music

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
The version of this that we had in rotation for a little while

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Was the one I ripped off of my Playstation disc back in the day

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
So

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
It was

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Basically

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
It was a 3D fighter

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And you had a partner

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But there were actually several students that would go out to the same school

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Well

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
It was basically, there were students

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Going missing from the different schools

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
And the students would get together

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
And try to find the people who had gone missing

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And in the arcade there were

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Less characters

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
That actually brought in

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Two of the

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Actually one of them was

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
One of the characters that had been missing

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
And the other one was one of the teachers

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
But they brought those into the home version as well

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
But the game also had Sakura in it

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
As a

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Sort of hidden slash helper character

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Who went to a different school

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
But was friends with some of the other

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Students

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
So it was pretty cool

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
You would also have

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Each person would have their own special attack

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
But you could save up

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Your energy

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
And do a team attack

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Where they would work together

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
There were some of them who had buff attacks

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Where the cheerleader

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Oh god

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
She's so annoying

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
But she'd come up and cheer people on

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Five power bars

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Filled up, something like that

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Or Hinata would come out

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And you know

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Grab your hands and go, you can do it, you can do it

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
And you'd get back some of your life

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Stuff like that

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Or other people would just have attacks

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
It was very very cool

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Very bizarre

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
It's definitely

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
It was very popular

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
But I still sort of think it's more one of the niche fighters

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
In my opinion

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
There were also

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Different counter moves that you could do

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
You know

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
In some cases you could block

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Some certain special moves

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
In a certain way

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
You'd actually have attack cancels

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Where you could

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
If you timed your hit just the right way

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
You could cancel out the other person's attack

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
And then both of them would cancel out

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
But if you are already taking some damage

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
It wouldn't decrease any of it

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
In Japan

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
It came out with an extra disc

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
That was called

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Nekketsu Seishuniki

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Which had a bunch of minigames on it

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And we got the minigame disc

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Except for the biggest notable difference

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
About it was removing the dating sim mode

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
The dating sim mode

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Nice

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Was actually where you were a student

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And you went through a full year of school

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And you made friends with the characters

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And you did all this other stuff

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
And then

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Based on who you made better friends with

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Determined what moves you would get

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
So um

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
When your school year was over

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
You could play your character

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
In versus mode

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
And the moves were like I said

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
They're based on who you were better buddies with

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
And um

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
That was taken out although I did

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
And I spent 90 bucks on this thing

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Because I wanted it so much

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
They released

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
A version 2 that had

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
The Nekketsu Seishuniki mode 2

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
That had a more in depth dating mode

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And had a DDR sort of minigame in it

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Sort of

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
It was like a dance off mode in the middle of high school

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
It was so crazy

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
But um

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
I also remembered that

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
The funniest thing about me playing through this

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Because I knew less Japanese then

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Than I know now

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Was one of the characters asking me

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
When your birthday was and then when you came to your birthday

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
We would bring you presents

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Nice

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It was cool, it was really cool

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
And there was an actual sequel

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Which was Moru Justice Gakuen

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Which we got as

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Rival schools too

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Pretty much

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
They had

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
They actually had a customized character mode

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
But it was a board game

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
It was actually pretty funny

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And you had bitch fight mode

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Is what I call it where you do the little slappy hand fight

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
But the characters in the game

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
There was Batsu, Hinata, Kyousuke, Hayato

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Ron

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Her attacks were using a camera

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
There was Shoma who used a baseball bat

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Natsu who was a volleyball player

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Roberto who was a soccer player

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Nagare who was a swimmer

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
All of his attacks were so stupid

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
He wore a speedo and goggles to attack

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
It was just so many good characters in the game

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It's one of my favorites ever

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Yes

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I was really good at it

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Although my favorite character is the second one

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Who is that?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
That would be this girl

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Who kicks a whole bunch of ass

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
I don't know why I just

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Picked that over me

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Oh, Zaki

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
She wears a really long version

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Of the school uniform

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Wears a mask and fights with a chain

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
She's really fun
