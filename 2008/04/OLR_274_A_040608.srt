00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:23,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight, we say goodbye to Live365, we say hello to AllGames.com, and as always, we make fun of the latest in gaming news.

2
00:00:32,372 --> 00:00:36,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:43,059
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:44,680
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:48,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:49,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

7
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:50,544
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

8
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:52,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

9
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:53,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

10
00:00:54,527 --> 00:00:55,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing okay.

11
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:55,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

12
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:58,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello as well to TechMasterLoki.

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

14
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:00,431
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

15
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:01,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing okay.

16
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:01,712
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

17
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:04,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear you're okay and not crappy

18
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:29,503
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one's here.

19
00:01:29,843 --> 00:01:31,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say goodbye.

20
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,165
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I want to say?

21
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:32,665
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

22
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:33,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck you!

23
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:38,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I sent the official cancellation notice today, so there's no turning back now.

24
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a done deal.

25
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,152
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bastards.

26
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know.

27
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:43,314
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't have upped the rates.

28
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,535
[SPEAKER_06]: But, oh well.

29
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:47,251
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

30
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya Episode 1

31
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:34,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragnarokan

32
00:03:01,221 --> 00:03:08,865
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual, and we have started working on cleaning up the pinball machines because Dan's having a pinball party next Sunday.

33
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,567
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like fun, a pinball party, huh?

34
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:15,749
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a bunch of people over the house, it's like everybody wants to meet you.

35
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:16,930
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, too bad.

36
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,671
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly happens at a pinball party?

37
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:21,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Pizza and pinball.

38
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:22,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

39
00:03:23,013 --> 00:03:24,074
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pretty good.

40
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:27,376
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people talk about their collections and stuff.

41
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,757
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, look how pretty my pinball tables are.

42
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Are people actually going to bring pinball tables over?

43
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:33,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was going to say they're not very portable.

44
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,569
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but we have plenty, I think.

45
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's my question.

46
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:46,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to have not just the pinball machines, but maybe like Pinball FX on the TV on Xbox Live?

47
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:47,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

48
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you can do on Life 365?

49
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:50,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, you can do shit.

50
00:03:52,295 --> 00:03:55,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to suggest that he hook up the Nintendo and put in Pinbot.

51
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:56,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, there you go.

52
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,231
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe we can hook up the TurboGrafx and put in Devil's Crush.

53
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:02,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good idea.

54
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:08,598
[SPEAKER_01]: And he picked up one of those classic collections too, like the whatever super awesome of pinball.

55
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: And to ShadowScyler, I play on Essence RO, but you won't ever find me.

56
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't made the guild yet.

57
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,646
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Sonic Spinball?

58
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:20,448
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do that.

59
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:21,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Sonic Spinball.

60
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was a very strange pinball game.

61
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,438
[SPEAKER_01]: it reminded me of that part of Casino Night where I'd get stuck and get pissed off

62
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:30,886
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, which server do you Ragnarok on?

63
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,381
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I answered.

64
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:02,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that I play on the Essence server.

65
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:04,462
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I was on crack.

66
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:07,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Kanti says, how many pinball machines does DarkSakura have?

67
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:11,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now I have to think about which ones are actually mine because we're holding some for some people.

68
00:05:12,644 --> 00:05:18,105
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ones that we're holding is a Brite of Pinbot, an Indiana Jones that Dan is shopping out.

69
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:25,606
[SPEAKER_01]: We are holding a Back to the Future and a Black Knight, not Black Knight 2000.

70
00:05:25,646 --> 00:05:26,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had that one.

71
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:27,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And then...

72
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:45,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Trek The Next Generation, No Fear, Twilight Zone, Simpsons Pinball Party, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and my machine, World Cup Soccer 94.

73
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:49,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I say Twilight Zone?

74
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:49,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have Twilight Zone.

75
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:51,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

76
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:55,869
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like things have changed a lot since the last time even I was over there.

77
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,090
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

78
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:00,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Loki, how was your gaming week?

79
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,149
[SPEAKER_06]: As he sits down, ready to go.

80
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:07,430
[SPEAKER_07]: My gaming week was pretty brief.

81
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,513
[SPEAKER_07]: I played pretty much just Saints Row this entire week, I think.

82
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:13,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

83
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:18,976
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's finished now, so that's good.

84
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:25,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And, well, I'm still not 100% in the game because I have to do all the damn activities, and some of them are fucking impossible, but

85
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,068
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the story goes, I'm done.

86
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Never knew what the ending was anyway, so.

87
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:37,216
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm glad I'm done so I can start Saints Row 2 when that comes out and Grand Theft Auto 4 and all that fun stuff.

88
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:39,398
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

89
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's a relatively short week for you.

90
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I played a lot of Saints Row.

91
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,883
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we played the death matches during lunch.

92
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:52,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a funny moment where I was driving on the sky in Saints Row because the game is a little glitchy sometimes.

93
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:53,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was fun.

94
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:54,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

95
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, that's about it.

96
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:15,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid, but funny.

97
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,368
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those stupid, funny things.

98
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:20,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously, don't take that too seriously.

99
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The game takes a minute and a half to beat.

100
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides that, really not a lot.

101
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Mr. Driller for like 10 minutes.

102
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,470
[SPEAKER_06]: The new one on Xbox Live Arcade.

103
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

104
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.

105
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:48,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of like, I wonder what version they ported because I was surprised to see, and maybe it's just because it's the mechanics of the game or whatever, but I was surprised to see that the playing field was only a really small portion of the screen.

106
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if maybe that's to support the multiplayer or what have you.

107
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you get to play online?

108
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:53,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is probably a lot more fun.

109
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,724
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm completely basing my judgment off the demo.

110
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:56,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

111
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:19,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play a lot of games this week, but I have a valid excuse.

112
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:21,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll talk about this real quick because a lot of people have been asking.

113
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,194
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why Part B went up on Saturday this week, which is extremely late for Part B to go up.

114
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:30,995
[SPEAKER_06]: We tried to get it up on Wednesday, like Thursday at the absolute latest.

115
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:31,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got something going on.

116
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:40,019
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in the hospital for three days this week, and it was mentioned on OrangeLunchRadio.com, you probably saw that, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.

117
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much I've mentioned it on the live show, but I've been having abdominal pains on and off for the past three weeks.

118
00:08:48,723 --> 00:08:52,086
[SPEAKER_06]: and finally it kind of reached a head on Wednesday.

119
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:58,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I got woken up by some horrendous chest pain and it was like alien is going to pop out of my chest bad.

120
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So I finally just went to the ER.

121
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:03,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of getting the run around from my doctors.

122
00:09:04,619 --> 00:09:09,924
[SPEAKER_06]: They had diagnosed me with pancreatitis but didn't seem to be doing much about it and finally I had to go to the hospital.

123
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:17,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's where I spent about three days pretty much because what I had was acute pancreatitis.

124
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:24,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, my pancreas is fucked up and it was producing too much of a certain chemical and it makes it really painful to eat fatty foods.

125
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:31,077
[SPEAKER_06]: It most commonly happens, funny enough, it most commonly happens in luscious, people who drink a lot, alcoholics.

126
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:33,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 80% of the cases are alcoholics.

127
00:09:33,662 --> 00:09:43,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, while I enjoy the occasional beverage and I talk about it here on this program, I would say drinking one, maybe two drinks a week does not make me an alcoholic.

128
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:44,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So alcohol didn't cause it.

129
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:46,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And being fat didn't cause it.

130
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:54,613
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that maybe the fact that I ate out a lot and all that stuff might have caused me to go to the hospital, but that wasn't it either.

131
00:09:57,194 --> 00:09:59,516
[SPEAKER_06]: My triglycerides were too low for that to be the case.

132
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:00,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

133
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,363
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not the case either.

134
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't know what caused it.

135
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:13,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And now the thing is that, and I don't want to be into too much of a downer syndrome or whatever, but folks have been asking.

136
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:18,717
[SPEAKER_06]: The weird thing is that they did a CAT scan, they did an MRI and all this shit on me in the hospital.

137
00:10:19,397 --> 00:10:22,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some type of cyst on my pancreas, apparently, and

138
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God it's not cancer, says the doctor.

139
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:51,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't mean to bring the show down, but that's basically where I was all week, and since folks have been asking, that's what's up.

140
00:10:52,427 --> 00:10:56,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I find the toughest part of all of it is, A, the fact that I didn't do anything to cause it.

141
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those cases where really they don't know what caused it.

142
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:08,721
[SPEAKER_06]: They think it could be an allergy to the medication I took, although if that's the case, I will be one of the first documented cases of that kind of allergy, like ever, to this antibiotic I took.

143
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,363
[SPEAKER_01]: They also say that stress is a cause.

144
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:12,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that stressed out, though.

145
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:15,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Things are pretty good in my life right now, all things considered.

146
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, the Life 365 thing sucks, but it's not going to cause me to go to the hospital bad.

147
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:20,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

148
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

149
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:22,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

150
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really bad.

151
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:29,860
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, my only thing is I'm always afraid it's going to come back.

152
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,982
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've lost a crazy amount of weight.

153
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:34,304
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past month, I've lost 21 pounds.

154
00:11:35,164 --> 00:11:39,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So, to put it, and you probably notice if you're on Justin.TV because my pants, like, won't stay on.

155
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:41,330
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of sexy.

156
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,010
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

157
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:44,532
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'll stop being such a downer now.

158
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:46,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, coming in clearly I hope?

159
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:46,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

160
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Introduce yourself.

161
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,656
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Drew Nami, of course.

162
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:12,757
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Drew Nami.

163
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:13,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

164
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were here episode one, weren't you?

165
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not here episode one.

166
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,701
[SPEAKER_06]: But you were listening episode one, and now you're here for the last show on Live 365.

167
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:23,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not the last, last show.

168
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember episode one, I was listening from New York.

169
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:27,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah.

170
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:28,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So how was your gaming week?

171
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,205
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get that mic a little closer to you while you talk about your gaming week.

172
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:32,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you move a little closer.

173
00:12:32,706 --> 00:12:35,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened to Irene, so we'll wait for her later.

174
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how was your gaming week?

175
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been on my wild methadone.

176
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:42,019
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so exciting about the most recent Guild Wars expansion?

177
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:08,845
[SPEAKER_05]: and you get a whole bunch of new missions, new skills, basically new everything.

178
00:13:09,186 --> 00:13:12,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And it all leads into... Yeah, they're still saying you're really quiet.

179
00:13:12,568 --> 00:13:13,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and just pick up the mic.

180
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:14,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Just hold it away.

181
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:14,909
[SPEAKER_06]: It's away from your mouth.

182
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio, folks.

183
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:18,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens.

184
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:21,073
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you play on April 1st?

185
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:24,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, did you play on April 1st and everyone was a stick figure?

186
00:13:25,136 --> 00:13:26,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I played on April 1st.

187
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:29,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the reason why it wasn't picking me up was because the mic was off.

188
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:31,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, how convenient!

189
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,445
[SPEAKER_05]: That might have been the problem.

190
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:33,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

191
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:36,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but it's on now.

192
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:36,768
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.

193
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything else in your gaming week?

194
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been participating in one of the X-Fire events for Grand Chase.

195
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:49,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently there's still an open beta and they want people to test it out, so they're doing in-game contests and such.

196
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty good.

197
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,442
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like Smash Bros.

198
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:58,606
[SPEAKER_05]: meets MapleStory, if you can even ponder that as possible.

199
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to miss Live 365?

200
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:04,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am going to miss Live 365.

201
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:06,368
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to miss most about it?

202
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:11,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much listening to 24-7 Station while playing WoW, but both of those are going to be gone.

203
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:14,696
[SPEAKER_06]: You're ditching WoW too?

204
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped playing WoW back in October.

205
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, in favor of Guild Wars?

206
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:21,762
[SPEAKER_05]: In favor of having money.

207
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I ran out of money.

208
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:25,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, I gotcha.

209
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,502
[SPEAKER_06]: WoW is one of the, you know, WoW is an expensive habit.

210
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:33,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably join back up with the new expansion, but... There are ways to play for free.

211
00:14:34,344 --> 00:14:37,485
[SPEAKER_05]: There are ways to play for free, but they all suck.

212
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:38,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Hacksaw servers.

213
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine they're fun at all.

214
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that, but yeah, there are ways to pay for free.

215
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:43,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Lays 2600.

216
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,208
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

217
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:47,309
[SPEAKER_06]: You could steal prepaid cards from the store.

218
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:48,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, on the 2600.

219
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:48,749
[SPEAKER_05]: On the 2600.

220
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:52,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you... No, I hate April Fools.

221
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You can move in a total of eight directions.

222
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:58,557
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I meant in the latest magazine of the 2600.

223
00:14:58,778 --> 00:15:01,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, 2600 magazine.

224
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:02,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that 2600.

225
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,761
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not the Atari 2600.

226
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:07,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were talking about this stupid prank.

227
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:11,045
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's something that has to do with PayPal and crap, so whatever.

228
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, but you have to do it every time you play it, so that's annoying.

229
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:15,668
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

230
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:18,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I love, though, that you have the Horde symbol on your laptop.

231
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:19,533
[SPEAKER_06]: That always makes me giddy.

232
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:22,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I dug this up from some of my old stuff.

233
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I never expected you had a laptop by the time I got this.

234
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:29,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they can see that on Justin TV, our little... All right, awesome.

235
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:33,701
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, turn that mic off when we're not using it, because it makes a lot of clicky-clicky noises.

236
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:36,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, what the hell?

237
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,521
[SPEAKER_06]: My mic is on crack.

238
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,284
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I think that's going to do it for everybody's gaming week.

239
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:45,187
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk a little bit about housekeeping.

240
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:49,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, the only thing on deck is that there is the all games move pending.

241
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:51,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to start on April the 13th.

242
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Love this, by the way.

243
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Allgames.com is rolling out the red carpet for us.

244
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:56,378
[SPEAKER_06]: We love them.

245
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:57,218
[SPEAKER_06]: They're being great.

246
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:06,288
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a little countdown clock on allgames.com that says it counts down the days and hours and minutes until OLR comes exclusively to their station.

247
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:07,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be great.

248
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:08,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So look for us there.

249
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,213
[SPEAKER_06]: The plug will be pulled on Live 365 on the 12th.

250
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be taking the horse out to the barn and shooting it on Saturday.

251
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:42,265
[SPEAKER_01]: They will become glue.

252
00:16:42,845 --> 00:16:45,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we make fun of it here.

253
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:51,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Even some folks in chat were commenting earlier like, boy, they sure sound like they're going to miss the 24-7 feed.

254
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:52,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We are.

255
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:53,549
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to miss it.

256
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:56,030
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you know what?

257
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,572
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like one of the songs in the pre-show tonight, which had a very tongue-in-cheek theme tonight if you were listening to our little pre-show music.

258
00:17:02,072 --> 00:17:03,173
[SPEAKER_06]: A change will do you good.

259
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:06,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is going to be something new for us.

260
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be fun.

261
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:08,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that.

262
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:23,074
[SPEAKER_06]: uh Zappy says will there be punch at the plug pulling punch and pat punch and pat but not alcoholic punch because I don't want to go back to the hospital with more pancreatitis please not that

263
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:26,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're excited though about AllGames.com.

264
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:37,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't have the final word for you on Travis and DMN and all that, but if I had a Magic 8-Ball and I shook it, it would say Outlook looks good.

265
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:43,429
[SPEAKER_06]: They're probably going to come over a little later than us, but we'll be there on Sunday the 13th.

266
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:44,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited.

267
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:45,811
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

268
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:47,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough housekeeping.

269
00:17:47,472 --> 00:17:50,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into gaming news that we can taunt and make fun of.

270
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:51,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

271
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so this is pretty awesome.

272
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been rumored to be happening, but finally official now.

273
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam and Max are coming to the Wii.

274
00:18:00,568 --> 00:18:04,429
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, it's being brought to us in the U.S.

275
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,711
[SPEAKER_07]: by Dreamcatcher and, of course, the Adventure Company.

276
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:11,152
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Europe, Joe Wood, of course, is publishing it there.

277
00:18:14,073 --> 00:18:16,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really any word on what exactly it will include.

278
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:20,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably, you know, a lot of the episodes that we saw on the PC...

279
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:24,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't know if maybe it's a compilation of Season 1, maybe something like Season 2.

280
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:25,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

281
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:29,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's even like... No, it's not going to have download content on the Wii.

282
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,840
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I don't know.

283
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome, though.

284
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So, glad to be able to play some Salmon Max since I don't use GameTap.

285
00:18:39,403 --> 00:18:40,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Or want to buy software.

286
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:43,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's going to be going to WiiWare?

287
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:46,486
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's actually going to be going to the Wii.

288
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:47,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so it's not WiiWare.

289
00:18:48,087 --> 00:18:50,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember there was a rumor a while back that it was going to go to WiiWare.

290
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:55,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they could do it that way, but I don't think they would.

291
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:59,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'd just be, you know, maybe like the first season or something like that.

292
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:11,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be, I mean, if they package all the games together into like one, because the games themselves are only like three to four hours long, but if they package, you know, the entire first season, which was like eight episodes, I want to say?

293
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:13,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember off the top of my head.

294
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:15,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they could do the first and second season or something like that.

295
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:15,799
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be good.

296
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:23,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a great deal because that would be, you know, you'd probably have like at least 15 episodes all together in one place.

297
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a pretty good deal.

298
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:26,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I had it turned on and pointed at me.

299
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:28,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably going to play it, if I don't have to buy it.

300
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,852
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf says the first season is 6 episodes and the second season is 5 episodes.

301
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:01,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, that's not a bad deal.

302
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:22,662
[SPEAKER_06]: for 11 episodes.

303
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:26,086
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a 30-40 hour game.

304
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:27,247
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the size of most games.

305
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,229
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be a good deal.

306
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,633
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also going to be a good deal.

307
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:34,495
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be a Super Smash Bros.

308
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:35,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl sequel.

309
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:37,158
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also kind of a duh.

310
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:47,941
[SPEAKER_06]: but at the same time, it would be interesting if a Brawl sequel came to the Wii because if you think about the previous Nintendo consoles, they only had one Smash Bros.

311
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:48,542
[SPEAKER_06]: game apiece.

312
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:51,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo 64 had that Smash Bros.

313
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:58,890
[SPEAKER_06]: game, which I want to say was originally developed for the Super Nintendo but was brought over to the 64 when the console life switched up a little bit.

314
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,952
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the GameCube had one.

315
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the Wii has its one.

316
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be kind of weird if there was a second one on the Wii.

317
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:07,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think Nintendo plans to move away from the Wii anytime soon.

318
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:09,539
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be kind of interesting if we got a sequel.

319
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,180
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the basis for this?

320
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:21,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Nintendo is, in one of their latest surveys, they do these surveys all the time on their website, they're asking a question about how likely would you be to buy a sequel to Super Smash Bros.

321
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl on a scale of 1 to 7?

322
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,271
[SPEAKER_06]: One being I wouldn't buy it.

323
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:27,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven being I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

324
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure most people are saying seven, seven, seven.

325
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:32,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know many people who wouldn't say seven.

326
00:21:32,616 --> 00:21:33,336
[SPEAKER_06]: But it would be interesting.

327
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:37,178
[SPEAKER_06]: What else can they do with Smash Bros.

328
00:21:37,238 --> 00:21:37,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl?

329
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,100
[SPEAKER_06]: A DS version?

330
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, there you go.

331
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:43,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet that's it.

332
00:21:43,922 --> 00:21:45,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet that's exactly what they're going to do.

333
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it'll be a DS version.

334
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:52,307
[SPEAKER_06]: You think if there was a DS version it would be just a dumbed down same version you kind of have on the Wii now?

335
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:52,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think they'd...

336
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually take the time to make something kind of new, maybe with some more DS-centric characters.

337
00:21:58,182 --> 00:22:01,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, keep in mind the DS is basically a handheld Nintendo 64.

338
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:02,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

339
00:22:02,925 --> 00:22:07,388
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd probably be more like a throwback to the old Smash Bros.

340
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:08,008
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

341
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:13,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course they're going to whore this out, but I don't think it's going to come anytime soon.

342
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:17,935
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it'll be at least maybe a year or two off if they're going to do something like that.

343
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:22,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaded in chat says the PictoChat level where you can draw your own pics.

344
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:23,464
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be kind of fun.

345
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:27,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet the online seems to work a little better on the DS than it does on the Wii.

346
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet online would work better.

347
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:30,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess.

348
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:34,087
[SPEAKER_01]: The PictoChat level would be full of like cocks or something.

349
00:22:35,127 --> 00:22:35,747
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt.

350
00:22:35,867 --> 00:22:39,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not too confident with Nintendo and their online.

351
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:44,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Ross Steel UT says I say we bring back the Virtual Boy with Smash Brothers.

352
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:45,309
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

353
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

354
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not want a migraine.

355
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:49,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless it's a playable character, that'd be cool.

356
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:50,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I would not mind the migraine.

357
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,013
[SPEAKER_07]: They should do a Super Nintendo version of Smash Bros.

358
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:53,634
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool.

359
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:54,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

360
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:55,417
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.

361
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:57,060
[SPEAKER_07]: The system's like dead and gone.

362
00:22:57,801 --> 00:22:59,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's as dead as this station.

363
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:02,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring it on to the DS.

364
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:03,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Do all 2D.

365
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I would believe that a Smash Brothers would come to DS.

366
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:12,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a Smash Brothers game in the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 engine or something like that.

367
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcade Smash Brothers.

368
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:17,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that'll be the thing is they'll get third parties on board.

369
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:17,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

370
00:23:17,723 --> 00:23:18,163
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

371
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:22,325
[SPEAKER_06]: But regardless, I'm sure this survey is a no-brainer.

372
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:23,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on who they're surveying.

373
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,867
[SPEAKER_07]: If they surveyed us, I'm sure we'd all be saying... Why do you waste money on a freaking survey like that?

374
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Would a sequel sell for a really popular game?

375
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:32,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

376
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,929
[SPEAKER_05]: In other news, water is indeed wet.

377
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and Jamie, just think of the Virtual Boy possibilities.

378
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,190
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have the Teleroboxer stage.

379
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,170
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

380
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,651
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

381
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:45,491
[SPEAKER_01]: The migraines are not worth it.

382
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:51,573
[SPEAKER_01]: My Virtual Boy is sealed in foam in a plastic case, never to be opened again.

383
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:53,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play Virtual Boy.

384
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:55,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played one in years.

385
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:56,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like 12.

386
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:56,902
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring it next week.

387
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:58,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I played one at Blockbuster once.

388
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,523
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one of the ones that Blockbuster was selling.

389
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we have the nice hard case and everything.

390
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:04,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we hook up Virtual Boy to Justin.TV somehow?

391
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:06,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Have the headache cam?

392
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:06,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

393
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It wouldn't be easy, but you could do it.

394
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:09,807
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be fun.

395
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:13,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I say we should have some type of competition with the Virtual Boy.

396
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:16,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Like who can play the longest without having a seizure?

397
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:16,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Throwing up?

398
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Or throwing up?

399
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:25,070
[SPEAKER_06]: and Cheeseburger in chat asks the definitive question, if Chuck Norris was in Brawl, what would be his final smash?

400
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:28,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Overused joke.

401
00:24:29,975 --> 00:24:33,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you know that that hand is actually Chuck Norris' hand?

402
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to the next story, please, before the Chuck Norris choice.

403
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:37,303
[SPEAKER_06]: God, you guys are chinging to me.

404
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:38,885
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

405
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:54,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, there is actually, for anybody who has been waiting, and I know lots of people have for Mario Kart Wii, there's going to be a really awesome launch ready for it at midnight on the verge of the 26th to the 27th.

406
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:56,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess where it's going to be?

407
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:57,395
[SPEAKER_06]: My pants.

408
00:24:58,116 --> 00:24:58,356
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

409
00:24:58,616 --> 00:24:59,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam's Club!

410
00:25:00,617 --> 00:25:03,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Because no one knows how to get down like Sam's Club.

411
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:06,240
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Sam's Club and they'll even have

412
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,403
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 Wii consoles on hand.

413
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:13,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Will they have the ladies serving the samples of the little teeny weenies?

414
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I would go just for that.

415
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:21,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Would they forget to mention those 15 Wii consoles are being sold together in like a giant family pack of Wiis?

416
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:28,888
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's the Wii plus like 50 controllers and shitty games and a box of Froot Loops.

417
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:32,608
[SPEAKER_07]: The Sam's Club actually realized that they're not a club and they're just a store.

418
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:35,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And a two-gallon container of mayonnaise.

419
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, when you think video games, you think Sam's Club.

420
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,831
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought the Vio at Sam's Club.

421
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:46,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my question.

422
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:49,072
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all Sam's Clubs that are doing this or is it just a few?

423
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:53,993
[SPEAKER_01]: It's saying... It's not actually saying a few.

424
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,313
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just saying Sam's Club.

425
00:25:55,974 --> 00:25:59,335
[SPEAKER_06]: We should party down at Sam's Club.

426
00:25:59,355 --> 00:25:59,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I'm thinking.

427
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:05,078
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is at every Sam's Club, we go to the Sam's Club out in freaking Roseville, okay?

428
00:26:06,035 --> 00:26:07,795
[SPEAKER_06]: because Roseville knows how to get down.

429
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:10,196
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of retired people out in Roseville.

430
00:26:10,676 --> 00:26:13,197
[SPEAKER_06]: What we'll do, we'll go there and we'll dress to the nine.

431
00:26:13,217 --> 00:26:15,837
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll dress in party hats and boas.

432
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:22,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We have those hats, the little Mario hats that Ranma gave us some time ago.

433
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:24,400
[SPEAKER_06]: We can wear our little hats.

434
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:24,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

435
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Count me in.

436
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,980
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

437
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,601
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're doing it, we've got to do that.

438
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,281
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

439
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:31,581
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

440
00:26:32,282 --> 00:26:33,922
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just have my copy the day it comes out.

441
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:36,559
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to go party at Sam's Club?

442
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:37,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Come home with Smash Brothers.

443
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, two gallons of mayonnaise, Jamie.

444
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:40,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

445
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:41,123
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

446
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:41,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

447
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:42,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

448
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:42,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

449
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:43,565
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

450
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, are you down with the Sam's Club party?

451
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:48,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

452
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:50,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably already have the game by the time the thing launches.

453
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,211
[SPEAKER_06]: God, you people are no fun at all.

454
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:53,312
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't go for the game.

455
00:26:53,372 --> 00:26:55,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I stood in line for a Wii.

456
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:56,975
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I get excited about Sam's Club?

457
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:57,636
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the point.

458
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:58,797
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the point.

459
00:26:58,857 --> 00:27:02,940
[SPEAKER_01]: We took our lawn chairs and sat in line for our Wii.

460
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:07,912
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll probably go there and be like, sorry, we're not doing the launch party, and be like, crap.

461
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:12,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go, and you know why, because I have nothing better to do.

462
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Will anyone go party at Sam's Club with me?

463
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:24,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you don't want to go to Sam's Club to get Mario Kart, maybe you want to go to Japan to get Trauma Center 2.

464
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:28,151
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, the game is actually being slated for the DS.

465
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:29,132
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming back.

466
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:33,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the second opinion wasn't really a sequel then.

467
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:46,145
[SPEAKER_07]: But Trauma Center 2, and I guess the sequel has Dr. Stiles and Nurse Angie tackling the effects of the unanswered mysteries of the guilt virus from the prequel.

468
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:47,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

469
00:27:47,861 --> 00:27:48,622
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

470
00:28:08,717 --> 00:28:21,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Trauma Center is one of those games where I swear it's one of those blink and you miss it kind of games, but it's a quote, an epic story that once aired on the station and on the nightly news here and locally.

471
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:22,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so much fun.

472
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Trauma Center is so much fun.

473
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I like making them die.

474
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:30,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I do too.

475
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,684
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love the whole bringing him back to life.

476
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:36,526
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii controls in that game are really cool.

477
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:41,289
[SPEAKER_06]: When you have to do the whole... Defibrillator.

478
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:42,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the defibrillator.

479
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,252
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to push into the screen, onto the body.

480
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:45,972
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny.

481
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:46,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Trauma Center.

482
00:28:48,112 --> 00:28:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think you of all people, Loki, would, like, Trauma Center would be one of your favorites.

483
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:58,237
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I liked it better when it was called Life and Death and came out, like, early, early, early PCs back when they had Windows 3.1.

484
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Life or Death was hardcore.

485
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,980
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody, and the only, like, surgeries you'd do would be removing appendixes.

486
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Life or Death was hardcore, though.

487
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:11,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, if you screwed up in that game, you were killing patients left and right.

488
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:11,543
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very hard game.

489
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:16,625
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's called Life and Death, and not Life and maybe... They should have called it Life but Mostly Death.

490
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:18,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what that game was.

491
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:20,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, I'm going to scribble with the scalpel.

492
00:29:20,506 --> 00:29:23,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to, like, read all this stuff before you go and do the surgeries.

493
00:29:23,768 --> 00:29:24,708
[SPEAKER_07]: But we didn't like to read.

494
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:25,748
[SPEAKER_07]: We just wanted the scalpel.

495
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:29,150
[SPEAKER_01]: In Trauma Center, you... Calteepa makes the best suggestion.

496
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: In chat?

497
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,230
[SPEAKER_06]: What did he say?

498
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychological Trauma Center.

499
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:34,832
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be kind of rad.

500
00:29:34,852 --> 00:29:34,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

501
00:29:36,893 --> 00:29:37,213
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

502
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,453
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what else is going to be... What?

503
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:42,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, oh, no, I have to repair your daddy left you or something.

504
00:29:43,468 --> 00:29:47,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Dennis Leary Shut the fuck up by Dr. Dennis Leary

505
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:04,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, look, let's move on to games I definitely want.

506
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:07,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want Trauma Center 2, but I definitely, definitely want this.

507
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:16,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually surprised to hear that Final Fantasy 4 was not already confirmed for North America, but then again, this is Squeenix we're talking about.

508
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:25,892
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently this week, Final Fantasy 4 director Takashi Tokita did confirm that Final Fantasy 4 is being localized for North America.

509
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,732
[SPEAKER_06]: That was in the latest issue of Nintendo Power.

510
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wait, scratch that.

511
00:30:30,013 --> 00:30:37,518
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't actually confirm the localization, but, I mean, there was English language screenshots in the article.

512
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,060
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the cover of the freaking magazine.

513
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's safe to say the game's coming out over here.

514
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:45,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's safe to say the game's coming out here.

515
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:48,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't know it or anything.

516
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you know about when the game is coming out here by chance?

517
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:53,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say it's coming out around here...

518
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:56,944
[SPEAKER_06]: In time for my birthday?

519
00:30:58,205 --> 00:30:58,545
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

520
00:30:58,745 --> 00:30:59,405
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it!

521
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:02,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get you what I was going to get you for your birthday.

522
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:05,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I don't remember when your birthday is, unfortunately.

523
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:06,167
[SPEAKER_06]: June 26th.

524
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:06,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget it.

525
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:06,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

526
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be out for my birthday?

527
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:09,248
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

528
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:10,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it be out in July?

529
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:11,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

530
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:13,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we play Hot and Cold?

531
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it July 15th?

532
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:17,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Warm.

533
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:19,091
[SPEAKER_06]: July 17th.

534
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Warmer.

535
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:21,692
[SPEAKER_06]: July 19th.

536
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:23,213
[SPEAKER_06]: No, still warm.

537
00:31:23,913 --> 00:31:24,233
[SPEAKER_06]: July 18th.

538
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,138
[SPEAKER_06]: What's a Tuesday?

539
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:26,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

540
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Pulling up a calendar.

541
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,520
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we get Loki to tell us secrets now.

542
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,121
[SPEAKER_06]: July 22nd.

543
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:34,221
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

544
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,381
[SPEAKER_06]: July 15th.

545
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:36,222
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

546
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they putting it on a Sunday or something?

547
00:31:38,202 --> 00:31:38,923
[SPEAKER_06]: July 20th.

548
00:31:39,883 --> 00:31:40,523
[SPEAKER_06]: No, further.

549
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:41,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it.

550
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:42,644
[SPEAKER_07]: It's close to August.

551
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:43,704
[SPEAKER_06]: July 29th.

552
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:44,885
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

553
00:31:45,465 --> 00:31:45,725
[SPEAKER_06]: God.

554
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:46,845
[SPEAKER_06]: July 27th.

555
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's at the end of July.

556
00:31:52,547 --> 00:31:54,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the only game coming over here.

557
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:54,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what else?

558
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, just another game Is it Chrono Trigger?

559
00:31:58,843 --> 00:32:00,044
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not Chrono Trigger Is it Chrono Trigger?

560
00:32:00,064 --> 00:32:06,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another DS game that's already in Japan right now That I'm showing you the title for Can I please say that on air?

561
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:12,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead Dragon Quest V Yeah Wait, what?

562
00:32:13,096 --> 00:32:17,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest V That's apparently getting localized as well Excuse me for a second Should be fun

563
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you just squee in your pants?

564
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:21,742
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was that noise?

565
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:23,043
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just squeed into the mic.

566
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:23,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

567
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:32,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's another game coming out, too, the same day as Final Fantasy 4, but it's not for the DS.

568
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:42,975
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a 360 RPG that's by Square Enix, although it's got the weirdest title ever, Infinite Undiscovery, so that should be coming around the same time.

569
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:46,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of stuff could move, so...

570
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest V, Final Fantasy IV in July

571
00:33:17,148 --> 00:33:18,549
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a Square Enix game.

572
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,570
[SPEAKER_01]: That was Nintendo themselves.

573
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was Nintendo.

574
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:23,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastard Nintendo.

575
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,634
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I call them now for not bringing that over here.

576
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:26,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastard Nintendo.

577
00:33:26,854 --> 00:33:27,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they did.

578
00:33:27,455 --> 00:33:28,155
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out over there.

579
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not here?

580
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,697
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with that, Nintendo?

581
00:33:31,657 --> 00:33:34,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the same people that own Nintendo own Life 365.

582
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take a detour for a minute to say hello to Rice Princess, who showed up 39 minutes late.

583
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:41,384
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

584
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good and late, how about you?

585
00:33:44,142 --> 00:33:44,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

586
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, I got you a present.

587
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:48,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then I forgive you for being late.

588
00:33:48,606 --> 00:33:50,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, ooh, is that it for me?

589
00:33:50,648 --> 00:33:51,829
[SPEAKER_03]: This is it for you.

590
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that looks so pretty.

591
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,111
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of random.

592
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:57,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but they were on sale, and I'm like, oh, they have penguins, I'll be like it.

593
00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:00,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Floor mats for the car with penguins on them, they're so cute.

594
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:01,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, woohoo, yay.

595
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I accept your gift.

596
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo, in lieu of being late.

597
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Your offering pleases Kitty.

598
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:07,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells like new car.

599
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:10,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's weird.

600
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say one other thing.

601
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a Captain Crunch malt from Carl's Jr.

602
00:34:17,704 --> 00:34:20,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so fucking, I mean, flipping good.

603
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:21,205
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we can cuss.

604
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:22,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking good.

605
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:23,605
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free radio.

606
00:34:24,705 --> 00:34:25,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, it's so yummy.

607
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:27,506
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to do?

608
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Cancel us?

609
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:30,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you cannot be on our station anymore.

610
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:32,467
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's pretty good.

611
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:34,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, okay.

612
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:40,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should try to set some sort of Guinness Book of World Records for the most time fuck has occurred in a podcast.

613
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The Fuck Show

614
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:12,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, we'll lose all of our listeners in one shot.

615
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:15,828
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do it South Park style.

616
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:20,269
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have one of those little click counters in the corner of the Justin TV feed.

617
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do it, we'll do it.

618
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby, fuck show, why you're in?

619
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's in chat right now.

620
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to Nathan, who's here.

621
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

622
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:31,692
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

623
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:33,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I am fine.

624
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:37,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the Captain Crunch milkshake flippin' fantastic?

625
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,039
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

626
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It was?

627
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Glad to hear it.

628
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't drink it or it might kill me.

629
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:42,902
[SPEAKER_06]: I still haven't had it yet.

630
00:35:42,942 --> 00:35:46,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I have to stay away from high-fat foods for a month.

631
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:50,385
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they had Captain Crunch Jell-O, I'd be all over that shit.

632
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:52,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make you.

633
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

634
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:56,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, you should have a smoothie.

635
00:35:57,308 --> 00:35:58,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Wolf says, why?

636
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:00,610
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck show it is.

637
00:36:01,894 --> 00:36:03,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So what night is that?

638
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:04,935
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be April 13th, it would be the 20th.

639
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:08,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be the show the day after my birthday.

640
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:10,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, fuck, I'm in.

641
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:14,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great idea because I'm going to be gone most of that week.

642
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,001
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to come for my birthday stuff, right?

643
00:36:17,021 --> 00:36:18,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't, I'm going to be out of town.

644
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:20,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

645
00:36:20,382 --> 00:36:21,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyway.

646
00:36:22,867 --> 00:36:23,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll figure something out.

647
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:26,368
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be our late April... Oh my God, the show is on 420.

648
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:27,829
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be a fuck show.

649
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:28,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

650
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:29,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

651
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:29,709
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

652
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough about the fuck show.

653
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, brownies?

654
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Irene had enough time to go to the bathroom and back and we're still talking about the fuck show.

655
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:36,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

656
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:37,772
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be on 420.

657
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:40,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to be like a really slow, mellow fuck show?

658
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:41,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, hey, man.

659
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:45,115
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it'll be... No, it'll be... Here's the deal.

660
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:45,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the rule.

661
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:47,396
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the rules for the fuck show.

662
00:36:47,476 --> 00:36:48,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

663
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:49,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

664
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: 420 is marijuana day.

665
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:51,117
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not...

666
00:36:51,617 --> 00:36:52,398
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.com.

667
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can work the word into the show?

668
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:39,990
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

669
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:08,167
[SPEAKER_01]: is Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo's Dungeon will be coming out in the summer over here and it's happy and makes me go squee and it'll be $39.99.

670
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:12,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about time.

671
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:15,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It's essentially the game that was on the DS.

672
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Like already.

673
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:18,869
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're getting a DS port on the Wii now.

674
00:38:18,909 --> 00:38:20,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think it may be remade a little bit.

675
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Wii is like the porting system.

676
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,451
[SPEAKER_06]: First it was all our PS2 games get ported with Waggle.

677
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're getting DS games.

678
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess that's nothing new.

679
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:28,191
[SPEAKER_06]: We had Cookin' Mama.

680
00:38:29,152 --> 00:38:30,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cute and it goes quee.

681
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:34,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to buy the game just because the Chocobo goes, Yeah.

682
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:36,636
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

683
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:40,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, will you hack the game so the Chocobo goes, Fuck.

684
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:43,702
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know how to do that.

685
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:45,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

686
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:46,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

687
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:55,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so it's been recently discovered that Konami has trademarked a new name for a Castlevania game.

688
00:38:56,138 --> 00:39:03,603
[SPEAKER_07]: The title of the game, which is assumed to be for the DS, is Castlevania Order of... Man, I can't even pronounce the rest.

689
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like Ecclesia.

690
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:07,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Ecclesia, yeah, that's right.

691
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:09,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Order of Ecclesia.

692
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a musical term?

693
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:14,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought all the Castlevania games had to have music in them.

694
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:17,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Portrait of Runa.

695
00:39:17,112 --> 00:39:19,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Has to be something artsy and this one's more like logic.

696
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:21,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Ecclesia.

697
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:22,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Ecclesia.

698
00:39:23,057 --> 00:39:23,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

699
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:25,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Not making up words.

700
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:38,368
[SPEAKER_07]: I suspect that this game will have someone in the Belmont family fighting a vampire, probably Dracula, and there will be whips of some sort and possibly magic and hearts and stuff.

701
00:39:38,688 --> 00:39:39,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, hold on.

702
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm using my mind reading techniques right now.

703
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:43,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Something tells me

704
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:49,929
[SPEAKER_06]: This game will have holy water as a weapon.

705
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,530
[SPEAKER_07]: And crosses.

706
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:52,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and crosses.

707
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:53,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe daggers.

708
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,251
[SPEAKER_06]: And an axe.

709
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:58,232
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the characters will have a whip.

710
00:39:58,992 --> 00:40:00,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop giving your nonsense.

711
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:04,253
[SPEAKER_06]: You heard it here first, I'm telling you.

712
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:08,814
[SPEAKER_03]: When are they going to have a Castlevania game where you fight the Belmonts?

713
00:40:09,555 --> 00:40:10,955
[SPEAKER_02]: They have had one, Symphony of the Nights.

714
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:12,863
[SPEAKER_02]: You fight the Belmonts?

715
00:40:12,903 --> 00:40:13,584
[SPEAKER_02]: You fight Richter?

716
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:14,264
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

717
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:15,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that at the second castle?

718
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:18,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of, but he's not like the main boss.

719
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:21,786
[SPEAKER_03]: He is unless you go do the thing where you have to go fight Shaft.

720
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:22,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he is the main boss.

721
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally, if you're not wearing the sunglasses.

722
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:26,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

723
00:40:26,788 --> 00:40:28,268
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only time he actually is.

724
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:29,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's Arya of Sorrow.

725
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:30,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play that one.

726
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:32,389
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a boss, though.

727
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Richter is awesome.

728
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I like his Ryu look and Rondo blood.

729
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:42,948
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them!

730
00:40:43,729 --> 00:40:47,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, because you always fight Dracula or something like that.

731
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:48,991
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, come on.

732
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Castlevania.

733
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:53,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Dracula fucks up the Belmont family reunion.

734
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:54,395
[SPEAKER_07]: DS.

735
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw yeah, Dracula's gonna fuck you up.

736
00:40:56,776 --> 00:40:59,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really been into the Castlevania series on the DS.

737
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:00,378
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

738
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:00,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

739
00:41:07,224 --> 00:41:09,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the 3D Castlevanias.

740
00:41:10,307 --> 00:41:11,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're okay.

741
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:11,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, 64?

742
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:14,890
[SPEAKER_03]: No, like Lament of Innocence.

743
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

744
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Curse of Darkness.

745
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:17,752
[SPEAKER_03]: They're okay.

746
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I like my 2D Castlevania.

747
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:20,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I understand that.

748
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:21,354
Yeah.

749
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:31,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, despite whatever it is they're putting out on the DS, it's working because Nintendo is supreme when it comes to Japanese hardware and software sales.

750
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:35,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is per the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.

751
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,642
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nintendo DS and the Wii have sold 6.3 and 3.7 million units.

752
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,983
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 6.3 million for the DS, 3.7 for the Wii.

753
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:47,185
[SPEAKER_06]: And Wii Fit is selling like crazy in Japan, 1.76 million units.

754
00:41:47,625 --> 00:41:50,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo has the top five spots in software.

755
00:41:51,326 --> 00:41:52,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Smash Bros.

756
00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:53,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl, and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

757
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the top five games.

758
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hate on Pokemon.

759
00:42:24,387 --> 00:42:24,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't hate.

760
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:26,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate as much as I want.

761
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:29,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon doesn't really count because it's two games.

762
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:32,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's true.

763
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,330
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit of cheating, isn't it?

764
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

765
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:35,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheaters.

766
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:36,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Poke-cheaters.

767
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:37,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheater-mons.

768
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:38,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheater-mons.

769
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:39,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheater.

770
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:40,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheater.

771
00:42:41,334 --> 00:42:43,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so yeah, Nintendo's making a lot of money in Japan.

772
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:44,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Go, Fig.

773
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:46,776
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is new?

774
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:48,377
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

775
00:42:48,397 --> 00:42:49,417
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell me what else is new.

776
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:53,299
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to do with old stuff for something new.

777
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:10,930
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a fact sheet released for details on Mario Kart Wii, and for anyone who's wanting to play with their classic controller or the GameCube controller, it has been said that certain moves will not be able to be used with those controllers.

778
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:12,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Like snaking?

779
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:13,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I say hooray.

780
00:43:13,932 --> 00:43:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say specifically.

781
00:43:16,034 --> 00:43:17,555
[SPEAKER_06]: They took snaking out of the game altogether.

782
00:43:17,575 --> 00:43:18,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we talked about that last week.

783
00:43:19,236 --> 00:43:19,556
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

784
00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:32,726
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's basically saying that by using the Wiimote and Nunchuck together you're supposed to have full playability in the game but those people are going to have an advantage over the people using the older controller schemes.

785
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:37,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling that it's not so bad as people are making it out to be.

786
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:38,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I think

787
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:46,361
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll probably be because I think you can do different little tricks and stuff, not just one trick when you're doing jumps to get boosts and stuff.

788
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:58,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So you probably will be able to do one trick on the GameCube or Classic Controller or something like that, and then the people at the Wii can use the controller to do different tricks using the motion controls.

789
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:03,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, I mean, with that controller turned sideways or something, I mean, there's definitely not...

790
00:44:04,261 --> 00:44:11,924
[SPEAKER_07]: That many buttons to use, and so a lot of it's motion control, so I don't see why they couldn't translate that stuff into button presses.

791
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:14,208
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sheer laziness.

792
00:44:14,308 --> 00:44:17,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think the game's going to control as well with a classic controller anyway?

793
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:23,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems to me like this game is going to be calibrated for that motion control that an analog stick can't quite replicate.

794
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:24,413
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

795
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:26,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think it'll be fine with the classic controller.

796
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Brawl with the classic controller, and I plan on playing this game.

797
00:44:29,495 --> 00:44:29,855
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's different.

798
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl doesn't rely on motion so much.

799
00:44:31,516 --> 00:44:41,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I mean, I plan on playing this game with the classic controller, and if that doesn't work, there's always the remote nunchuck, which you can just use the analog stick on that, and then...

800
00:44:41,761 --> 00:45:11,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the motion controls with the remote Because that's not gimped on it But I don't think it's going to be a big deal And the fact that they would do that to try to force people to buy their stupid You know, possibly use their stupid steering wheel controller or something like that I think it's kind of lame Besides, that steering wheel is going to give them problems We'll see I'm looking forward to the game nevertheless It's going to control a lot differently, that's for sure But as long as it's better than Double Dash

801
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:15,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is kind of neat.

802
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,322
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a homemade game for the Nintendo system.

803
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:22,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game called Glider.

804
00:45:22,605 --> 00:45:25,027
[SPEAKER_07]: It's made by a company called RetroZone.

805
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:28,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's a remake, I think, of a game that came out on the Mac or something like that.

806
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:34,093
[SPEAKER_07]: But the interesting thing about it is the game will have download content.

807
00:45:35,574 --> 00:45:37,176
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not as easy as it sounds.

808
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:40,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just like something you can pop into...

809
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:48,834
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually have to reflash the cart, and it requires a $70 accessory to do it.

810
00:45:48,894 --> 00:45:49,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, what a bargain.

811
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:56,236
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can get new levels and stuff, and that same accessory will let you dump ROMs and crap like that.

812
00:45:56,356 --> 00:46:05,878
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just still kind of neat to see them actually, first off, making new games, and secondly, allowing you to add new levels to it.

813
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:11,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't there still new games for the Nintendo being made in countries like Taiwan and stuff?

814
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:15,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Because didn't we see a version of one of the Tekken games?

815
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:17,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Like get an NES port or something recently?

816
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:18,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen some weird stuff.

817
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and those RPGs I've been seeing.

818
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:23,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Final Fantasy VII ported to the NES and that stuff.

819
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's also one that I saw, which is Contra III ported to the NES.

820
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:30,162
[SPEAKER_07]: That Titanic game?

821
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:31,943
[SPEAKER_07]: That looked like tons of fun.

822
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:33,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I don't know.

823
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:34,064
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

824
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:36,053
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting.

825
00:46:36,133 --> 00:46:38,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, they're still making like Vectrex games and stuff like that.

826
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:43,136
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always a fan of something somewhere.

827
00:46:44,377 --> 00:46:46,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you play a game based off Titanic on the NES?

828
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:46,998
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

829
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:50,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though Leonardo DiCaprio dies?

830
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,380
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

831
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:58,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you are interested in playing this game Glider, you can find it on the website RetroUSB.com

832
00:46:59,193 --> 00:47:01,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, I believe, like $50, no, $42.

833
00:47:02,115 --> 00:47:05,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, it's on back order, but coming out early April.

834
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:07,739
[SPEAKER_07]: The only bad thing about it is it's black and white.

835
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do think it came out originally on a Mac.

836
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:14,104
[SPEAKER_07]: The game, I guess, is from 1989.

837
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:21,589
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's cool, though, is it comes with a cardboard box, pretty manual, just like the old NES games.

838
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:25,111
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, there's the black dust sleeve and that kind of thing.

839
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:26,092
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's region-free.

840
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:26,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Airball

841
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:51,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Sudoku, yay.

842
00:47:51,429 --> 00:47:51,649
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

843
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:52,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I said Sudoku, yay.

844
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:52,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Sudoku?

845
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:52,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

846
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:52,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

847
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:53,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

848
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:53,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's...

849
00:48:13,854 --> 00:48:13,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Turok

850
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:43,977
[SPEAKER_06]: is coming out.

851
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:47,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

852
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:48,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you pre-order your copy?

853
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:52,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, yes, and then I named my kid after Turok.

854
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:52,721
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great.

855
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:55,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor kid.

856
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:56,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if he gets teased.

857
00:48:56,983 --> 00:48:58,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What grade would he be in now?

858
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:00,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Still in elementary school?

859
00:49:00,924 --> 00:49:01,164
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

860
00:49:01,324 --> 00:49:02,625
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid that was named Turok.

861
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:04,526
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't remember that contest?

862
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:07,607
[SPEAKER_03]: They got paid a million dollars to name their kid Turok?

863
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:11,228
[SPEAKER_03]: You host a video game show and you do not know this?

864
00:49:11,268 --> 00:49:13,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember old news.

865
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:14,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't that old.

866
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:17,070
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I don't know, 10 years old or something.

867
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:17,631
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

868
00:49:19,011 --> 00:49:27,695
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, we apologize that our audio is so fucked up in studio tonight, but something about that microphone that they're using in the back is really sensitive.

869
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:29,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

870
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:30,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll talk like right here.

871
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:31,396
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

872
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:32,237
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a perfect level.

873
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

874
00:49:33,157 --> 00:49:33,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio.

875
00:49:34,017 --> 00:49:34,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to Japan.

876
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:38,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

877
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:44,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart Wii makes its way out on April the 10th, as well as Karas Wii.

878
00:49:45,443 --> 00:49:47,724
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not Kid Akaris, that's K-A-R-O-U-S.

879
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:52,067
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Neo Geo Stick 2 comes out as well.

880
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:53,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that's a joystick.

881
00:49:53,167 --> 00:49:54,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's just a joystick.

882
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was actually a game for a minute.

883
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a stick figure game where you kind of think like Stick Fighter.

884
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,131
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Stick Fighter, exactly.

885
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:05,133
[SPEAKER_06]: The PlayStation 2 Battle of Sunrise comes out.

886
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: from Sunrise Interactive.

887
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wonder if it's like the employees fight each other.

888
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:10,351
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cool.

889
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:11,731
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be actually kind of a rad game.

890
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:15,293
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this looks like... What kind of game does this look like?

891
00:50:15,853 --> 00:50:20,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks kind of like one of those robot fighting games that you see quite a bit of in Japan.

892
00:50:20,915 --> 00:50:23,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like it's got a tech element to it as well.

893
00:50:23,856 --> 00:50:24,936
[SPEAKER_06]: That must be the gist of it.

894
00:50:24,976 --> 00:50:26,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably some type of tech game.

895
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:32,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS...

896
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:40,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Oshiri, Kajiri, Mushi, no, Rhythm Lesson DS comes out from Sega.

897
00:50:40,476 --> 00:50:45,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, did you say the first word was... Oshiri, Kajiri, Mushi.

898
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:49,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Oshiri, I'm probably just mispronouncing it because I horribly do that.

899
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,681
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a music game.

900
00:50:50,901 --> 00:50:57,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like learn how to dance like these scary looking critters with flowers coming out of their heads on the cover of the game.

901
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:00,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're saying like,

902
00:51:00,956 --> 00:51:03,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Move Your Butt, Rhythm Dancing, whatever it's called.

903
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:03,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

904
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:07,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you live in Japan and you've got no rhythm, hope is on the way.

905
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:16,019
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PSP, the only game coming out on the 10th, Nanpure and Okake Puzzle 10,000 Mon.

906
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:18,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

907
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just a Sudoku game.

908
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what they call it.

909
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, Sudoku.

910
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shut up.

911
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,400
[SPEAKER_03]: You shut up.

912
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,401
[SPEAKER_07]: How many Sudoku games do they have in the Simple series?

913
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:29,541
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just nuts.

914
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:33,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's silly because you can just play it for free online.

915
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:34,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why you'd buy a game.

916
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:39,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to remember that, though, that Oshiri means butt.

917
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, JustinTV, want me to show my Oshiri?

918
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,843
[SPEAKER_03]: No, please don't proposition that.

919
00:51:47,403 --> 00:51:50,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to see it.

920
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:52,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Glenn.

921
00:51:52,606 --> 00:51:53,446
[SPEAKER_03]: When did he get here?

922
00:51:53,526 --> 00:51:54,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knows who Glenn is.

923
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:55,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

924
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:57,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody knows that joke outside of well.

925
00:51:58,054 --> 00:51:58,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

926
00:51:58,675 --> 00:52:00,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of regret saying that.

927
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:08,237
[SPEAKER_01]: According to Alpha Canonogram, it's a butt-biting bug game.

928
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:10,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like fun.

929
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:14,038
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

930
00:52:15,138 --> 00:52:20,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And no, I'm not going to show my butt on the Justin TV cam because some sick asshole would highlight it.

931
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not going to do that.

932
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:23,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

933
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:26,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with other release dates, please.

934
00:52:27,768 --> 00:52:28,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

935
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:30,450
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some for the UK?

936
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:31,331
[SPEAKER_06]: How about it?

937
00:52:32,392 --> 00:52:33,513
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of stuff on the 11th.

939
00:52:51,448 --> 00:53:19,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam and Max Episode 205, What's New, Beelzebub I think that's a funny name, although I still won't play the game UEFA Euro 2008, Victorious Boxers Challenge So you can punch people in the face Sounds like fun That does sound like fun I want to punch people in the face Well, Drew's right there Hi, come here so I can punch you Is that it?

940
00:53:20,427 --> 00:53:20,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes

941
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:22,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, crap!

942
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:22,748
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite.

943
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:23,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

944
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:23,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

945
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:52,986
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is wrong with us?

946
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, make some games that aren't stupid.

947
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:56,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, they should make a game called Furries.

948
00:53:57,308 --> 00:53:58,189
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they shouldn't.

949
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:00,750
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you would at least rent it, just to see what it's about.

950
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:01,971
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I would not waste my money.

951
00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:03,492
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Second Life.

952
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:05,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It totally is.

953
00:54:05,853 --> 00:54:12,476
[SPEAKER_07]: The orange box is going to be broken up this week, so we have Half-Life 2, the episode pack, which I believe is episode 1 and 2.

954
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:17,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we've also got Portal coming out on PC.

955
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,721
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, of course, Team Fortress 2.

956
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:25,650
[SPEAKER_07]: and on the Wii, Minicopter Adventure Flight.

957
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,314
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a game where you can play around with a RC helicopter.

958
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,418
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also Summer Sports Paradise Island.

959
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:38,003
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Wii game with lawn darts, which are illegal, I guess, in the United States.

960
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:41,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Lawn Darts are illegal here?

961
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:43,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, we had those growing up.

962
00:54:43,919 --> 00:54:44,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're illegal now.

963
00:54:44,879 --> 00:54:47,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I'm reporting you to Hot Dog.

964
00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:51,163
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know Hot Dog.

965
00:54:51,443 --> 00:54:52,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

966
00:54:52,243 --> 00:54:55,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the Wii and PlayStation 2, Baroque is coming out this week.

967
00:54:57,166 --> 00:55:02,129
[SPEAKER_07]: On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart, which is that all-girl anime fighting game from Atlus.

968
00:55:02,629 --> 00:55:03,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Hot.

969
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:06,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Fatal Fury Battle Archives Vol. 2.

970
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out on PlayStation 2 for $14.99.

971
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:30,964
[SPEAKER_07]: On PC, we have Overclocked, A History of Violence, Assassin's Creed, and finally, oh, let's see here, Sam & Max Episode 205, What's New Beelzebub, will be coming out on GameTap and PC.

972
00:55:31,805 --> 00:55:33,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess Civil War Mysteries as well.

973
00:55:36,314 --> 00:55:36,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey!

974
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:37,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

975
00:55:37,895 --> 00:55:39,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We make fun on this show.

976
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's it.

977
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:45,860
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's, as we mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, Ikaruga's rumor will be coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade.

978
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that's not broken.

979
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:51,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully it isn't a shitty port, because that'll make me cry.

980
00:55:51,964 --> 00:55:53,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is my radiant silver gun?

981
00:55:54,946 --> 00:55:57,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, questions, or comments from chatroom.

982
00:55:57,267 --> 00:56:00,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Qualtipo says, the furry game would be rated D for drama.

983
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I guess there's a lot of drama in the furry scene.

984
00:56:02,691 --> 00:56:03,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I would know.

985
00:56:03,872 --> 00:56:04,592
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kidding.

986
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:05,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

987
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:11,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Catamaris Forever, Arcana Heart, Eleven Girl Fighters, Girl on Girl Action ManBearPig, CosplayersHateFurries

988
00:56:35,538 --> 00:56:42,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know there was this rivalry between cosplayers and furries.

989
00:56:42,104 --> 00:56:42,905
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Pirates and Ninjas.

990
00:56:42,945 --> 00:56:44,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that should be a fighting game.

991
00:56:45,187 --> 00:56:47,369
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess one kind of drama hates the other kind of drama.

992
00:56:47,629 --> 00:56:49,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Cosplayers versus furries.

993
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:50,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I would buy that.

994
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:52,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Pirates versus Ninja.

995
00:56:53,174 --> 00:56:53,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

996
00:56:54,836 --> 00:56:55,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah?

997
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:55,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Cowboys.

998
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:56,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Cowboys.

999
00:56:57,731 --> 00:57:01,412
[SPEAKER_06]: and SSGL100 Matt says, no, no, no, everyone hates furries.

1000
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:02,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, poor furries.

1001
00:57:03,793 --> 00:57:05,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Not poor furries.

1002
00:57:05,413 --> 00:57:07,434
[SPEAKER_03]: They're completely cognizant of what they're doing.

1003
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:12,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, I would love... Okay, so what are the ideas for games we've had?

1004
00:57:12,535 --> 00:57:13,495
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had laser cats.

1005
00:57:14,215 --> 00:57:16,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had... What else do we have on a previous show?

1006
00:57:16,956 --> 00:57:18,136
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to write these things down.

1007
00:57:18,216 --> 00:57:18,557
[SPEAKER_06]: You do.

1008
00:57:18,577 --> 00:57:19,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Or put them on the wiki or something.

1009
00:57:20,017 --> 00:57:20,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Something.

1010
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:20,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn it.

1011
00:57:21,057 --> 00:57:23,898
[SPEAKER_07]: But now we have... Wasn't there something that had to do with paper?

1012
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,403
[SPEAKER_06]: It was one of those games, yeah, because there was a game for DS coming out that you could just play on paper.

1013
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:33,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like Pictionary or something on the DS.

1014
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:34,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember talking about that in a previous show.

1015
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:36,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It was something you could play with a pen and paper.

1016
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:39,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I want to add this to the list.

1017
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:40,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Cosplayers vs. Furries.

1018
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:42,993
[SPEAKER_06]: An epic fighting battle.

1019
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:45,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's voice, the game.

1020
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:46,756
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, scratch that from the list.

1021
00:57:46,776 --> 00:57:47,336
[SPEAKER_06]: That wouldn't sell.

1022
00:57:52,899 --> 00:57:54,420
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL, that was the name of the game.

1023
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,522
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a game on the DS called LOL, and it was something you could just play with a fucking piece of paper and a pen.

1024
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:05,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right, because the whole premise of that game was to get people to laugh or something like that, and they would vote on which drawing is the funniest or something like that.

1025
00:58:05,246 --> 00:58:06,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's it, that's it.

1026
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's called pen and paper.

1027
00:58:08,828 --> 00:58:10,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Can somebody please add that to the wiki?

1028
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:17,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Can our wiki gods like AJ Mix or DarkTetsui or somebody, can our wiki gods add a page of our great ideas?

1029
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:20,654
[SPEAKER_06]: And be sure to put on the bottom, patent pending.

1030
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,672
[SPEAKER_07]: GameStop.com is down GameStop.com is down GameStop.com is down

1031
00:58:49,614 --> 00:58:49,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

1032
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:49,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1033
00:59:06,689 --> 00:59:10,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that's it for the US releases... I think it is at least.

1034
00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:13,473
[SPEAKER_06]: How did release dates turn into cosplayers versus furries?

1035
00:59:13,573 --> 00:59:14,093
[SPEAKER_03]: You did it.

1036
00:59:14,273 --> 00:59:15,174
[SPEAKER_06]: That was your fault, Rob.

1037
00:59:15,234 --> 00:59:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all my fault.

1038
00:59:16,254 --> 00:59:16,775
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it.

1039
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:18,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an April Fool's joke.

1040
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's actually not the first anymore.

1041
00:59:23,238 --> 00:59:28,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm trying to transition into talking about some of the April Fool's Day pranks from around the web.

1042
00:59:28,381 --> 00:59:29,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know I've got to start with this.

1043
00:59:29,702 --> 00:59:34,024
[SPEAKER_06]: This week we had so many April Fool's Day pranks because everyone gets in on it, except for Orange Lounge Radio this year.

1044
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:36,846
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't do an April Fool's Day prank because we had depressing news.

1045
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:39,167
[SPEAKER_06]: So the holiday was kind of ruined for us.

1046
00:59:39,588 --> 00:59:43,270
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the IGN trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie.

1047
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:44,943
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?

1048
00:59:45,363 --> 00:59:48,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody spent like thousands of dollars on that.

1049
00:59:48,327 --> 00:59:49,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see that trailer?

1050
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:50,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I did see that trailer.

1051
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:52,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't it make you like want to like come?

1052
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:54,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.

1053
00:59:54,213 --> 00:59:55,814
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually pretty well done.

1054
00:59:55,974 --> 00:59:56,935
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

1055
00:59:57,016 --> 01:00:00,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it was hokey, but it looked like a sci-fi movie to me.

1056
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:02,362
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you expect?

1057
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:03,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not much on the trailer.

1058
01:00:03,923 --> 01:00:07,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if they put a decent budget behind it and maybe had a good writer or something.

1059
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:12,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't believe for a minute it was real because it didn't have a single star in it.

1060
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:16,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And a movie like Zelda would at least have a star in it somewhere.

1061
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:21,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Ian McKellen playing the old man that says, it's tough out there to go alone.

1062
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:22,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Here, take this or something.

1063
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:23,500
[SPEAKER_06]: But he'd say it in his voice.

1064
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,801
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dangerous to go alone.

1065
01:00:24,841 --> 01:00:25,141
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1066
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

1067
01:00:26,562 --> 01:00:27,383
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dangerous.

1068
01:00:27,563 --> 01:00:29,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean Connery, it's dangerous to go along.

1069
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:30,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do impressions.

1070
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:31,608
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't, so you should stop.

1071
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,610
[SPEAKER_06]: But there would be at least one famous person.

1072
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:36,192
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why this thing couldn't be real and the CGI was a little hokey.

1073
01:00:36,473 --> 01:00:38,355
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it was pretty amazing.

1074
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:39,992
[SPEAKER_06]: The work that they did do.

1075
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,053
[SPEAKER_06]: For an April Fool's joke, it was awesome.

1076
01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:46,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they put a lot of effort into it for an April Fool's joke, but I wouldn't.

1077
01:00:46,415 --> 01:00:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, did you see the Making Of trailer?

1078
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:51,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they did that shit in July of last year.

1079
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:54,780
[SPEAKER_03]: They did a Making Of trailer of a trailer.

1080
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:02,485
[SPEAKER_06]: No, well, they had like a Making Of little snippet thing that was released the day after that shows you like how they did it.

1081
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,253
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I didn't check.

1082
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, it's April 2nd.

1083
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:09,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to check and see if there's something following up.

1084
01:01:09,497 --> 01:01:10,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this better?

1085
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:10,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1086
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:12,379
[SPEAKER_06]: The date was July.

1087
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:13,420
[SPEAKER_06]: They did that in July.

1088
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only thing I cared about in there was, like, when did they do it?

1089
01:01:15,722 --> 01:01:17,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I wanted to hear them say, like, why they did it.

1090
01:01:18,984 --> 01:01:21,146
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was July when they were putting it all together.

1091
01:01:21,166 --> 01:01:22,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just kind of surprised at that.

1092
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:24,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good job.

1093
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:28,231
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki, I noticed there was no Tingle in the movie, so there's still hope.

1094
01:01:29,692 --> 01:01:33,275
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't think that there was Tingle in the first game either.

1095
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:34,155
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1096
01:01:34,175 --> 01:01:34,836
[SPEAKER_06]: They can work it in.

1097
01:01:35,036 --> 01:01:35,636
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they can't.

1098
01:01:36,037 --> 01:01:37,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they can, but I'm not playing him.

1099
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the legend of me.

1100
01:01:44,366 --> 01:02:13,555
[SPEAKER_06]: The Legend of Me The Legend of Me Other April Fool's jokes from around the web Microsoft actually put together their own little thing like they were announcing all these devices that were going to come out such as the retro Xbox 360 that had a wood finish on it and the retro controller and I thought the hilarious part I like how Microsoft can kind of make fun of themselves because the retro controller had like 100 buttons on it it looked like a typewriter it was kind of funny and then they announced like a virtual headset and my favorite was Xbox Live the board game

1101
01:02:14,366 --> 01:02:15,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty good.

1102
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

1103
01:02:16,426 --> 01:02:17,107
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did we have?

1104
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:31,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Kotaku did Cake Kaku for a day or something like that, not Bukkake, but Cake Kaku or something like that for a whole day where they were nothing but gaming cakes, which was actually kind of funny because they do cover a lot of gaming cakes on that blog, or at least they did in the past year.

1105
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:34,090
[SPEAKER_06]: What else was there?

1106
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody announced My Little Pony for Xbox Live Arcade.

1107
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:39,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1108
01:02:40,692 --> 01:02:41,312
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1109
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:42,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't forget WoW.

1110
01:02:43,595 --> 01:02:44,456
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft 2 Torrin Marines

1111
01:03:12,937 --> 01:03:13,677
[SPEAKER_05]: They were beefy.

1112
01:03:14,177 --> 01:03:16,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like the Guild Wars thing.

1113
01:03:16,498 --> 01:03:17,638
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was cool.

1114
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:21,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lord of the Rings on mine had giant chickens that you had to fight.

1115
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:22,940
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody cares because it's Lord of the Rings on mine.

1116
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, speaking of Guild Wars, the Guild Wars wiki and the WoW wiki switched places for a day.

1117
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:31,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So you tried to go to WoW wiki and it was giving you Guild War quests.

1118
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:32,282
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

1119
01:03:32,302 --> 01:03:32,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1120
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:33,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And then vice versa.

1121
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:35,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Brilliant.

1122
01:03:35,343 --> 01:03:40,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was also the Konami Ubisoft one where they had Altair in Metal Gear Solid 4.

1123
01:03:41,977 --> 01:04:11,129
[SPEAKER_07]: and they did like an actual video from in-game and stuff with all that going on and what other ones oh Dark Tetsuya says Shang Long in Street Fighter 4 yeah just gonna say that that was funny I don't know there's oh Bungie did one where they're showing like the Xbox Halo 3 stats you know how like show a little light or whatever where people are playing Halo 3 and apparently it made you know their little cartoon Halo head thing on there

1124
01:04:11,502 --> 01:04:14,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Creativity from around the web Did anyone fall for a prank?

1125
01:04:14,944 --> 01:04:16,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Chatters, did any of you fall for a prank?

1126
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:41,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my boss to fall for a prank.

1127
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:42,757
[SPEAKER_06]: My work review was on April 1st.

1128
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was thinking that there was going to be all this stuff.

1129
01:04:54,036 --> 01:05:00,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went in and I was like, well, before we start the meeting, I have to tell you something really, really important.

1130
01:05:01,299 --> 01:05:02,560
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is bad news for you.

1131
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,020
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good news for me.

1132
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:10,923
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been offered a job at the Beau Ravage in Biloxi, Mississippi as their massage therapist for some sort of reopening thing.

1133
01:05:11,364 --> 01:05:12,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be moving in three weeks.

1134
01:05:13,565 --> 01:05:15,265
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did it completely deadpan.

1135
01:05:15,405 --> 01:05:18,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And she just got quiet and looked at me and said, I'm happy for you.

1136
01:05:19,733 --> 01:05:20,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, thank you.

1137
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:22,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I just completely fooled you.

1138
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,758
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at my annual review.

1139
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:26,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

1140
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:32,563
[SPEAKER_01]: But she said that they all got her by... She calls in to check on us every morning and that they said that nobody else showed up.

1141
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:39,649
[SPEAKER_06]: The only April Fool's prank I played is I went to our guild forum for WoW.

1142
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:45,954
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the guild forum and I posted a post that says why I quit the guild last night to go back to Final Fantasy XI.

1143
01:05:47,255 --> 01:05:49,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you open it up and it says, yeah, right, April Fool's.

1144
01:05:50,185 --> 01:05:51,165
[SPEAKER_03]: That's clever, Rob.

1145
01:05:51,225 --> 01:05:52,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it was great.

1146
01:05:52,946 --> 01:05:55,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The worst part is, some of us actually believe you.

1147
01:05:55,687 --> 01:05:56,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

1148
01:05:56,408 --> 01:05:58,709
[SPEAKER_01]: What about all the Rickrolling stuff that was going on?

1149
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:01,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, Rickrolling is so old.

1150
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:07,452
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there was a clever one that was linked to me of the Muppets.

1151
01:06:08,413 --> 01:06:09,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that one.

1152
01:06:09,473 --> 01:06:10,293
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was cool.

1153
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:18,457
[SPEAKER_05]: The best Rickroll was not Beaker, but it was not GameFAQs, which was evil.

1154
01:06:19,648 --> 01:06:27,295
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was actually Chris Perillo of Locker Gnome from the Screensavers announcing his last video podcast.

1155
01:06:28,476 --> 01:06:31,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Because apparently he had a fight with his woman.

1156
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:32,259
[SPEAKER_05]: His woman.

1157
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always the woman.

1158
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I just... He looks away, freeze frame, never gonna give you up, starts playing.

1159
01:06:39,525 --> 01:06:40,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, oh god.

1160
01:06:40,787 --> 01:06:45,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my favorite April Fool's joke other than the Zelda thing had to have been...

1161
01:06:46,107 --> 01:06:51,029
[SPEAKER_07]: and I know it was a little late for April Fools but the release of Mr. Driller and they're online.

1162
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so funny because it doesn't work.

1163
01:06:54,771 --> 01:06:59,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I fooled all those people because it's Mr. Driller online and the online portion doesn't work.

1164
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,815
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember Mo who was here a few weeks ago who did a cover of Still Alive?

1165
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:05,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that?

1166
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: She actually has a cover of Never Gonna Give You Up on YouTube and that's how we found her actually.

1167
01:07:11,398 --> 01:07:14,900
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how Jake found her to begin with and they call it chick-rolling.

1168
01:07:16,474 --> 01:07:17,595
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to link that YouTube.

1169
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:18,735
[SPEAKER_06]: So there it is.

1170
01:07:19,776 --> 01:07:20,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not making that up.

1171
01:07:20,556 --> 01:07:23,218
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a cover of her doing Never Gonna Give You Up.

1172
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:23,758
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite good.

1173
01:07:24,238 --> 01:07:27,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So April Fool's, I guess it's about fooling people, obviously.

1174
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:33,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the Zelda thing was pretty good, but I kind of like things that make me laugh on April Fool's Day.

1175
01:07:34,064 --> 01:07:38,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely the Molten Core console thing just made me crack up.

1176
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard does good jobs every year with April Fools.

1177
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:42,721
[SPEAKER_06]: They do good jobs.

1178
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:45,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with news because we want to wrap this segment up.

1179
01:07:45,242 --> 01:07:48,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have our downloadable content stuff.

1180
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:49,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, stuff.

01:07:59,487 --> 01:08:01,288
[SPEAKER_01]: This is UK, sorry.

01:08:01,928 --> 01:08:02,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1186
01:08:02,408 --> 01:08:03,169
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's over here.

1187
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:13,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Game Content, Call of Duty 4, Variety Map Pack, Two Worlds, Curse of Souls, Pinball FX, Rocky and Bullwinkle Table Guess what?

1188
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:14,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I owned one!

1189
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:14,943
[SPEAKER_01]: For reals!

1190
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:15,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So ha ha.

1191
01:08:17,284 --> 01:08:18,725
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got my World Cup Soccer.

1192
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:25,330
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol stuff.

1193
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:26,391
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?

1194
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:28,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get that game.

1195
01:08:28,473 --> 01:08:28,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1196
01:08:30,373 --> 01:08:58,239
[SPEAKER_01]: themes, MrDrillerOnline, FIFA Street 3, Brazil, England, France, Italy, Germany, Mexico, Spain, USA, Australia, pictures, Major League Gaming, GotFrag, Major League Gaming, Game Battles, Turok Creatures, Turok Whiskey Company, Wolf Pack, Variety, MrDrillerOnline, War Shit, Call of Duty 4, Nick Busby, Ink Blots, Number 2, Rainbow Six Vegas 2, Elite Pack, PSN, nothing.

1197
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtual Console in Europe, Yoshi's Cookie.

1198
01:09:02,297 --> 01:09:07,039
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U.S., we got Cruisin', and we got Wonder Boy, which we've talked about.

1199
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:21,907
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Metabolite thing, there's Imprinium Romanum, Buku Dominoes, and Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Sins of the Solar Empire as a PC demo is out.

1200
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:22,787
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.

1201
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:30,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the hilarious thing about the Mr. Driller Online theme, is that when you download it on Xbox 360, what the theme is, is just a bunch of red X's.

1202
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:37,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on.

1203
01:09:40,505 --> 01:09:41,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, I was going to say also...

1204
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:49,085
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation Network is not going to have much for the next few weeks anyway since they're revamping their store and in the meantime not putting anything up there.

1205
01:09:49,405 --> 01:09:55,228
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want your free still live like you get in Xbox 360 you're going to have to wait until the 17th.

1206
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:55,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So that sucks.

1207
01:09:56,649 --> 01:10:07,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Another game though that you're going to have to wait even longer for is The Force Unleashed which was originally going to be a July game but now it's been pushed all the way to September 16th where it's hopefully going to stay.

1208
01:10:08,094 --> 01:10:10,775
[SPEAKER_07]: This week though they had some videos showing off

1209
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:17,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The different versions of the game, which I guess each game is getting their own exclusive things.

1210
01:10:17,917 --> 01:10:25,983
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, the PlayStation 2 and PSP titles will be getting some exclusive storylines and stuff like that in the game.

1211
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:32,609
[SPEAKER_07]: In the 360 and PS3 versions, you of course get kick-ass graphics and physics.

1212
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:38,654
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Wii version, they actually have a battle mode where you can fight different people

1213
01:10:39,577 --> 01:10:44,218
[SPEAKER_07]: and also like, you know, Wiimote, Lightsaber Combat and stuff like that.

1214
01:10:44,718 --> 01:10:54,060
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe also the PSP version has some like legacy storyline modes that you can play through five different storylines through the six episodes of the movie.

1215
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:55,381
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of neat.

1216
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:58,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And it looks like a pretty awesome game.

1217
01:10:58,601 --> 01:11:02,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, September 16th is when we can see that in the U.S.

1218
01:11:06,323 --> 01:11:06,683
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1219
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you excited about The Force Unleashed?

1220
01:11:11,362 --> 01:11:11,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually am.

1221
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:13,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking about picking that up for the 360.

1222
01:11:13,345 --> 01:11:15,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars games are usually pretty good.

1223
01:11:16,969 --> 01:11:18,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Lego Star Wars.

1224
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:18,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So go figure.

1225
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:22,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We have people trying to connect to Live 365 right now and it's not letting them in.

1226
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:23,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are bastards.

1227
01:11:23,557 --> 01:11:25,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to miss this place at all.

1228
01:11:25,158 --> 01:11:27,161
[SPEAKER_06]: The more I think about it, we should have done this a year ago.

1229
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:27,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1230
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:28,571
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1231
01:11:29,592 --> 01:11:30,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Rooster Teeth.

1232
01:11:30,793 --> 01:11:38,637
[SPEAKER_06]: You might not know that name, but you definitely know Red vs. Blue, something that they've put together for years and years, but they obviously... They also did The Stranger Hood.

1233
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:39,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1234
01:11:39,057 --> 01:11:41,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now they're going to do something called Reconstruction.

1235
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:47,843
[SPEAKER_06]: They put out a trailer, a little teaser video that's available on YouTube if you search for Reconstruction, Rooster Teeth.

1236
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:52,806
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find it... What I find interesting about it, though, it's a little bit more serious.

1237
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:54,967
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the trailer had a more serious tone, so...

1238
01:11:55,407 --> 01:11:58,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they're getting away from the funny stuff and maybe doing something a little more serious.

1239
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,771
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that.

1240
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:02,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, every series that they've done has been funny.

1241
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:03,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that's true.

1242
01:12:03,674 --> 01:12:07,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe, I don't know, but it would be interesting if they took the different direction.

1243
01:12:07,937 --> 01:12:08,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting.

1244
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:13,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it'll be a dramedy, like Ally McBeal was drama but funny, well, to some.

1245
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's debatable.

1246
01:12:16,284 --> 01:12:17,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I never really found it funny.

1247
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:20,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither did anybody else.

1248
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:22,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I never watched it.

1249
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, snap.

1250
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:25,460
[SPEAKER_01]: She was too skeleton-like.

1251
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:27,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's every time I look at it.

1252
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,121
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1253
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:29,502
[SPEAKER_06]: No more TV critic.

1254
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:30,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to gaming news.

1255
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:34,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when we were talking about the contest for Puzzle Quest, the add-on getting a name?

1256
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:35,104
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1257
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:36,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

1258
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:36,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.

1259
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:37,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

1260
01:12:38,086 --> 01:12:38,306
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1261
01:12:41,928 --> 01:12:43,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the name of the new expansion?

1262
01:12:43,448 --> 01:12:44,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the name.

1263
01:12:44,269 --> 01:12:44,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to spell it.

1264
01:12:46,192 --> 01:12:49,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they got 500 plus suggestions.

1265
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:51,255
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it?

1266
01:12:51,295 --> 01:12:52,455
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually kind of sad.

1267
01:12:52,536 --> 01:12:52,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Only 500?

1268
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:53,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, right?

1269
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:57,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end they got Revenge of the Plague Lord.

1270
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:01,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping they would pick Puzzle Quest 1.5 to search for more money.

1271
01:13:03,801 --> 01:13:04,581
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Spaceballs 2.

1272
01:13:05,742 --> 01:13:06,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, yes.

1273
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually kind of a dumb title.

1274
01:13:09,444 --> 01:13:09,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1275
01:13:10,424 --> 01:13:12,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make me go OMG 1.

1276
01:13:12,645 --> 01:13:13,586
[SPEAKER_01]: The Runner's Up.

1277
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:18,007
[SPEAKER_01]: with Sorceress of Malbec and the Scourge of Antharg.

1278
01:13:19,288 --> 01:13:20,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are much cooler names.

1279
01:13:20,548 --> 01:13:23,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I knew an ogre in a D&D game named Antharg.

1280
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:28,391
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like they threw the alphabet into Will It Blend and they got those names.

1281
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:30,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Say that again.

1282
01:13:31,052 --> 01:13:32,653
[SPEAKER_06]: The Sorceress of Elbec?

1283
01:13:32,673 --> 01:13:33,013
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?

1284
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:33,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Malbec.

1285
01:13:33,593 --> 01:13:35,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Malbec and the Scourge of Antharg.

1286
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:36,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Antharg.

1287
01:13:37,114 --> 01:13:38,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you actually watch any of those yet?

1288
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:39,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Will It Blend is pretty good.

1289
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:42,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I watched the one where they blended a Guitar Hero controller.

1290
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,161
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the one where they blended the iPhone.

1291
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:46,161
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty awesome.

1292
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:48,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked the one where they exposed a hobo in that.

1293
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:52,603
[SPEAKER_06]: April Fool's.

1294
01:13:52,703 --> 01:13:53,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

1295
01:13:58,065 --> 01:14:03,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's a game that is on Xbox Live Arcade that everybody loves.

1296
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:06,804
[SPEAKER_07]: and, well, they're going to be loving the sequel, too.

1297
01:14:07,224 --> 01:14:12,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2, and it is coming to Xbox Live Arcade.

1298
01:14:12,568 --> 01:14:15,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, at least that's where we would assume it's going.

1299
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:22,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And this comes to us from the Australian Classifications Board, the OFLC, which has just raided the game.

1300
01:14:22,474 --> 01:14:29,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, kind of like the MPA, not the MPA, but the ESRB here.

1301
01:14:30,831 --> 01:14:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1302
01:14:50,993 --> 01:14:52,654
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think they're going to change in this game, though?

1303
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:54,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like the Wii version.

1304
01:14:54,095 --> 01:14:55,156
[SPEAKER_06]: The Wii version was good.

1305
01:14:55,196 --> 01:14:57,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that would be a pretty kick-ass download game.

1306
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:01,701
[SPEAKER_06]: But, I mean, then again, it's the game that's on the Wii, so I don't think they could do the same thing.

1307
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:07,265
[SPEAKER_06]: But, like, I didn't know there was a lot else they could do to Geometry Wars, but that Wii game was pretty awesome.

1308
01:15:07,345 --> 01:15:09,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Add some new animes, maybe, or something like that.

1309
01:15:09,367 --> 01:15:10,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Different weapons.

1310
01:15:10,928 --> 01:15:11,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1311
01:15:11,668 --> 01:15:14,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll have, like, co-op or competitive mode or something.

1312
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a big change, because they didn't have that in the first one.

1313
01:15:19,134 --> 01:15:20,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see.

1314
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to play this song.

1315
01:15:27,341 --> 01:15:37,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Long-time listeners of our show recognize that song as Happy Wedding, which is going to introduce a new segment in the show this week called Nerds Got Married.

1316
01:15:39,105 --> 01:15:43,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever there's a wedding of note that we want to highlight on the show, we're going to say Nerds Got Married.

1317
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:48,688
[SPEAKER_06]: So this week in Nerds Got Married, a listener of Orange Lounge Radio actually got married.

1318
01:15:49,562 --> 01:15:51,003
[SPEAKER_06]: The Viva Pinata guy!

1319
01:15:51,103 --> 01:15:52,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Viva Pinata guy?

1320
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:53,504
[SPEAKER_06]: He's actually a listener of the program.

1321
01:15:53,544 --> 01:15:54,884
[SPEAKER_06]: He commented on our MySpace.

1322
01:15:56,205 --> 01:15:59,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he was mad because we were poking fun at the story, even though that's what we do here.

1323
01:15:59,646 --> 01:16:02,767
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Viva Pinata guy got married.

1324
01:16:05,388 --> 01:16:12,151
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember in Viva Pinata, he did the diamond sending thing and did a little note in the game.

1325
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:15,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had the wedding, and they did it on a cruise ship.

1326
01:16:17,132 --> 01:16:21,195
[SPEAKER_06]: and they actually had little Viva Pinata creatures on their wedding cake.

1327
01:16:22,075 --> 01:16:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to David and Jen.

1328
01:16:25,037 --> 01:16:35,203
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to see more about the wedding, it's all on David's YouTube channel, which is available at, what's his username?

1329
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Gearscast.

1330
01:16:37,044 --> 01:16:40,066
[SPEAKER_06]: It's G-E-A-R-S-C-A-S-T.

1331
01:16:40,546 --> 01:16:42,527
[SPEAKER_06]: He must also be a big Gears Award player.

1332
01:16:43,548 --> 01:16:44,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you have it.

1333
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:44,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerds got married.

1334
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:45,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

1335
01:16:47,816 --> 01:16:48,256
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1336
01:17:15,461 --> 01:17:19,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It also hurts my heart that this is classic now.

1337
01:17:20,922 --> 01:17:23,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, what did you pick for the kids this week?

1338
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:25,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your classic game of the week, something they must check out.

1339
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:27,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked pure awesomeness.

1340
01:17:28,204 --> 01:17:29,745
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked Crazy Taxi.

1341
01:17:29,765 --> 01:17:31,785
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 gas.

1342
01:17:33,386 --> 01:17:33,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1343
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:38,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is the best, like, one of the best games ever.

1344
01:17:39,508 --> 01:17:42,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, hey, it's time to make some crazy money.

1345
01:17:42,688 --> 01:17:43,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready?

1346
01:17:43,529 --> 01:17:44,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go!

1347
01:17:47,373 --> 01:17:48,954
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the same song I remember.

1348
01:17:49,134 --> 01:17:52,916
[SPEAKER_01]: No, well, it had Bad Religion and Off the Line.

1349
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:53,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.

1350
01:17:53,897 --> 01:18:08,144
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's basically, not only is it a clever type of beat-the-clock sort of driving game, you can do different kinds of stunts in there to increase your fare.

1351
01:18:08,164 --> 01:18:10,805
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to play for a better rating.

1352
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:14,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember playing in the arcade until I got an S-class license and I was so freaking happy.

1353
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:30,196
[SPEAKER_01]: But the game also is a clever advertising technique for Pizza Hut, Fila, Tower Records, which actually I guess it wasn't so clever for Tower Records, Levi's Store, and Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1354
01:18:30,816 --> 01:18:34,218
[SPEAKER_01]: They all had massive product placement in that game.

1355
01:18:34,718 --> 01:18:36,359
[SPEAKER_01]: But you had four different drivers.

1356
01:18:36,539 --> 01:18:45,463
[SPEAKER_01]: You had your balanced driver, you had your fast one, you've got your best control, and then you had your heavy cab that can

1357
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:46,306
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura

1358
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,882
[SPEAKER_00]: The songs from Bad Religion and Offspring from Bad Religion have been released at 10 and 2010, then the Master of the Gearing.

1359
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:12,323
[SPEAKER_00]: And Offspring knows all I want to enjoy the world and lay down the line.

1360
01:19:12,363 --> 01:19:12,903
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it was.

1361
01:19:12,943 --> 01:19:14,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1362
01:19:14,544 --> 01:19:15,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that song.

1363
01:19:15,204 --> 01:19:18,885
[SPEAKER_06]: That song, like, I can't hear that song on the radio and not think of this game.

1364
01:19:20,906 --> 01:19:22,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let me forward a little bit.

1365
01:19:24,207 --> 01:19:24,427
Thanks.

1366
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:27,508
Take me to Pizza Hut.

1367
01:19:27,528 --> 01:19:28,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Take me to Pizza Hut.

1368
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:31,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this game.

1369
01:19:32,024 --> 01:19:33,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think this is one of the better driving games.

1370
01:19:34,245 --> 01:19:37,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not so fond of it on the Dreamcast as I am in the arcades.

1371
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:40,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for me, that's the home for this game, was an arcade game.

1372
01:19:40,387 --> 01:19:44,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I will give props to the Dreamcast version, because it had the missions, and it had the extra stuff in it.

1373
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:46,150
[SPEAKER_06]: The missions were hard, though.

1374
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:49,211
[SPEAKER_01]: The missions were actually pretty cool, so I'm just going to bring that up.

1375
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:55,834
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually... It trains you to do different stuff in the game, is what the missions are there for.

1376
01:19:56,274 --> 01:19:58,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So showing you how to do, like, uh...

1377
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:08,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually thought the later ones that had some of the interesting ones like the super long jump and everything that was kind of cool.

1378
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:10,782
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my favorite games ever.

1379
01:20:12,347 --> 01:20:13,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Irene, were you a fan of Crazy Taxi?

1380
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I never played it.

1381
01:20:15,389 --> 01:20:15,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

1382
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:16,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.

1383
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,171
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really fun game, actually.

1384
01:20:18,251 --> 01:20:18,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I should try it.

1385
01:20:18,812 --> 01:20:21,013
[SPEAKER_06]: For a driving game, it's a lot, it's just different.

1386
01:20:21,053 --> 01:20:24,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just, you know, like NASCAR, vroom, vroom, vroom around in a circle.

1387
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:24,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fun.

1388
01:20:24,456 --> 01:20:26,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You race the clock and get crazy money.

1389
01:20:26,757 --> 01:20:27,778
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys get crazy money.

1390
01:20:27,798 --> 01:20:29,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Take people to Pizza Hut.

1391
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:30,680
[SPEAKER_03]: How could you not like that?

1392
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll have to try it sometime.

1393
01:20:32,181 --> 01:20:33,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually available on GameTap, too.

1394
01:20:33,982 --> 01:20:36,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I whore that a lot, but hey, they got free games on there.

1395
01:20:36,924 --> 01:20:37,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess free, free, but...

1396
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:47,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like on the later ones, how they had it where you could play, where you could have multiple people in your car, too, and do different deliveries to different places?

1397
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:52,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Rostio UT says, funny that Pizza Hut isn't Pizza Hut anymore, they're Pasta Hut now.

1398
01:20:52,627 --> 01:20:54,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they have to change that in later games or something, maybe?

1399
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:56,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, in the game?

1400
01:20:56,871 --> 01:20:57,331
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1401
01:20:57,531 --> 01:20:57,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1402
01:20:58,032 --> 01:20:59,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that an April Fool's joke?

1403
01:20:59,513 --> 01:20:59,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1404
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:01,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, perhaps.

1405
01:21:01,375 --> 01:21:03,056
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're Wing Street now, or whatever.

1406
01:21:07,075 --> 01:21:09,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw mentions in the game you can't run over people, sadly.

1407
01:21:10,076 --> 01:21:11,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Any attempt, they always run out of the way.

1408
01:21:11,877 --> 01:21:15,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about running into cars.

1409
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:17,800
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run into cars.

1410
01:21:19,721 --> 01:21:20,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Crazy Taxi.

1411
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:21,842
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, me too.

1412
01:21:21,862 --> 01:21:23,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make some crazy money, Rob.

1413
01:21:24,924 --> 01:21:25,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got a dollar.

1414
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:28,225
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe you a dollar.

1415
01:21:28,245 --> 01:21:29,106
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just keep it.

1416
01:21:30,862 --> 01:21:38,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A of our podcast, but there's plenty more to come for this, our last week on Live 365.

1417
01:21:38,066 --> 01:21:43,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming up in Part B, we're going to play a game that we started here on Live 365.

1418
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:47,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, this game dates all the way back to a show I did on college radio.

1419
01:21:47,832 --> 01:21:49,873
[SPEAKER_06]: So this game has survived for 10 years.

1420
01:21:50,293 --> 01:21:51,654
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play it one last time.

1421
01:21:51,694 --> 01:21:55,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not last time, but one more time tonight here on Live 365, and then we'll bring it over to all games in a few weeks.

1422
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:57,477
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play Listless tonight.

1423
01:21:58,303 --> 01:22:03,427
[SPEAKER_06]: and the topic for tonight's list list so folks can start thinking about what they want to do here in studio.

1424
01:22:04,227 --> 01:22:08,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that Live365 could do to get us to stay.

1425
01:22:09,751 --> 01:22:11,352
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the topic of tonight's list list.

1426
01:22:11,652 --> 01:22:14,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that Live365 could do to get us to stay.

1427
01:22:15,235 --> 01:22:20,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys think about that and we will cover that in part B of our podcast.

1428
01:22:20,138 --> 01:22:21,819
[SPEAKER_06]: But until then, a break.

1429
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:22,880
[SPEAKER_06]: See you then.

1430
01:22:23,624 --> 01:22:28,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice a week.

1431
01:22:29,076 --> 01:22:33,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
