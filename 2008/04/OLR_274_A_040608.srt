O'Brien, the author of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,320
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,160
and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,080
My name is Rob Roberts.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,120
Joining me, as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
Hi.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,120
How are you doing?

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Hi.

10
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Okay.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm doing okay.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Good.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,840
Say hello, as well, to Tech Master Loki.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Hello.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
How are you doing?

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm doing okay.

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
All right.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm glad to hear you're okay and not crappy.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm not crappy.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
All right.

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Good.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
We were going to have some guests tonight.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,320
Actually, I invited... Well, it was very last minute.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,880
I was out most of the week, as some of you have heard.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,320
I'll get into that later, but I invited guests from the past, because tonight is the last

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,640
show on Live 365.

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,040
I invited a bunch of guests from the past to come tonight to say goodbye to Live 365,

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
and no one's here.

29
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
I don't want to say goodbye.

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
You know what I want to say?

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,040
What?

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Fuck you.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, I sent the official cancellation notice today, so there's no turning back now.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
It's a done deal.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
They're bastards.

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Oh, I know.

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,640
They shouldn't have upped the rates, but oh well.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
It's done.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,800
If you don't know the latest yet, go back and listen to last week's show.

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,760
Again, starting next week, April the 13th, we are now going to be on allgames.com.

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,000
For those of you guys that listen to the podcast, which is most of you listen to this in podcast

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560
form only, not the live stream, you're really not going to have to change a damn thing,

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
because the podcast feed will stay the same.

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
The shows are going to go to the same place.

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Not a lot's going to change for you, except some aesthetic things.

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
We might try some different sound qualities and so on, but nothing that's really going

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
to shake things up too much.

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,400
But for the live folks, this is a big deal, because we have some folks that have been

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,220
here every freaking night practically for the past five and a half years.

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
That's a lot.

51
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,240
So it's a big change for some people, like Dark Tetsuya I know is here, episode one.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
He's still here tonight.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Drew is supposed to be in studio tonight.

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,560
I don't know why he's not here yet.

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,280
He might be just running late.

56
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,960
He was also here for episode one, so we have a lot of people that maybe weren't here for

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,040
episode one, but joined us somewhere along the way.

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,320
So it's a big change for our live listeners.

59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,240
Anyhow, let's go ahead and start off tonight's show, as we always do with How Was Your Gaming

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Week?

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,240
Dark Sakura, we'll start off with you.

62
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
How was your gaming week?

63
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:07,000
It was Ragnarokan, as usual, and we have started working on cleaning up the pinball machines,

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,880
because Dan's having a pinball party next Sunday.

65
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,440
That sounds like fun, a pinball party, huh?

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,640
We're having a bunch of people over at the house, it's like, everybody wants to meet

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
you.

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
It's like, well, too bad.

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,440
What exactly happens at a pinball party?

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Pizza and pinball.

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Oh, okay.

72
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
Sounds pretty good.

73
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,760
And then people talk about their collections and stuff, it's just like, look how pretty

74
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,120
my pinball tables are.

75
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,360
Are people actually going to bring pinball tables over?

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
No.

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Okay, I was going to say, they're not very portable.

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
No, but we have plenty, I think.

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Are you going to do...

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Well, here's my question.

81
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,960
Are you going to have not just the pinball machines, but maybe, like, pinball FX on the

82
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,800
TV, on Xbox Live?

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
I don't know.

84
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
You know what you can do on Xbox Live?

85
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Shit.

86
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
You can do shit.

87
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,480
I was going to suggest that he hook up the Nintendo and put in Pinbot.

88
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
Ah, there you go.

89
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,360
And maybe we can hook up the TurboGrafx and put in Devil's Crush.

90
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,760
Oh, okay, good idea.

91
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:10,080
And he picked up one of those classic collections, too, like the whatever super awesome of pinball.

92
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,000
And to Shadow Siler, I play on Essence RO, but you won't ever find me.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
I haven't made the guild yet.

94
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,760
How about Sonic Spinball?

95
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,480
I could do that.

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
I've got Sonic Spinball.

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Because that was a very strange pinball game.

98
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,560
It reminded me of that part of Casino Night where I'd get stuck and get pissed off.

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,240
So that's what that game always reminded me of.

100
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,360
Gotcha.

101
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,640
We always welcome our chatters.

102
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,380
They're here with us every week.

103
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,560
This last Live 365 show is no exception, and we'll still be in the same chat room next

104
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
week.

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,000
That's an important note.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,120
At this time, we're not going to be switching to the all-games chat.

108
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,160
I don't know if we will in the future.

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,960
We're doing baby steps right now, so we're still going to have the Orange Launch chat

110
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
next week.

111
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

112
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,120
Comment from Shadow Siler says, DarkSakura, which server do you Ragnarok on?

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
That's what I answered when you said that I play on the Essence server.

114
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
I was on crack.

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,560
Canty says, How many pinball machines does DarkSakura have?

117
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Okay.

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
Now, I have to think about which ones are actually mine, because we're holding some

119
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
for some people.

120
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,360
So the ones that we're holding is a Brite of Pinbot, an Indiana Jones that Dan is shopping

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,660
out.

122
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,640
We are holding a Back to the Future and a Black Knight, not Black Knight 2000.

123
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
I wish I had that one.

124
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,760
And then for ours, we have Star Trek The Next Generation.

125
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:43,720
We have No Fear, Twilight Zone, Simpsons Pinball Party, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,880
my machine, World Cup Soccer 94.

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,840
Did I say Twilight Zone?

128
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,160
Yeah, we have Twilight Zone.

129
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
All right.

130
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,680
It seems like things have changed a lot since the last time even I was over there.

131
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
That's crazy.

132
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
All right.

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,520
So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

134
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
As he sits down, ready to go.

135
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,120
My gaming week was pretty brief.

136
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,680
I played pretty much just Saints Row this entire week, I think, yes.

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,840
But it's finished now, so that's good.

138
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,720
And well, I'm still not 100% in the game because I have to do all the damn activities and some

139
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,520
of them are fucking impossible, but as far as the story goes, I'm done.

140
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,840
I already knew what the ending was anyway, so I'm glad I'm done so I can start Saints

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,160
Row 2 when that comes out in Grand Theft Auto IV and all that fun stuff.

142
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
That's it.

143
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Wow.

144
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
That's a relatively short week for you.

145
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,760
Well, I played a lot of Saints Row.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,360
I mean, we played the death matches during lunch.

147
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,080
I had a funny moment where I was driving on the sky in Saints Row because the game is

148
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,920
a little glitchy sometimes.

149
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,840
So that was fun.

150
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,280
And well, that's about it.

151
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,400
I didn't play a lot this week, but I did have enough time to beat a game.

152
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
That's right.

153
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,960
I beat a game from start to finish, which I haven't done in quite a long time.

154
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,360
And the game that I beat was You Have to Burn the Rope.

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,360
I don't know if you've seen this game yet, but it's got hilarious music.

156
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,760
It's stupid but funny, you know, one of those stupid funny things.

157
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,400
So obviously, don't take that too seriously.

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
The game takes like a minute and a half to beat.

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,400
And then, let's see, besides that, really not a lot.

160
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,600
I played Mr. Driller for like 10 minutes.

161
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,680
The new one on Xbox Live Arcade.

162
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,920
Well, yeah, I was a little bit disappointed.

164
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,120
I wonder what version they ported because I was surprised to see, and maybe it's just

165
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,680
because of the mechanics of the game or whatever, but I was surprised to see that the playing

166
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,320
field was only a really small portion of the screen.

167
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,080
I don't know if maybe that's to support the multiplayer or what have you.

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
Did you get to play online?

169
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,560
Which is probably a lot more fun.

170
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,840
No, I'm completely basing my judgment off the demo.

171
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,800
Oh, good, because if you played online, you'd be like, this game is shit.

172
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
Why?

173
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Did you play it online?

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Well, the online is all broken.

175
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
It's completely broken.

176
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,240
If you're hosting the game, you have no problem, but other people that are playing with you,

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
they can't drill down.

178
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,480
They'll start drilling down and they'll pop back up, and they'll start drilling down and

179
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
they'll pop back up.

180
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Nice.

181
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,360
There's so much lag in it, it actually goes in reverse sometimes.

182
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,520
So yeah, I didn't play a lot of games this week, but I have a valid excuse, so I'll talk

183
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,920
about this real quick because a lot of people have been asking.

184
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,680
The reason why Part B went up on Saturday this week, which is extremely late for Part

185
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
B to go up.

186
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,400
We tried to get it up on Wednesday, like Thursday at the absolute latest if I had something

187
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
going on.

188
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,840
I was in the hospital for three days this week, and it was mentioned on orangeontraday.com,

189
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,760
you probably saw that, and obviously I'm here, so I'm fine.

190
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,480
I don't know how much I've mentioned it on the live show, but I've been having abdominal

191
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
pains on and off for the past three weeks, and finally it kind of reached a head on Wednesday.

192
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,400
I got woken up by some horrendous chest pain, and it was like, like, alien is going to pop

193
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,480
out of my chest, you know, bad.

194
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,320
So I finally just went to the ER.

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,400
I was kind of getting the runaround from my doctors, you know, like, they had diagnosed

196
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,160
me with pancreatitis, but didn't seem to be doing much about it, and finally I had to

197
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
go to the hospital.

198
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,640
So, yeah, that's where I spent about three days, pretty much, because what I had was

199
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,660
acute pancreatitis, basically my pancreas is fucked up, and it was producing too much

200
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,080
of a certain chemical, and it makes it really painful to eat fatty foods.

201
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,480
It most commonly happens, funny enough, it most commonly happens in lushes.

202
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,720
You know, people who drink a lot, alcoholics, like 80% of the cases are alcoholics.

203
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,400
Now, while I enjoy the occasional beverage, and I talk about it here on this program,

204
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,320
I would say drinking one, maybe two drinks a week does not make me an alcoholic, so alcohol

205
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,840
didn't cause it, and being fat didn't cause it.

206
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,240
I thought that maybe the fact that I ate out a lot and all that stuff might have caused

207
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,240
me to go to the hospital, but that wasn't it either.

208
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:05,240
My triglycerides were too low for that to be the case, so that was not the case either.

209
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,960
So they don't know what caused it, and now the thing is, is that I don't want to be into

210
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,200
too much of a downer syndrome or whatever, but folks have been asking.

211
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,880
The weird thing is, is that they did like a CAT scan, they did an MRI and all this shit

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,320
on me in the hospital.

213
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,680
I have some type of cyst on my pancreas, apparently, and thank God it's not cancer, says the doctor,

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,100
because then I would have what Patrick Swayze has, and that's really not good, and I'm not

215
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,400
trying to make light of that situation.

216
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,160
It's never good to be compared to Patrick Swayze.

217
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,520
Well, no, I'm serious, because he only has so long left to live.

218
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,000
It's the same thing Michael Landon of Highway to Heaven died of years ago, is pancreatic

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
cancer.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,160
Thank God it's not cancer, but still, it's kind of scary.

221
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,880
So I don't mean to bring the show down, but that's basically where I was all week, and

222
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,360
since folks have been asking, that's what's up.

223
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,160
I find the toughest part of all of it is, A, the fact that I didn't do anything to cause

224
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
it.

225
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,520
It's one of those cases where really they don't know what caused it.

226
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,160
They think it could be an allergy to the medication I took, although if that's the case, I will

227
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,320
be one of the first documented cases of that kind of allergy, like ever, to this antibiotic

228
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
I took.

229
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,560
They also say that stress is a cause.

230
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm not that stressed out, though.

231
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Things are pretty good in my life right now, all things considered.

232
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,600
Sure, the life 365 thing sucks, but it's not going to cause me to go into the hospital

233
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
bad.

234
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
You know what I mean?

235
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
So I don't know.

236
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I don't know.

237
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,280
It's really bad.

238
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,600
My only thing is I'm always afraid it's going to come back, but I've lost a crazy amount

239
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
of weight.

240
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,400
In the past month, I've lost 21 pounds, to put it, and you probably notice if you're

241
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,000
on just a TV because my pants won't stay on.

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's kind of sexy.

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No, I'm just kidding.

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right.

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,560
I'll stop being such a downer now.

246
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,320
That was my week and why I didn't have much of a gaming week.

247
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,640
I noticed that strolling in a little late to the program is Drew is finally here.

248
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Yes, that's on.

249
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,680
It's very sensitive, though, so be careful with it.

250
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,680
He'll pick you up from a long way away.

251
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Just leave it there then.

252
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Maybe you can.

253
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,440
Just kind of tilt it towards you and talk into it.

254
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Hey, guys.

255
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Are you listening clearly, I hope?

256
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah.

257
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
All right.

258
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Introduce yourself.

259
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
It's DrewNami, of course.

260
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
It's DrewNami.

261
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Of course.

262
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
And you were here episode one, weren't you?

263
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
I was not here episode one.

264
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
I was listening to episode one.

265
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,160
But you were listening to episode one, and now you're here for the last show on Life

266
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
is Five.

267
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
Well, not the last, last show.

268
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah.

269
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,840
I remember episode one, I was listening from New York.

270
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
So how was your gaming week?

271
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,240
We're going to get that mic a little closer to you while you talk about your gaming week.

272
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah.

273
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
You move a little closer.

274
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,360
I don't know what happened to Irene, so we'll wait for her later.

275
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Well, how was your gaming week?

276
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, I've been on my WoW methadone.

277
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,280
I've been on Guild Wars for a while, got the new expansion for it.

278
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,640
It's pretty good.

279
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,360
I got in with a guild from Game Facts, a small little guild.

280
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,120
It's not WoW, but it's good enough.

281
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,600
What's so exciting about the most recent Guild Wars expansion?

282
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,840
They give you a whole bunch of new NPC heroes to put in your party if you're antisocial

283
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
and shit.

284
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,120
And you get a whole bunch of new missions, new skills, basically new everything, and

285
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,960
it all leads into Guild Wars 2.

286
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,520
Yeah, they're still saying you're really quiet.

287
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,600
Go ahead and just pick up the mic.

288
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,520
Just hold it away from your mouth.

289
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Live radio, folks.

290
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Come on, come on.

291
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
It happens.

292
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
All right.

293
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Did you play on April 1st?

294
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah, did you play on April 1st, and everyone was a stick figure?

295
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,600
Yeah, I played on April 1st, and I think the reason why it wasn't picking me up was because

296
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
the mic was off.

297
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,640
Oh, how convenient.

298
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
That might have been the problem.

299
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
That's all right.

300
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,440
All right, but it's on now.

301
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
We're good.

302
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,840
So anything else you're giving me?

303
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,680
I've actually been participating in one of the X-Fire events for Grand Chase.

304
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
Apparently, there's still an open beta, and they want people to test it out, so they're

305
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,680
doing in-game contests and such.

306
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,240
It's pretty good.

307
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,600
It's kind of like Smash Brothers meets MapleStory, if you can even ponder that as possible.

308
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,240
Are you going to miss Live 365?

309
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,400
Yeah, I am going to miss Live 365, fourth and all.

310
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,720
What are you going to miss most about it?

311
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,520
Pretty much listening to 24-7 Station while playing WoW, but both of those are going to

312
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,800
be gone.

313
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,040
You're ditching WoW, too?

314
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
I stopped playing WoW back in October.

315
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,280
Oh, in favor of Guild Wars, or just...

316
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,040
In favor of having money.

317
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,320
Oh, and having a life.

318
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
I ran out of money.

319
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,200
Ah, I gotcha.

320
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,600
WoW is an expensive habit.

321
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,440
I'll probably join back up with a new expansion, but...

322
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,800
There are ways to play for free.

323
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,800
There are ways to play for free, but they all suck.

324
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Hacksource servers.

325
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,760
No, I can't imagine they're fun at all.

326
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,160
Not that, but yeah, there are ways to pay for free.

327
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,720
Oh, latest 2600.

328
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
What?

329
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,000
You could steal prepaid cards from the store.

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
On the 2600.

331
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, you...

332
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No.

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I hate April Fools.

334
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, no, no.

335
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
You can move in a total of eight directions.

336
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,760
No, I meant in the latest magazine of the 2600.

337
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Oh, 2600 magazine.

338
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Oh, that 2600.

339
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
No, not the Atari 2600.

340
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
No, no, no, no.

341
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Let's not even talk about 2600.

342
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
No.

343
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
No.

344
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,360
It's something that has to do with PayPal and crap, so whatever.

345
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Interesting.

346
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,400
But you have to do it every time you play it, so that's annoying.

347
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Alright.

348
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,680
I love, though, that you have the Horde symbol on your laptop.

349
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,720
That always makes me giddy.

350
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,640
I dug this up from some of my old stuff.

351
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,000
I never expected you to get a laptop.

352
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,480
I hope they can see that on Justin.TV, our little...

353
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
I'll skip.

354
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Alright, awesome.

355
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Alright.

356
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,120
Turn that mic off when we're not using it, because it makes a lot of clicky, clicky noises,

357
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
so...

358
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,400
I don't know.

359
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
What the hell?

360
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
That mic is on crack.

361
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,200
Alright, well, I think that's going to do it for everybody's gaming week, so let's talk

362
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
a little bit about housekeeping.

363
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,240
Really the only thing on deck is that there is the All Games move pending.

364
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,500
That's going to start on April the 13th.

365
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Love this, by the way.

366
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,880
AllGames.com is rolling out the red carpet for us.

367
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
We love them.

368
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
They're being great.

369
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,000
There's actually a little countdown clock on AllGames.com that says, like, it counts

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,360
down the days and hours and minutes until OLR comes exclusively to their station.

371
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,640
It's going to be great.

372
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,440
So look for us there.

373
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,400
The plug will be pulled on live 365 on the 12th, probably around 8 or 9 o'clock at night.

374
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,800
I'm hoping that we're here to do it live, or at least I'll be here to sign on live,

375
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,720
say some final, final farewells, and then officially pull the plug for Dead Air.

376
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,880
So the plug will ceremonially be pulled on Saturday night.

377
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
That'll be fun.

378
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Sorry, I...

379
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
What?

380
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
No.

381
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
It's almost like it's a person.

382
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Yes, it's almost like it's a person.

383
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
I know.

384
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Pulling the plug on.

385
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,280
We will be taking the horse out to the barn and shooting it on Saturday.

386
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,680
No, they will become glue.

387
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,400
I know we make fun of it here, and some of the, like, even some folks in chat were commenting

388
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,720
earlier like, boy, they sure sound like they're going to miss the 24-7 feed.

389
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
We are.

390
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,080
We're going to miss it.

391
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,280
But at the same time, you know what, it's kind of like one of the songs in the pre-show

392
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,880
tonight, which had a very tongue-in-cheek theme tonight if you were listening our little

393
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
pre-show music.

394
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,520
A change will do you good.

395
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,160
So this is going to be something new for us.

396
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
It's going to be fun.

397
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,240
So that's that.

398
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,800
Zappi says, will there be punch at the plug pulling?

399
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Punch and pat.

400
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,480
Punch and pat.

401
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,480
But not alcoholic punch because I don't want to go back to the hospital with more pancreatitis.

402
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,800
Please nod that.

403
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,840
So we're excited, though, about allgames.com.

404
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:33,600
I still don't have the final word for you on Travis and DMN and all that, but if I had

405
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,980
a Magic 8-Ball and I shook it, it would say Outlook looks good.

406
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,560
They're probably going to come over a little later than us, but we'll be there on Sunday

407
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
the 13th.

408
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Excited.

409
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,600
All right, enough housekeeping.

410
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,200
Let's get into gaming news that we can taunt to make fun of.

411
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Loki.

412
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,600
Okay, so this is pretty awesome.

413
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,280
It's been rumored to be happening, but finally official now.

414
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,640
Sam and Max are coming to the Wii, and of course it's being brought to us in the U.S.

415
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,980
by Dreamcatcher and of course the adventure company, and in Europe, Joe Wood of course

416
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,160
is publishing it there.

417
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
Not really any word on what exactly it will include.

418
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,640
Probably a lot of the episodes that we saw on the PC.

419
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,680
Don't know if maybe it's a compilation of season one, maybe something like season two.

420
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Who knows?

421
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,240
Maybe it's even like, no, it's not going to have download content on the Wii.

422
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,660
But I don't know, it's pretty awesome, though.

423
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:42,600
So glad to be able to play some Sam and Max since I don't use GameTap or want to buy software.

424
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,480
And so that's going to be going to WiiWare?

425
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,440
I think that's actually going to be going to the Wii.

426
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,240
Oh, so it's not WiiWare.

427
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,800
Because I remember there was a rumor a while back that it was going to go to WiiWare.

428
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,680
I guess they could do it that way, but I don't think they would.

429
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,960
I think it'd just be the first season or something like that.

430
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Yeah, that would be exciting.

431
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,840
I mean, if they package all the games together into one because the games themselves are

432
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,560
only three to four hours long, but if they package the entire first season, which was

433
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,840
like eight episodes, I want to say, I don't remember off the top of my head.

434
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,160
Maybe they could do the first and second season or something like that.

435
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,800
That would be a great deal because that would be, you know, you'd probably have like at

436
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,080
least 15 episodes all together in one place.

437
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,280
I think that would be a pretty good deal.

438
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,800
And yeah, for those people that don't really game on the PC or have GameTap or any of that,

439
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,200
I think it'll be pretty good.

440
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,360
So we will see what happens.

441
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,880
Are you going to check out Sam and Max if it comes to the Wii Dark Soccer?

442
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
No.

443
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
No?

444
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Why not?

445
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm not interested in it.

446
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Aw, sorry to hear that.

447
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,600
Drew Nami, are you a Sam and Max fan?

448
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Uh, used to be, as of the original.

449
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,840
You remember, you have to talk into a mic, or else people can't hear you.

450
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,680
I thought I turned on and pointed at me.

451
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
That's alright.

452
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,120
Uh, I'm probably going to play it, if I don't have to buy it.

453
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,640
Gotcha so if you can borrow it from somebody or something, you'll play it.

454
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,640
Gotcha.

455
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,880
Uh, Black Wolf, who's a big Sam and Max fan in chat, says the first season is six episodes

456
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,800
and the second season is five episodes.

457
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,320
You know, the reason why I probably thought it was eight is because of the time I went

458
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,800
on the game tab to check it out.

459
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,240
Probably we had the six and then two from the second season, so I probably thought,

460
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
oh, there's eight of them.

461
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Okay, six and five.

462
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,800
Still, that's not a bad deal for eleven episodes.

463
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,640
That's still pretty it's because it'll be a thirty, forty hour game, that's the size

464
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
of most games.

465
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
That'll be a good deal.

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,520
Uh, this is also going to be a good deal, would be a Super Smash Bros. Brawl sequel.

467
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,320
It's also kind of a duh, but at the same time, it would be interesting if a Brawl sequel

468
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,480
came to the Wii, because if you think about the previous Nintendo consoles, they only

469
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,440
had one Smash Bros. game apiece.

470
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,160
Nintendo 64 had that Smash Bros. game, which I want to say was originally developed for

471
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,320
the Super Nintendo, but was brought over to the 64 when the, you know, console life switched

472
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
up a little bit.

473
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,640
Uh, and then the GameCube had one, now the Wii has its one, so it'd be kind of weird

474
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,160
if there was a second one on the Wii.

475
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,160
I don't think Nintendo plans to move away from the Wii anytime soon, so it would be

476
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,000
kind of interesting if we got a sequel.

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,560
What is the basis for this?

478
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,640
Well, Nintendo is, in one of their latest surveys, they do these surveys all the time

479
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,260
on their website, they're asking a question about how likely would you be to buy a sequel

480
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,000
to Super Smash Bros. Brawl on a scale of one to seven?

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,400
One being I wouldn't buy it, seven being I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

482
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm sure most people are saying, seven, seven, seven!

483
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,780
I don't know how many people wouldn't say seven, but it'll be interesting.

484
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,640
What else can they do with, uh, Smash Bros. Brawl?

485
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
I mean...

486
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
A DS version?

487
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,040
Ah, there you go.

488
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,720
I bet, I bet that's it.

489
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,400
I bet that's exactly what they're gonna do, I bet it'll be a DS version.

490
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,360
You think if there was a DS version it would be just a dumbed down, uh, same version you

491
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,920
kind of have on the Wii now, or do you think they'd, uh, actually take the time to make

492
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,880
something kind of new, maybe with some more DS-centric characters?

493
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,360
Well, keep in mind the DS is basically a handheld Nintendo 64.

494
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
I guess that's true.

495
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,800
So it'd probably be more like a throwback to the old Smash Bros.

496
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
True.

497
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,720
Of course they're gonna whore this out, you know, but I don't think it's gonna come any

498
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,720
time soon.

499
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,920
I think it'll be at least maybe a year or two off if they're gonna do something like

500
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
that.

501
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,280
Jaded in chat says, the PictoChat level where you can draw your own pics.

502
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,640
That might be kind of fun.

503
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,320
I bet the online, online seems to work a little better on the DS than it does on the Wii.

504
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,240
I bet online would work better.

505
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,440
Yeah, I guess.

506
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,320
The PictoChat level would be full of, like, cocks or something.

507
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,800
I'm just, I'm not too, I'm not too confident with, uh, Nintendo and their online.

508
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,680
Ross Steel UT says, I say we bring back the Virtual Boy with Smash Bros.

509
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
No!

510
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Yes.

511
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I do not want a migraine.

512
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,520
Or, unless it's a playable character, that'd be cool.

513
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,880
I would not mind the migraine.

514
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,400
They should do a Super Nintendo version of Smash Bros., that'd be cool.

515
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Why?

516
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
It's gone!

517
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,840
The system's, like, dead and gone.

518
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,360
It's as dead as this station.

519
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,160
Bring it on to the, uh, DS.

520
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,600
Do it all 2D.

521
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,320
I would, I would believe that a Smash Bros. would come to DS.

522
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,800
Do a Smash Bros. game in, like, the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 engine or something like that.

523
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Well, we'll see what happens.

524
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Maybe the arcade Smash Bros., eh.

525
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Maybe that'll be the thing, is they'll get third parties on board.

526
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I don't know.

527
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
We'll see.

528
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,000
But, uh, regardless, I'm sure that this survey is a no-brainer.

529
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,020
It depends on who they're surveying.

530
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,080
If they surveyed us, I'm sure we'd all be saying, why even waste money on a friggin'

531
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
survey like that?

532
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Well, I think it's one sequel, so for a really popular game, I have no idea.

533
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,480
In other news, water is indeed wet.

534
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,920
Oh, and Jamie, just think of the Virtual Boy possibilities, you can have the Teleroboxer

535
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
stage.

536
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
No.

537
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,920
No.

538
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
No.

539
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
No.

540
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,400
The migraines are not worth it.

541
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,780
My Virtual Boy is sealed in foam in a plastic case, never to be opened again.

542
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,120
I wanna play Virtual Boy.

543
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,120
I haven't played one in years, I was, like, 12.

544
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
I'll bring it next week.

545
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
I'll bring the Blockbuster one.

546
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
It'll be fun.

547
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,520
We have one of the ones that Blockbuster was selling, that's why we have the nice hard

548
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
case and everything.

549
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,680
Can we hook up Virtual Boy to Justin.tv somehow?

550
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,880
Have the headache cam?

551
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,080
It wouldn't be easy, but you could do it.

552
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,280
That might be fun.

553
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,440
Yes, I say, we should have some type of competition with the Virtual Boy, like, who can play the

554
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,600
longest without having a seizure?

555
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,600
Throwing up.

556
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,360
Or throwing up.

557
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,880
And Cheeseburger in chat asks the definitive question, if Chuck Norris was in Brawl, what

558
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,680
would be his final smash?

559
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,400
An overused joke.

560
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,760
Don't you know that that hand is actually Chuck Norris' hand?

561
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,040
Let's move on to the next story, please, before the Chuck Norris jokes.

562
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,520
God, you guys are chinging to me.

563
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
That's okay.

564
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,740
Well, you know, there is actually, for anybody who has been waiting, and I know lots of people

565
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,400
have for Mario Kart Wii, there's gonna be a really awesome launch ready for it at midnight

566
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,920
on the verge of the 26th to the 27th.

567
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,760
And guess where it's gonna be?

568
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
My pants.

569
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
No.

570
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Sam's Club!

571
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,180
Cause no one knows how to get down like Sam's Club.

572
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:09,840
You can go to Sam's Club and it'll even have 15 Wii consoles on hand.

573
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,040
Will they have the ladies serving the samples of the little teeny weenies?

574
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
Dude, I would go just for that.

575
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,080
What they forget to mention is those 15 Wii consoles are being sold together in like a

576
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,680
giant family pack of Wiis.

577
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:29,120
No, it's the Wii plus like 50 controllers and shitty games and a box of Fruit Loops.

578
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,120
The Sam's Club actually realized that they're not a club and they're just a store.

579
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,240
And a two gallon container of mayonnaise.

580
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,640
Cause, you know, when you think video games, you think Sam's Club.

581
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,200
I bought the Vio at Sam's Club.

582
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Here's my question.

583
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,480
It's all Sam's Clubs that are doing this or is it just a few?

584
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,680
It's not actually saying a few, it's just saying Sam's Club.

585
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,440
We should party down at Sam's Club.

586
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Here's what I'm thinking.

587
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:06,200
If it is at every Sam's Club, we go to the Sam's Club out in freaking Roseville, okay?

588
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,400
Cause Roseville knows how to get down, okay?

589
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
There's like a lot of retired people out in Roseville.

590
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,120
Okay, what we'll do, we'll go there and we'll dress to the nine.

591
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,540
Like we'll dress in party hats and boas and you know, we have those hats.

592
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,200
We have those hats, the little Mario hats that Rama gave us some time ago.

593
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
We can wear our little hats, it'd be fun.

594
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Count me in.

595
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,080
You know what?

596
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,860
If they're doing it, we gotta do that.

597
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,860
You know what?

598
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,860
What?

599
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,940
I'll just have my copy the day it comes out.

600
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,440
You don't want to go party at Sam's Club?

601
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,960
I'll go come home with Smash Brothers.

602
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,320
Dude, two gallons of mayonnaise, Jamie.

603
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Rob.

604
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
What?

605
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Rob.

606
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Rob.

607
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
What?

608
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,440
Loki, are you down with the Sam's Club party?

609
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,760
Fuck that, I'll probably already have the game by the time the thing launches.

610
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,400
God, you people are no fun at all.

611
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
You don't go for the game.

612
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,440
I sit in line for a wee.

613
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,160
How can I get excited about Sam's Club?

614
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
That's the point.

615
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
That's the point.

616
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,440
We took our lawn chairs and sat in line for a wee.

617
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,040
We'll probably go there and be like, sorry, we're not doing the launch party and be like,

618
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
crap.

619
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,760
I will go and you know why, because I have nothing better to do.

620
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,240
Will anyone go party at Sam's Club with me?

621
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,920
Well if you don't want to go to Sam's Club to get Mario Kart, maybe you want to go to

622
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,800
Japan to get Trauma Center 2.

623
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,400
That's right, the game is actually being slated for the DS.

624
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,680
It's coming back.

625
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:37,400
I guess the second opinion wasn't really a sequel then, but Trauma Center 2 and I guess

626
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,680
the sequel has Dr. Stiles and Nurse Angie tackling the effects of the unanswered mysteries

627
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,040
of the guilt virus from the prequel.

628
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,260
See, the guilt virus is the guilt that you have from not buying the wee version.

629
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,480
That kind of surprises me that the latest one they had on the Nintendo Wii was not Trauma

630
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Center 2.

631
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,640
I just kind of took it as Trauma Center 2.

632
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,920
Of course, there's going to be new characters and different tools and stuff like that.

633
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,000
But pretty much par for the course stuff.

634
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,400
Trauma Center is one of those games where I swear it's one of those blink and you miss

635
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:19,880
it kind of games, but to quote an epic story that once aired on the station and on the

636
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,120
nightly news here locally, it's so much fun.

637
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
Trauma Center is so much fun.

638
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,640
I like making them die.

639
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
I do too.

640
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,300
I love the whole bringing them back to life.

641
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:43,040
The Wii controls in that game are really cool because when you have to do the whole defibrillator

642
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,320
you have to push into the screen onto the body.

643
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
It's really funny.

644
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
I like Trauma Center.

645
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,760
I would think you of all people, Loki, Trauma Center would be one of your favorites.

646
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,600
No, I liked it better when it was called Life and Death and came out early PCs back when

647
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,240
they had Windows 3.1.

648
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,120
Life or death was hardcore and everybody and the only surgeries you'd do would be removing

649
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
appendixes.

650
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Oh my God, life or death was hardcore though.

651
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,080
If you screwed up in that game, you were killing patients left and right.

652
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
It was a very hard game.

653
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,500
Hence why it's called Life and Death in that life and maybe...

654
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,320
They should have called it Life but Mostly Death because that's what that game was.

655
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,900
I was like, I'm going to scribble with the scalpel and you have to read all this stuff

656
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,760
before you go and do the surgeries, but we didn't like to read.

657
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
We just wanted the scalpel.

658
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,760
That's true.

659
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Trauma Center...

660
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Calcipa makes the best suggestion.

661
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,320
In chat, what do you say?

662
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,360
Psychological Trauma Center.

663
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,600
That would be kind of rad.

664
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Yeah.

665
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
All right.

666
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
You know what else is going to be...

667
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
What?

668
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,240
I was going to say, oh no, I have to repair your daddy left you or something.

669
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,440
That is so, so wrong.

670
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
Scalpel.

671
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Look.

672
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,120
We can start with celebrities.

673
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
I know.

674
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Yeah.

675
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,520
See, celebrities are okay to make fun of.

676
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,280
Remember, Dennis Leary said it best.

677
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,400
The best way for all those celebrities, the best therapy for them is Shut the Fuck Up

678
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,720
by Dr. Dennis Leary.

679
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,840
All right, look.

680
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
Let's move on to games.

681
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,220
I do want Trauma Center 2, but I definitely, definitely want this.

682
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,800
I was actually surprised to hear that Final Fantasy IV was not already confirmed for North

683
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,520
America, but then again, this is Squeenix we're talking about.

684
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:23,160
But apparently this week, Final Fantasy IV director Takashi Tokita did confirm that Final

685
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,080
Fantasy IV is being localized for North America.

686
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,040
That was in the latest issue of Nintendo Power.

687
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Okay, wait.

688
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Scratch that.

689
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:36,840
He didn't actually confirm the localization, but I mean, there was English language screenshots

690
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,280
in the article.

691
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,480
It's on the cover of the freaking magazine.

692
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,920
I think it's safe to say the game's coming out over here.

693
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,000
I think it's safe to say the game's coming out here.

694
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,860
I wouldn't know or anything.

695
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,160
Would you know about when the game is coming out here by chance?

696
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,200
I would say it's coming out around here somewhere around here.

697
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
In time for my birthday?

698
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
No.

699
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Damn it.

700
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,920
I can't get you what I was going to get you for your birthday.

701
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,280
Of course, I don't remember when your birthday is, unfortunately.

702
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
June 26th.

703
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
Don't forget it.

704
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
No.

705
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,280
It's not going to be out for my birthday?

706
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
No.

707
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Will it be out in July?

708
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Maybe.

709
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,760
Can we play hot and cold?

710
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
Is it July 15th?

711
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Warm.

712
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
July 17th.

713
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Warmer.

714
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
July 24th.

715
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
No, still warm.

716
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
July 18th.

717
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
What's a Tuesday?

718
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Hold on.

719
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,760
Pulling up a calendar.

720
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,760
This is how we get Loki to tell us secrets now.

721
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
July 22nd.

722
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
No.

723
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
July 15th.

724
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
No.

725
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Are they putting it on a Sunday or something?

726
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
July 20th.

727
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
No, further.

728
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
Forget it.

729
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
It's close to August, okay?

730
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
July 29th.

731
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
No.

732
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
God.

733
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
July 27th.

734
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Right now, it's at the end of July, okay?

735
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Let's just see what that is.

736
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
That's not the only game coming over here.

737
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Oh, whatever.

738
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
No.

739
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
No.

740
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
No.

741
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
No.

742
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
No.

743
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
No.

744
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
No.

745
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
Should we run it over here?

746
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Oh, what else?

747
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,200
Uh, just another game.

748
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,900
Is it Chrono Trigger?

749
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
It's not Chrono Trigger.

750
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Is it Chrono Trigger?

751
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,360
It's another DS game that's already in Japan right now, that I'm showing you the title

752
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
for.

753
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,640
Can I please say that on-

754
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,800
Go ahead.

755
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,080
Dragon Quest V.

756
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Yeah.

757
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,480
Wait, what?

758
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,000
Dragon Quest V.

759
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,100
That's apparently getting localized as well.

760
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,400
Excuse me for a second.

761
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
Should be fun.

762
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,880
Did you just squee in your pants?

763
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
What the hell was that noise?

764
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,080
No, I just squee'd into the mic.

765
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:31,000
Actually, there's another game coming out too, the same day as Final Fantasy IV, but

766
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
it's not for the DS.

767
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,040
It's actually a 360 RPG that's by Square Enix, although it's got the weirdest title ever,

768
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,240
Infinite Undiscovery, so that should be coming around at the same time.

769
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,520
But a lot of stuff can move.

770
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
But they're coming.

771
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,840
Alright, so Dragon Quest V, Final Fantasy IV in July, you didn't hear it here.

772
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
You did not hear it.

773
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
It might not be July.

774
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
That's true.

775
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
Games get pushed back all the time.

776
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Alright.

777
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,120
I have to do Dragon Quest VI, now we're hulking.

778
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,240
Alright, so, but still, where's Chrono Trigger?

779
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,560
I mean, that's the game everybody wants, right?

780
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,160
You can pretty much, okay, let me put it this way.

781
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,940
If it's a Square Enix RPG, and it's being made in Japan, and it's come out in Japan,

782
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,600
you can bet it's going to be localized for here.

783
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,320
Mother 3.

784
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
That's not a Square Enix game.

785
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
That was it.

786
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
That was...

787
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
Nintendo themselves.

788
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Yeah, that was Nintendo.

789
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,680
That's what I call them now, if we're not bringing that over here.

790
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Bastard Nintendo.

791
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Yes, they did.

792
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
It came out over there.

793
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Why not here?

794
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Well, just...

795
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
What's up with that, Nintendo?

796
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,040
Because the same people that own Nintendo own Live 365.

797
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,880
I'll take a detour for a minute to say hello to Rice Princess, who showed up 39 minutes

798
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
late.

799
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,880
How are you?

800
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
I'm good and late.

801
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
How about you?

802
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm fine.

803
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Awesome.

804
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I got you a present.

805
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Okay, then I forgive you for being late.

806
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
Ooh!

807
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
Is that it for me?

808
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
This is it for you.

809
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
Ooh!

810
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
That looks so pretty.

811
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
It's kind of random.

812
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
It is, but they were on sale, and I'm like, oh, they have penguins.

813
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
I will like it.

814
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,720
They're floor mats for the car with penguins on them.

815
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
They're so cute here.

816
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
Wow.

817
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
I accept your gift.

818
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Woo-hoo!

819
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
In lieu of being late.

820
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,520
Your offering pleases kitty.

821
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,320
It smells like new car.

822
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
All right.

823
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Oh, that's weird.

824
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,120
I'm getting high on the floor mats.

825
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,240
And I have to say one other thing.

826
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,760
I got a Captain Crunch Malt from Carl's Jr.

827
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,120
It is so fucking, I mean, flippin' good.

828
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Yeah?

829
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,120
It is.

830
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
It is fucking good.

831
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,120
It's free radio.

832
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,120
Yeah.

833
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Oh, my God.

834
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
It's so yummy.

835
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,120
I know.

836
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
What are they going to do?

837
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Cancel us?

838
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Sorry.

839
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
You cannot be on our station anymore.

840
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
But, yeah, it's pretty good.

841
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,120
So, yeah.

842
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
Okay.

843
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Excellent.

844
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,640
I think we should try to set some sort of Guinness Book of World Records for the most

845
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,480
time fuck has occurred in a podcast.

846
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,040
Maybe for our first all-game show.

847
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
That'll be a nice...

848
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Great idea.

849
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
That'll be great.

850
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,040
We'll bring a little bell and everything.

851
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,280
That'll be, that'll be, no.

852
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
We got to do one show.

853
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,160
We have to do one show over there to get them to like us.

854
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
For those that haven't heard us yet.

855
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
It doesn't have to be the first show.

856
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Yeah.

857
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Besides those...

858
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Yeah, that might do it with that crowd.

859
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,120
Those Guinness Records, you have to have somebody on hand to, like, record, you know.

860
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,640
It has to be all official and stuff.

861
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,080
No, what we'll do, what we'll do the second show over there will be the fuck show.

862
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
We'll do that.

863
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Yay.

864
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,080
We'll lose all of our listeners in one show.

865
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
All right.

866
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
And we'll have one of those little...

867
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,600
We'll do it South Park style, we'll have one of those little click counters in the corner

868
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
of the Justin TV feed.

869
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
We'll do it.

870
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
We'll do it.

871
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Bobby.

872
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Fuck show.

873
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,880
Y or N. Bobby's in chat right now.

874
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,560
Also say hello to Nathan, who's here.

875
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Hello.

876
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,660
How are you?

877
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,800
I am fine.

878
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,620
Was the Captain Crunch milkshake flipping fantastic?

879
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,620
It was.

880
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
It was?

881
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Glad to hear it.

882
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,620
I can't drink it or it might kill me.

883
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:47,360
Because I have to stay away from high fat foods for a month.

884
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,720
But if they had Captain Crunch Jell-O, I'd be all over that shit.

885
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
I'll make you.

886
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Yay.

887
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,320
Rob, you should have a smoothie.

888
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,560
Black Wolf says why.

889
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,960
So fuck show it is.

890
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,160
So what night is that?

891
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,320
It wouldn't be April 13th, it would be the 20th.

892
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,200
It would be the show the day after my birthday.

893
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,080
Well fuck, I'm in.

894
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,520
I think that's a great idea because I'm going to be gone most of that week.

895
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,960
You're going to come for my birthday stuff, right?

896
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I can't.

897
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
I'm going to be out of town.

898
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
I'm sorry.

899
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
Alright, anyway.

900
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
We'll figure something out.

901
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
It will be our late April-

902
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
Oh my god, the show is on 4-20.

903
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
It has to be a fuck show.

904
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Yes.

905
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
I know.

906
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Alright.

907
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Enough about the fuck show.

908
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Jamie, Brownies?

909
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,280
Irene had enough time to go to the bathroom and back and we're still talking about the

910
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
fuck show.

911
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
Wow.

912
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
It's going to be on 4-20.

913
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,360
It's going to be like a really slow, mellow fuck show like, hey man, like, fuck.

914
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
No.

915
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Here's the deal.

916
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
I think this is the rule.

917
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,360
These are the rules for the fuck show.

918
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Okay.

919
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

920
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
What?

921
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,360
4-20 is marijuana day.

922
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,360
It's not cuss day.

923
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,360
I don't get the correlation here.

924
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
It doesn't matter.

925
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Look, we make the rules.

926
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Alright?

927
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Who fucking cares?

928
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Exactly.

929
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
What do we want?

930
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Here's the thing.

931
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
We have to do the show completely normal.

932
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,760
Like, we do the show as always because we don't want to lose all our podcast listeners.

933
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,240
But the contest is who can work the word fuck into their stories the most times and we'll

934
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,200
have, like, a running tally.

935
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Who can work the word into the show?

936
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
That's brilliant.

937
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,080
I have created a monster and it's fucking awesome.

938
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
A brilliant monster.

939
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,720
We should make that an annual thing.

940
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
That would be funny.

941
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
Alright.

942
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
More details to come.

943
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,400
See, I love live radio.

944
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
I love it.

945
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
I cannot imagine not doing this show live.

946
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,980
Can you imagine if we had to leave Live65 and do a tape show?

947
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,120
The magic of doing a live show creates things such as the fuck show.

948
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,320
We'd be like Mariah Carey because she lip syncs her songs all the time.

949
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,600
That's the dumbest joke I've heard in my entire life.

950
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Shut up!

951
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
It's recent because she recently...

952
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Forget it, Daniel.

953
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
It's recently lame.

954
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
You're recently.

955
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
You're always lame.

956
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,480
Jamie News.

957
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,120
In other news, I has a ferret and you bitches don't.

958
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,340
I mean, wait.

959
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:04,320
More stuff for the Wii but not the DS is Final Fantasy Fables Chocobo's Dungeon will be coming

960
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,360
out in the summer over here and it's happy and makes me go squee and it'll be $39.99.

961
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,280
It's about time.

962
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,960
It's essentially the game that was on the DS like already.

963
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,840
So we're getting a DS port on the Wii now.

964
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,560
Well, I think it may be remade a little bit.

965
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
I mean, Wii is like the porting system.

966
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,520
First it was all our PS2 games get ported with Waggle.

967
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Now we're getting DS games.

968
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Well, I guess that's nothing new.

969
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
We had Cookin' Mama.

970
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,520
It's, it's cute and it goes quee.

971
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,840
Are you going to buy the game just because the Chocobo goes quee?

972
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Yeah.

973
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
I am.

974
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,040
Loki, will you hack the game so the Chocobo goes fuck?

975
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,120
No, I don't know how to do that.

976
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Not yet.

977
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Not yet.

978
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:54,320
Anyways, so it has been recently discovered that Konami has trademarked a new name for

979
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,160
a Castlevania game.

980
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,960
The title of the game, which is assumed to be for the DS, is Castlevania.

981
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,440
Order of, and I can't even pronounce the rest, it looks like Ekklesia.

982
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,060
Ekklesia, yeah, that's right.

983
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
Order of Ekklesia.

984
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,200
Is that a musical term?

985
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,720
I thought all the Castlevania games had to have music in them.

986
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,720
Portrait of Ruin did not.

987
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Oh yeah, Portrait of Ruin.

988
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,120
It has to be something artsy and this one's more like logic.

989
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Ekklesia.

990
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
Ekklesia.

991
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
I don't know.

992
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Stop making up words.

993
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,960
I suspect that this game will have someone in the Belmont family fighting a vampire,

994
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,680
probably Dracula, and there will be whips of some sort and possibly magic and hearts

995
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
and stuff.

996
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,440
Okay, hold on.

997
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm using my mind reading techniques right now.

998
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,120
Something tells me this game will have holy water as a weapon.

999
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
And crosses.

1000
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Yes, and crosses.

1001
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Maybe daggers.

1002
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
And an axe.

1003
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,200
And one of the characters will have a whip.

1004
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,200
You heard it here first, I'm telling you.

1005
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,240
When are they going to have a Castlevania game where you fight the Belmonts?

1006
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,000
They have had one, Symphony of the Night.

1007
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
You fight the Belmonts?

1008
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You fight Richter?

1009
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's right.

1010
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Wasn't that at the second castle?

1011
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,600
Sort of, but he's not like the main boss.

1012
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,760
He is unless you go do the thing where you have to go fight Shaft.

1013
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,960
He is the main boss, totally, if you're not wearing the sunglasses.

1014
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Exactly.

1015
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,360
That's the only time he actually is.

1016
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,320
And there's Aria of Sorrow.

1017
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
I hadn't played that one.

1018
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,000
He is a boss, though.

1019
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,560
Richter is awesome.

1020
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,200
I like his Ryu look and Rondo of Blood.

1021
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,560
I mean like you fight the Belmont family.

1022
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Like they're the bad guys.

1023
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,560
All of them.

1024
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,000
Like, I don't know, because you always fight Dracula or something like that.

1025
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
It's like, come on.

1026
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Poor Shaft.

1027
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Castlevania.

1028
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,440
He fucks up the Belmont family reunion.

1029
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
DS.

1030
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
Aw, yeah.

1031
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,640
Dracula's gonna fuck you up.

1032
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,880
I would get me to buy a Castlevania game again.

1033
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,080
I haven't really been into the Castlevania series on the DS.

1034
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,080
I don't know why.

1035
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,520
I love the Castlevania series.

1036
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,440
I don't like the 3D Castlevanias.

1037
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,160
I mean, they're okay.

1038
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
Like what?

1039
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
64?

1040
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
No.

1041
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,160
Like Lament of Innocence.

1042
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Curse of Darkness.

1044
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,160
They're okay.

1045
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,480
I like my 2D Castlevania.

1046
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,560
Yeah, I understand that.

1047
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Yeah.

1048
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,160
Well, despite whatever it is they're putting out on the DS, it's working, because Nintendo

1049
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,560
is supreme when it comes to Japanese hardware and software sales, and this is per the latest

1050
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,040
issue of Famitsu Magazine.

1051
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,880
The Nintendo DS and the Wii have sold 6.3 and 3.7 million units.

1052
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,640
That's 6.3 million for the DS, 3.7 for the Wii.

1053
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:47,980
And Wii Fit is selling like crazy in Japan, 1.76 million units.

1054
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,360
Nintendo has the top five spots in software, so this is still selling like crazy in Japan.

1055
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:00,280
I'm not sure how this is news, because that's kind of obvious to me, but it's been circulating

1056
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,840
in the blogs this week, so we thought we'd let you know.

1057
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,080
But if you want to know what the top five games are right now out of the house of Nintendo,

1058
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,140
Wii Fit, Mario Party DS, I actually kind of surprised me that's so high, Wii Sports, because

1059
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,600
I believe in Japan they sold it separately, don't forget, Super Smash Brothers Brawl,

1060
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,440
and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

1061
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,220
Those are the top five games.

1062
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,960
Don't hate on Pokemon, don't hate.

1063
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,880
I don't hate as much as I want.

1064
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,320
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon doesn't really count because it's two games, so.

1065
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
That rhymes.

1066
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,840
Oh, that's true, that's a little bit of cheating, isn't it?

1067
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
Yeah.

1068
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
All right, cheaters.

1069
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Pokey cheaters, cheater-mons.

1070
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Cheater-mons.

1071
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Cheater, cheater.

1072
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:44,120
All right, so yeah, Nintendo's making a lot of money in Japan.

1073
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
Go Fig.

1074
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Wow, that's news.

1075
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,960
What else is new?

1076
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,200
I don't know, you tell me what else is new.

1077
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,840
This has to do with old stuff for something new.

1078
00:42:54,840 --> 00:43:00,200
There has been a fact sheet released for details on Mario Kart Wii, and for anyone who's wanting

1079
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,960
to play with their classic controller or the GameCube controller, it has been said that

1080
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,360
certain moves will not be able to be used with those controllers.

1081
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
Like snaking?

1082
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
I say hooray.

1083
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Oh, wait, they do-

1084
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,360
It doesn't say specifically.

1085
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:19,320
Ah, they took snaking out of the game altogether, I think we talked about that last week, but

1086
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
that's good.

1087
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:26,080
But it's basically saying that by using the Wiimote and Nunchuk together, you're supposed

1088
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,000
to have full playability in the game, but those people are going to have an advantage

1089
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,380
over the people using the older controller schemes.

1090
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,640
I have a feeling that it's not so bad as people are making it out to be.

1091
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,000
I think it'll probably be because I think you can do different little tricks and stuff,

1092
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,920
not just one trick when you're doing jumps to get boosts and stuff.

1093
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,840
So you probably will be able to do one trick on the GameCube or classic controller or something

1094
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:57,300
like that, and then the people that have the Wii can use the controller to do different

1095
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,960
tricks using the motion controls.

1096
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,340
Because with that controller turned sideways or something, there's definitely not that

1097
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,720
many buttons to use, and so a lot of it's motion controls, so I don't see why they couldn't

1098
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,160
translate that stuff into button presses.

1099
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
It's just sheer laziness.

1100
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,800
Do you think the game's going to control as well with the classic controller anyway?

1101
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,440
Because it seems to me like this game is going to be calibrated for that motion control that

1102
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,440
an analog stick can't quite replicate.

1103
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
You know what I mean?

1104
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,600
I still think it'll be fine with the classic controller.

1105
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,720
I've played Brawl with the classic controller, and I plan on playing this game.

1106
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
But it's different.

1107
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
Brawl doesn't rely on motion so much, you know what I mean?

1108
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,880
I plan on playing this game with the classic controller, and if that doesn't work, there's

1109
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,680
always the remote nunchuck, which you can just use the analog stick on that, and then

1110
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,840
some of the motion controls with the remote, because that's not gimped on it.

1111
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,400
But I don't think it's going to be a big deal, and the fact that they would do that to try

1112
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,840
to force people to buy their stupid, you know, possibly use their stupid steering wheel controller

1113
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,520
or something like that, I think it's kind of lame.

1114
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,520
Besides, that steering wheel's going to give them problems.

1115
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,520
We'll see.

1116
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,240
I'm looking forward to the game nevertheless.

1117
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,160
It's going to control a lot differently, that's for sure.

1118
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,600
But as long as it's better than Double Dash.

1119
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Yeah.

1120
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,760
Well, this is kind of neat.

1121
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,520
It's a homemade game for the Nintendo system.

1122
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,700
It's a game called Glider.

1123
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,000
It's made by a company called Retro Zone.

1124
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,200
I guess it's a remake, I think, of a game that came out on the Mac or something like

1125
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
that.

1126
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,960
But the interesting thing about it is the game will have download content, but it's

1127
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,440
not as easy as it sounds.

1128
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,480
It's not just like something you can pop into, I don't know, the internet and download it.

1129
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,800
You actually have to reflash the cart, and it requires a $70 accessory to do it.

1130
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,280
Wow, what a bargain.

1131
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,720
But you can get new levels and stuff, and that same accessory will let you dump ROMs

1132
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,520
and crap like that.

1133
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,560
But it's just still kind of neat to see them actually, first off, making new games, and

1134
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:06,680
secondly, allowing you to add new levels to it.

1135
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,360
Aren't there still new games for the Nintendo being made in countries like Taiwan and stuff?

1136
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,400
Because didn't we see a version of one of the Tekken games, like I get an NES port or

1137
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
something recently?

1138
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
I've seen some weird stuff.

1139
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,200
Oh, and those RPGs I've been seeing, like Final Fantasy VII ported to the NES and that

1140
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,200
stuff.

1141
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah.

1142
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,120
And then there's also one that I saw, which is Contra III, ported to the NES.

1143
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,400
The Titanic game, that looked like tons of fun.

1144
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,480
Yeah, so, I don't know.

1145
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
It's interesting.

1146
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,360
Hell, they're still making like, Vectrix games and stuff like that.

1147
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,080
There's always a fan of something somewhere.

1148
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,400
Would you play a game based off Titanic on the NES?

1149
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,160
No.

1150
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,040
Even though Leonardo DiCaprio dies?

1151
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,040
No.

1152
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,780
Well, if you are interested in playing this game, Glider, you can find it on the website

1153
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,280
RetroUSB.com.

1154
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,200
It's I believe like $50, no $42 currently it's on backorder, but it'll be coming out

1155
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
early April.

1156
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,360
The only bad thing about it is it's black and white, because I really do think it came

1157
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,880
out originally on a Mac, the game, I guess it's from 1989.

1158
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,720
But what's cool though is it comes with a cardboard box, a printed manual just like

1159
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,560
the old NES games, and of course there's the black dust sleeve and that kind of thing.

1160
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,560
And it's region free.

1161
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,560
This is great.

1162
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,320
Someone in Justin TV reminded me of this, Akuma JP in Justin TV Chats mentioned the

1163
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:40,320
V. Not the we, but the V, speaking of innovative software to come out of other countries.

1164
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,040
We need to get a V here in studio.

1165
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,040
Are we able to do that?

1166
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
They're expensive.

1167
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,960
I don't really want one.

1168
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,600
The company also makes some interesting things.

1169
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:57,160
They have a game called Airball, another game called Sudoku 2007, and they make reproductions

1170
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,720
of the Nintendo World Championship 1990 cards.

1171
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,720
Nice.

1172
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,120
That's pretty cool.

1173
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
Sudoku, yay.

1174
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,120
What?

1175
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,120
I said Sudoku, yay.

1176
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
Sudoku?

1177
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Yes.

1178
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
Okay.

1179
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,120
Shut up.

1180
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:16,760
Let's see if there's some non-Sudoku games coming out on some very...

1181
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
Shut up again.

1182
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,280
I played a lot of Sudoku while I was in the hospital because I was really bored.

1183
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,280
And?

1184
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,280
And I don't want to ever play anymore.

1185
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,280
Ew.

1186
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,280
Shut up.

1187
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,280
All right.

1188
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,280
I just got split from our chat room.

1189
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,280
Oh, everybody came back.

1190
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
I guess the split got fixed.

1191
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,560
Live radio.

1192
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,400
It has its ups and downs.

1193
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Let's see.

1194
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,840
Let's look at the release calendars for games coming out soon.

1195
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
We'll start off in Japan.

1196
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:44,360
Coming out on the Xbox 360 in Japan on April the 10th, Turok is coming out.

1197
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,360
Yay.

1198
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,360
It's not...

1199
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,240
Oh, yeah, did you pre-order your copy, right?

1200
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,240
I did, yes.

1201
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
And then I named my kid after Turok.

1202
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
It was great.

1203
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,240
Poor kid.

1204
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,120
I wonder if he gets teased.

1205
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,480
What grade would he be in now?

1206
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,840
Like still in elementary school or...

1207
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
What?

1208
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
The kid that was named Turok.

1209
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
I don't know.

1210
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,840
You remember that contest?

1211
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,080
They got paid a million dollars to name their kid Turok?

1212
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,080
No, I don't remember that.

1213
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,200
You host a video game show and you do not know this?

1214
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,040
I don't remember old news.

1215
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,600
It ain't that old.

1216
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,080
This is like, I don't know, 10 years old or something.

1217
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,080
All right.

1218
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,960
By the way, we apologize that our audio is so fucked up in the studio tonight, but something

1219
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:28,040
about that microphone that they're using in the back is really sensitive, so if you put

1220
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,040
it like it...

1221
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,040
Oh, I'm sorry.

1222
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,040
I'll talk like right here.

1223
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,040
There you go.

1224
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
That's a perfect level.

1225
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
Wonderful.

1226
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,040
Live radio.

1227
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,040
Back to Japan.

1228
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,280
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, Mario Kart Wii makes its way out on April the 10th, as

1229
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,600
well as Karous Wii.

1230
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,760
That's not Kid Akaris.

1231
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,640
That's K-A-R-O-U-S.

1232
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,080
And then Neo Geo Stick 2 comes out as well.

1233
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,080
I'm not sure if that's a joystick.

1234
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,880
Oh, it's just a joystick.

1235
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,880
I thought it was actually a game for a minute.

1236
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,160
A stick figure game where you're trying to think of a stick fighter.

1237
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,160
I don't know.

1238
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Stick Fighter, exactly.

1239
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:07,320
On the PlayStation 2, Battle of Sunrise comes out from Sunrise Interactive, so I wonder

1240
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,360
if it's like the employees fight each other.

1241
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
That would be cool.

1242
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,240
That would be actually kind of a rad game.

1243
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
No.

1244
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
This looks like...

1245
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,240
What kind of game does this look like?

1246
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,000
It looks like kind of like one of those robot fighting games that you see quite a bit of

1247
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
in Japan.

1248
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,440
It looks like it's got a tech element to it as well.

1249
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,240
That must be the gist of it, probably some type of tech game.

1250
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:39,560
Also coming out in Japan on the Nintendo DS, Oshiri Kajiri Mushi no Rhythm Lesson DS comes

1251
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
out from Sega.

1252
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,040
Wait, did you say the first word was...

1253
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,040
Oshiri Kajiri Mushi.

1254
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,040
That means butt.

1255
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,840
I'm probably just mispronouncing it because I horribly do that, but it's a music game.

1256
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,900
Learn how to dance like these scary looking critters with flowers coming out of their

1257
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,800
heads on the cover of the game.

1258
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,720
Maybe they're saying move your butt, rhythm dancing, whatever it's called.

1259
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,720
Maybe.

1260
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,960
If you live in Japan and you've got no rhythm, hope is on the way.

1261
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:19,360
On the PSP, the only game coming out on the 10th, Nanpure and Okake Puzzle 10,000 Mon.

1262
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,920
I think it's just a Sudoku game.

1263
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:22,920
I think that's what they call it.

1264
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Yay, Sudoku.

1265
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,920
Oh, shut up.

1266
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,920
You shut up.

1267
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,560
How many Sudoku games do they have in the simple series?

1268
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,320
It's just nuts.

1269
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,400
It's silly because you can just play it for free online.

1270
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,600
I don't know why you'd buy a game.

1271
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,240
I'm going to remember that, though, that oshiri means butt.

1272
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,040
Hey, Justin TV, want me to show my oshiri?

1273
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,120
No, please don't proposition that.

1274
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,360
I would have to see those.

1275
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,680
Oh, my God, Glenn.

1276
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
When did he get here?

1277
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,880
Nobody knows who Glenn is, never mind.

1278
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,880
Nobody knows that joke outside of wow.

1279
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,880
I know.

1280
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,560
I kind of regret saying that.

1281
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:10,080
According to Alpha Canonogram, it's a butt-biting-bug game.

1282
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,080
Sounds like fun.

1283
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:15,200
All right.

1284
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,840
And no, I'm not going to show my butt on the Justin TV cam because somebody would, some

1285
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,080
sick asshole would highlight it, so I'm not going to do that.

1286
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:24,720
Let's move on.

1287
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,120
Let's move on with other release dates, please.

1288
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Okay.

1289
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,920
How about some for the UK?

1290
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,920
How about it?

1291
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,640
A bunch of stuff on the 11th.

1292
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,160
We have Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, Trials and Tribulations, Soldier of Fortune Payback,

1293
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,560
The History Channel, Battle for the Pacific on a bunch of systems, Assassin's Creed, Altair's

1294
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:51,840
Chronicles, Assassin's Creed, Director's Cut Edition, Draglade, Mario Kart Wii, Sam & Max

1295
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,520
Episode 205, What's New, Beelzebub.

1296
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,240
I think that's a funny name, although I still won't play the game.

1297
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:07,680
UEFA Euro 2008, Victorious Boxers Challenge, so you can punch people in the face.

1298
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,000
Sounds like fun.

1299
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,120
That does sound like fun.

1300
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,000
I want to punch people in the face.

1301
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,840
Well, Drew's right there.

1302
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
Hi.

1303
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Come here so I can punch you.

1304
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:20,200
Is that it?

1305
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,200
Yes.

1306
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,200
Okay.

1307
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,840
In the US, we're getting a bunch of crap this week.

1308
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,920
Yay, crap.

1309
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:28,920
My favorite.

1310
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,720
Anyways, let's start things off right.

1311
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:36,360
Dirty Dancing the Game is coming to PC.

1312
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,720
Hooray.

1313
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,040
There's a game for the DS called Fab Five Soccer, and no, it doesn't have anything to

1314
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,000
do with Queer Eye, although that'd be weird.

1315
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,240
There's a game called Plushies for the DS.

1316
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,880
That's also another weird title.

1317
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,880
Wow.

1318
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,880
Awesome.

1319
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,920
What the hell is wrong with us?

1320
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
Make some games that aren't stupid.

1321
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,800
Dude, they should make a game called Furries.

1322
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,480
No, they shouldn't.

1323
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,680
You know you would at least rent it, just to see what it's about.

1324
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,280
No, I would not waste my money.

1325
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,960
It's called Second Life.

1326
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,880
It totally is.

1327
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,640
The orange box is going to be broken up this week, so we have Half-Life 2, the episode

1328
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,280
pack, which I believe is episode one and two.

1329
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,800
Then we've also got Portal coming out on PC, and then finally, of course, Team Fortress

1330
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,800
2.

1331
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,760
On the Wii, Minicopter Adventure Flight, it's a game where you get to play around with a

1332
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,520
RC helicopter.

1333
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:34,020
There's also Summer Sports Paradise Island.

1334
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:39,080
It's a Wii game with lawn darts, which are illegal, I guess, in the United States, but

1335
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,080
now you can throw lawn darts.

1336
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,480
Lawn darts are illegal here?

1337
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Yeah.

1338
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
Dude, we had those growing up.

1339
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,480
Yeah, they're illegal now.

1340
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,480
Ooh, I'm reporting you to cop dog.

1341
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Don't fight it.

1342
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,480
You don't know cop dog.

1343
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,480
You don't know cop dog.

1344
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,480
Report this.

1345
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
Got hurt.

1346
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,480
Let's see here.

1347
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,200
Also on the Wii and PlayStation 2, Baroque is coming out this week.

1348
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,720
On PlayStation 2, Arcana Heart, which is an all-girl anime fighting game from Atlus.

1349
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:03,720
Hot.

1350
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:12,040
And also, Fetal Fury Battle Archives Volume 2, coming out on PlayStation 2 for $14.99.

1351
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:20,920
On PC, we have Overclocked, a history of violence, Assassin's Creed.

1352
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:29,160
And finally, oh, let's see here, Sam and Max Episode 205, What's New Beelzebub, will be

1353
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:34,800
coming out on GameTap and PC, and I guess Civil War Mysteries as well.

1354
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,800
Hey!

1355
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Sorry.

1356
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,600
We make fun on this show.

1357
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,520
And I think that's it, and there's, as we mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, Ikaruga

1358
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,640
is rumored to be coming out this week on Xbox Live Arcade.

1359
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,640
Hopefully that's not broken.

1360
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,080
And hopefully it isn't a shitty port, because that'll make me cry.

1361
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,560
Where is my radiant silver gun?

1362
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,280
Questions or comments from chat room.

1363
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,360
Qualtippo says, the furry game would be rated D for drama, because I guess there's a lot

1364
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,720
of drama in the furry scene.

1365
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
I would know.

1366
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,720
Really?

1367
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
You're kidding.

1368
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:12,200
Let's see, Katamari's Forever in chat says, I heard about that, speaking of Arcana Heart.

1369
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,580
Eleven girl fighters, girl on girl action.

1370
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,160
They have a dog girl in there.

1371
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,200
I swear to God, it's a chick that's dog.

1372
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,320
Is that like a manbear pig?

1373
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,320
This has been done before.

1374
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,360
It was called the Asuka 120% series.

1375
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,880
So it's not manbear pig.

1376
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,920
So this is nothing original, people.

1377
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,920
I didn't know this.

1378
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,440
Rama says cosplayers hate furries.

1379
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:43,000
I didn't know there was this war between cosplayers and furries.

1380
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,080
Dude, that should be a fighting game.

1381
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:48,320
I guess one kind of drama hates the other kind of drama.

1382
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,480
Cosplayers versus furries.

1383
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,480
I would buy that.

1384
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,480
I'm like, I'm just versus ninja.

1385
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,480
Exactly.

1386
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,480
Oh yeah?

1387
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,480
Cowboys.

1388
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,200
And SSG100 Matt says, no, no, no.

1389
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,640
Everyone hates furries.

1390
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,960
Aw, poor furries.

1391
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,120
Not poor furries.

1392
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,760
They're completely cognizant of what they're doing.

1393
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,760
Dude I would love.

1394
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,600
Okay, so what are the ideas for games we've had?

1395
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,320
We've had laser cats.

1396
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,640
We've had, what else do we have on a previous show?

1397
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,280
We need to write these things down.

1398
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
You do.

1399
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,280
Put them on the wiki or something.

1400
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,280
Something?

1401
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,280
Damn it.

1402
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,280
Someone had chatters?

1403
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,120
Wasn't there something they had to do with paper?

1404
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,320
Yeah, it was one of those games, because there was a game for DS coming out that you could

1405
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
just play on paper.

1406
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,040
Like it was like Pictionary or something on the DS.

1407
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,640
I remember talking about that in the previous show.

1408
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,200
It was something you could play with a pen and paper.

1409
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,080
And now I want to add this to the list.

1410
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,880
Cosplayers versus furries.

1411
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,720
An epic fighting battle.

1412
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,720
Bob's voice.

1413
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:45,720
The game.

1414
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:46,720
No, no.

1415
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,720
Scratch that from the list.

1416
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:48,720
That wouldn't sell.

1417
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,720
L.O.L.

1418
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:54,400
That was the name of the game.

1419
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,160
There was a game on the DS called L.O.L. and it was something you could just play with

1420
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,080
a fucking piece of paper and a pen.

1421
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,960
The whole premise of that game was to get people to laugh or something like that and

1422
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,920
they would vote on which drawing is the funniest or something like that.

1423
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,920
That's it.

1424
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,900
Yes, it's called pen and paper.

1425
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,680
Can somebody please add that to the wiki?

1426
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,680
Can our wiki gods like AJ Mix or Dark Tetsuya or somebody, can our wiki gods add like a

1427
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,920
page of our great ideas?

1428
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,280
And be sure to put on the bottom patent pending.

1429
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,560
Awesome.

1430
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,280
GameStop.com is down.

1431
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,800
Hopefully that means that they've closed down.

1432
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,800
They're like, we give up.

1433
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,520
We have too much money.

1434
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,880
Will they close down all the freaking pre-orders for cosplayers versus furries, shut them down?

1435
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,480
It's like, oh my god, I can't handle this.

1436
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,480
Anyways.

1437
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,000
In fact, I would actually like to see some of our listeners go into a GameStop to pre-order

1438
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:47,520
cosplayers versus furries because you know they'll take your $5 for anything and I'd

1439
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,840
like to see what happens.

1440
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,440
If it's not in the system, they can't do it because it prints up a receipt.

1441
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,480
Damn it.

1442
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:01,720
This is the extent of my knowledge from Dan managing a GameStop.

1443
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,280
We should probably move on.

1444
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
Can we?

1445
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,280
Yes, please.

1446
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,280
Yes.

1447
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,000
So if that's it for the US releases.

1448
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,520
I think it is at least.

1449
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,680
How did release dates turn into cosplayers versus furries?

1450
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,680
You did it.

1451
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,320
That was your fault, Rob.

1452
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,600
You know it.

1453
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,040
It was an April Fool's joke.

1454
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:23,360
You know it's actually not the first anymore.

1455
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,020
Well I'm trying to transition into talking about some of the April Fool's Day pranks

1456
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,760
from around the web and you know I gotta start with this.

1457
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,960
This week we had so many April Fool's Day pranks because everyone gets in on it except

1458
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,080
for Orange Launch Radio this year.

1459
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,080
We didn't do an April Fool's Day prank because we had depressing news.

1460
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,880
So the holiday was kind of ruined for us.

1461
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,280
However, the IGN trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie.

1462
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,640
What the fuck?

1463
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,320
Somebody spent like thousands of dollars on it.

1464
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,320
Did you see that trailer?

1465
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,320
I did see that trailer.

1466
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,480
Didn't it make you like want to like come?

1467
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,480
Not at all.

1468
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,000
It was actually pretty well done.

1469
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
It was okay.

1470
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,440
Some of it was hokey, but it looked like a sci-fi movie to me.

1471
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,200
What do you expect from a sci-fi channel?

1472
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,920
If they put a decent budget behind it and maybe had a good writer or something.

1473
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:12,000
I didn't believe for a minute it was real because it didn't have a single star in it

1474
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,440
and a movie like Zelda would at least have a star in it somewhere like Ian McKellen playing

1475
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:22,480
the old man that says it's tough out there to go alone here take this or something but

1476
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,640
he'd say it in his voice.

1477
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,960
It's dangerous to go alone.

1478
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,960
Thank you.

1479
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,960
That's what it is.

1480
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,960
It's dangerous.

1481
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:28,960
Sean Connery.

1482
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,960
It's dangerous to go alone.

1483
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:30,960
It's dangerous.

1484
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,960
No you can't so you should stop.

1485
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,880
But there would be at least one famous person so that's why this thing couldn't be real

1486
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,880
and the CGI was a little hokey but I thought it was pretty amazing the work that they did

1487
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,880
do.

1488
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,160
For an April Fool's joke it was awesome.

1489
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,080
Yeah they put a lot of effort into it for an April Fool's joke but I wouldn't.

1490
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,920
Did you see the making of trailer?

1491
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,160
Because they did that shit in July of last year.

1492
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,840
They did a making of trailer of a trailer.

1493
01:00:54,840 --> 01:01:01,640
Well they had a making of little snippet thing that was released the day after that shows

1494
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,880
you how they did it.

1495
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:08,440
No I didn't check like, oh it's April 2nd time to check and see if there's something

1496
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,520
following up.

1497
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,520
Is this better?

1498
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,520
Yeah.

1499
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
The date was July.

1500
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,520
They did that in July.

1501
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,320
That's the only thing I cared about in there was when did they do it because I wanted to

1502
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:21,160
hear them say why they did it but it was July when they were putting it all together.

1503
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,600
I was just kind of surprised at that.

1504
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,120
Well good job.

1505
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,800
But Loki I noticed there was no Tingle in the movie so there's still hope.

1506
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,520
No I don't think that there was Tingle in the first game either so.

1507
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,920
That's alright they can work it in.

1508
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:35,920
No they can't.

1509
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:36,920
Yeah they can.

1510
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,920
Well they can't but I'm not playing him.

1511
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,160
Oh moving on.

1512
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,360
Yes the legend of me.

1513
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,360
The legend of me?

1514
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,360
The legend of me.

1515
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:51,720
Other April Fool's jokes from around the web, Microsoft actually put together their own

1516
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,860
little thing like they were announcing all these devices that were going to come out

1517
01:01:54,860 --> 01:02:00,440
such as the retro Xbox 360 that had a wood finish on it and the retro controller and

1518
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,520
I thought the hilarious part.

1519
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,160
I like how Microsoft can kind of make fun of themselves because the retro controller

1520
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,880
had like a hundred buttons on it.

1521
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,880
It looked like a typewriter.

1522
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,880
It was kind of funny.

1523
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,880
And then they announced like a virtual headset and my favorite was Xbox Live the board game.

1524
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,360
That was pretty good.

1525
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,480
Oh God.

1526
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,480
What else did we have?

1527
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:24,320
Kotaku did cake kaku for a day or something like not bukkake but cake kaku or something

1528
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,160
like that for a whole day where they were nothing but gaming cakes which was actually

1529
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,480
kind of funny because they do cover a lot of gaming cakes on that blog or at least they

1530
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,540
did in the past year.

1531
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:34,540
What else was there?

1532
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:38,560
Somebody announced My Little Pony for Xbox Live Arcade.

1533
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,560
That's awesome.

1534
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,840
I heard someone said the EA was doing that.

1535
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
That's awesome.

1536
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
Oh don't forget Wow.

1537
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
Oh yeah.

1538
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,480
What did Blizzard do this year?

1539
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,880
I know specifically for Wow they introduced the Bard class.

1540
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,880
That looked hardcore.

1541
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,880
That was good.

1542
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,560
And they had Molten Core the console game.

1543
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
For the Atari toy 600.

1544
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,080
Well did you see how the Bard was supposed to have like guitar with you know like guitar

1545
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,880
hero controls and stuff like that.

1546
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,880
I was actually pretty pissed that that was fake because I think the control scheme would

1547
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:07,920
be stupid but I would like to see Bards in World of Warcraft because Bards are awesome.

1548
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,400
They had for Starcraft 2 they had Tauren Marines.

1549
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,400
Oh yeah.

1550
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,400
Nice.

1551
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
They were beefy.

1552
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,400
I also like the Guild Wars thing.

1553
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
I thought that was cool.

1554
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,880
And Lord of the Rings Online had like giant chickens that you had to fight.

1555
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,880
But nobody cares because it's Lord of the Rings Online.

1556
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,480
And actually speaking of Guild Wars, the Guild Wars wiki and the WoW wiki switched places

1557
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,480
for a day.

1558
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,720
So you tried to go to WoW wiki and it was giving you Guild War quests.

1559
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,720
That's awesome.

1560
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,720
That's great.

1561
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,720
And then vice versa.

1562
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
Brilliant.

1563
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,880
And then there was also the Konami Ubisoft one where they had Altera and Metal Gear Solid

1564
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:47,480
4 and they did like an actual video from in-game and stuff with all that going on.

1565
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,040
And what other ones?

1566
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,040
Oh.

1567
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,480
Dark Tetsuya says Shang Long and Street Fighter IV.

1568
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,480
I was just going to say that.

1569
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,480
That was funny.

1570
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
I don't know.

1571
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:03,840
Oh, Bungie did one where they were showing the Xbox Halo 3 stats, you know how like show

1572
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,640
a little light or whatever where people are playing Halo 3 and apparently it made their

1573
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,560
little cartoon Halo head thing on there.

1574
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:16,560
So I was kind of kind of dumb but I think what else there was.

1575
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,080
Creativity from around the web.

1576
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,080
Yeah.

1577
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,080
What was your favorite prank out of all of them?

1578
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:22,080
I like the Zelda thing.

1579
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,600
I think the Zelda trailer kind of trumped everything.

1580
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:30,040
I mean even though it wasn't like I wasn't going to fall for it, it's still like the

1581
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:31,600
quality of it was very good.

1582
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,880
I think everybody has their guard up on April 1st.

1583
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,360
It would be very hard to fall for a prank.

1584
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,880
Did anyone fall for a prank?

1585
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,640
Chatters, did any of you fall for a prank?

1586
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,840
I know some of our listeners fell for that Zelda thing because we got some emails about

1587
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
it.

1588
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,800
I got my boss to fall for a prank.

1589
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,120
What was that?

1590
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:51,400
My review, my work review was on April 1st.

1591
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,440
Nice.

1592
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,640
And so I was thinking that there was going to be all this stuff but I went in and I was

1593
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:01,360
like well before we start the meeting I have to tell you something really, really important

1594
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,960
and this is bad news for you.

1595
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,000
It's really good news for me but I've been offered a job at the Beau Ravage in Biloxi,

1596
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,640
Mississippi as their massage therapist for some sort of reopening thing so I'm going

1597
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:16,760
to be moving in three weeks and I did it completely deadpan and she just got quiet and looked

1598
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,840
at me and said I'm happy for you and I was like well thank you and also I just completely

1599
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,400
fooled you.

1600
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,000
This is at my annual review.

1601
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Nice.

1602
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,840
But she said that they all got her by, she calls in to check on us every morning and

1603
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,760
that they said that nobody else showed up.

1604
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:39,960
The only April Fools prank I played is I went to our guild forum for WoW.

1605
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,320
I went to the guild forum and I posted a post that says why I quit the guild last night

1606
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:50,320
to go back to Final Fantasy XI and then you open it up and it says yeah right April Fools.

1607
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
That's clever Rob.

1608
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
I know it was great.

1609
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,560
And the worst part is some of us actually believe you.

1610
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,560
I know, I know.

1611
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,640
What about all the Rick Rolling stuff that was going on?

1612
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,640
Oh God.

1613
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:01,240
Rick Rolling is so old.

1614
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:08,080
However, however, there was a clever one that was linked to me of The Muppets.

1615
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,040
I was a beaker and that was cool.

1616
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:19,520
The best Rick Roll was not beaker but in a second it was not game facts which was evil

1617
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:25,800
but it was actually Chris Perillo of Locker Gnome from the Screen Savers announcing his

1618
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:31,800
last video podcast because apparently he had a fight with his woman.

1619
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,800
Right.

1620
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,800
His woman.

1621
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,800
It's always the woman.

1622
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:38,720
Yeah, he just, I'm sorry, I just, he looks away, freeze frame, never going to give you

1623
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,720
up, starts playing.

1624
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,720
I'm like oh God.

1625
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,320
I think my favorite April Fools joke other than the Zelda thing had to have been, and

1626
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,720
I know it was a little late for April Fools but the release of Mr. Driller in there online,

1627
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,720
it's so funny because it doesn't work.

1628
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,400
He's fooled all those people because it's Mr. Driller online and the online portion

1629
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,000
doesn't work.

1630
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,960
You remember Mo who was here a few weeks ago who did a cover of Still Alive, remember that?

1631
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:11,080
She actually has a cover of Never Going to Give You Up on YouTube and that's how we found

1632
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,080
her actually.

1633
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:16,800
That's how Jake found her to begin with and they call it Chick Rolling if you want to

1634
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
link that YouTube.

1635
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,800
Wow.

1636
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,800
So there it is.

1637
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,960
I'm not making that up.

1638
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,320
There's a cover of her doing Never Going to Give You Up.

1639
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,320
It's quite good.

1640
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:29,000
See, April Fools, I guess it's about fooling people obviously and yeah, the Zelda thing

1641
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,160
was pretty good but I kind of like things that make me laugh on April Fools Day and

1642
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,840
definitely the Molten Core console thing just made me crack up.

1643
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,560
Blizzard does good jobs every year with April Fools.

1644
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,880
They do good jobs.

1645
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,280
Let's move on with news because we want to wrap this segment up.

1646
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,640
Well, I have our downloadable content stuff.

1647
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,640

01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,920
Guess what?

1654
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,400
I owned one for reals.

1655
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:21,520
So haha, that's how I got my World Cup soccer.

1656
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,520
A whole bunch of Karaoke Revolution, American Idol stuff, who cares?

1657
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,320
I got to get that game.

1658
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:35,600
Themes, Mr. Driller Online, FIFA Street 3, Brazil, England, France, Italy, Germany, Mexico,

1659
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,120
Spain, USA, Australia.

1660
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:44,040
Pictures, Major League Gaming Got Frag, Major League Gaming Game Battles, Turok Creatures,

Turok Whiskey Company, Wolf Pack, Variety, Mr. Driller Online, more shit, Call of Duty

1662
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:59,520

1663
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,360
Virtual Console in Europe, Yoshi's Cookie.

1664
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:08,240
In the US we got Cruisin' and we got Wonder Boy, which we've talked about for the Metaboli

1665
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:20,480
thing, there's Imprenium Romanum, Buku Dominoes and Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Sins of a Solar

1666
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,440
Empire PC demo is out, so there you go.

1667
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,440
Here's the hilarious thing about the Mr. Driller Online theme, is that when you would download

1668
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,200
it on Xbox 360, what the theme is, is just a bunch of red X's.

1669
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:38,520
Anyhow, let's move on.

1670
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:43,800
Let's see, I was going to say also, yeah, PlayStation Network's not going to have much

1671
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,720
for the next few weeks anyway since they're revamping their store and in the meantime

1672
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:52,760
not putting anything up there, so if you want your free still live like you get in Xbox

1673
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:57,100
360, you're going to have to wait until the 17th, so that sucks.

1674
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,520
Another game though that you're going to have to wait even longer for is The Force Unleashed,

1675
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:04,960
which was originally going to be a July game, but now it's been pushed all the way to September

1676
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,160
16th, where it's hopefully going to stay.

1677
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:14,760
This week though they had some videos showing off the different versions of the game, which

1678
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,440
I guess each game is kind of getting their own exclusive things, like for example the

1679
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:25,240
PlayStation 2 and PSP titles will be getting some exclusive story lines and stuff like

1680
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:29,200
that in the game in the 360 and PS3 versions.

1681
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:34,840
You of course get kick-ass graphics and physics, and then the Wii version they actually have

1682
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:42,920
a battle mode where you can fight different people and also like, you know, Wiimote, lightsaber

1683
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,600
combat and stuff like that, and I believe also the PSP version has some like legacy

1684
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,880
story line modes that you can play through five different story lines through the six

1685
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:57,080
episodes of the movie, so that's kind of neat.

1686
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:01,160
Looks like a pretty awesome game, and like I said, September 16th is when we can see

1687
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:05,160
that in the US.

1688
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,560
Alright.

1689
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:11,040
Are you excited about The Force Unleashed?

1690
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,040
I actually am.

1691
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,520
I'm thinking about picking that up for the 360.

1692
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,240
Star Wars games are usually pretty good.

1693
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,220
I like Lego Star Wars.

1694
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,280
So go figure, we have people trying to connect to life 365 right now and it's not letting

1695
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,280
them in.

1696
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,160
I'm not going to miss this place at all.

1697
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:30,840
The more I think about it, we should have done this a year ago, all right, Rooster Teeth.

1698
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,720
You might not know that name, but you definitely know Red vs. Blue, something that they've

1699
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:39,460
put together for years and years, but you know, they obviously, right, well now they're

1700
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:42,180
going to do something called Reconstruction.

1701
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:46,140
They put out a trailer, a little teaser video that's available on YouTube if you search

1702
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,560
for Reconstruction Rooster Teeth, you'll find it.

1703
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,560
What I find interesting about it though, it's a little bit more serious, at least the trailer

1704
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,320
had a more serious tone, so I guess they're getting away from the funny stuff and maybe

1705
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,520
doing something a little more serious.

1706
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,880
I don't know about that.

1707
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,760
I mean, every series that they've done has been funny.

1708
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,760
I guess that's true.

1709
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,240
I mean, maybe, I don't know, but it would be interesting if they took the different

1710
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,240
direction.

1711
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
It would be interesting.

1712
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:14,400
Maybe it'll be a dramedy, like Ally McBeal was drama but funny, well to some.

1713
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,200
Yeah, that's debatable.

1714
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,240
I never really found it funny.

1715
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,240
Neither did anybody else.

1716
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,240
I never watched it.

1717
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,240
Oh, snap.

1718
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,760
She was too skeleton-like.

1719
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,400
Yeah, that's every time I look at it.

1720
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,640
All right, no more TV critic.

1721
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,640
Back to gaming news.

1722
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,560
Remember when we were talking about the contest for Puzzle Quest, the add-on getting a name?

1723
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,560
No.

1724
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,560
Just kidding.

1725
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,560
Yes, I do.

1726
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Rob.

1727
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,560
What?

1728
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,160
Is that the name of the new expansion?

1729
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,360
Yes, that's the name.

1730
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,360
Try to spell it.

1731
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,760
Anyway, they got 500-plus suggestions and-

1732
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,640
That's it, that's actually kind of sad.

1733
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,640
Only 500.

1734
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:54,640
I know, right?

1735
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,320
And in the end, they got Revenge of the Plague Lord.

1736
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:02,200
Oh, and I was hoping they would pick Puzzle Quest 1.5 to search for more money.

1737
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,600
Did you submit that?

1738
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,640
No, that's Spaceballs 2.

1739
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,680
Ah, yes.

1740
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,400
That's actually kind of a dumb title.

1741
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,400
I don't know.

1742
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,680
It doesn't make me go OMG1.

1743
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:19,400
The runners-up was sorceress of Malbec and the scourge of Antharg.

1744
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,920
Those are much cooler names, because they have-

1745
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,800
I think I knew an ogre in a D&D game named Antharg.

1746
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,680
It's like they threw the alphabet into Will It Blend, and they got those names.

1747
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,080
Did you actually watch them for that?

1748
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,280
The sorceress of Elbec, what was that?

1749
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,280
Malbec.

1750
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,280
Malbec and the-

1751
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,280
And the scourge of Antharg.

1752
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,280
Antharg.

1753
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,060
Did you actually watch any of those yet?

1754
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:40,240
Will It Blend is pretty good, yes.

1755
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,560
I watched the one where they blended a Guitar Hero controller.

1756
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,760
I liked the one where they blended the iPhone.

1757
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
Pretty awesome.

1758
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,600
I heard they dispose of a hobo in that.

1759
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:58,200
April Fools, just kidding.

1760
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:04,440
Well there's a game that is on Xbox Live Arcade that everybody loves.

1761
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,360
And well, they're going to be loving the sequel too.

1762
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,480
It's Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2.

1763
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:16,060
And it is coming to Xbox Live Arcade, at least that's where we would assume it's going.

1764
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:22,240
And this comes to us from the Australian Classifications Board, the OFLC, which has just raided the

1765
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,240
game.

1766
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:31,200
So, you know, kind of like the MPA, not the MPAA, but the ESRB here, you know, that is

1767
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,660
kind of their version of that.

1768
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:37,760
So I'm sure, you know, we'll see this at some point, maybe an E3 announcement or something

1769
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,760
like that.

1770
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:41,840
Well when it got spoiled now though, that's got to suck.

1771
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,840
Eh, whatever.

1772
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,520
At least it's not like Sonic Unleashed.

1773
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:51,080
Yeah, that sucks for those guys.

1774
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,640
What do you think they're going to change in this game though?

1775
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,960
I kind of like the Wii version, the Wii version was good, I mean that would be a pretty kick-ass

1776
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,680
download game, but I mean, then again, it's the game that's on the Wii, so I don't think

1777
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,160
they could do the same thing.

1778
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,280
But like, I didn't know there was a lot else they could do to Geometry Wars, but that Wii

1779
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,280
game was pretty awesome.

1780
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,840
Add some new enemies maybe, or something like that, different weapons.

1781
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,840
I guess.

1782
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:16,320
Maybe they'll have like co-op or competitive mode or something, that would be a big change,

1783
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,200
because they didn't have that in the first one.

1784
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,240
So we'll see.

1785
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:29,680
Well we're going to play this song, and long time listeners of our show recognize that

1786
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:36,320
song as Happy Wedding, which is going to introduce a new segment in the show this week called

1787
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,200
Nerds Got Married.

1788
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,960
Whenever there's a wedding of note that we want to highlight on the show, we're going

1789
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,680
to say Nerds Got Married.

1790
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:49,600
So this week in Nerds Got Married, a listener of Orange Lounge Radio actually got married.

1791
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,360
The Viva Pinata guy, remember the Viva Pinata guy?

1792
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:56,160
He's actually a listener of the program, he commented on our MySpace.

1793
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,960
I think he was mad because we were poking fun at the story, even though that's what

1794
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,960
we do here.

1795
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:05,440
But the Viva Pinata guy got married.

1796
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:10,480
You might remember in Viva Pinata, he did the diamond sending thing and did a little

1797
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:17,440
note in the game, and they had the wedding, and they did it on a cruise ship, and they

1798
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,120
actually had little Viva Pinata creatures on their wedding cake.

1799
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:27,160
So congratulations to David and Jen, if you want to see more about the wedding.

1800
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:40,560
It's all on David's YouTube channel, which is available at Gears Cast.

1801
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,600
He must also be a big Gears of War player.

1802
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,600
So there you have it, Nerds Got Married.

1803
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,600
Congratulations.

1804
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:52,560
I know that song has to do with weddings and stuff, but do you have to use such a shitty

1805
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,560
song?

1806
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,960
I hate that song.

1807
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,280
I like to do little throwbacks to our days.

1808
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,280
It's a Bimani station.

1809
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,560
Could you do a better throwback?

1810
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,960
I could throw you out of here.

1811
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,920
I could throw my fist in your face.

1812
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:03,920
Alright.

1813
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,240
Just thought I'd interject there.

1814
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:06,240
Alright, how about this?

1815
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,040
I will allow Dark Soccer to do a proper throwback.

1816
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,040
Thank you.

1817
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:15,480
And she will throwback by highlighting a classic game of the week.

1818
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,960
It also hurts my heart because this is classic now.

1819
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,080
So Dark Soccer, what did you pick for the kids this week as your classic game of the

1820
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,080
week?

1821
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,080
Something they must check out?

1822
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,120
I picked Pure Awesomeness.

1823
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:33,600
I picked Crazy Taxi on Dreamcast.

1824
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Awesome.

1825
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,600
Yeah.

1826
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,920
This is the best, like one of the best games ever.

1827
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:43,800
Hey, it's time to make some crazy money, are you ready?

1828
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,520
Here we go!

1829
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,040
That's not the same song I remember.

1830
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,320
No, well, it had Bad Religion and Office of the Dead.

1831
01:17:53,320 --> 01:18:01,600
But yeah, it's basically, not only is it a clever type of beat the clock sort of driving

1832
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,600
game.

1833
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:10,040
You can do different kinds of stunts in there to increase your fare, you have to play for

1834
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:11,040
a better rating.

1835
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,880
I remember playing in the arcade until I got an S-Class license and I was so freaking happy.

1836
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:25,000
The game also is a clever advertising technique for Pizza Hut, Fila, Tower Records, which

1837
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,380
actually I guess it wasn't so clever for Tower Records, Levi's store, and Kentucky Fried

1838
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:30,380
Chicken.

1839
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:34,800
They all had massive product placement in that game.

1840
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,920
But you had four different drivers, you had your balance driver, you had your fast one,

1841
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:46,960
you've got your best control, and then you had your heavy cabs that can basically run

1842
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,960
over anything in its path.

1843
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,960
And you had a whole city set up that you could drive through and get in place, and jump out

1844
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,960
the buildings and do different things like that.

1845
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:02,960
And on top of that, as you can probably hear as I mentioned in the soundtrack, it had the

1846
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:07,960
songs from Bad Religion and Office of the Dead had interlock at 10 and 20 10, then the

1847
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:30,960
last song on the radio and not think of this game.

1848
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,080
I love this game, I actually think this is one of the better driving games.

1849
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,480
I'm not so fond of it on the Dreamcast as I am in the arcades, like for me that's the

1850
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,960
home for this game, it was an arcade game, although I will give props to the Dreamcast

1851
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,160
version because it had the missions and it had the extra stuff in it.

1852
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,160
The missions were hard though.

1853
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:52,880
The missions were actually pretty cool, if I'm just going to bring that up, it trains

1854
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,680
you to do different stuff in the game is what the missions are there for, so showing you

1855
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:04,200
how to do dashes and how to toby and crazy stuff, I actually thought the later ones that

1856
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,080
had so many interesting ones, like the super long jump and everything, that was kind of

1857
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,080
cool.

1858
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:12,080
But this is one of my favorite games ever.

1859
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,360
Irene, were you a fan of Crazy Taxi?

1860
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,360
I never played it.

1861
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,360
Really?

1862
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:17,360
Really.

1863
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
It's a really fun game actually.

1864
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,360
I should try.

1865
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,400
For a driving game it's a lot, it's just different, it's not just NASCAR vroom vroom vroom around

1866
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,400
in a circle, it's pretty fun.

1867
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,840
You raise the clock and get crazy money.

1868
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:30,720
Take people to Pizza Hut, how could you not like that?

1869
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,280
Yeah, I'll have to try it sometime.

1870
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:36,040
It's actually available on GameTap too, I know I hoard that a lot, but hey, they got

1871
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,040
free games on there.

1872
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,040
Well, not free, I guess free.

1873
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,760
I did like on the later ones though, I did like on the later ones how they had it where

1874
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,840
you could play, where you could have multiple people in your car too and do different deliveries

1875
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,260
to different places.

1876
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:52,680
Rasteel UT says, funny that Pizza Hut isn't Pizza Hut anymore, they're Pasta Hut now.

1877
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,320
Did they have to change that in later games or something maybe?

1878
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,800
Oh, in the game?

1879
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,800
I don't know.

1880
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:58,800
Maybe.

1881
01:20:58,800 --> 01:20:59,800
Wasn't that an April Fools joke?

1882
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,800
Yeah.

1883
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,800
Oh, perhaps.

1884
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,040
No, they're Wing Street now or whatever.

1885
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:10,640
Yeah, Tiger Claw mentions in the game you can't run over people sadly, any attempt they

1886
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,640
always run out of the way.

1887
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,640
Well, yeah.

1888
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,880
But it was sure fun trying.

1889
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,880
I'm talking about running into cars.

1890
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:16,880
Yeah.

1891
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,680
You can run into the cars.

1892
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:20,680
I love Crazy Taxi.

1893
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,680
I know, me too.

1894
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,680
I want to make some crazy money, Rob.

1895
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,680
All right.

1896
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,160
Well, I got a dollar.

1897
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,440
I owe you a dollar.

1898
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,440
You should just keep it.

1899
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,440
All right.

1900
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:35,680
Anyhow, that's going to do it for part A of our podcast, but there's plenty more to come

1901
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,240
for this, our last week on Live 365.

1902
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:43,120
Coming up in part B, we're going to play a game that we started here on Live 365.

1903
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:48,040
Actually, this game dates all the way back to a show I did on college radio, so this

1904
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,360
game has survived for 10 years.

1905
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,520
We're going to play it one last time... Well, not last time, but one more time tonight here

1906
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,240
on Live 365, and then we'll bring it over to All Games in a few weeks.

1907
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,960
We're going to play Listless tonight.

1908
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,600
The topic for tonight's Listless, so folks can start thinking about what they want to

1909
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:08,440
do here in studio, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

1910
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,440
Oh, God.

1911
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:15,520
This is the topic of tonight's Listless, things that Live 365 could do to get us to stay.

1912
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:20,200
You guys think about that, and we will cover that in part B of our podcast.

1913
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,560
But until then, a break.

1914
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,560
See you then.

1915
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:28,200
