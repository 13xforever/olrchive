Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco UK

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
Tonight, October 12, 2008, rumors about Blu-ray on 360 surface again, a next-gen Castlevania gets teased, and will YouTube soon sell you games?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
For the next few hours, we're going to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you for the next few hours, as will the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
I will be not joining everybody for the next few hours.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Where are you going, young lady?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Out of body.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Alright, well have fun and let us know how it goes.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Sure thing, Rob.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Where are you going to be visiting? Are you going to go to Disneyland and back?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yep.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Alright, have fun. Ride Space Mountain for me.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Woohoo.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
Alright, and also say hello to Tech Master, Loki, who's giggling like a schoolgirl, over here.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm not giggling like a schoolgirl.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Yes you are. I was doing the opening and I hear, he, like, it's not your hamburger that you're eating.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
No, Rob, that was the people that you hear in your head.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Apparently. Okay, great, you're going out of body.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
That was your voices.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
I have voices in my head. Loki is a schoolgirl?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Loki has a sandwich.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
I'm watching the game, because watching, because you can't actually play the game.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Right.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Don't shoot the puppy.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Wait, is your mic on? You're very, very quiet tonight for some reason.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I have no on-off button.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Oh, there you go. Well, you just weren't talking into it right.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Alright, sorry, go ahead. So don't shoot the puppy?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, don't shoot the puppy.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
The puppy walks, hops across the screen very happily, but it gets slower every level.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And you just keep getting, you know, it's a test of patience.

01:47.000 --> 01:54.000
And if you get frustrated and you push a button, it shoots the puppy with, like, this giant artillery cannon.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
This sounds terrible. Wait, this is a flash game or something?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Yes, it is.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
And that's the whole game. You just sit there. Can I see this?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Can I, can I? I know this is horrible radio, but can I?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
What the hell?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
What happened? Did you shoot the puppy?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Oh, no, I clicked the button and it's...

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
You'll just have to show me later. This is horrible radio.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
It's hilarious.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Apparently, Peeta has just joined our chat room and is currently protesting the show.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh, there we go.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Peeta's full of shit.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
Oh, it's a cute little stick figure puppy. Okay, sister. Aww.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Does it bark and stuff?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't have the sound on.

02:28.000 --> 02:36.000
This is coming from a website, rrrrthats5rs.com, even though there's only four.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Grrrr.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, so shoot it.

02:40.000 --> 02:48.000
Oh, that's terrible! At least it's only a cartoon, it's not like the real thing.

02:48.000 --> 02:55.000
So wait, again, the website? RRRR, that's five R's even though it's really only four.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Love that sense of humor, that's something else.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Anyhow, hey, you guys are joining us in chat.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Chat.orangelaunchy.com here live on this Sunday evening.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Ew! DJ Dysentery?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Yes, DJ Dysentery. I think DJ Dysentery's listened to the show before.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
I know, but that just makes me think of Pooh.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
DJ Dysentery's in chat and says, I don't think there's sound.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
So. So.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Alright, as Jamie complains about the climate in the Orange Lounge Radio Studio,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
it was warm in here earlier and now it's really cool and off fast.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Alright, enough about the weather, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
That's how we always start off the show, talking about some video games.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Dark Sakura, what have you played this week?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
I have disproven the old theory.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What theory is that?

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
That Airman can be defeated after all.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Because I played Mega Man 2.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Awesome.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yesterday.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Old school gaming on, right?

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Sure did.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
And I also have proven that I can no longer do the blindfold trick.

03:50.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh, you said, what level was it you could clear blindfolded?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Airman?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No. No, it was the dragon.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh, the wily dragon, that's right.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
The wily dragon.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Mm-hmm, okay.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Well, GS68, you're great.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
People for the unethical shit-talking of humans.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Puesto? I've never heard of that.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Puesto.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Anyway, Puesto.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
No, PETA is people eating tasty animals.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Alright, come on, enough PETA talk.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, PETA's full of shit anyway.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Alright.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
Well, but I played some Mega Man 2 and we actually were playing through Mega Man 9.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Dan and his buddy Jeff were.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
And there's some really annoying levels in that game.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
To a man's level is kind of annoying.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Is it weird to go back and visit Mega Man 2 after playing Mega Man 9?

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
Like, they actually have a lot in common, except 2 was a lot easier here in America.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Mega Man 2 had more drops.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
And if I'm correct, the difficult mode was the default mode for the Japanese version.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
It sure was.

04:49.000 --> 05:01.000
And another thing is that we were talking about the Mega Man 2 Anniversary Edition that came out on PlayStation and how it was a lot harder.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Because it was based off the Japanese one, if I remember right.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
No, it was harder than that.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
It was harder than that because we went through and played on difficult mode.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Oh, that's so wrong.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
What?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Sorry.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Don't shoot the puppy.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Sorry to go back to that again.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
But the game does get harder because there will be little pop-up ads that come up.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But they're all part of the game.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
And if you move the mouse or anything, it shoots the puppy.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So they're like, oh, I got to click that pop-up ad.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, dead.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
I love that.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I love that this show gets derailed so easily.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Go ahead.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Well, at any rate, we also tried a Proto Man mode.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And it's freaking kind of tough, too.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Because he takes double damage, but he has the shield.

05:44.000 --> 05:53.000
And it would be really hard to make it through the wily stages with Proto Man.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.000
Also, I've played Ragnarok.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Ragnarok.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Crack rock.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
All right.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
And I did homework.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
All right, so Mega Manorific.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I also watched the debate game, too.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Awesome.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
And voted.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
I voted this week.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Awesome.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
As everybody should.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
No matter who you support, you should go out and vote.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Because voting is important.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
And if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about the result.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Right?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
All right.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
It was all right.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I only really played a couple things.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Grand Theft Auto IV, as usual.

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
And I also played more Saints Row 2 because that game's awesome.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Now I'm finished with the Brotherhood storyline.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
And I'm starting the Sons of Samiti.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
And that's kind of interesting.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
And I tried to play some online deathmatch today, but it was hard to join the game.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
So I ended up quitting on that.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
And then I played a bit of Fable II.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
And got past the child stage and started your adult life.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And really got distracted with dancing in front of people.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
And then I got an achievement for it.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
And that's where I quit.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
So, yeah.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Awesome.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, you've been getting a sneak peek at a lot of early holiday games.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Because Fable II's not out for a couple weeks, right?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
That's right.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
And Saints Row II is out, what, this week?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Tuesday.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Finally?

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Well, at least you'll finally have some people to play multiplayer with.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Awesome.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
It'll be cool.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And keep finding new things to do in that game.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
It's awesome.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
So you didn't really spend a whole lot of time with Fable II, so you can't tell us a whole lot more about it.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Like, how does it compare to the first one?

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I never played the first one, so that I really can't tell you.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Gotcha.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
All right.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Well, let's see.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Moving on.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
My gaming week.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
You know, I've been playing a variety of stuff.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Pretty much the old stuff.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
You know, the old standbys.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Warcraft and so on.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
But I did check out a couple new games.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Beat and Groovy on Xbox Live Arcade.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
You know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're long-time music game fans.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, you know, the roots of our station, the name of the station, comes from old school music games.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And you actually see it show up in this game, Beat and Groovy.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Because one of the songs is by a group called Orange Lounge.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And that's kind of where the name of our radio station came from.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Well, I would usually encourage you to buy a game like Beat and Groovy.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But you know what, guys?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
It's just not that great.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
And I know that sounds horrible, because poppy music is a pretty awesome game franchise.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
But here's the problem.

08:26.000 --> 08:31.000
Is that they want to charge you $10 for 9 songs.

08:31.000 --> 08:38.000
And not only is it 9 songs, but it's 9 songs kind of thrown together that you have no choice to play with but the controller.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
You cannot remap the buttons in this game, which is very annoying.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Because two of the buttons use the control pad.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And actually, a third one kind of shares it too.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
I play the way where you use the D-pad for only 2.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
But you sometimes accidentally hit the third one if you kind of like flick the D-pad too fast.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So that sucks.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
Gosh, and here's the thing.

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Beat and Groovy would have been like the shit in 1998 on the Playstation 1.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
Because it's probably not that different from what the first release of poppy music was in Japan.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
So somebody up there at Konami of Japan is thinking,

09:18.000 --> 09:26.000
Oh, well if the first release of poppy music did well in Japan, we're going to mirror the first release of American poppy music off of it.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Even though we're not going to have a controller and put in some different songs.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
It just doesn't work.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I mean, there's so many just borked things about this game.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
And it's unfortunate because there's a good game in here somewhere.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
I know, I've seen it.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
I've seen the import versions of poppy music, which are some really fun music games.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
And it's a shame that now people who don't get music games,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
or people that think that Guitar Hero was the first music game ever made,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
or maybe like Frequency or Amplitude,

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
are going to think that this whole franchise is just total crap based off of this.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
I mean, A, you can't remap the controls.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
When you play online, you can only play online in three button mode.

10:00.000 --> 10:07.000
The hardest song is three notes on a scale of one to nine, basically.

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
So you know this game is built to just have microtransactions added on top of it.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
They're going to try to add new songs.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
They're going to try to add new difficulties and all this stuff.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.000
I really urge you guys, I don't think you should support this.

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
I mean, and it sounds horrible because I've always been a big supporter of Konami and the music game series,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
and I love DDR, and I love BeatMania 2DX.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh my god, I love BeatMania 2DX.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
But if this is what we're going to get, is these type of scraps, I reject it.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
And I don't think we should have to support it simply because it's pop and music,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
and simply because it's the game we want to see.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
And I'm sorry, I reject those calls that say we should buy this because then we might get this.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I'm sorry, no.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
We don't live in that day and age anymore.

10:50.000 --> 10:57.000
If Konami hasn't learned the lesson by now that Americans are willing to latch on to good music games,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
then they're just not going to get it.

10:59.000 --> 11:06.000
So I see no need to buy this game to somehow justify them to fix it and put out the game they should have in the first place.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
That being said, I did buy the game, but I felt some type of editorial obligation to because I don't get them for free,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
and I wanted to give you a fair impression here on the show.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
But again, this game is just so borked.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
By the way, the leaderboards, you would think the leaderboard scores would be like endless mode,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
or who got the highest score on this song.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
Nope, it's one leaderboard, and it's for online mode, and it's not even wins versus losses.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
It's a cumulative score.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
So in other words, the person who's ranked number one on the beat-and-groovy leaderboard

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
is just the person who's played the most matches online and gotten the highest score because of it.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
That's dumb.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
It's dumb.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
This game is borked in so many ways, and it's really, really sad.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I looked at video, and it made my heart break a little bit.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
There you go.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
So honestly, I mean, again, it's sad because I think there could have been a good game here,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
but for right now, if you want to play a decent music game on Xbox Live Arcade, just go get Boom Boom Rocket.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
It's the same concept.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
You mash buttons to things when they hit a line.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
It's a lot better looking.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
I wish I could say the music's better in Boom Boom Rocket,

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
but actually that would be the one thing that Pop'n Music has on the other game, Boom Boom Rocket,

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
is that the song list is slightly better, even if it is nine songs.

12:19.000 --> 12:27.000
There's some pretty good songs in it, like Moon and Star Mine and the Earth whatever song that sounds like the...

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah, that song's pretty cool too.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Hey, Rob.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
What?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
We should go to my house and play Pop'n Music.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
We should.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
I mean, honestly, if you want to play a great music game that's like Beat'n Groovy,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
go import Pop'n Music. Seriously.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I really, really, really want an arcade-style controller.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Yeah, they are fun. I had a friend that had one.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
They're fun.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
It's just kind of weird that they would release this game with no controller here.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
I know.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
It makes no sense because, I mean, have you ever tried to play Pop'n Music on the PlayStation controller?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
It's freaking hard.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Although it is kind of fun to try it on the 2DX controller.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
Now, our buddy Bobby Black Wolf actually did this pretty awesome YouTube that compares Beat'n Groovy to Pop'n Music 13.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
The note charts are the exact same, which is fine.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
I understand that.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
I mean, I don't hold that against them except for the fact that sometimes you have the purple and the blue notes come up back to back,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
and when you have to use a control pad for both of those, it makes it hard.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
You can't hit two on the control pad at the same time, and you can kind of do upper left, but it's mixed results at best.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
And what if you have the purple and the orange?

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, I guess you can hit one with the Y, but still, it just, bleh.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Doesn't work.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
You need to be able to remap the buttons.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
This game has just too many bugs in it.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
They need to go back to the drawing board.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
That's really it as far as new games.

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
I did play Feeding Frenzy 2, which reminded me, of course, a lot of the first one with some different bonuses,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
but I didn't play it enough to give it a full review.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
But I did enjoy myself.

13:54.000 --> 14:03.000
I enjoyed myself in probably the ten minutes I played Feeding Frenzy 2 more than I did probably the hour I spent with Beat'n Groovy just having a cry.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
I forgot to mention with Saints Row 2.

14:05.000 --> 14:12.000
All the cheat codes leaked online, including those wonderful exclusive codes that GameStop had if you pre-ordered the game.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
No to anyone buying anything from GameStop.

14:14.000 --> 14:21.000
If it has a code involved with it, and it's not actually a Microsoft code where you download something off of their service, it's going to leak out immediately.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
And that's fun.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
They have the Evil Cars code in there.

14:25.000 --> 14:34.000
They have a code to get, like, a pocket bike, and then you can do a code to make yourself even larger so it looks like you're just sitting down and driving that way.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Super explosions, yeah.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Reading some comments from chatroom about Beat'n Groovy.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
GS68 says, when if I somehow get a job over the winter, I'll use the monies for a desktop arcade and one of the CS releases.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, that'll probably be a better investment.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
DJ Dysentery says, well, props for Starmine at least.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
I agree, it does seem like they kind of tried to throw us a bone or two on the song list.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
They gave us some really cool songs.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
But, yeah.

14:58.000 --> 15:07.000
Well, did you notice that the game, I mean, I didn't even play it at all, but just from the videos, the game has, like, this urban vibe to it, and then there's Super Eurobeat in there.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It's like, huh?

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
Well, it's, you know what, this game wasn't, it's weird, because I feel like this game wasn't really made for America, even though it came out here.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
It definitely caters to the Japanese style.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
SSJ100Matt says, it tried to be like Boom Boom Rocket, except it wasn't fun.

15:24.000 --> 15:32.000
That's kind of the whole thing, though, is that it wasn't trying to be Boom Boom Rocket, because this game's been out for years and years before Boom Boom Rocket.

15:32.000 --> 15:40.000
It's just that, unfortunately, that's the impression most people are going to have of this game, because of the fact that it's lackluster in many, many departments.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
And it pains me to say that.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
I know there is a great game in there somewhere.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I've played pop music 11, 12, 10, 8.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I've played tons of pop music games.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It's way fun, especially with that giant controller.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
This, not fun.

15:53.000 --> 16:05.000
I wonder if they just, you know, said, hey, you know, let's just go ahead and have a company make pop music for us for the 360 and Xbox Live Arcade.

16:05.000 --> 16:11.000
And they get it back and they're like, crap, this sucks, let's call it Beaten Groovy instead, because we don't want to tarnish the pop music name.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
I think the first half of what you said is spot on.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I think this game was to outsource for completion.

16:16.000 --> 16:23.000
And I think whoever was in charge of some of the decisions needs to be whipped with a wet noodle.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
That's all.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Anyhow.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
What if it, though, is testing the waters?

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Then they failed.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
For potential release.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
That's what fucking bugs me about Konami of Japan, is that they shouldn't have to.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
If you want to see if a music game is going to do good here in America, fucking look at Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
If they're not going to, God, it just makes me angry how fucking dense they are in not understanding the music.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
I mean, they have a fucking cult based around these music games here in America.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
And they just, they turn a blind eye to it all the time and release crap like this.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Well, it worked in Japan, so it must work in America.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Ten years ago it worked in Japan.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Times have changed.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
The bar has been risen.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
Wake up, Konami of Japan.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Wake up.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Rob for president.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Twelve.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
No, I'm kidding.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
F that.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Make me CEO of Konami.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
I'll go change some things real quick.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Alright.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Anyhow.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Let's move on.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Sorry, GS68, the FUs are not coming up next.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
We have those, believe me, there's other things to piss you off later in the show.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Alright, look, we've got to get into gaming news.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Let's talk about housekeeping a little bit.

17:34.000 --> 17:40.000
First off, for those listening live tonight, last week's show archive never got put up because I'm slow.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And I got very busy this week, so I apologize.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
Folks that are listening to this on the podcast, you will have already seen 297 finally fall in probably tonight or Monday at the absolute latest.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
And 298 should be right up on Tuesday or Wednesday.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
So I apologize for the delay.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
But it happens.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Life gets in the way.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
We're not the only podcast that sometimes gets a little slow, so sorry about that.

18:00.000 --> 18:05.000
Always, there is our live journal and MySpace and Facebook that we like to plug as well.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Live Journal, Orange Lounge.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
And Facebook, OL Army.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Be sure to add us on those various sites.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
And Twitter now as well, OLR.

18:13.000 --> 18:22.000
And we'll get to the pre-show OLR Twit question in just a little bit when we start talking about Tokyo Game Show, which I'm sure we're going to get to during the news report.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
But first, some news out of the Tokyo Game Show that I'm kind of surprised wasn't announced here in America, right, Loki?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Exactly.

18:28.000 --> 18:37.000
I think, well, really the last US Microsoft press conference that they had was pretty much at, well, I guess I could have done one at PAX.

18:37.000 --> 18:48.000
But it was pretty much at E3, and of course this game was rumored to have been about to be announced at E3, but for whatever reason they stopped it.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
So they left it for Tokyo Game Show, and of course that game is Halo 3 Recon.

18:53.000 --> 19:01.000
It's the one that they were teasing with the Bungie little viral video thing that they released, a brand new teaser trailer.

19:01.000 --> 19:07.000
And Halo 3 Recon will be a standalone game, includes new multiplayer maps.

19:07.000 --> 19:17.000
It takes place before Halo 3, and actually it's a totally different style of a game.

19:17.000 --> 19:26.000
Of course you're not exactly one of the Spartan soldiers, so one or two hits and you're pretty much going to be dead.

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
And I think it sounds more of like a stealthy game since you're kind of, you know, recon.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
And, I don't know, it looks kind of neat.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
They announced it's going to be coming out in the fall of 2009.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
That's kind of surprising because I thought it was supposed to be coming out in the spring, or at least it would have made more sense to come out in the spring, I think.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
But, I don't know.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
So I guess this is the next big Halo game that we're going to be getting.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Do you think it's going to do as well as Halo 3?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
I don't think so.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
Halo 3 was, I think it was one of those games where the hype really killed it.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
I mean like Halo 3, I think if it didn't have all that hype behind it, would have been pretty well received.

20:03.000 --> 20:09.000
But I think a lot of people grew tired of it really fast because there was so much hype around it and how it was just going to be so much better than Halo 2.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
And then it was like, eh, it's Halo 2 but prettier.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
I don't think this is going to do as well because I think it's running off the same engine.

20:15.000 --> 20:26.000
And also the fact that unless you're a really big Halo fan, I don't know really if you're going to enjoy much of the prologue to the whole Halo 3 stuff.

20:26.000 --> 20:37.000
I mean, to me, I played through Halo and I sort of know what was going on and I don't know, this doesn't seem that interesting to me.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
Let me go on a side little adventure here and I want to talk about a story that somehow shockingly did not make tonight's show roll.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
I just scrolled through to make sure it wouldn't come up later.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
But you know, BlizzCon was also going on this week.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.000
One of the big things that came out of BlizzCon was that Starcraft 2 is actually kind of getting split into three different games.

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
They're going to have like one game surrounding each of the different races inside Star Trek and that was some of the big news that hit the internet this week.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
And a lot of people were like, rabble, rabble, rabble.

21:02.000 --> 21:10.000
I can't believe they're going to make us pay three full games for, you know, it's one game for the price of three and blah, blah, I'm getting shafted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
And I kind of look in the story about Halo 3 Recon and I'm going, well is this much different?

21:15.000 --> 21:20.000
It is different because they've already had a full campaign for, you know, Halo 3.

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
This is a brand new story that takes place in, you know, a different time in the series.

21:25.000 --> 21:32.000
Well, but Starcraft 2 is going to have that full multiplayer which is what everybody plays anyway and it's going to have a fleshed out single player story mode.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
I mean, they're just kind of approaching it a different way.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
Not that I'm totally defending what Blizzard's doing, but I don't see how you can say boo to that and then go, yay, another Halo 3.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
I still think it's cheap though. I mean, look at like Red Alert. There's a perfect example.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
The game has a few different factions and there's a storyline for each one.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
Well, you know, other games have done it. They have, you know, multiple sides and they have multiple storylines.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
But Halo 2's single player mode was also done like that.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So it's Halo 3.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Right, they're slightly lackluster.

22:04.000 --> 22:10.000
The thing is, I think this should be download content. If it's going to be running off the same engine, just have it as a downloadable game, not this retail thing.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
Because now if it's retail, we can charge, you know, $59.99 for it.

22:14.000 --> 22:19.000
A lot more than you can charge for an Xbox, you know, expansion or something like that.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
So, I don't know. It's just...

22:22.000 --> 22:31.000
By the time, I guess, Halo's going to be coming out, you know, Halo 3, by the time, you know, this new game comes out, Halo 3 will probably be like $29.99.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
I wouldn't be surprised if they do, like, a game of the year edition or something like that or, you know...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Eventually it'll be combined.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
They're going to combine them.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Yeah, I know.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
And, you know, we need one more game because, you know, what game...

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
We need a trilogy to complete the trilogy.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
Exactly. Exactly. You know, who doesn't want three of something?

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
It all comes in threes, right?

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
I was very curious to see what our chat room would say in response to this.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
The Rob D says, the difference is that there's a precedent in strategy games for putting a different campaign in for each faction.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
In FPS games, there's always been an expansion pack for a new campaign.

23:08.000 --> 23:15.000
If Halo 1 had different campaigns that were all free and Halo 2 didn't, people would be complaining about it just like they are about StarCraft.

23:15.000 --> 23:18.000
It's not even just two purchases. It's three purchases, triple the cost.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
Act F says it's basically what I said last week with the ACDC track pack.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
SSJ100Matt says people are suckers, especially for Blizzard games.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
And, uh, let's see, um...

23:31.000 --> 23:36.000
It would be different if they had, like, you know, a storyline for all of them, like a campaign,

23:36.000 --> 23:42.000
and then later on they added a new expansion that had more storyline for all the campaigns or something like that.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Break it up like that and have expansions.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
I just kind of think people are passing judgement on the StarCraft 2 thing too quickly without really seeing what each individual game has to offer.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
They're only looking at it at face value, going, oh, three different games? What? What?

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
And then I'm just going, well, how is that different from most, you know?

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
And Rob D brings up a good point, like FPSs have kind of done this for a long time.

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
Look at, uh, go back to the days of Shareware and, um, Quake.

24:08.000 --> 24:14.000
Quake had, like, what, four different episodes? The first one was free, but you had to pay for each of the other ones individually.

24:14.000 --> 24:21.000
But all the other four, um, or the other three campaigns that were in there were part of the retail version.

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
Shareware, it's just the same as saying, okay, you get one level in this demo and then you get the other ten when you buy the full game.

24:28.000 --> 24:33.000
It's not, it's not an excuse for just adding this as its own thing.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
Or, well, I'm just saying for StarCraft, that's just, I'm sorry, that's to get more money.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
The whole thing is probably, oh, our game's going to be pirated to hell, so we need to sell more copies.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
How do we sell more copies? We split it up into three.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
Because it's not a storage issue. It's not a time issue. I can tell you right now that these are probably not going to be very fleshed out.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
I mean, what can, how long can a strategy campaign last for?

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
I mean, not very long, so, great. Let's just do one for each specific thing.

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
You know, if you want to do something different, just do, like, you know, different packaging, you know, with different sides on it or something like that.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
You know, collector's editions type stuff. I'm taking a wait and see approach.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.000
I mean, you know, if games can be compared to movies, sometimes movies are released in three different parts.

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
And, you know, we still go see all three of them, like the Star Wars trilogy, the new one.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
Matrix trilogy, even though that is questionable about its, you know, value.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
But, you know, we'll pay three times to see the full movie.

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
But it's a full movie. It's not like I'm watching, you know, like a Batman movie.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
And one of the movies is from the perspective of Batman.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
Do you not think Starcraft 2 is not going to be a full game?

25:47.000 --> 25:52.000
I don't think. Well, the way it sounds like now, I don't think each one's going to be a full game.

25:52.000 --> 26:00.000
They're going to call them a full game, and it'll be a full campaign for one side, but it's going to feel kind of cheap because, you know, what's the other stuff?

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
So, say, what if I'm playing, you know, the first one and I want to play the campaign for something else?

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
Oh, I can't do that now. Sorry, you've got to go buy the other one.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
All right, well, if you want to give us a comment on that, you can always send us an email.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or you can call us a little later on in the program.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
For now, though, we'll move on to some more gaming news, talking about 360 and some holiday bundles that are coming out.

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Hooray! Free games now coming with your Xboxes.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Wait, wait, wait. This is totally new news.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
I know. Never heard this one before. Well, it has been confirmed, okay, that there is now a 199 arcade holiday bundle.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
And with it, you will get Sega Superstars Tennis and five Xbox Live arcade games that have not yet been announced.

26:41.000 --> 26:49.000
Well, actually, I think the arcade games, they've been actually changing a little bit because I remember when I first bought an arcade to replace my broken system.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
There was, you know, a bunch of games with it now.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
I actually got a new arcade system for my sister for her birthday and it had slightly different stuff.

26:56.000 --> 27:07.000
Like, they had Boom Boom Rocket in there, there was Pac-Man Championship Edition, Luxor 2, Feeding Frenzy, and...

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
A sampling. A sampling of some of the newer stuff.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same thing.

27:10.000 --> 27:16.000
In fact, I would say it's exactly the same thing because for the people that don't have the bundles or haven't purchased them,

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
they get a disc that goes in, or they get those two free games that go in there and they put them in and then put the sticker on the box.

27:21.000 --> 27:29.000
All right, well, if you want to jump up and get the 299 or 399 levels, that would be for the, what I just called the normal Xbox 360.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
The pro and the elite.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
I know it's the pro, but that's the one that most people are probably getting is the pro.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
The hardcore gamer gets the elite, the person who doesn't know better and just wants the cheapest one gets the arcade.

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
The normal Xbox 360 is 299, or the elite for 399.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
You get Lego, Indiana Jones, and Kung Fu Panda for free.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
Probably those titles were selected because they're both rated E for everyone and they, you know, it's the holidays.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
They're pushing the family games.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
They want to push this as a family system because that's one area where the Xbox 360s always seem to lack.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
And to be fair, those games are actually pretty good.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Yeah, especially the Lego one is good.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
Well, even Kung Fu Panda was actually rated pretty good and it wasn't that cheap. It wasn't like a cheap movie game.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
All right, well, there you have it.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Hey, one more comment on the last story because some of the, you know, because of the delay between when we say something and when it goes out to the stream on all games radio,

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
which is just inevitable with internet radio or even over the area radio,

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
reading a comment from Retertainment from the last story about Blizzard and we kind of got in that little disagreement there.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
All companies want to make as much money as humanly possible.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
Blizzard thinks they can make mad bucks on this deal, so they are going to go through with it.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
If the community says in mass that this is not the case, they will change their plans.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
But the community won't.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
You know it. I know it.

28:38.000 --> 28:47.000
Yeah, just like the community bitched and moaned, well, I should say a few individuals bitched and moaned about the Diablo 3 art style and we got a t-shirt out of it at least.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
We'll see.

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
All right, so anyhow, yeah, so if you haven't gotten your Xbox 360 yet, you might want to wait until those package deals show up because, hey, free games!

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
It's hard to complain about free games. That's more than I got.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
They should be out there now, I think.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
That's more than I got when I got my Xbox 360.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
Well, how about something that makes me super excited about the Xbox 360?

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
Barbie Horse Princess, part 2.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
They're making a babysitting game in there?

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
To quote Patty from Twitter earlier, Diana Né Pompeire.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
No.

29:21.000 --> 29:26.000
Tekken 6 is going to be out on the Xbox 360 in Fall 2009.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.000
That makes me super happy.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Super, super happy.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Because then I don't have to get it on PlayStation 3.

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
But, I don't know, I might get it on PlayStation 3, but I love Tekken.

29:37.000 --> 29:44.000
I am the world's biggest Tekken fangirl, and according to Microsoft, it's going to be out on Fall 2009.

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
You know, and I don't know if it was ever announced that it was an exclusive, but that's one less exclusive that they get.

29:49.000 --> 30:04.000
It was considered to be before PS3 exclusive, especially given that one of the demos for the PlayStation 3 was actually renderings of Jin from the Tekken series.

30:04.000 --> 30:12.000
So, this was actually confirmed at the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2008 press conference for Namco Bandai.

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
I'm kind of curious, as a Tekken fangirl, how you feel about this announcement about Tekken going by.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.000
And by by, I mean, of course, by system all.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
Because, you know, I had another friend of mine who was pretty into Tekken who was like,

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
wow, that is big news for Tekken to not come out on a Sony system only.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
That's huge.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
No, it is. I agree.

30:31.000 --> 30:41.000
In fact, in the past, as far as I'm aware, every American Tekken release has been out on a Sony system.

30:41.000 --> 30:49.000
There has been a Tekken card fighter game that came out in Japan on Wonderswan.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
But then again, that's Bandai's system.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
We don't count the spin-offs.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Then we'd have to count Death by Degrees and no one wants to remember that game.

30:57.000 --> 31:04.000
But then again, that's also in the Tekken franchise and it did only come out for PlayStation 2, right?

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
True.

31:05.000 --> 31:13.000
So I do believe, if I'm correct, there's only ever been one Tekken game that came out on a non-Sony system.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
And that was the Wonderswan.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
But then again, a lot of Sony franchises did come out on the Wonderswan.

31:19.000 --> 31:30.000
So for them to give that much of a nod to the Xbox 360, I think is very, very big.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Some of the chatters just want to throw this out there.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
AlphaKananagram and Hitstun want to remind you, there was Tekken Advance on Game Boy Advance.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
That's right. That was the other one I was trying to think of. I actually do have that one too.

31:39.000 --> 31:48.000
So out of, let's see, five games tagged tournament, there were only two other games that came out.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.000
Dark Resurrection came out on-

31:49.000 --> 31:54.000
And they weren't, I mean, with all due respect, these other two games weren't real Tekken games, quote-unquote.

31:54.000 --> 32:00.000
These other ones we're thinking of are arcade, ports, the base Tekken series.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
We don't count these other ones.

32:01.000 --> 32:07.000
Dark Resurrection, though, was an actual Tekken game, but that came out on PSP.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
I was going to read a comment from chat.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
Tigerclaw on chat says, you know, Namco has pretty much slapped Sony in the face by becoming multiplatform.

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
Tekken has been a PlayStation exclusive since day one.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
That pretty much was it.

32:21.000 --> 32:30.000
Especially when you had all your PlayStation releases have the compatibility with each other to go back and look at your movies and everything.

32:30.000 --> 32:38.000
I just, I really do think that it's a really big deal.

32:38.000 --> 32:46.000
On top of that, I think it's also going to be, I'm not calling it a nail in the coffin for Sony,

32:46.000 --> 32:53.000
but I think it's definitely a major wake-up call that they're not doing something right.

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
They had been doing right when the PlayStation came out.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
They had been doing right when the PS2 came out. Am I right?

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
Absolutely. Those are both fantastic systems.

33:02.000 --> 33:08.000
As far as their sales went, their marketing strategy, as far as them coming out over the top of the competition,

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
and now they're sliding, now they're falling into, sorry, they're falling into the Sega Pit.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.000
Well, it's interesting, though, because here in America, you know, that's kind of the general perception.

33:19.000 --> 33:25.000
I mean, granted, there's Sony fanboys, there's my, you know, every console will always have its fanboys until the end of time.

33:25.000 --> 33:30.000
However, but in Japan, I'm kind of looking at this and going, is this really going to make a difference in Japan?

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
I mean, I don't see this moving Xbox 360s in Japan suddenly.

33:34.000 --> 33:41.000
I just don't see this, you know, in my mind, this is more of a, hey, let's get Tekken 6 to more people in America.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.000
I don't think this is going to mean a hill of beans in Japan. I think most people will still get it for PS3.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Keep in mind, though, the Saturn did very well in Japan.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
True.

33:49.000 --> 33:54.000
And the Saturn did not do well over here because of marketing.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.000
They didn't bring out the games that the fans were interested in.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
They didn't market the system properly.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
And now that's happening with the PS3 over here.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
They're basically pulling a Sega.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
They're trying to rest on, oh, well, we had this system back in the day.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah, but what do you have now?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
The Dreamcast was fantastic, don't get me wrong.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
The Saturn to this day is one of my favorite gaming systems.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
But did they have the right support over here?

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
No.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And what's happening to the PlayStation 3 now?

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
It's losing its support.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
They're not doing something right.

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
Well, the PlayStation 3 is always going to be a Blu-ray player that plays games.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
That's what I agree.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
This will not put Sony out of business.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
There will be a PS4, but we just kind of hope they, you know...

34:36.000 --> 34:45.000
If they do a PS4, I think the PS4, they're going to have to turn some shit around before they can actually make it anything that's viable for their company to bring out.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Else they're just going to have to go back to making TVs.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
All right.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
We're getting a little too much into the whole console war now.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
And yes, GS68 bless you for SEGA Sanchiro.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
SEGA Sanchiro was awesome.

35:00.000 --> 35:05.000
Let's move on. Let's go back to some more gaming news that I think will also make a lot of folks happy.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
Yeah. Well, you know, of course there are many games coming to both consoles out there.

35:11.000 --> 35:23.000
But one date that they did announce was the release of the brand new Resident Evil 5 that will be coming to consoles March 12th.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
And, of course, that will be coming to the 360 and on the PS3.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
And it's all sorts of awesome.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.000
It's like Resident Evil 4 HD.

35:35.000 --> 35:41.000
I don't know. This game looks freaking sweet to me. I'm excited about Resident Evil 5.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
And I barely even played Resident Evil 4.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.000
Well, no, I actually spent quite a bit of time on Resident Evil 4. It was a tremendous game.

35:47.000 --> 35:51.000
But I'm just excited about the whole, like, you know, high def and scary scary and all that good stuff.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
It's pretty good. And now they have co-op, so that's awesome.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
Well, another sequel that's making a lot of people go, huh, is 99 Nights 2.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
That's right. It was confirmed at the Tokyo Game Show that 99 Nights 2 is coming to the Xbox 360.

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
But as far as when and how much and what's new about it, nope, no information on that yet.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Just the fact it is coming.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
I know a lot of people like to hate on 99 Nights. I didn't think the game was awful.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
Like, it's kind of how I feel about Beat and Groovy in some ways.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
No, actually, I don't know. I have that same feeling of 99 Nights, there's a good game in there somewhere,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
but there were just a few flaws that kind of kept it from being great.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
Well, look at, like, Dynasty Warriors. Why does that game sell?

36:31.000 --> 36:38.000
I mean, they literally, seriously, they put out three different versions of pretty much the same game

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
each time that there's a new release.

36:40.000 --> 36:46.000
You have Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Empires, and Dynasty Warriors,

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
God, I remember the XL or something like that, Extreme Legends.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
And they're all practically the same.

36:54.000 --> 37:00.000
I mean, I don't really play the series too much, but your average consumer is going to look at all three of those

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
and go, I don't get it. What's the difference?

37:03.000 --> 37:08.000
And really, that's kind of like, with this game, it's basically like a Dynasty Warriors clone,

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
so the next one comes out, I'm not expecting they're going to change much, hopefully fix some things, and that's it.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.000
Well, you know, they only need to fix a few more things for this game to actually be pretty kick-ass.

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
I enjoy myself. I like the game.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
Rama says, Sky, don't you have 99 Nights? I do. I bought it the day it came out.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
But I'm also, you have to remember, I'm also a whore for Q Entertainment.

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
I mean, seriously, anything Mizuguchi does, I'm going to buy, because he's one of my favorite game designers,

37:32.000 --> 37:36.000
except Gun Pay. I never got Gun Pay for some reason, but it's on my list.

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
Can you imagine how awesome Beat and Groovy would have been if Q Entertainment had made it?

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
I think Q Entertainment should make a game done right, anyway.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
Anyway, that's for another day.

37:47.000 --> 37:53.000
But 99 Nights, you know, obviously 99 Nights, as much as I want to say, it's not as bad as you all think.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
Okay, definitely the game had its flaws. It did get boring after a while.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
I just hope they can fix some of it with 99 Nights, too.

37:59.000 --> 38:03.000
There's a good game in there somewhere, and I hope people don't totally pass it off on name alone,

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
because, hey, sometimes games don't get really, really good until the sequel.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
For instance, Mega Man.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
A lot of people don't remember Mega Man until Mega Man 2.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
It's not to say the first Mega Man was bad. It was just, you know, just needed a few tweaks,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
and then Mega Man 2 was awesome.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
Of course, then again, I wouldn't even compare Mega Man to 99 Nights,

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
so I don't know where the fuck I'm going with that analogy.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
So why don't we go on to the next story?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
I don't know where the fuck you're going with that analogy, Rob.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
I don't either. I'm obviously drunk.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
So how about something else?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
How about it?

38:33.000 --> 38:41.000
Well, you know there had been some rumors about there potentially being a Blu-ray drive on the Xbox 360?

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Every week there's some damn rumor about it, yes.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Well, here is the official word.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Dun dun dun.

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
This is a quote from one of Microsoft's representatives.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
It says,

38:54.000 --> 39:00.000
As we've said before, Microsoft has no plans to introduce an Xbox 360 Blu-ray add-on.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
Games are what drive consumers to purchase game consoles,

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
and we remain focused on providing the largest library of blockbuster games available.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
And that's a direct quote.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
Allow me to translate to all the bloggers around America and throughout the world, really.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
I want to provide my translation.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Oh, please. Go ahead.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Shut the fuck up!

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
That's exactly what I was going to say.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
Shut the fuck up about the Blu-ray on Microsoft.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
It is not happening.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
And if it is going to happen, we'll fucking tell you a long time from now,

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
because it's just not something we're interested in right now.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
The whole thing that brought that up was that there had been a rumor that Microsoft had commissioned

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
the hardware to be made with a Toshiba Samsung.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
But, no.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
And you want to know what?

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
I love my HD DVD player on it.

39:45.000 --> 39:51.000
But, going back to what I was previously saying about what Sony is doing wrong,

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
I think that's what Sony's doing wrong.

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
They're not focusing on the games, and that's what Microsoft is doing right.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Well, but is that necessarily a bad thing?

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
Because I look at the PSP and I go, eh, not my favorite gaming system first,

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
but the PSP does a lot of cool shit that I like.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
It's kind of like an all-in-one little device.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
I can name people off the top of my head who've bought the PSP not as a gaming system,

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
but as a multimedia system.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Exactly.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
But when I think handheld game system, I think of my DS.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.000
But what's so wrong with the PlayStation 3 taking that same kind of concept about being a home entertainment device?

40:26.000 --> 40:32.000
Because when someone's going to buy a console, it is going to be because they can play games on it.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
That is, I think, the end all of what a video game console is.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
It can have all these nice pretty special bells and whistles,

40:40.000 --> 40:45.000
but in the end, no matter what, what do we always say?

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
The console is only as good as the games that are on it.

40:48.000 --> 40:54.000
If they're not putting good games on it, what good is the damn console other than, you know, just playing a movie?

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
I know somebody who owns a PlayStation 3 for nothing but Blu-ray.

40:59.000 --> 41:03.000
They don't own a single video game, just the Blu-ray player, because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
So it's like, what's the point?

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
You can buy Blu-ray players.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
One other thing I kind of want to point out, you know,

41:11.000 --> 41:17.000
Microsoft has a high-definition movie download service, and they're rolling out Netflix pretty soon.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Do they really want a Blu-ray player? Probably not.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
They probably want to go to this whole digital distribution thing, because there's a lot of money to be made there.

41:24.000 --> 41:31.000
I think that's where it's going. I really do think that that's the future of our media, you know.

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised that ten years down the line, you'll have a hard time picking up physical media.

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
It's all going to be downloadable content.

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
All right, well, there you have it. No Blu-ray, so you just stop spreading rumors about it. Shut up. Please.

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
Meantime, though, we've got a lot of other releases coming out that are confirmed and will be happening, right, Loki?

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Yes, there's plenty of stuff coming out, because we're now in the fourth quarter,

41:55.000 --> 41:59.000
which is where all the game companies like to hide their games.

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
And starting off, and of course there's a lot of crap out there,

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune for the Wii looks like a piece of shit,

42:08.000 --> 42:12.000
and Avatar The Last... Please, tell us how you really feel.

42:12.000 --> 42:17.000
Well, okay, let me put it this way. It's by a company called Zoo Games, and all their games have sucked.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
Avatar The Last Airbender Into the Inferno.

42:21.000 --> 42:27.000
Hopefully the achievements take a little longer to get than, say, the last game where you could get them all in about five minutes.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
And that'll be out on the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
Blitz League 2 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.

42:36.000 --> 42:42.000
TAC The Guardians of Gross on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

42:42.000 --> 42:47.000
And of course another TAC game for the DS, Mojo Mistake.

42:47.000 --> 42:54.000
Bratz Girls Really Rock coming to the Wii and DS and PlayStation 2.

42:54.000 --> 43:03.000
We've got, let's see, Pray the Stars, which apparently didn't come out last week.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
That is on the DS.

43:06.000 --> 43:12.000
Rob Dine, that's available on all platforms.

43:12.000 --> 43:20.000
Resuscitate the Radio Host. I'm okay, I just drank... Oh god, no, I'm gonna choke again.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
Shitty radio, keep reading dates.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
Littlest Pet Shop. They are putting out a ton of these because apparently they think they are Nintendogs.

43:28.000 --> 43:33.000
Littlest Pet Shop Winter, Littlest Pet Shop Garden, and Littlest Pet Shop.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
I know there's one more. Those are all coming out.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
The Littlest Pet Shop on the Wii and the rest on the DS.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
Poker for Dummies on PC. Brain Training for Dummies on PC.

43:47.000 --> 43:52.000
My Japanese Coach on DS. That's one I'm actually looking forward to checking out.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
And let's see, SOCOM Confrontation coming out this week.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
You can get that by itself and with the headset or download it on the PlayStation Network.

44:03.000 --> 44:10.000
Saints Row 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Highly recommend checking that out.

44:10.000 --> 44:17.000
Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer on the DS, if you happen to own a dog.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.000
And you like to talk to dogs.

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
I like to talk to dogs. Get off me, dog!

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Do they talk back?

44:25.000 --> 44:29.000
Only when I'm high.

44:29.000 --> 44:36.000
Penny Racer's Party Turbo Q Speedway, that's the localization of Qoro Q.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
Wait, what? That's a Qoro Q game?

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
Yes, it's a Qoro Q game.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Sweet!

44:43.000 --> 44:48.000
Tenpin Alley 2 coming out on the Wii. Another bowling game.

44:48.000 --> 44:56.000
And, let's see, Rock Revolution on the DS this week.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Oh, goody goody!

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
Golden Axe Beast Rider on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

45:02.000 --> 45:08.000
Oh, and Rock Revolution will be coming out also, I believe the game only version, on all platforms except for the Wii.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
I don't know why the Wii got delayed. Probably not done yet, making a crappy game.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
Dokapon Kingdom on Wii and PlayStation 2, the party game where you're supposed to lose your friends.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
And FIFA Soccer 09 is coming out on all platforms.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
Sam & Max Season 1 finally coming out on the Wii.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
A little late there.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Dead Space coming out on PlayStation 2.

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
Yeah, but it's a way to expose it to a whole new audience that probably missed it on the PC.

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
Dead Space coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Lots of stuff.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
I actually think I want to get Rock Revolution. I don't know why.

45:48.000 --> 45:58.000
I don't know, I feel like after buying Beat & Groovy this week, I just need to kind of complete my Konami the year the music games died for us trifecta.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
Save your money, please.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
I don't know.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
Please, I urge you.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I think I'm going to get it.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
One of us has to do it. For the sake of reporting on it for the show, someone's got to take the plunge.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
I will take care of the game, but please.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
Anyways, Safecracker coming to the Wii.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
Let's see here, Hot Dish for PC.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Well, Hot Dish!

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
SpongeBob SquarePants, The Game of Life for the PC.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Wow, digging at the bottom of the barrel here.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
Enchanted Fairy Friends, Secret Fairy.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
And, damn, there's still more stuff coming out.

46:42.000 --> 46:46.000
Cake Mania, Baker's Challenge on PSP.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
World of Goo coming out on PC.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
Not one person who listens to this show gives a shit about Cake Mania on the PSP.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
Hey, it's a casual game, okay? Seriously.

46:55.000 --> 46:59.000
It's popular, it's online, and then finally this might be a game you're interested in.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Rock Band 2 coming out.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
Both the special edition bundles on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and the game only on PlayStation 3.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
There we go.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
A week from today.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
There we go.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
Saving the best for last.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
And that is your gaming week.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
How about Japan?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
How about them?

47:16.000 --> 47:19.000
How about them? How you doing over in Japan?

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
Xbox 360, you have Facebreaker to look forward to this week on the 16th.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
That's that boxing game that looks kind of funny, right?

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I don't know much about this game.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I saw it a little bit at Petty Arcade Expo, that was about it.

47:30.000 --> 47:31.000
It's like Ready to Rumble.

47:31.000 --> 47:32.000
Okay.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
You're also getting it on the PlayStation 3, Facebreaker this week, and that's pretty much your big titles.

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
That's really your only big title on the current systems.

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
However, the Wii gets a whole load of crap this week, including Wii Music makes its way out this week.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
Oh boy.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
The music doesn't stop there.

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
You also get the Guitar Hero games are finally making their way to the Wii this week in Japan.

47:51.000 --> 47:57.000
Legends of Rock, that's Guitar Hero 3, as well as Aerosmith, and a bundle for Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
I believe that is, again, just like last week on the other systems, that's Guitar Hero 3 by itself,

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
because I think the bundle was all they had for a while.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
So there you go.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
Also, a game called Skycrawlers, coming out from Namco Bandai,

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
and Daikaiju Battle, Ultra Colosseum, coming out also from Bandai Namco on the Wii.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
That's big monsters.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Ah, very cool.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
Well, there you go. So a pretty big week for the Wii over in Japan.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
If you want to head over to last gen, Arcana Heart gets a price reduction.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It's moving into the best series.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
And Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Meisters, comes out this week as well.

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
And now we're going to move over to the handhelds and take a look at what's coming out of the Nintendo DS.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Yadaman 2 DS comes out this week.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Coldsept DS, that should be fun.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I like Coldsept on the 360.

48:43.000 --> 48:51.000
Away, Shuffle Dungeon, also this week, and Nazo Nazo and Quiz Ichi Kotei Jikan Kyumate comes out as well from Konami this week.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Sounds like some type of quiz little show there.

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
Coming out on some of the Sony handheld system, that would be the PSP.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
It looks like just a bunch of accessories.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I think they're getting some new bundles this week.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
They have a new Slim coming out in Pearl White and Piano Black.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
And with that comes a whole bunch of other new accessories.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I think that's the PSP 3000.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Oh yeah, that is. It's the new redo of the PSP.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
Comes out this week, so some of you might be actually importing that.

49:21.000 --> 49:29.000
And if you're not, well, you can look forward to Yusha no Kusei ni Namakida or 2 comes out this week in Japan.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
And that is a first person title.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
And it looks like some type of puzzle game.

49:35.000 --> 49:41.000
I think that's the one that's also supposed to be on the PlayStation Network at the same time.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
He said that's a first person game. That's like a reverse.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Oh sorry, first party game.

49:45.000 --> 49:50.000
That was like a reverse of what they did with Conduit.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Alright, so there you go, your Japanese release dates.

49:52.000 --> 49:57.000
Let's head over to the other pond across the Atlantic this time.

49:57.000 --> 50:01.000
Well, on the 13th comes Equestrian Training on the DS.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
That would be, I think that's today now over there, so oops.

50:05.000 --> 50:10.000
On the 17th, Golden Axe Beast Rider on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 on Damn Near Everything.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
Rapala Fishing Frenzy, whatever, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
Saints Row 2 for PlayStation 3 PC and Xbox 360.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
And What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver on DS.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
So, that would be it.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
I think that's coming out here in a few weeks too.

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
I have absolutely zero interest in that, because you know what?

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
I have a kitchen, and I have food, and I know how to cook.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I have Iron Chef.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
I have the Iron Chef book, and it's awesome.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
That little red book?

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
Yeah.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Isn't that great?

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
I want to actually try making the Home Bar Lobster dish that was in there.

50:49.000 --> 50:55.000
Anyways, enough about Iron Chef, but if we are going to talk about Iron Chef.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
The secret ingredient is more skins for Little Big Planet.

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
And GameStop is sweetening the deal with their pre-orders.

51:03.000 --> 51:12.000
Before you could get your Kratos skin on, or at least see different parts of it to create your own Kratos Sackboy.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
But now you'll be getting also a Medusa.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Looks like a skin set there.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
And costumes for, looks like a minotaur.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
So that's pretty awesome.

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
And those will be available when the game is released a couple weeks from now.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
So that's pretty sweet.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
And then, of course, Tokyo Game Show.

51:33.000 --> 51:37.000
They were showing off a few more things.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
Skins for Solid Snake from, of course, Metal Gear Solid.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
And from Final Fantasy VII, they have Sephiroth.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Oh joy.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
No cloud, though. I don't understand why.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
How are you going to have a battle?

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Oh my god, you know what that means.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
There's going to be a Final Fantasy VII remake on PlayStation 3.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
This is proof.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.000
And it's going to be done with Sackboys.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
It's like Potter Puppet Pals, but for the next gen.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
Dude, that would be the best game ever.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
That actually would be kind of awesome.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Final Fantasy Puppet Pals. The game.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Very, very awesome.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
Cool, cool.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
Do you have your little big planet pre-ordered? Are you getting this, Loki?

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Yes, I am.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
All right.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Redertainment in chat's kind of pissed.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
He says, Sephiroth? No cloud? What the fuck?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Give it time. That's all I know.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Cloud will be later.

52:25.000 --> 52:29.000
Cloud comes with your Final Fantasy VII remake pre-ordered. Duh.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Hello?

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
By the way, speaking of little big planets, some other news.

52:34.000 --> 52:37.000
There was a little bit of, will they, won't they, with the beta?

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
And will the levels made in the beta be playable in the final game?

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
And the answer is...

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Unicron.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
No, the answer is yes.

52:45.000 --> 52:50.000
And it was confirmed to 1UP because they're able to get confirmations from big developers.

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
That indeed, the things that people have been making in the beta, they will transfer over to the final game.

52:55.000 --> 53:02.000
Apparently, though, they're kind of gauging how people feel about this news on the official PlayStation forums.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
So they might change their mind.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Why would you not like this idea, huh?

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
Because they want everybody to start on the same page.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
That's dumb.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
You don't have access to all the same stuff in the beta, right?

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
Yeah, I'd say it's win-win because you start the game, there's a ton of fucking content to download.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Exactly.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Why would that be bad? That's good.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Now I can play Bobby's level.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
Bobby Blackwolf, of course, is the man who does the show before us here on All Games Radio.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
He actually made a little level that's cute.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
It's like the quest, because there's a YouTube of it somewhere if you look up his YouTube account.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
It's like the quest to get a beta code.

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
And it's funny.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It's cute. It kind of shows what you can do with the game.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
Because, you know, we had that little demo at Penny Arcade Expo and kind of got to play the game.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
We didn't get to see a lot of the editor.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
We really didn't get to see a lot about editing the levels.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
And it was kind of cool to see what you can really create.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
I don't know how much time he spent on that, but I imagine it wasn't that much.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
I hope the Wall of Awesome level's in there.

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
With my picture on it.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
What level's...what?

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
Remember? Because I beat the developer at that little mini-game thing that he did.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Oh yeah, okay.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
So I got a picture on the Wall of Awesome.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Oh, maybe.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
But maybe that was just for Penny Arcade Expo. Who knows?

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Yeah. Perhaps.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Awesome.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
Well, there you go.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
We'll be looking for that.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
I'm finally going to have to crack and buy a PlayStation 3 in a couple weeks, finally, I think.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Because I do want this game.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
I was just thinking about that, actually.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
How so?

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
You know, that was for SingStar, right?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
No, no. For LittleBigPlanet.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I mean, I don't know why I said that.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
I was thinking about SingStar, though.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Because I've also...okay, because I've also talked about...

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Because you wanted the ABBA.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Right, because I wanted SingStar ABBA.

54:35.000 --> 54:40.000
My brain was doing that thing where it jumps topics without me actually saying anything about it.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
No, it's fine. I have said that before.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
But I was thinking about that.

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
Are those the only two games that you're interested in to get the system?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
For right now, but I'm also interested in Home.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I think Home's going to be kind of cool.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
And, you know, we'll see what kind of comes up next year.

54:56.000 --> 54:59.000
I mean, I was just wondering if that would really be your only two reasons.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
And the fact that it's a Blu-ray player. I can benefit from that, too.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Yeah.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
There's enough for me.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
Well, we've been discussing the PSP earlier.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.000
Well, here's something that we finally have a confirmation on.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
Yoshida Shuhei has said it himself.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
That Gran Turismo PSP is in development.

55:20.000 --> 55:27.000
But it's...there's actually no real date on it yet.

55:27.000 --> 55:32.000
In fact, according to this article, when he was asked about it, he actually said,

55:32.000 --> 55:33.000
Good question.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
It's in Polyphony Digital and they're working on it.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
So, at any rate, they say that the reason that it's been delayed

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
is because Polyphony's been working on other projects,

55:45.000 --> 55:49.000
but they have been working on Gran Turismo 5 Prolog

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
and Gran Turismo 5 for PS3,

55:51.000 --> 55:59.000
so they were actually working on the PS3 as their priority,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
and not the PSP one.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
But when he was asked when it would be, he said,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
No comment.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
That's a lame excuse, I think, because this has been in development

56:12.000 --> 56:15.000
since before the PSP was released.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
So come on, man. Seriously.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
It's been in development for a long time now.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
It'll be out when Duke Nukem Forever is out.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
They have to make the graphics extra pretty, remember?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Oh, my ass.

56:26.000 --> 56:27.000
It's just like they were saying,

56:27.000 --> 56:32.000
Oh, well, we don't know how to make the cars take damage and stuff,

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
and the car manufacturers don't want us to dirty up their cars and stuff yet.

56:38.000 --> 56:43.000
Other games have the same licensed cars and realistic damage modeling.

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
Excuses, excuses, excuses.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
And you know what?

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
By the time your stupid game is released, no one will care.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
The end.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
The end.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.000
But one thing you can do in the meantime with your PSP,

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
since you won't be playing Gran Turismo on it,

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
is you can use it as a secondary monitor.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Thanks to the homebrew community, they have released an app,

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
and I know there's another one out there that's also part of something else

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
that can do the same thing, but

57:10.000 --> 57:18.000
PSP DISP version 0.1 allows you to connect your PSP to your PC via the USB cable

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
and use it as a secondary monitor.

57:20.000 --> 57:23.000
It's able to display graphics.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
The hell would you fit on it?

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
Graphics of 960x544.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
It's just you have to kind of pan the image around.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.000
But you can do that, and it's supported, of course, only on the custom firmwares.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Of course.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
4.01 M33 and above.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
So wait, while I have World of Warcraft going on my main computer screen,

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
I can have WoW head up in a browser window on my secondary screen?

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Yes.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
That's kind of neat.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Yeah.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
So, I mean, it's cheap.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
It's good for, like, you know, visualizations or whatever,

57:58.000 --> 58:02.000
or if you're working on something and you want to view something on your other screen.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
Or what if you're designing a PSP website?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
That doesn't work.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
Don't!

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
No.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
PSP doesn't display stuff quite like...

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
You see what I was trying to get at, though.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.000
I see what you're trying to get at, yeah.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
You've designed the lovely olrpsp.com,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
which includes the all-games radio player,

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
so you can listen to us on your PSP live on Sunday nights.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
Yeah, unfortunately the PSP does not display stuff the same as your PC,

58:25.000 --> 58:29.000
and it makes it kind of difficult because you have to constantly tweak stuff

58:29.000 --> 58:32.000
and then refresh, tweak stuff, refresh.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.000
Yeah.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
All right.

58:34.000 --> 58:38.000
Well, look, one thing that you're going to be able to enjoy a lot more on your PSP,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
and it doesn't even have to run custom firmware,

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
LocoRoco 2!

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
Come on, you knew it was coming because Sony really hyped up the first LocoRoco game.

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
You knew it was coming.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
You know what's kind of interesting, though?

58:48.000 --> 58:51.000
The game has also been confirmed for Europe as well as Japan, obviously.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
We all know it's going there.

58:52.000 --> 58:57.000
But the thing is that actually the game is going to be coming out first in Europe.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
The game is coming out in November.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
That's right, November in Europe,

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
and no date announced yet for Japan as far as I know.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
I believe it might be early next year.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
So those of you folks over in Europe that always complain you get the shaft,

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Sony loves you!

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
They're giving you LocoRoco 2 first.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
There you go.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
LocoRoco is awesome.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.000
No word about the American release, though.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Which is kind of sad-ish.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
We'd better get it.

59:24.000 --> 59:27.000
I would think that it would do so much better here than it did there.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
The question is when.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Will we have to wait until last?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
Will we be in between?

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Well, LocoRoco came out here last time.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Oh, wait, no, that's Patapon.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Never mind.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.000
Which is also getting a sequel.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
That's what ActDeaf just said in chat.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
chat.net.org.com.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
Patapon 2 is also coming.

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Yes.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
Pwn, pwn, patapon.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Patapon.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Well, our next bit of news makes me super happy.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
That is, if it doesn't suck as much as some of the other later releases did.

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
But there's going to be a new Castlevania game on PS3 and Xbox 360.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
And it's...

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
They actually showed about ten seconds of footage of it.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And no gameplay.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
It was nothing.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
It's being produced by Igarashi.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
And, you know, he's my hero and I got to meet him.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
It made me so happy.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
So maybe it's going to be good.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I'm actually more excited about the other one that's coming out on the handheld.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Oh, yeah, Order of Othello.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Order of Othello, yeah.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Oh, yeah.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Igarashi and Igaraki should get together and form a death metal band.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I think it would be awesome.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Don't you think?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Igarashi and Igarashi?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yes, Igarashi and Igaraki should get together.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
The Dead or Alive guy and the Castlevania guy should get together and form a death metal band.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Dude, he's such a rockstar.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
He's on the picture here.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Wearing a leather cowboy hat and holding a whip.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
And I'm like, dude, you're hot.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And then Mizuguchi can play keyboards.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
And then who would be the singer?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
What game designer would be the singer for that band?

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Posting the picture in the chatroom.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Because, dude, I'm sorry.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
He looks like a freaking rockstar.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
He is a freaking rockstar.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
That's why I'm thinking.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yes, and DarkTessuya says, and do a game.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
They should all come together and do a game.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I would die of, I would have a fan-gasm right there.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I don't know, but they would never agree.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
They would kill each other first.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I bet if you gave them both the same premise of the game,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
we'd get something fucked up from both of them, but in different ways.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
TheRobD says Miyamoto would be the conductor.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Inafume is the singer.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
It's funny.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Anyhow, we'll see.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
But anyway, before our dream game designer death metal band comes true, we'll see probably Castlevania.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
current gen.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Itagaki is the Gene Simmons of the gaming world.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Perfect.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
The Gene Simmons of the gaming world.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Perfect. He needs a reality show.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Well, there are some really cool features that were announced for Resistance Retribution.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:08.000
And it kind of works with, a little similar to how some of the PlayStation 2 games would link with the PSP in different ways.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Well now, what you're going to be able to do with this is, it's a brand new feature called PSP Plus.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And using Resistance Retribution via USB cable, connecting it to your PS3,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
you will actually be able to use your DualShock 3 controller and play the game just using that.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And then, you can also unlock abilities that are in Resistance 2, the character in that game.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Nathan Hale, you'll be able to unlock the same abilities for your character in this game.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And will also allow you to get to different parts of levels and stuff like that.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Kind of think a little bit like the stuff they had with Sonic and Knuckles,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
where you can plug in the other Sonic games and get to different portions of the game and stuff like that.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
So, that's kind of cool.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And I guess this would also fix that problem with not having the second analog stick,

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
because it does change the controllers though, or the controls around, since you have that second analog stick to look around.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Or how about they just redesign the PSP with the second analog stick,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
instead of having this roundabout way that requires the PlayStation 3 as well.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Hmm, I'll check it out though.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Yeah, I mean, you're still going to get this game no matter what, right?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Resistance 2, it will.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Anyhow, also, moving on to one more story on the PSP, and then we're going to get towards our break time tonight.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
On the PSP, there is the Wi-Fi store.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Remember we've been talking about the Wi-Fi store that's coming?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Hey, the date has been announced.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
October 15th, the Wi-Fi store will be launched in Japan,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
but you know that it's not much longer before it's here.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:48.000
And that probably is in line with the fact that the PSP 3000 comes out this week as well,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
so don't think there's not a correlation there.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
With the 5.0 firmware.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That's right, 5.0 firmware will also be the same time.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
The Wi-Fi store is already on the box art for the PSP 3000, so...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Well, which makes sense, because if the PSP 3000 doesn't hit street until October 16th,

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
they're basically launching this the day before.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
There you go.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Some games that are going to be sold on the store that already are dated,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Secret Agent Clank on November 20th,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Patapon 2 on November 27th,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
and LocoRoco 2 on December 4th.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
There's that date I was looking for earlier, so yeah,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Europe's getting it by a couple weeks.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
LocoRoco 2 specifically,

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
because the store itself has not been announced for the US or Europe,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
but I would speculate, well, whenever the new PSP redesign is coming out here,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
that's when we'll get the store.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
October, yeah, it's like right around the corner.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
That's what I thought.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Usually those firmware updates, they're all about the same time,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
like within a day of each other.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Alright, so anyhow, the Wi-Fi store is going to be opening soon,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
and also opening soon as part B of our show,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
but before we get to part B of our radio show,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
we need to get to the classic video game of the week.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
It's a little segment we do here every week on this program

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
where DarkSakura takes a look through history's past

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
to find a game for us to look at.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
So tell us, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Well, if anyone could guess from the music...

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
They won't hear that on the podcast, by the way.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I want to edit that little boo-boo out, so...

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Well, then I would totally give them a cookie,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
you know, a virtual cookie,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
but the game of the week is KOU Gekitai,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
which came out over here as KOU Flying Squadron.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
It's a game of a girl who has this ancestral obligation

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
to go destroy monsters while riding on the back of her lazy little dragon friend.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Her dragon is named Poji in the American version and the UK version.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
He was called Spot.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
But anyway, her...

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Bunny, I don't see a spot.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Her special outfit, though, that she has to wear for destroying evil is a bunny girl suit.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000
It came out... We actually got it as KOU Flying Squadron on the Sega CD over here.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
There's also KOU Gekitai Katsu Gekihen,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
which was KOU Flying Squadron 2, which was on Saturn.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
That's the game. I actually own that one.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.000
There was also KOU Gekitai Okira Tamatai Bako, which is like a demo CD.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And then there was Ramichan no Oedos Tsugoroku KOU Gekitai Gaiden,

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000
which was like a special bonus story for Rami, who is the little girl in the game.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
So it is a little shooting game.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
It's a cutesy little shooting game where, like I said,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Rami sits on the back of a dragon, and she has a large mallet for hitting enemies.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.000
She has an umbrella for hitting enemies, and a bow, so she can shoot arrows at enemies.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Rami can bounce on enemies' heads and kill them that way.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
You can also shoot at them, and you get little bonus buddies to help you.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I guess it's like your options that was in KOU Flying Squadron 2.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
The first one had, it was basically just a few less options of that since it was very limited.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And all this audio in it, of course, was redbook audio.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Are those pigs that look like people?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Yes.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Cool.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
So they're very fun little games.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
There's also, in KOU Flying Squadron 2, there's another character called Himiko,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000
who made a robot called the Saivi, and she was KOU's rival.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I'm not K-O, why am I thinking? Rami's rival.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
And then there was an intelligent raccoon who was their enemy.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
He was a member of Greenpeace.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
And he's from Mexico.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
A raccoon from Mexico.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
He was a member of Greenpeace.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
He was a bad guy.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
So that's...

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
This looks kind of cute. I've never heard of this game in my life.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It's cracked out.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Because I didn't really follow the whole Sega empire until years later.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
But this is cute.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Kind of a fun little shmup.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
It's a fun little game. I love it.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Very cool.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And also just to go ahead and give a plug to the site, because I checked it out last night.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Go to SoaringRabbit.com.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
There's lots of cool art from the game on there and stuff from the guidebooks and things.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
It's a really cool little site.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
KO Flying Squadron is your game of the week.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Check it out on the Sega Saturn, if you can.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
But if you can't, you'll just have to watch clips on YouTube or try to find an emulator or something.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Can you emulate Sega Saturn yet? Have they gotten to that point?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
I think they can. I just haven't bothered.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
You can play Sega Saturn games.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Yes, you can, basically.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Alright, awesome.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Well hey folks, we're going to take a break.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But don't go anywhere, because when we come back there will be plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
So reports from BlizzCon. We haven't even gotten to BlizzCon yet.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.000
So stay tuned. We're hoping somebody's going to call in or we're going to call somebody and get a report.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I would say live from BlizzCon, but that can't happen because BlizzCon is now over.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So not live from BlizzCon.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:31.000
So we'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
He did. He's going to be the next president.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
He's like, do you see those fucking lights on the ground?

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
When they get red, STFU.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
God, I know.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Pukaki.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Anyhow, we've got some gaming news to get back into.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Hope you enjoyed that music break for those of you guys listening live.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
If you're not listening live, why not?

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
You should join us on Sunday nights live.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You can even listen to us on the go, thanks to the OLR PSP website that has the all games radio player.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I think some folks are listening to us on iPhones as well.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I think there's some application you can use to do that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Some type of tuning program.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
So, pretty awesome.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
But we've got some more gaming news to cover.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
We've got a BlizzCon report to get to.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Actually, first off though, since we've been talking about conventions,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I want to start this segment off before we get to the actual gaming news.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Reading responses to our Twitter question, the pre-OLR Twit,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
for those of you guys following us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000
we asked the question tonight, and it was actually about the Tokyo Game Show.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
It was actually what we were asking about tonight.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
We wanted to know, have you ever wanted to go to the Tokyo Game Show, and why?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
What's the biggest reason you want to go?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Dark Soccer, I'm sure you've wanted to go to the Tokyo Game Show before.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
I'm Pon Man!

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Is that why?

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.000
No.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Alright, here's some of our listeners and their responses and why they want to go.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Let's see, Javier Altman says, yes, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Why? To get into the panties of as many booth babes as humanly possible.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Them love Latin cock, oh yeah.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
That was a nice G-rated response.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Dark Tetsuya says, hell yes, I've always wanted to go to Japan anyway,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
but an event like TGS with all the newest Japanese games do want.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Maron Marvel says, heck yes, I could go if I could.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Squeenix and Konami are bound to unveil some awesome things to Tokyo Game Show.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Plus, you know it's Tokyo.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Act Dev says, yes, it's basically E3, but done way better.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
So it's basically all the great announcements we hear.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I would like to hear them firsthand.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Jackson Man says, I'm from Kentucky, so going anywhere but here would be nice.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Crows says, of course I want to go.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Japanese games almost always have more.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
I want to go and learn which upcoming games have little anime girls.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000
GeoVidea says, oh hell yes, it's Japan.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
I've been trying to get there for a few years now.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
MistyOLR says, admittedly not really.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I have ASEN and I can actually afford that con compared to going all the way to Japan.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000
A nice realistic answer from Misty.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Justin says, nah, it's all about PAX.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I did E3 a few times when it was good.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
That's enough OMG Game Show spectacle for me.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
So surprisingly, a couple people saying no.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I would have assumed that it would have been right 100% yeses across the board.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So surprises abound on our Twitter.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Thanks for the responses, folks.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Well, I think the whole reason that I would really want to go

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
is to go hang out with my friends that live over there.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Yeah, you know, just to go somewhere else.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I've never been to Japan. It would be fun.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I mean, because really, after having been to E3 all those years,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
it really is a big spectacle, that type of thing, don't you think?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
There's something about being there.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It's like magic in the air.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I don't know, it makes you more excited about everything.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
More like unwashed fanboys in the air over here.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Oh, shush.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
All right, let's get back into some gaming news now that we've heard from you Twitter folks tonight.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Loki, all right.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Well, this is sort of a rumor right now,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
but apparently the website tinycartridge.com is reporting

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:12.000
that they have found a trademark registered in Japan for what is called DS Scan.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
And what they theorize it is,

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:21.000
is it's something that's going to be used with the DS Eyes camera to unlock DS content.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Now, one of the things that they're also speculating is that it's for use with QR codes.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Which those who do not know,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
QR codes are those square kind of pixely looking, almost like a UPC code, basically.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And cell phones have them.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Most cell phones over in Japan have them.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And you find them everywhere, like on boxes, to magazine articles, to websites, etc.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
And you basically scan it with your camera,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
and it will take you to a website, reveal more information.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Some examples are nutritional information on food, directions on Google Maps,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
contact details, business cards, etc.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Or even links to different game developer sites and stuff like that.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So that would be a pretty cool feature,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
and especially since the DS Eyes is going to have a built-in web browser,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I could see something like that actually being implemented.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
So right now, it's all speculation to see how that's going to work.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I don't know.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Interesting comments from the chat room.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Frisbee in chat, chat.orangestop.com, says,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
DSI e-reader, and Unfolded Raptor says,

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Sad thing I actually bought an e-reader, what a waste of money.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Act Def says, I have some Animal Crossing e-reader cards.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Whatever happened to the e-reader?

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I think it's one of those peripherals that they didn't really support that much.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
But could this be something like that?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
This could be something like that.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Like, they could release cards.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I would think would be kind of cool.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Before, remember, they were talking about doing something with the DS version of Viva Pinata,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000
where they were going to have images that appear on the DS,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.000
and you can scan them with your Xbox 360 camera and import your characters into that.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Well, now you can do it vice versa that way.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Oh, but I'm getting total value for my Xbox 360 camera right now.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
I mean, did you see Camera Mode in Beaten Groovy?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Wahoo!

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Oh, I'm sorry. I missed that.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
What was Camera Mode in Beaten Groovy?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It's just, now you hit balloons.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
It's just, it's tacked on junk.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Lame. Awesome.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:28.000
No, actually, sadly enough, I'm going to be coming into contact with another camera,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
because I'm buying that game You're in the Movies.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Why?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Because it looks fun. It's like a fun party game.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Alright.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And it unfortunately comes with another camera, so now I have two useless cameras.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Congratulations.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Well, how about some other Nintendo news that you can really get excited about coming out of Tokyo Game Show?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.000
No More Heroes 2 is coming out.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Now, here's the thing, though.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Actually, it wasn't really necessarily confirmed for the Nintendo Wii.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Yeah, it's for the Wii.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Is it?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Oh, okay.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Because I remember when they saw the trailer, it didn't say Wii anywhere in it.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So some people were actually speculating a little bit.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
But alright, it sounds like it was confirmed for the Wii, which makes sense.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
You know, it makes sense.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
No More Heroes, Desperate Struggle is the name of the game.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000
See, people thought it might have been for the DS, because, you know, Desperate Struggle.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
DS.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Oh, good thought, yeah.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
So okay, yeah, that makes sense.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:24.000
And of course, there's folks wishful thinking it would be on 360 or PlayStation 3.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
But I wish it were.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It's another Wii game.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
You played a lot of the first No More Heroes game, Loki.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Are you excited?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Yeah, I am excited. I thought it looks awesome.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And I just wish, though, that it was on the 360.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Because it'd be even more awesome.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
More awesomer?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Yeah. Actually, you know, I wish a lot of the games that they're putting on the Wii

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
were on, like, the 360 or PS3.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Like, No More Heroes, Mad World.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Well, here's what's strange.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And, you know, again, here's a story that didn't really make show world tonight.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000
It's just been a busy week.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
But there's rumors going around about the Wii HD again.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
And the successor to Nintendo Wii is coming out in 2011.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I don't know why this rumor has suddenly caught more steam.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
And you know who I was looking at was being sourced for the rumor?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Get this.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
WhatTheyPlay.com was being sourced as, like, the start of the rumor, right?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Which, you know, just makes me think of WhatTheyPlay.com snap.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
The reason why is because people keep reporting the same rumor story,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
but people keep seeing the rumor story on multiple websites.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
It's like, Oh, my God, it's actually true.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
But it's actually all the same story.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000
It's just some dude's opinion that used to work for 1UP.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Here's the other thing, too, is that it's, you know,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
will there be a follow-up to Wii?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Duh.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Yes, of course there's going to be a follow-up to the Wii system.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I mean, the thing is sold millions and jillions.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Of course there's going to be a follow-up.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
It's just a question of when.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
So people like to pull dates out of their fucking butts as to when it's coming.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And, you know, if they're off, they'll just say, Oh, it just got delayed.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Or, Oh, they're putting it out early.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
It's just a bunch of crap.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Of course there's going to be a Wii follow-up.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Why is this news?

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I saw it, like, on the front page of Yahoo as the successor to the Wii.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Who cares?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
When was that new?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I know, for real.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Anyway, sorry.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It says, When is Yahoo known for reporting game news?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Look, I use their mail service, so I see the stuff on the page that they're saying.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I know.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
I completely understand.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
It's just, you know, it was a little weird to me, that's all.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Especially since they're trying to sell some new video gaming news thing.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And, you know, if that's your cutting-edge story, I weep for the future.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Anyhow.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I weep all the time, anyway.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Nice.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Well, Nintendo points are not going to transfer between the Wii and the DSi.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
It is, um, official.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
They have their own points.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.000
And let me guess, it'll be one of those things where I have to buy, you know, ten or twenty dollars worth of points at a time,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.000
and then the games will cost just enough so that I have, like, three hundred left over at any given time.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Yeah.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Correct?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000
That's correct.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Well, basically, that pretty much is, yeah.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But they have to be separate.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Yeah.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It's totally impossible for a service to do that.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:20.000
It's not like, you know, companies like Microsoft have, I don't know, Microsoft points that you can use on both Xbox Marketplace or, I don't know, the Zune Marketplace.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
It's totally impossible.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
That technology does not exist.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
More like they just don't want to.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Of course they don't want to.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
That would be effort.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It's just like effort in, I don't know, making, uh...

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And less money from our money-making machines.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Making a unified online service for the Wii or the DS, or, I don't know, releasing games that aren't really ports.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Or innovating a little bit more than just your initial hardware.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Redertainment says in chat, it's like selling six hot dogs to a pack by eight buns to a pack.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Exactly.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
That's a perfect analogy.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Um, AlphaConanagram says it's all Nintendo points now.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
That's what I thought.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
I thought it was gonna be all Nintendo points.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000
It is all Nintendo points now.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.000
You know, once you put those Nintendo points in, like, you know, one place and you can't really do anything with them.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000
You're stuck.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000
Yeah, you can't name.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Because you have two different accounts.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Because, once again, there's no unified online service.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Grrr.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:16.000
I'm surprised they don't have, you know, like, a friend code for the points or something like that that you gotta put in.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
You know, make sure that you can buy that game or something.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Or that you have to write with your stylus, all praise Nintendo.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I agree.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Do you wish to purchase said game?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Blue?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Blue?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
No!

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
In fact, the DSi will actually have a place that will prick your finger for blood every time you, uh, actually want to get points.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Yeah, that's how you pay for the games.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
With your blood.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000
With your soul.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.000
It's like, it's like, do you wish to purchase this game and relinquish your soul?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
What?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I just sold my soul for a donut.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yes.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Retertainment.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
That's perfect.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
You have to write every time.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Nintendo, lemming.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Bah, bah, bah.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Anyhow.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000
You know what segment of ours has to follow a story like this.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:27.000
My FU of the Week goes towards, um, you know what, I don't know that I have one for once.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Gasp.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
No.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
FU to your lack of angst?

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Well, no, it's because I'm a Vicodin.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And Vicodin makes you not give a shit about anything.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Oh yeah, okay, I've got one.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Mr. Moron.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
FU to people.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Anyone who thinks I'm insulted by anything, anyone has to say about me.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Because that's obviously a sign that someone else has the issue, and I do not.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Don't come to my cubicle expecting me not to tell you to get out of my cubicle.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Because, okay, okay, the situation is that someone came into my cubicle, someone who I've had a problem doing this before,

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.000
came and tried to talk to somebody on the other side of my cubicle, and I'm like, dude, please get out.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I need to, you know, do my work.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You're bugging me.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Get the hell away from me because I don't really like you that much either.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:27.000
And he just started mumbling and just trying to say, you know, just really stupid insulting things.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And I got, you know what I did?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
I laughed.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I just laughed.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I laughed so hard right there.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I was like, dude, you know how stupid you sound?

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
And so he left and didn't bother me the rest of the day.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And that's just what I'm going to do from now on.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.000
If someone, anyone ever tries to just, you know, be mean, I'm just going to laugh.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000
That's all.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000
My response from now on is going to be, aha.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I love this.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
The Raftian Chat says, I've seen her cubicle.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Much like you would expect from Dark Sakura, it's filled with pink fluffy clouds and is generally welcoming.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.000
The hell it is.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Yeah, I killed him with laughter.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Because, I mean, basically, okay, keep in mind, I've had this problem before.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And the whole reason that I think that people try to be insulting, especially when they're in the wrong, is to make themselves feel less wrong to put themselves in a position of superiority.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
And this person has absolutely zero room.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000
And I can say that in a completely unbiased fashion.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Yes, I do have the giant Tekken poster in my cubicle.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Thank you.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
That's what you say?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
No, I was answering that comment.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That I just, I just laughed.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I just laughed.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:49.000
It's like, how can someone say that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about when this is the same person that asks me how to copy cells in Excel?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Don't ask.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Control C, control V.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Exactly.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000
SSG100 Matt says, you need to set up gun turrets at the entrance of your cubicle.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Actually, I was looking at ThinkGeek just a moment ago and they do have USB missile launchers.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Those are overrated.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Trust me, I have one at my desk.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
It's just retarded.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000
It sits there for a second and goes eeeeeeee, pop, and then it goes boop, and like falls down a few feet away.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I could build a better rocket launcher.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It was worth it just to hear Loki's expression.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
And then it was like beep, and then it goes boop, and it's like boop.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
My cubicle drains the souls of other people and it gives them to me.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000
They have a way to convert it into an airsoft gun.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Oh, Lord.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Alright, let's have you use the lead.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Any more, Dark Zyra.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Also, F you to me not having the money right now to buy the beaker coffee mug from ThinkGeek.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Alright, Loki.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
F you to myself for buying a magazine for my gun that's a double mag.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:49.000
The problem is because it's basically two magazines that are stuck next to each other when I plug it in,

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.000
the other magazine covers the switch that allows me to pop the magazine out.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000
So it makes it near impossible to take out the magazine once I put it in.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Doh! Should have paid attention.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Still love it though.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Alright, that it?

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Also an F you to my Triton headphones I've got.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Already the left side, basically if you jiggle the cord a little bit, it will go out.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So that pisses me off because they were expensive.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.000
I want to give an F you to the pig fucker who stole the political sign from my front yard earlier this week,

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
not even 24 hours after I placed it up.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
As you know, we have a very controversial proposition in the ballot here in California.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
They want to ban same-sex marriage and take rights away from people

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
and treat certain people of this country differently than others, or of the state, I should say.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
This is a state proposition.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
And it's called Proposition 8.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:44.000
They're using scare tactics to do it which aren't even true.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
They are not going to tax churches.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
They're not going to force churches to marry people they don't want to marry.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Do atheists get married in church right now?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Do they force churches to marry people?

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Can a non-Catholic get married in mass?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000
They don't, I mean, when we were getting married and trying to have a Jewish wedding,

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:10.000
you know, the female, what was it, the female, not priest, what's the word I'm looking for here?

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Rabbi.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Rabbi.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Yes, the female rabbi, she's like, no, I don't want to marry a non-Jew and a Jew together.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I'm like, you're a fucking female rabbi.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
There's not supposed to be female rabbis, idiot.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Fucking contradictive.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Look, look, I don't want to turn this into something too political,

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
but obviously I think this is the dumbest proposition of all propositions.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:38.000
And if you support, I guess, bigotry in the 21st century, then I guess you can go vote yes on it

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
because that's all it is, is just, you know, it's hate and discrimination.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And like in the fucking year 2008, you wouldn't think that we would have to be fighting for these types of things

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
that our grandparents fought for, but I guess history repeats itself, so what the fuck ever.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:57.000
But anyhow, obviously, for obvious reasons, a very staunch supporter of the No On 8 campaign,

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
so I had a No On 8 sign in the front yard of my house, and it got stolen within 24 hours

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
because that's just the kind of idiocy that's behind the support of this proposition,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:14.000
absolute moronism behind Proposition 8 that would steal a yard sign from the front of my house

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
to make a goddamn point.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
The point you made was that you're an idiot, end of story.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
So guess what? I had a second sign waiting in the house, and I promptly put it up in its place.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
You should electrify it, Rob.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000
The good idea was to rub it down on something sticky.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
By the way, Sauce pointed out to me, just for me to inform Loki,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
is that female rabbis are allowed in Reform Judaism.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Right, it depends what branch of the-

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
They're allowed, I understand that, but the problem is, like, originally, they're not-

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
That's why it's Reformed.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Exactly. But it's okay to also marry, you know, out of the religion, but it's just-

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
They're just being stupid. It's like, oh, so this is okay, but it's not okay.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:28:01.000
What pisses me off, and I have to add to Rob's F.U., is just, um, like, uh, the, uh-

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I haven't seen the commercials, but I've heard of them, and I've been told of the content of them.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
You know, I don't watch TV.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You know, them saying all that bullshit is, like, they're trying to appeal to the stupid, pretty much.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
To the uninformed, to the ignorant.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
They're trying to scare people that we're gonna have to teach it in schools.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
That is complete nonsense.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
They don't teach.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Do you talk about regular marriage in schools?

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Oh, come on, they don't even want to teach about heterosexual sex in school.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
For real. For real.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
So where the fuck do they get off?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.000
When, when hasn't a child been allowed to sit out of sex education?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It's just so ridiculous.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
You know what, if they-

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
If you believe their lies, I'm sorry. I cannot hold back and play nice on this.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
If you believe this, you are an idiot.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Please unsubscribe from this show. We are too smart for you.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
Seriously, I'm fucking serious.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And, I'll tell you what, if we get any emails to the point, you're not getting read.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.000
You're, um, getting published.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Your email address is getting published.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I don't care, I'll do it.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Just bugs me.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000
Yep.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Sorry.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
This is war.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
But, you know, this is what I have to say, actually, Rob.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah, go ahead.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even though they're wrong.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
But not on this. I'm sorry.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:27.000
No, this, we have to be fair. This is America.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I understand, but at the same time, your rights stop where mine begin.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000
I agree. Now, this was my second point.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Is that, yes, you're allowed to disagree.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
You're allowed to have your belief.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
That is what this country was founded on.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Not God or religion, because Thomas Jefferson certainly, you know, didn't follow that.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And he wrote our Declaration of Independence.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Fair enough.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:58.000
But my point is that everyone should be allowed to believe and feel what they want to believe and feel.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
They just have to also be equally tolerant of anyone who believes other than what they do.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Like, I tell everybody, be offended. Learn to be offended.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I'm having a hard time, Jamie.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Learn that someone is going to, but see, this is the problem is that we're dealing with people who aren't leaving it at that. We're dealing with people who are trying to force their point of view on other people and are, and have the majority, you know, view right now.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
All right. We're getting too much on the political topic, but.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:36.000
No, I firmly believe in, that we should be a more tolerant people.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Obviously, it's a very sensitive issue that I have a very strong and invested opinion in for obvious reasons.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:55.000
So if I'm a little bit unhinged, I apologize to a point, but certainly you need to understand that when you are voting yes on this, you are saying my rights are not OK.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:01.000
And that's why I get so fucking incensed.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000
There we go.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Sorry.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Anyhow, let's get back to the gaming news, shall we?

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Yay, video games to make everything better and make us forget about what a fucked up world we live in. Right, Loki?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yes. In fact, totally off topic here, but Rogue Squadron could be coming back to the Nintendo consoles very soon, actually.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:41.000
According to rumor mill from EGM that LucasArts has licensed out the Rogue Squadron series for a Wii remake, and then basically instead of a brand new game, they're going to have a compilation of all the Nintendo 64 and GameCube titles on one disc.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Might be like one of those play on the Wii things.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:51.000
They were not bad. Those games are pretty good, so that'd be kind of cool.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Where is my lightsaber-wielding game?

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Force Unleashed, the Clone Wars lightsaber duels.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
No, no, I mean like with the Wiimote and that whole thing. I guess there was the lightsaber duels thing.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Wii Sports Resort.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Oh yes, I forgot. Wii Sports Resort, OK.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Let me put it this way. I wouldn't want to see one until the Wii Motion Plus came out anyways, and even one that came out, I mean, they could port the arcade game. Remember the arcade game?

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I love the arcade game. That was fun.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Yeah, so GS68 said almost at the exact same time in chat, Star Wars trilogy arcade games bonus rounds.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
There you go.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Alright, hey, one of the biggest websites of the past five years, or maybe of the past decade, I mean, who does not visit YouTube?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:44.000
I mean, it's an awesome, awesome website. We even have some stuff up on YouTube. We haven't updated it in forever, but we have a YouTube channel with some of our old news broadcasts that were on there.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Who doesn't watch YouTube to catch up on some great clips from TV and Friends or whatever? This is an awesome site.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:59.000
And video games have really taken over on YouTube. I mean, heck, all these classic games of the week that Dark Soccer is reporting on, you can search for any of them on YouTube and look at clips of the game.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:04.000
And there's new game reviews and there's tons and tons of video game content out on YouTube.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Well now, what YouTube has decided they want to do, they're going to try to use this to profit.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Because right now, where does YouTube make a profit? There's not a lot of advertising on the site.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's very interesting that considering they don't sell much on YouTube, they still manage to make money.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Well, they're going to try to take that one step further and it's going to start with some of the music based on EMI music and Universal.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Well now, it's also going to be video games made by EA. So apparently, when you go like, let's say you visit a YouTube of a game made from EA, you'll be able to buy the game right there.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So there you go. It's kind of neat. And then YouTube will get a cut of the game sales. So YouTube will sell you games. There you go.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:53.000
That's a good tie-in. I mean, it's kind of a duh. I'm kind of surprised it didn't really happen before.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:04.000
But I'm curious, what about the retro games? Those are a little harder to find. But maybe eBay links or something. Who knows? Or links to used game stores, I guess.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:13.000
There you have it. YouTube. I wonder if soon you'll be able to buy DVDs of TV shows that you see on YouTube.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Or like, you know, like, TV for chocolate rain.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:25.000
I hardly ever buy things on the internet anyway. Very rare. I like to go in the store and have it in my hand. There's something to be said for that.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
Some things you can't buy in stores.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Well, whatever.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
You can buy happiness in a store.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
I cannot buy happiness in a store.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
I do all the time.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Is your mic on? You're very quiet for some reason.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Yes, it is on.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000
There we go. Now I hear you.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Dun dun dun.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Alright, sorry. Moving on.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Well, there is a bit more happy news. Why is it that I'm just getting all the happy news, Rob?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I don't know. I just, I knew you'd be on Vicodin tonight, so you just want to be happy happy.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
You'd rather give me stuff, because you know if I don't care about something else, I don't care about it.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
But this is very, very, very happy news.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
For Street Fighter IV home releases, there's been another female character confirmed.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And it's Sakura! I'm very happy.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And I watched video of it, actually, today, Rob.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And she's there in her full kickass glory, so I'm quite thrilled with that.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But she was confirmed, actually, to Famitsu by Yoshinori Ono that she was going to definitely be in the home version.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And there's also going to be a few more things in the home version, including a training mode.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Now, even though this Sakura isn't where you get your name, contrary to popular belief, you're still pretty excited about this, right?

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Oh, hell yeah.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:50.000
I actually, after there came out Dark Sakura from Marvel Superheroes vs. Street Fighter, I actually adopted her as my online avatar for a while.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Cute.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Oh, I remember that. Way back in the day on the Sacramento's DDR forum, your little avatar was Dark Sakura, the actual one.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But I had taken the picture from the ending of Rival Schools and did the sunburnt look to her and made her sailor dress black and make her red eyes.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Cool. Very cool.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Early photoshopping before I had photoshopped.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Well, I think we're all going to be playing Street Fighter IV. I'm excited about that game.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Heck yeah.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I wish it was out by Christmas, but then again, I also don't.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
I wish it was out by right now.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I also kind of don't because I need my games to be spaced out right about now because I'm still trying to work on Silent Hill Homecoming.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And then I've got World of Warcraft going on, which by the way, I deemed 50 on my alt. Thank you very much.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I will have you know though that, what was it, Street Fighter IV is supposed to be coming out around the time as the brand new Street Fighter movie.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Awesome. That'll give you a nice fresh taste in your mouth.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Anyways, Guitar Hero. World Tour is right around the corner, only a few weeks away.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And with that is going to be some brand new download content available for the game.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:09.000
They're going to have a classic rock track pack filled with a bunch of different things, including Rock and Roll Band by Boston, Hot-Blooded by Foreigner, and Jessie's Girl by Rick Springfield.

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Awesome.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And then also they're going to have a few more tracks, Blind Melons, No Rain.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Dear God, I hate that song.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:21.000
What? I love that song.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Which is in Rock Band too right now.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Overplayed?

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Aww.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
A couple...

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
No wait, Blind Melon isn't in Rock Band 2 are they?

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
No Rain I think is in there.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I don't think it is. No, I don't think it is. I would have bought that shit if it was. I actually like that song.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I thought it was. Well, whatever.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Anyways, oh no, I'm thinking Grand Theft Auto. I'm sorry. It's in Grand Theft Auto's radio thing.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Aha.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Anyways, R.E.M. is going to have a few tunes on there.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Horse to Water, Man's Size Wreath, and Supernatural Superserious.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Supernatural Superserious?

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Yeah.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.000
God, they never put in the one R.E.M. song I'd like to have in there.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Which is?

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Don't Fall On Me.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.000
What album was that on?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.000
It was on Document I think.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I'm disappointed to see that they don't have some of the Phil Collins stuff in there.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Like the ones where it's...

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Was it Hold On I guess?

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
We need Land of Confusion.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
I am just very excited to get to play Rick Springfield in Guitar Hero.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
That is going to be all kinds of awesome.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Guitar Hero World Tour, although I don't think I'm going to have the whole setup of my house.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:41.000
I'll play along with the charade, that doesn't seem to be a reason to change.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
You know I feel so dirty when they start...

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Awesome.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Let me see if I can get the game only version, but I know I'm not buying another...

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I'll probably get the...

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I want the guitar.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
I want the new guitar and I want the game.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
But that's it.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I don't need the drums and all that other shit.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Hey, Rock Band's getting some new stuff too.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:02.000
And if you like Motley Crue, this is going to be your week.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Because this is the week that you're getting Dr. Feelgood, the album.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Sweet.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
That is all kinds of awesome.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
What's that?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Was that the one that had Don't Go Away Mad?

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Well, no.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Damn.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Oh no it does, yeah it does.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
That would be my favorite Motley Crue song.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
Don't Go Away Mad, Just Go Away.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I mean it has fucking Dr. Feelgood.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
This song is all kinds of awesome.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Great album.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
He's the one that got Dr. Feelgood.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Anyway, Slice of Your Pie, Rattlesnake Shake, Kickstart My Heart.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Lots and lots and lots of good songs coming out.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
No other random songs announced yet.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Those are the only ones they've announced so far.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
There might be...

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Sometimes there's been like little random offerings from other bands that show up as well with the albums.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
But nothing so far this week.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Stephen Colbert songs.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Did Stephen Colbert have any other songs?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
We need Singing in Korean on there.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Or I want to see more South Park songs.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Or more DVDA stuff.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
They should be doing...

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
They Might Be Giants.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
And more Jonathan Coulton.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000
We'll see.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I love School Crusher Mountain, but I could totally use Ikea.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Like we need America Fuck Yeah.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Or the montage song.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Gonna need a montage.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Alright, let's get into the Journey to the Wonderland song.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Because this song is awesome and it always means...

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It's mailbag time!

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Every week you send this mail at email...

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I'm sorry, at mailbag at orangelaunchready.com.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Dark Sakura goes into the mailbag and reads her favorite emails.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Unfortunately, since there was no show and ended up getting posted on the feed last week, I believe we have Slim Pickens tonight.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Three emails.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Let's hear them.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000
This one comes from Robert M.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Note, I am not able to get into chat for some reason.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.000
If this topic has already been discussed on tonight's show, please do not trouble yourself with reading this on the air.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I also missed last week's show and haven't gotten the podcast for same yet.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Topic is Lord British in space. Best thing ever. Discuss.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
That would be freaking rad.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
Has he launched yet?

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I knew he was a private citizen that was going to be going.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Like he's one of the famous...

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.000
He bought the Russian space tourist thing and I'd heard about that.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
But I didn't know if he'd actually gone yet.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
See, I was thinking of Gradius.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
It's supposed to happen this year at some point.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I was thinking of Gradius in Salamander.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
So that's why I said best thing ever.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.000
If he's got a little ship, that would be great.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Umm...

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
An Ultima game in space.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:38.000
But really, this is basically civilian in space, right?

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Yes, except the civilian in question happens to be a famous game designer.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Seriously. I actually think that it would be a very good thing, I think, to have more civilians.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.000
You know, to be able to have that go through.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Because that just puts us that much closer to colonizing the moon.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
And then...

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Space monkeys.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I'm sorry, I was looking at the little iPhone game that John has.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
The space monkey game.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Space monkeys.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
We need space monkeys.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Next one, shall we?

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Sure, next email.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
This one comes from Rob with Two Bees.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.000
I don't know if this is an old story, but I found it on Dig.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.000
Most of the myths debunked are the media effects on children.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
There's one myth I have, personal debunking knowledge.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
And that's whether...

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Because gamers are used to train soldiers to kill.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
No, games are being used to train soldiers to kill.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
And they have the same impact on kids who play them.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
They used to work in trainers and simulators for the army.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And they're not even close to the games we play.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Even when they use the same basic software, it's modded for realism and specific training goals.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
And he says he has the same shirt in the stock photo in the article.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.000
I'm pulling up the article because I'd actually like to go over it.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
If you don't mind.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Sure.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
The availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Which actually says that we're at a 30 year low. Like, I had brought that up before a while back, right?

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I believe so.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Scientific evidence links violent gameplay to youth aggression.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:23.000
And that's actually saying that claims like this are the work of researchers who represent one relatively narrow school of research, media effects.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
The research includes some 300 studies of media violence.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:31.000
But most of these studies are inconclusive and many have been criticized on methodical grounds.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000
So, I'm sorry. Methodological grounds.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Children are the primary market for video games.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.000
And actually the center of the video game market is actually older teen to adult.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Almost no girls play computer games. Bullshit!

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:56.000
And five was the one that Rob said in his email because it's to train soldiers to kill and that's no.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Dude, even anyone should know that.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Six video games are not a meaningful form of expression.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I love this one and it was also my birthday.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:16.000
On April 19, 2002, US District Judge Steven and Lembal Sr. will the video games do not convey ideas and thus enjoy no constitutional protection.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000
As evidence, St. Louis County presented the judge with videotaped excerpts from four games.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
All within a narrow range of genre and all the subject of previous controversy.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Overturning a similar decision in Indianapolis Federal Court of Appeals, Judge Richard Posner noted,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive theme of both culture, high and low.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:46.000
It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm Anderson and Perrault are aware.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:53.000
To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be chaotic,

01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:01.000
excuse me, deforming, it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
That is, that's beautiful.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I mean, so basically, in a nutshell, you can't go shielding your children from every violent and terrible thing that's going to happen.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
They're not going to have any frame of reference for when they're an adult.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And trust me, I know people who are like this.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:29.000
There's a, one of my, I guess it's more of a, someone I know through a friend, but she was never allowed to watch the news,

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:34.000
never allowed to read anything but what her mother let her read, you know, that type of thing.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.000
And she's very, very ill prepared for her life now. I mean, to the point of about to lose her children, so.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And if kids don't know how to deal with a zombie infestation now, what's going to happen when it really does happen?

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Seriously.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000
The other one on here was video game play is socially isolating.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:01.000
And the first sentence is, much video game play is social. Almost 60% of frequent gamers play with friends.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.000
33% play with siblings and 25% play with spouses or parents.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:16.000
8. Video game play is desensitizing. And, no. It's not.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.000
The Rob D. has a very funny comment in chat there. It says video game play is isolating.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.000
That's why I'm in a chat room with 40 other people and I've met a lot of them.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Talking about the various conventions and stuff.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Exactly.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
Funny. Funny.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
So, just more goes to show that, you know, there's idiots in power.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
So, another email?

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Yes. Last one.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Actually from the Rob D.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Alrighty.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
What's up, OLR hosts? Back at PAX.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Amongst the random conversation between bites of delicious food at Wild Ginger,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I mentioned that while I have friends that are into video games, I have no friends that are willing to make a podcast with me.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:59.000
That got me thinking. You've talked about the origins of OLR before, but were you all willing to give it a try right away?

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:07.000
As I recall, a couple of you had had previous radio experience, so that probably delayed a few of your initial worries about starting your own internet radio show.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Still, did any of you have to be talked into it?

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
One of us just showed up every show until we said, fine, you can join.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Yeah. Loki just kind of showed up, but that was cool.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:26.000
That was originally what it was supposed to be, is it was like the weekly gathering of people to talk about, you know, games, and specifically DDR back in the day of OLR's origins.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Let's continue. Did you imagine you'd still be doing it after all of this time?

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.000
No.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Yes. I thought we would.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
After this long...

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
I'm stubborn.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Since Understation Live ended, for me, I mean, obviously it's still going, but since it ended for me because of Travis' move, no, I didn't think this show would outlast Understation Live.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:52.000
I really didn't. But we've all, you're right, we've all been kind of stubborn and haven't gone anywhere.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:48:00.000
You know, we're still here in SAC and although our lives have all gone through significant changes, certainly, nobody's really left or, you know what I mean?

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So, I felt that I would keep, I would at least keep broadcasting in some way or another. That was...

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Honestly, I think that's part of the reason why Orange Laundry was started in the first place.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000
So, no, none of us had to be talked into it because you hit the nail on the head, we all kind of were doing it anyway.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:18.000
So, it was kind of like a chance for us to kind of talk about something.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:27.000
You know, I don't want to say that we wanted to talk about because we certainly had that outlet on Understation Live, but maybe something different that we felt we had a lot more to say, if that makes sense.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
I think it's kind of where this started.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Well, to continue, if I may.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Sure.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I was going to say, you may. Sorry. I've been listening to Rocky.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:38.000
You may.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:43.000
When did you know it was something that you wanted to continue doing?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I think it was just sort of, we just sort of kept doing it. I mean, it's not a conscious decision. Are we going to keep doing OLR?

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I think the moment that we had 12 listeners the first night and we were like, cool, somebody is actually listening to this.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
I think we've grown since the 12 listeners.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
A little bit, thanks to podcasting. Just a little bit, yeah.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Finally, were there any people you asked to host OLR that didn't want to do it?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:15.000
In other words, are there any lost OLR hosts or hosts that could have been?

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
No, it was always going to be Jamie and I.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:22.000
And then Loki came on after, you know, because he was so involved and so into it and was doing so much.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:25.000
I mean, it would be stupid not to add him, obviously.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Rob and I had a meeting.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000
I can't picture the show without him all these years later, honestly.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Rob and I actually did have a meeting.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Yes.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
And we were like, should we just make Loki a host?

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Yeah, that's pretty much how it went.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And lo and behold.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000
No, the idea, the concept kind of formed between Jamie and I and that's where it is.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
There was no really other host considered.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Guests, people, I think you've pretty much heard everybody we've wanted to have on the show.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
I want Igarashi.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
Well, I mean, you know what I mean, like local-wise and local other DDR peeps.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
We need to get Dan back on the show.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Yeah.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Okay, next paragraph.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
By the way, I just want to say real quick.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000
We also got another email in.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.000
VXChaseXV in chats, who's obviously been following us a long, long time, says the podcast specifically,

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:18.000
podcasting into the main show, I think that was when it really hit the ground running.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
OLR moved on from just Bomani to video games that don't suck and podcasting.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
That was the real time.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I admit, even the show does seem to have a different feel to it now, but it's a natural evolution.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:30.000
We got older.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000
We actually have a bit more structure.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.000
We didn't really talk about news much when we started.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
We just were pretty much talked about whatever we wanted to.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:45.000
And I had a migraine the first show, so I didn't know if that was any kind of sign.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:49.000
I was sitting in that chair with ice on my head.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Before they made Head On, there was ice on.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Nice.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
But next paragraph.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Also, what did you think about the Mega Man 9 downloadable content?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.000
On one hand, I will buy it and love that we're finally going to be able to play as Proto Man.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:11.000
On the other hand, things like the endless stage and the special stage make me worried that things we used to take for granted as unlockables,

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
extra stages, and characters are now being turned into pay-as-you-go items.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I know gaming is a business, and I appreciate that Capcom is in tune with the fans to put Proto Man in the game.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:24.000
I wish it didn't have to come at my expense.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Thanks, Rob D.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
P.S. Looks like I'll have to buy OE for Tatunoko vs. Capcom.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Sad. I can't pass it up.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Rob hit the nail on the head that this is kind of where we're seeing the industry going,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
is that now we're having to pay for things we used to just unlock for fun, which is sad.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
But I can't give an opinion on the Mega Man 9 download content because I haven't got it.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000
There's still unlockables.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
There are, but you know what I mean.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Rob, try the Proto Man thing. It's fun.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
I do. I want to check it out.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Or as he was originally called, blues.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Rob's apologizing for the long email.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Don't apologize.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
It was actually fun. It was a little bit retro.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
It gave us time to get another email.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
It did. Alright, quickly. I told somebody we'd be calling them in ten minutes.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Okay. It's actually from Sauce.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Sweet.

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It's a game review.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
We can make time for Sauce.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Yeah.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Hello all. A month after the Nintendo DS game Dragon Quest IV Chapters of the Chosen was released,

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I finally had the chance to finish playing through the game and give it a somewhat in-depth review.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Please. I want to know more about this, actually.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
I wound up playing the original Dragon Quest IV and then Chapters of the Chosen back to back

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.000
in order to compare the remake to the original, so I would better appreciate what the remake has to offer.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Overall, the game is as close to perfect as a classic RPG can be.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.000
It's definitely worth checking out for those who have played the original Dragon Quest IV

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:43.000
and those who have never played the game before alike.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
As always, the full review can be found on my blog at AvengersTower.com

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
or through my Twitter, Mar and Marvel.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Keep up the great job, OLR.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
I look forward to coming out to Sacramento again soon to see you all again.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000
And that's from Mar.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Yay! Whatever happened to her moving here?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
And I'm going to copy the link in the chat.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Is that still something that might happen?

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I hope. I wish.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I hope so too.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
It must happen.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Alright. We'll see. One of us. One of us.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Alright. Let's move on. We've got some BlizzCon news.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Yes.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
By the way, if you want to email us, mailbagorangelunchrated.com.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Some news coming out of BlizzCon.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Yes. First thing that came out of BlizzCon was the new class revealed for Diablo III.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
New class is Wizard.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Wizard!

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Yes.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Please tell me the game will say,

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Blue Wizard is about to die.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Wrong game.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Aw, dammit.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.000
But the wizard is blue.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Actually, the wizard was yellow and gauntlet, but never mind.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
The wizard is blue in this one.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Oh, okay. Well, cool.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Anyways, they didn't really say exactly too much about it other than the wizard can hurl lightning, can channel explosive arcane energies.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.000
It's a fucking wizard! What else do you need to know? I mean, seriously.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
It's a fucking wizard.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I mean, is it suddenly going to have a sword and shield? No, it's a wizard. Magic. End.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Right?

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
It would be a red wizard that would have a sword and shield there.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Shut up.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Yeah, that's it.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
There you go.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Well, also some other news about Diablo III. You know, people have been begging Blizzard to put World of Warcraft on consoles.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And what's interesting about Diablo III and some of the news that's come out about Diablo III is that possibly it could be coming to consoles.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I guess this was based off a very veiled comment that came out of BlizzCon, but you know what? Take it with a grain of salt.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:45.000
It's probably not going to happen right away. Because what was the last thing Blizzard did on a console?

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:51.000
The Viking game, right? And then Starcraft Ghost got aborted, so there really wasn't anything else.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
So Diablo III consoles? Probably not for a long time, folks.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
By the way, some other little tidbits out of BlizzCon.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
You will soon be able to use your mounts in the water in a future World of Warcraft patch.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Right now, if you try to run across a river on your mount, you will automatically dismount.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:11.000
And now your mounts will apparently work in the water, so you can try to drown your horse. Isn't that nice?

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
There you have it.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:20.000
By the way, to hear some other things about BlizzCon, we're actually going to get an old OLR buddy here on the phone who is actually at BlizzCon.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
We want to talk to them about their experience at BlizzCon, so we're giving them a call right now.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
One ringy dingy.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Two ringy dingys.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Hopefully he answers the phone.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Hello, is this Extopher?

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Yes.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Hello, Extopher. How are you?

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
I'm fine, and you?

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Ah, my mom.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Why? Why?

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Because I didn't go to BlizzCon like you, you asshole.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you know, I don't know what to do for that, but I did, so whatever.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Alright, well, how was BlizzCon? Tell us about the trip. What did you do? How was it? You know, walk us through your experience at BlizzCon.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Well, it was pretty cool. We got there a day before it started, and we picked up our bags, and it was kind of confusing how to pick up our goody bags.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Once we did, we got back to our hotel, kind of looked at it all, and there was a lot of stuff that was in there that they didn't list on the website, actually.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:41.000
They gave us a bunch of, everybody got a free authenticator that was BlizzCon's theme, so it has like a BlizzCon logo on it and everything.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Wait, you got a free authenticator? You fucker.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Well, yeah, we all got that.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000
What was that?

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:53.000
I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry, go ahead.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Oh, okay, I hate you too. So, yeah, and then we got there in the morning the next day, and pretty much watched the panels.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:10.000
We waited in line at the BlizzCon store for three hours before we got to the front of it.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Oh my God, what was so important that you had to get?

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Well, I wanted a shirt, and Annie, my sister, wanted also a shirt and one of their little messenger bags that they have.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:40.000
So, yeah, we waited really long for that, and then Jim, my brother-in-law, got my sister a Murloc, which was a big collectible thing this year, I guess.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:50.000
And so, it was pretty fun. There was a lot of panels, a lot of exciting, like, new things that we got to see.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:58:03.000
We got to see walkthroughs of four of the dungeons, and we also got to see Jay Moore again this year, which was fun.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I like that comment from Redertainment in chat right now. He says, I waited three hours and all I got was this fucking shirt.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
I know, that's what I said.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:28.000
What were some of the awesome things that happened at the panels? We talked about some of the news already a little bit on the show, how you can use your mounts and water, you'll be able to on one of the patches, but, like, what was something that happened at the panels that got a huge response from the crowd?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I think that, just, I don't know, like, it's very general, because a lot of things got big responses.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:48.000
When I was at the panels in particular, I was at the dungeons and raids panel, I was at half of the PVP panel.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:59:01.000
And I think that class balance is really a big issue on a lot of people's minds, is how are they going to balance the classes, especially with the Death Knights being the big, like, new class.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:20.000
And they kind of really validated everybody's concerns, which I think made everyone happy, and so I think everything that they said, every answer that they gave that had to do with class balance was particularly, like, good to hear for a lot of people.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:38.000
I don't know if we mentioned it on this show yet tonight, but I think we were talking about it a little bit with Bobby when we were doing the tease on the Bobby Black Wolf show before us here on All Games Radio, we were mentioning that some guy had a Diablo 3 shirt that actually worked for Blizzard that had, like, unicorns and rainbows on it, and it was a Diablo 3 shirt.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Did you see that shirt?

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Yeah.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I won it.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:59.000
No, I didn't see the shirt, but there was a funny thing that happened. During the closing ceremony, they actually showed that on the big screen. Like, they were making fun of Diablo 3, and then they showed it, and everybody just, like, lost it. It was crazy.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Awesome.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
But, yeah, it was fun.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Speaking of Diablo 3...

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000
By the way...

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:04.000
Go ahead.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Go ahead.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:15.000
Oh, I was gonna say, Patton Oswalt was incredibly funny. Like, he is great to see in person. Like, everybody loved him.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:18.000
Did he make a bunch of WoW jokes or something? Call you all nerds?

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:35.000
No, he actually, he's never played WoW in his life, but he put people down for making fun of him for that, and it was great. He, like, played off of the audience, like, so well, and he had a bunch of geek jokes, and he was not censored, which was great, so...

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Did you get to put your hands on any of the games that were on the floor? Because you had, like, Diablo 3, Starcraft 2.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Yeah.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
What'd you play?

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Well, last year I played Starcraft 2, and I'm not a big, like, real-time strategy, like, type of person, so I thought it was fine for what it was, but I did get a chance this year to play Diablo 3, and I was sold.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Like, it's definitely really fun. I've never played Diablo in my life before that, and it was absolutely wonderful. I definitely recommend it when it comes out.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Well, it's not even anywhere near finished yet, which makes it, like, even more incredible to me.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
What was the demo like? Like, what did you get to do in the demo?

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Well, you could choose your class, which there's only three playable classes right now, and after that you go into this, like, dungeon-y area, and basically my sister and my brother-in-law, we, all three of us, grouped up into a party, and we all three, like, just had fun, just kind of, like, mashing the buttons and seeing what abilities we could, you know, use or whatever.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:02:05.000
None of us had played the game before, so we didn't really know how to control it, so we were kind of noobs learning for the first time, but it was actually surprisingly easy, and there's a lot of different, like, creepy little enemies, and, I don't know, they're all, like, skeletal, and there's a lot of blood in it, and I don't know, it's like a dungeon-y type place.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Awesome. Well, any other, like, what would you say was the best thing about BlizzCon?

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:28.000
The best thing this year about BlizzCon was the contest ceremony. Jay Moore absolutely killed it, and I don't care if you don't like Jay Moore, I think he was hilarious, and he actually created a lot of new fans that night.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:53.000
And the actual dance contest was just the best, like, they had an undead female dance that, like, I don't know what it was, it, like, mesmerized everybody, just, the whole audience, like, went crazy, like, 5,000-whatever people that were in there were just, like, all cheering for this girl, so it was pretty cool.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Well, we have some questions from the chat room that I want to ask you. Retertainment is asking, did someone ask Jay Moore if his show was cancelled?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:12.000
You know, nobody got to ask Jay Moore anything, but I'm sure he'll have a cancelled show within the next few weeks or so.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:20.000
DJ Dark Knight wants to know, did you go to any of the tournaments that were going on?

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:44.000
We wanted to, but there was so much going on that we actually didn't. I kind of kept up to date on what was going on with the arena tournaments by looking on WoW Insider, like with my phone, which was kind of cool because I guess there was a huge upset this year, but it was, as far as I know, the area looked really cool, we got to walk by a few times.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Nice. Shahran, speaking of your phone, actually wants to know, how's your iPhone?

02:03:50.000 --> 02:04:01.000
It freaking rocks, I guess. I don't know. It's okay. I'm kind of over the iPhone, actually. I keep on telling people that I might actually switch to a different phone in November.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Why?

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:03.000
I don't know.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Really?

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:14.000
It's high maintenance, you know, you have to constantly clean it, and I don't know, I'm always worried that the screen is going to get scratched.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Whatever, you're just talking smack about it because I finally bought one this week.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
I know, and look at me trying to make you feel bad.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Last question, Dark Tetsuya wants to know if the Wizard was playable in Diablo 3.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:40.000
It was, and I actually played the Wizard, and it was really fun. I was very impressed. Once again, having not ever played the game before, I was thoroughly impressed by it.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:52.000
At least for anybody that hasn't played the game before, I definitely recommend it, and from what I hear, most fans of Diablo are definitely going to want to play this.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Alright, really quickly, then we're going to let you go, because this phone call is going on ten minutes, but I want to know, did you meet other, because it's a convention, it's a meet and meet people, did you meet any other funny people?

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Were there some really weird ass people that you actually got to meet?

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Well, there were weird ass people, but tell you the truth, Rob, I don't want to meet any of those weird fuckers.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Wasn't there somebody you were looking at from a distance going, that guy is, like, fucking weird?

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Yeah, especially the people that ask questions on the panels, like, they're the best, they're like, I'm a nerd, and I'm like, did he even ask a question? I don't know, do they speak different languages? What the hell?

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Alright, well, hey, Extrofer, we gotta let you go so we can get back to our show, but thanks for the report on Blizzcon, and maybe next year I can go.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Maybe, who knows?

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
We'll see, alright, well, take care, Extrofer, and come join us in the studio sometime.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
Alright, I will, definitely.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
Alright, later, dude.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Alright, bye.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:17.000
Extrofer joining us, not live, from Blizzcon, but at least he was there, so he was able to give us a call, which, by the way, while Blizzcon was going on, some friends of mine, and me, held our own little convention called QQCon, for those of us that weren't able to get tickets to Blizzcon, so it was pretty awesome, actually.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:23.000
We actually had goodie bags from QQCon, and one of the things we got was a little rabbit's foot for better luck next year, so there you have it.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Alright, let's move on and get to some more gaming news, and then we'll get to the Skype line so the rest of y'all can call in, and we'll start off Dark Sakura, going to a new game.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:40.000
For anyone who is interested in Call of Duty, Call of Duty 5 is going into beta next week for Xbox 360.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Well, I should actually say, this week.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:50.000
There will be some sources that are giving out beta codes, you just have to find them.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I just thought it was worth saying that Activision is starting testing now.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Cool. Kind of like last year, they did the same thing with Call of Duty 4.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
I remember I got into the beta last year, we only played it a few times.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I know that Eurogamer is giving out beta codes, so for our friends overseas, you can find it there.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Yeah. Hmm. Very cool.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Anyways, let's see here. Something back to the music gaming topic here.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:27.000
There's a brand new music game that's going to make some competition for Beatmania and Activision's new DJ hero.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:43.000
That is Scratch, the ultimate DJ, being announced. It's kind of a partnership of both Newmark and hip-hop producer Quincy Jones III.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Genius Products is going to be distributing it, and Genco Interactive, I believe, is developing it.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:56.000
The game itself is very similar to Beatmania, in fact the screen basically involves

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:02.000
five colored notes scrolling down the screen, and they've got a section where you can scratch as well.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
There's going to be a controller that they're making for it.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Actually, Newark is making the controller, and overall, it looks pretty cool so far.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:18.000
We'll have to see more of a song list and that kind of thing, but maybe set the bar a little bit high for a DJ hero whenever that comes out.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
But this, I don't know, looks pretty cool.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.000
ActDeft in chat gives a mandatory comment. Konami will sue! Will they? Yeah, they may.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:32.000
They may sue, and you know what, that's pretty sad because their attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.000
And this is J100Matt says, how can they not be sued for this?

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:45.000
Because the interface is different. I mean, it is a similar type of gameplay, but depends on how you play it.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:51.000
I mean, it's just like how Guitar Hero is different enough to where they can't really sue.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Well, I guess, they license the rights for the guitars, but as far as the actual game itself, I don't think they have to license anything.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:11.000
So, it's different enough, the way the notes come on the screen, because they kind of come out, it looks like there's a record that's playing that is spinning,

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:16.000
and then the notes come out of the spinning record and then scroll down the screen, like a conveyor belt.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:22.000
FYI, VXChasingXV argues with you and says, Konami's attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:26.000
15 versions in Japan, their US attempt was great, it's just the wrong locale.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I'm talking about the US one, and yeah, it was alright, but what did they really do with it?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Nothing. So, you know what, if you're not going to do anything with your product that could probably sell very well,

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:48.000
much like Guitar Freaks was, then you deserve to be left in the dust, I guess.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Just like putting out a guitar game and a drum game years after everyone else has attempted it. Not probably a smart idea.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I reluctantly agree, I have no patience for Konami in the music game world anymore.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
If they're not going to do it, someone else needs to beat them to it.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Although I thought Beatmania in the US was fine, it was alright.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Well, let's look at DDR. What exactly has changed in DDR lately? Not much.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
How have they supported their games with downloadable content? Not very well.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I mean, the quest mode in that game, in the universe games have sucked,

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:33.000
and they don't really listen to their fanbase anymore, they just kind of do what they want because they're DDR and people will buy it.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Universe 3 looks kind of cool. People will buy it for a while.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:42.000
Alright, speaking of DDR, there is another DDR game coming out.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000
It is Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves, and it's coming for the Wii.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000
It's what it sounds like, it's going to be 40 new Disney songs that are going to be coming to the Wii.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:59.000
You know, the standard press release comes out with this, that apparently you can actually get your Mii in a Disney costume,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
and that's what you can dance with in the game.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Apparently there will be some new modes too, like a groove world, where it basically just has achievements and you get costumes based on the achievement.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Now, what is also cool is the way the community actually tore apart the DDRX disc and found some extra song names on the disc.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
There's like this master track list that's always in DDR games.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Ah yes, the master track list, and you would think by now that they would have learned.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000
Well, they hacked the master track list and they found a bunch of new songs on it, and guess what, they're all Disney songs.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
So you can pretty much already tell what songs are going to be in this.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:47.000
A Pirate's Life, Chim Chim Marie, Disney Carnival, Hakuna Matata, I Just Can't Wait To Be King, Mickey Mouse Club March, The Bare Necessities, Zippity Doodah,

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:59.000
and the most awesome Disney song of all time, The Tiki Room.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Come on, you could be able to dance to that, right? Can't you see yourself dancing to that?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Tell me the Tiki Room isn't the most awesome Disney song of all time.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
The Tiki Room is the best place to go when it's hot.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:18.000
The question is, why do you see a song called Ducks In The Hood? Don't ask.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000
I mean, Ducks In The Hood, really?

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Well, those are some of the songs you have to look forward to. By the way, that wasn't the actual Tiki Room recording, that was just something I found.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
It was actually the Tiki Room Macarena version, but it's very dancey.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Macarena's cool again, it's retinal occasionally.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Ice Mickey? Wow, Way To Be Current.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Alright, where's Macho Duck? What the fuck? I mean, seriously.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
Let's move on with other awesome game news.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000
I have to actually make a comment about that. It better have freaking dance magic in it.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
I haven't heard. We'll see.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Rob did have to give me a story that I'm going to completely not give a shit about.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
What is that?

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:10.000
The fitty game, Blood On The Sand, is going to be published by THQ.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Activision farted on the idea and said, we don't want this pile of steaming shit.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:21.000
So THQ said, wait, we like shit?

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:28.000
To be fair, it doesn't look bad. It's just over the top and with no base in reality whatsoever.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I mean, if they made Oscars for video games, this would so be nominated next year.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Well, it's coming out sometime.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Phew, rest easy. Thank you THQ for giving the gamers.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Thank you THQ for our fitty.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Well, I don't know, they have like 50 Cent and these games sell.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Exactly, it'll sell.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
You'd be surprised.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
You'd be surprised, I know, I know.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:01.000
A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Well, the new Xbox Experience brand new update that's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Everybody's been wondering, when the hell is this thing coming out?

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Well, hopefully we have your answer now.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:22.000
It was announced during Tokyo Game Show that it will be available to download on November 19th.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
So that's when you get your brand new Xbox Experience.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:33.000
The download will take up 128 megabytes of hard drive space or storage space.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
People have been concerned and kind of in an uproar about,

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Well, you know, why is it going to require space?

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:42.000
There are some 360s that are sold without storage.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Well, I correct you.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.000
There are no Xbox 360s currently being sold without storage of any kind.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:54.000
If you remember, the arcade systems do come with a 256 megabyte memory unit.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:15:02.000
So you can still enjoy the next Xbox Experience, I guess.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.000
And if you don't have a fucking memory card or hard drive, I mean, seriously, what the hell's wrong with you?

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Just buy a hard drive.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Then you probably don't care about the new Xbox Experience either.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Honestly.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Although I do still think it was a mistake for Microsoft to just not put the hard drive with all the systems.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
They wanted to drive the price down, whatever.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Whatever, I mean, it's fine.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
The other thing that's rumored to be coming out on the 19th as well,

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Well, apparently Home may be coming out that day as well to kind of counteract the whole new Xbox Experience.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:37.000
And it makes perfect sense to me, because even if it's not done, they're going to release it anyways.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.000
Because it's still in beta.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:43.000
Yeah, beta. Awesome.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.000
So yeah, expect that probably around the same time as well.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Alright. Are you looking forward to the new Xbox Experience? I think it looks pretty cool.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Yeah, don't really care.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:16:01.000
There is one thing I'm looking forward to about it, is that they are going to add new 16x10 screen formats.

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:12.000
So, for example, if I'm playing on my monitor that's 1400x900, I can actually use the full screen now.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Because before it was kind of stretched a little bit, but now it'll actually be the no native resolution for widescreen monitors.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Cool.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Alright, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype line.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And this is a pretty interesting story.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
There is actually a study that has gone on out there.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.000
It's a bisexual psychoth- actually, it's not so much a study more than it is just kind of a comment.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It's bisexual psychotherapist Paula Hall, and she said this to the BBC.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Apparently, according to this Paula Hall, she was actually doing this whole study on premature ejaculation was actually what the study was all about.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Yes, that's what I said, premature ejaculation.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.000
And you might be thinking, what the hell does this have to do with video games?

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:59.000
Well, it's because of an interesting comment she actually said as a part of this.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:09.000
These men with non-psychological premature ejaculation have very quick reflexes.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:14.000
They may be excellent at playing tennis or computer games.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:23.000
So apparently, according to this chick, there's some type of correlation between being a good gamer and finishing quickly in the bedroom.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Maybe it's because they're just waiting to get back to the game.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
That doesn't make any sense.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
I don't blame Paula Hall.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I don't know. That still doesn't make any sense.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Apparently, what they're trying to do with this whole thing, they're trying to actually make drugs to reduce the likelihood of premature ejaculation, like Viagra in reverse, I guess, a little bit.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Very interesting.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000
I wonder if this is a problem for women.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Premature ejaculation.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
You know what?

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
What?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:57.000
The problem for women is men.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Men are impatient.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Okay, I'm done. Back to the game. Thanks, lady.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
You know what else is the problem too?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
What?

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Women keep nagging them when they're trying to play their games.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Honey, come to bed.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000
That's why God made toys.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
All right.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Moving forward.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Yes, please. We're going to go to the Skype line.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:21.000
We're going to go to our phones.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
And hey, we've got a call on the line.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Hello, caller, are you there?

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Yep.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Hey, who is this?

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
Hello, Rice Princess.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Hello, Rice Princess. How are you?

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Oh, I'm okay. How are you?

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I'm good. We're hearing from a lot of local OLR folks tonight,

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:49.000
because I don't know if you heard, but Ecstifer was on the show earlier talking about BlizzCon.

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Oh, boo, BlizzCon.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Well, what did you call in to tell us about tonight?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
I went to a CoolerCon.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Well, you went to a CoolerCon this week. Did you go to Tokyo Game Show?

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
No. Why would I go to that crap?

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.000
You went to a con that was cooler than Tokyo Game Show and BlizzCon combined?

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Where did you go?

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.000
Yeah, I went to QQCon.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Awesome. QQCon. I went to QQCon, too. I think I saw you there.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
I mean, there was a lot of people there, but I think I saw you in the crowd.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Yeah, I think I ran across you once or twice.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.000
I think so. Tell the listeners something about QQCon, because I bet nobody's ever heard of QQCon.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000
But did you have something to do with the starting of QQCon?

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.000
No, it was actually organized by two of our friends, Mel and Eric.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:43.000
But we just actually held it at our venue, aka our apartment.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And yeah, it's just awesome and free.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Free? That's awesome. Tell the listeners a little something about the idea behind QQCon.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Why was there a QQCon? What were we celebrating at QQCon?

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Oh, okay. Well, you know how there was BlizzCon this weekend?

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:10.000
And a lot of us didn't get to go because they had this ridiculous lottery system to have to get tickets and stupid crap like that.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:13.000
We just kind of had our own convention.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:18.000
And it's the QQCon because, as we all know, QQ means crying in the game.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:21.000
Because the QQs look like crying eyes.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:27.000
So we were all just basically convening to cry about not going to BlizzCon.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Was there any cosplay at the tournament, or at the convention, as SSG100Matt?

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:39.000
There was no cosplay, but we all got swag in the form of Frostmourne.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:45.000
And we all welded them and played around with them and stuff.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Does that count?

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Will there be a QQCon next year?

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Absolutely. There would be one every year from here on out.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:02.000
I think what would be awesome is that even if the organizers were able to get into BlizzCon next year, there should still be a QQCon.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Because what is a convention without bitching about something that happened at the convention?

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Of course. We would just have it in the hotel or something.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Exactly. So everybody's invited to the second annual QQCon next year.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:24.000
We might have to find a larger venue according to how many people actually find up for next year's QQCon.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
Well this is how these things start.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Yeah, we'll have to see about that.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000
Alright, sounds good.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Hey, any other video games you've been playing this week you want to tell our listeners about?

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Um, no.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Well alright then.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:42.000
I didn't play anything except for WarioWare at QQCon because it's the best con ever.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
But that's pretty much it.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Um, yeah, you have to poop at QQCon.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
I had YYCon.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
You did?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
What's YYCon?

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Why? Why? It means yay.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Yes, I did have to poop at QQCon.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It's going to be an event next year. Alright, I'm hanging up. This joke's gone on way too long.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Bye Rice Princess!

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Bye.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000
Bye. Did she just poop in the phone? I think she did.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I don't think that was a poop. I think it was a fart.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Hi, this is Spaz.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Hey, what's up Spaz?

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Uh, not much. Um, I just want to comment on something that you were saying earlier in the show.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Yes.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:38.000
If I remember right, you were mentioning that you're considering playing PlayStation 3.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
The what? I'm sorry?

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:46.000
If I remember right, you had mentioned that you're considering getting a PlayStation 3?

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Yeah, I think it's past the point of consideration. I think it's going to happen. It's just a question of when.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Well, you know, I think that if you do get it, you'll really enjoy it. The only thing to bear in mind is that it would be a good idea to compare it to the 360 in any way.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Because it's kind of, in its own way, its own beast. If you try to compare it to the 360, you'll probably come off disappointed.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:28.000
What kinds of cool things am I going to find on the PlayStation 3 that I'm not going to get on the Xbox 360, in your opinion?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Well, there's, as you probably know, there's not a whole lot of system exclusives in terms of games.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:50.000
But what few there are, I think you may like stuff like Solcom, Warhawk, some of the downloadable original PlayStation 1 games.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:59.000
They do have some interactive art there. In fact, I was just talking about one with Bobby Blackwell on his show.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:07.000
And the most recent one is kind of weird, but it's still interesting nonetheless.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And then, of course, there's the whole Pixeljunk series of games, including Pixeljunk Monsters, which is kind of like a tower defense game, which is pretty fun.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I could go on and on in terms of games, but I don't want to take up too much time on the show.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:44.000
And plus, there's one benefit to the PlayStation 3's video store that the 360 doesn't do all well, in the sense that with the 360, you can only rent the movies,

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000
whereas the PlayStation 3 gives you the choice between renting or outright buying.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Some people are kind of against renting, they would really buy, because once you see the movie, you're basically out a couple bucks,

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:14.000
whereas if you're outright buying the movie, you can't watch it as many times as you want whenever you want.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Well, but doesn't the PlayStation 3 kind of do both? Don't they have Blu-ray and a download service now?

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Yeah, that's absolutely right. Basically, you have a choice. Blu-ray is a little bit more expensive, but at the same time, you get all the extras.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:45.000
It's in high-def, and since it's on the desk, it won't take up any space on your hard drive.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Whereas if you buy from the download service, you won't get the extras, and if you buy the movies, they'll be in standard definition, but you'll get a cheaper price point.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Fair enough, but Blu-rays are kind of expensive. I mean, you have to really like a movie in order to want to get it on Blu-ray.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000
You know what I mean? They're like 24 bucks a pop. That's a lot more than a rental.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Well, actually, it may be 24 bucks in and around the area, but at least in my area, which is western New York,

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:29.000
they're closer to, on the cheap end, like 30 bucks, and as high as 35.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:34.000
Hey, speaking of high-def movies, I was just in the house because I had to run and make a potty break while another story was going on.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.000
They're actually using the HD DVD player right now. They're watching Stardust, which I love that movie.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:46.000
Anyway, sorry, just kind of a random tangent, but hey, that movie was actually pretty cheap because HD DVD had already bit the dust at that point when I got that.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Question from Frisbee in chat, and this will be the last one, and then we're going to get to one more call before we end the show tonight.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Frisbee wants to know, is Blu-ray really that good?

02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Well, in my opinion, yes. To give an analogy in terms of games, it's kind of like trying to play Halo 3 as opposed to the original NES version of Washington Attack.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And that's in terms of graphics, not in terms of fun or anything like that.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Halo 3 is at least a balance better than Washington Attack in terms of graphics.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:46.000
I think a big part of it, too, is that it's kind of like watching HDTV for the first time compared to regular TV.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:56.000
I mean, true DVDs are a little slightly better than regular TV, like the old TVs, because they can do interlaced, but it's a big step.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Well, anyway, Spaz, we've got to wrap up, but do you have any quick last thoughts for our listeners?

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Oh, yeah. Obviously, I can't do it now, but probably during the week if you like, I can send you an email with a list of recommended games and whatnot that gives me joy.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000
I'll always take a look, Spaz. You can email that to me anytime.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Sure. Have a good one.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
All right, you have a good one. Take care, buddy.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
All right, you too. Bye-bye.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Bye-bye. We'll do one more call here on the Skyline 1877 Game OLR.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. It is he who is very uncreative and can't think of a way of describing himself tonight.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:38.000
How about you just call yourself Jason?

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Yeah, that works, too. Hey, guys, it's Jason.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Hey, how you doing?

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Hey, it's so funny. You can totally tell the difference between the telephone calls and the Skype calls. The Skype calls really are pretty clear.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
The Internet takes off for phones pretty soon.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
That's all right. Hey, what's on your mind, Jason?

02:28:52.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I don't remember all of the details specifically. I was driving into work and my iPhone tuner app was cutting out, so I didn't get all of the conversation.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Oh, my God. I keep forgetting that people can actually listen to this show in the car now because of Edge. That is nuts.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:15.000
We plug it straight into the car stereo and when 3G decides to actually work properly, I can just be listening to whatever I want, in this case, the show.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:23.000
That is amazing. Technology has come so far. You're going to have to tell me how you do that. I don't know if you're looking at Justin.TV. I just finally picked up the iPhone this week.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:30.000
All I have is Twitterrific and I got Tap Tap Revolution or whatever it's called, Tap Tap Mania.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
It's a terrible game.

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Yeah, it's a little stupid.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I hated that game.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:44.000
The frame rate, well, it's free. I can't complain about free. But what's weird is that it's what they advertise in the Apple store on the big banners, which I thought was interesting.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I'll complain about free. Yars sucked and so does Tap Tap Revenge.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:57.000
All right, sorry. Brad is sending me a private message for the tuner app. I'm going to definitely have to check that out. Wow. Man, it blows my mind how far technology has come.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
I don't like tuner.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Is there other ones that are good?

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:06.000
I've actually just been using AOL radio to listen to the comedy channel.

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
But you can't hear us on there.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.000
But tuner for a while stopped picking us up. Actually, they limited all the stations.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.000
And so correct me if I'm wrong, this is all free. It's not going to cost me extra money on the AT&T daily.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Tuner costs. AOL radio is free.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.000
But I mean, the bit rate, the data, the bandwidth is free.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:22.000
They shouldn't.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Oh my god, that's amazing.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:28.000
The iPhones only sell unlimited data plans, right?

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Yeah, they do. It just blows my mind though.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
And it can be used for the application or the service.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000
It just blows my mind.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
It's just your phone streaming the station.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Wow. Anyhow, sorry. I'm going to have to try that later.

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:42.000
It just blows my mind that somebody could be actually listening to us in the car right now.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Seven years ago, when we only had twelve listeners, I never thought that possible.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:53.000
But we really are starting to reach that day and age where you will be able to listen to us like an over the air wave show.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:57.000
We're there. It's just not many people are doing it. It's crazy.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:02.000
If Sprint actually kicks into high gear and really gets WiMAX everywhere, then it's going to be a really good day.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Because then PSPs and all of the other non-cellular network but wireless capable devices are going to be able to do the same thing just about anywhere.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:13.000
Anyway, I'm sorry. You probably didn't call in to talk about Tuner.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Oh, I don't care. I love technology. Are you kidding me? If you guys were a tech show, I'd be on here all the time.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Let me guess. You probably had something to say about the beat and groovy or beat meaning.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Because we've been talking a lot about music games tonight.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Beat and groovy is a joke.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I was going to say two things. That was going to be the shorter of two things.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:32.000
I reiterate what I said before, but I make it worse.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Konami needs to stop releasing in America.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:40.000
They're not going to hold a candle to what every other company has now done.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:49.000
And while I think Scratch looks really terrible, it's probably going to perform better, look better, and work better than BeatMania US, quite unfortunately.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:52.000
And it's probably going to do better because of the music choice.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:55.000
They never should have closed Hawaii.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
And they never should have moved Konami SoCal.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Nope.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Or NorCal, whichever.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:06.000
And a lot of us gave Konami Hawaii a lot of shit when that first DDR game came out on Xbox, but boy did the second one shut us all up.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
It seemed like they, more than any other division, were really listening to people.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000
I thought we gave them shit because they released DDRPC.

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:19.000
But without DDRPC, we would have never had Mr. Spanky. So, case in point.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Anyhow, sorry. What else besides beat and groovy? Beat and yucky.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Both of you and Loki were pretty wrong on StarCraft II.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:37.000
The way that they're veiling this, if I'm understanding correctly, I'm seeing two sides to the story, but neither of your opinions matched it.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
So here's my take.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:50.000
The release date is, I don't know if this has actually been mentioned, but the release date for the three StarCraft IIs is probably going to be on the same day or very, very close together, isn't it?

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.000
I haven't the clue. I didn't follow BlizzCon that closely, but okay.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:00.000
I don't think it's been announced. It's just the fact that it's going to be a trilogy and that's what everybody's going over.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:10.000
The same thing that Bobby was saying, and I'll do it in the same way as him, you're going to buy one game three times, you're going to buy one game three times, and you will buy one game three times.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:17.000
He's absolutely correct. They are going to take one game, give the same features on all three to play with other people.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:20.000
That's a good feature. I'm glad they're doing that.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:25.000
But the campaigns that they're splitting that up like that is pretty annoying.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:32.000
I'm hoping they... PC games, mainstream PC games come out at like $40 or $50, don't they?

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Yeah, that's about right.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
I don't play PC games anymore.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Spore was $49, right?

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Yeah.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.000
$49.99 for Spore. The price tags... I still have the box here and the price tag still on there, so I would expect that's the price you're going to...

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000
You can't see that on Justin. I would expect that's the price you're going to pay for StarCraft.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I'm hoping and assuming that they're going to make it a little bit cheaper, because $150 just to play a game that presumably you'll want to complete, paying $150 is going to be excessive.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:08.000
And I'm really hoping that each game is going to be... $25 and $30 even makes it a little bit better.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Cheaper than that would be great, but I'm seriously hoping that all three do not come out at $50 apiece.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:21.000
But if one does multiplayer... I mean, there's a bunch of people that only play StarCraft for multiplayer. I mean, the hell with single player.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:29.000
As a matter of fact, this is the funny thing. A couple of months ago, I finally got StarCraft to work on OSX. I have a MacBook Pro, by the way.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Yay!

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Anyways, I finally got StarCraft to work on my Mac, and I've been playing through it. I've been playing the campaign and nothing else.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:45.000
The real rub is I'm playing without cheats, because I've never done that. But I'm playing through the campaigns and nothing else.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Especially now that StarCraft II is coming out, I want to keep doing that.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:58.000
And all three of the races, I don't prefer the Terrans, but that doesn't mean I don't want to play their campaign.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:04.000
The story in the first one was magnificent, and I want to play that the whole way through.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Probably multiple times based off what I'm hearing they're doing.

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:13.000
I'm very curious to see, because Blizzard's pretty in tune with their fanbase. I'm very curious to see how they kind of respond to the negativity.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000
Because you know they will this week. We'll have a follow-up on this.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:21.000
I'm really hoping that they do it for cheaper, because it would make sense, and they're very good at that.

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Alright. Well, Jason, we've got to wrap up and get the show on out of here, but do you have any last thoughts?

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Your Netflix achievement was hilarious, and I want to see it happen.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.000
Thank you. And if you have no idea what we're talking about, you'll have to listen to Bobby's show. So there's a plug for Bobby.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:40.000
There's a plug for Bobby. Do it. Call GameStop on iTunes. Podcast.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:36:06.000
And while you're there, leave us a nice review too. By the way, I've got to say, speaking of the iTunes reviews, and if you don't already know, you can leave reviews on iTunes, and it really helps in the ranking of the show, and it gets it a little higher in the list the more people find us. It helps spread the word.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:15.000
The only name I've seen around is Let's Have Tea. It would fit. And they say, I've been listening to orange on the radio for a few years now, and still today, I've yet to find a podcast that's nearly the same feel as OLR does.

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:23.000
After a few episodes, you'll begin to feel like these people are your friends, rather than your entertainers. Half of that is because the show is made up of three people who are good friends outside the show.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Aww. Doesn't that give you warm fuzzies all over? Make you a little nauseous? Aww. So anyway, sorry. We love the positive reviews.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Absolutely. All right. Jason, we've got to let you go to wrap up, okay? Bye-bye. I don't think you can hear me.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Guys. Oh, see you. Bye. That was kind of an awkward end. All right. Yeah. The Rob D says, gives you warm fuzzies until someone's outside your door asking to hang out.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:59.000
Well, that's why we always say that, hey, we're based out of Sacramento, but that's about all we tell you. It's a big place. Over a million people.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:05.000
All right. Anyhow, hey, we've got to wrap up the show. It's that time. Before we wrap up, though, some quick last minute stories.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.000
I actually want to start tonight. Tiger Claw sent me this link, and I thought it was pretty funny.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Microsoft is suing DHL. You know who DHL is? They're kind of like FedEx, UPS, but they're like number three, I think.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Where they hire convicts.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Well, here's the thing. Well, apparently it's come to a head there, because DHL lost 21,600 Xbox consoles.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Damn.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Well, here's the thing. A train derailed in Texas. So because of the train derailment.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
It derailed right into my garage.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.000
This is everything. Again, this is coming from a lawsuit. It's been filed in Seattle, of course. That's where Microsoft's based.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Two million dollars in damages from DHL is what they want. It's because of two containers of Xbox consoles that had impact damage, wedding, pilfering, and storage.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:49.000
And the train derailed around Duke, Texas. So suddenly there's tons of Xbox users in Texas.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
If only it were Duke Nukem, Texas.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:58.000
By the way, this happened on October 13, 2007. So it was quite some time ago, but the legal stuff is slow right now.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
So there you have it.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:04.000
By the way, usually you would just go, well, it's an accident. Why are they being so mean?

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Nope. They are saying in the lawsuit that a DHL has not compensated it for the loss and that the delivery service, again, according to the lawsuit, quote,

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:24.000
negligently breached its duties as a common carrier, handler, bailey, warehouseman, agent, or in its other capabilities.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:28.000
So they're basically saying, you done fucked up and ruined all our Xboxes because of it.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:31.000
And so that's why they were so short on Xboxes a year ago.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
There you have it.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Anyhow, the Rob D. speaks up in chat and says, someone wet on two containers of 360 controllers, keep those 360s out of the bathroom.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:50.000
I knew that was a bad idea. I think when they fell out of the train, they got in the rain in Spain on the plane.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Yes, I do, actually. Sure, what's up?

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Alright, a bunch of interesting stuff.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:07.000
First off, XNA games are showing up on Xbox Live, apparently now. I have yet to go actually check this out, but apparently they started launching them.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I think that's what the last update was, remember? They had a live down for a day or so and they were tweaking some shit.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Alright.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:23.000
But anyways, apparently there are some errors popping up right now, but it says there's two titles seem to be unplayable to average users.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:29.000
With XNA Creators Club launcher errors popping up even if you have the program installed.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I don't know, so maybe it's something coming, but apparently they had both a free demo and the full versions priced at 100 Microsoft points.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:41.000
100 Microsoft points ain't a lot.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:40:00.000
Shown at Tokyo Game Show, Noby Noby Boy, which has the most weird video I've ever seen. It's basically, I don't even know how to describe the gameplay, but it has a really crazy song that fits in with Katamari Damacy.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Definitely check out the video, it's weird. I don't even know what this is. It's gotta be a Playstation Network title because it looks too simple for an actual full release game.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Left 4 Dead, the demo has been confirmed to be coming out early November, so that'll be fun to check out on Xbox 360 and PC.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:34.000
Also, another demo that's been kind of confirmed, Mirror's Edge, apparently coming November 6th. This has actually been revealed via GameStop's website because on their little bonus offer thing there it says,

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:40.000
on a special note, Mirror's Edge demo will be available for download November 6th. Interesting.

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Lots of Xbox Live Arcade games announced at Tokyo Game Show, lots and lots and lots of stuff.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:55.000
King of Fighters 98, there's gonna be a brand new Arkanoid game coming to live.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:00.000
Oh yeah, and the Space Invaders game, I'm so excited about the Space Invaders game, seriously.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:08.000
Space Invaders Extreme. Joining that will be Metal Slug 7, the game that was supposedly only for the DS.

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:19.000
A brand new R-Type game, R-Type Dimensions, which looks pretty awesome, and like I said before, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match will be coming as well.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:25.000
And no word exactly on when, but man, there's a lot of good stuff in the tubes here.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Let's talk more about R-Type. R-Type Dimensions is actually going to be recreating R-Type 1 and 2, so that's pretty cool.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:44.000
Other games coming out, Dodon Pachi, and I guess that came out in Japan only, but I don't even know if that's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Oh man, they have some screens for the new R-Type game, looks awesome. Awesome, awesome. And let's see, I know I've got a lot more here, sorry.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:06.000
There's a new t-shirt that was shown at Tokyo Game Show for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. Pretty cool, I think Jimmy would like that.

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:18.000
What was I going to say here? I gave Rob a video for this. They announced, remember that Rock Band reality show?

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:27.000
Well apparently, Rock Band To The Stars will be premiering on VH1 Classic this month, and there's a little promo video for it.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Not really sure what it is, but it says, on October 15th, VH1 Classic will premiere a new reality show called Rock Band To The Stars.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:48.000
It will feature Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach as they play host to 12 wannabe rockers as they live in a mansion and compete in different Rock Band 2 competitions.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
Here you go, courtesy of EW.com.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Welcome to Rock Band To The Stars. This is about Rock Band 2.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:04.000
Two legendary frontman, Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper, will choose their ultimate Rock Band bands from a pool of 15 rabid Rock Band masters.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:14.000
Each week, the players will face grueling challenges and painful eliminations to find out who rules in all things Rock Band 2.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:20.000
Rock Band To The Stars premieres this Wednesday during jumpstart videos, only on VH1.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Looks a little silly. Looks very low budget. Very, very low budget. What does TV come to?

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
I don't know.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
I get it. It's a little play on words there.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Yeah. Another funny thing, you know how they have in-game advertising for different things.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:46.000
EA has a lot of it. Well, Burnout Paradise apparently has Barack Obama banners now on their billboards.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Very interesting advertising, by the way.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:57.000
And apparently there's a rumor that IGN let slip a new Wii channel. I think we may have talked about this briefly last week.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
You know how there was that Bandbrothers DX channel?

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Well, they're saying that maybe there's a new channel coming out for Guitar Hero to use your DS on the Wii.

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:07.000
So it's kind of similar to that, but with Guitar Hero.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Huh. That's kind of cool.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:21.000
And then, let's see here. One thing I thought would be funny to mention, Rob, there's a video advertising Dookapon Kingdom.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:27.000
And the one thing that they do show advertised on there is they name their character Sassy Pants.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Awesome! What game was this?

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Dookapon Kingdom.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.000
They took it from me. That's my WoW character name, by the way. Sassy Pants.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:37.000
And that's it.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Dark Sakura? Anything on your neck of the woods?

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.000
No.

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:49.000
Alright. Oh, we just got this in. Late-breaking news. This is kind of a follow-up to the whole DHL and Microsoft thing going on.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Well, DHL has released its defense as to why all the Xboxes got wet.

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Gotta blame it on something, guys.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Come on, Microsoft.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Don't put the blame on us, Microsoft.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.000
It's not like we got out the hose.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:35.000
Why can't they just own up to it, okay?

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:38.000
No, this is so stupid.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:53.000
I don't give a shit. Whatever their fucking reason is, while it's in their hands, it's in their care, therefore their responsibility, you fucking own up.

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Whatever.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:01.000
And you know what Microsoft would say to you, Dark Sakura?

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Girl, you know it's true. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so you can put the nail in the coffin of this program.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:22.000
My final thought is lots of games to play, and there's a lot more coming.

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Meh.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:28.000
My final thought tonight is peanut butter.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:31.000
And that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:34.000
Hey, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:39.000
If you like what you hear, please consider leaving us a nice review on iTunes or just telling friends about the show.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Because really, word of mouth is how this word of our station travels.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000
And you know, it's the number one way we get new listeners to our show.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:53.000
So please, since we do it for free and don't really burden you with commercials or any of that stuff, consider telling some folks about the show.

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:59.000
That's going to do it. We will see you next week for episode number 299 of Orange Launch Radio, if you can believe it.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Sweet shit.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:05.000
All right. I know. We'll be back. See you then.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:08.000
