Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, October 19th, 2008

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
LittleBigPlanet generates some big controversy

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
Download content comes to SoulCalibur 4 that will surprise no one

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
And could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 soon be re-released?

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm sorry to hear that

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
I guess we'll have some good rants tonight

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Careful Chat

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I didn't do it, did I?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
You love me, right?

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
It's groups of people

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Maybe we'll catch on a little bit about what's going on later

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
If I don't feel better about it by then

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Alright, we'll see

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Also, say hello to the one and only Loki

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Hello

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
How are you, Techmaster? Loki?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm fine

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Are you having a good week?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Yes

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Are you mad at certain groups of people too?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Maybe

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You're perpetually mad at somebody

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
No, I'm just kidding

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Alright, I feel fine

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm having a good week

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm not really mad at anybody

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Well, I guess that's a lie

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm mad at some people

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
But I look past it

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
For the sake of the show

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Where we talk about just the games

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
And kick them back and have a little bit of fun

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
And in order to talk about the games

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
We gotta talk about our gaming weeks

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
And what we've been doing lately

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
If you want to join us

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
chat.orangelandradio.com

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Is where we are reading comments from you guys

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
In our chat room

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
On this lovely Sunday evening

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
As we always do when we tape live

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Alright, let's start off

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
DarkSakura

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
How was your gaming week?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I played Rock Band 2 and Ragnarok Online

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
How was Rock Band 2?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
It was very good

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Yeah?

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
What is your instrument of preference in Rock Band 2?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't have one

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
You like to play a little bit of everything?

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I really don't prefer to play

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh, you like to watch?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
No, my shoulder hurt

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
And I was in a lot of pain

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
So they made me play bass on a song

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Gotcha

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Alright, well, hey

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
How did you like it compared to the first one?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I saw no difference

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
It's more Rock Band

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah, more

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
More songs, I mean, that was okay

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
But, you know, I wasn't

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
It wasn't anything to be impressed or

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Displeased over

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
It was just more Rock Band

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Alright

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Well, if there's nothing else

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Then we'll move on to Loki

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
How was your gaming week?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Hi

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Oh, the clothes in it suck

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Better Barbie mode in the first game

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Well, they actually still have some of the same

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Clothes from the first game and the second game

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Didn't really add that much

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The GWAR outfits were kind of neat

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Let's see, this week I played

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Singing Zero 2, actually

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'm thinking about

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Almost 50% done with the game

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
It says I'm only like 37%

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Or maybe it's 47% done

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Basically, I've gone through two of the gangs already

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
I've finished the Brotherhood and the Son of Samedi

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
And

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
That was a weird gang

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
And then finally now I'm starting to run in a little bit

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
And

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I don't know, it's pretty cool

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I still think, though, out of the three gangs so far

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
The Brotherhood have been

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I think that storyline was the most brutal that was in it

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Played a little bit of the multiplayer

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
And they actually have a game mode

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
That's pretty awesome

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It kind of mixes up

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Different modes of the single player game

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Some of the activities it can do with multiplayer

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
So basically it's team based

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
You start off and you have about a minute

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
That's just pure deathmatch

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
And then an activity will start

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
So the first game I played, there was a mayhem activity

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
So basically

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
You have to go and destroy as many things as possible

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Just the environment, cars, other people, etc.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And so we did that

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And then after about, say, five minutes or so

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
The activity stops

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And then there's a break in between it

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Like another minute where it's just a deathmatch

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And then a new activity will start

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And then the new activity, I think, was insurance fraud

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
So we had to throw ourselves in front of cars and stuff like that

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Or you can hit your own teammates and you get points for that

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
But all along, while this is going on

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
There's also different tags you can spray paint

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
To give your teams different abilities

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
Like double damage or double money for killing other gang members

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
Or a smokescreen, stuff like that

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
So really cool gameplay

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
The actual deathmatch mode's pretty fun

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Doing some of that

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I like the shopping mall level that they have

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
That's kind of fun to play around in

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And then, what else did I play?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I got a random off-the-wall question for you about Saints Row 2

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
I know we have a news story coming up later on

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
About some of the controversy this game is generating

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Which game do you think is more violent

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
And has more potential for controversy?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
This game or Grand Theft Auto?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Seeing as they're very similar and appeal to the same audience

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Maybe this game a little bit

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Because they don't really get into

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I mean, there's corrupt police in Grand Theft Auto 4

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
In this game you can actually dress up or impersonate a cop

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
In this fictional cops type show

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
Called, I forget what it's called now

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
But it's, oh, The Fuzz

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
That's what the show's called

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
And you basically go around beating up

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Like Hot Fuzz?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yes

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
You go around beating up people dressed up as cops

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
While they're filming it and stuff

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And it's one of the activities

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Unless there's a level where you break into a police station

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Do a bunch of stuff like that

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
If anything, I'd say Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I think was more

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Kind of showing cops in a bad light

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But both games, I mean, the kill count

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
As far as police officers go

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Is going to be pretty high

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
I would think if anything Grand Theft Auto

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Might be a little bit higher just because

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
You don't really have gang members chasing after you

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
In Grand Theft Auto, it's mainly just the police

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Whereas in Saints Row, you have gang members

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
And the police chasing after you

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So, you know, just out of sheer numbers

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I think Grand Theft Auto 4, probably the percentage

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Of police officers killed would be a lot larger

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
You know, I'm somehow not surprised by that answer

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Because I would think if I'm the designers

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Behind Saints Row 2

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And I want to kind of break through that

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
You know, ceiling that Grand Theft Auto

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Has kind of put out there where, you know, Grand Theft Auto

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Is the creme de la creme of these sandbox games

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
You know, it's by far and wide the most popular

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I'm not surprised if I'm the developers of Saints Row 2

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And the people behind this game

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I know one of the best ways I'm going to get at

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And get close to that number is to one up

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The controversy they're doing

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Because that's half the reason why Grand Theft Auto sells

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
God, people need to understand

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
It's fiction, it's not like

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I go and go shoot the cops in the game

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Because I wish I could go shoot real cops

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I mean, that's not what happens

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It's just the opposition

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
It could be Nazis running this entire city

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
And it doesn't matter

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
If, you know, they're still coming after you

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Well, it's funny

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That you mention that, you know, this might seem completely random

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
But it is related, you know, I was at the movies

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
The other day and they were showing that little

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
What's that thing they do before? Like, you know how they play commercials

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Like 20 minutes while people walk in

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay, whatever it's called, the 20

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Well, I was only like half watching and I was kind of distracted

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Talking to somebody else and I look at the screen and go

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Oh, what's this movie? This looks neat

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And then, like, I saw some guy that looked like they were on fire

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And I'm like, wow, I'm kind of surprised I can show that in a trailer

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
It was Fable 2

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Like, I thought it was like an actual movie coming out

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But it was a Fable 2 commercial

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Yeah

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I mean, games are getting...

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
They've come a long way since combat, let's put it that way

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
But, yeah, I mean, it's just if

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, if you want to look at it like it's realistic

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
Or something like that, then yeah, okay, sure

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I guess it's offensive to cops or something

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
But you have to understand, games aren't meant to be

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
A simulation for real life

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
I mean, granted, you can make a game that's like

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
A simulation of real life

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
If you want, but then again, you can also make

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Pure fiction that's just way over the top

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Which is what Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto are doing

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
You know, to an extent

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
And Grand Theft Auto is a little bit more grounded

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
But still, it's pretty over the top

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
I don't know

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's just

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
You can find controversy anywhere

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
And then, the other game I've played

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
Which also has controversy, I guess, involved with it

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Would be Little Big Planet

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And Little Big Planet is amazing

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
That's easy to say

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
I mean, it's just an amazing game

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
The fact, from the very beginning of the game

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Even through the title credits sequence

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Which I might add is all in-game engine

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It's just incredible

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
It's just all of the stuff that was actually

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
In the game was made with the creator

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
In the game

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
So, you know, just going through

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Each of the levels of stuff in there

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
They kind of have a basic tutorial

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
To walk you through of how to play the game

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
As time goes on

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And then

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Each level, they actually have a storyline

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
That continues on

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And it's really, really cool

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Mildly offensive, but really, really cool

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I think some of the levels are

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
As we were talking about during the break

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
They're characters of

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Different sections of the world

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
So, like, the African level

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Is all like

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Think Lion King, basically

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Whereas the

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
British level

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Is the

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
British levels

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Are all knights in castles

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And that kind of thing

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
So it's a little bit racist

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
But in the way that it's a small world

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Is racist, where no one's gonna possibly be offended

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Because it's so damn cute

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
It's incredibly cute

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
It's incredibly cute

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Now, my thing with Sony, if they were smart

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
This sucker would be

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
In the next bundle that they're doing

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
This would be a bundle that's out

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
This holiday

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
They need to be bundling this game with the system

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Because I'm telling you, this game will sell systems

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Easy. You just get this out

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
People are gonna look at this and they're like

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh my god, you know, that's just an amazing game

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
It's way more amazing than Wii Sports

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
And I think it's gonna appeal to everybody

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Game of the year?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
It could definitely be a contender

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
For game of the year

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Anything else in your gaming week this week?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Umm

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
No.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I hate to take it back to Saints Row because you talk about that game an awful lot

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
But, a good question from chatroom

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
At chat.orangesonsrady.com

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
First chat comment of the night goes to C-more Booty

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Since you guys are talking about Saints Row 2

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Are you having any problems with crashing or freezing

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
In the game? It crashes my system every time

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I try to save manually

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Umm, not really

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
I've had it lock up a few times

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
But it's just random

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I mean, it's just like any other game

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
It's...

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
You know, I haven't really had any problems saving manually

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
Because I do it all the time

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
I want to quit or something

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
At that time

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
No, not really any problems with it

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Alright

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff this week

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Sadly, I'm sorry to disappoint

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
But I've had a lot going on in my personal life

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
But I will say this, the new WoW 3.0 patch came out this week

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Of course WoW being World of Warcraft

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Had a huge content upgrade this week

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
And you guys know I'm the resident Warcraft addict

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
On staff here

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Just having a lot of fun with that

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
There's been a lot of new things added into the game

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
With regards to talents

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I don't know how much I mentioned this on the show

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
But I play a balanced druid as my main character

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And so our class really got a lot of love

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
We have some new talents that are just awesome

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
I was using Starfall and PvP today and it's great

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
And one of my favorite new talents is something called Typhoon

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Where when you click it, it's like this big blue sploosh

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
That goes across the screen and everybody gets knocked back

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
So it's kind of awesome to use

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
That and PvP around the world

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
So, achievements as well have finally

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Come to World of Warcraft and a lot of time

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Kind of spent getting the achievements and new titles

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
To come with them

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
One of the first things my guild did as soon as the patch went live

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Probably about an hour of the patch going live

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
We went back to Ubers and the old WoW content

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And got ourselves the Jenkins title

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Because you can now, you know

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
WoW has this funny way of working in pop culture references

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
About WoW into WoW

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And this whole Leroy Jenkins thing

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Is now Leroy is an achievement

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
And if you get that achievement you can have Jenkins as your title

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
So that you're like, you know, if your character name is

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Sky

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
You would be Sky Jenkins

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Which is kind of funny

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
So there you go

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Other than Warcraft and experiencing the new patch

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
I actually, I took a trip

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And you folks that have been listening to the show for a long time

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Since we were about music games will appreciate this

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
And you guys here in studio

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
I went to Milpitas Golf Land this week

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I went to good old Miggle

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's changed a lot

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Since, you know, I hadn't been there in quite a few years

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Last time I was there I think they still had Derby Owners Club

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
Which is now at our Miggle

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
And at Milpitas Golf Land

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
You know, you have to remember

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
This is like the holy land of

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
BeatMania and the Bobani

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Between Milpitas and Sunnyvale Golf Land

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
You know, these were

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
I guess you could say Arcade Infinity to an extent

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
It was like the trinity of California

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Northern California

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Well, Arcade Infinity is southern technically

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
You know what I mean though

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
It's like one of the west coast hubs

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Of where DDR got big

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
And it's interesting to see, you know how

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Milpitas

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Used to have DDR in one of the rooms

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
That room, it's like two rooms

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
This arcade is like two separate buildings

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
One building now is nothing but ticket games

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Like I remember when we were first

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Going there, like half of it was ticket redemption

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
It was slowly spreading, well now it is

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Nothing but ticket redemption in one room

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
But it's interesting because they've turned the other room into

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
You know, like all the music

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Games are on one wall

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Then all the driving games are over here

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
And all the fighting games are over here

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
So it's kind of like you have just different little sections

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
It was kind of interesting, but I did play

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I played Midnight Maximum Tune 3

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
And I played Keyboard Mania

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Even though it was sticking on the keyboard

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
But a new game I played, Dance Dance Revolution

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Supernova 2, it's been out this whole time

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And I have not yet played it in arcades

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
And it was really the same damn thing as the last game

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
There wasn't much difference

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Just some new songs, yippee

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And some little flashy graphics when you get combos

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Forgot to let you know

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
This is totally local news

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Remember that one store that we went to

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That's right there by the Folsom Theater

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
The Gamer's Empire, whatever

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
They got a Supernova machine now

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Oh, nice

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
It's untouched, you know, basically

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Nice, well this is the other thing that surprised me

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Miggle is selling their DDR Extreme machine

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
They have a little sign on it that says

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
For Sale, guess how much they want for this

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Miggle machine, DDR Extreme machine

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
As is

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
$12,000

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
No, a little high, very high in fact

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's a used machine, no much higher

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
$8,000

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
A little lower

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
$7,000

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
$6,000 is what they want for this machine

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
$5,999 to be exact

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
If you can take the machine, retrofit it

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And upgrade it, I mean

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
That's always interesting

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
So that was it, and then I actually played miniature golf

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Which in all the times I've ever been to Milpitas Golf Line

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I never have played miniature golf there

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
But I did this time

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
So there you go

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Miniature golf, the real game

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
That's it, not a lot of whole other console games I've been playing

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Just, you know, experiencing wow this week

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And, you know, some of the same old console stuff I've been playing

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Like Rock Band and all that, good stuff

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It is episode number 299 tonight

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Which means next week is episode number 300

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
If you can believe it

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
And what we want you guys to do is

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
We want you to leave your messages for us

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
We're going to play them during next week's commercial break

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
If you want to say a few words about Orange Launch Radio

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Just try to keep it a minute or less

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
You can call the Skype line anytime when we're not live

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Don't call right now if you're listening live on Sunday night

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
But if you're listening to this in the podcast format

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
Give 1-877-GAME-OLR a call

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
And leave us a message about

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
What you think about us making episode 300

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
And we'll play it on the break next week

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Otherwise, it's going to be a good old fashioned show

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
You never know what kind of guest might show up

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Also, we have some games planned for next week

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
It'll be a good time, there you have it

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah, and something that

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Loki has a huge surprise, we'll say that

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
We'll say that much, Loki has a huge surprise

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
And let's see, what else do we have coming up?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
If you've been listening to the show this year

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
You know I've had some medical issues going on

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
I'm going to be having surgery right after episode 300

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
So we probably won't be having a show the next week

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
So we might have a little bit of a break after episode 300

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
We'll have more details on that next week, that's all

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
So we'll talk about that

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
And don't worry, the surgery is nothing major

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
It's gallbladder surgery, a million people have had it done

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm not that worried about it

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
I just kind of want to get it over with at this point

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
So, that's it for housekeeping

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Visit our MySpace, visit our Facebook

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Visit our live journal, our Twitter

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Loki, start us off

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Yes, anyways

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
So, this is kind of interesting

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Not too surprising because they haven't been doing well financially for a while now

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
But Infogrames has finally now finished purchasing Atari

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
They made an $11 million stock purchase of Atari

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
And previously they had owned 51.4%

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
But now they are done with the purchase

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
And we'll see where they take it

17:33.000 --> 17:37.000
Hopefully in the right direction

17:37.000 --> 17:41.000
And not, I don't know, into the red again

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
This is the same company that brought us the Epic 2600

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And my how times have changed, right?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
This is kind of, I don't know, kind of sad in a way

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
But you kind of saw it coming

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Because what has Atari done in the past five years

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
That's been really huge

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Besides maybe their flashback consoles

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Which are really cool, actually

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Dragon Ball Z

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I guess, alright

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But, I don't know, in a way it's kind of the end of an era

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Did I say error?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
No, I'm thinking of something else

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
The end of an era, you know what I mean?

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
So, it's kind of sad, but there you go

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
Hey, LittleBigPlanet has been stirring up a lot of talk this week

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
And one thing that's got people talking about LittleBigPlanet

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
Is the new license agreement that Sony has

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Sony actually recently changed the PlayStation Network terms of use

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
And basically to make a long story short

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Long story short

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Sony says now in the user license agreement

18:35.000 --> 18:39.000
You also authorize us and our affiliated companies without payment to you

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
To license, sell, and otherwise commercially exploit your user material

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
So if you don't like it, don't use it

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
If you create a LittleBigPlanet level in the game

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
And Sony decides they're going to sell it on a compilation later on

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Like maybe a best of for people that don't have online access

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
As I could possibly see forthcoming depending on how big this game is

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Too bad you're not getting any money for it

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
And if you don't like it, don't play the game

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
You know, I like how they actually have exploit in there

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
An interesting word

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I will rape your mother!

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
What? I don't know

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I don't think that'll be a LittleBigPlanet level

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Could be

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
It's kind of not surprising

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I know a lot of people are looking at this as a

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh my gosh, Sony is so big, bad, and evil corporate

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
But is it really that surprising in a way?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
No

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
Not really

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I would hope that they still give you credit for it at least

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
Or say, hey, you know, it's going to be in here

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
At least send you a free copy of the game, shit

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
That's the least they could do

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I mean a lot of people would probably be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put it in there

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
I mean, I don't think they

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't know, I would be like

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Hell yeah, go ahead and put that in there, just give me credit

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
But if you don't like it, you don't like it, don't use it

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Don't play the game

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I guess, I mean

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
I don't know, if you were really expecting to profit off LittleBigPlanet

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I think you might be playing the game for the wrong reasons, right?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I don't know

20:02.000 --> 20:08.000
Anyhow, we'll see how Sony plans to exploit user-created levels pretty soon

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Well, moving on to

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I don't know if this

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Well, exploitation just really isn't the best word for this

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I call it hypocrisy

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
But, you know, as we discussed with Bobby earlier

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Speaking of which

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
This is

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
LittleBigPlanet is being recalled

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
Because of religious content within the game

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
And technically, what it is

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Is two expressions from the Quran

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
Have made it into the game by means of a song that was licensed to be in the game

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
That came out a few years ago

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
And one person in the beta found it

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And apparently took offense to its presence

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
And therefore wrote a letter to Sony

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Which I have right here

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
Because I love pulling up, you know

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Archived content off of message boards after posts have been deleted for days

21:05.000 --> 21:11.000
And I'm not even going to bother pronouncing any of the Arabic

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Because I can't

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
We'll play the clip in a little bit

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Well, this is to Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
While playing your latest game LittleBigPlanet

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
In the first level of the third world in the game titled Swinging Safari Smiley Wink

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
I've noticed something strange in the lyrics of the music track of the level

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
When I listened carefully

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I hit the fair by accident

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
When I listened carefully

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
I was surprised to hear some very familiar Arabic words from the Quran

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
You can listen to the track here

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
We'll play it in a second

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
The words are in the 18th second

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
It's to translate

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Every soul shall have the taste of death

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
And to almost immediately after in the 27th second

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
All that is on earth will perish

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
I asked many of my friends online and offline

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And they had heard the exact same thing I heard easily

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
When I played that part of the track

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Certain Arabic hardcore gaming forums are already discussing this

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
So we decided to take action by emailing you before this spreads to mainstream attention

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
TOO LATE

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our holy Quran deeply offending

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
We hope you would remove the track from the game immediately via an online patch

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
And make sure that all future shipments of the game do not contain it

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
We'd also like to mention this isn't the first time something like this has happened in video games

22:26.000 --> 22:32.000
Nintendo's 1998 hit Zelda Ocarina of Time contained a musical track with Islamic phrases

22:32.000 --> 22:37.000
And was removed in later shipments of the game after Nintendo was contacted by Muslim organizations

22:37.000 --> 22:40.000
Last year Capcom, Zach and Wiki and Activision's Call of Duty 4

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
Also contained objectionable material offensive to Muslims that was spotted before the release of the final games

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
And both companies thankfully removed the content

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
We hope that you act immediately to avoid any confusion and necessary controversy

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
And we thank you for making such an amazing game

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Now I think the letter was very well worded

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
However, I'm going to go back and read a particular line from this, if I may

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our holy Quran deeply offending

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
So why aren't you offended at the artist that, you know, recorded the song in the first place?

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
Don't you think that's just a little bit of hypocrisy right there?

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
I mean, shouldn't you actually take issue up with the songwriter who, by the way, is Muslim, right?

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
Yeah, and the song has been out since 2006

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
Exactly, so why don't you do your homework first?

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
Okay, and to be honest, I mean, who is this really offending?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
It's not like, you know, death to America, woohoo!

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
You know, it's not, there's nothing like that

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
I mean, most people are not going to know what it means

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
They're just going to hear it and they're going to say, hey, that sounds African

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
Hey, that fits with the level in the game

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Because that's what I heard and that's what I thought

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
I'm like, hell, this song is fucking awesome

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
So put this in context to the game of why this music would be here in the first place

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Like, you know, in the Africa level you hear African style music

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
In the South America level you hear South American style music

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
So in the, you know, in a level that's appropriate you hear this music

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
It's world music, basically, so you're traveling to different parts of the world

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
But somehow this slipped under the radar where, you know, people didn't realize that this could be offensive

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
Even though the song's been out there for a while when nothing's said

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
Well, keep in mind also, this is what I drew a parallel to

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
Why aren't Christian groups being offended at Rock Band 2 for having System of a Down in it?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
They probably are

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
They probably are

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Why did the game come out then with that song in it if people are going to be offended?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
Probably because Christian groups don't care because they have their own music with lines for the Bible

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And they're, you know, it's Christian rock

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
And they're just like, hell yeah, spread the word, you know, but, um

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
But it's the same equivalent is what I'm saying

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
But I'm just sorry, I mean

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
If I get, you know, pissed off, okay, if something I find offensive in a game and I write Sony a letter

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
They're going to be like, fuck off

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
If I say I'm Arab, then they're like, oh, oh, now we're going to listen to you

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
Double fucking standard

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
I disagree, I disagree, I completely disagree

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
And especially something that's going on in the country

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
Especially over here is that we're seeing people catering to different ethnic groups

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Because of this whole perception of oppression

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
That really should not exist in America in the modern world

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
I am going to put together a letter then to Sony and Media Monocle

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
And I'm going to tell them how deeply offended I am that they are censoring the game

25:29.000 --> 25:34.000
You know, when, I don't understand why if we offend one person

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I don't get why it's a big deal if we're offended

25:37.000 --> 25:45.000
I actually do wonder how Sony would have reacted if the letter came that had absolutely no reference to the person sending it being Muslim

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Or if they specifically said, I am not Muslim, however

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Their reaction would have been different

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
There is a freaking double standard, I'm sorry

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
I'm going to, just to give some context to this

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I'm going to play the clip from this game

25:59.000 --> 26:02.000
It's hit the gaming blog, somebody recorded it off their phone

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
I'm going to give credit where credit is due

26:04.000 --> 26:10.000
We pulled this from Kotaku where I believe one of their users got the sound clip and posted it on the site there

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
I'm going to play it, if you think for whatever reason this might offend you

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I urge you to not listen to the next minute of the program

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
But I just want to give this some context

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
And so that our listeners can understand kind of where the controversy might be spreading from

26:23.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm going to play the clip

26:36.000 --> 26:58.000
So it definitely sets a certain type of world mood, right, this music

26:58.000 --> 27:03.000
And there's an awful lot of ignorant Americans out there that are not going to know anything what was just said

27:03.000 --> 27:08.000
Not going to know any of that, just going to think, oh it matches the mood

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
I know three words in Arabic and I couldn't say them off the top of my head

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
So how was that?

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Look, I want to present a different opinion here

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Because I think although I do see the overreaction going on here a little bit

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
And I think you're right, there are other religious things that are offensive that are in video games

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
I think in a way Sony's doing us all a favor by pulling this game

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
Is it a little bit hypersensitive? Yes, but is it Sony's fault? No

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Whose fault is it? The media's fault

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
Because unfortunately if this had gone out and the wrong person had heard about it

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
And instead CNN, Al Jazeera, MSNBC gets a letter about this

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Then it's suddenly going to be all over the mainstream press that

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
Oh my gosh, video games are teaching children passages from the Quran

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And it's over, you know what I mean at that point

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
It's just another outrage of the violence in games and the messages that games are teaching us

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Now it's religious text

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Well who's going to say that it's not going to happen anyways?

28:08.000 --> 28:18.000
And now let's see, how about the people representing Mexico saying that they don't like the way that Mexicans are portrayed in this game

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Or how about the way that South America is portrayed in this game

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Or how about the way that, you know

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
I see Sony sees smoke and they're trying to put out the fire before it spreads

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
I kind of, and forgive me for going to a comedian on this one

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
But I kind of want to quote Carlos Mencia about talking about people being offended about the Taco Bell dog

28:34.000 --> 28:42.000
He's like, the Taco Bell dog sends out messages for people that Mexicans are stupid

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
He's like, no, it's sending out messages to buy more tacos

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
You know, it's people looking to be offended at something

28:49.000 --> 28:58.000
It's people that are trying to find an excuse to, I really do think it's people just trying to find some sort of excuse

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
To put a little drama into their lives, to break up the monotony

29:01.000 --> 29:06.000
Instead of trying to just say, hey, it's in there, I don't care

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
You know, why, it's not, if you're going to be offended at it being in the game

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
Be offended at the person that recorded the song to begin with

29:14.000 --> 29:19.000
And in a way, yeah, I'm kind of like, well, where is the stink about this back in 2006

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
But then again, us being gamers, you know, maybe we didn't hear about it

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Maybe there was a fuss and we didn't hear about it, I don't know

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
But I highly doubt there was or, you know, it would have been on the news

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
And I think all of us watch the news on a regular enough basis

29:29.000 --> 29:33.000
We would have heard something about it, especially considering the guy who recorded this won a Grammy

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
However, I don't think the mainstream media would have given a fuck

29:37.000 --> 29:39.000
I think they would have placed blame on the game

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And I think Sony is just trying to put out that fire

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
It's sad, but that's the world we live in

29:44.000 --> 29:45.000
It sucks, but

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
No, I agree with you that Sony is straight

29:47.000 --> 29:52.000
But I also do think that it would not have gotten as much attention from Sony

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
Had it not specifically said, I and other Muslims are offended by this

29:57.000 --> 30:01.000
Because we do have that double standard

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
That if you are some sort of oppressed group, and I say oppressed in quotes

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
That you automatically have to have someone throw you a bone

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I'm sorry, that's not how it works

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
Was this dude like the only Muslim person playing this game?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
You know, in the beta or something?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
It was one person in the beta, he posted about it

30:16.000 --> 30:20.000
And found other people in his religious group that were equally offended

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Were they playing the game?

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
I have a hard time believing he was the one and only Muslim in the beta

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
No, that's what I just said

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
He was talking to other people in other forums like he said in his letter

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
To his credit, his letter was well worded and very respectful

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
That I do have to commend him on

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
And he wasn't asking for the game to be recalled

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
And I don't think we're placing any of the blame on this guy at all for maybe bringing it to light

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
I believe it specifically said, future releases not contain it

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Patch the first releases, future printings, don't include it

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
That's acceptable, and that's part of what the beta is there for

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
To weed out offensive material, to weed out bugs

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
To make sure that you're releasing clean, safe content

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Relative to the content you're releasing, you know what I mean?

31:01.000 --> 31:09.000
To be honest, that's about the equivalent of what they would have done had, granted that I was San Andreas, come out on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
They would have patched it, and then they would have made sure that all additional copies would not contain that content

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
But I am going to, like I said before, I don't know that Sony

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
I think he was right

31:23.000 --> 31:27.000
The guy who sent the letter was right to voice his concern

31:27.000 --> 31:30.000
If he felt like it was a big enough concern, he was right to voice it

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Because what's one thing that I always say?

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Nothing changes until you put forth the effort to make it change, am I correct?

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
I think though that the recall should be voluntary

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Because if you are offended by it, then yes

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
They should give you the opportunity to send in your copy of the game so that you don't have to hear that

31:46.000 --> 31:51.000
But if a person like me, who thinks the song is pretty kick-ass and doesn't really care what it says

31:51.000 --> 31:55.000
Wants to keep it, then I don't see what the big deal is

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
And see, that's part of what I-

31:57.000 --> 32:03.000
Because now they're oppressing me and my desire to have this song in the game

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
For my own personal use

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
And they're oppressing me to benefit somebody else

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
That is my problem

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
I don't have a problem with someone being offended by it and they're fixing it for them

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
But I want to be able to keep my game the way it is

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
That's the point I was getting to

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
If you are offended by something, then sure

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
They should give you the option to remove the offensive content

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
But for those who are not offended by it, those who don't care

32:28.000 --> 32:31.000
It's pointless

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
You're wasting time and money

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You could just put out a patch

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Why should one-

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
Because one group of people is offended by content that does not offend

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
Now, especially when the content is not attacking another group

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
Now if this was content that was saying

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
We hate all of so-and-such's group, kill them all

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
Then, yes, it should be removed, don't you think?

32:55.000 --> 33:00.000
But if it's just something, not even a specific statement just saying

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
Oh, well one day the Earth is gone and all this stuff is gonna happen

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Well it's just like reading Revelations, really

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
I mean, that-

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
It's nothing that's directed towards a party that anyone who is not in that faith

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Would really get the reference to

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
You know, I just don't think there's an easy answer to this

33:19.000 --> 33:22.000
I think this whole story is just a reflection of the world we live in

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
People are just too fucking offended

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
I know

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
But you know, I'm sitting here thinking, it's live radio

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
And sometimes I'm giving a lot of these stories a lot of thought

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
As we're sitting here talking about them

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
And I'm thinking, there's a story coming up later in the show in Part B

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Where we're gonna talk about something that's coming out in an upcoming game

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
That kind of offends me a little bit

33:40.000 --> 33:45.000
And although I can take offense, I know how to be offended or whatever

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
It's just kind of one of those things where, gosh

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
You know, even I look at some of the things that happen in video games

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
And I go, this is so stupid

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
Like, I wish games would kind of learn how to, I don't know

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
Address some of these things more appropriately

33:57.000 --> 34:01.000
And in a way I feel like a hypocrite kind of sitting here going

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
You know, well everybody should just kind of learn to deal with it

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
When I'm thinking about, well come think of it

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
There are some things in video games that offend me

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
And exactly, but do you think that you would get equal representation

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
If you had emailed that company that makes that game

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Hell to the no

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Exactly, exactly my damn point

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm sorry, there's, what about Redneck Rampage, okay?

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
Now while I personally don't consider myself to be a redneck

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
I do consider quite a number of my relatives to be purely

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
Jeff Foxworthy defines redneck as someone completely lacking in sophistication

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
I agree, that's most of my family

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Not my immediate, but aunts and uncles and cousins and what have you

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
Anyway, but then, so if I said, you know, I'm from, you know

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Mobile, Alabama and I'm offended at this game

34:50.000 --> 34:55.000
Or I'm offended at how you've portrayed this southern person in this game as being stupid

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
Just because they talk a little slower and have a thick accent

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
That doesn't mean that their IQ is any lower than anybody else's

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
You know, I could say I'm offended at that

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
Or I could just laugh and go, I'm related to people like that

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Which is basically my opinion towards Larry the Cable Guy

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
Basically, just watch South Park, there was that one episode basically saying

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
You know, about pulling a family guy off TV

35:17.000 --> 35:21.000
If you do it for one person, then what's, you know, you have to do it for everybody

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
You know, I don't know, I don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
But what the hell, we're here, we do this show for a reason to talk about things

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
But, you know, the story I want to talk about later has to do with an upcoming game

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
That just reinforces gay stereotypes I wish would go away

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
You know, and as a gay man, it gets really old after a while

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
You know, seeing some of these gay stereotypes in games

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
So I just kind of sit here and go, God, I wish I would just, you know, fucking grow up

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
You know, some of these people that program the games

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
So I'm thinking to myself, but at the same time, you know, maybe there's people that are Arab

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
That are sick of some of these stereotypes that are in the game

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
About, you know, the, you know, the verses that are being said

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
I don't know, you know, in a way, I just don't want to be a hypocrite here

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
But see, that's the thing

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
There's quite a bit of difference between what you're discussing and what's going on

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
This is just

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
Well, at the same time, CNN would never run a story either

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
On the fact that this other game comes out and offends gay people

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
That would never happen, never happen

36:09.000 --> 36:12.000
Because it's stereotypes that a lot of people think about

36:12.000 --> 36:15.000
Well, going back to the massive double standard

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
About what's considered bigotry and what's not, really

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
You know, it's like I was just saying in the chat room

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You know, racism is racism

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
It doesn't matter

36:24.000 --> 36:27.000
Like, I brought up an example

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
We did a diversity class at my work

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
You know, any corporation does diversity classes

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And I brought a situation

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And I think I said it on the show

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
When I worked in Alabama at Aladdin's Castle

36:36.000 --> 36:42.000
Where this black lady and her children wanted me to change out quarters

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Give them, you know, make change for them

36:44.000 --> 36:47.000
And I said, I'm sorry, I can't make change for you because you're not a customer

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
She just wandered in from the store across the street

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
And not across the street, but across the aisle

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
And she's like, you're just doing that because I'm black and love

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
I'm like, no, I'm doing it because you're not a paying customer here

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
If you want me to make change for you, there's a street fighter machine right there

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
And she shut up and walked away

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
So, but you see what I mean

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Racism is racism

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Bigotry is bigotry

37:08.000 --> 37:13.000
And as long as we perpetuate, you know, that type of thought

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
And as long as we keep getting offended

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
Instead of just learning to roll a little bit with the punches

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Give a little, take a little

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Then what's going to happen?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
You know, we're breeding a different kind of intolerance

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Don't you think?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
That's a reasonable answer, thank you

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
Alright, let's go see what the Twitter had to say

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
Every week we like to post something on OLR

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
And obviously this is a story that's generating a lot of buzz out there in the gaming community

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
And just, I think it's invoking a reaction that goes a lot of ways beyond gaming

37:44.000 --> 37:47.000
So I'm kind of curious to see what happens over the next couple of weeks

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Of course then this game will come out censored

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
And people will forget years from now

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
But anyhow, the question we asked our folks on Twitter

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
Twitter.com slash OLR

37:55.000 --> 37:59.000
Did Sony overreact by recalling LittleBigPlanet due to the controversial music in the game?

37:59.000 --> 38:00.000
Why or why not?

38:00.000 --> 38:03.000
And here's some of the responses that we got on our Twitter

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
Starting off with Dark Tetsuya

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
Yes, since the fix was the simplest day one patch

38:09.000 --> 38:12.000
There wasn't that much of a need to delay the game a whole week

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
But let's not forget, not everybody has online capability

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Crows says, of course they didn't overreact

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
This being America, everyone sues for anything

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Sony wants to avoid a lawsuit

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
Point, but this was also a worldwide recall

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
Let's not forget that

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And I don't know about lawsuit

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
I'm not trying to prove all our listeners wrong

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I'm sorry, but I just want to say

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Look at this too

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
Geekboy2424 says, yes, nobody would have noticed if they wouldn't have mentioned it

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
The person who heard this had to have scanned it

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Well, he was a beta tester, right?

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
Not to mention that he's also probably very familiar with the Quran as well

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
I don't know about you, but if someone quotes Bible versus me

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I don't know what the hell they're talking about

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
Well, I do know, and this is just a little bit I know

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
Because one of my co-workers is Muslim

39:00.000 --> 39:04.000
Is that their prayers are done in Arabic, if I'm correct

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
And so you do end up learning a little bit of Arabic as you study

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
Let me read some of these other responses

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
Marin Marvel says, I think that it was overreacting a bit

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
But I can understand because of not wanting to offend people

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Especially in this too happy day and age

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
Dust Stories says, wait, we have to please everyone and offend no one

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
We better stop the world now then

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Big overreaction

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Peter Uno says, hell no, oh fine, enough of that

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
To be honest, political correctness is going overboard

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
It seems silly that nobody cared until launch

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Gold Anthro says, yes, with the game being awaited for so long

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Just to remove it for something so small seems unnecessary

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
DJ Tyrant says, no, it was something that needed to be removed and caught earlier

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
Not everyone is connected to the interwebs either

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
The SEG says, considering worldwide reactions to cartoons, absolutely not

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
Recalls are less expensive than riots

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Interesting point, interesting point

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
Decipher13 says, with people suing for less these days, Sony didn't overreact

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Receiving the game at work and it being recalled in the same day was odd

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
So there you have it, some of our comments from the Twitter

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
At twitter.com slash OLR

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
And I'm sure this will go on for quite some time

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
I'm curious to see what kind of emails we get this week

40:11.000 --> 40:18.000
I don't know, again, I think this is the type of quandary to where there's no easy answer

40:18.000 --> 40:21.000
There's no easy solution because unfortunately there are people that will get offended

40:21.000 --> 40:26.000
And it could affect gaming's perception out there as a whole

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
And it's just a shame, it's a shame

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
It's just, I really, my last two cents on it really

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Is just, I'm not looking forward to a world where no one can have any sort of free thought or opinion of their own

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
Without someone else trying to strike them down for being wrong

40:44.000 --> 40:48.000
My final thing is, I don't have a problem

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
He wants to make a comment, so do I

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Don't be oppressing me, woman, seriously

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Estrogen Brigade!

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
Now, I don't have a problem with them fixing it for the people that want it to be fixed

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
But I do have a problem with them fixing it for the people that don't really care

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Or want it to be fixed in the first place

41:09.000 --> 41:14.000
All I gotta say is they better replace it with a damn good song because that really fit with the game

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
And, I don't know, make an instrumental version of it or something

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Perfect, perfect solution

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
Alright, well, we'll see what happens

41:22.000 --> 41:27.000
I don't really have a final thought on this because I think I'm still developing one

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
So, let's go back to the Dick and Fart jokes

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
They should totally put in Two Knock Two Knock

41:31.000 --> 41:36.000
Well, I don't know if Dick and Fart jokes were included with these

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
But PS3 and the PSP have received brand new firmware updates

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
The PS3 at a whopping 2.50

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
And PSP at, now, 5.0 firmwares

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
Some of the brand new features included with that

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
The PSP version is getting the PlayStation Online Store now

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Which is pretty awesome

41:57.000 --> 42:02.000
Also, the PS3 version, Flash 9 support

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
Oh boy, that's gonna be some good stuff

42:05.000 --> 42:08.000
That probably means that some of those Flash IRC chats work now

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Or what about some of those Flash emulators?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Or some of the Flash emulators

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
That's where my mind went instantly

42:14.000 --> 42:19.000
Half the reason people bought a PSP in the beginning was to play Nintendo emulators on them

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And now everything kind of comes full circle

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Well, I was kind of disappointed that Flash 9 is not on the PSP

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Because that makes things a lot easier

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
But no, just on the PS3

42:28.000 --> 42:37.000
And also, I guess, they're including support now for the official PS3 Bluetooth adapter

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
Because they're now releasing a new headset that's gonna be with SOCOM and stuff

42:41.000 --> 42:46.000
You can set your system to automatically shut down after downloading stuff

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
And then, I have to remember what else was added with the PSP

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
Probably just some minor fixes and stuff

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
And trying to fix it so that no one can crack it

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Oh darn, too bad that failed again

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
So apparently the day after it came out

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
It was already cracked and the custom firmware 5.0 was released

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
So, uh, oh well

43:13.000 --> 43:18.000
Do you think somebody's gonna come up with a patch to patch the offensive music back in LittleBigPlanet?

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Not to go back to that story, but

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
You know, with people that want to keep breaking Sony, what Sony destroys

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
I did want to mention though, there was a story that we didn't make it in there

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
One of the things that was included with the new PS3 firmware

43:31.000 --> 43:37.000
Is there's a recovery menu that you can access now by holding down the power button

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Until you hear three beeps

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
And that'll allow you to fix bad firmware updates

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Say your power goes out or something like that while it's installing

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Or god knows something happens

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
And a bunch of other things

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
So you can actually help recover your system so it doesn't break

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
Which is nice, I'm glad that they threw that in there

43:55.000 --> 44:01.000
Alright, well hey, you know, some of the things that they're also kind of reformatting on the Sony side

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
Especially when it comes into the store and how things are being presented on the online store

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
It looks like companies are now starting to get their own little special stores

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Capcom is one of the first that we're hearing about

44:11.000 --> 44:15.000
Capcom has their own little like company version of the Playstation store

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
If you go to the Capcom store you can get all of Capcom stuff kind of in one little place on the Playstation Network store

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
You get the Capcom demos, their games, their themes, it's all in one spot

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
Now funny enough this wasn't an idea of Capcom's, it was actually Sony's

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Who I guess must have presented the idea to them

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
And if you think this is going to be only in the Sony side of things

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
Guess what, they're saying that the new Xbox experience that's coming out

44:36.000 --> 44:39.000
Means that Microsoft will be able to do something similar for their companies

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
So it's going to be very interesting is that you almost now are going to go from one

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
It's kind of cool in a way, in my mind I'm envisioning now that online shopping for these networks

44:48.000 --> 44:54.000
Is now going from one giant everything stop shop that the company owns

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Like Microsoft's Walmart or Sony's Target

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Is now going to be like a strip mall

45:00.000 --> 45:03.000
Where you can go into the Capcom store and go into the Konami store

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
It's going to be interesting to see what each company has to offer

45:06.000 --> 45:11.000
It's going to be very very interesting to see what this does for like company branding in the video games

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
You know what I mean?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
Like what stores will people visit first?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And who puts out what product?

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Because you know back in the days of the NES

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
I don't think a lot of people followed these things

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
Most people didn't even know that Konami and Ultra were really the same company

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
They just would follow a particular series or whatever

45:29.000 --> 45:32.000
But it's very interesting now that we have this very company branded atmosphere

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
That these online stores are going to create

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Could be interesting

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Of course I could be talking a whole lot of nothing

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
What ends up being really no big deal

45:39.000 --> 45:42.000
Because it still is going to be one centralized place too I'm sure

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
But who knows? We'll see when the new Xbox experience comes out

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
When more of these stores launch on the Playstation side

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
I had to make a response to Geekboy2424 in the chat room

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
What did he say?

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
He disagrees with me that parents shouldn't please let their children play

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Yes they should

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
It's the parent's job

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
However

46:05.000 --> 46:10.000
Don't miss out that I have said parents need to be educated

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
And actually research instead of making a blanket assumption

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
It doesn't mean parents should put the ban hammer down

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
I think Geekboy2424 is a rather younger listener of ours

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
Which is why I think he might get a little bit hurt

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
That we're saying your parents need to be watching or whatever

46:26.000 --> 46:29.000
But we're not saying the parents need to ban everything

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
The parents need to be watching

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
And the parents should at least know what you're doing

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
As far as this show is concerned

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
I don't think folks of a certain age should necessarily even be listening to this show

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
Without the parents kind of knowing what they're listening to on the internet

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
I like to think we're a good influence and not a bad one

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
But your parents have a right to know

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
This is my suggestion, this is what I used to do with my mother

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
True, it was over NES games when I was much younger

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
But why don't you find a review of the game

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
Find some video clips of the game

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
And then say, hey, this is the game that I want to play

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Do you mind if we pick it up?

47:04.000 --> 47:10.000
And being an adult, hopefully they should be able to make a decision

47:10.000 --> 47:14.000
Whether or not they consider what you think okay is okay

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Recognize some of your passion behind it too

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Exactly

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
Maybe you'll get props for like, wow, our kid actually put together a whole little prosecution

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Instead of just going, but I want it

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Which was, I've tried that a couple times too

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Yeah, me too

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Then they'll say, well, you've obviously put some thought into it

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
Maybe I should think that maybe you're old enough to have an opinion

47:36.000 --> 47:39.000
I'm sorry, kids, we've got smart kids out there

47:39.000 --> 47:43.000
People who definitely have an opinion shouldn't just be discounted because of their age

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
Right?

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
That's true

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
So help your parents make an informed decision

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
If you truly think that you should have this game, put some effort into it

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Let them know why

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
So my next story

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Yeah, go ahead

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Sorry

47:57.000 --> 48:02.000
There has been a little bit of a tease now

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
That those who finished the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
Get a little teaser trailer saying Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
Is supposed to come out sometime in the future

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
And there's actually, I think, some video up around this

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
Up on Joystiq if anyone wants to take a look at it

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
And it's your typical teaser

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
I watched it just because I thought the first Bioshock was pretty graphically stunning

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Just to tell you the teaser is your typical teaser video

48:34.000 --> 48:39.000
It's nothing but, you know, the one shot of the girls standing on the beach or whatever

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
And the one line, it's a teaser in every sense of the word

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
On the Atlantic Coast

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
And just the fact it's coming

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
And it gives you that tagline, Sea of Dreams

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
And that's it

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Yeah

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
That's what a teaser is

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
So in other words, Bioshock 2 is coming

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Duh, you know what I mean?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
They needed some teasing to do that

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
I guess now you have a subtitle, so there you go

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
When's it coming out? Soon

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
Soon, someday

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
Actually I don't think it's coming out too soon

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
A few years, well maybe

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
2010

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Soon is a blanket term

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Summer 2010, I don't know, that's a guess

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
I say summer 2010

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
I like that, we'll just use that from everything now

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
What?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Summer 2010

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
That's when all the games are coming out

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
That's when Final Fantasy 13 is coming out, summer 2010

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
We'll be lucky if it comes out by that time

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
Alright

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Release dates

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
Well there are other games coming out

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
This week at least

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
Starting off, we've got

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
The World of Goo, which is coming to PC

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Fun little casual game there

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Did very well on a

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I think it's on the Wii already, I'm not sure

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
As part of the WiiWare

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
And of course, today

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Rock Band 2 finally made it out on the PS3

49:52.000 --> 49:58.000
Also the special edition bundles for PS3 and Xbox 360 are now available

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
The Naked Brothers Band is coming out

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
With a game, a karaoke game

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
Playstation 2 and the Wii for that one

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Hooray

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
Penny Racer's Party Turbo Q Speedway

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Apparently that got delayed from last week

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
And that's hopefully coming out this week now

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
Spongebob

50:21.000 --> 50:24.000
Featuring Nicktoons and the Globs of Doom

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
Will be out on Playstation 2, the Wii, and on the DS

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Let's see here

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
Back at the Barnyard, slot bucket games for the DS

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
We have Midnight Club Los Angeles on Playstation 3

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
And the Xbox 360

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
Also Midnight Club LA Remix for the PSP

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
Midnight Club is a pretty awesome racing game

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I'll play that a little bit at PAX

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
Pass the Pigs, coming to DS

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
That's that old dice game, Pigs, if you remember that

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
Oh, they would land in the certain formations?

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Oh my god, okay

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Yeah, whopping 20 bucks for that

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
Why would you play a dice game on a video game?

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
I don't know

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
It's a good travel game

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
You can't throw pigs around in a car

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
They'll get lost

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Alright, fair enough

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Why do people buy Uno on Xbox Live?

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
I throw pigs around all the time, just letting you know

51:18.000 --> 51:22.000
We actually have a Dwarf Potbelly

51:22.000 --> 51:26.000
That we throw around on long trips at semis

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
Wow

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Wow

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
Lovely Lisa on DS

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
Yes, it's an import doll game

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Yippee

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Hooray, it's like a little doll that no one knows

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
Wii Music is coming out finally on the Wii

51:40.000 --> 51:43.000
I know everybody's excited about that one

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
I am

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
Why?

51:45.000 --> 51:48.000
I liked it, I'm getting it for free anyway

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
What does it matter?

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
If you had to pay for it, would you?

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
No

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Okay, that's what I thought

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
I'm getting it for free

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Make the grade, coming to the DS and the Wii

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
Oh, I had no idea that was coming out this soon

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
I thought for some reason it was in January

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
Well, they do a really good job advertising their games

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
Go Konami

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000

That's PlayStation 2, Wii and DS

53:27.000 --> 53:33.000
Build-A-Bear Workshop, Fur Seasons on the Wii

53:33.000 --> 53:37.000
God, there's a lot of crap coming out

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Anything else big?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Other than that, we'll just move on

53:41.000 --> 53:45.000
Well, yeah, just small games like Far Cry 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
Fable 2 on Xbox 360

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000

Because I know everybody's looking forward to that

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
Whoopee

53:56.000 --> 53:59.000
I think that's all the big stuff

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Taking a quick look here

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Let's travel over to Japan, take a look at the Japanese release dates

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
There's not a lot to speak of on the Xbox 360

54:06.000 --> 54:10.000
NBA Live 09 gets its Japanese localization on October 23

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
That coming out from EA over in Japan

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Heading on over to the PlayStation 3

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
I imagine they're getting the same thing, and they sure are

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
Also, by the way, on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
Gundam Musou is getting a price reduction on both systems

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
So if you haven't checked that out yet, you can

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii in Japan

54:28.000 --> 54:31.000
The Happy Dance Collection comes out from Namco Bandai this week

As well as Gensai Table Games Wii

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Pro Golfers Saru and Tenchu 4 comes out

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
Monkey!

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
There you go

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
I guess

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
Devil Summoner, a new game in the Devil Summoner series

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
Comes out on October 23

54:48.000 --> 54:51.000
As well as Ever17, the Out of Infinity

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Although I think that might just be a price reduction

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Yeah, that's just a price reduction

54:55.000 --> 55:00.000
Also, Hakugen no Soryou Contract to Future comes out as well

55:00.000 --> 55:03.000

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Also gets a price reduction as well as Remember 11

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
And Sakura Taisen 3 also goes into Sega The Best series

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
So lots of price reductions this week

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Price reductions this week

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Didn't it get out to like 5 in the Sakura Taisen series?

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
I don't know how far they got, but it's just number 3

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
I think 4 came out on Dreamcast, didn't it?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
3 was out on PlayStation 2, I guess

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
I don't know if that was a newer version or what

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Could be

55:29.000 --> 55:34.000
On the Nintendo DS, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker gets a price reduction

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
As does Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 12 Revenant Wings

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Both getting price reductions as well

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
As far as new games go, you got Katsuie Death Label

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
As well as Kimi no Yuusha comes out from SNK Playmore

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
On the DS, as well as Soul Eater, Medusa no Inubu comes out

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
And Wakamama Fashion Gals Mode

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Because I know you were looking forward to that

55:52.000 --> 55:53.000
That sounds funny

55:53.000 --> 55:56.000
That is a first party title in Japan, so go figure

55:56.000 --> 55:59.000
Quickly looking at the Sony PSP to see what comes out this week

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Bleach Soul Carnival looks to be a big title they're getting

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
And I know a lot of Bamani and music game fans are very excited about this

56:06.000 --> 56:10.000
One of my really good friends is obsessed with DJ Max

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
And there's a new DJ Max game coming out this week on the Sony PSP

56:14.000 --> 56:17.000
From what I understand, there also is going to be a US version of this game before November

56:17.000 --> 56:18.000
I want Soul Eater

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
So there you go, what's that?

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
I want Soul Eater

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
You want Soul Eater?

56:21.000 --> 56:25.000
I was going to say their one small game I missed

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
What's that?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Coming out a week from today

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Guitar Hero World Tour

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
It will be coming out on everything

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
Well that's because it's not a Tuesday game

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
It's a Sunday game

56:37.000 --> 56:41.000
And it's going to be epic I guess

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
By the way, to specify, DJ Max is the Classic Y edition

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
There already is several DJ Max games on the PSP

56:48.000 --> 56:49.000
This is the Classic Y edition

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
By the way, one other game I want to point out on the PSP this week in Japan

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
From Sega, Garnet Chronicle comes out as well

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
DarkSaga, take us to Europe

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Here are our European releases

56:59.000 --> 57:02.000
Well at least as far as the UK is concerned

57:02.000 --> 57:07.000
We have on the 21st EverQuest seeds of destruction

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
I just like saying destruction, that's pretty freaking awesome

57:10.000 --> 57:11.000
A name with destruction

57:11.000 --> 57:12.000
Destruction of destruction?

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
This should just be ultimate destruction

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Destroying the destructors

57:16.000 --> 57:17.000
Or something

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
New game from OLR Studios

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
On the 24th we have Dead Space

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
Looking forward to that

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Disaster Day of Crisis

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
Dungeon Maker

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Fable 2

57:27.000 --> 57:30.000
Which actually my husband has to work for the midnight launch tomorrow

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So I'm going to laugh

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
We also have Legendary on Xbox 360

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Well I don't

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
LittleBigPlanet is given the 24th date

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
Although we know that's not going to happen anymore

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Exactly, but I'm just saying

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
Also Midnight Club Los Angeles on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
As well as Midnight Club Los Angeles remix on PSP

57:54.000 --> 57:57.000
Star Ocean The First Departure on PSP

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
Not too bad, huh?

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Not a bad week at all

58:02.000 --> 58:06.000
And it's just going to get busier and busier as we get closer to the holiday

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
Well that one last game that I had mentioned

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
Guitar Hero World Tour

58:14.000 --> 58:17.000
Is very similar to another game series, Rock Band

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
And Rock Band of course is getting

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
You don't say

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Yes, I don't say

58:22.000 --> 58:25.000
Rock Band is getting a brand new download pack as it does every week

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
And this time it's Nirvana

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
You get 7 songs from Nirvana

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
Including Breed, Lounge Act, On a Plane

58:33.000 --> 58:38.000
Polly, Something in the Way, Stay Away, and Territorial Pissings

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
And each of those is available for $2

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Or you can save $3, buy the whole pack

58:44.000 --> 58:47.000
For $11 or $880

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
But isn't it interesting that it's completely missing

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Like the biggest songs on that album

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I think was on that album too

58:56.000 --> 58:57.000
Isn't that strange?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
Yeah it is a little strange except

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
I think Smells Like Teen Spirit is in

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Guitar Hero World Tour

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
And I'm not sure about the rest of them

59:06.000 --> 59:09.000
Yeah but it's not like games haven't shared the same songs before

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Well they may have exclusive rights to that song

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Money talks

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
I guess

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Alright well hey if you have opted for Guitar Hero World Tour

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
One of the things you can look forward to downloading next year

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
That's right they're announcing download stuff for next year

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
On the Guitar Hero side

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
The brand new Oasis album Dig Out Your Soul

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
I had no idea that Oasis was still putting out music

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
I haven't heard much of their stuff

59:31.000 --> 59:34.000
There's probably some British folks over on the other side of the pond

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
That are like bonk to me

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
But they don't play them on the radio at all here anymore

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Not since Wonderwall back in the mid 90's

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
But they are still cranking out music

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
They have a new album coming out Dig Out Your Soul

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
And that will be coming out next year

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Some of the singles from that album

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Bag It Up, Waiting For The Rapture, The Shock Of The Lightning

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Are all coming out on Guitar Hero World Tour

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
So if you are an Oasis fan

59:54.000 --> 59:58.000
And you're mad at me for my comment of not hearing them lately

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
You at least have that to look forward to

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
There you go

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Well

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Here's some more rumors

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Hey wait a minute, you're the resident Blur fangirl

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
We haven't heard a lot of Blur

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Like, I love Blur talk on the show lately

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Didn't Blur and Oasis have like a feud thing years ago?

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Did they ever get over that?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I think that, well since Blur is basically disbanded

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Because Graham Coxon got really offended when they told him

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
STOP DRINKING

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And he's like, well screw you guys

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You throw me out of the band, I'm never coming back

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You knew that was the story right?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Did he call them all bloody wankers?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Because if he did, that's too good

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Probably things a lot worse than calling someone wanker

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
However

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Graham Coxon has gone off to do his own thing

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Damon has Gorillaz and also has The Good, The Bad, and The Queen

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Which is pretty freaking good

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Well I was thinking maybe if Guitar Hero is getting Oasis

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
This might mean Blur for Rock Band

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
If that whole little feud is totally on

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I would totally love it if we had Blur for Rock Band

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
You know, we need to do a list list just for me

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Of what Blur songs do we want to hear in Rock Band

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
We'll put that on the list of things to do

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I'm sorry, we can move on now with news

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Speaking of music games, there's a trailer

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
A trailer that doesn't really have much to do with anything as far as I'm concerned

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But it's the Guitar Hero Metallica trailer

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Obviously taken with a shaky webcam or phone cam

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Or, you know, has no gameplay shown, no nothing like that

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And those look good, Rob

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
What I'm eating, by the way

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Orin Sam's Foodio for a minute

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I found these when I was in the Bay Area this weekend

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
And I about crapped myself

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I was so excited

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They're flat fortune cookies

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
So they're fortune cookies, but they're just ironed out flat

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And without the fortune, obviously, in them

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But I love the taste of fortune cookies

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
And I know there's probably some of our listeners going

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Big fucking deal

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
But you can't get these here, anywhere

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I've looked

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
In the factory in the Bay Area to find them

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Or Long's Drugs, apparently

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Go figure

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Sorry, random thought

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I was just looking at the golden shiny goodness

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Would you like one?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I would love one now

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Here you go, I'm bringing it over

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
It's like a pancake, it looks like a freaking pancake

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Hold up to the camera

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Those of you that are watching on Justin TV, I'll give you a cookie too

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
While Jamie reads the story

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Anyway, there is a very shaky teaser trailer

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Up for Guitar Hero Metallica

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Which I had been hearing

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Them speak of before

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So I don't think it's that far off

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
But it's saying

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
The trailer is supposed to come with Guitar Hero World Tour

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And it has

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
A Ride the Lightning

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
You know, 2009

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Something, so

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Cause that's not cheesy or anything

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
I think Metallica has finally

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Gotten off of their music

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And electronic distribution

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
And just said, cool

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Though they still have to do that

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
To be edgy, you know, but

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
They're going, so

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
And I do also have to say that the Metallica tracks

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
In Rock Band 2 are fucking hard

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Maybe they just like playing Rock Band

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
In Guitar Hero

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
So they decide, you know, when Guitar Hero comes and says

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Hey, we'll do a whole freaking

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Game about you guys

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And they're like, cool

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Or they saw what they did with Aerosmith and were like, we want that shit

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Well, and Metallica

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Is the epitome of awesome

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Rock before they sold out

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
So

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Well, I hope

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
For their sake that they learn

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
They learn from Guitar Hero

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Or not Guitar Hero

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
They learn from Rock Band and decide to

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Go ahead and allow each of those

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Games that they release separately

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
To be able to be downloaded

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
So that you can play tracks

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
In your Guitar Hero World Tour game

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Cause that would suck otherwise

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Especially if there's

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
A lot of games coming out like they were saying that they were gonna do

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
I don't know

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Oh well

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Well, something completely un-Guitar Hero related

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
South Peak

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Has now bought the small independent

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Game publishing company

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Gamecock

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Who apparently acts

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I don't know, they act crazy

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
But they do release a lot of

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Like a cock?

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Yes, crazy like the cock

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Apparently though, they release a lot of independent

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Games of course like

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I think actually

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
This week, I can't believe I forgot it

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Legendary

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Should be coming out

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
And that's one game that they're publishing as well as

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Velvet Assassin that's gonna be coming out later on

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I'm sorry, but they did that Pirates and Ninjas

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Dodgeball game that was horrible

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
No, that's South Peak, yeah

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
South Peak did, I'm talking about Gamecock

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I thought Gamecock did that game

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
No

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
I don't think they did

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
They're publishing it, whatever

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
They don't make the games, they just publish them

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Yes

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
The Pirates and Ninjas Dodgeball

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Maybe not exactly the glowing

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Example of their portfolio

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Legendary looked good

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
And Mushroom

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Sort of okay, but there's

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
A lot more games they're putting out

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And they're increasingly getting better

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So that's nice

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
South Peak on the other hand, they've been releasing

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Overlord

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
That's pretty cool

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Overlord is pretty sweet

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
They had some other stuff, X-Planes

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I think that was one of theirs as well

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I wonder if Bang Mini

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
One of the first orders of business at South Peak

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Is gonna be telling the guys at Gamecock to sit down

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
And shut up, cause you know, they're kinda

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Known for just making a lot of noise, you know what I mean

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
They just make noise, and some people don't

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Get it, like sometimes you kinda look at them and go

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
They're just kinda weird and need to shut up

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I don't think that they're like

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
I get the sense Gamecock kinda runs

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Themselves like a fraternity

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And for real, I get the sense

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
That they have raging kegger parties at some of their

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Company things, events, right

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
It seems like this giant gaming fraternity

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And I'm sure it's a fun as hell place to work

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
But sometimes you look at that and go

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Okay, they have to remember

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
That in every good frat party movie

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
That there's always a

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Montage sequence where they have to pull it

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Together and act a little bit less

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Like a fraternity and more like

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
A brotherhood and actually come together and do business

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Instead of just fuck around all the time

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And they haven't really gotten to that point

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
In the grand scheme of things

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Gameguru in chat wants to say

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
South Peak didn't have anything to do with

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball, Gamecock published it though

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I thought I saw their logo on that game

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And I'm sorry

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
We talked about this, I think

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Last week or two weeks ago when Dark Star Wars

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Classic Game of the Week was the dodgeball game for Neo Geo

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
That I thought

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
The Pirates vs Ninja game was kind of assy

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Compared to Neo Geo

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I thought it was a dumb idea to begin with

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Oh, Pirates vs Ninjas, we're gonna settle this match

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Once and for all with Dodgeball

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
And I'm like, lame

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Tune out

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
SSJ100Matt in chat says if Gamecock has

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Kager parties, then OLR has pie parties

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Not true, tonight is a flat fortune cookie party

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Pancake cookie

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
And they taste like pancakes too

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
They're delish

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They taste like yummy

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Awesometasticness

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Also pretty awesometastic

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Is the game Soul Calibur 4

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
But what is less awesome

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Is that we all saw this coming a mile away

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
They swore up and down

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Oh yeah, Darth Vader, Yoda, exclusive

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
To their respective consoles

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Even though there's that big gap in the character

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
List select screen

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
And there was video and screenshots of them playing

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
No, it's totally exclusive

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Well, sure enough, they've confirmed this week

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
That due to

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Overwhelming fan response

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Mhm

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
That soon you will be able to download

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Darth Vader and Yoda

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
In Xbox 360 and Playstation

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Three, you know, the respective versions

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
That are missing it

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
You'll be able to download them on October 23rd

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I'm not sure if that's a US or a Japanese date

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
But you know it's gonna happen everywhere

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I mean, come on

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
October 23rd, you know that's almost exactly three months

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
From the game's release

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
What a coinkydink

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
You've had an exclusive deal for

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Three months

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
It'll set you back $5

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
That's 400 Microsoft points

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Or in Sony terms, $5

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I'm sorry, in Sony terms, $4.99

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So you have

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Because Sony's not gonna like

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Do anything with that extra penny

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yes, isn't that wonderful

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
You have to put full amounts

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Full dollars into your account

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But they charge you $4.99

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So there's always a remainder

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Oh, cry

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You know, I'm a consumer whore

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I'll probably get it anyway

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Just charge even amounts, god, who cares

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
$4.99 may seem cheaper

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But seriously, people know how to do math

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
They understand it's only one cent cheaper

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I'm glad though

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I can say I told you so, I told you so

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
To my friend that said I have to get the Playstation 3

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Version of Soul Calibur because it's the only way I'll get to play

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Vader, and secretly I think

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
He just wanted to play me online

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And I'm like, just wait

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
There will be download content

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It's inevitable, and I'll bet you what

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
You know what, I bet you money

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I will bet you money, significant amount of money

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
This is not download content

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
It's pay to unlock content

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Money

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I posted a picture in the chatroom, by the way

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Of the view from where I sit

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Well, thank you for that

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
It's of Rob's head

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Oh, great

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And one of your pancake cookies

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Speaking of yummy

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Resistance 2

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Kids like aliens

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Kids should not be playing the game

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Because it is mature

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Oh

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
The beta

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
For Resistance 2

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Began on Friday

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
So

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
For those who got in, let us know how it is

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You know what you can tell us

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Some opinion here or there

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
It's going to be

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Going from

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Actually

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
The 20th of October

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
So I guess actually that's

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I'm sorry, that's in Europe

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
It's starting on Monday the 20th

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And it's going to be going on until Thursday

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
The 13th of November

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And there will be keys that are given out

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
From IGN, but there's no date

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
As to when those keys will be given out

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So keep your eyes on IGN for

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
A little bit more on that

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I like how the beta is going longer than actually the game

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
The game is coming out in the middle of the beta

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
That's the UK

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Dates

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Loki, you try to get into betas that you probably don't belong in

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Are you going to get into this one?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I'm not even going to try

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I didn't really play much

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Actually, I didn't play any of the multiplayer

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
In Resistance 1

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
In fact, I sold my copy back

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Yesterday

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
But you still enjoy the game, right?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Yeah, the game was awesome

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And I will plan on getting it

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I'll enjoy the game

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I'll have to wait a few weeks

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
There you go

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
But, yeah

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I don't know

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
The last few multiplayer betas I've been in

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Call of Duty 4 didn't really play much

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
What else did I get in?

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Battlefield Bad Company

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I didn't even play that at all

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I'm a horrible beta tester

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
For what it's worth, I played the Wrath of the Lich King beta once

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I went through all that patching and all that crap to play it once

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And that was it

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Doesn't that mean you don't have to patch it later?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
No, it was a completely separate thing

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
No, because you still have to buy the retail copy of it

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
And you know, they're going to change some things

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
From what was in the beta

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Well, it's finally here

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
For those people clamoring to play

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
A translation of Mother 3

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
You can now download the patch

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
For your ROM

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
That you may have of Mother 3

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Of course you would

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Need to have an import copy of the game

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Because, you know

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
To make it legit

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You can now download the patch

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
The update, which has been worked on

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
For a while now

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Is finally available

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So that's pretty awesome now that you get to play

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Mother 3, which, I don't know

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
I don't know why they don't just translate it

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Seriously, why do they refuse

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
To put that game out over here?

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I mean, it is literally

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
A refusal on Nintendo's part

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
To just put that game out here

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
And remember how

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
How long it

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
You know, the fans put effort into

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Doing second to three and we never got it

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
It's just weird how adamant they are

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I mean, I can't imagine it costs that much money

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
To translate, but maybe it's because then they have to

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Produce the game, I don't know, it's just

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
It's just sad

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
And you look at some of the stuff that is coming out from Nintendo

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
On these systems and you just go, why?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Personal training cooking

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
That is awesome

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Not only are they

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Little behind in putting that out

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Because there's going to be about four or five

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Other cooking games coming out around the same time

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
I don't think anyone's going to buy it

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I mean

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I'm sure there's people out there that actually

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Purchase every single Nintendo game that comes out

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
But, dude, seriously, you might start

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Questioning that

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Alright, one more story before we get to the classic

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Game of the week and get to our break tonight

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Hey ladies

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
If you're still looking for a Halloween costume

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
You know your gamer man

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
In your life might enjoy the sexy

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Lingerie

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
With Ms. Pac-Man's likeness on it

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
It will look like that

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are eating your boobies

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Because that's what this bra looks like

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Is that you actually have

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Just click on the show roll link

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And you can get this picture

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
But it looks, I mean, they're sexy little outfits

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I get that

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And I like how when the model

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I don't know what you want to call it

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Gladiator style skirt with little flaps

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And if you lift up the flaps

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It reveals Inky

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
One of the ghosts, or maybe it's Binky or Pinky

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
I don't know, but on your panties

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Right where your cooter is

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
So, nice little surprise there

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Like, ooh, ghost

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And I would like to point out

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
That the ghost is blue

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Which means it is an appropriate time

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
To munch it

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
For 200 points

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Anyway

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
3wishes.com is where you can

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Buy Ms. Video Game

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Hey, while you're at it

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You can also pick up their Chun-Li outfit if you'd like to

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I think I shall be

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Clicking on a linky

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Are you going to be buying

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Ms. Video Game for Dan this Halloween?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Not for Dan to wear, but for

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
No, I'll just be buying it for myself, it's freaking cool

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
There you have it

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
And no, listeners, you cannot

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
HasPix

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
No, you cannot

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Not just a no, but a hell fuck no

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Alright

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Hell fuck yes, though, to the classic game of the week

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Right, DarkSakura?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Hell fuck yes, let's check it out

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
We're going to travel gaming's history

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
To find a game that DarkSakura

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Thinks you all should be playing

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It's the classic game of the week

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And I think this week's classic game of the week

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Is probably one a lot of people have

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Played, I'm guessing

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
If they haven't, they suck

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Or maybe we're too young

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
To see it the first time

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
But you need to go find this game

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Right, DarkSakura?

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
We can get it on PSP, shit

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Alright, well, tell us about it

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
What is this week's classic game of the week?

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
We have two games, but they're together, one's a sequel

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
It's Parappa the Rapper

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
And Parappa the Rapper 2

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Parappa

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
How do you not know this song?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Seriously, the demo came with what?

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I think it was on one of the old Sony magazines

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
It was, and I played the fuck out of it?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Anyway

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
You basically play

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
It's all done in sort of a 2D flat style

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
For all the characters

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And you play as a little dog named Parappa

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Who has to believe, because I gotta believe

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
And basically

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
He goes around rapping

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Against different people

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
So it's really a music rhythm game

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
It's like Simon Says, really

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Where they, the words that

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Whichever the masters that you're going against

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Their words have a pattern of button presses

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
And then you have to repeat it for yours

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Or do something that corresponds

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
That's actually more Parappa 2

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
And of course the better you do

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
The better your score

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
If you start sucking, then

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
You go to bad, you're not rapping cool

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
If you get from

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Rapping good to rapping cool

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Then the stage just completely goes off

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
And you take over and you just have to keep pressing buttons

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Randomly until the stage is over

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Which was actually the only way I passed the stage

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
From Jeremy Lammy, which we'll get to later

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
The game was made by

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Masaya Matsura

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Who was

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Actually

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
One of the, the leader of the Hyperpop unit

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
For

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
But he was also, the company

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
That brought out the game was Nana Oncha

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
So

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
If anyone remembers

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Nana Nana Nana Nana Oncha

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I played this game literally a million times

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
And Unchan Malami

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I love these games

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
You have the meter like I was saying before

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You have the rapping good

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
That's when you're doing okay

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
When you're doing as you're expected to

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
If you're rapping bad, the music gets a little worse

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
If you're rapping awful, it's just

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Depressing sounding

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And the stage is rain

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And it gets awful

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
And the better you do, it starts going back to normal again

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
You know, like you'll have this little

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Minor, you know, chord

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Baseline to it

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
So

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
The art was done by Rodney Greenblatt

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And um

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
He's got a website that's just got

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Tons of his art

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
But it also did have a sequel

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Which we're getting to the music of next time

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
And we will hear the music from the sequel right now

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Well this is just the start of it

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
This is from Parappa 2

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I didn't put Unchan Malami in here

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
While even though it plays the same

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
It feels differently, I think, don't you agree?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Yeah, I mean it is a different game

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It's like um

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
It's not a sequel but an equal, if that makes sense

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Yeah, and um

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Unchan Malami and friends make an appearance in this game

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
But I had to pick the best music in

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Parappa 2

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
I think we get a cut scene with this one

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
I don't know if it goes straight into the song

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Hey everybody, watch out for those flying noodles

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Cause if you don't do well here

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
All you get to eat are noodles

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And here we go

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So you can find Sister Mustachio

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I will

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
But anyway, the reason why I had to put Parappa 2 up on there

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Is because the music is just

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
A lot better

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Different styles

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I really love the Parappa 2 soundtrack

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
And um

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
But I had to pick that particular level

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Cause there's one stage where Parappa has to trap himself

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
In a video game or else everybody in the universe has to eat noodles forever

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And that's

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
As far as I'll say without spoiling the rest of the story of the game

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
If you haven't played it

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
God knows why you haven't

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
But um

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It also really goes there

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
A lot more stylistically

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
As far as having stages

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Where you change perspective

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Within your 3D environment

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Like the

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Ant guru

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Or um

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
You know where you uh

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
That's the first Parappa

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Oh I thought you wanted this movie show

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
The one from Parappa 2

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
What stage number was it?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
4 I think

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Well this is one of my favorite songs from Parappa

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:58.000
When I say boom boom boom

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
You say bam bam bam boom

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
When I say boom boom boom

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I love this song

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
If you sort of freestyle a little bit with it

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It increases your score

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And if it's good enough

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That shoots you into cool mode

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Pretty much

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
You know so

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Now going back to this I mentioned it before

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Is um

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
That there is a PSP version

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
And I happen to look into my copy for about 13 bucks

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
When a Hollywood video

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Is going out of business

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Um

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But uh

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
It's the same thing

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
You've got lots of different versus modes in it

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Um jammerlami

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
We will definitely be

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Yeah here's another one

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And who can forget the bathroom rap in the first game?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
God I know

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Um especially as often as it's been quoted

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Um

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
But this is why I think that um

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Parappa 2 though

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
If you can just listen to the difference between

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
How much more complex the music is

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
I really like it a lot better personally

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Um

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Jammerlami was another

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Game that's in the same vein

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
And I was saying I'll probably cover it

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
On another one because it honestly is

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
I think different enough

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Within the style of music that it can qualify

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
As a different game

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
But there was Parappa mode in it

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And Parappa mode was pretty freaking cool

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Because it turned all these rocking songs into rap

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Um

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
There are some differences

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Um

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
A few lines that were changed

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
As far as

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
You know one released to the other

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Um

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
There was an anime

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
A Parappa anime that I thought was really really cute

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Um it came out

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
In Japan it actually has a really cool little intro song to it too

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Um

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
But for anyone

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
When I was speaking about the uh

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Um

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
I was talking to a guy named Rodney Greenblatt

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
His uh website

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Is um

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Wednesdayload.com

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
W-H-I-M-S-Y

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Load L-O-A-D dot com

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
That's all one word dot com

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Um and

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
While his artwork may seem fairly simplistic

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
He's got some really nice and complex stuff on there

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Uh some uh

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Uh sculpture

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Um different uh

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
You know medium he uses

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Work you know

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Given you know my recent educational career

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I know all the lyrics to these today

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I remember driving around San Francisco one time after

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Picking up somebody and um

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
He had brought the CD and we listened to it

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
In the Rain or in the Snow

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Um

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
We've often referred to as um

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
The After Effects of certain

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Eating at Gem Boys as

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
The Funky Flow

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Nice

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Um really not joking

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
But um

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
That's their game

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Parappa and Parappa 2

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
There you go here classic game of the week

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Parappa the Rappa and it's sequel Parappa the Rappa 2

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Two for the price of one

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I couldn't mention one without mentioning the other

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Right it's like a necessity

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Personally I like the second

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Parappa better

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
As a game and music wise

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
But you cannot mention the second

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
One without mentioning the one that started

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
At all right you know

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
You sure cannot alright there you have it

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Your classic game of the week and that means it's break

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Time folks and when we come back we haven't even

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Really touched a lot of the Microsoft news going on in the world

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Microsoft might be giving out

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Some free memory cards

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Soon so we're going to be talking about that when we come back

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
From this break and some other stuff

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Including that story I referenced a little bit earlier

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
About something in a game that pisses me off a little bit

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
And this is something

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
We actually found ourselves

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio you will not have read about

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
This on any blogs yet

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Kind of some I guess you could say exclusive news

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
But I don't like using that term it's just kind of one of those

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
You may not have heard of this yet

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
We'll be talking about it in part B when we come back

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:28.000
After this break

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Hail to the king baby

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Hey welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
And thanks J-Rod for that new little commercial there

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
I love it when other people do the commercials for us

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
If you have a promo you want to run for your

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Nonprofit website or if you have a

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Podcast you want to plug that's independent

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
You can always send us a commercial

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Or if you just want to do something cool for Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Like J-Rod did

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
You can put that together and send it to us

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
At Orange Lounge Radio there's more information available on the forums

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Meanwhile we're coming back to our show

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
After a pretty fun first half

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Which I must say for this show

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Was surprisingly intelligent

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Considering we were talking about the Quran

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
And the controversy around the little big planet

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And all that

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I think we're pretty smart

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
So this is the Oscar clip

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Tonight's episode

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Episode number 299

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
It's going to be a big show next week

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Hey that fart over there must be

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Mean that Fart Princess

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Is joining us here in studio

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Who just surprised us

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
By joining us during the break I had no idea you were coming tonight

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Hi Fart Princess how are you?

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Hi I was just supplementing the Oscar material

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Oh thank you

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
And by the way she's no longer Rice Princess

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
She's Fart Princess

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
You're a liar

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
And also joining us tonight

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
I haven't seen you in a long time

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Now what are we calling you these days?

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
It used to be Casper the Gay

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
But I now go by The Doctor

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Now The Doctor

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
I've got a Sonic Screwdriver right here

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Oh and our guests are extremely loud tonight

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I'm very sorry

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I left mine at home

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I'll adjust the volume

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
As we move in

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
We actually have a listener called The Doctor too

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And now there's going to be some confusion

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Let me see your Sonic Screwdriver

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
You've got the little one?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
It's not Sonic then

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
No but after the show

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
I'm going to play with Captain Jack's Sonic Screwdriver

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Oh my

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Oh my

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
You know that's actually what I was planning on doing for Halloween

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Is getting a blue suit

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
And tie and wearing my con verses

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And going as Chick Doctor

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Oh my god that'd be so awesome and then we would match

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Because I'm going to be Doctor Who as well

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
I've got the black ones

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I was actually either going to do the blue suit

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Or do a different color suit and be Chick Doctor

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
That'd be so awesome

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
It's nice to have guests in the studio it's been a long time

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Especially considering episode 300 of this program

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
If you can believe it is next week

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Oh my

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Yeah episode 300 is next week

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Oh my

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And we're doing nothing special for it except soliciting congratulations

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
And whatever memories from our listeners

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
On 877 Game OLR when we're not live

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
You should do something special

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
We might do some games next week

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
So you kids should come back

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
So there you have it

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
This is some gaming news if you guys want to comment on the news

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
You have a microphone feel free to comment

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Just refrain from fart noises fart princess

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Do we need more fart noises?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Alright

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I love that I come back from break

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
And talk about what an intelligence show we're having tonight

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
And then fart princess shows up

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
To fuck the whole thing up

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
What are you talking about?

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
What?

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
What?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
What?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
What?

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
We have to go from extremes

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
We have to keep the listeners guessing

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
And Rob?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
There's the show I was missing somehow

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And Rob?

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Yeah great

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Oh how much lower can we go? Yes

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Did you ever see that skit on the state where they had the high brow side

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
And the low brow side

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Shifting over to the low brow side

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
I think I vaguely remember yes

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
The state was a cool show

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I had the guy who had to put his balls and stuff

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Can we get back to the news please?

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
No we're supposed to make the show crappy now

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
Loki some gaming news for the love of god

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
So yes

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
There is this rumor

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Going around that the next

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Xbox system

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Will be forwards compatible

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Yeah I know you've heard

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
All about backwards compatibility

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Oh but we got the brand new forwards

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Compatibility

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
It will play the games of the future

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
No really what it means is it will

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
And I think this technology is already available now

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
It will make your Xbox

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
360 games better

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Same you know either at a higher

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Resolution or

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Make them play smoother

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I don't know like the Playstation

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Isn't that the exact same fucking thing

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
The 360 was supposed to do to original

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Xbox games? And it does to a certain

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Extent it does you know

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Smooth out the graphics a little bit

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And it also

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
You know kind of up rezzes it

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
A little bit same with the Playstation 2

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
It kind of made it a little bit smoother

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Decreased loading times

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Depending on which option you chose

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
So how is this any different

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Than backwards compatibility? In fact I would say

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
It's exactly the same as backwards compatibility

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Just with a different name to it

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Because obviously your Xbox 360 is not going to be able to play

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
New games

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
I don't know I'll tell you the last system that had

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
True forwards compatibility was the Dreamcast

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And I'll tell you why

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Because with every new game

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
They would load a new version of Windows CE

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
That would have an improved running environment

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
For each game that came out subsequent

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
So in that respect

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
That's forward compatibility

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
We haven't had a system do that since

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
But it's also firmware updates

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And you know they have those

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Available now and you know with

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Each firmware update it could make your

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
System run smoother

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Isn't it just a bunch of

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Marketing mumbo jumbo?

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It is a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo and rumor

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Marketing mumbo jumbo might I add

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
So who cares

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
The system isn't going to be out for a while

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Anyways and we'll listen to all the marketing

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Mumbo jumbo when that actually happens

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Moral of the story?

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Sega is awesome

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
I'm not sure how we got to that but okay

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Dreamcast

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Let's read some comments from chat

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Our first half of the show tonight was missing

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Too much of the chat room. Let's get some comments from chat

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Make up for it part B here

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Redertainment says forwards compatibility sounds like

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
New things can be promoted and such

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Backwards compatibility sounds old and dated

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
So like with forwards compatibility

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yoda and Vader will already be unlocked

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Is that what it is?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Maybe?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
You don't even know what the hell I'm talking about

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I'm sorry we're like acting right now

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Alright

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
By the way if you're not watching Justin TV

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
All rice princess and the doctor

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Are doing are beating each other up on cam

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
For your entertainment so check that out

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
That's all we're doing

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Hey I want to talk about a little bit of news

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
And actually this might be something you guys might have an opinion on

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
I don't know and this is not out there yet

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
This news is not out there yet

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
This actually was my buddy Shane

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
You know he's been on the show here before

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Plenty of times he actually works at a game store

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And he sent me a picture

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
From a strategy guide coming out for Fable 2

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
And it's the Brady Games

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Strategy guide for Fable 2

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
And there's a section in it that talks about clothing

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
There are plenty of quality

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Tailors scattered throughout the cities of

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Albion and most of them are

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I'm sorry and each of them are

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Cable of crafting some fine handmade clothing

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Etc, etc, etc. Let me get to this part

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Many items are unisex

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
But those that are designed

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Specifically for one sex

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Carry a cross-dressing rating

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Should the other sex wear them

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Heroes wishing to experiment with gender

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Play should consider wearing up

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Clothes of the opposite gender

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Especially if looking to start a same

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Sex relationship

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Interesting

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
So that's what I can infer from this

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
From the strategy guide

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Is that in Fable 2

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
If you want to start a same sex relationship

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Because you know the game will allow you to basically

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Have whatever types of relationships you want

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
The way to do that is by cross-dressing

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
You have to trick them

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Apparently

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
That's wrong

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
That's crazy

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
This is what I was talking about in the first half

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Where even I looked at this and I went

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
Okay I'm a little bit offended by this

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Because we've been trying to combat

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
For years and years and years

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
When they splash images of the pride parade on the news

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And that's what people think

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
The culture is all about

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Well some of us don't even like that kind of stuff

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
And it's like

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Nobody applies logic

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
It's like you're gay and you like men

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Not women

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Hello

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
That's like the epitome of being gay

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Hello

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
And maybe I'm just being a little hypersensitive about this

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
And letting the trigger figure go off

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Too soon on this and being offended

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
But I'm just kind of like come on people

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Is this really the way the game

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Has to be designed is that if I want to impress

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
People of the same gender I have to cross-dress

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
I'm sure the designers will come back and say

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Well you don't have to cross-dress

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
You don't have to do it

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But I'm sure it improves your chances and to me that's wrong

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Yeah no and it's just

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I'm not mad about it

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Yeah it's dumb

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
That's what people think though because it's like

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
This one girl in a club was like

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Oh do you wear panties and I'm like

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm not a woman

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
I don't wear panties

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
No that's what they make mantis for

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Yeah maybe mantis

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Well it's

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
For all we know

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And I don't know how much further

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
Into the strategy guide he looked at it

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
It could be possible

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
That maybe it's just a small

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
No apparently later in the guide

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Each article of clothing

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Is actually has like a cross-dress rating

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Okay

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So cross-dressing is a facet of the game

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And I don't know if it's the guide

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I don't know if it's the game

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
I'm assuming the guide is just reporting on how the game was designed

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
You know what I mean but that sentence to me

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Stings the way they say that

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
Is that if you want to improve your chances

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
In a same-sex relationship you gotta cross-dress

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Then make it sound like that's an integral part of it

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Reddertainment in chat says

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Can I attract people of the opposite gender while cross-dressing

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Dude I know in real life

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
There's a lot of women that do find that hot actually

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Hell yeah

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
A man who's comfortable with their sexuality

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
All the teenage guys that go to cosplay dressed as like Japanese school girls

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Like I'm sure there's a lot of chicks there

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
That get off on that

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
I almost became a cosplay stalker

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
Because of this one guy dressed as Utena

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
There you go

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
And he looked freaking gorgeous

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I was like I'm gonna follow you now

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Oh my

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
AcidicVampire in chat says

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
At least you can have a same-sex relationship in The Sims

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
Exactly I think The Sims is a game that does it right

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
The game is not about

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Same-sex relationships

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
The game does not force you to do same-sex relationships

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
It's just there

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Just like in real life

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Or like in Bully

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
In Bully you have to dress up a little bit

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
You have to wear your aqua-weary vest to get a kiss from a guy

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
But that's not too bad

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Well at that point it was just like

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
We'll take what we can get

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Sauce brought up Manfay

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And she can

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
She can put Manfay right away

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Nobody is attracted to Manfay

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Okay that's

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
You don't want to know

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
The doctor just asked what is Manfay

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Did you watch Cowboy Bebop?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
No he doesn't

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Don't even bring up the picture please

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Rob do it

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
We need a reaction shot

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
This is radio

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Can you describe what Manfay is while I pull up the picture in chat here

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
The character Fay in Cowboy Bebop

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Has been cosplay

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Yes a woman

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Has been cosplayed

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
By many pretty women

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And one hairy man

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
That is Manfay

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Rob share the picture in the chat room please

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Sailor Bubba is a close second

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Oh yeah, oh god

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Shut her

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
There you have it

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
I've been at conventions

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Where Manfay has been present

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And see look look

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Manfay we're all sitting here and laughing at

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And that's why I don't like this in the game

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Because we sit there and laugh at crossdressers

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
I don't know

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
And I don't think that should be associated with same sex

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
This one person is

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It's crossplay

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Crossplay I like that

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I know plenty of female cosplayers

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Who do male characters

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
To comedic effect

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And that's hot

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Sometimes

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I've even considered doing a couple of costumes myself

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I wanted to go as Richter one year

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
You know with the Ryu hairband look

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And everything

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
But you know I have a friend of mine who's very tall

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Who went as

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Larva from Vampire Princess Mio

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
So

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Alright Shauran in chat says

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
My friend saw Manfay at her first con

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
I feel so bad for her

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Alright getting away from Manfay and all this funny stuff

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
For right now

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
We were talking about the other story

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
You know it's hard for me to sit here and go

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
People should not find this offensive

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
When in the same breath I'm looking at this story

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And I'm going you know what I'm kind of sort of offended

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
At this story

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I think it's different though

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
It is but I can't put my finger on it

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Why should I be offended

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
The difference being is that

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
This is a specific component

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Integral to the game

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
This is something programmed specifically

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Into the game

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
As a facet of gameplay

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
The other is background music

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
That was made

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
By someone of that faith

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
It's

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Now if that had been programmed in by

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
The most flaming of all gay people ever

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Would you be as offended

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Yes

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Because I think that person should know better

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Okay but if that person

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Personally thought it was

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Funny and wondered why people would be offended

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
I mean I'm not like offended

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Offended is not the word

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I'm disappointed

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I'm disappointed that it's 2008

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
And this is what I'm reporting on

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
Is that cross-dressing in the game will help your chance

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
With same sex relationships

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Can't we just move on

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Why can't it just be

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
If this game wants to be so big

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
You have the character you want

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And you program the same way

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Why can't you just be

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Why can't you just be the hero

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
With muscles and I don't know

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Whatever wearing manly clothes

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
That attracts a lot of women

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
And 10% of men

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
You know what I mean

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Why can't we just have that

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
You know what I think it should be

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
And keep in mind also

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Not everyone who cross-dresses

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Is gay

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
We know this

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Not everyone who

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Who is gay cross-dresses

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
Also importantly true

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Exactly and there are people

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Who want to be that gender

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I think that if they were

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Going to incorporate something like that in the game

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
And true it would be some very

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Complex programming I do believe

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
It should be

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
That you have the option of how you are going

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
To make use of that option

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
You know what I mean

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
If you want to cross-dress because you want to be a woman

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
You should have that as an option

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I want boobs

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Solid Goomba in chat says I want to be a man

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
In a dress and have a relationship with a woman

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
More power to you

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I do think the game should allow that

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
If that's what you want

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
You know what I mean I don't think cross-dressing should have a bearing on it

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I don't know maybe I'm just

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Maybe I just need to cool it but it just seems a little silly to me

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
And you know if the designers

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Take issue with how I'm reporting on that

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Well look at the strategy guy the official strategy guy for the game

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
That's where it comes from

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
I agree that's boring

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
It's like oh my god we got another flamer

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Is the gay character in the game you know I don't know

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
People need to get on with it

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I'm just kind of getting sick of it

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Like one of these days I would just like to have

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
A normal person

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Who happens to be gay in my video game

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Just like you know in TV and all that

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
You know and even if sexuality

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Is not a part of the game's device at all

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Then fine we have no defined sexuality

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
In the game that's just fine by me

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
But amongst these RPG love stories I would like

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
One day for there to be

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
A same gender one that is not stupid

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
If that makes sense

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
And you know that actually

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Goes back to what I was talking about

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
About the sort of

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
A

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Singular directional bigotry

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
You know what I mean

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I think that

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Every you know

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Every relationship is going to have its moments

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Of dysfunction

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Every relationship is you know some may have

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
A very odd origin you know

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I ordered my husband on the internet

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
You know

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
I think that

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
It doesn't have a quirk to it

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
The quirk should be there because of the people involved

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Not because of their orientation

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Right

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Um

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Just one other thing though

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I think though that having

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
An active

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
You know I don't even think it should be

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
An active choice I think you should just

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Start up your character and be born gay or not

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Because really isn't that

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
For the most part you know

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I think it's genetic

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Progress

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
I think that

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
As far as it being a part that does

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Determine a lot of who your character

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Is

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
But it does not

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Define who your character is

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Um let me read some comments in chat here real quick

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Because they're good

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Acidic vampire says play indigo prophecy

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
There's a normal quote unquote

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Gay male in it

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
And no I haven't and that's one of those Xbox games

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
That like I should have played but I never did

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Fair but you know I guess maybe we

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Need a little more of that

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
SG100Matt says I'm still waiting on a video game

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Hero who happens to be Jewish

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Fair enough

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
But how often does religion come into video games

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Of course then again

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Saying all that with what we talked about earlier

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
But you know just

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
And then immediately follows

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
That up and says just because they always grab coins

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Doesn't mean they're Jewish

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
See

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I like that you can have a little fun with it

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Alright

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Look let's just move on

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
And you know everybody's talking about

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
They want to see representation of themselves

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
GS68 I want more Filipino

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Filipina characters dammit

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I'm sure there's a lot of people saying I want to see a little more

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Of this in games so maybe it's time

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
For diversity the game

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I don't know it's a small world the game

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Who knows I don't know

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Let's move on there's plenty more gaming news to talk about

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
If you want to talk more about it email us

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Call us later

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Take us to a game that has nothing to do with sexuality, religion or race at all

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
This one's about falling into holes

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
That could be construed as sexuality

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Yeah but how many holes do people really fall into

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
I tripped there's a vagina

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
You might wake up with a hangover

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I think I fell into a hole while I was drunk

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Anyway sorry go ahead

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Okay anyway

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Portal Still Alive

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Is going to be on the Xbox Live arcade

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
It will be

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
It will

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Be up on Wednesday October 22nd

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
And

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
It has the

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
One that came out

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Earlier

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Plus 14 new exclusive

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Challenge maps

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
And 6 advanced maps

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And new achievements

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
So in other words if you bought the orange box

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Just for this game

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Haha sucker you're going to buy it twice

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
But is Portal a game that you really

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Mind buying twice I mean it is pretty freaking good

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
There are different levels to be fair

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Yeah to be fair I know

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
There needs to be more GLaDOS

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
On the PC

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
First there will be cake and then you will be baked

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
There's no story in the extra levels right?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
They're just kind of there

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
It's just more crazy

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Will you be taunted by GLaDOS in these bonus levels or are they just extra puzzles or something?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
What's the point of not being taunted?

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I don't know

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
That's why I'm curious to see like

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
How

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
How milked is this game?

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
That's what I want to see like are they really just milking it

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Or did they actually put a little thought into it?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
That's what I'm really curious to see

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Who knows

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Well

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
One thing that you can probably store that brand new game on

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Would be a hard drive

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Or a new memory unit

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
And remember Microsoft was saying with the new

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Xbox experience

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
That you would need some sort of storage

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Device in order to download it because it does take

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
128 megs of space

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Well their solution

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
For people that

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I don't know how they went about

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Existing with an Xbox with no storage whatsoever

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Because that means you can't save games or anything

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
They are offering

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
A free 512 megabyte memory unit

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Or for 20 bucks

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
You can buy a 20 gigabyte hard drive

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Now in order to qualify for this

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
You have to have a core system

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Or some arcade systems

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
May qualify as well

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Basically just go to their

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Website

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
They have available for that

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Which is xbox.com

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Go to their support page

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
And there is a memory update thing

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Where you enter your serial number and console ID

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Into the program

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
And if you are eligible

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Let you buy them

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
If you are not eligible and you happen to have an arcade system

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
That's the other option

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
For $29.99 you can get a 20 gig hard drive

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
And a 3 month live card

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Which is not a bad deal either

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Now my question

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
When I got my xbox 360

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
I have a core

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Because I got my system during that time

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
When xbox 360s were really hard to find

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So I just ponied up the 20 extra dollars

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Or whatever it was to buy the hard drive

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
And the core system separately

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
So is Microsoft going to know that I have had a hard drive this whole time

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Or do you think you will qualify for this

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Sweet! I get a free memory card

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Right?

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Awesome!

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I'm good! Why not? It's free!

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Microsoft doesn't know that I have a hard drive

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
And even though I do

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Why should I be treated differently

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
From the other owners that bought the core

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
Early on, early adopters

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Yeah!

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
For 20 bucks you can get a 20 gig hard drive

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
That could just be the drive I install

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Final Fantasy XI on and never use

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Or it could be

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Or better yet

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Because I only have a 20 gig hard drive as it is now

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
I could have two drives and one of them

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Can be like the movies drive

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Or it could be the games drive

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Why not?

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
To be honest, I think that's an awesome solution

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
For their problem

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
And really, I mean

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Who would not have a hard drive

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Or a memory unit

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
I mean, seriously, I could see some people that may have

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
Only a 64 megabyte memory unit

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
Say they bought it back when the

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
Xbox 360 came out and stuff

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
And they're only using it for, say, save games

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
But, I mean

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I can't imagine someone that would have

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
An Xbox 360 that actually plays games

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
That you have to progress in

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
That does not have a way to save their game

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Because that would be kind of retarded

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
You have to start over every time

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
I didn't even know they made Xboxes without memories

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Well, they don't anymore

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
I have several people telling me in chat and

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Aim and everywhere that, hey, Microsoft's gonna hear

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
What you just said and you're screwed

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
But, actually, it may even be before that

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
No, it's not

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
Henderson Man in chat says, Sky, I have a core

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
But it would not let me have a free memory card

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
That's from Henderson Man in chat

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
I don't think it's gonna, eh

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Now I'm really curious, I'm gonna try it

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I'll let you guys know what happens next week

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Well, I've got about five different ones we can try

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
We'll see what happens

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I do, actually, I want to get a bigger hard drive

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
But if I can get a 20 gig hard drive

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Another one for cheap, I'll do that switch out idea

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
I think it's a great idea

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So, we'll see

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Anyhow, thank you, Microsoft

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
For giving us some free stuff

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Right?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Alright, moving on to some more news

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And talking about the Xbox 360

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
A little further, and the Zune

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
I don't know how many folks out there actually own Zunes

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I know it's got a loyal following

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
There's a few people out there that own the Zunes

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
But, you know, they're

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
They're trying to increase

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
The amount of flexibility that

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Or, I should say, compatibility that occurs between the two

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
You know, with the media sharing

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
And, you know, the things that go on between the 360 and the Zune

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
Well, actually, recently

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Some folks were

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Over at Gizmodo were talking about the new Gears of War

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Zune that's coming out

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
And they were actually talking to Microsoft's marketing director

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
And the marketing director

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Was talking about that there is going to be a big

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Step up

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Happening in the Zune 360 integration within

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
A year

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
So, that's all, it's a very vague statement

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
But that supposedly

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
It's going to step it up within a year

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Any thoughts as to what that could possibly be?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Well, they already have the XNA

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Support that's supposed to be coming to it

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
They're going to flesh that out a little bit more

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
And maybe it would be kind of cool

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
They actually put some games on there

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Like, you know, they could even be like

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
The Pocket Station stuff where you play a little mini game

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
You earn points for a game or something

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I have a thought, and I bet money I'm right

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Movies

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
You're going to be able to play movies on the Zune that you bought on Xbox

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I could see that happening

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
It's going to be how they're going to compete with iPod

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Rob

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Remember when they were talking about the Zune E3?

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Right

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Didn't they bring up something to that effect

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
That it would be like a multi-entertainment

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I remember going in there with my camera

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
And them telling me to turn it off

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
At the Xbox 360 thing

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
And they were talking about having portable content

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
So perhaps this is what they intended

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Cobra Kid says more XNA games to it in chat

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
That's true, they have that whole XNA thing coming out soon

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
That could be a big part of it too

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
So maybe it's all of it

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
It could be just as much as the iPhone interfaces

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
With your Mac or even your personal computer

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Maybe the Zune will interface with the Xbox 360

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Who knows

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Will there be enough people that use it

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Or just a quick question in chat

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Let's say the Zune could do all of those things you suggested

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Let's say the Zune can do the XNA games

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Let's say the Zune can do the movies

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
And all that stuff

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Would you be interested in a Zune chat room

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
As opposed to an iPhone

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Or any of the other stuff that's out there

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Let's say you can only have one player

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Would you pick Zune

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Comment from Tigerclaw

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Tigerclaw says doesn't the Zune have built in Wi-Fi

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
They could make apps for it

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
Like for example someone would eventually make an internet radio app

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
To tune into the shotcast streams over the Wi-Fi

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
We'll see

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
We'll come back to that story

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Just after we get this next story out of the way

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
This actually makes me a little bit happy

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Even though I already own the game

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
On multiple platforms

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Marvel vs Capcom 2

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Which

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Honestly I thought the first one was a little bit better

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
But um

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
It actually has an ESRB rating now

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
For PS3 and Xbox 360

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
So that leads speculation

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
That it's going to be a

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Downloadable version

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Maybe like a

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Xbox Live Arcade

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Or something like that

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
And that's pretty cool

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
I mean it's a good game

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
So I'm looking forward to that

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
It's a fucking awesome game you mean

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
By good

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
It's all about

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Playing a Strider hear you anyway

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Okay looking at chatroom comments

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
From the last story because we asked you guys would you get one

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And would you get a Zune if they

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Implemented all these features

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
VxJsonXV says Zunes blow

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Rama says yes

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
GameGuru says maybe but I'm more interested in PSP right now

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Sharan says sure why not

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
VxJsonXV continues I have my iPhone

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
And I'm happy with it

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Redertainment says does it do much better than my current touch

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
If not no I need a gross incentive to jump over

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
That's how I feel

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
There's got to be something really big to get me to have a Zune

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
As well as an iPhone

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Cobra Kid says I would have to get a bigger Zune

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Deekman says I'm telling you they'll merge the music card and the gamer tag

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
I didn't even think of that

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
That could be so we'll see

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Alright

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
So Marvel vs Capcom 2 hopefully coming soon

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
As it says

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Meanwhile some other news

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Right Loki?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Sorry someone was stepping on my mic

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Are our guests being unruly?

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
They are being very unruly

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
They need to be punished

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
We're playing naughty tic tac toe

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Anyways

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
If you live in Europe you're going to

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Be in for a lot of holiday bundles

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
For the Xbox 360

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
They are getting quite a few

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
In fact starting

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Well last week actually

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
The value packs that are available

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Pretty much all around the world

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Are available for them as well

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
That includes of course the games packed in

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
For both the Elite and Pro

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
And the Sega Superstar Tennis

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
And of course the Xbox Live arcade games

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Starting

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Looks like

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
November 7th

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
They're going to be getting two more bundles

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Both with the 60GB Pro system

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
And either Gears of War 2 bundled in

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Or James Bond 007 Quantum of Solus bundled in

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
And those are going to both be available

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
For 269 euros

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Starting

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
The 21st of November

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
There's going to be another one with

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Tomb Raider Underworld

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
And that's also a Pro system

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
The 60GB with a 1200

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Microsoft points card

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
And that's also available for 269 euros

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
And then finally

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
The Last Stitch effort before Christmas

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
There's another 60GB Pro system

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Bundled with

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
Prince of Persia

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And that will also be for 269 euros

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
So

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
A little bit more expensive than your normal games

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Your normal Lake Pro system

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I mean

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Basically you're kind of paying for the game itself

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
Anyways

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
But hey that's kind of neat

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I guess if you're shopping for the holidays

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Lots and lots to pick from

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Why do you think so many bundles over there

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
Are supposed to here?

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
I think it may have been just

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
And I'm not even sure if it's actually

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
It could very well be

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Like different

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Say bundles that are being

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Done by retailers and stuff like that

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
I don't know if these are official

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Or what the case may be

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I don't know it's interesting

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
I guess

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Alright well hey one game that they aren't

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Bundling in right now is Castle Crashers

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Maybe someday

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Some people will tell you Castle Crashers is still borked

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
That it's online multiplayer mode is still

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Not that great and we've been waiting and waiting

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And waiting for a patch well

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Guess what Behemoth the developer of the game

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Has just posted on their site this week that

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
They have figured out how to fix the problem

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
They have finished the patch and it is

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Currently waiting on certification

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
For Microsoft I'm sorry they are currently verifying

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
The updates and then they're going to be sending it off to Microsoft

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
For certification which has probably

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Already happened

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Kind of took them long enough in a way

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
I mean with as long as this game took

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
To come out I mean couldn't they just kind of like

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
Fix this before it came out

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
I mean I don't know I guess you know they didn't know

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
They tested the game they didn't find it

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Mistakes happened blah blah blah

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
But it's a little bit frustrating this game has been out how long

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
And you still can't really have a multiplayer game on it

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
But I guess to their credit

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
You know a lot of people bought this game anyway

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
And hearing about this patch is just going to cause

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Another wave of people

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Running out to get this game

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Whereas a lot of Xbox Live Arcade titles kind of have

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
One shot the week they come out

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
And then they kind of slip into obscurity

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Maybe it was pre-planned who knows

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I doubt it though

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Alright

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Well something pre-planned on Orange Lounge Radio is that

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Every week we are going to take some time to read your

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Emails that you send us to mailbag at

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Why are you boycotting the mailbag?

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I will get you a damn cookie if you read the emails

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Hey FartPrincess

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Doctor do you guys want

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I have flat fortune cookies

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
They taste like pancakes

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Oh my

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
Well Dark Soccer reads us some email

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
There is an email that I should have sent in response

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
To you directly Rob

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
And I don't know if I should read it on air

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
Well if you read this first

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Then I am going to have to wait on the cookies

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Okay you can just read it at your leisure

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Well give me a brief idea of what it's about

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
It's from Spazinator

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Hi

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Telling you what games you should get for PS3

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
Oh

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Didn't I say, I think I said a while back

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
About something like I need more

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Games that I should

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
What games?

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
LocoRoco

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Cocorecto

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
How are there, Lemmings, Elephunk

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
EchoChrome, WipeoutHD

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Everyday Shooter, Super Puzzle Fight

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Are you farting glasses?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
What are you doing?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Knock it off

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Trying to do a show

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Wait did they just list

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Every game that's not

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
A list of 36 games Rob

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
Just basically all the PS3 exclusives

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Some

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Some are not

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
To be fair I am going to get a PS3

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
LittleBigPlanet is out

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Sooner rather than later

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
There is more tips on what else you should get along with

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
And what you should look for

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
I am having surgery soon

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
So you know

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Probably having a blu-ray player will be a good thing

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
As they recover

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
So let's go on to the next email

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
While I go get the cookies

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
The next email

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Is actually from

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Did you lose a sock?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
No I know where my socks are

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Cookie!

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Bye

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Now

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Rob

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Heart

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
We love you

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
So excited for the cookies

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Okay

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Never mind I was told not to

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Read this email on the air

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
So I've already addressed this situation

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Multiple times before

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
So stop reminding me I know

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Heart

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
And then

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
We only really have one other email

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
And it's actually

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
From

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Dan Shadow

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Hey guys my nephew's birthday

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Was last week so I missed the show

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Took him to the movie of his choice

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And he chose, wait for it, quarantine

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Yeah it sucked so bad

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I mean it was so bad

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
That people would start talking during the movie and no one

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
Cared, fucking rabies

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
Anyways

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Been trying to catch up on my OLR since I had

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
To leave in the middle of another episode

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Just got one episode on Friday

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
And I'm sure

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
I guess you meant to have the word

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Rob

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
I'm on the last email

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Rob's gay

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I'm sure I'll get the other one soon

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Been playing Dead Space this week

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I recommend it to anyone who has a good

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Sound setup

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Thank you, ooh cookie

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It's not as scary visually

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
As much as it is audibly

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
The visuals are great

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
They're just not as scary as the

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
EA's, as EA's been telling all of us

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Man can you believe the news this week

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
LittleBigPlanet gets delayed, Ghostbusters gets

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Picked back up and Obama's appearing in video games

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Didn't a caller bring that up a few weeks ago

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Oh and before I forget

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Ballhair says hi

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
He's got a last name now and he's doing well

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
He's got a guild and we're at guild level 14

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
At this moment

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
And we're talking keeps

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
And we're taking keeps

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Is it Ballhair Jenkins? Oh wait no

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Ballhair was a Warhammer character right?

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Yeah I'm looking

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Ballhair Trimmer

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
The Dawnbringer

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
Nice

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Ballhair Trimmer

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
That's lovely

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
And Ballhair got a guild

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Congratulations

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
That's it for email?

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
We have one from

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Entertainment

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Less email, more cookie? Oh yes

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
One more email

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
I mean this is actually in response

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
But we were cc'd on this so I'm gonna read it

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Alright

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
I brought, this is from Entertainment

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
I bought LittleBigPlanet

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
On Friday

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
And found out about the recall right before I sent this message

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
What the expletive deleted

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
For Bobby fuck for OLR should I do?

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
Should I contact Sony

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Wait for a patch or keep the game as

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
A collector's item and buy another copy?

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Thank you for your time

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Entertainment

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Yes that's an awesome idea, let's call Sony

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
And tell them not only did you break street on the game

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
He didn't break street, the person that sold it

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
Broke street

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
Keep it

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
And then buy another one

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Keep it, collector's item, maybe the serial number or something will be different

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Do not open it

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
Yeah well he probably already did because he didn't know about the

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
Change

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Just hang on to it, Sony's gonna patch it out

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Anyway so you're not gonna really have a choice

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Cause they're doing both but

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
The serial number on that box will make

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
It's gonna be like those pennies that have

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
Like the misprint on the back

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
You know those type of things, that's what it's gonna be

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
If you wanna play your copy

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
That's been unedited then

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Just come in from the internet

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Yeah entertainment's in chat right now

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It says he already opened it cause how would he know

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
That it was gonna be recalled so

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Can't say I blame you there

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
Alright let's get back, if that's it for Mailbag

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
While we chow down on cookies

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Loki the cookie hater

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
Here's one more thing

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Ow I hit myself in the face with the microphone

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Was that the thing?

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
You know what Rob

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
One thing that I

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Every so often will get an email on

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
And I'm meant to plug it during my classic game

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Of the week

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
Was a review done by

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Sauce

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Oh yes I was reading about this on Twitter

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
And I am getting the link now

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Cause if you go to Twitter.com

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
Slash Mar and Marvel there is a link to it

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
And her review of

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
The week is Actraiser

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
For classic game review

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
I know isn't it great

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
We just had an exclamation of

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
I love Actraiser

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So go look at it I'm linking it in the chatroom

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
And I'll link it on our Twitter

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Irene's god name in Actraiser

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Is Poop

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Oh Actraiser I love Actraiser

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
How funny that's what I named Link

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
In Legend of Zelda was Poop

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Wow copycat

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
I named him GGG cause I was lazy

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
Nice

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
I named him Zelda so I could get the extra

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
No I'm kidding

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Back to news cookie hater

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
Okay

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Well there is some controversy

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Around another game Saints Row 2

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Apparently New York

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Police unions condemn Saints Row 2

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
Because well you kill policemen

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
In the game

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
And according to them

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
New York's powerful police unions say that

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
A violent video

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
Or a violent new video game called Saints Row 2

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Is an abomination

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
In the game the players control a gang member

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Who can steal do drugs

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Kill as many characters as possible

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Including police officers

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Well you said it right there

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
They're killing everybody so you know what

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
I'm pissed off at Saints Row 2

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Because they're killing doctors

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
And prostitutes

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And college students

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
And cookies

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Do unions for college students coming out

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
You know

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
I'm a college student and I'm offended

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Or taxi drivers

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Or rednecks

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Do unions for students exist

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
They have the student union

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I guess that makes sense huh

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
The whole thing is just like

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
Okay this doesn't take place in New York

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
So

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
God yeah

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Because you know what before this game

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
No one's ever thought hey you know what

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
We can kill cops in it

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
This is the first game to ever do that

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
Thank you for pointing this out

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
This also I might add

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Comes from

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
WPEC

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
News 12 now

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
As you know

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
They're a CBS affiliate

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
And I would assume

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
The New York area

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
But I could be wrong

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Redertainment in chat says I'm mad because they can kill

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Redheaded dorks

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Me too I should be angered about that too

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Actually

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
So is the doctor he's waving his hand over there I'm pissed too

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Yeah I don't even know where the hell this

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Takes place it's somewhere on the east coast

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
That this um

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Actual uh newscast is from

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
To which the legend of Zaku

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Promptly follows up and says yay I didn't know

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
You can kill gingers in the game

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
Like it's incentive to buy it now

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Oh gingers

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Alright

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Oh North Carolina

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Not even close

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Rama in chat says news channel 12 is a local

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Cable news network

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I don't know

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Alright well look um

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
This kind of just dumbass-edness

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Always brings on our FUs of the week

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
And especially since Saints Row

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Is a game that Loki loves and adores

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
How dare the police department condemn it

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:36.000
You can condemn it all they want

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Dark Sakura FUs of the week

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
The election season

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
All of it

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
And um

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Sarah Palin for thinking she's funny

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Loki

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Um

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
God I had something early

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
That I was mad at about

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
But I don't remember so

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
FU to news 12

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Because they have

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Looks like a

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Cast of douchebags that run this thing

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
They're all kind of ugly in weird ways

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Um

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
My FU of the week goes to still not having

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Like a solid date for my surgery

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Like I think I know when it's gonna be

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
But because some people haven't gotten to my

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Paperwork I only kind of know that it's

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Probably gonna be not

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
This coming week but the next week

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
So there you go

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Uh fart princess do you have any FUs of the week?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
The doctor? Somebody?

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I'm the doctor

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
And I'm mad

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
At poop

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
I'm the doctor

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Thank you doctor

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
The parent has one

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
How about the real doctor?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
My FUs is all the

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
Crazy yes on 8 signs

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
In Amador County

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
No you don't even know

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
It's like a gauntlet you go through town and there's about

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
70,000 of them

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
I already went off on Prop 8 last week

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
So fuck you to everyone in Amador

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
County who's gonna vote yes on 8

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Protect my rights bitch

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
If it makes you feel better

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I already voted and I voted no

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Absentee

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
Fart princess do you have any real

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
FUs?

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
FU to poop

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Alright

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
The ferret has one

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Oh ferret yes ferret would like me to FU

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Thank you very much

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I agree with you ferret

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
The ferret is saying to vote no on 8 as well

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Exactly

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Alright let's get back into some gaming news

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Sellers of Catan you guys know this game from

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Xbox Live or you probably know the original board game

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Hello

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
It kind of broke

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I found some walls when it came to Xbox Live arcade

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Because it was the first, besides Uno

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
It was the first really in depth board game

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
To really come out

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
On Xbox Live and that was really cool

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
But now it's not gonna stop there

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Sellers of Catan is coming out on the Nintendo DS

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
As well

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
It's actually gonna be a version of a mobile

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Game that's coming out called

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Catan the first island but of course

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
The graphics and such will be much better than they are on mobile

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So there's even a trailer up for it

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
On YouTube and you can take a look at it

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
And of course if you don't know what Catan is

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It's a game about bartering and trading

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
It's kind of like Civilization and board game format

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Except it made no sense to me

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
When I tried to learn how to play it

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
But I have a limited attention span for these types of things

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
What? I was more of a Carcassonne fan

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
What? Exactly

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
Who? Yep, you got it

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
What about carcasses? No

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Just no

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
How about games we do understand

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
Games where we just shoot and kill things

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Well kind of sorta

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
We have ratings

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
For the ESRB for stuff to come out on Virtual Console

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
And that would be

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Metal Slug 2

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
You can ride a camel in it

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
And the camel has a gatling gun

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Watch out, they spit

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
This one spits bullets

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Out of his hip

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Awesome

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Best camel ever

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
The other game is

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
A boy and his blob

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Trouble on Blobolonia

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
This is a DS version that was supposed to come out

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Did it ever come out?

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I don't think it ever did actually

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
It never came out

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Maybe the publisher went under, I don't know

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Get those jelly beans ready

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
Jelly beans

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
That's it

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Nobody gets that

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
You have to feed him jelly beans

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
No, I get that

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
It may actually have come out

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
I'm looking, there's a little review

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Here

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
It's actually come out

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
I'm looking here to see

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Oh no, it was cancelled

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
They had a box art and everything

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
And the release was cancelled

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
That's sadness

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
It didn't really peak my interest anyway

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
When we went to E3 and we saw it

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Rob, that makes my heart hurt

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
I know, it makes my heart hurt too

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
But we have a new one coming out

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Well the Virtual Console one

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Yeah, that's ok

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
It's the same damn game I've already played

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
I should just play the Nintendo

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Before we get back into some news

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I want to take a little detour because you guys got to the show late

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
You didn't get to talk about your gaming week

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
But you were telling me, Fart Princess

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
That there was a game you wanted to talk about

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Yes, there is

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I've been playing Hello Kitty online

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
For real, this isn't a joke

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
No, why would it be a joke?

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
There really is a Hello Kitty online?

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Yeah, didn't you see that person

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Post a link in your livestream?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Yes, but it's for the sake of the radio

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Rob, I'd appreciate it if you stopped farting

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
That's really rude

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Shut up and tell us about the game

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
No, I haven't checked it out

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Tell us about the game, what do you do in the game?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
Do you get to play as Hello Kitty?

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
No, you play as a boy or a girl character

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Do you have a mouth?

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I don't remember

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
I think you do

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I'm pretty sure you have a butt too

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
You can like

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
You're interrupting me, Rob

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
What?

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
What's so funny?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Nothing, go ahead

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Rob!

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Jeez, Rob, close your eyes

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
Knock it off, gaming news

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
I'm not going to let you talk about Hello Kitty

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
If you don't get to it

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
Hello farty

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
You level the traditional sense of an MMO

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
But there's no

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
You can't kill anything in the game

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
Unless you fart on it

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
The way you level in the game is

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Fatal flatulence

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Yes, that's totally it

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
You forage for stuff

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Like you gather plants and stuff

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
And then when you eat it, you go

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:54.000
That was a long fart

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Wow, that took all of my breath

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
My butt breath

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Your butt breath?

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
You're derailing the show, Rob

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
And you fight enemies too

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
But you don't kill them

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Are they giant enemy crabs?

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
They are, they're crabs

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Or do they just give you crabs?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
They might do that too

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
They might also give you gas

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Like

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Stop it, Rob

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
New from Squeenix, fatal flatulence

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
And that's basically

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:34.000
The gist of the game

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Look what you did, Rob

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
You should be ashamed of yourself

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
Now I'm thinking there actually should be a game

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Called Hello Farty

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Alright, stop it

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
People in the chatroom are complaining about their speakers

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.000
They should be complaining about the smell

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Can we get on to some gaming?

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I thought I would actually learn something about Hello Kitty

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I told you about it, all about it

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
You just farted a lot

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
You didn't even listen

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
SSJ100Matt says Rob's gonna write a hate letter to the show

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
That is true

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Uh, Loki

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I'm gonna make sure that before the podcast goes out

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
We strip out all the fart noises

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Then it wouldn't make sense

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
We're gonna patch it for day one release

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
So that anybody who does obtain the podcast early

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Does not get to hear the fart noises

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I'm gonna be replaced with birds chirping

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Aw, that'd be great

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Then we'd be giggling at birds chirping

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Alright

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I'm gonna be Hello Birdy

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
How about Rock Band?

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
How about Rock Band?

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Rock Band 2 is coming to the Wii in November

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
And with it

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
All the features that you love in Rock Band 2

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
On the other platforms

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Including, you will be able to download

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
The Rock Band 1 tracks

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
As well when they become available

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
And also

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
That the Guitar Hero 3 controller

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Will work with the game now

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
So that's kinda cool

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
And of course any additional download content will be available

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
On the network as well

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
And you can store them on your SD memory card

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
So that's kinda cool

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Sweet

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I played a demo of this and dare I say

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
I pwned at the drums

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Good

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Because I suck at drums

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
So we should start a band

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Wait, so you have Rock Band on the Wii?

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
No, but they had a demo

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Oh, I see

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
So you haven't really played Rock Band

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
You've been in a Best Buy band

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Alright

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Wii Music

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
The other type of band game

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Wii Music is doing very well in Japan

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
I know it's been getting a little bit of negative press around the fan

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Well actually

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Here's what I'm curious about

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Doctor

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
You're a big giant Nintendo whore

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Like you love everything Nintendo

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Now we're kinda not feeling Wii Music

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Nope

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
By Wii

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
He means himself

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
And Loki

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I would like to point out that Dark Saga has said she wouldn't pay for it

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
No

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I might have paid for it if I didn't know I was getting one for free

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Anyhow

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
The Doctor

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Are you interested in Wii Music at all?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Why not?

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I am the biggest Nintendo

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
And I'm just like

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I'm kinda bored with these completely novelty games

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Like

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
You know, there's so many cool things

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
That they could do on the Wii

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
And they're just not

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
And I'm just like, okay, here's another game

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Where you get to wave the Wii mode around

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
And I'm just like, ugh

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Alright, well guess what

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
The country of Japan disagrees with us

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
And agrees with Dark Sakura

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
According to Famitsu

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I'm sorry, according to Famitsu's publisher

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
50,000 units were sold on

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
Day 1 in Japan

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
So the game is doing huge in Japan

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
And sold a lot

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Like it or not, it looks like this game

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Will probably have similar success

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Over here, but again, you know

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
To recap what we've kinda said before on this program

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
At least myself

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
If it gets young kids interested in music

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
It's not a bad thing, but for this old kid

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
No thank you, I'll pass

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
So

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
More gaming news

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Just one more

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line pretty soon

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
At 877-GAME-OLR

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Nice plug

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Nice plug

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Well, this goes back to a series

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
That was one of the first ones I ever played

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
When the Playstation first came out

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
In fact, it was one of the

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
First games that anyone played

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
On the Playstation when it first came out

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
It was Toshinden

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I love Toshinden

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Actually, the third one was great

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Because it was awful

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
It had the butt monkey in it and the guy with the chainsaw

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Named David

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
He did the butt monkey dance!

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Okay

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
No, he was like a baboon and he had a big red butt

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
And whenever he went

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
He would do this little clappy dance

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
With his butt

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
So anyway

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
There's actually news

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
In Famitsu that says

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Takara Tomy is going to be bringing

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Out the Toshinden series on the Wii

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
So maybe they'll actually

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Make it better?

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Who knows?

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
You get to spank the monkey's butt

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
But it looks kinda cool

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
I love Toshinden

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
You know, I guess

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Retro games making a comeback is nothing new

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
In this current gen world

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
I need to go

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
That just means I need to go find that issue of Famitsu

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Wario Land is pretty good for that

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Wario Land?

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Have you bought the new Wario Land?

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
It's very good

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
It's this great 2D animation

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
It's good

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Anyhow, sorry

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Let's talk about PC games a little bit quickly

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
No! Boycott!

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Well, there's no boycott

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
Yet

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
But Far Cry 2 is going to be bundled with

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Everybody's favorite sport

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Digital Rights Management

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
You can get Securom

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Technology

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Along with Far Cry 2

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
It will be

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
It will have these restrictions

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
The purchasers will have up to

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Five activations on three

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Separate PCs

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Uninstalling Far Cry 2

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Refunds in activation

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
This process is known as a revoke

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
As long as you properly uninstall the game

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
You'll be able to reinstall it an unlimited

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Number of times on three machines

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
A computer

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Can be upgraded an unlimited

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Number of times using revoke

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Ubisoft is

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Willing to provide additional activations

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
If necessary

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Ubisoft is committed to a long term support

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Of their games

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
And you'll always be able to play Far Cry 2

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
So apparently

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
This is what they're going to start doing from now on

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
I don't understand why they're still using Securom

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Technology since it can be so easily broken

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
And people just hate it in general

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
But do people as a whole

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Do they really seem to care?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Well, not according to EA who says that

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
With a small percentage

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
They're claiming that 99.8%

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Of consumers will never notice

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
The digital rights management

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
That's in the game

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Which I think is kind of sad that they don't notice

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
That it's in there because it could potentially

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Harm their system

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Especially when it comes to

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
CD burning software and stuff like that

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Whatever that it interrupts

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
And the fact that these people are unaware

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
That this game is actually causing this problem

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
That they will go take it in

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
And cost them money

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
But either way they say we can eliminate piracy

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
By essentially blocking the online service

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
From the pirate

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
It's called the future of

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Digital rights management

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Well, that's nice, you know, but some people don't really care about

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
The online portion of your game

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
And they will still pirate it

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
In fact, I think there was quite a few copies

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Of Spore that were pirated

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And to be honest, all they're losing

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Is the online portion of it

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
And if you really don't give a crap about seeing other people's penis monsters

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Then you can still play the game

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
LegendofZaco in chat says

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Gotta love EA pulling voodoo stats out of their asses

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Is that what this is?

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
I think so

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I mean

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I don't know, we don't know for sure how many people actually know about it

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
So we have to take their word for it

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
It's not necessarily that they're pulling it out of their ass

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
It's just the way they report the numbers

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
That's just politics

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Anyhow

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
It's like they think that people that are complaining about it are gonna go

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Oh, well, okay

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
So not that many people are complaining about it

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I guess I'll just stop complaining

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
You're right

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
No, that's not gonna happen

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Anyhow, one more story

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Then we're gonna get to some calls on the skype line

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And this one has to do with Ghostbusters

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
You know that game that we hear things about it

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Then it goes away, then it comes back

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Well, people are talking about Ghostbusters again

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
And it's all thanks to Dan Aykroyd

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Which of course is one of the actors in the original movie

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
And he was on a Dallas radio station this week

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
105.3

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
And he talked to the radio station

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
And actually confirmed that the Ghostbusters title

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
Has been picked up by Atari to be published

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
And said that the game

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Will be less than a year away from being released

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
So apparently

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
It is confirmed that Atari

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Has picked up the game

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
And Atari will be publishing the game

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Don't expect to see it tomorrow, though

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
They're saying the polish and cleaning up the game

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Could take as long as May of 2009

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
So you'll see this game

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
At some point next year

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
That could also mean Christmas 2009

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
That's crazier than a

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Vaporous full torso apparition

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Thanks

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
That makes me giddy

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
But we're talking about piss in the chat room

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
Um, okay

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Exactly

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Chat.orangelandsradio.com for an experience

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
That really can't be described

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Oh my

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
It's talking about scientific fact

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
That urine is a sterile solution

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Do you ever talk games in the

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Area of medical curiosity?

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Do you pee on your video games?

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Someone brought up peeing in the shower

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
And I was

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
I was making fun and doing the girly thing

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Who wants to stand in their own piss?

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
1877 game O.L.R.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Now is a great time

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Now is an excellent time

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
I hope Sigourney Weaver is in the game

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Yes, the acidic vampire

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Is a very good point

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
And of course Dark Tetsuya brings up

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
O.L.R. is like pissing in an ocean of piss

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Will the game be nearly as cool

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
As the Commodore 64 version

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
Of Ghostbusters? That's what I want to know

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Dude, you are red

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I love that the first

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
Half of the show was really smart

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
And intelligent and the second half has been nothing

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
But piss and fart

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
God

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
This show is just so strange

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Maybe our caller

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Let's go to the phones

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
We have a caller, let's see if they're gonna

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
What IQ level they're at tonight

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
This is Ranma, who is just as immature

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
As everybody else in the studio

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Oh, hooray

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Ranma, what's on your mind?

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Not much, Rob

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
I have a bone to pick with you

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Oh god, what did I do now?

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
I'm offended by how you pronounce people's names

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Yeah, you know, I find it pretty offensive too

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
That I can't learn to fucking read

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Especially with all the languages

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
In the world that people derive their names from

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
I'm very offended that I just don't, like, fucking know

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Because, you know, sometimes

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
You read things one way in one language

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
And they read another way in another

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
And I'm offended by my lack of edumacation

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
You know we love you, Rob, right?

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Yeah, I know

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Are you just trying to be a smartass about something?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Yes

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
And what?

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
But the whole little big plan is just

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
It's ridiculous, that's all it is

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
And why do you say ridiculous?

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Everybody gets offended over something

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
And the problem is, not enough people in this world

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Is open-minded to realize it's nothing to be

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
It's nothing that serious

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
That's all it is

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
I'm just saying, in a way, how Muslims are kind of being

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Like, subjugated

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
About what's going on in the news and the media

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
So, of course, something like this they're gonna pick up on

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
And they're gonna lose their minds about it

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Is that really Sony's fault, though?

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Because, you know, kind of like I was saying before

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
If Sony doesn't do anything about this

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
And then the mainstream media picks up on this

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
I mean, it's gonna do a lot of damage

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Whereas Sony's trying to put out a fire here

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Before it gets too big

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
But why should they?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
I mean, it's a normal song, big deal

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Sadly, it's the world we live in

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
And I'm not saying it's alright

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
It's just, you know, it's what it is

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Yeah

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
What else is on your mind?

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Have you been to any cons lately you wanna talk about?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Yes, I just got back from a convention

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
About six, seven hours ago

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
You are the con king

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
What con did you go to this time?

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
I'm a con whore

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I went to Zenkai Con

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Where is Zenkai Con?

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Valley Forge Convention Center

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
It's where Classic Gaming Expo was a few years ago

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Ah, okay, so how was it?

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Was there a lot of gaming stuff to be seen there?

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
Or was it mostly anime, or what?

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
It was a mix of A and B

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
But it wasn't that many video gaming cosplay

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
But I will say the game room was nice

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
It was...

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
It was great

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
Did you get to play anything in the game room you hadn't played before?

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:11.000
I pretty much, I played the new Bleach game for the Wii

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
That one I had not played yet

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
What'd you think?

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
I thought it was pretty good

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I liked the fact that to attack

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
You actually shake the Wii mode to attack

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
You attack in the game

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Which is something I've never seen in a Wii game before, really

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Yeah

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
Never heard of that one

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Well that's cool

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
What do you think about anime games

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
On gaming consoles in general

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
Because a lot of us kind of write them off as crap

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Just like a lot of movie and TV show game translations

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.000
Are there anime games out there that seem to transcend this

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Or are they just crap too?

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
It depends

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
I mean, when I got into Ranma 1.5

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
And then the video game came out

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I thought the game was good

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
But looking back, I kind of hard battled

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
The only one that came to the states

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
That was a good one

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
It didn't really follow the story line though

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
It was good

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Nowadays with a lot of anime games

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
They're actually taking the story lines

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
And putting it into the game

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
If you notice how all the Dragon Ball Z games are

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Even though they're rehashes

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
But they're actually taking the story line

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
And following along with this

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Why there's like five different sequels to a game

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
What system was this?

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
I've never played the Ranma

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
I played a Ranma game on Super Nintendo

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
That's the one

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
There's also one on PC Engine

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
There's an RPG on PC Engine

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
Which I've played a little bit of

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
It's kind of hard

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
On Playstation there was a Ranma 1.5 Battle Renaissance

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Which I've got and it's kind of fun

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Rice Princess is like Ranma

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Because if you pour water on her she goes

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Shut up

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Did you play Battle Renaissance?

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Yeah, I played it

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
The engine was a little bit loose

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
But it was still fun

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
I love actually kicking people's butts

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
There you go

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Yeah

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Alright, well any other comments before we get some more calls?

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
One thing

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
You'll probably get a real kick out of

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I'll have pictures uploaded soon

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
We had a samba de amigo dance party

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
At the convention Friday night

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Oh dear good lord

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
How exactly does one go to a samba de amigo dance party?

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
You get

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
You show up

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
You grab the maracas

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
You start playing

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
You start freestyling and dancing

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
First few minutes no one really showed up

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
But as the music started blasting

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
We had a line going all the way down

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
People just wanted to get up and have fun with it

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
We were giving out little maracas

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
As prizes

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
We had sombrero hats giving them out to

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
Where we could do the best funky dance ever

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
You should put that on YouTube

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Promptly

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
If it's not up now it should be up by later this week

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
And I will find images and links

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
And I'll send it to you guys

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Alright Rama we gotta let you go

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
But have a good one buddy

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
You too enjoy

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
If you want to give us a call

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Hello OrangeLoungeRadio

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Is he who seeks to replace

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
The train wreck of the general masses

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
With the train wreck of his own choosing

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Hello

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
R

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Introduce yourself

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Bob Adrian of Hydra

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I know who you are

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
But you have to introduce yourself to the listeners

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
I'm Jason

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Alright what's on your mind

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
Since we ever so briefly touched on it

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
I thought I'd add in a couple little comments

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Since we didn't really go onto it

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Two side notes before I do that

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
Jump Superstars while it wasn't really

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
An anime game to the same extent

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
You were talking about

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
A good game, it was a very good fighter

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Not one that I've really

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I'm not much of a fighter person but I had a lot of fun with Jump Superstars

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I played that a little bit and it is fun

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
And the other side note

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Has anybody even played

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
The DR Universe series?

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Yeah I have the first game

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
I don't have the second game

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I have the first game and although quest mode

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Was awful awful awful I like the song list

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
And steps of what there was

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
When I bought my

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
Xbox I have quite a few

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Other games as well but my initial reasoning

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
For wanting to buy it was pretty much purely

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
The UltraMix series

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
And they were great

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
And then E3 came around with the

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Universe redone banners from

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Boring hell

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
And I've just never cared to play the

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
Universe series at all

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Yeah but past the banners it's kind of nice to have the game

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
In high def and wide screen

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
It's a neat little change for the game

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
It probably is I don't doubt that

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
But I mean UltraMix was never

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
The most visually appealing game in the first place

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
I don't think anybody is going to deny that

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
It played really well past the first one

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
But it never looked that way

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
Universe 2 was kind of just like Universe 1 from what I

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Understood but Universe 3 is supposed

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
To be a lot different so I'm

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
I'm curious I'll check it out probably

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Funny all this from

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
The Bimani series

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
The Bimani show that was and

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Is only a footnote now

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Yeah well you know and a lot of shows

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Still don't even talk about it at all and a lot of shows

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Would just say oh it's another

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
DDR game they're all the same and to some

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Extent they're right but there are

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
There are definitely those differences out there

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Well now it's time to talk about it

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
And in the process talk about me

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Kind of, not really

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
Funny story, have you guys heard of the

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
There's a sim file that DMSura

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
Made quite a while ago called DeltaMax

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
Ever heard of it?

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Yes, vaguely, I know what DMSura

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Is but I vaguely know

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
The gimmick so to say about it

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Isn't it that you hit all four notes

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
At once or something?

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
That's an old gimmick but that's okay

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
I don't

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
The gimmick is that it's a

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
DMSura remix of the Max series

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
And it starts at I think

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
130 beats per minute

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
And ends at 573

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Is that the one, oh okay

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Is it the one that rolls backwards because I remember that being

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
A gimmick too, alright

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
Okay so it starts

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
It's all progression, 130 to 573

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
It's kind of like a

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
BPM per measure

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
But it speeds up

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
The speed is not statically

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Increasing, it is very variable, it goes with the

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Tune, it's actually really cool

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
There's a step mania cabinet

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
That a friend of ours built into

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
The DDR machine down in Colorado Springs

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
That there's a tournament going on

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
At next month, not that anybody

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Hey if you're in the Colorado area come down to Mr. Big's

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Next weekend rather, not next month

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
There's going to be a lot of cool people there

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Ding, that's my plug for the day

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
So he has a step mania

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Cab with all of the official DDR songs

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
A ton of sim files, delta max

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Being one of them and a couple of other little

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Bonus extras like in the groove

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
I was very very

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Disappointed to hear that

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Delta max in universe

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
3 isn't going to have

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
The sim created background

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
Video, because if it

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
Did I could have claimed a

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
My own little piece of assistance

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Property in a DDR official game

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Why did you do

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Something with this?

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
There's a person nicknamed

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Tora that I

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Believe he actually did all of the background work

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
Basically, I don't even remember what the

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Image background is, but he

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Created a series of text of all of the beats per minute

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
All the BPM numbers

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
And they have this

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Shaky fluid effect

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
And he put the

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Videos for that together amazingly

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
But what I did was I wrote out a quick

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Little script to actually put

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
In the changes that he wanted to

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
And again it goes up

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
It was a pain in the ass

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Too

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Just the changes in the videos

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
The fact that it's not just linear straight up

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
Calculating which measurement and time that it happens on

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I barely even remember

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
That was like 3 years ago

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
But it was a very awesome video

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
It was very simple

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
But Konami came in and changed it all?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
They want to do their own thing probably

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
It'll be flowers and sparkles

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
No it's

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Universe, it'll be spaceships

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
And Uranus

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
On that note

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
It'll be a lot of

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Delta triangles flying over the screen

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
Because you know, Delta and

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Triangles

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Oh my god, trigonometry, no!

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Well sorry to hear you just missed your chance

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
For remote video game stardom

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Hey you have OLR stardom

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Any other things you want to say

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Real quick before we move on?

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
No I think that was my excuse

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
For calling in tonight

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Well Jason take care, thanks for your comments

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Alright guys

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
We'll take one more call

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
1877 game OLR, username on skype

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
And then we have some last minute stories to do

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Before we get on out of here, hey live listeners

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
You'll want to stay tuned tonight

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Past the show, we have a little treat for you guys

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
We'll get into that in a little while

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Be sure to join us next week for episode 300

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Do you think though that they might have

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Lasted a lot of sales chance because a lot of the

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
People that would have been interested in this are just going to go to

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
The fan translation? I guess let me rephrase

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
How many of the people that end up playing the fan

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Translation do you think would turn around and buy something official

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
From Nintendo?

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
That's a good question

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
I myself would buy the official thing

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
If it were to come out

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
In fact the translators encourage

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Buying the official

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
Merchandise and stuff

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
But as far as the

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Nintendo side of things I just hope that

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
If they

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
Decide to do something like sue the translators

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Or something like that

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
It means that

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
That they're working on an official translation

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
That they're not just going to leave it

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Dead. You know I think a lot of people

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
Are like you and you know if they're real true

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Fans of the series they would buy an official

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
Translation anyway but do you think there's some people

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
That would feel so slighted that once they play

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Through the translation they're just going to be like

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Yeah screw the real one

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Yeah that's a good

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
That's a good point

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
Kind of like when I

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Like I used to download

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
A lot of like money songs

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
They're like buying it and stuff

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
Nah screw buying the real thing

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
I'll just keep it

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Especially with the import stuff

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Well I guess we will see

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I'm very curious to see if it does

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Catch the attention of people in Nintendo

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
I'm waiting for the cease and desist myself

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
Yeah

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Sky you're in Milpitas Golf Land

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Damn we need to come down to Sunnyville Golf Land again

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Um you know I know I knew

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
I was in the area just it worked out

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
So that we were at Milpitas and I didn't make it over there

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
But I'll get to Sunnyville at some point

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
I'm sure

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Yeah maybe the NorCal division of the

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
All-Armor can meet up there

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
We'll see we'll see you know um

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
With the surgery coming up and everything it won't be anytime soon

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
But who knows maybe by the end of the year

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
Yeah I was saying

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
We're going to Svega Lailies

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
For Popin' 16

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Oh hey I like popin' music

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
It's certainly better than beatin' groovy

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
Yeah I've gotten back into it recently

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Yeah

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
I might get a job

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
Like I'm possibly getting a job

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Where in the winter I might use the money to get a desktop arcade

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
So I can play the real thing at home

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
Instead of frickin' 9 key 2DX

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
Good times good times

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
I wish I

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I wish I had that kind of disposable income

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
But then again I'm looking at my new iPhone

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
When I'm saying that

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
We all have priorities

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Alright GS6 here we gotta let you go

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
But have a good one buddy

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Alright bye bye

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
You know Dekeman in chat has a good point

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
He says they've had two years to give them a cease and desist

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Sometimes it's not until you start getting noticed

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Like hello in the groove

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Remember that?

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Nobody cared until they tried to put out a home version of the game

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Alright anyway

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Last minute stories

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
DarkSoccer anything for us tonight for last minute stories?

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Yeah

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
What?

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Fire

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Loki you always have something for last minute stories

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Yeah a few more things real quick

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
We know that Guitar Hero they're talking about

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Making god knows how many games next year

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Well there's yet another one that's been

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Discovered

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
A trademark has recently been placed

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
For the title

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Guitar Hero Modern Hits

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:43.000
And no word on exactly what that is

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Of course the term hit is relative

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Exactly

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Who knows

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
If I were to take a guess I think it's another DS version

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
It sounds like a DS version to me

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
That's a good point

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
It's pretty vague

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Alright

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Xbox Live Marketplace

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
As an Xbox original

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Starting well actually

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
This Monday October 20th

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
So you'll be able to download the full game

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
For $15 or

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
1200 Microsoft Points

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
So that's pretty cool

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
Also

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Fable 2

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
You should definitely go to

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Microsoft's website

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
They have a special website made for Fable 2

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Xbox.com

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
I believe you just go to the Fable 2 page

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
They have a little game that you can play

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
Including Chicken Kickin

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
You can actually win prizes

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
For your in-game character

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
So you can win gold and different prizes

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
In Fable 2

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Playing this Flash game

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Which I think is pretty cool and hasn't been done before

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
So hopefully you see some more

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Website integration with different games

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
If it's not another week

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
With another movie announcement

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Based on a game

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Well Grant Morrison is now

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Doing the Area 51 game

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
You know what though? Max Payne was number one

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
At the box office this week beating that very

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Hyped W movie

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
So there's money to be made

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Yeah

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
So interesting

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Area 51 the movie

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Hopefully it's cheesy and motion captured

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Then there's

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Going to be some new download content for Mega Man

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
9 coming soon including a brand new

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Bonus level with a bonus boss

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Fake Man

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
And you'll be able to purchase

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
That for 100 Wii

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
Points

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Will it not be impossibly hard?

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Probably not

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
But it's a brand new special stage

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
Oh my god I can't play that game

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
And lastly to kind of talk a little bit about

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Another game that

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
We'll be seeing a little bit more pretty soon

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Little Big Planet

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
They actually have some more videos from the beta

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Someone has actually recreated some of the levels

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
From Mirror's Edge

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
In this game

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
So you can actually play some of the Mirror's Edge

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
In the beta and of course the full game

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
When it comes out because all those levels are

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Being transferred over which is pretty

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
Freaking awesome

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
And that's it

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
Well that's going to do it for tonight's episode of

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Orange Lounge Radio but before we

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Finish the show tonight we got to go around and get everybody's

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
Final thought

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
Fart Princess thank you for coming to the show

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
When you did and everything

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Do you have a final thought for us?

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Even though you were late

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Vote no on Poop 8

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
The Doctor

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Do you have any final thoughts?

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Don't vote for McCain

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
He's crazy

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
We're getting a little political tonight

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Loki do you have

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
A final thought?

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
My costume

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Is freaking awesome

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
And you may see it next week

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Is it Tingle?

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
It's a video game character

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Okay

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
My final thought is

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Mentos

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Fresh and full of life

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Darsakha your final thought?

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
I fucking love Ichiban Khan

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Ichiban Khan

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
USA.com

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I shop there every time I'm in San Francisco

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Sounds good

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Alright next week episode

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
300 of Orange Lounge Radio

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
What guests and surprises await the crew?

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
What messages

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Will you guys leave for us on our skype line

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
When we're not live?

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
Will it potentially be a fuck show?

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Who knows all that to be determined

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
In one weeks time

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Come back for episode 300

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio next week

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Hey if you enjoyed what you heard tonight

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Tell two friends about the show

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
That's how we spread the word

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
And if you don't have any friends

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Just kidding even if you do

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Buy them

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
On the store and I'll post the link in chat

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
And leave us a nice 5 star review

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
Yes every little bit helps

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
The more listeners we have the better

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Because it's not about awards

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
It's about listeners

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
About you guys that show up every week

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
So thank you guys so much

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
