been here live in studio with us um everybody who's ever joined us in chat room and of course you know a lot of the people who've helped make this happen we'll talk more about that later on we'll save that for the end the thank yous and the sniffles um all right well hey you know what otherwise as far as what we have planned tonight it's just another show nothing special lots of gaming news to talk about tonight but we have to start it off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week dark soccer how was your gaming week um it was a big fable i didn't do much playing in it however dan did and he's been throwing fire at people and showing off his trophy which i think is entirely and flipping everyone off which is just the best ever and his guy looks kind of like a gorilla um with a red coat and it's kind of cool and i've decided that when i play fable um play fable 2 i'm going to make the biggest raging lesbian ever you're still a chicken chaser you chase chickens i'm okay and but he had to do the thing where he had to wear dreads and mutton chops and the dress and they said it was the wrong dress and that was kind of funny and i've been playing ragnarok of course and um i got my ds finally however it's not here it's at home but dan got me a black ds much very similar to melton's black ds you have a blue one that melton has like a little star wars thing on it's pretty neat little uh i could i could totally bust out my uh miyamoto stickers though from e3 a few years ago but um but yes i have a nice one i babysat yesterday too really yes did you play any games with the baby we went to the jungle gym and played let's splash all of the water in the fountain and um baby's gonna slide down whether you're at the bottom to catch him or not and let's see how many times catch the baby and it was also let's let's see how often julian will run back to the swings and beg to be in it only to not do anything but look at the other children i think the orange lounge radio official game should be something a lot like wario wear where all the little micro games are like little in-jokes from the show and there should be one where dark sakura is there with a big net and it says catch and baby stars and there's babies falling from the sky i do have to say i do have to say and this he's such a good kid that he's the reason why i'm no longer afraid of most babies in small numbers namely one do you want to eat them like shane no shane has um subscriptions we we heart you shane you've got subscriptions he's not listening he hates this show all right well he hates everything that he likes anything else high school musical oh lord my god all right uh you're cut off all right no no loki sack boy sack loki how was your gaming week um i didn't play that much this week mainly i played um little big planet i love that game um it's actually i'm now in the japanese level which is pretty cool so i'm dressed up like a ninja and i've got uh i'm a ninja pirate because i'm wearing the ninja the ninja uh and i've got the uh pirate outfit and um i'm carrying a frying pan so that's awesome and how is everyone's a little bit racist the game um pretty good but it apparently uh it's not going to be as racist soon so um no i mean come on it was we were looking at it on justin tv last week after the show it's like a little present for our live listeners and we saw like a bunch of like you know that the africa level is all the africa stereotypes and you know the south america level is all those stereotypes you know and the america level was hot dogs and cheeseburgers just i know actually it was it was race cars and jazz there you go wait wait wait if you go to maticas car will they shut down everything i don't know um now i'm glad though when they did fix the song um that they didn't actually remove it from the game they just edited out the lyrics which is awesome because the song itself was awesome and to be honest if the lyrics aren't in there i'm not sad so all right whatever but um other than that i've been playing saints row 2 multiplayer because that's fun still glitchy in fact we found a new trick now apparently if you throw satchel charges on people because you can actually stick them to other players if i like for example stick multiple satchel charges on when they respawn they still have the ones that haven't exploded yet so you can detonate them again and kill them again which is uh kind of a boo-boo there but um and then oddly enough i've been watching someone play fable can you guess who is playing fable 2 my wife is playing fable 2 wait your wife the game hater is playing fable 2 yes she's playing fable 2 she here's how it happened she saw the commercial fort that they have now where the guy is playing with the little uh i forget what you call those things um and balls no not balls the little thing the fortune things that you open in your hand it looked like a little pac-man i don't remember they call those kids in elementary school play with them anyways so and each time he changes it it's a fortune kudi catcher thank you kudie catcher okay so he's playing with that and each time he changes it it changes his appearance and kind of looks evil and stuff like that and ellie's like what game is that that looks cool because she's really into the whole people becoming evil thing you know like darth vader she loved the whole like story of darth vader aren't you a little worried that your wife likes it when people become evil i don't know but anyways so she's like what game is that i'm I'm like, oh, Fable 2. I'm like, I've had that for a while now. Do you want to play it? She's like, she's all, yeah, set it up for me. So I set it up for her, kind of helped her walk through it. Now she's way further in the game than I am. But granted, I've only played the game for like less than an hour, so, you know. But she, she was like literally when I was leaving today to go finish my costume before I came over here. She was just like, she's okay, I gotta quit in like half an hour because I have to go to the gym. And she's just seriously contemplating not going to the gym to play the game. Nice. Yeah. Wow. Just getting to that point. Yeah. I know it brings back memories of Final Fantasy XI. I know, a proud gamer moment. Are you a proud gaming husband now? I, I don't think she's gonna, she's gonna get bored with it because she's not paying attention to any of the storyline or any of like what's supposed to go on. She's like, kill, kill, die, die, die, kill, kill, die, die, die. It keeps giving her like helpful hints like, you know, her life is low, you should go find an inn or some potion. She's like, I don't know where the hell the inn is. I'm like, go to one of the towns. She's like, I went to the towns, there's no inns there. I'm like, you need to look around to see if you can find it. Well, I don't know how to do that. Or like she still doesn't have, she hasn't quite figured out the right analog stick so she can't change the camera angle very well. Look for the building that says inn on it. I know, but she doesn't have patience for that stuff. I'm like, well, she's like, what am I supposed to be doing now? I'm like, well, what'd that guy say to you? I don't know, I wasn't listening to him. Stuff like that. Let's read some comments from chat. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com. By the way, I know we have a lot of people on Justin TV tonight because of a Loki being sack boy. I don't know what it is. If Justin TV highlighted us or something, but please keep in mind, we only read our regular chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com. That's not because we hate you guys, Justin TV, but it's because, well, it's partially that, but no, we have a real hard time reading two chat rooms at once. Cause we are trying to do a show here. So chat.orangelawnsradio.com. Redertainment in chat says the last time I skipped the gym to game was five years ago. I haven't been back to the gym since. There you go. All right. Anyhow, I'm assuming that's it for Loki's gaming week. So I'll talk about my gaming week. Um, I finally bought a PlayStation three after all. Why are you booing? At least there's good games on it. At least you didn't buy it just because, Oh, I want a PlayStation 3. Now there were finally games I wanted out. I want little big planet, even though I wasn't able to get it yesterday, contrary to popular rumor, but I have it all set up. I have a Blu-ray disc. At least I have Edward Scissorhands on Blu-ray cause that movie is awesome. You have to get an Amber before Christmas too. It looks good on Blu-ray. And I like to mention though that last week I was concerned that I may have to return my copy a little bit. It's my turn. Sorry. So I didn't have to thank God. So I get to keep the slightly offensive version. Awesome. All right. So yeah, I finally got, took the plunge and got a PlayStation three for SingStar ABBA as well, even though that's not out till December, but I did buy SingStar PlayStation three and a, you know, the game itself is kind of crappy compared to like Rob Band and other songs that you can sing it. But I will tell you the best thing about SingStar PlayStation three. Actually, there's a couple of good things about it. It's, it's a really good party game because it has the music videos in the back. It's a, it's a good game for non-gamers. If that makes sense. Like it's a good game for people to just pick up the mics and sing and have fun with it. And there are a lot of songs on the SingStar, even though I haven't heard of half of them. There's like 300 songs on that store, but I'll tell you the best part is that part. That's like YouTube that you can go in there and look at the community videos. Um, I don't have a webcam myself. Thank you very much. I don't want to put myself on there now. Don't worry about it, but you can go look at other people and there are some awesome videos on there. Like they have people dressed up in star Wars costumes, dancing to some of the songs, but I'll tell you that the cutest ones are people that have their kids singing the song. Like there's this little three-year-old girl singing a blink 182 dammit. And she's so cute doing it. She's like, she's so cute. And so that's the best part of the game is just going on like the YouTube type thing and looking at that. So I had fun with it. So, um, yeah, I don't know that it's not for everyone. Get it. If you have a lot of parties, but if you're a solo gamer, I don't think there's a lot here for you unless you like to sing to yourself. Um, otherwise I'm just holding out for a little big planet and I'll probably be going back to the three 60 in the meantime. However, I will say this, uh, PlayStation three has, I got to say that Blu-ray player is pretty awesome. Um, and it does upscale the old movies pretty good on DVD and the media server I thought was a lot easier to use the Microsoft's servers. I was really surprised that kind of surprised me. I was thinking that the three 60 media server would be a lot easier cause you know, hello windows, you know, Microsoft, no, the PlayStation three one was disgustingly simple. However, here's a word of advice for you folks. Don't run the media server and your internet connection at the same time. Cause it can't, your internet connection can't hold it on the PlayStation three. That's the one thing about it. So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week. Otherwise I haven't played a whole lot. Um, Aurora faint on the iPhone, which is pretty awesome for a free game. That game is all kinds of awesome. Huh? I had another game. What's that? I downloaded pull position remix. How'd you like that? Um, it's actually surprisingly easy to play, but I still suck at pole position. So, but the crashes and everything are fantastic. I suck the pole position. Uh, black Wolf in chat room says, uh, Rob, like confirmed Rob likes parents exploiting children on the internet. Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's cute. All right. If you don't do this, you don't get to eat. Um, and Ross to UT says, Rob, I have media server and internet running at the same time. No problem. Well, that's you. Congrats to you. All right. It didn't work right for me. I know my special, but now I have all the next gen systems. So there you have it. I did get, you know, if you got pole position on the phone, I will say I got Pac-Man on the iPhone, which is kind of neat. Cause you can do motion. You can tilt it. Yeah. It's kind of dumb. Like you play it once and then it's over. So just get the free trial. Don't pay for it. But, but the pole position one though, honestly, it really is playable. And on top of that, not only can you have it use motion, uh, use, uh, your tilt to turn left to right. You can choose to have your accelerator or your brake on screen. Um, or you can actually have a steering wheel on screen to steer with, or you can use a slider. So that's kind of cool. Um, looking in chat and I'm, I lied. I looked at Justin TV chat for a minute. Um, and the, a person by the name of Sony PS3 sucks. So I'm sure it's just thrilled to hear my news this week says that jelly car is on iPhone for free. I forgot about that. I read about that somewhere. And that was actually a really awesome game on the XNA service. Um, the little beta thing they had there. So I really want to check that out on iPhone. So there you go. All right. Anyhow, uh, real quickly, uh, going around and seeing what other kinds of games, uh, people have been playing this week. Uh, Mel Chan, what's one game you've been playing this week? Sadly, my Japanese coach, your Japanese coach. Well, how, how exactly does it teach you Japanese? Uh, it's actually pretty neat. It's got an interface that you can trace the writing so you can really learn your brush strokes and stuff. It's got a bunch of fun little games to play that actually really have been helping my memory and helping me remember the shit that I learned a few years ago when I actually did take Japanese class. Would you say that it's something that somebody could pick up and learn Japanese with, or is it better a supplement to an actual Japanese class as a supplement to an actual Japanese class? But it is nice because it does have a dictionary and a phrase guide thing built into it. So if you are somewhere, you need to say something that you don't exactly know how to say. You can look up real quick and be like, this is what I need to say. This is how I have to say it. Awesome. Um, Drew, what's one thing you've been playing this week? World of Warcraft, the burning crew. Brains. We have a story coming on that later, but how, how's Wobbling? Are you excited about Lich King? Oh, very excited. I've been, uh, leveling with, uh, Camara lately. Uh, thanks to that recruit a friend thing, triple experience. She and I are going through Outlands as mage and warlock 63. So far it's, it's a blast. What are you most looking forward to about Lich King? Uh, death knights, that and motorcycles. Awesome. Uh, the doctor who, by the way, brought us some mushrooms for the studio. I don't know if you can see them on Justin TV. Can you hold one up for the Justin TV folks? Uh, what the mushrooms look like here. There you go. Look at that. And, uh, those are awesome. Where did you make those just for this? Or did you steal those from your work? Last year, my work, we did Mario as a theme for Halloween. So, uh, one of my coworkers made them. Awesome. Well, thank you for stealing them and bringing them here. Um, what's one game you've been playing this week, doctor? Actually, Hiccup Boy has gotten me back into DDR, which, oh my God, that's like the best exercise ever. You've lost some weight too. Well, maybe like, yeah, just today. Oh my God, because my hand's all sweaty from DDR. What kind of DDR? What? Um, like it's old school DDR. It's like, like extreme DDR from like the arcade. So, but I love it. Like it's good. It's good times. It is. It's very good exercise. And I, I like though the here on our 300th episode, somebody brings up DDR. So thank you. Oh my God. No. And that's, I don't think a boy like you are the one of the DDR Kings. So there you go. There you go. Uh, Arcadian. What, what's one game you've been playing this week? I picked up, uh, Sonic Chronicles yesterday and play that a bit. Nice. It's actually pretty good. What system? So it's a DS DS. And that's like, what is all the old school, old school Sonic games? No, no, it's a new RPG. Oh, I thought it was actually called Sonic RPG. Okay. How is it? Good. It's pretty good so far. I've played like a, like three or four hours. You just halfway the second mission. Is there any other RPGs you can kind of compare to? I don't know. It's a little bit different cause, cause you're kind of moving around with the stylus and the, cause you're not, and actually cause there's an interesting system where you, if you, you got to chase, sometimes you have to chase the enemies or run away from them. So you have to basically have the characters running away or running towards the, uh, the, uh, the enemy. So you have to like make them jump over boxes and stuff. So that kind of, so if you need to escape from an enemy, you're going to kill you. You can try to do that. Or if they want to get away from you, you have to chase them. So if you got four characters, it's really hard to sometimes to actually keep everyone from hitting the boxes so that they don't, that they can catch up. Cool. It sounds like this game might be redeeming the Sonic franchise a little bit after a relatively last few week years. I actually haven't played any of the games and it's for the best. It's for the best Bradley. If you want to stay a Sega fan boy, you probably should stay away from him. All right. Uh, let's also ask Kick Up Boy. Uh, what, what's, what's one game you've been playing this week? Well, um, I kind of haven't, haven't gotten over, um, Cod 4 at all yet. All right. A shooter fan. It's amazing. Except you get those people that just like, Oh, on one on one, I can kick your ass. And then we go on one on one and they leave shortly after that. So what would you say is the singular best thing about that game? The best thing is gotta be just, Hmm. Uh, there's not just one, uh, you looking forward to the COD five. Yeah. Yes and no. Just, they kind of went back in time. So I'm kind of like, Oh, I feel like a back to the future kind of thing. What's something they need to do in COD five they didn't do for four. Um, they need to, um, make sure no juggernaut is allowed. Cause that's just kind of wimpy. All right. There you have it. All right. Um, we're going to move into some, uh, news here, but after some housekeeping here real quick. And, uh, first off I want to say, you know, cause I say it every week, join us on a live journal. Our username on life journals, orange lounge or a my space where orange lounge radio, uh, on Facebook or the OL army. And now on Twitter, we're OLR. Yes. That's four different sites and four different names. Go figure. It just never works out. Um, also I want to say this, uh, since we have been doing this diligently for 300 episodes, uh, we are taking next week off. There will be no show next week. So there you have it. Cause we earned it. We will be providing live footage of, um, a colonoscopy. No, I'm not. Here's the, here's the deal. I'm not having a colonoscopy, but you guys might remember if you've been listening to the show this year, I had some medical issues, um, back in April, um, that kept me out of the show for a week. Uh, I'm having surgery Wednesday and that's why there's not going to be a show on Sunday because I'm still going to be recovering. Um, I'm having a gallbladder removal. I'm sure I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago. It's not a big deal. Other people have had it done. It's laparoscopic, so it's not going to be a big deal, but I am planning to pretty much be out of everything for a week. So there you have it. So now you understand. So no, no kicking and screaming. There's no show. Take a chance to play some more games or listen to one of our other wonderful shows, uh, that we co broadcast with on all games radio. Um, so let's move into some gaming news then tonight, I think if we're ready. Yes. All right. All right. Uh, well, you may remember the, uh, new PSP 3000 was announced and is finally made it to the market. Um, although it's not really being received that well, um, problem is apparently the new advanced, um, LCD screen that's on it is causing some issues with scan lines, noticeable scan lines, and it looks very bad. Um, it is now a little bit brighter and the colors are a little bit better, but the scan lines look like crap and Sony is apparently looking into the problem right now. Um, but no sort of fix is, um, being, uh, taken, you know, being done. And, um, so since this is a phenomenon that is caused by hardware characteristics, there is no plan to fix it with the system software update. So you might want to hold on to those PSP 2000s and forgo the built-in, um, microphone and I don't know, better, uh, questionably better LCD screen. Or maybe just wait a little while for it to get fixed. Is it possible that they're going to like kind of fix these? Um, they're going to have to replace them if that's the case. Interesting. Um, well, what's kind of interesting also is that it seems like there might be some type of very, uh, quiet under the radar recall going on right now. Um, I guess it's because people are, you know, complaining about this and apparently the description actually got like this slight word change going on. Um, instead of saying the system features an improved LCD screen, it says the system features an advanced LCD screen. So you can kind of see that they might be, uh, kind of admitting that there's something going on there. It kind of reminds me of was it, uh, if anyone's watched Invader Zim when he's introduced to his sidekick Gur, he's like, um, he kind of looks broken. They're all, he's not broken. He's advanced. Well, here's the other interesting thing is that amazon.com just suddenly canceled a bunch of pre-orders for the PSP 3000. Um, some folks had the limited edition four gigabyte memory entertainment pack for this thing reserved. Amazon sent everybody emails that said, um, that the item was not available from the sources so that they canceled all the orders. Yeah. In fact, we got some similar that, um, they were expected in probably this week, I guess, but now they've been delayed to middle of January. So there's something going on. Something is afoot at the circle K. All right. So there you have it. Um, I don't know what's going on with the PSP 3000, but maybe you want to be cautious, play a friend's system, play it in stores and see if it's something that bugs you that bad, because I bet to a lot of gamers, um, they're not going to give a shit to be honest. I mean, it looks pretty bad. I mean, but there's a lot of PSP 2000 systems out there and really all you're supposedly improving is the, you know, inner the LCD screen, which obviously is not improved this time and a built-in microphone. So if microphones aren't really big deal for you, I mean, you can go buy one for like 20 bucks. I don't know. So I would just maybe hold off. Besides, why do you, why do you need to buy another system? I mean, after all the last system update came about a year ago. All right. Well, what was that? She didn't have a mic. I said, not to mention, there's hardly any new PSP games coming out. They're like, here's a bunch of new systems without you. We've got like 20 games coming out in the next six months. Have fun. All right. Well, we'll see. We'll see what continues to develop, um, over there and hopefully some PSP games, a lot of good stuff in, um, 2009. We'll see. That could possibly be, but honestly, you know, my opinion on the PSP actually is the same opinion I have on any system. It stinks only as good as the games that are on it, but it does have purple lacrosse, which is a cute game. Okay. Well, this comes as an absolute surprise to no one. Um, because what do you just like gasping into the microphone as if you're in a porn? I'm no one. I'm no one. Do that. Do that a little bit more throaty. No, no, no, I don't. No, no. Okay. Sorry. Anyway. Thank you, Rob. Now you have to mimic the master here. No, I don't. Anyway. Um, well there was, um, the game was trademarked in July, but there is going to be a Star Wars, the old Republic, which is the MMO that's based off of KOTOR, Knights of the Old Republic. Also the term coined by our friend Krista Skrotor when she worked for Lucas back in the day. Anyway. Um, with this, um, it says to be 300 years after, um, Knights of the Old Republic two, which is 3,500 years before the film. And you can choose between either the Republic or the Sith empire. You can either, um, be, uh, light side or dark side. Um, but you can be one of those alignments within whatever your faction is. So I guess you could be chaotic neutral or lawful evil or, Oh, wait, wrong game. Anyway. Um, there's two classes that have been revealed already. That's the Sith, the Jedi, and they use lightsabers and the force. And we have no idea when it's coming out or what it's coming out on, but, but, but, well, can I kill Jar Jar Binks? Jar Jar has not been born yet or conceived. She could probably find, can I find Jar Jar's super great ancestor and killer and super great cut off the fishy cock. That's the fishy cock. Did you just tell me to go slice off the fishy cock? Fish do not have cocks. They deposit their things into the ocean. But they're supposed to be human led creatures. So I assume that there's some cock involved. There's always cock involved. They're aquatic. Okay. Needless to say the internet and the gamers on the internet all had a, needless to say the collective internet gamers had a giant orgasm when this game was announced. Um, all their fish cocks went off at once. Uh, I know there's a fountain of, there's a lot of people definitely looking forward to a KOTOR MMO. A fountain of time ago. I've heard there are people that are going to leave wow for this. We'll see, just like you and I are going to go play Star Trek. But I'm not leaving wow because guess what? I am. I already left. I know. Fuck your KOTOR. We've got Star Trek MMO coming out. We're going to have some Star Trek. There's a Star Trek MMO coming out? Where the fuck have you been? Can I cream my shorts right now? Because I love Star Trek so much. Can you stand up so I can see? Star Trek Online. This is still Star Trek Online. But what time period? Uh, after current. I think it's set like 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. Oh man. So you get your own joystick for your ship. Or the Klingon Empire again though. No. Yes. All right. And Janeway's dead and Picard's dead. Well Janeway could still be alive. Sounds awesome. She can. All right. Anyhow. What? You can do customizing on your ship. So you can uh, calibrate the dilithium crystal. And I want there to be an achievement called Red Shirt Massacre. What? Oh wait. If it's set in that series. Okay. If it was red shirts first and then yellow in Next Generation, then what color are they going to go to for the next series to come out? Magenta. Magenta shirts. No. All right. I'm going to get some questions or some comments from chat. Rasteel UT says, what I'm concerned about with Old Republic is that A, virtually, this virtually guarantees no KOTOR 3 and B, Bioware's never done an MMO before. I can't shake the idea that they might try to ape WoW. WoW's a good game. Let's see. We also have GS68 says, I was going to get a PSP 3000 for Christmas, but I think I'll just save for a desktop arcade pop and con. We'll see. SJ100 Matt says, I'm waiting for the OLR Starfleet. All right. Let's move on with some more news. Back to PlayStation 3. Well, PlayStation Home isn't even out yet and it's already been hacked. So, you know, just like anything else that's Sony, especially the PSP, it has been hacked. The beta client has apparently been decrypted and hackers, especially this guy I guess named streetskaterfu, apparently he has decrypted over 9,000 files belonging to it and this is supposedly going to lead to better understanding how PlayStation 3 games and the PlayStation Network works and its structure. So apparently it's all backend stuff and it'll allow you to, well, they're going to hopefully allow it to lead to other exploits and possibly custom stuff for the cross media bar and all that fun stuff. I don't know, right now it's a whole bunch of nothing, but it's progress and progress is always good, I guess. You know what I think is hilarious? That these people do this as a hobby. You know what? I bet the one, I bet the best way to end all the hacking and everything is to offer these guys jobs. Oh no, they wouldn't do that. It would actually be original content. We don't want that. Pay them. We want rehashes of everything. Yeah, but how long before Sony tries to close this gap? I mean, the home's not even out yet really. Yeah, not very long, but you know, hey, I don't know, it's neat I guess. It's fun to say, hey look, I hacked home. Hey, I'm skaterfu, I hacked home. But what's kind of neat though, speaking of the home beta, if you do want to get into the home beta, just keep an eye out for the next issue of Core, which is going to do some features behind the scenes regarding home, and they're also going to have home beta entries. So you will be able to test home before home launches, whenever home actually launches, although it's probably going to launch soon. Well, do you remember on last week's show, there was a big to-do about the whole censorship in the game LittleBigPlanet, and how one of the songs controversially quoted the Quran in its lyrics, and Sony was going to patch, they were really nervous about this, they're going to patch the game, take the lyrics out. It was retarded. Well, here's the thing, it's kind of an interesting follow-up to this whole thing, is that we're kind of waiting for comment from the other side, like what's the community going to think, what's the rest of the Muslim community going to think if this word gets out there, this is in the game. Well, you might be surprised at what happened. M. Zoudi Jasir, MD, and he is the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, he talked to a website called Edge Gaming, or the Edge Game Network, and he said something kind of interesting here. He said that censorship and Sony being willing to bend at the request for censorship is counterproductive to the freedom of speech. Let me give you this quote, to demand that the game be withdrawn is predicated on a society which gives theocrats who wish to control speech far more value than the central principle of freedom of expression upon which the very practice and freedom of religion is based. The fact that the music writer is a devout Muslim should highlight that at the core of this issue is not about offending all Muslims but only about freedom of expression and the free market. He says he himself does not endorse the use of the Quran verses in non-educational video games, but he says in this case basically that the first amendment takes precedence and that the Islamic foundation stands against all forms of censorship. So, interesting. I think that's beautiful and isn't that sort of what we said last week? In a way, in a way, so it's uh it's it it is kind of interesting to see that now Sony has almost a little bit of egg on it they just can't win with this. Rice Princess was called and she said censorship equals... Thank you. Is she coming tonight? Actually she's she's sick so she's gonna try to make it. Isn't she far princess now? Yeah she is far princess. No she's sick she's gonna try to make it though. All right. But you know everybody say a fire princess. All right. All right. Let's move on and talk about some uh oh by the way just real quick note on Little Big Planet the 1.02 patch is out now and uh it basically just strips the lyrics out of the song. Yeah it doesn't take the song out just removes the lyrics which is fine. There you go. Because I didn't understand what they meant anyway so we're right here. Didn't didn't they have a very habit to do about this way back in the day with that game War Gods didn't they didn't uh when the tracks in that game quote the Quran or something they took that out. Oh who knows. This has been an issue for a while with other games you'd think people would learn. I honestly... It just seems like bullshit to me the whole time. It really is. Oh sorry I should be watching my language. Oh fuck that okay. It's like I said last week if they wanted to be offended at somebody they should have been offended at the artist that made the song who which I think is completely retarded anyway since he himself as stated was a devout Muslim so whatever. Yeah but isn't that so he he was a Muslim the guy that wrote the song because there's like you know like there's Ninju and that's made like by a Jewish guy like have you seen Ninju? No. No I haven't. All right before we unravel more controversy on the program tonight let's get to some release dates. Dark Sakura. Hey. Take us to the UK. In the UK we have Jesus Christ Supercop. I'm sorry.

Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, Fracture and Grand Theft Auto IV all coming out this week. Again, that's Xbox 360. On the PlayStation 3, I imagine very similar stuff. Yes, Fracture is also coming out on the PlayStation 3, as is Grand Theft Auto IV. I guess some type of... No, is that the new one? No, we're waiting for V, aren't we? So, I don't know why this is just now coming out. Grand Theft Auto IV? Oh, never mind. I'm getting confused because right above it I'm reading Grand Turismo. Never mind. Hello. Okay, so yes, Japan finally gets their version of Grand Theft Auto IV. Grand Turismo V Prologue does come out in Japan this week. Spec 3. And Little Big Planet also makes its way to Japan this week on the 30th. And Grand Turismo V Prologue hasn't come out in... This is Spec 3, so it's probably like new... It's probably different cars to get people to buy it again. Sorry. Hey, now wait a minute. Sorry for the use of that term, but that's gay. Seriously. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I need to play something for Loki. Hold on, stop the show. Stop the show. I need to play something for Loki here. Hey, check out this shit, right? Right? It's so gay. It's really gay. Look at those pants. Please don't say that. What? Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something is dumb or stupid. It's insulting. It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said, man, this pepper shaker is so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache. Just saying. When you say that's so gay, do you realize what you say? Knock it off. She's so sassy. Me too. All right. Her show got canceled, so she sucks. I love her. I just downloaded one of her routines. All right. That's all right. I completely understand, you know, the use of, you know, gay and stuff, but I know, I know. I'm just messing with you. That's the whole point. I know you don't really mean it. On the Nintendo Wii, nevermind. I'm not going to get political right now. Nintendo Wii, My Sims Kingdom comes out this week, as does Bokuju Monogatari, Waku Waku Animal March, yay, on the Wii, as well as Hula Wii, Mina Di Furo Odoro, and Shape Boxing, We Day Enjoy Diet. It's probably Everybody Hula Hoop, which would be a very interesting game. I don't know how you make a game out of that. Hey, on the PlayStation 2, Scarlet, Nichijou no Kaiyou Kaisen comes out, as well as Thunder Force 6 comes out from Sega, and Yumemi Hakusho, Second Dream makes its way to the PlayStation 2. On the Nintendo DS, ChocoBox comes out, Dr. Slump and Arale-chan. Is ChocoBox chocobo-boxing? Because that would be amazing. Dr. Slump was done by the artist that did Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. Ah, there you go. It is chocobo-boxing. Let's get back to boxing with ChocoBox. ChocoBox is not a game. It's a case for your DS. What are they making chocobo-boxing? That'd be pretty awesome. Tales of Innocence gets a price reduction, and a game called Vitamin Y comes out. Why? Because. Lastly, on the Sony PSP, is there anything coming out this week? Well, you actually would be surprised. Yes, there's quite a bit coming out this week. Cardinal Arc Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G gets a price reduction into the best, as does Rockman Rockman. That would just be, you know, you know how they remade Mega Man 1 for the PSP. It's just that. It's that whole thing. All right, that's it for Japanese release dates. Let's go back to some more gaming news. Do we gotta? Yes, we gotta. Well, this is about death. Cool. ULTIMATE FINAL CHARACTER DEATH. A 43-year-old Japanese woman was arrested for killing her virtual husband on MapleStory. I know, where's our stupid person music, Rob? Wait, did she kill him in-game? She killed him in-game. Oh, okay. But she got arrested for killing him in-game? Or did she kill him for real? Here's what happened. No, she killed him in- She- This is what happened. She, um, she's a piano teacher. 43-year-old piano teacher was furious because, um, she had been divorced in-game. So she accessed his login and deleted his character. So she killed him in-game. She's, um, in jail in Sapporo, um, and she's facing charges of illegally accessing a computer and manipulating data. Um, her in-game husband was a 33-year-old office worker. And, um, I, I really don't know what he thinks, so there's no comment about that. But this happened last May and, um, the woman could, um, pay fines and potentially a five-year jail sentence if she's convicted. Dude, it's MapleStory. Who gives a shit? God, I know! Isn't that the biggest irony in this whole crappy story? It's- Get over yourself! It's fucking MapleStory. And besides that, what does it matter? Oh my God. Thank God. I hope I can't- She probably deleted, like, a couple years worth of data and- I hope I can't be held accountable for all the people I killed. You spend time working on that kind of shit. DJ Dark Knight says it's a huge crime in Japan. I- no, look, this is the thing. I, I understand it and honestly, I, I would, you know, want some sort of, you know, retaliation. She did break the law. She illegally accessed his information and she broke the law. However, I just think it's so fucking retarded that this is MapleStory! It's free! It's Ma- Okay, okay. I would be pissed off if someone did that to my Ragnarok account. I would be pissed off if that happened on my Ragnarok account. You know, but it's not the end of the world. Five years in jail? I mean, God, pissing you off is bad enough. Can you imagine the phone call? What do you mean pissing me off is bad enough? What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Rob? Exactly. Exactly as it was intended. Can you imagine the, the phone call? I'd like to report a murder of my character in MapleStory. Okay, see, I was thinking of the World of Warcraft- Hello? Uh, South Park episode. It's like, and, and he's killing people's characters. Mom! Bathroom! Bathroom! I am such an achievement, Hornau. Um, anyhow, hey, let's move on with the news. Sorry, I've been distracted because the doctor has boobs now. And boobs are distracting. Uh, anyways- Ew. So- So that's what kind of doctor you are. That's a doctor. Hello, doctor. Now, um- Doctor. Apparently, Guitar Hero World Tour is facing some drum issues, um, as some other, um, hosts, uh, so, uh, viciously- Eloquently put it on previous shows. Viciously described, um, there's some issues with the drums, um, not sensing the hits, um, in this case- Sorry, that's to come later, ignore that. I let the, I let the audio run too long again, my bad. Shame, shame. Fucking drums aren't fucking working right. Anyway, so the drums aren't working correctly. Basically, they're either not sensing hits, or they're just playing, not doing anything. They're faulty like this show. They're very faulty. I mean, personally, I kind of called that they were faulty, but for whole different reasons. I mean, the thing looks like it's made out of PVC, and was seriously, like, rocking when people were playing it, and not rocking in the good way. But, I don't know. I think as, uh, Bobby Blackwolf put it on his show, if they're gonna brag that their instruments are better than, you know, Rock Band's instruments, then maybe they should work. Let's start with the working first. That's the only sound my, uh, Guitar Hero drums will make. I have, I have pumpkiny goodness in me, by the way, Rob. Thank you. You're welcome. We're eating pumpkin bagels here in Studio Justino. We are? I am. Yeah, that's fine. Actually, eat that Halloween candy. I can't have the candy, and John doesn't want it. So, bring the thing out here. Make everybody eat it. Give some to Justin TV. I don't care. All right. Hey, um, big news this week. Oh, my God. Huge news about, um, something, uh, we here at Orange Mountains Radio used to cover every year, and then kind of stopped. E3 is coming back. That's right. E3 2009, uh, is coming back the way we know it. Not this whole, like, scale down show we had, um, going on. This whole scale down show we had going on for just the media only, and the super special secret club invite is going away. Basically, I hope so. E3 is going to be just like it was before. However, that doesn't mean that anybody's going to be able to get in. It's not public. It's just, you know, it's going to be back to the same audience. Come on. When it was originally going on anyways, it was almost public. It's like I work at Walmart or I know someone that works at Walmart in the garden department because they, you know, it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or something like that. It's like I work in a store that looks at video games and therefore, you know, I should be able to go. I have a crappy podcast on the internet. It's been going for six years. I get to go. What? This means that we need to get our business stuff set back up. Yeah, we got to go. We're going. It'll be fun. Yeah, that's going to be tough. I'm going to try to get the wife to let me go, but uh, ouch. Tell her Fable 3 will be there. This is how it works at my house. Hey Dan, I'm going to E3. Okay. Yeah, but you can do that. He can come with me. By the way, he's come with me every year. The website Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q, actually interviewed the president of the ESA, Doug Lowenstein, and he actually said if you had to give, they asked him if you had to give E3 a six letter word or less tagline, what would it be? And uh, I'm sorry. Doug Lowenstein was the former president of the ESA. Now it's Mike Gallagher. Sorry, my bad. I just haven't been to E3 in so long. Mike Gallagher calls it the must attend event of 2009. That's what he's calling it. And they're saying it's going to be 40,000 or more in attendance. I believe that the last E3 was 70,000. And then they're complaining. Why are there so many people going in there and then Paris Hilton will be there pimping out whatever. I want to know what's the heavy cynicism for there in the back. When it was an industry only thing, it still was going down the tubes and you had better things like, you know, Leipzig and uh, PAX as the true gamers conventions. I mean, even for the industry, it's just not that good anymore. I'm kind of curious what effect this is going to have on PAX. If that's going to cause less people to want to go to PAX now, because they'll want to use their vacation on E3. Cause not everybody can take vacation all the time. You know what I mean? Honestly, if I had to choose between the two though, to be perfectly honest, I want to go to PAX again. I really want to go to PAX again. You know, PAX was a lot of fun. PAX was more of like the gamer show, but I'm a greedy bastard. I'm going to go to both. Hello. No, I'd love to go to both. I'd especially like to see what this E3 revival is, you know? But if I had to pick between one or the other, I would pick PAX. There you go. Uh, so orange launch radio live from E3 this June. What? If we do go to E3, we're totally freaking going to Disneyland. We'll see what we can do. We are. Yes, ma'am. Cause I, so what? Tea cups. Tea cups for the win and California screaming. All right. Let's move on with the news or we'll never get to Disneyland. Yes. But, you know what Disneyland could use more of? Zombies! You know what Call of Duty is getting more of? Um, my story. Well, I'm sorry. You were just talking about Disneyland and I stopped listening. Okay. Go ahead. Well, it was E3's revival. What happens to E4All? It gets flushed down the toilet. I don't have a toilet flush noise. Yup, there's no more E for All and I'm laughing my ass off. Why? Why all the negativity? There's too much cynicism in here tonight. I'm just laughing my ass off at all the people who said that, um, that E for All is gonna be the end all, the place to go, and we're gonna be all at E for All. And I'm like... Well, it definitely was the end all. Fuck you, I'm going to PAX. Nice. But seriously, I've heard from so many people about oh, E for All this and E for All that and I'm like, screw you. But they had fatality. Whatever. We got to, we got to do fatalities in DC vs Mortal Kombat, okay? Oh my god, we got someone who holds his, holds his mouth funny. Rob and I got to have the Katana Catwoman fight and that was epic. It was pretty cool. Plus, I got to meet Jonathan Coulton and Wil Wheaton and I couldn't do that at E for All. Uh, Jenai in chat makes the, uh, mandatory joke here that I think is pretty clever. E for End. Did you hear that one, Jenai? E for End. Aww, that's perfect. I was telling Mel about Wil Wheaton signing my iPhone and it rubbing off by the end of the day. But you saw it. I did see it. I'd said, now my phone is an extra limited edition and so he put a 1 slash 1 on it. That was pretty funny. Alright, now we can talk about zombies. That's what, because that's what you're going to see at E3 this year. A bunch of unshowered, unslept zombies. We should hand out care packs. Okay, no, we should, we should hand out con care packs like they did at AX that one year where they handed out deodorant and soap. Yeah, but unless you're going to put it on them yourself, it's not going to do any good. What's this? Cans of Axe. I can't use this, start away. Axe smells freaking good. Axe is better than confunk. Confunk is good. Confunk is... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know what smells better than confunk? Cat piss. I'll take your word for it. How about zombies? Yes, zombies. Apparently the megaton bomb that was dropped by Game Trailers TV was that Call of Duty World of War is going to feature a four-player co-op zombie mode. That totally doesn't rip off of another game that's very similar having a four-player co-op zombie mode in it. Left 4 Dead. So I guess, you know, hey they want to make sure that people know that their game has zombies too. Wow, that's so World of War. You know, I remember the zombie wars back in World War II. My grandpa used to tell me all about those, how the zombies would attack and everything. Ah, yes, the zombies. Thank goodness that we, you know, defeated them and showed them democracy. Democracy! Bringing it to the rest of the world. And no zombies, because zombies are bad. But thankfully though Treyarch is able to come back and tell the you know, lost battles of zombies. You know, the part that was left out of the history books. Conspiracy, I say! No, but seriously, they're going to have four-player zombies and you'll be able to do zombie stuff. Can you eat brains? Yes or no? Well this sounds like it's basically, it's kind of weird though. There's a whole bunch of games this fall that have zombie things in them. Like Saints Row 2 has zombies in it. There's like a zombie game within the game. And now there's a zombie game within this. And then there's a zombie game coming out. There's zombie Xbox Live Arcade games. Zombie PlayStation Network games. It's like, seriously, Moonwalker! Brains or no brains? Actually, I do have to say there's something that completely bothers me about zombie games. About games with zombies in them. How you don't have a stench meter. In zombie movies and zombie games, why is it that you can't tell where the fucking zombies are by how much their decayed asses stink? They're decaying bodies. They're going to smell like rotten meat. Maybe someday there'll be a smell-o-vision. But, you know, nobody in zombie movies are so surprised that the zombies are there when they should have been able to freakin' smell corpse stench. Yeah, I know. You have games like, I don't know, Thief with sound meters. Why can't you have smell meters? Maybe there's a lot of zombies and so because they all smell like rotting flesh, the whole place smells like rotting flesh so you can't tell where it's coming from. It should still be stronger the closer you get to that much contained stench. It's just... It's like an anime con. It's just like last night. You can tell when you're getting close to the dealer's room by the stink. No, no, no, no. You can tell when you're getting close to the cosplay competition It's like a Dave Matthews Band concert. You can tell when you're getting close to the smell of marijuana. No, when you're getting close to the cosplay competition is when you stop smelling funk and start smelling other things. I don't know if you heard Drew, but the Grateful Dead. The one guy's keeping on trucking in heaven. I don't know if you've heard. Alright. He's gratefully dead. Anyhow. Unless he's a zombie! In which case, you need to know how to defeat zombies by playing this game. Or Left 4 Dead. Or Saints Row 2. Or another zombie game. World of Warcraft. Which has also started the zombie invasion. That's right. Zombie invasion has been hitting World of Warcraft and there's been just craziness going on. Earlier in the week, there was infections going on. If you would kill an infected critter or the like, you would get turned into a zombie in 10 minutes and then you could create other zombies. It was like a disease that was spread around. Well, as the week's been going on, now it takes 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie. 15 seconds? I thought it was one minute. No, that happened to me earlier today. It took me 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie. The more you get hit by zombies, the faster they shave off times. You gotta visit an Argent healer. Or if they haven't been turned into a zombie. Or you have a priest or paladin remove the disease. All last night I was going on my priest through Orgrimmar making sure all the auction house street dealers were clean. Yeah, apparently it's a popular thing to do is turn yourself into a zombie and then do a zombie explode. Because one thing you can do, you can just explode. You can self-destruct as a zombie and spread your infection everywhere. So a lot of people have just been walking into the auction house and exploding. And apparently they don't like the people who are cleaning up after the zombies. They don't like the priests. They don't like the pallys. Oh, you're ruining our fun. Hi, you guys are going to low-level zones and killing everything. Exactly. You know, does anyone find this slightly offensive that there's people walking around into, I don't know, public buildings and exploding? I mean... There's zombies. Don't blame them, there are zombies. Everything is okay when it's zombies and green blood. It's not real. There were zombies that ate too many Twinkies. So if some zombies flew a plane into a building, that would be okay too. They're zombies! Matt... I'm just checking. Alright, because this is the World of Warcraft game that you're playing, and I don't see any recalls on that. Yes, alright. Well, we did have people getting infected and then flying to other cities and then exploding when they got there. The zombified in mid-flight. You can't explode in mid-flight? They can't explode in mid-flight, but they can explode as soon as they land. Tenris Murkblood is a new boss that you can fight in Karazhan. My guild just took him down today, and it was actually a fun fight. But you only are going to be able to see him for 10 days, which basically means if you don't play him tonight or Monday, you have one chance because of the resets in Karazhan. So, he drops an axe that is awesome. He will drop this axe every time. He only drops two things. A little bat pet for everybody in the raid, and an axe that when you use it, your character suddenly becomes a zombie or an undead, basically. It starts jamming like it's Guitar Hero. It goes... It's awesome. Rob, get an extra one. We can't. Only Nathan got one today. Look at that! Now they're ripping off Darkstalkers! Awesome! Arcanite Ripper! Arcanite can rip off. Yeah, and I see XLink in chat says, Grand Theft Auto IV has zombies too. Yeah, they started putting out this thing like it was going to be an expansion or something like that, but really they're just talking about the stupid viral achievement that they've had since the beginning of the game, when it came out. And... Tom, talk about like non-news, but they decided, hey, we're going to jump in on the zombie fun as well, even though this has been around forever. I want to point out, since we just started tonight's show, a new phase just kicked in. Phase five and a half just started tonight as we went live. Apparently what's happened, now there are quests all of a sudden available in the main cities that send you to the faction leader, and at some point you're going to be whispered by some type of either a frozen shade or a plagued brain that's going to be taunting you to join their forces. And there's some type of quest going on to hopefully clean the world of the plague. Interesting. So it's all going on right now in the world of Warcraft. Bathroom. Bathroom. More gaming news. Well, there's another game called Pain, and there is a character showing up in Pain that you can beat the shit out of. Guess who that would be? I don't know. David Hasselhoff! And he actually thinks that it's completely, he actually said that it was hysterical, he's quoted as saying that, and that he thinks that it's really great that he gets to be in it. And there's also his version of Do You Really Want to Hurt Me? as the title to an in-game track, so I think that's pretty fun. Wow, you know that's just... What the fuck was that? Rob's computer farted. I don't know what's going on. Well, hello Rice Princess, glad to see you just arrived. I think a zombie is attacking us, actually. What the hell was that about? That was some weird shit. Anyways, I was going to say, that's reason enough to hurt him. Well, also he's doing his own voice, so this information was provided to me by the lovely and talented Zoss. Now I want to point out there's a new song available in Pain. I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me I couldn't resist. You gotta love a guy that actually is famous for doing that shit. I mean, seriously, you know what, it's like, I wonder if he's just like, what can I do that's so ridiculous that people would still like me? And he keeps making these songs and he's like, okay, people gotta hate me now. And then they're still like buying his albums and he's still rich and putting them on TV shows and stuff. I don't know. He's still convinced that he's instrumental in the Berlin Wall coming down. Rama in chat says... They love him in Germany. Rama in chat says, I actually like this song. I only read that so that our, you know, thousands of listeners could hear that. That's Rama, R-A-N-M-A, likes that song. DSSJ100 Matt says, we got Hofrolled. Yes you did. Yes you did. Alright, a little more gaming news than the classic Game of the Week and then a break. If you bought Rock Band 2, you'll know that on the back of your manual, it says you can get 20 free tracks available at a later date. Well, that later date is now November 4th and there are 20 different tracks you can get. And to be honest, I don't know any of these artists at all. So, real quick I'm going to read them off. The 88 Sons and Daughters. Authority Zero, no regrets. Between the Buried and Me, prepare to the sequel. The Cab with Bounce. The Chevelle's, get it on. The Cocktail Slippers, give it to me. Dealership with Database Corrupted. End Ever After with I Wanna Be Your Man. The Ghost Town's Ashes to Fire. Hollywood Undead, Young. The Cutlass, The Feeling. The Len Price 3, If I Ain't Got You. Lesley Roy, I'm Gone, I'm Going. Opiate for the Masses, Burn You Down. Semi-Precious Weapons, Magnetic Baby. Shamius with Like a Fool. Magnetic Baby? I don't know. The Nuno 2, Crazy Tuesday. Tickle Me Pink with The Time is Wrong. Under oath with Desperate Times, Desperate Measures, and X Japan with IV. I have no idea any of those songs. I know that actually we were really excited about getting some X Japan. But hey, at least they're free, and free is awesome. No bitching, it's free. And there might be some cool songs in there that you've never heard of before. So make sure that you register before the 4th, I mean you probably can afterwards, but if you want to make sure you get it day 1, register at rockband.com slash bonus tracks, and they will send you an email with your code to download them once they become available. Awesome. What about what they're releasing for the people that want to pay? Well, for the people that want to pay, there's going to be some other stuff coming out as well. Including, they've got Hong Kong Gardens, Kiss Them For Me, and Killing Jar. Yay! And that's all by Soozee and the band Cheese. Yay! Which is like one of the greatest bands ever. Dammit by Blink 182, that song that Rob was talking about the little girl singing earlier in Sing Star. Let's see here, looks like Metal Onan by the Silver Star, or Silver Sun Pickups. Well Thought Out Twinkies by or Twinkles, Twinkies would be funny though. Well Thought Out Twinkles by Silver Sun Pickups, and Pretty In Pink by Psychedelic Furs. That's cool. You know what though, who cares, because it has Soozee and the band Cheese in it, so all the rest of that is just crap. Oh my god, Rob are you straight now? No, I just love Soozee and the band Cheese, they're awesome. She was on the Basement Jacks song too. They had a really cool video on top of it. There you go. Kish Cash. It's funny, my band right now thankfully, because I'm not playing Rock Band 2, but my friend is on my account so it counts, but we're in the top 600 now. Wow. Dang. Yes, I know, I'm very pleased at my progress in the game. Oh, just to let people know, our band name at my house is Detachable Penis. Like the King Missile song. Did it not get banned? No. Interesting. The one I've been playing in mostly is actually Shane's band, it's Emergency Kittens. That's the name of our band. Does the Sassy Squad sing backup? No. That's just a Warcraft fan. But is Fluffles Trainset the third? No. Alright, hey, by the way if you want a real band game, you know, the hell with Rock Band or Guitar Hero get Rock Revolution. No, I'm kidding, I'm just so kidding. No, you want this Strong Bad Episode 3, The Baddest of the Bands is coming out. It's Episode 3, it comes out on the PC and WiiWare when? Right now. Or Monday for those of you listening live, it's tomorrow. October 27th, it's going to be as always 1,000 Wii Points or $10. That's coming out from Telltale Games. So there you have it those of you that are enjoying the Strong Bad games probably want to pick that up. And if you haven't picked up a Strong Bad game yet, you might want to do that. And yes, I'm talking to myself because I still have not played the Strong Bad series. I really need to. Is the ban over, Rob? No, you know your boycott's not over yet, is it? No, I can play it on PC. That's right. So that's what I plan to do. Oh, your boycott, because your memory is full. Yeah, I'm boycotting the Wii download stuff. Your memory is full. Although, well I don't know, I'm iffy on it because they have announced the remedy for it. Wait, what did, have you already announced that on the show, what the remedy is? Yeah, they did announce they are going to let you run things off SD cards. But when's that happening, though? That's a thing. So that's going to be a patch, right? Yeah, probably a patch. Alright, anyhow hey, we're not even halfway done with this show yet, if you can believe it. We're going to take a break here pretty soon. But first, we always like to end part A of our program by taking a trip to the past and revisiting the archives and trying to pick out a classic game of the week. Now, as I understand though, tonight's game, because it is episode 300, Dark Sakura had to pick like a fucking epic classic. Am I correct? I sure did. Alright, well let's get to it. My classic game, actually I'm not going to say the title of it to begin with. It should begin with the intro to the game. Which everyone will get from the first Tones. And I'm getting grins from over here looking at my laptop. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. That only sounds like a porn star. Oh yeah. Do we get it yet kids? Oh yeah. No it's not Castlevania. It's Gutsman. Oh yeah. Tora is the first person to guess. And stop spamming the room now please. You get a no prize. Stop it! Okay, someone kick Tora out of the chat room please. Right the fuck now. Thank you. Okay, the classic game is Final Fantasy 6, which we got over here on Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy 3. Play the best music in the game ever please. This is the overworld music, which is also called Terra's theme. Although in the Japanese version her name was Tina. Best music in the game. Sorry. That's just my own opinion. And Sausa's best game ever. I think this is probably one of the best video game songs ever. This game is the reason why I skipped a week of high school. While I had the flu. But that's beside the point. My flu was prolonged. No, no. I started off having the flu and my grandma rented the game for me. And I ended up just having the flu a little bit longer than I really did. But the one thing about this one is it was the first in the series that was not done by Sakaguchi. It was done by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. And this is considered pretty much the pinnacle of it. Although I really, really like Final Fantasy 5 a whole lot too. It has the largest playable cast of any Final Fantasy game to date. Pretty much it's standard Final Fantasy. You have your overworld map and you have your dungeons and you have your towns and you've got your chocobo and you have your airship and random encounters on land. This one also has your espers which give you your magic and you keep improving. And it's still menu based combat. I mean it's Final Fantasy basically. There were a few different innovative attacks. Like Selle's had the runic attack which could reflect magical attacks back at somebody. Although I'll be honest, I rarely ever freaking use that except for that one battle where you had to. And I'm actually still playing this right now too. But this has, for the active time battle system, you actually can pick any character that has filled up their action bar and you don't have to pick the first one that pops up. You can actually change out which one you want to use as long as their bar is their first. And this actually was incorporated into later ones. You could customize your characters by your relics to change their stats. You could work with their spells a little bit. You could equip their magicite which is like I was saying is basically some of the espers helps with magic. They have the magic acquisition points for each time. You gain APs. You level up. This particular game is where basically you've got this one girl named Terra in the Japanese version. It was Tina. And they find her and she can do magic. And everyone's like, Oh my god! Magic! I'm going to barf! And then the rest of the story comes off. This also has Kefka which is the most annoying laugh in a video game ever. Somebody poison the water hole! But he had the best boss theme ever. Actually I really like Jenova's better. But anyway. The one other really cool thing that I thought about this game is that it's very punk. Really it is. I mean you've got steam powered mecha in the game. It's all very early industrial. Magitek. You have your magitek armor. You've got you know the empire in that is pretty much a magical industrial type mesh. I know it's so fantastic. And you have toilets in it. You can use the toilet. Did you know that? What if you don't use the toilet? Because in Sims that's not good. If you're in the empire castle or whatever and you're in one of the cells you can actually sit on the toilet and squat down on it. And then when you hop off the toilet it flushes. Do they take down their little pants to do that? No they have a trap door. They do? Okay. Also Saw says it has the freakiest clown in a video game ever. But you've got some of the best characters in this. I actually really liked GoGo. I really liked GoGo. Because of the weird stuff he did. I loved Gal who was the little feral boy. And Mog wasn't you get Mog. I don't know why we're having mic issues in studio. Is it? Oh keep it away from interference. I'm sorry. But Rob do me a favor Alright I'll try to find it. This game had the single most hardcore awesome character in it. Which was um. We'll get to him in a second. But the main characters you have Terra slash Tina. You've got Locke who's your thief. You have Sillies who's treasure hunter. You have Sabin who's your martial artist. This is a special rendition of it. Oh no wait. Here we go. But here's the man. Shadow the ninja. Who we used to call Snake Eyes. And you have Realm was cool. She had the drawing attack. And you had her grandfather who's the blue mage. And you had what's-his-face who looked like Billy Dee Williams. Who was the Doma castle guy. But he looked like Billy Dee. Sorry he looks like Billy Dee Williams. Edgar was the best. I bet he does. Edgar was awesome. Because it was all about the autocrossbow. And the chainsaw. And the graphics actually were the characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano and they were actually converted to sprite. And there were also in the Playstation version that came out later the actual videos that were in the game were directly from Amano's designs. That was pretty cool. It was one of the, it's not the first one that used mode 7 but it used extensive mode 7 in this for lots of scaling and scrolling. It was really fantastic. When it was localized there were changes like a little bit of nudity. For example. One of the painting bosses. Yes one of those. Also different characters for their full names. They romanized them differently so that they would fix a six, fit a six character slot. They were also changed quite a bit from Terra to Tina from Mash to Sabin. From Kayen to Sion. But I think that they picked it in the way that people would most be able to relate to it. Text, a lot of dialogue was shortened. Because again it could only store a certain number of characters and I'm sorry Japanese lends itself a lot easier to extended conversation within a limited character allotment because it's syllabic and English isn't. This is so awesome. This is the opera scene which is to this day I think one of the most memorable ever scenes in any video game ever are. It really is. Did you see what they did for the Dear Friends concert where they did the opera scene in Japanese. I saw YouTube of it. It was just fantastic. It was so beautiful. And here's actually one that we should realize about the music. We've kept bringing up the music during this. It was actually done by Uematsu who wrote all of the music in the game. Did everything for every location, all the battles different themes. They actually use the music from the games in Japanese music classes in Japan. Also they wanted to use an actual voice for the opera but the SBC 700 chip would not allow an actual voice track so that's why they used the...well it would basically be the Vox Organa or Vox Humana thing for organ is what I recognized. The sound chip itself didn't support the voices but later on you had games like Tales of Fantasia and Star Ocean that did have actual voice samples. But we're talking about full vocal track. It wouldn't support a full vocal track. It would support something that was short. The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace. It's about as much as you can get. Or the clay fighters opening. For the Final Fantasy 6 Grand Finale album it actually was rearranged as an aria using an actual singer in full accompaniment and this version was also in the full motion video in the Playstation version so it was pretty cool. You can actually get...I've got the full soundtrack to this. You can get all kinds of arranged versions but there's also some pretty good versions of this some of the music in the game and some of the Final Fantasy compilation discs. Although I still think that the best of the compilation ones, which I don't think has any from this game in it, is still Celtic Moon and Prey was very good. Prey had some stuff in here. We did, like I said, we got a Playstation version but there's also Final Fantasy 6 Advance which came out on DS. There's four new espers in this one which is Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar and Diabolos. I think it was on Game Boy Advance. Sorry, that's the Game Boy Advance one. I wish it was on DS, that'd be awesome. Yeah, well that's the one I've been playing through until my DS broke. Also for this game, as of March 31, 2003 it shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide which is 2.6 million in Japan alone and 860,000 overseas and continued to be one of the best selling games of all time. Did you, in that week that you were home with it, did you beat it in the week, did you play it like non-stop? No, I didn't actually. You should have. I've had tons of other stuff to do. I'm in school, dude. Anyway, another neat thing about this though and this is what made me all hyper, is that when I don't know if you remember when the Nintendo 64 was in production, or sorry, when testing, they actually made a demonstration for the Nintendo 64 using the cast from Final Fantasy 7 in a big battle, I think versus Bahamut which I found video of finally and it's freaking crazy looking. Which is what we're looking at right now in studio. It was gonna be too expensive, right, to put on a cartridge to do the game, right, for Final Fantasy 7? Well, basically it was actually done on Silicon Graphics hardware when they first put it out, but Square hadn't yet committed and the technology in the game was not up to their parts. They actually wanted to move it to PlayStation for the sake of full motion video. Which the PlayStation, of course, could easily handle. But the demo actually had Terra, Locke, and Shadow. And it was controlled actually through using a mouse instead of, you know, actual, like with a control. There was also Final Fantasy 6, the interactive CG game which was actually also called Final Fantasy X. Not a Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X. Which was the same demonstration, but with better touch-ups, textures. Oh no, this was basically... But this was basically what they were using. It was a sort of touchdown version that they were using for the Nintendo 64 demo test, but this was more to demonstrate the actual use of CG in the thing, so that's pretty cool. So that's our classic game is Final Fantasy 6. Oh good, because I was running out of music. That was long. That's alright. It's worth it. That game deserves it. I knew that this game would require a ton of attention, so how could we not dedicate more time to it? And it's Episode 300. I mean, hell, we have to pick the pinnacle. Alright. I don't know how you're going to follow that next week. Alright. Because it's not better than Super Metroid. Whatever. You know what? Honestly, you know, I actually like Final Fantasy 6 even more so than I do Chrono Trigger, so if any game you're going to say competes for the best game of all time next to Super Metroid, I could see Final Fantasy 6. I would actually say Final Fantasy 6 is overall... Now, I used to say I really liked Final Fantasy 5 a whole lot, and I'll probably do that as a later game, because of how customizable the job change system was, and Final Fantasy 3 was the first one to do that of the Japanese releases, which was actually really fun, too. If anyone can find a translation of it, play it. It's fantastic. Well, they've got it on DS. They have it now, but I mean, like, the old one. But Final Fantasy 6, I think, for storytelling, for just how drawn in it brings you into everything, for all the detail, and I mean, flushing toilets, a first for any Final Fantasy game. I mean, but with the opera, by the time you get to the opera, there's like this epic, crazy stuff, and so much has gone on already, and you just, you're like, oh my god, this is some crazy adventure. Plus, it's all about the X-Zone. And the Vanish Doom. No, it was... X-Zone was the one I used, but it was all about that. Alright, we're gonna wrap up, or we're gonna have no time for Skype calls in Part B. We're gonna move on and take a break, but hey, don't go away. There'll be plenty more of Orange Launch Radio. Some more news coming in Part B. We've got a new technology Microsoft might be building so that people will stop swearing on Xbox Live. I can't wait to see what people have to say about this. Yeah, I know. Aw, fuck. Alright. So anyway, we'll be talking about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio. And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we have, for tonight's free break, your shout outs from our voicemail. So enjoy. We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Music Music Hey all our crew, happy 300k. Here's the turnaround of all our legendary DSX-B8. Yes, this voicemail is about the value of the all our tech, or the never-ending trans class in DMN case. Hey, hey, hey! What's up? Dan Chateau here. So, 300. Episode 300. Wow. 300. Really? I can't even get one. Can't get one? Just one. Really? No. 300. Wow, man. Cool. Yeah. 300. Sure. Okay. Bye. Okay. Hi, it's Goldampero. I haven't really left a message to talk to you guys for a while, but I'm, and even though I'm probably going to be there, I'm probably not going to be there just because of the stupid school reasons. So, hope you guys, your 300 episode is really good and I'll send it on the podcast. Anyway, real quickly, I want to tell my game spot so I can stop the story. Basically, there's one for the whiteboard. I went once with my mom a couple months ago, and what happened was, well, I got sent. We were waiting in line, and the lady was, we had to wait 10 minutes, they were ignoring us, and we were at the front of the line at the counter, and then they had the nerve to ask, the nerve to ask, do you want to buy an edge cart with that, because you're 10% discount? My mom was like, no, and then we walked out. I mean, after making us wait 10 minutes, we could tell they were pretty much a little bit ignoring us, and you know, I know it's a bit busy, but I mean, it's just so annoying. So there's one for the game spot, stop, whatever message board thing. Sorry it was a little over a minute. Later. What's up, Orange Mouse Radio? This is Tigerclaw. I'd like to congratulate you all for the 300th episode. Keep up the good fight. Take care. Alright? Well, happy 300th! Or as we say in French, 30, 30! Oh well, hell. Anyway, hi there, O.L.R., this is SakiRipper just calling you to say happy 300! 300 after the arms jargon. That was Swedish. So, oh well, hell. You're us at a later date.

Have a good show tonight. See you laters Welcome back everybody to episode number 300 of orange lounge radio in this Sunday evening, October the 26th 2008 just a reminder. There will be no show next week I'm just due to the fact that hey We deserve a week off after 300 episodes and the fact that I'm having surgery and I'm being held up by Loki Dressed as sack boy, which you can see on our Justin TV feed at Justin TV slash orange lounge radio Right now he's holding up tipped gunny. Oh, he's holding up the Justin listeners with a gun. That's that's lovely. Where'd you get a gun? Okay, I'm like where the hell who got you a gun Rob I have airsoft guns, all right Pistols, all right Anyhow, I know we want to get to the skype line. We got a lot of people want to call in tonight We're gonna try as many calls as possible But first we got a little more news to get to and Loki you ready and situated there ready to get us back into some Gaming news. Yeah, of course. All righty. All right, so Starting things off as I kind of hinted to earlier pin aircade adventures episode 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PC on October 29th That's awesome news. No word on ps3 yet Probably just because they just finally got the first episode so give it a little bit more time but it will be $15 on both platforms and Will be all sorts of awesome. So sweet. It better be based on that recommendation Well, it's supposed to be the first one was kind of fun. So we don't see why the second one would be as well Well one thing you might not be getting to do when you play this game online Even though you don't really play this game online, but other Xbox Live games would be you probably won't get to swear much longer Apparently the US patent office has granted a patent to Microsoft for real-time censoring of audio streams So, you know, this is pretty self-explanatory Probably what Microsoft wants as far as they want to be able to censor what Xbox Live is probably most known for Is the fuck fuck fuck fuck, you know and all that stuff that you hear when you go on Xbox Live, by the way They can't censor this show. Haha Fuck fuck fuck fuck You know what though You know what a writer on Ars Technica though Jonathan Gitlin though Brings up a really kind of scary point think about this because you know, this is the technology, right? I can also envisage a much sinister role However, imagine the same system applied to digital telephony then think how valuable such a system might be to an authoritarian authoritarian regime As we've seen to good effect in Burma and elsewhere the ubiquity of cell phones It's been a good thing for dissidents who need to get their message out or organize themselves The Great Firewall of China already blocks objectionable web content from reaching Chinese computers What's to stop cell phones from censoring anti-government conversations, too? That is kind of a scary thought Let's hope that this isn't used for you know, anything Pushing the limits I can imagine this is Gonna be a scary thing if it falls into the wrong hands. So Janai brings up an interesting point What's that in chat? Imagine censoring the angry video game nerd? Well, yeah still just anything it's a it kind of threatens free speech. His powers are beyond Microsoft's comprehension If indeed if in the wrong hands, I you know again in this country, you know, since free speech is in our Constitution I don't think it's gonna be a big problem. But you know, it could be interesting to see the effect This could have another place. I think the guy makes a good point What if it falls in the wrong hands, but also I can't imagine that this is going to be That accurate, you know what I mean? That'd be ways. Will it catch me if I say frack? The thing is with what if I'm talking about my shih tzu dog, am I gonna get censored thing is Rob about free speech rights Yeah, the government can't inhibit your free speech rights But companies sure can when you agree to play by their rules exactly as long as you've signed the agreement saying that you're going to use their proprietary, you know Software and I guess the hardware to since it's referring to the Xbox Then they do have a right to censor any content that comes through their own equipment it's just like a private Organization denying people the use of their facilities exactly. All right, I get that I get that but still I'm gonna be very disappointed Since I pay for Microsoft service if I can't say fuck However, knowing Microsoft and based on track history only I'm going to assume it'll probably be a switch little You know help keep it safe for kids, which I'm cool with, you know If parents want to turn it on but they shouldn't rely on it. That's the other dangerous thing I don't want parents to rely on it to see it like, you know, some of those TBS comedies where they replace it with like Stupid words just like ordinary thing like what a fruit French toast Shove it up your bologna. Yes, like Well or kazoo or be perfectly honest the whole reason that swear words are considered swear words in the beginning is Because people have given them the power to offend and what is it that I have been saying? For a very long time now you find this show very offensive Oh, whatever learn to be offended the less of a big deal you make out of it The less it's gonna matter. I mean really The whole reason that I think you know little kids think it's fun to go out and cuss from their little kids is because their Parents say oh, that's bad. You shouldn't do it the less you're allowed to do something the more y'all want to do it Exactly it people do that because people do that because it raises eyebrows Well, look folks No one gets offended. Why would they want to do it anymore? I would love to see Microsoft's and giggles Well, that's why I would love to see Microsoft just try and censor this next segment of ours The FUs of the week Fuck you with something hard and sandpaper II to a certain closed-minded tight-assed bigoted conservatives that have been Less than polite in regards to how they decide to phrase their personal points of view and F you to other things that are personal. All right Oh go and F you to my hair Loki F you the sack boy for being so fluffy cuz Fluffy equals hot you're kind of you're kind of fluffy Loki. I am couple that's why I didn't have to pad the front Yeah, no needing the pad myself. Well that and it's really friggin hot But actually luckily the sweatshirt is quite thin so it's not too bad I actually have like jeans under the pants and another t-shirt under this shirt so All right, but the heads really fucking hot can't can't do anything with the head my turn Yes, yay. I want to say F you to the people that decided to call me faggot yesterday Well, I was out protesting prop 8 we were out there on the streets holding signs You know, I had a big thing said, you know protect civil rights and all stuff there was a group of us out there and some guy as he drove by decided to yell faggots and throw candy corn at us cuz That's that's the world. We live in folks. No, I don't know whether to be angry or happy that no It's like it's like and one hand I'm offended by what you said in the other hand candy corn Not when they've fallen on the dirty-ass Street. I'm not oh, that's just not except that is I guess So not only did he say faggot Loki. He wasted candy corn and if you don't know You don't waste time. I'm sorry Is is it wrong for me to mention that we're supposed to learn to stop throwing things and having food fight Yeah, when we're in kindergarten Yeah, and then oh, yeah, and then the lady as she was coming out of the drive-thru No, here's the best one the lady coming out the drive-thru faggots. You're all going to hell That's what she yelled at us. They should have thrown skittles. No, you know what I said, I yelled back I said God loves a bigot too. That's what I said back to her. Then she drove off pissed off good. So You know and so don't sit there and tell me this proposition isn't about hate and discrimination Cuz I'll tell you what I've seen it right in the face and it is so yeah. All right Moving on some real quick F use from our guests because we have a lot in studio We'll start with Drew since he has a mic. All right F you to my student government for being assholes about the whole proposition thing agreed, I didn't vote him in and They're trying to speak for the entire student body and I don't like it one bit actually I did to go with this I might have mentioned this earlier. There was a girl who was driving in front of me leaving school We forget the same school and she wrote on her car. No to prop eight. The ARC Student Council does not represent me. I approve of that but Also F you to people who are taking the zombie event in while a little too far and taking the hordes and hordes of zombies People taking Wow too far to the low B zones and killing all the low B's are trying to start out That's not cool. I mean, yeah, it's zombies and it's brains, but it's not cool. Don't be a dick All right, pick up boy. Do you have any F use of the week? I'm gonna send a nephew toward the bimbo of politicians everywhere and I don't even think I need to you know, Go any further with that because everybody should know who I'm talking about But so I shall pass the mic on Arcadian 42 fuck you to 65-hour work weeks. They suck put me behind like Way way behind on everything. But oh well give me money Good money is good. Doctor. Fuck you to expert on DDR because I look like a douche trying to do it nice And lastly Mel Chan anything you want to say free no fuck use for Mel Chan. All right All right, that's it for the F use of the week dark Sakura take us back to some gaming news and stuff happened the end Okay, it'd be soft as actually working on the latest I know game and Actually have had to push it back a little bit As well as one that they have literally called an as yet unannounced Franchise they were gonna release it to the 2008-2009 Fiscal year, but it's actually going to be oh nine ten. We don't know what this is. But I know I'm 1404 is a settlement building game This speaks for itself There's there's a trailer around if someone wants to look at game trailers. I'm sure there's one there But the other one they're not saying what it is, but they said that it's an unannounced one. So Maybe it's a brand new franchise could be Hmm well Something unfortunately hasn't been delayed is an update to the Wii firmware. That's now disabling the homebrew channel from being installed other possible problems faced with that are some homebrew programs not running also the video player that they had that also allowed you to watch DVDs is not working as well the end player and Right now though if you do have the homebrew channel installed you're fine, but you won't be able to install it if you You know do 3.3 also in Japan They have the shop channel down right now for maintenance as they're changing all the references to Wii points to Nintendo points and other Pre-dsi maintenance is that a little deceiving though because the points aren't going to be interchangeable that strikes me as kind of dumb it is deceiving yes And then also apparently right now If you don't update your system you will not be able to access the shop channel Which is ironic because if you think about it if they're not able to access the shop channel They won't buy your crap that you're selling online And you know with the homebrew stuff that it is easy to I don't know Pirate said games that you're offering on the service I would think that you would want to allow people to be able to purchase your games and let them have fun with the homebrew stuff since likely Situation is is that they're actually not pirating games using that they're just you know playing with these home brew people jobs I Don't think they need jobs. It's just if there's something offered to them for free They're gonna take the free route then rather than pay for a game that might be crap and unfortunately There's a lot of might be crap games on the Wii Um kloutipo in chat says so do the people who have to try and close all these homebrew exploits Just completely and utterly hate their jobs. I see so no way someone could take pleasure from that well I I can see the other side though. You know people stealing other people's work by pirating such games Don't lie. This is what a lot of the quote-unquote homebrew people do I can see both sides of it, though? All right well um I guess maybe I should hurry up and install that before my Wii updates itself because I haven't updated it yet So maybe I should get that homebrew channel on there I don't know is it is it gonna screw me over later if I put it on there now no you can always delete it It's not like you're gonna buy anything on the Wii shop channel Rob. Well. I don't know this this might do the trick It's something new that was announced this week. It's Mart racer. Do you remember the old-school game show supermarket sweep? Dude, that's this the greatest ever that's this look. There's a little trailer here. We're playing in studio It's yeah Lifetime lawnmowers unpacked, but look at this you actually run around a supermarket with your cart And you but you pick up plungers for some weird reason, but if you run into other shoppers But yeah like it's everything you've always wanted to do in the supermarket They're all kind of crazy out of eight characters, so there you have it. It's like it's gonna rock suit meets Jet-set radio or something like that by the way according to Juan grill who is the studio manager for the developers Joju games? He says that Mart racer was inspired from the shape of the wiimote He says quote the first time I grabbed a wiimote instinctively I grabbed it with both hands like a bar that made me start thinking on a game where you can maneuver it like you would Be grabbing a So that is how we came to the game as a Mat would be grabbing a bar so there you go and if you want to play with a classic controller you can but I guess it's probably more fun with motion controls because you can imagine that you're pushing that cart just like a bat out of hell up and down the aisles of Safeway it'll be lots of fun you know I wonder because people are always afraid about you know real life taking after video games I wonder if this is gonna cause an epidemic of like you know people running around supermarkets like crazy let's go on a milkshake run as if this milkshake as if this game get more stuff for milkshakes as if this game will sell that many copies although I don't know it sounds pretty awesome to me I might actually I might break my protest just for Mart racer because it looks that awesome anyhow what are some other things you can download our sagra well there is a few games coming out on we were in the UK there are there's the incredible maze which is a 500 we points and it's different it's mazes and has balance board support so you actually steer a ball around the maze and dodge traps basically it's marble madness with the balance board from what I understand there's also interior design and well an interior design game sorry called home sweet home that is you basically take rooms and redesign them sort of like a bizarre puzzle and it's a thousand we points and then there's Tetris party which is 1200 we points that is minigame Tetris using the balance board and it has online multiplayer for up to six people yeah but how many times have I played Tetris really what just remember the epic battle with Christopher thank you kept yelling at us again for Tetris on the DS Oh God he was a scary motherfucker on Tetris on the DS I remember that that was some scary stuff yeah thanks for the memories alright anyhow I'm sorry yes so other than stuff coming on to the WiiWare service there's some interesting stuff if you happen to own a Super Nintendo system apparently a German programmer took upon himself to create a new console game that supports eight players his creation is a brawler called n warp die sukent or it looks like a yeah die sakusen and allows you to plug in two multi taps in the one and our SNES and yeah it's pretty awesome but you can also if you don't want to I don't know say find a cart for it since it doesn't look like there is an actual cart you can play it through an emulator but I don't know that's pretty awesome eight player brawler game for Super Nintendo if you want to download it the website is gra dot d force three thousand dot de so that's where you can get that wonderful game all right well for those of you looking forward to new Nintendo products Animal Crossing city focus coming out pretty soon and a bunch of videos have been kind of shown up around the internet and it's revealed a lot more about the game a lot more details about the

village you get clovers brought over the DS version of all of the objects like fossils tools and accessories show up as 3d objects the villages are gonna go back to having two different elevation

show up in the city there's more grass in your city than dirt unlike the DS version nooks cranny and nook and go are back as nook upgrades in the game there's gonna be a Tom Nook apron shirt skunk is

doctor horrible costume everywhere is sold out of most everything I need that said I'm going to be the flash for Halloween anyways which one game are you all looking forward to this gaming season once fallout 3 comes out I'm gonna hibernate peace I don't know I've already gotten most of the games I'm looking forward to I guess the only thing I've left is resistance to resistance to is a good one now do you have anyone you're looking for do anyone else left for dead yeah I want zombie action to speak into the microphone which one wait what I miss last remnant what game are you looking forward to that hasn't come out yet that you don't already have a little big planet yeah fallout 3 hopefully this week yeah I want to play a lot of little big planet while I'm recovering from surgery that's the plan it'll be fun to play while you're on drugs yes that's I'm sorry I'm also looking forward to last remnant though even though I was not a fan of infinite undiscovery I thought that I thought that it does the beginning was awful like it didn't want me I didn't want to play it past the first hour in comparison to blue dragon even blue dragon I played for at least like the first disc but the best was lost Odyssey by waste of time I swear lost us he was the best by far that's that's it for email though all right mailbag orange launch radio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week meanwhile more news Loki yes anyways so of course we know about the new game coming out halo recon or halo 3 recon apparently though bungees halo team is moving on to other things once this is done so I don't know maybe another game from bungee that's say not halo maybe a I don't know marathon game something like that a low may low marathon oh haven't they said this before like oh we swear we're not doing this before like after halo 3 but you know it says basically they were saying that they want to work on different territory and they said but I think when this project wraps up in a couple months that it will be time for when the team moves on to something else and part of the team will move on something else and part of them will probably be absorbed into one of the other projects that are already on the way I like what a deep man suggests in the chat room a game called j-lo get it tips it say you know we need forget it hey you know how the PlayStation 3 has trophies well according to the u.s. official PlayStation magazine Sony might actually be giving out more than just trophies pretty soon it's a little quote from the magazine that people were reading way too much into it says quote we've heard that SCA is mulling over some sort of trophy reward system we doubt it'll be cash to the equivalent but we suspect it might be exclusive access to early betas and the like so you know trophies are like PlayStation 3's version of 360s achievements wouldn't that be interesting if suddenly you could use your trophies to now get into betas and stuff I think Microsoft should do the same thing because I play a lot more Microsoft games and well you know and and I agree with the people that wrote this story on the net I got no problem if it's early demos or what have you but just to give exclusive that seems kind of wrong to me just encourages people to do nothing but play games all day but then again this whole thing whole world is something retarded what is your what here's the words doing you know where for example if you have different achievements and Gears of War that you get shit for Gears of War 2 could it be something like that that makes you know I beat you know a little big planet when little big planet 2 comes out or something like that I get some stupid costume or something that works that works yeah all right well we'll see what happens maybe more to come from Sony probably in 2009 I doubt that Sony's gonna explode the end it already exploded it puked out something called Star Wars galaxies black wolf has a good point I got to read this in chat okay sky what's better giving exclusive betas to people who have lots of trophies or giving exclusive betas to people who buy core I'll take option three giving exclusive betas to me here that's the best of me anyway in other words the fanboys will never be happy well there is a a boy named Brandon crisp 50 15 years old who went missing after his parents confiscated his Xbox there is a Microsoft Canada is adding $25,000 to the reward information that will you know hopefully lead to his safe return so they're basically doubling the amount that's already out they're working with the Barrie Ontario authorities looking for IP addresses of anyone who had come into contact with him through Call of Duty 4 which was his favorite game and Microsoft is really really putting forward a lot of effort into trying to get this kid back so basically the oh god I hate this person how is it Microsoft's problem he who shall not be named has involved himself what the fuck I thought he was gone let me finish making an offer to the to help the cops try to find it and and making up some crap about a video game addiction or whatever the fuck he's on I'm so disgusted with him what the fuck so now they got this bar he's gonna what go become a Canadian lawyer or something is that what he's trying to do god damn it the people that are supposed to threaten to move to Canada are the Liberals that are afraid that you know it's like push gets reelected just I just go play hide and go fuck yourself already you're already so this party can't read Shakespeare go get out of here I'm just completely disgusted I can't even call him a human being anymore really it's he's just a part I think he's a part at any rate for anyone who might have some information on his whereabouts call the Berry police at seven oh five seven two five seven zero two five I hope that someone can find this kid I just hope that you know he's okay so stop being an asshole and get out there and look someone needs to find it before Jack does oh my god because if he finds him we'll never hear the end of it Wow look at all the good I do I'm just disgusted I really am horrified you know who does he think he is he's I mean he seriously is called cause so much harm to so many people and he can't stop he's already being punished for it and asshole hasn't learned his lesson yet I mean seriously the only thing that's gonna stop this guy is to lock him up in a padded room and have him yell his insults to the wall that does not care the end let's just hope the wall doesn't have a blog the wall fucking bitch laps him okay I'm a wall and even I hate you all right more news we're gonna open up the skype line very soon at one eight seven seven game ol are all right well a legendary pictures the

Fighter 4 it's coming out this winter for sure says Capcom now keep in mind that Loki's them you know next year got a good idea when this game is coming out well the rumors have all been now that I mean originally it was supposed to like January since I've been now they're trying to time it with the release of the movie so probably around the time that the crappy movie comes out so yeah winner does not mean necessarily this year winner is also January in February winner December through February now the movie itself is being released in that time period where all the stinker movies are released which is like a couple weeks after Valentine's Day but kind of far away from Memorial Day yeah February 27th is when the Street Fighter movie is supposed to come out so they assume that Street Fighter 4 will come out around that same time so the two can benefit each other so one more than the other we'll see what happens what do you think is gonna make more money the movie or the

little behind so make sure you have the most current episode oh I don't walk us I'm not down in the podcast oh well you I think it got mentioned but anyway okay so I haven't played it yet I want to what do you think of the game it's it's like the other DS Castlevania is more or less well I like those like how they have like a lot of new areas now it's like one big area how does it compare to previous Castlevania games like well like the maps for example they're smaller now but there's like there's like more enemies so it's more difficult and like you'll usually be so busy funny anyways that you'll hardly notice that the amount of small especially cuz like for this game I don't use I hardly use the map like I usually have the second screen for like checking enemies and stuff hmm do we have any really bad beat movie dialogue in the game um yeah the English voice acting kind of sucks and there's a Japanese language option but for me doesn't make it any better always make it into a language that I'm not very fluent in yet hmm all right well do you recommend it to fans of Castlevania yeah I've been that doesn't sound like a very solid yes kind of like a yeah I guess I mean you have nothing better to do I guess you could do it and if it if you're looking for a game that's like more action oriented and like exploration oriented and this is a pretty good game to try out all

else you want to share with us tonight besides drinking live on air kicked up rock band 2 and it's our hero world tour who at the same time yes and which one's better the jury is still out I will say this much when it comes to Bon Jovi living on a prayer guitar hero world tour is a lot better do but here's the thing though here's the thing though um the guitar hero world tour actually made Bobby say fuck on his show so I mean that makes me really worried like not even rock revolution did that well we're gonna get rock revolution soon but we're gonna probably wait till use copy pops up did you notice that rock revolution has like a real like basement metacritic score it's it's kind of sad it was getting like threes it's crap yeah it's it's disturbing I still want to get it because I'm sick but I'm waiting for it to go on clearance because you know it's just a matter of time saying yeah I'll definitely yo Rama wave clear yo drink for the guests dude we deserve I'm not getting I'm not getting up out of my seat right now if I get up I'm going into living to play some more rock band okay someone send someone to get you the drinks all right everybody else is asleep why don't you go to liquor so I get some drinks true you do that I will matter of fact there's five guests here so you better start okay I tell you what Joe Diaz in the chat room drinking right now so she'll drink a shop each of the guests in the chat and me in the studio all right there you go yeah all right Rama I'll let you go for more calls have a going buddy yeah later 300 later hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello there orange lounge this is a character hello my friend how are you I'm doing just fine I'm well what I call well I was quite surprised that at last the downloadable pack this week for rock band in in the sense that it was a few sushi and banshee songs we're really the we're really like my we my best best news of the week actually yes I know I'm very excited about that just it's nice to see a nice eclectic mix of music and rock band my problem is though that that all of the three songs that are there that are there only one of them is good actually yeah they are to be picky there's no peek-a-boo or anything which would be rad but I can't imagine actually playing that song in rock band that's the thing yeah well babe but that and that you mentioning peek-a-boo is like in one way if you know if you know the history behind that song you know that it will be quite hard in one way since the whole song is played backwards so it's right since they have to learn how to play it all back what would be a fun challenge mode though there's notes can scroll the opposite way well it'll be fun yeah what else is going on your gaming world this week not much actually not much at all I'm it's a bit it's really a sad thing in one way since well I bought Warhammer online so when it came out and well I have it I have played it like the number of times I have actually played it I can count it on one hand Wow me too I'm in the exact same boat you are and and then and then I started thinking in one way actually since since I was it was a I check actually I didn't check out Wow went back to Wow actually but I did see the new logins frequents the login login screen and that actually made me go we who big frost worm yeah it's got mushroomed well we just had a flying mushroom behave boys and girls in studio sorry our guests are getting unruly all right sorry ahem we're a little distracted here people are throwing things each other's studio yes go ahead well other than that well I'm sorry I'm starting to get sort of in one way pissed also since at the current state I have no TV whatsoever oh my god which yeah yeah but then again but but and that's starting to annoy me really since I want to play on my retro cut I want to I'm sort of almost really utterly want to play so play on my player placed or play on my ps1 so since I haven't played on that one for a long time and well I would have I want to play front vision 3 I yeah I you know you could do that whole thing where you download things to the PSP but I don't know if they have that game on there I don't have a PSP yeah that's the thing and and we're and with the thing that the three mo three has come out and with the problem that that's causing I'm sort of like now just wait really I'll just wait as usual so well I hear it for we got to uh we got to let you go to get some more calls but I on my short man I'm sure knows anyone way plus anyone way I thought of when I was starting to go over and it was a weird Skype just crashed on us in the middle of that call that's why you heard the remix that was strange I swear I didn't do anything to provoke that okay yeah if something else is on the line I'll go to voicemail right away so we're gonna sign back yes sorry to aka Ripper who got cut off I was weird I was very weird but well I guess we're open for business again 1 877 game olr what what right rice princess to send me a text and she says lovely thank you all right hey we have another call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hi kitsune what's on your mind oh well thank you very much would it you would be are you calling us from inside your own Sackboy outfit you sound very distance oh wow so I guess maybe that might be we chat on the I am sometimes all right on right on well what's been going on in your gaming world this week well the other week I went to Tokyo game show which was really exciting tell us about that how was Tokyo game show what kind of stuff did you see there oh it was huge very exciting tons of people the biggest booth is probably Xbox 360 do you think Xbox 360 is going to turn around in Japan I believe so I mean they had a pretty big booth and tons of people waiting in line they had 105 minute wait for one game Wow what game was that I think it was the last remnant mmm I'm kind of not surprised at that yeah because that would be the game that is supposed to like kind of cater to the Japanese audience wow that's why e3 can't go public you guys 105 minute waits just to play like one RPG imagine what those Wii U lines would have looked like if it was open to the public of the nut so anyway Wow well I'm glad I'm glad you're having a good time I want to talk about called time hollow okay and it is a Japanese game but it was just released in the States and it is amazing if you ever heard of shadow of destiny's for the PlayStation 1 it's much like that game in which you have to change the past and then it causes something else to change which you got to go back and change again and it has real anime videos throughout the whole game I loved it so it sounds kind of like a puzzle game but with anime cutscenes not a puzzle game it's an adventure game interesting oh Mel chance Mel chance calling it butterfly effect the game yes okay that's kind of cool okay all right I might have to check that out you know there's a lot of these games that really don't show up on the radar like that that I wish would get more coverage so I know to look out for them yeah I was drooling over it for a while in the Japanese stores here Toys R Us and different local stores and then all of a sudden I see it at the store on base I'm like grab there you go all right well kitsune do you have any any other thoughts for our listeners tonight before we let you go thank you very much I'll check out time hollow for sure you take care bye-bye all right I like getting phone calls from far far far away all right if you want to give us a call one eight seven seven game olr username on skype is orange lunch radio hi you're on orange launch radio who's this oh it's a line and mr. finally got her 360 this week wait who's this misty hey misty wait misty did you say you finally actually got a 360 this week yeah finally Wow welcome to the collective congrats are you on Xbox Live and all that good stuff yet oh yeah I'm like right in my account since the day I got the system you're gonna have to send me a message with your gamertag now I keep my haven't been on Xbox Live in like a week so if you already did I just haven't gotten it yet but you have to send me a message it's it's the same gamertag from last time my elderly name so you're already on my way oh okay that's right that's right that's right okay I forgot you had the old Xbox it's just that I hardly ever saw you on there okay well cool well what what games did you get for 360 main one was portal still alive I caved and downloaded beaten groovy for the fuck of it I know it there's something about being a bimani fan at heart where you have to give beaten groovy a try it's like rock revolution like that's why I keep saying like God I really want to get rock revolution just because I feel like I know it's really not worth it I know I know I have not downloaded beaten groovy if you play that game you're just encouraging them make crap I know I know same with beaten groovy it's like seriously what have they I mean what was so what the fuck it does have a couple good songs in it but it the price tag sucks the price tag sucks it only has a couple songs in it all right gs68 says is it even worse than worse than Yaris I would actually say no beaten groovy at least has star mine and shit it's not worse than yours but it's better than crisis shut up all right any games coming out for 360 that you're looking forward to misty I admit I haven't been paying too much I've been too busy with the stuff I have got well you need to pay more attention to our show young lady I'm just kidding it's cool it's all good oh come on you have a city attention span so any chance of a misty visit in the future I'm working on it I wasn't feeling good before that dentist appointment I had the other day so I had to postpone it a pay period so yeah well I still want to I just don't know when at least there's always Xbox Live to connect us in the meantime all right missy any other quick thoughts before we let you go I'm not really all right we'll have a going missy enjoy the new 360 thanks bye I'll do one more call here on orange launch radio tonight one eight seven seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hey this is Bobby I'm from a far-off place called Atlanta hi far-off place call I don't I don't know if I've ever heard of Atlanta no hey Bobby I'm glad you called in cuz worst Airport ever we're always calling in your show in a way but no no no Philadelphia is the worst area yeah let's oh no Dallas is cake y'all are done y'all have never been to Philly compared to Atlanta's Airport sorry Dallas is Chicago sucks anyway sorry Bobby you always let us call into your show but we're never you're never on ours what's on your mind Bobby well no I was just coming it calling in to congratulate you on 300 and you know kind of a question for you guys about your show well thank you where do you see you yourself at episode 400 canceled no I somebody had to say it where do we see ourselves at episode 400 um good question I'll let Loki start probably not much different than it is now I mean as the show fundamentally changed that much as one well I guess in a way yes it has only talking like two years I mean seriously I mean it's since episode one we did change from a you know show about DDR that was very random sometimes I mean my god we're talking about the next systems I think honestly in two years it'll be kind of about the next round of systems I think we'll try to do our best to maintain to stay on the cutting edge of interactive tools I think you will see Orange Launch Radio getting into video more in two years not necessarily that we're gonna be hell we will not in the way you think like not necessarily it'll be our mugs reading the news like it'll be fairies but maybe kind of the shut up maybe the way like folks interact with us I think will be different I I just you know cuz you know we were one of the first shows to really jump on skype when that first came out and you know just in TV we weren't really the first but you know that was a way to kind of expand through that and you know we like to try to stay on the cutting edge of how to stay interactive with the listeners so you know I it's it's hard to think of what hasn't been done yet I don't know does that Sackboy costume have like fur on it does that gun is a furry for you no it's not it's I don't know what is it's stuff it's like sweatshirt material it's like a giant sweatshirt is what it is it's not furry though so and no tingle hat on it no table at this time but we figured this is the closest the listeners are ever gonna get to seeing Loki in a tingle outfit so you gotta you gotta take take what you can no because from what I can understand Loki likes Sackboy so it's not as fun to see him dressed up as that is it would be to see him dressed up as tingle but it's still adorable well I can't help it someone hasn't sold another 800,000 copies of something you know we're working on it well we're friends forever we're putting billboards up for it so and we're given I'm sorry I have I have a PlayStation 3 now so I can add Loki to my friends list so you don't have to be Loki's only friend anymore but I have more than one friend now you know yeah he dumped me as his only friend oh there are some other people that actually had a little bit planned already they were playing it not that I could play at them because the servers aren't up yet till tomorrow they're gonna be up tomorrow fuck yeah so yeah can't wait so hey Bobby now that you're on the r-rated show is there anything you want to say about guitar hero world tour you didn't get to say on your show well I see yeah when you added that I didn't get to say on my show that kind of cut it out oh yeah the drums fucking suck and maybe next time Activision really should kind of look at their own equipment before they badmouth the other ones and say hey when dearest breaks you can come by ours cuz it won't break yeah I got I got a break because it's already broken have you thought about checking out rock revolutions drum set just to see if it's better well I don't think it's out yet actually oh my gosh even though the game's out the game is out the drum sets not out until November because apparently they haven't quite figured out the manufacturing of that either and I've played on the drum kit and a couple times but no the actual drum sets not in stores yet it's just the game what I want to know is the drums weren't I mean I don't think I didn't get to play it but it didn't seem that the drums were broken when they were showing it off what happened I mean seriously mass production I guess yeah you know when they're take you know taking stuff like that to a convention they a test it and make sure they only bring the units that work and you know B when a unit breaks they have a replacement or they just closed down that station I remember when rock band was first shown at the packs that you guys weren't at the year before they started out with like three drum sets and they had one by the end of the year by the end of the weekend and you could actually see the other drum sets all like bandaged up in the corner of the booth it was the sad depressed broken machines and I had Dan Teasdale on on I was doing an interview with him for my show from the booth and I asked him about you know the durability of the drum sets and while I was asking the question I looked at the pile of depressed drum sets and he didn't take the bait interesting well it is amazing how those guys talk sometimes they surprised another review so far of said anything about the drum sets breaking I don't mean there is a thread on Kotaku and stuff that they're talking about like a game facts forum thread or something like that that people were saying hey you know we're posted for your drum sets work or not and there's people having problems with guitars having problems with the drum sets I mean just a lot of them I have not seen a single post from anybody that says my drums work perfectly that's not to say that there's none that aren't effective but I just either they're too busy playing the game or they just don't post on forums or whatever everybody has some sort of problem with the drums Wow well I mean yeah I guess it's a good thing I don't buy these games for the drum parts because I'm just not good at drum so I always buy them for guitars but still you know if I ever was interested in doing it someday that's kind of depressing I don't know yeah and I mean I guess now I've got to do the whole RMA process but I'm kind of worried you know have they fixed it yet because some of these threads you know I've looked on the official guitar hero forums which I know are mostly negative because the people only post there when they're pissed or can't play true but they've said you know one guy said I've returned it three times my store has no more every single drum set that I've gotten from the store has a different pad that's broken dang like they can't get one that has all five pads that work maybe they rushed it maybe they just rushed it I think that's really what it is they just didn't take the time to get it right and you want to know what's funny is if you go to Activision's now this is something I didn't say on my show if you go to Activision's support site and you look at the question you know why are my pads not working one of the things that actually says is you may need to hit it harder or softer these drums react differently than other drum games you may have played so they kind of insinuate that it's harmonics is fault that you're trying to play guitar hero in a specific way in a way that works huh because it's weird because ordinary drums they just seem to make noise whenever I hit them yeah you know Bobby and it's just it's kind of funny coming from you because I know you're essentially a professional drummer and you know it's just kind of funny that she a professional drummer isn't playing the drums right apparently yeah and I mean it's you have to smack it really hard for it to register and they say well you may need to hit a pad harder or you may need to hit them softer and I'm like not in that sense you shouldn't have to hit the right pad three times as hard as the middle pad and stuff and I mean I I even plugged in my professional drum kit which I've been passing around photos and oh man that little bit of problem on you have to post that photo in chat because it's hilarious seeing all your equipment just like practically on top of each other I want to ask you though real quick um what about the guitar with the game because for those of us that aren't so much into drums or guitars have you have you played around with that at all I play around a little bit with the guitar and I am happy to report that my guitar looks like it has absolutely no problem now that being said I don't really understand the point of that slider thing the tutorial shows you how to use it and it doesn't work all the time but I think it's because I'm doing it wrong not because the hardware sucks but it's kind of like the lower fret notes in in rock band I'll never use it yeah you know that there's things that you can do with it now one of the things is that is your wah wah so instead of using the whammy bar for for things that maybe you don't have star power you can actually run your hand along that and it does the wah wah thing which is kind of cool and I know weird times just for the novelty factor huh but the guitar feels fine and they actually did add one of the one of the actual software things for people that didn't buy the guitar that they added to get world tour is that now you can have like one note held down and then you can strum down a second note and a third note so they'll do chords that kind of come on like that they're not hammer-ons but you still have to keep one note held down while you bring the second one in interesting huh well I'm still using a guitar hero to explore in all my games that's the only controller I have so it's time for me to get a new one so be interesting and other than that you know people are asking how's the actual game I've been spending most of the day trying to get the game to work so I haven't really gotten too far name although I will say that apparently the storyline behind the game according to the intro screen is Kenny G comes out and hypnotizes everybody and it's your job to un-hypnotize everybody wow that's such a guitar hero story I hope that's fake I mean cuz that's oh that's the opening cinematic is yet like a guy with a clarinet comes out and hypnotizes the entire crowd and so the gh symbol flashes on everybody's cell phone and watch and stuff and they all converge well un-hypnotize the crowd well aren't they gonna feel stupid when they release clarinet hero later on all right Bobby we gotta let you go so we can wrap our show do you have any last thoughts um fuck you people who brag about your hardware that doesn't work all right take care of Bobby and bang guys we wouldn't get here we wouldn't gotten here without you Bobby so thank you thank take care I'll make you I'll make you late in two weeks all right bye all right that's gonna do it for Skype tonight I know lots of people want to get through the could or wanted to get through that couldn't sorry about that but we do want to get back to our lives and and produce episode 301 for you in a couple weeks quickly though some last-minute stories I want to start actually no I'll come to you last drew as a story he wants to we'll come to him last Loki do you have any last minute actually dark Sakura anything no Loki then I just real quick there was a little big planet download that was added into for Japan you know that game ape escape well now you can download a costume for your sack boy that's actually the ape in the game which is kind of funny also army of two is supposed to be getting a movie as well you know it's funny we hear a lot of these movies that are coming out but none of them come out except for like math max Payne I guess they're all next year it's all talk until it actually happens all right so that's it I guess for last minute stories are at one other quick little dedication here drunami wants to do and then we're gonna go around and get final thoughts tonight a little bit of sad news for the wild players that remember the forums remember Ezra Chatterton he was contacted by the make-a-wish foundation because he had a brain tumor and talked to Blizzard and had some things customized for him had a few weapons dedicated to him had an entire tire few characters and quest lines in his honor passed away on Monday October 20th from a stroke and our thoughts are with them well that's very unfortunate and you know I know there was a lot of people that actually went in and did the will you find my dog quest that day just kind of like to because that was his quest and his voice is still in the game so it's very interesting that you know despite you know what's happened in offline he kind of will continue to live on online which is really neat which is something only a video game could do so I know that is a very sad note to end episode 300 with so can somebody make a fart joke or something to bring us back Rob what dongle princess thank you well hey we still have the final thoughts and here wait here this always makes everything better guys if you're feeling feeling a little down here I know how to make everything better I mean hold on this always makes everything better all right now they're all in a better mood let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts we'll start with the guests tonight and Mel Chan thank you so much for being here tonight and I hope you're having fun with the DS and everything I had a lot of fun here all right come back again well we'll still be here we're not ending it tonight where's the microphone over on this side man Arcadia 42 thank you for being here of old-school blast from the past yeah it's gonna be back now that you know where the studio is feel free to come back sometime sure all right just make sure there's a show first cuz I've had that happen where we cancel the show for a night and someone showed up anyway poor guy um the doctor do you have anything you want to say yep yep yep pick up boy any final thoughts it's a coral reef crikey drew nami anything you want to leave listeners with tonight you got some red on you Loki final thought I'm gonna win my hot our costume contest at work I think good luck my final thought is since we're not doing another show before Election Day please please please vote and please please please if you're in California vote no on prop 8 and then if you do you'll never have to hear me talk about it again and I also believe you should vote no on for hell I'd give you my entire political opinions it's the one about parental notification but yeah yeah vote yes for the monorail no one damn near everything except the monorail look I honestly land even the presidential election pales in comparison to what rights are in store with prop 8 but that obviously I'm a little biased you can probably understand why anyhow dark soccer your final thought reject false icons well said all right we won't be here next week but we'll be back in two weeks wherever you guys are on Wednesday please send some happy thoughts my way I'm gonna need them and send a dollar to dark soccer because she wants them and send some copies of I have judgment to Loki because maybe you'll get an even better costume for episode 400 you never know unless you try we'll do this all again next week if you like what you heard please tell two friends about our show word of mouth is how we spread the word about our program but for now that's gonna do it leave us a nice review in iTunes or something we're out of here see you next time on orange lounge radio we'll be back in two weeks you've been listening to orange lounge radio
