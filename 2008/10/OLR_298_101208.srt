With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco UK

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, October 12, 2008, rumors about Blu-ray on 360 surface again, a next-gen Castlevania gets teased, and will YouTube soon sell you games?

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
For the next few hours, we're going to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you for the next few hours, as will the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will be not joining everybody for the next few hours.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Where are you going, young lady?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Out of body.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright, well have fun and let us know how it goes.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sure thing, Rob.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Where are you going to be visiting? Are you going to go to Disneyland and back?

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yep.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Alright, have fun. Ride Space Mountain for me.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Woohoo.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Alright, and also say hello to Tech Master, Loki, who's giggling like a schoolgirl, over here.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not giggling like a schoolgirl.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes you are. I was doing the opening and I hear, he, like, it's not your hamburger that you're eating.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, Rob, that was the people that you hear in your head.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Apparently. Okay, great, you're going out of body.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That was your voices.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have voices in my head. Loki is a schoolgirl?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Loki has a sandwich.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm watching the game, because watching, because you can't actually play the game.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't shoot the puppy.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Wait, is your mic on? You're very, very quiet tonight for some reason.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I have no on-off button.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh, there you go. Well, you just weren't talking into it right.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright, sorry, go ahead. So don't shoot the puppy?

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, don't shoot the puppy.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The puppy walks, hops across the screen very happily, but it gets slower every level.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And you just keep getting, you know, it's a test of patience.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And if you get frustrated and you push a button, it shoots the puppy with, like, this giant artillery cannon.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This sounds terrible. Wait, this is a flash game or something?

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes, it is.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And that's the whole game. You just sit there. Can I see this?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can I, can I? I know this is horrible radio, but can I?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What the hell?

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What happened? Did you shoot the puppy?

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, no, I clicked the button and it's...

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You'll just have to show me later. This is horrible radio.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's hilarious.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Apparently, Peeta has just joined our chat room and is currently protesting the show.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, there we go.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Peeta's full of shit.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, it's a cute little stick figure puppy. Okay, sister. Aww.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Does it bark and stuff?

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know. I don't know. I don't have the sound on.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is coming from a website, rrrrthats5rs.com, even though there's only four.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Grrrr.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, so shoot it.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, that's terrible! At least it's only a cartoon, it's not like the real thing.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So wait, again, the website? RRRR, that's five R's even though it's really only four.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Love that sense of humor, that's something else.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Anyhow, hey, you guys are joining us in chat.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Chat.orangelaunchy.com here live on this Sunday evening.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ew! DJ Dysentery?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, DJ Dysentery. I think DJ Dysentery's listened to the show before.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I know, but that just makes me think of Pooh.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
DJ Dysentery's in chat and says, I don't think there's sound.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So. So.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Alright, as Jamie complains about the climate in the Orange Lounge Radio Studio,

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
it was warm in here earlier and now it's really cool and off fast.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Alright, enough about the weather, let's talk about our gaming weeks.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's how we always start off the show, talking about some video games.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Dark Sakura, what have you played this week?

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I have disproven the old theory.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What theory is that?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That Airman can be defeated after all.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Because I played Mega Man 2.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Awesome.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yesterday.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Old school gaming on, right?

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sure did.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And I also have proven that I can no longer do the blindfold trick.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh, you said, what level was it you could clear blindfolded?

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Airman?

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No. No, it was the dragon.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, the wily dragon, that's right.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The wily dragon.

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mm-hmm, okay.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, GS68, you're great.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
People for the unethical shit-talking of humans.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Puesto? I've never heard of that.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Puesto.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Anyway, Puesto.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, PETA is people eating tasty animals.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright, come on, enough PETA talk.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, PETA's full of shit anyway.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, but I played some Mega Man 2 and we actually were playing through Mega Man 9.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Dan and his buddy Jeff were.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And there's some really annoying levels in that game.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
To a man's level is kind of annoying.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Is it weird to go back and visit Mega Man 2 after playing Mega Man 9?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Like, they actually have a lot in common, except 2 was a lot easier here in America.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mega Man 2 had more drops.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And if I'm correct, the difficult mode was the default mode for the Japanese version.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It sure was.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And another thing is that we were talking about the Mega Man 2 Anniversary Edition that came out on PlayStation and how it was a lot harder.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because it was based off the Japanese one, if I remember right.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, it was harder than that.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It was harder than that because we went through and played on difficult mode.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, that's so wrong.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What?

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Sorry.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't shoot the puppy.

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sorry to go back to that again.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But the game does get harder because there will be little pop-up ads that come up.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But they're all part of the game.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And if you move the mouse or anything, it shoots the puppy.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So they're like, oh, I got to click that pop-up ad.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, dead.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I love that.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I love that this show gets derailed so easily.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Go ahead.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Well, at any rate, we also tried a Proto Man mode.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And it's freaking kind of tough, too.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because he takes double damage, but he has the shield.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And it would be really hard to make it through the wily stages with Proto Man.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Also, I've played Ragnarok.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ragnarok.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Crack rock.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All right.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And I did homework.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right, so Mega Manorific.

129
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I also watched the debate game, too.

130
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Awesome.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And voted.

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I voted this week.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Awesome.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
As everybody should.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No matter who you support, you should go out and vote.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Because voting is important.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about the result.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right?

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
All right.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was all right.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I only really played a couple things.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Grand Theft Auto IV, as usual.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And I also played more Saints Row 2 because that game's awesome.

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now I'm finished with the Brotherhood storyline.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I'm starting the Sons of Samiti.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And that's kind of interesting.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I tried to play some online deathmatch today, but it was hard to join the game.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I ended up quitting on that.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And then I played a bit of Fable II.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And got past the child stage and started your adult life.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And really got distracted with dancing in front of people.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And then I got an achievement for it.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And that's where I quit.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, yeah.

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Awesome.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, you've been getting a sneak peek at a lot of early holiday games.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Because Fable II's not out for a couple weeks, right?

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And Saints Row II is out, what, this week?

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tuesday.

163
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Finally?

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, at least you'll finally have some people to play multiplayer with.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Awesome.

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It'll be cool.

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And keep finding new things to do in that game.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's awesome.

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So you didn't really spend a whole lot of time with Fable II, so you can't tell us a whole lot more about it.

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Like, how does it compare to the first one?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I never played the first one, so that I really can't tell you.

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Gotcha.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, let's see.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Moving on.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My gaming week.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You know, I've been playing a variety of stuff.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Pretty much the old stuff.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You know, the old standbys.

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Warcraft and so on.

181
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I did check out a couple new games.

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Beat and Groovy on Xbox Live Arcade.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're long-time music game fans.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I mean, you know, the roots of our station, the name of the station, comes from old school music games.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And you actually see it show up in this game, Beat and Groovy.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Because one of the songs is by a group called Orange Lounge.

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And that's kind of where the name of our radio station came from.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, I would usually encourage you to buy a game like Beat and Groovy.

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But you know what, guys?

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's just not that great.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I know that sounds horrible, because poppy music is a pretty awesome game franchise.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But here's the problem.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Is that they want to charge you $10 for 9 songs.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And not only is it 9 songs, but it's 9 songs kind of thrown together that you have no choice to play with but the controller.

195
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You cannot remap the buttons in this game, which is very annoying.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because two of the buttons use the control pad.

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And actually, a third one kind of shares it too.

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I play the way where you use the D-pad for only 2.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But you sometimes accidentally hit the third one if you kind of like flick the D-pad too fast.

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So that sucks.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Gosh, and here's the thing.

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Beat and Groovy would have been like the shit in 1998 on the Playstation 1.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Because it's probably not that different from what the first release of poppy music was in Japan.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So somebody up there at Konami of Japan is thinking,

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, well if the first release of poppy music did well in Japan, we're going to mirror the first release of American poppy music off of it.

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Even though we're not going to have a controller and put in some different songs.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It just doesn't work.

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I mean, there's so many just borked things about this game.

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And it's unfortunate because there's a good game in here somewhere.

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I know, I've seen it.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've seen the import versions of poppy music, which are some really fun music games.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And it's a shame that now people who don't get music games,

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
or people that think that Guitar Hero was the first music game ever made,

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
or maybe like Frequency or Amplitude,

215
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
are going to think that this whole franchise is just total crap based off of this.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I mean, A, you can't remap the controls.

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When you play online, you can only play online in three button mode.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The hardest song is three notes on a scale of one to nine, basically.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So you know this game is built to just have microtransactions added on top of it.

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They're going to try to add new songs.

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They're going to try to add new difficulties and all this stuff.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I really urge you guys, I don't think you should support this.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I mean, and it sounds horrible because I've always been a big supporter of Konami and the music game series,

224
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and I love DDR, and I love BeatMania 2DX.

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh my god, I love BeatMania 2DX.

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But if this is what we're going to get, is these type of scraps, I reject it.

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And I don't think we should have to support it simply because it's pop and music,

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
and simply because it's the game we want to see.

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And I'm sorry, I reject those calls that say we should buy this because then we might get this.

230
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry, no.

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We don't live in that day and age anymore.

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If Konami hasn't learned the lesson by now that Americans are willing to latch on to good music games,

233
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
then they're just not going to get it.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So I see no need to buy this game to somehow justify them to fix it and put out the game they should have in the first place.

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That being said, I did buy the game, but I felt some type of editorial obligation to because I don't get them for free,

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and I wanted to give you a fair impression here on the show.

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But again, this game is just so borked.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
By the way, the leaderboards, you would think the leaderboard scores would be like endless mode,

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
or who got the highest score on this song.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Nope, it's one leaderboard, and it's for online mode, and it's not even wins versus losses.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a cumulative score.

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So in other words, the person who's ranked number one on the beat-and-groovy leaderboard

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
is just the person who's played the most matches online and gotten the highest score because of it.

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's dumb.

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's dumb.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This game is borked in so many ways, and it's really, really sad.

247
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I looked at video, and it made my heart break a little bit.

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There you go.

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So honestly, I mean, again, it's sad because I think there could have been a good game here,

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
but for right now, if you want to play a decent music game on Xbox Live Arcade, just go get Boom Boom Rocket.

251
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's the same concept.

252
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You mash buttons to things when they hit a line.

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a lot better looking.

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I wish I could say the music's better in Boom Boom Rocket,

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
but actually that would be the one thing that Pop'n Music has on the other game, Boom Boom Rocket,

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
is that the song list is slightly better, even if it is nine songs.

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There's some pretty good songs in it, like Moon and Star Mine and the Earth whatever song that sounds like the...

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, that song's pretty cool too.

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey, Rob.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What?

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We should go to my house and play Pop'n Music.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We should.

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I mean, honestly, if you want to play a great music game that's like Beat'n Groovy,

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
go import Pop'n Music. Seriously.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I really, really, really want an arcade-style controller.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, they are fun. I had a friend that had one.

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They're fun.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's just kind of weird that they would release this game with no controller here.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I know.

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It makes no sense because, I mean, have you ever tried to play Pop'n Music on the PlayStation controller?

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah.

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's freaking hard.

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Although it is kind of fun to try it on the 2DX controller.

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Now, our buddy Bobby Black Wolf actually did this pretty awesome YouTube that compares Beat'n Groovy to Pop'n Music 13.

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The note charts are the exact same, which is fine.

276
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I understand that.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I mean, I don't hold that against them except for the fact that sometimes you have the purple and the blue notes come up back to back,

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and when you have to use a control pad for both of those, it makes it hard.

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You can't hit two on the control pad at the same time, and you can kind of do upper left, but it's mixed results at best.

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And what if you have the purple and the orange?

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Well, I guess you can hit one with the Y, but still, it just, bleh.

282
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Doesn't work.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You need to be able to remap the buttons.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This game has just too many bugs in it.

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They need to go back to the drawing board.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's really it as far as new games.

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I did play Feeding Frenzy 2, which reminded me, of course, a lot of the first one with some different bonuses,

288
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
but I didn't play it enough to give it a full review.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I did enjoy myself.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I enjoyed myself in probably the ten minutes I played Feeding Frenzy 2 more than I did probably the hour I spent with Beat'n Groovy just having a cry.

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I forgot to mention with Saints Row 2.

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
All the cheat codes leaked online, including those wonderful exclusive codes that GameStop had if you pre-ordered the game.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No to anyone buying anything from GameStop.

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If it has a code involved with it, and it's not actually a Microsoft code where you download something off of their service, it's going to leak out immediately.

295
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And that's fun.

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They have the Evil Cars code in there.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They have a code to get, like, a pocket bike, and then you can do a code to make yourself even larger so it looks like you're just sitting down and driving that way.

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Super explosions, yeah.

299
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Reading some comments from chatroom about Beat'n Groovy.

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,000
GS68 says, when if I somehow get a job over the winter, I'll use the monies for a desktop arcade and one of the CS releases.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, that'll probably be a better investment.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
DJ Dysentery says, well, props for Starmine at least.

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I agree, it does seem like they kind of tried to throw us a bone or two on the song list.

304
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They gave us some really cool songs.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But, yeah.

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, did you notice that the game, I mean, I didn't even play it at all, but just from the videos, the game has, like, this urban vibe to it, and then there's Super Eurobeat in there.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's like, huh?

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Well, it's, you know what, this game wasn't, it's weird, because I feel like this game wasn't really made for America, even though it came out here.

309
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It definitely caters to the Japanese style.

310
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
SSJ100Matt says, it tried to be like Boom Boom Rocket, except it wasn't fun.

311
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's kind of the whole thing, though, is that it wasn't trying to be Boom Boom Rocket, because this game's been out for years and years before Boom Boom Rocket.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's just that, unfortunately, that's the impression most people are going to have of this game, because of the fact that it's lackluster in many, many departments.

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And it pains me to say that.

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I know there is a great game in there somewhere.

315
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I've played pop music 11, 12, 10, 8.

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I've played tons of pop music games.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's way fun, especially with that giant controller.

318
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This, not fun.

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I wonder if they just, you know, said, hey, you know, let's just go ahead and have a company make pop music for us for the 360 and Xbox Live Arcade.

320
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And they get it back and they're like, crap, this sucks, let's call it Beaten Groovy instead, because we don't want to tarnish the pop music name.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I think the first half of what you said is spot on.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think this game was to outsource for completion.

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And I think whoever was in charge of some of the decisions needs to be whipped with a wet noodle.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's all.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Anyhow.

326
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What if it, though, is testing the waters?

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Then they failed.

328
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
For potential release.

329
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's what fucking bugs me about Konami of Japan, is that they shouldn't have to.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If you want to see if a music game is going to do good here in America, fucking look at Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If they're not going to, God, it just makes me angry how fucking dense they are in not understanding the music.

332
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I mean, they have a fucking cult based around these music games here in America.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And they just, they turn a blind eye to it all the time and release crap like this.

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well, it worked in Japan, so it must work in America.

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Ten years ago it worked in Japan.

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Times have changed.

337
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The bar has been risen.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Wake up, Konami of Japan.

339
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Wake up.

340
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Rob for president.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Twelve.

342
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, I'm kidding.

343
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
F that.

344
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Make me CEO of Konami.

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll go change some things real quick.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Alright.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Anyhow.

348
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's move on.

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sorry, GS68, the FUs are not coming up next.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We have those, believe me, there's other things to piss you off later in the show.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Alright, look, we've got to get into gaming news.

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's talk about housekeeping a little bit.

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
First off, for those listening live tonight, last week's show archive never got put up because I'm slow.

354
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I got very busy this week, so I apologize.

355
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Folks that are listening to this on the podcast, you will have already seen 297 finally fall in probably tonight or Monday at the absolute latest.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And 298 should be right up on Tuesday or Wednesday.

357
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So I apologize for the delay.

358
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But it happens.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Life gets in the way.

360
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We're not the only podcast that sometimes gets a little slow, so sorry about that.

361
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Always, there is our live journal and MySpace and Facebook that we like to plug as well.

362
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Live Journal, Orange Lounge.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And Facebook, OL Army.

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Be sure to add us on those various sites.

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And Twitter now as well, OLR.

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And we'll get to the pre-show OLR Twit question in just a little bit when we start talking about Tokyo Game Show, which I'm sure we're going to get to during the news report.

368
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But first, some news out of the Tokyo Game Show that I'm kind of surprised wasn't announced here in America, right, Loki?

369
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Exactly.

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I think, well, really the last US Microsoft press conference that they had was pretty much at, well, I guess I could have done one at PAX.

371
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But it was pretty much at E3, and of course this game was rumored to have been about to be announced at E3, but for whatever reason they stopped it.

372
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So they left it for Tokyo Game Show, and of course that game is Halo 3 Recon.

373
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's the one that they were teasing with the Bungie little viral video thing that they released, a brand new teaser trailer.

374
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And Halo 3 Recon will be a standalone game, includes new multiplayer maps.

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It takes place before Halo 3, and actually it's a totally different style of a game.

376
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Of course you're not exactly one of the Spartan soldiers, so one or two hits and you're pretty much going to be dead.

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I think it sounds more of like a stealthy game since you're kind of, you know, recon.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And, I don't know, it looks kind of neat.

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They announced it's going to be coming out in the fall of 2009.

380
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's kind of surprising because I thought it was supposed to be coming out in the spring, or at least it would have made more sense to come out in the spring, I think.

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But, I don't know.

382
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So I guess this is the next big Halo game that we're going to be getting.

383
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Do you think it's going to do as well as Halo 3?

384
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't think so.

385
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Halo 3 was, I think it was one of those games where the hype really killed it.

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I mean like Halo 3, I think if it didn't have all that hype behind it, would have been pretty well received.

387
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But I think a lot of people grew tired of it really fast because there was so much hype around it and how it was just going to be so much better than Halo 2.

388
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And then it was like, eh, it's Halo 2 but prettier.

389
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't think this is going to do as well because I think it's running off the same engine.

390
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And also the fact that unless you're a really big Halo fan, I don't know really if you're going to enjoy much of the prologue to the whole Halo 3 stuff.

391
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I mean, to me, I played through Halo and I sort of know what was going on and I don't know, this doesn't seem that interesting to me.

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let me go on a side little adventure here and I want to talk about a story that somehow shockingly did not make tonight's show roll.

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I just scrolled through to make sure it wouldn't come up later.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But you know, BlizzCon was also going on this week.

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
One of the big things that came out of BlizzCon was that Starcraft 2 is actually kind of getting split into three different games.

396
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
They're going to have like one game surrounding each of the different races inside Star Trek and that was some of the big news that hit the internet this week.

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And a lot of people were like, rabble, rabble, rabble.

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't believe they're going to make us pay three full games for, you know, it's one game for the price of three and blah, blah, I'm getting shafted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.

399
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And I kind of look in the story about Halo 3 Recon and I'm going, well is this much different?

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It is different because they've already had a full campaign for, you know, Halo 3.

401
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is a brand new story that takes place in, you know, a different time in the series.

402
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, but Starcraft 2 is going to have that full multiplayer which is what everybody plays anyway and it's going to have a fleshed out single player story mode.

403
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I mean, they're just kind of approaching it a different way.

404
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Not that I'm totally defending what Blizzard's doing, but I don't see how you can say boo to that and then go, yay, another Halo 3.

405
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I still think it's cheap though. I mean, look at like Red Alert. There's a perfect example.

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The game has a few different factions and there's a storyline for each one.

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, you know, other games have done it. They have, you know, multiple sides and they have multiple storylines.

408
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But Halo 2's single player mode was also done like that.

409
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So it's Halo 3.

410
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Right, they're slightly lackluster.

411
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The thing is, I think this should be download content. If it's going to be running off the same engine, just have it as a downloadable game, not this retail thing.

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because now if it's retail, we can charge, you know, $59.99 for it.

413
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A lot more than you can charge for an Xbox, you know, expansion or something like that.

414
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So, I don't know. It's just...

415
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:31,000
By the time, I guess, Halo's going to be coming out, you know, Halo 3, by the time, you know, this new game comes out, Halo 3 will probably be like $29.99.

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I wouldn't be surprised if they do, like, a game of the year edition or something like that or, you know...

417
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Eventually it'll be combined.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They're going to combine them.

419
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah, I know.

420
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And, you know, we need one more game because, you know, what game...

421
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
We need a trilogy to complete the trilogy.

422
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Exactly. Exactly. You know, who doesn't want three of something?

423
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It all comes in threes, right?

424
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I was very curious to see what our chat room would say in response to this.

425
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The Rob D says, the difference is that there's a precedent in strategy games for putting a different campaign in for each faction.

426
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
In FPS games, there's always been an expansion pack for a new campaign.

427
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If Halo 1 had different campaigns that were all free and Halo 2 didn't, people would be complaining about it just like they are about StarCraft.

428
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's not even just two purchases. It's three purchases, triple the cost.

429
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Act F says it's basically what I said last week with the ACDC track pack.

430
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
SSJ100Matt says people are suckers, especially for Blizzard games.

431
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And, uh, let's see, um...

432
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It would be different if they had, like, you know, a storyline for all of them, like a campaign,

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and then later on they added a new expansion that had more storyline for all the campaigns or something like that.

434
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Break it up like that and have expansions.

435
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I just kind of think people are passing judgement on the StarCraft 2 thing too quickly without really seeing what each individual game has to offer.

436
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They're only looking at it at face value, going, oh, three different games? What? What?

437
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And then I'm just going, well, how is that different from most, you know?

438
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And Rob D brings up a good point, like FPSs have kind of done this for a long time.

439
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Look at, uh, go back to the days of Shareware and, um, Quake.

440
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Quake had, like, what, four different episodes? The first one was free, but you had to pay for each of the other ones individually.

441
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But all the other four, um, or the other three campaigns that were in there were part of the retail version.

442
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Shareware, it's just the same as saying, okay, you get one level in this demo and then you get the other ten when you buy the full game.

443
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's not, it's not an excuse for just adding this as its own thing.

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Or, well, I'm just saying for StarCraft, that's just, I'm sorry, that's to get more money.

445
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The whole thing is probably, oh, our game's going to be pirated to hell, so we need to sell more copies.

446
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
How do we sell more copies? We split it up into three.

447
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Because it's not a storage issue. It's not a time issue. I can tell you right now that these are probably not going to be very fleshed out.

448
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, what can, how long can a strategy campaign last for?

449
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I mean, not very long, so, great. Let's just do one for each specific thing.

450
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You know, if you want to do something different, just do, like, you know, different packaging, you know, with different sides on it or something like that.

451
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You know, collector's editions type stuff. I'm taking a wait and see approach.

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I mean, you know, if games can be compared to movies, sometimes movies are released in three different parts.

453
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And, you know, we still go see all three of them, like the Star Wars trilogy, the new one.

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Matrix trilogy, even though that is questionable about its, you know, value.

455
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But, you know, we'll pay three times to see the full movie.

456
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
But it's a full movie. It's not like I'm watching, you know, like a Batman movie.

457
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And one of the movies is from the perspective of Batman.

458
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Do you not think Starcraft 2 is not going to be a full game?

459
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I don't think. Well, the way it sounds like now, I don't think each one's going to be a full game.

460
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
They're going to call them a full game, and it'll be a full campaign for one side, but it's going to feel kind of cheap because, you know, what's the other stuff?

461
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So, say, what if I'm playing, you know, the first one and I want to play the campaign for something else?

462
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh, I can't do that now. Sorry, you've got to go buy the other one.

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
All right, well, if you want to give us a comment on that, you can always send us an email.

464
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or you can call us a little later on in the program.

465
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
For now, though, we'll move on to some more gaming news, talking about 360 and some holiday bundles that are coming out.

466
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Hooray! Free games now coming with your Xboxes.

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Wait, wait, wait. This is totally new news.

468
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I know. Never heard this one before. Well, it has been confirmed, okay, that there is now a 199 arcade holiday bundle.

469
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And with it, you will get Sega Superstars Tennis and five Xbox Live arcade games that have not yet been announced.

470
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Well, actually, I think the arcade games, they've been actually changing a little bit because I remember when I first bought an arcade to replace my broken system.

471
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
There was, you know, a bunch of games with it now.

472
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I actually got a new arcade system for my sister for her birthday and it had slightly different stuff.

473
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Like, they had Boom Boom Rocket in there, there was Pac-Man Championship Edition, Luxor 2, Feeding Frenzy, and...

474
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
A sampling. A sampling of some of the newer stuff.

475
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same thing.

476
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
In fact, I would say it's exactly the same thing because for the people that don't have the bundles or haven't purchased them,

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
they get a disc that goes in, or they get those two free games that go in there and they put them in and then put the sticker on the box.

478
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
All right, well, if you want to jump up and get the 299 or 399 levels, that would be for the, what I just called the normal Xbox 360.

479
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The pro and the elite.

480
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I know it's the pro, but that's the one that most people are probably getting is the pro.

481
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The hardcore gamer gets the elite, the person who doesn't know better and just wants the cheapest one gets the arcade.

482
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The normal Xbox 360 is 299, or the elite for 399.

483
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
You get Lego, Indiana Jones, and Kung Fu Panda for free.

484
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Probably those titles were selected because they're both rated E for everyone and they, you know, it's the holidays.

485
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
They're pushing the family games.

486
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They want to push this as a family system because that's one area where the Xbox 360s always seem to lack.

487
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And to be fair, those games are actually pretty good.

488
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Yeah, especially the Lego one is good.

489
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well, even Kung Fu Panda was actually rated pretty good and it wasn't that cheap. It wasn't like a cheap movie game.

490
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
All right, well, there you have it.

491
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Hey, one more comment on the last story because some of the, you know, because of the delay between when we say something and when it goes out to the stream on all games radio,

492
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
which is just inevitable with internet radio or even over the area radio,

493
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
reading a comment from Retertainment from the last story about Blizzard and we kind of got in that little disagreement there.

494
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
All companies want to make as much money as humanly possible.

495
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Blizzard thinks they can make mad bucks on this deal, so they are going to go through with it.

496
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
If the community says in mass that this is not the case, they will change their plans.

497
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But the community won't.

498
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You know it. I know it.

499
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Yeah, just like the community bitched and moaned, well, I should say a few individuals bitched and moaned about the Diablo 3 art style and we got a t-shirt out of it at least.

500
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We'll see.

501
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
All right, so anyhow, yeah, so if you haven't gotten your Xbox 360 yet, you might want to wait until those package deals show up because, hey, free games!

502
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's hard to complain about free games. That's more than I got.

503
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
They should be out there now, I think.

504
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
That's more than I got when I got my Xbox 360.

505
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Well, how about something that makes me super excited about the Xbox 360?

506
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Barbie Horse Princess, part 2.

507
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
They're making a babysitting game in there?

508
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
To quote Patty from Twitter earlier, Diana Né Pompeire.

509
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
No.

510
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Tekken 6 is going to be out on the Xbox 360 in Fall 2009.

511
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That makes me super happy.

512
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Super, super happy.

513
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Because then I don't have to get it on PlayStation 3.

514
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But, I don't know, I might get it on PlayStation 3, but I love Tekken.

515
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I am the world's biggest Tekken fangirl, and according to Microsoft, it's going to be out on Fall 2009.

516
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You know, and I don't know if it was ever announced that it was an exclusive, but that's one less exclusive that they get.

517
00:29:49,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It was considered to be before PS3 exclusive, especially given that one of the demos for the PlayStation 3 was actually renderings of Jin from the Tekken series.

518
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, this was actually confirmed at the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2008 press conference for Namco Bandai.

519
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm kind of curious, as a Tekken fangirl, how you feel about this announcement about Tekken going by.

520
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And by by, I mean, of course, by system all.

521
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Because, you know, I had another friend of mine who was pretty into Tekken who was like,

522
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
wow, that is big news for Tekken to not come out on a Sony system only.

523
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
That's huge.

524
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
No, it is. I agree.

525
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:41,000
In fact, in the past, as far as I'm aware, every American Tekken release has been out on a Sony system.

526
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
There has been a Tekken card fighter game that came out in Japan on Wonderswan.

527
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But then again, that's Bandai's system.

528
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We don't count the spin-offs.

529
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Then we'd have to count Death by Degrees and no one wants to remember that game.

530
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But then again, that's also in the Tekken franchise and it did only come out for PlayStation 2, right?

531
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
True.

532
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So I do believe, if I'm correct, there's only ever been one Tekken game that came out on a non-Sony system.

533
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
And that was the Wonderswan.

534
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But then again, a lot of Sony franchises did come out on the Wonderswan.

535
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So for them to give that much of a nod to the Xbox 360, I think is very, very big.

536
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Some of the chatters just want to throw this out there.

537
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
AlphaKananagram and Hitstun want to remind you, there was Tekken Advance on Game Boy Advance.

538
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's right. That was the other one I was trying to think of. I actually do have that one too.

539
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So out of, let's see, five games tagged tournament, there were only two other games that came out.

540
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Dark Resurrection came out on-

541
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And they weren't, I mean, with all due respect, these other two games weren't real Tekken games, quote-unquote.

542
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
These other ones we're thinking of are arcade, ports, the base Tekken series.

543
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
We don't count these other ones.

544
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Dark Resurrection, though, was an actual Tekken game, but that came out on PSP.

545
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I was going to read a comment from chat.

546
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Tigerclaw on chat says, you know, Namco has pretty much slapped Sony in the face by becoming multiplatform.

547
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Tekken has been a PlayStation exclusive since day one.

548
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That pretty much was it.

549
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Especially when you had all your PlayStation releases have the compatibility with each other to go back and look at your movies and everything.

550
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I just, I really do think that it's a really big deal.

551
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
On top of that, I think it's also going to be, I'm not calling it a nail in the coffin for Sony,

552
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
but I think it's definitely a major wake-up call that they're not doing something right.

553
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
They had been doing right when the PlayStation came out.

554
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
They had been doing right when the PS2 came out. Am I right?

555
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Absolutely. Those are both fantastic systems.

556
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
As far as their sales went, their marketing strategy, as far as them coming out over the top of the competition,

557
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
and now they're sliding, now they're falling into, sorry, they're falling into the Sega Pit.

558
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Well, it's interesting, though, because here in America, you know, that's kind of the general perception.

559
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I mean, granted, there's Sony fanboys, there's my, you know, every console will always have its fanboys until the end of time.

560
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
However, but in Japan, I'm kind of looking at this and going, is this really going to make a difference in Japan?

561
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean, I don't see this moving Xbox 360s in Japan suddenly.

562
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I just don't see this, you know, in my mind, this is more of a, hey, let's get Tekken 6 to more people in America.

563
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I don't think this is going to mean a hill of beans in Japan. I think most people will still get it for PS3.

564
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Keep in mind, though, the Saturn did very well in Japan.

565
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
True.

566
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And the Saturn did not do well over here because of marketing.

567
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
They didn't bring out the games that the fans were interested in.

568
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
They didn't market the system properly.

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And now that's happening with the PS3 over here.

570
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
They're basically pulling a Sega.

571
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They're trying to rest on, oh, well, we had this system back in the day.

572
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yeah, but what do you have now?

573
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The Dreamcast was fantastic, don't get me wrong.

574
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
The Saturn to this day is one of my favorite gaming systems.

575
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But did they have the right support over here?

576
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
No.

577
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And what's happening to the PlayStation 3 now?

578
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's losing its support.

579
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They're not doing something right.

580
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, the PlayStation 3 is always going to be a Blu-ray player that plays games.

581
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
That's what I agree.

582
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
This will not put Sony out of business.

583
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
There will be a PS4, but we just kind of hope they, you know...

584
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:45,000
If they do a PS4, I think the PS4, they're going to have to turn some shit around before they can actually make it anything that's viable for their company to bring out.

585
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Else they're just going to have to go back to making TVs.

586
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
All right.

587
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
We're getting a little too much into the whole console war now.

588
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And yes, GS68 bless you for SEGA Sanchiro.

589
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
SEGA Sanchiro was awesome.

590
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Let's move on. Let's go back to some more gaming news that I think will also make a lot of folks happy.

591
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yeah. Well, you know, of course there are many games coming to both consoles out there.

592
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But one date that they did announce was the release of the brand new Resident Evil 5 that will be coming to consoles March 12th.

593
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And, of course, that will be coming to the 360 and on the PS3.

594
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And it's all sorts of awesome.

595
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
It's like Resident Evil 4 HD.

596
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I don't know. This game looks freaking sweet to me. I'm excited about Resident Evil 5.

597
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I barely even played Resident Evil 4.

598
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Well, no, I actually spent quite a bit of time on Resident Evil 4. It was a tremendous game.

599
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But I'm just excited about the whole, like, you know, high def and scary scary and all that good stuff.

600
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's pretty good. And now they have co-op, so that's awesome.

601
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Well, another sequel that's making a lot of people go, huh, is 99 Nights 2.

602
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That's right. It was confirmed at the Tokyo Game Show that 99 Nights 2 is coming to the Xbox 360.

603
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But as far as when and how much and what's new about it, nope, no information on that yet.

604
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Just the fact it is coming.

605
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I know a lot of people like to hate on 99 Nights. I didn't think the game was awful.

606
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Like, it's kind of how I feel about Beat and Groovy in some ways.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
No, actually, I don't know. I have that same feeling of 99 Nights, there's a good game in there somewhere,

608
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
but there were just a few flaws that kind of kept it from being great.

609
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Well, look at, like, Dynasty Warriors. Why does that game sell?

610
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I mean, they literally, seriously, they put out three different versions of pretty much the same game

611
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
each time that there's a new release.

612
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You have Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Empires, and Dynasty Warriors,

613
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
God, I remember the XL or something like that, Extreme Legends.

614
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And they're all practically the same.

615
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I mean, I don't really play the series too much, but your average consumer is going to look at all three of those

616
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
and go, I don't get it. What's the difference?

617
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And really, that's kind of like, with this game, it's basically like a Dynasty Warriors clone,

618
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
so the next one comes out, I'm not expecting they're going to change much, hopefully fix some things, and that's it.

619
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Well, you know, they only need to fix a few more things for this game to actually be pretty kick-ass.

620
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I enjoy myself. I like the game.

621
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Rama says, Sky, don't you have 99 Nights? I do. I bought it the day it came out.

622
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But I'm also, you have to remember, I'm also a whore for Q Entertainment.

623
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I mean, seriously, anything Mizuguchi does, I'm going to buy, because he's one of my favorite game designers,

624
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
except Gun Pay. I never got Gun Pay for some reason, but it's on my list.

625
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Can you imagine how awesome Beat and Groovy would have been if Q Entertainment had made it?

626
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I think Q Entertainment should make a game done right, anyway.

627
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Anyway, that's for another day.

628
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But 99 Nights, you know, obviously 99 Nights, as much as I want to say, it's not as bad as you all think.

629
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay, definitely the game had its flaws. It did get boring after a while.

630
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I just hope they can fix some of it with 99 Nights, too.

631
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
There's a good game in there somewhere, and I hope people don't totally pass it off on name alone,

632
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
because, hey, sometimes games don't get really, really good until the sequel.

633
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
For instance, Mega Man.

634
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
A lot of people don't remember Mega Man until Mega Man 2.

635
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not to say the first Mega Man was bad. It was just, you know, just needed a few tweaks,

636
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
and then Mega Man 2 was awesome.

637
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Of course, then again, I wouldn't even compare Mega Man to 99 Nights,

638
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
so I don't know where the fuck I'm going with that analogy.

639
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So why don't we go on to the next story?

640
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't know where the fuck you're going with that analogy, Rob.

641
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I don't either. I'm obviously drunk.

642
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
So how about something else?

643
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
How about it?

644
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Well, you know there had been some rumors about there potentially being a Blu-ray drive on the Xbox 360?

645
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Every week there's some damn rumor about it, yes.

646
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Well, here is the official word.

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Dun dun dun.

648
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This is a quote from one of Microsoft's representatives.

649
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
It says,

650
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
As we've said before, Microsoft has no plans to introduce an Xbox 360 Blu-ray add-on.

651
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Games are what drive consumers to purchase game consoles,

652
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and we remain focused on providing the largest library of blockbuster games available.

653
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And that's a direct quote.

654
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Allow me to translate to all the bloggers around America and throughout the world, really.

655
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I want to provide my translation.

656
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Oh, please. Go ahead.

657
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Shut the fuck up!

658
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's exactly what I was going to say.

659
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Shut the fuck up about the Blu-ray on Microsoft.

660
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
It is not happening.

661
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And if it is going to happen, we'll fucking tell you a long time from now,

662
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
because it's just not something we're interested in right now.

663
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The whole thing that brought that up was that there had been a rumor that Microsoft had commissioned

664
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
the hardware to be made with a Toshiba Samsung.

665
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
But, no.

666
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
And you want to know what?

667
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I love my HD DVD player on it.

668
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But, going back to what I was previously saying about what Sony is doing wrong,

669
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I think that's what Sony's doing wrong.

670
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
They're not focusing on the games, and that's what Microsoft is doing right.

671
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Well, but is that necessarily a bad thing?

672
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Because I look at the PSP and I go, eh, not my favorite gaming system first,

673
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
but the PSP does a lot of cool shit that I like.

674
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
It's kind of like an all-in-one little device.

675
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I can name people off the top of my head who've bought the PSP not as a gaming system,

676
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
but as a multimedia system.

677
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Exactly.

678
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But when I think handheld game system, I think of my DS.

679
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,000
But what's so wrong with the PlayStation 3 taking that same kind of concept about being a home entertainment device?

680
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Because when someone's going to buy a console, it is going to be because they can play games on it.

681
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
That is, I think, the end all of what a video game console is.

682
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It can have all these nice pretty special bells and whistles,

683
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
but in the end, no matter what, what do we always say?

684
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
The console is only as good as the games that are on it.

685
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,000
If they're not putting good games on it, what good is the damn console other than, you know, just playing a movie?

686
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I know somebody who owns a PlayStation 3 for nothing but Blu-ray.

687
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
They don't own a single video game, just the Blu-ray player, because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.

688
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
So it's like, what's the point?

689
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You can buy Blu-ray players.

690
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
One other thing I kind of want to point out, you know,

691
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Microsoft has a high-definition movie download service, and they're rolling out Netflix pretty soon.

692
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Do they really want a Blu-ray player? Probably not.

693
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They probably want to go to this whole digital distribution thing, because there's a lot of money to be made there.

694
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I think that's where it's going. I really do think that that's the future of our media, you know.

695
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised that ten years down the line, you'll have a hard time picking up physical media.

696
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's all going to be downloadable content.

697
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
All right, well, there you have it. No Blu-ray, so you just stop spreading rumors about it. Shut up. Please.

698
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Meantime, though, we've got a lot of other releases coming out that are confirmed and will be happening, right, Loki?

699
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yes, there's plenty of stuff coming out, because we're now in the fourth quarter,

700
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
which is where all the game companies like to hide their games.

701
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And starting off, and of course there's a lot of crap out there,

702
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune for the Wii looks like a piece of shit,

703
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
and Avatar The Last... Please, tell us how you really feel.

704
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Well, okay, let me put it this way. It's by a company called Zoo Games, and all their games have sucked.

705
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Avatar The Last Airbender Into the Inferno.

706
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Hopefully the achievements take a little longer to get than, say, the last game where you could get them all in about five minutes.

707
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And that'll be out on the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.

708
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Blitz League 2 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.

709
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
TAC The Guardians of Gross on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

710
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And of course another TAC game for the DS, Mojo Mistake.

711
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Bratz Girls Really Rock coming to the Wii and DS and PlayStation 2.

712
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:03,000
We've got, let's see, Pray the Stars, which apparently didn't come out last week.

713
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
That is on the DS.

714
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Rob Dine, that's available on all platforms.

715
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Resuscitate the Radio Host. I'm okay, I just drank... Oh god, no, I'm gonna choke again.

716
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Shitty radio, keep reading dates.

717
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Littlest Pet Shop. They are putting out a ton of these because apparently they think they are Nintendogs.

718
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Littlest Pet Shop Winter, Littlest Pet Shop Garden, and Littlest Pet Shop.

719
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I know there's one more. Those are all coming out.

720
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
The Littlest Pet Shop on the Wii and the rest on the DS.

721
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Poker for Dummies on PC. Brain Training for Dummies on PC.

722
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
My Japanese Coach on DS. That's one I'm actually looking forward to checking out.

723
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And let's see, SOCOM Confrontation coming out this week.

724
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You can get that by itself and with the headset or download it on the PlayStation Network.

725
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Saints Row 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Highly recommend checking that out.

726
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer on the DS, if you happen to own a dog.

727
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
And you like to talk to dogs.

728
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I like to talk to dogs. Get off me, dog!

729
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Do they talk back?

730
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Only when I'm high.

731
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Penny Racer's Party Turbo Q Speedway, that's the localization of Qoro Q.

732
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Wait, what? That's a Qoro Q game?

733
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yes, it's a Qoro Q game.

734
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Sweet!

735
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Tenpin Alley 2 coming out on the Wii. Another bowling game.

736
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And, let's see, Rock Revolution on the DS this week.

737
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Oh, goody goody!

738
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Golden Axe Beast Rider on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

739
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Oh, and Rock Revolution will be coming out also, I believe the game only version, on all platforms except for the Wii.

740
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't know why the Wii got delayed. Probably not done yet, making a crappy game.

741
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Dokapon Kingdom on Wii and PlayStation 2, the party game where you're supposed to lose your friends.

742
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
And FIFA Soccer 09 is coming out on all platforms.

743
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Sam & Max Season 1 finally coming out on the Wii.

744
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
A little late there.

745
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Dead Space coming out on PlayStation 2.

746
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Yeah, but it's a way to expose it to a whole new audience that probably missed it on the PC.

747
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Dead Space coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

748
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Lots of stuff.

749
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I actually think I want to get Rock Revolution. I don't know why.

750
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I don't know, I feel like after buying Beat & Groovy this week, I just need to kind of complete my Konami the year the music games died for us trifecta.

751
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Save your money, please.

752
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I don't know.

753
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Please, I urge you.

754
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I think I'm going to get it.

755
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
One of us has to do it. For the sake of reporting on it for the show, someone's got to take the plunge.

756
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
I will take care of the game, but please.

757
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Anyways, Safecracker coming to the Wii.

758
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Let's see here, Hot Dish for PC.

759
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, Hot Dish!

760
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
SpongeBob SquarePants, The Game of Life for the PC.

761
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Wow, digging at the bottom of the barrel here.

762
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Enchanted Fairy Friends, Secret Fairy.

763
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,000
And, damn, there's still more stuff coming out.

764
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Cake Mania, Baker's Challenge on PSP.

765
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
World of Goo coming out on PC.

766
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Not one person who listens to this show gives a shit about Cake Mania on the PSP.

767
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Hey, it's a casual game, okay? Seriously.

768
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It's popular, it's online, and then finally this might be a game you're interested in.

769
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Rock Band 2 coming out.

770
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Both the special edition bundles on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and the game only on PlayStation 3.

771
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
There we go.

772
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
A week from today.

773
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
There we go.

774
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Saving the best for last.

775
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
And that is your gaming week.

776
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
How about Japan?

777
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
How about them?

778
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
How about them? How you doing over in Japan?

779
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Xbox 360, you have Facebreaker to look forward to this week on the 16th.

780
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
That's that boxing game that looks kind of funny, right?

781
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I don't know much about this game.

782
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I saw it a little bit at Petty Arcade Expo, that was about it.

783
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's like Ready to Rumble.

784
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Okay.

785
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You're also getting it on the PlayStation 3, Facebreaker this week, and that's pretty much your big titles.

786
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That's really your only big title on the current systems.

787
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:45,000
However, the Wii gets a whole load of crap this week, including Wii Music makes its way out this week.

788
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Oh boy.

789
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
The music doesn't stop there.

790
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
You also get the Guitar Hero games are finally making their way to the Wii this week in Japan.

791
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Legends of Rock, that's Guitar Hero 3, as well as Aerosmith, and a bundle for Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

792
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I believe that is, again, just like last week on the other systems, that's Guitar Hero 3 by itself,

793
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
because I think the bundle was all they had for a while.

794
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So there you go.

795
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Also, a game called Skycrawlers, coming out from Namco Bandai,

796
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and Daikaiju Battle, Ultra Colosseum, coming out also from Bandai Namco on the Wii.

797
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
That's big monsters.

798
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Ah, very cool.

799
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Well, there you go. So a pretty big week for the Wii over in Japan.

800
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
If you want to head over to last gen, Arcana Heart gets a price reduction.

801
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It's moving into the best series.

802
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Meisters, comes out this week as well.

803
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
And now we're going to move over to the handhelds and take a look at what's coming out of the Nintendo DS.

804
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yadaman 2 DS comes out this week.

805
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Coldsept DS, that should be fun.

806
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I like Coldsept on the 360.

807
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Away, Shuffle Dungeon, also this week, and Nazo Nazo and Quiz Ichi Kotei Jikan Kyumate comes out as well from Konami this week.

808
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Sounds like some type of quiz little show there.

809
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Coming out on some of the Sony handheld system, that would be the PSP.

810
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It looks like just a bunch of accessories.

811
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I think they're getting some new bundles this week.

812
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
They have a new Slim coming out in Pearl White and Piano Black.

813
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And with that comes a whole bunch of other new accessories.

814
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I think that's the PSP 3000.

815
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh yeah, that is. It's the new redo of the PSP.

816
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Comes out this week, so some of you might be actually importing that.

817
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And if you're not, well, you can look forward to Yusha no Kusei ni Namakida or 2 comes out this week in Japan.

818
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And that is a first person title.

819
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
And it looks like some type of puzzle game.

820
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I think that's the one that's also supposed to be on the PlayStation Network at the same time.

821
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
He said that's a first person game. That's like a reverse.

822
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Oh sorry, first party game.

823
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
That was like a reverse of what they did with Conduit.

824
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Alright, so there you go, your Japanese release dates.

825
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Let's head over to the other pond across the Atlantic this time.

826
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Well, on the 13th comes Equestrian Training on the DS.

827
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That would be, I think that's today now over there, so oops.

828
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
On the 17th, Golden Axe Beast Rider on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

829
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 on Damn Near Everything.

830
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Rapala Fishing Frenzy, whatever, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

831
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Saints Row 2 for PlayStation 3 PC and Xbox 360.

832
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
And What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver on DS.

833
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
So, that would be it.

834
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I think that's coming out here in a few weeks too.

835
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I have absolutely zero interest in that, because you know what?

836
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I have a kitchen, and I have food, and I know how to cook.

837
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I have Iron Chef.

838
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I have the Iron Chef book, and it's awesome.

839
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
That little red book?

840
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Yeah.

841
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Isn't that great?

842
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I want to actually try making the Home Bar Lobster dish that was in there.

843
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Anyways, enough about Iron Chef, but if we are going to talk about Iron Chef.

844
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
The secret ingredient is more skins for Little Big Planet.

845
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And GameStop is sweetening the deal with their pre-orders.

846
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Before you could get your Kratos skin on, or at least see different parts of it to create your own Kratos Sackboy.

847
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
But now you'll be getting also a Medusa.

848
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Looks like a skin set there.

849
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
And costumes for, looks like a minotaur.

850
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
So that's pretty awesome.

851
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And those will be available when the game is released a couple weeks from now.

852
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So that's pretty sweet.

853
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
And then, of course, Tokyo Game Show.

854
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
They were showing off a few more things.

855
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Skins for Solid Snake from, of course, Metal Gear Solid.

856
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And from Final Fantasy VII, they have Sephiroth.

857
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Oh joy.

858
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
No cloud, though. I don't understand why.

859
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
How are you going to have a battle?

860
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Oh my god, you know what that means.

861
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
There's going to be a Final Fantasy VII remake on PlayStation 3.

862
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
This is proof.

863
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And it's going to be done with Sackboys.

864
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's like Potter Puppet Pals, but for the next gen.

865
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Dude, that would be the best game ever.

866
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
That actually would be kind of awesome.

867
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Final Fantasy Puppet Pals. The game.

868
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Very, very awesome.

869
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Cool, cool.

870
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Do you have your little big planet pre-ordered? Are you getting this, Loki?

871
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yes, I am.

872
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
All right.

873
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Redertainment in chat's kind of pissed.

874
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
He says, Sephiroth? No cloud? What the fuck?

875
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Give it time. That's all I know.

876
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Cloud will be later.

877
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Cloud comes with your Final Fantasy VII remake pre-ordered. Duh.

878
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Hello?

879
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
By the way, speaking of little big planets, some other news.

880
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
There was a little bit of, will they, won't they, with the beta?

881
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And will the levels made in the beta be playable in the final game?

882
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And the answer is...

883
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Unicron.

884
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
No, the answer is yes.

885
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And it was confirmed to 1UP because they're able to get confirmations from big developers.

886
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
That indeed, the things that people have been making in the beta, they will transfer over to the final game.

887
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Apparently, though, they're kind of gauging how people feel about this news on the official PlayStation forums.

888
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
So they might change their mind.

889
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Why would you not like this idea, huh?

890
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Because they want everybody to start on the same page.

891
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
That's dumb.

892
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
You don't have access to all the same stuff in the beta, right?

893
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Yeah, I'd say it's win-win because you start the game, there's a ton of fucking content to download.

894
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Exactly.

895
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Why would that be bad? That's good.

896
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Now I can play Bobby's level.

897
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Bobby Blackwolf, of course, is the man who does the show before us here on All Games Radio.

898
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
He actually made a little level that's cute.

899
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's like the quest, because there's a YouTube of it somewhere if you look up his YouTube account.

900
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
It's like the quest to get a beta code.

901
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And it's funny.

902
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's cute. It kind of shows what you can do with the game.

903
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Because, you know, we had that little demo at Penny Arcade Expo and kind of got to play the game.

904
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
We didn't get to see a lot of the editor.

905
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
We really didn't get to see a lot about editing the levels.

906
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And it was kind of cool to see what you can really create.

907
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I don't know how much time he spent on that, but I imagine it wasn't that much.

908
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I hope the Wall of Awesome level's in there.

909
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
With my picture on it.

910
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
What level's...what?

911
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Remember? Because I beat the developer at that little mini-game thing that he did.

912
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Oh yeah, okay.

913
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
So I got a picture on the Wall of Awesome.

914
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh, maybe.

915
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But maybe that was just for Penny Arcade Expo. Who knows?

916
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Yeah. Perhaps.

917
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Awesome.

918
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Well, there you go.

919
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We'll be looking for that.

920
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I'm finally going to have to crack and buy a PlayStation 3 in a couple weeks, finally, I think.

921
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Because I do want this game.

922
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I was just thinking about that, actually.

923
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
How so?

924
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You know, that was for SingStar, right?

925
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
No, no. For LittleBigPlanet.

926
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I mean, I don't know why I said that.

927
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I was thinking about SingStar, though.

928
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Because I've also...okay, because I've also talked about...

929
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Because you wanted the ABBA.

930
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Right, because I wanted SingStar ABBA.

931
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,000
My brain was doing that thing where it jumps topics without me actually saying anything about it.

932
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
No, it's fine. I have said that before.

933
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
But I was thinking about that.

934
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Are those the only two games that you're interested in to get the system?

935
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
For right now, but I'm also interested in Home.

936
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I think Home's going to be kind of cool.

937
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
And, you know, we'll see what kind of comes up next year.

938
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I mean, I was just wondering if that would really be your only two reasons.

939
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And the fact that it's a Blu-ray player. I can benefit from that, too.

940
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah.

941
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
There's enough for me.

942
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Well, we've been discussing the PSP earlier.

943
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Well, here's something that we finally have a confirmation on.

944
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Yoshida Shuhei has said it himself.

945
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That Gran Turismo PSP is in development.

946
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:27,000
But it's...there's actually no real date on it yet.

947
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
In fact, according to this article, when he was asked about it, he actually said,

948
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Good question.

949
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It's in Polyphony Digital and they're working on it.

950
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So, at any rate, they say that the reason that it's been delayed

951
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
is because Polyphony's been working on other projects,

952
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:49,000
but they have been working on Gran Turismo 5 Prolog

953
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and Gran Turismo 5 for PS3,

954
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:59,000
so they were actually working on the PS3 as their priority,

955
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and not the PSP one.

956
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But when he was asked when it would be, he said,

957
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
No comment.

958
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
That's a lame excuse, I think, because this has been in development

959
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,000
since before the PSP was released.

960
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So come on, man. Seriously.

961
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's been in development for a long time now.

962
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
It'll be out when Duke Nukem Forever is out.

963
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
They have to make the graphics extra pretty, remember?

964
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Oh, my ass.

965
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
It's just like they were saying,

966
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Oh, well, we don't know how to make the cars take damage and stuff,

967
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,000
and the car manufacturers don't want us to dirty up their cars and stuff yet.

968
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Other games have the same licensed cars and realistic damage modeling.

969
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Excuses, excuses, excuses.

970
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And you know what?

971
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
By the time your stupid game is released, no one will care.

972
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
The end.

973
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The end.

974
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But one thing you can do in the meantime with your PSP,

975
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
since you won't be playing Gran Turismo on it,

976
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
is you can use it as a secondary monitor.

977
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Thanks to the homebrew community, they have released an app,

978
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
and I know there's another one out there that's also part of something else

979
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
that can do the same thing, but

980
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
PSP DISP version 0.1 allows you to connect your PSP to your PC via the USB cable

981
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and use it as a secondary monitor.

982
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's able to display graphics.

983
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
The hell would you fit on it?

984
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Graphics of 960x544.

985
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's just you have to kind of pan the image around.

986
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
But you can do that, and it's supported, of course, only on the custom firmwares.

987
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Of course.

988
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
4.01 M33 and above.

989
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
So wait, while I have World of Warcraft going on my main computer screen,

990
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I can have WoW head up in a browser window on my secondary screen?

991
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yes.

992
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
That's kind of neat.

993
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Yeah.

994
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
So, I mean, it's cheap.

995
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's good for, like, you know, visualizations or whatever,

996
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
or if you're working on something and you want to view something on your other screen.

997
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Or what if you're designing a PSP website?

998
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
That doesn't work.

999
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Don't!

1000
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
No.

1001
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
PSP doesn't display stuff quite like...

1002
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
You see what I was trying to get at, though.

1003
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I see what you're trying to get at, yeah.

1004
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
You've designed the lovely olrpsp.com,

1005
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
which includes the all-games radio player,

1006
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
so you can listen to us on your PSP live on Sunday nights.

1007
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah, unfortunately the PSP does not display stuff the same as your PC,

1008
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
and it makes it kind of difficult because you have to constantly tweak stuff

1009
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
and then refresh, tweak stuff, refresh.

1010
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah.

1011
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
All right.

1012
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Well, look, one thing that you're going to be able to enjoy a lot more on your PSP,

1013
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
and it doesn't even have to run custom firmware,

1014
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
LocoRoco 2!

1015
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Come on, you knew it was coming because Sony really hyped up the first LocoRoco game.

1016
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You knew it was coming.

1017
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You know what's kind of interesting, though?

1018
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
The game has also been confirmed for Europe as well as Japan, obviously.

1019
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
We all know it's going there.

1020
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
But the thing is that actually the game is going to be coming out first in Europe.

1021
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The game is coming out in November.

1022
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That's right, November in Europe,

1023
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and no date announced yet for Japan as far as I know.

1024
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
I believe it might be early next year.

1025
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So those of you folks over in Europe that always complain you get the shaft,

1026
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Sony loves you!

1027
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
They're giving you LocoRoco 2 first.

1028
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
There you go.

1029
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
LocoRoco is awesome.

1030
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
No word about the American release, though.

1031
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Which is kind of sad-ish.

1032
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
We'd better get it.

1033
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I would think that it would do so much better here than it did there.

1034
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The question is when.

1035
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Will we have to wait until last?

1036
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Will we be in between?

1037
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Well, LocoRoco came out here last time.

1038
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Oh, wait, no, that's Patapon.

1039
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Never mind.

1040
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Which is also getting a sequel.

1041
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
That's what ActDeaf just said in chat.

1042
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
chat.net.org.com.

1043
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Patapon 2 is also coming.

1044
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yes.

1045
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Pwn, pwn, patapon.

1046
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Patapon.

1047
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Well, our next bit of news makes me super happy.

1048
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
That is, if it doesn't suck as much as some of the other later releases did.

1049
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But there's going to be a new Castlevania game on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1050
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
And it's...

1051
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,000
They actually showed about ten seconds of footage of it.

1052
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And no gameplay.

1053
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
It was nothing.

1054
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's being produced by Igarashi.

1055
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And, you know, he's my hero and I got to meet him.

1056
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
It made me so happy.

1057
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
So maybe it's going to be good.

1058
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I'm actually more excited about the other one that's coming out on the handheld.

1059
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh, yeah, Order of Othello.

1060
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Order of Othello, yeah.

1061
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Oh, yeah.

1062
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Igarashi and Igaraki should get together and form a death metal band.

1063
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I think it would be awesome.

1064
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Don't you think?

1065
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Igarashi and Igarashi?

1066
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Yes, Igarashi and Igaraki should get together.

1067
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
The Dead or Alive guy and the Castlevania guy should get together and form a death metal band.

1068
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Dude, he's such a rockstar.

1069
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
He's on the picture here.

1070
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Wearing a leather cowboy hat and holding a whip.

1071
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
And I'm like, dude, you're hot.

1072
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And then Mizuguchi can play keyboards.

1073
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And then who would be the singer?

1074
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
What game designer would be the singer for that band?

1075
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Posting the picture in the chatroom.

1076
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Because, dude, I'm sorry.

1077
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
He looks like a freaking rockstar.

1078
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
He is a freaking rockstar.

1079
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That's why I'm thinking.

1080
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yes, and DarkTessuya says, and do a game.

1081
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
They should all come together and do a game.

1082
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I would die of, I would have a fan-gasm right there.

1083
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I don't know, but they would never agree.

1084
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
They would kill each other first.

1085
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I bet if you gave them both the same premise of the game,

1086
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
we'd get something fucked up from both of them, but in different ways.

1087
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
TheRobD says Miyamoto would be the conductor.

1088
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Inafume is the singer.

1089
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
It's funny.

1090
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Anyhow, we'll see.

1091
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
But anyway, before our dream game designer death metal band comes true, we'll see probably Castlevania.

1092
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
current gen.

1093
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Itagaki is the Gene Simmons of the gaming world.

1094
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Perfect.

1095
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
The Gene Simmons of the gaming world.

1096
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Perfect. He needs a reality show.

1097
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Well, there are some really cool features that were announced for Resistance Retribution.

1098
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
And it kind of works with, a little similar to how some of the PlayStation 2 games would link with the PSP in different ways.

1099
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Well now, what you're going to be able to do with this is, it's a brand new feature called PSP Plus.

1100
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And using Resistance Retribution via USB cable, connecting it to your PS3,

1101
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:29,000
you will actually be able to use your DualShock 3 controller and play the game just using that.

1102
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And then, you can also unlock abilities that are in Resistance 2, the character in that game.

1103
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Nathan Hale, you'll be able to unlock the same abilities for your character in this game.

1104
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And will also allow you to get to different parts of levels and stuff like that.

1105
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Kind of think a little bit like the stuff they had with Sonic and Knuckles,

1106
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
where you can plug in the other Sonic games and get to different portions of the game and stuff like that.

1107
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
So, that's kind of cool.

1108
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And I guess this would also fix that problem with not having the second analog stick,

1109
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
because it does change the controllers though, or the controls around, since you have that second analog stick to look around.

1110
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Or how about they just redesign the PSP with the second analog stick,

1111
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
instead of having this roundabout way that requires the PlayStation 3 as well.

1112
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Hmm, I'll check it out though.

1113
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Yeah, I mean, you're still going to get this game no matter what, right?

1114
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Resistance 2, it will.

1115
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Anyhow, also, moving on to one more story on the PSP, and then we're going to get towards our break time tonight.

1116
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
On the PSP, there is the Wi-Fi store.

1117
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Remember we've been talking about the Wi-Fi store that's coming?

1118
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Hey, the date has been announced.

1119
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
October 15th, the Wi-Fi store will be launched in Japan,

1120
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
but you know that it's not much longer before it's here.

1121
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And that probably is in line with the fact that the PSP 3000 comes out this week as well,

1122
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
so don't think there's not a correlation there.

1123
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
With the 5.0 firmware.

1124
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's right, 5.0 firmware will also be the same time.

1125
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
The Wi-Fi store is already on the box art for the PSP 3000, so...

1126
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Well, which makes sense, because if the PSP 3000 doesn't hit street until October 16th,

1127
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
they're basically launching this the day before.

1128
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
There you go.

1129
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Some games that are going to be sold on the store that already are dated,

1130
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Secret Agent Clank on November 20th,

1131
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Patapon 2 on November 27th,

1132
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
and LocoRoco 2 on December 4th.

1133
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
There's that date I was looking for earlier, so yeah,

1134
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Europe's getting it by a couple weeks.

1135
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
LocoRoco 2 specifically,

1136
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
because the store itself has not been announced for the US or Europe,

1137
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
but I would speculate, well, whenever the new PSP redesign is coming out here,

1138
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
that's when we'll get the store.

1139
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
October, yeah, it's like right around the corner.

1140
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
That's what I thought.

1141
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Usually those firmware updates, they're all about the same time,

1142
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
like within a day of each other.

1143
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Alright, so anyhow, the Wi-Fi store is going to be opening soon,

1144
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
and also opening soon as part B of our show,

1145
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
but before we get to part B of our radio show,

1146
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
we need to get to the classic video game of the week.

1147
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It's a little segment we do here every week on this program

1148
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
where DarkSakura takes a look through history's past

1149
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
to find a game for us to look at.

1150
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
So tell us, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?

1151
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Well, if anyone could guess from the music...

1152
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
They won't hear that on the podcast, by the way.

1153
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I want to edit that little boo-boo out, so...

1154
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Well, then I would totally give them a cookie,

1155
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
you know, a virtual cookie,

1156
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
but the game of the week is KOU Gekitai,

1157
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
which came out over here as KOU Flying Squadron.

1158
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's a game of a girl who has this ancestral obligation

1159
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:40,000
to go destroy monsters while riding on the back of her lazy little dragon friend.

1160
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Her dragon is named Poji in the American version and the UK version.

1161
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
He was called Spot.

1162
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But anyway, her...

1163
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Bunny, I don't see a spot.

1164
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Her special outfit, though, that she has to wear for destroying evil is a bunny girl suit.

1165
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It came out... We actually got it as KOU Flying Squadron on the Sega CD over here.

1166
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
There's also KOU Gekitai Katsu Gekihen,

1167
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
which was KOU Flying Squadron 2, which was on Saturn.

1168
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
That's the game. I actually own that one.

1169
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
There was also KOU Gekitai Okira Tamatai Bako, which is like a demo CD.

1170
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:32,000
And then there was Ramichan no Oedos Tsugoroku KOU Gekitai Gaiden,

1171
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
which was like a special bonus story for Rami, who is the little girl in the game.

1172
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So it is a little shooting game.

1173
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,000
It's a cutesy little shooting game where, like I said,

1174
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Rami sits on the back of a dragon, and she has a large mallet for hitting enemies.

1175
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000
She has an umbrella for hitting enemies, and a bow, so she can shoot arrows at enemies.

1176
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Rami can bounce on enemies' heads and kill them that way.

1177
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You can also shoot at them, and you get little bonus buddies to help you.

1178
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I guess it's like your options that was in KOU Flying Squadron 2.

1179
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:15,000
The first one had, it was basically just a few less options of that since it was very limited.

1180
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And all this audio in it, of course, was redbook audio.

1181
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Are those pigs that look like people?

1182
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yes.

1183
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Cool.

1184
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
So they're very fun little games.

1185
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:34,000
There's also, in KOU Flying Squadron 2, there's another character called Himiko,

1186
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:41,000
who made a robot called the Saivi, and she was KOU's rival.

1187
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I'm not K-O, why am I thinking? Rami's rival.

1188
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And then there was an intelligent raccoon who was their enemy.

1189
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,000
He was a member of Greenpeace.

1190
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,000
And he's from Mexico.

1191
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
A raccoon from Mexico.

1192
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
He was a member of Greenpeace.

1193
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
He was a bad guy.

1194
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So that's...

1195
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
This looks kind of cute. I've never heard of this game in my life.

1196
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
It's cracked out.

1197
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Because I didn't really follow the whole Sega empire until years later.

1198
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
But this is cute.

1199
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Kind of a fun little shmup.

1200
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
It's a fun little game. I love it.

1201
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Very cool.

1202
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And also just to go ahead and give a plug to the site, because I checked it out last night.

1203
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Go to SoaringRabbit.com.

1204
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
There's lots of cool art from the game on there and stuff from the guidebooks and things.

1205
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
It's a really cool little site.

1206
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
KO Flying Squadron is your game of the week.

1207
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Check it out on the Sega Saturn, if you can.

1208
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
But if you can't, you'll just have to watch clips on YouTube or try to find an emulator or something.

1209
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Can you emulate Sega Saturn yet? Have they gotten to that point?

1210
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I think they can. I just haven't bothered.

1211
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
You can play Sega Saturn games.

1212
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yes, you can, basically.

1213
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Alright, awesome.

1214
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Well hey folks, we're going to take a break.

1215
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But don't go anywhere, because when we come back there will be plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1216
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
So reports from BlizzCon. We haven't even gotten to BlizzCon yet.

1217
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So stay tuned. We're hoping somebody's going to call in or we're going to call somebody and get a report.

1218
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I would say live from BlizzCon, but that can't happen because BlizzCon is now over.

1219
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So not live from BlizzCon.

1220
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:31,000
So we'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1221
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
He did. He's going to be the next president.

1222
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
He's like, do you see those fucking lights on the ground?

1223
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
When they get red, STFU.

1224
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
God, I know.

1225
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Pukaki.

1226
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Anyhow, we've got some gaming news to get back into.

1227
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1228
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Hope you enjoyed that music break for those of you guys listening live.

1229
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
If you're not listening live, why not?

1230
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You should join us on Sunday nights live.

1231
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You can even listen to us on the go, thanks to the OLR PSP website that has the all games radio player.

1232
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I think some folks are listening to us on iPhones as well.

1233
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I think there's some application you can use to do that.

1234
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Some type of tuning program.

1235
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
So, pretty awesome.

1236
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But we've got some more gaming news to cover.

1237
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
We've got a BlizzCon report to get to.

1238
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Actually, first off though, since we've been talking about conventions,

1239
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I want to start this segment off before we get to the actual gaming news.

1240
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Reading responses to our Twitter question, the pre-OLR Twit,

1241
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
for those of you guys following us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR,

1242
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
we asked the question tonight, and it was actually about the Tokyo Game Show.

1243
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
It was actually what we were asking about tonight.

1244
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
We wanted to know, have you ever wanted to go to the Tokyo Game Show, and why?

1245
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
What's the biggest reason you want to go?

1246
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Dark Soccer, I'm sure you've wanted to go to the Tokyo Game Show before.

1247
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I'm Pon Man!

1248
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Is that why?

1249
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
No.

1250
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Alright, here's some of our listeners and their responses and why they want to go.

1251
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Let's see, Javier Altman says, yes, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show.

1252
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Why? To get into the panties of as many booth babes as humanly possible.

1253
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Them love Latin cock, oh yeah.

1254
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
That was a nice G-rated response.

1255
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Dark Tetsuya says, hell yes, I've always wanted to go to Japan anyway,

1256
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
but an event like TGS with all the newest Japanese games do want.

1257
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Maron Marvel says, heck yes, I could go if I could.

1258
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Squeenix and Konami are bound to unveil some awesome things to Tokyo Game Show.

1259
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Plus, you know it's Tokyo.

1260
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Act Dev says, yes, it's basically E3, but done way better.

1261
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So it's basically all the great announcements we hear.

1262
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I would like to hear them firsthand.

1263
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Jackson Man says, I'm from Kentucky, so going anywhere but here would be nice.

1264
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Crows says, of course I want to go.

1265
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Japanese games almost always have more.

1266
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I want to go and learn which upcoming games have little anime girls.

1267
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
GeoVidea says, oh hell yes, it's Japan.

1268
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
I've been trying to get there for a few years now.

1269
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
MistyOLR says, admittedly not really.

1270
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I have ASEN and I can actually afford that con compared to going all the way to Japan.

1271
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
A nice realistic answer from Misty.

1272
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Justin says, nah, it's all about PAX.

1273
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I did E3 a few times when it was good.

1274
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
That's enough OMG Game Show spectacle for me.

1275
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
So surprisingly, a couple people saying no.

1276
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I would have assumed that it would have been right 100% yeses across the board.

1277
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So surprises abound on our Twitter.

1278
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Thanks for the responses, folks.

1279
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Well, I think the whole reason that I would really want to go

1280
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
is to go hang out with my friends that live over there.

1281
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Yeah, you know, just to go somewhere else.

1282
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I've never been to Japan. It would be fun.

1283
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I mean, because really, after having been to E3 all those years,

1284
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
it really is a big spectacle, that type of thing, don't you think?

1285
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
There's something about being there.

1286
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It's like magic in the air.

1287
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I don't know, it makes you more excited about everything.

1288
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
More like unwashed fanboys in the air over here.

1289
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh, shush.

1290
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
All right, let's get back into some gaming news now that we've heard from you Twitter folks tonight.

1291
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Loki, all right.

1292
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Well, this is sort of a rumor right now,

1293
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
but apparently the website tinycartridge.com is reporting

1294
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:12,000
that they have found a trademark registered in Japan for what is called DS Scan.

1295
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
And what they theorize it is,

1296
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:21,000
is it's something that's going to be used with the DS Eyes camera to unlock DS content.

1297
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Now, one of the things that they're also speculating is that it's for use with QR codes.

1298
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Which those who do not know,

1299
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
QR codes are those square kind of pixely looking, almost like a UPC code, basically.

1300
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And cell phones have them.

1301
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Most cell phones over in Japan have them.

1302
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
And you find them everywhere, like on boxes, to magazine articles, to websites, etc.

1303
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
And you basically scan it with your camera,

1304
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
and it will take you to a website, reveal more information.

1305
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Some examples are nutritional information on food, directions on Google Maps,

1306
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
contact details, business cards, etc.

1307
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Or even links to different game developer sites and stuff like that.

1308
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So that would be a pretty cool feature,

1309
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and especially since the DS Eyes is going to have a built-in web browser,

1310
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
I could see something like that actually being implemented.

1311
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
So right now, it's all speculation to see how that's going to work.

1312
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I don't know.

1313
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Interesting comments from the chat room.

1314
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Frisbee in chat, chat.orangestop.com, says,

1315
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
DSI e-reader, and Unfolded Raptor says,

1316
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Sad thing I actually bought an e-reader, what a waste of money.

1317
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Act Def says, I have some Animal Crossing e-reader cards.

1318
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Whatever happened to the e-reader?

1319
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I think it's one of those peripherals that they didn't really support that much.

1320
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
But could this be something like that?

1321
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
This could be something like that.

1322
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Like, they could release cards.

1323
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I would think would be kind of cool.

1324
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Before, remember, they were talking about doing something with the DS version of Viva Pinata,

1325
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,000
where they were going to have images that appear on the DS,

1326
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:04,000
and you can scan them with your Xbox 360 camera and import your characters into that.

1327
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Well, now you can do it vice versa that way.

1328
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Oh, but I'm getting total value for my Xbox 360 camera right now.

1329
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
I mean, did you see Camera Mode in Beaten Groovy?

1330
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Wahoo!

1331
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Oh, I'm sorry. I missed that.

1332
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
What was Camera Mode in Beaten Groovy?

1333
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's just, now you hit balloons.

1334
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
It's just, it's tacked on junk.

1335
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Lame. Awesome.

1336
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
No, actually, sadly enough, I'm going to be coming into contact with another camera,

1337
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
because I'm buying that game You're in the Movies.

1338
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Why?

1339
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Because it looks fun. It's like a fun party game.

1340
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Alright.

1341
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
And it unfortunately comes with another camera, so now I have two useless cameras.

1342
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Congratulations.

1343
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah.

1344
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Well, how about some other Nintendo news that you can really get excited about coming out of Tokyo Game Show?

1345
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
No More Heroes 2 is coming out.

1346
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Now, here's the thing, though.

1347
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Actually, it wasn't really necessarily confirmed for the Nintendo Wii.

1348
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Yeah, it's for the Wii.

1349
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Is it?

1350
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Oh, okay.

1351
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Because I remember when they saw the trailer, it didn't say Wii anywhere in it.

1352
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So some people were actually speculating a little bit.

1353
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
But alright, it sounds like it was confirmed for the Wii, which makes sense.

1354
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You know, it makes sense.

1355
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
No More Heroes, Desperate Struggle is the name of the game.

1356
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,000
See, people thought it might have been for the DS, because, you know, Desperate Struggle.

1357
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
DS.

1358
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Oh, good thought, yeah.

1359
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
So okay, yeah, that makes sense.

1360
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
And of course, there's folks wishful thinking it would be on 360 or PlayStation 3.

1361
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
But I wish it were.

1362
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
It's another Wii game.

1363
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
You played a lot of the first No More Heroes game, Loki.

1364
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Are you excited?

1365
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah, I am excited. I thought it looks awesome.

1366
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
And I just wish, though, that it was on the 360.

1367
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Because it'd be even more awesome.

1368
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
More awesomer?

1369
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Yeah. Actually, you know, I wish a lot of the games that they're putting on the Wii

1370
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
were on, like, the 360 or PS3.

1371
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Like, No More Heroes, Mad World.

1372
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Well, here's what's strange.

1373
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And, you know, again, here's a story that didn't really make show world tonight.

1374
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
It's just been a busy week.

1375
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
But there's rumors going around about the Wii HD again.

1376
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
And the successor to Nintendo Wii is coming out in 2011.

1377
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I don't know why this rumor has suddenly caught more steam.

1378
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And you know who I was looking at was being sourced for the rumor?

1379
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Get this.

1380
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
WhatTheyPlay.com was being sourced as, like, the start of the rumor, right?

1381
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Which, you know, just makes me think of WhatTheyPlay.com snap.

1382
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
The reason why is because people keep reporting the same rumor story,

1383
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
but people keep seeing the rumor story on multiple websites.

1384
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
It's like, Oh, my God, it's actually true.

1385
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
But it's actually all the same story.

1386
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
It's just some dude's opinion that used to work for 1UP.

1387
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Here's the other thing, too, is that it's, you know,

1388
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
will there be a follow-up to Wii?

1389
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Duh.

1390
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yes, of course there's going to be a follow-up to the Wii system.

1391
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I mean, the thing is sold millions and jillions.

1392
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Of course there's going to be a follow-up.

1393
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
It's just a question of when.

1394
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
So people like to pull dates out of their fucking butts as to when it's coming.

1395
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And, you know, if they're off, they'll just say, Oh, it just got delayed.

1396
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Or, Oh, they're putting it out early.

1397
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
It's just a bunch of crap.

1398
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Of course there's going to be a Wii follow-up.

1399
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Why is this news?

1400
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I saw it, like, on the front page of Yahoo as the successor to the Wii.

1401
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Who cares?

1402
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
When was that new?

1403
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
I know, for real.

1404
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Anyway, sorry.

1405
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It says, When is Yahoo known for reporting game news?

1406
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Look, I use their mail service, so I see the stuff on the page that they're saying.

1407
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I know.

1408
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I completely understand.

1409
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's just, you know, it was a little weird to me, that's all.

1410
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Especially since they're trying to sell some new video gaming news thing.

1411
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And, you know, if that's your cutting-edge story, I weep for the future.

1412
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Anyhow.

1413
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I weep all the time, anyway.

1414
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Nice.

1415
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Well, Nintendo points are not going to transfer between the Wii and the DSi.

1416
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
It is, um, official.

1417
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
They have their own points.

1418
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And let me guess, it'll be one of those things where I have to buy, you know, ten or twenty dollars worth of points at a time,

1419
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
and then the games will cost just enough so that I have, like, three hundred left over at any given time.

1420
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Yeah.

1421
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Correct?

1422
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,000
That's correct.

1423
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Well, basically, that pretty much is, yeah.

1424
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
But they have to be separate.

1425
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah.

1426
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It's totally impossible for a service to do that.

1427
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It's not like, you know, companies like Microsoft have, I don't know, Microsoft points that you can use on both Xbox Marketplace or, I don't know, the Zune Marketplace.

1428
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It's totally impossible.

1429
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
That technology does not exist.

1430
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
More like they just don't want to.

1431
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Of course they don't want to.

1432
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
That would be effort.

1433
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
It's just like effort in, I don't know, making, uh...

1434
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And less money from our money-making machines.

1435
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Making a unified online service for the Wii or the DS, or, I don't know, releasing games that aren't really ports.

1436
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Or innovating a little bit more than just your initial hardware.

1437
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Redertainment says in chat, it's like selling six hot dogs to a pack by eight buns to a pack.

1438
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Exactly.

1439
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
That's a perfect analogy.

1440
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Um, AlphaConanagram says it's all Nintendo points now.

1441
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
That's what I thought.

1442
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I thought it was gonna be all Nintendo points.

1443
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
It is all Nintendo points now.

1444
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,000
You know, once you put those Nintendo points in, like, you know, one place and you can't really do anything with them.

1445
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You're stuck.

1446
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Yeah, you can't name.

1447
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Because you have two different accounts.

1448
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Because, once again, there's no unified online service.

1449
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Grrr.

1450
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I'm surprised they don't have, you know, like, a friend code for the points or something like that that you gotta put in.

1451
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
You know, make sure that you can buy that game or something.

1452
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Or that you have to write with your stylus, all praise Nintendo.

1453
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Glory, glory, hallelujah.

1454
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I agree.

1455
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Do you wish to purchase said game?

1456
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Blue?

1457
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Blue?

1458
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
No!

1459
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
In fact, the DSi will actually have a place that will prick your finger for blood every time you, uh, actually want to get points.

1460
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Yeah, that's how you pay for the games.

1461
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
With your blood.

1462
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
With your soul.

1463
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
It's like, it's like, do you wish to purchase this game and relinquish your soul?

1464
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
What?

1465
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I just sold my soul for a donut.

1466
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yes.

1467
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Retertainment.

1468
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
That's perfect.

1469
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
You have to write every time.

1470
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Nintendo, lemming.

1471
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Bah, bah, bah.

1472
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Anyhow.

1473
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
You know what segment of ours has to follow a story like this.

1474
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

1475
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:27,000
My FU of the Week goes towards, um, you know what, I don't know that I have one for once.

1476
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Gasp.

1477
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
No.

1478
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
FU to your lack of angst?

1479
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Well, no, it's because I'm a Vicodin.

1480
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And Vicodin makes you not give a shit about anything.

1481
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Oh yeah, okay, I've got one.

1482
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Mr. Moron.

1483
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
FU to people.

1484
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Anyone who thinks I'm insulted by anything, anyone has to say about me.

1485
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Because that's obviously a sign that someone else has the issue, and I do not.

1486
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Don't come to my cubicle expecting me not to tell you to get out of my cubicle.

1487
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Because, okay, okay, the situation is that someone came into my cubicle, someone who I've had a problem doing this before,

1488
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:13,000
came and tried to talk to somebody on the other side of my cubicle, and I'm like, dude, please get out.

1489
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I need to, you know, do my work.

1490
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You're bugging me.

1491
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Get the hell away from me because I don't really like you that much either.

1492
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And he just started mumbling and just trying to say, you know, just really stupid insulting things.

1493
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And I got, you know what I did?

1494
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I laughed.

1495
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I just laughed.

1496
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I laughed so hard right there.

1497
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I was like, dude, you know how stupid you sound?

1498
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
And so he left and didn't bother me the rest of the day.

1499
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And that's just what I'm going to do from now on.

1500
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:47,000
If someone, anyone ever tries to just, you know, be mean, I'm just going to laugh.

1501
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That's all.

1502
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
My response from now on is going to be, aha.

1503
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I love this.

1504
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
The Raftian Chat says, I've seen her cubicle.

1505
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Much like you would expect from Dark Sakura, it's filled with pink fluffy clouds and is generally welcoming.

1506
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,000
The hell it is.

1507
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yeah, I killed him with laughter.

1508
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Because, I mean, basically, okay, keep in mind, I've had this problem before.

1509
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:21,000
And the whole reason that I think that people try to be insulting, especially when they're in the wrong, is to make themselves feel less wrong to put themselves in a position of superiority.

1510
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And this person has absolutely zero room.

1511
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
And I can say that in a completely unbiased fashion.

1512
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Yes, I do have the giant Tekken poster in my cubicle.

1513
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Thank you.

1514
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
That's what you say?

1515
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
No, I was answering that comment.

1516
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That I just, I just laughed.

1517
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I just laughed.

1518
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's like, how can someone say that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about when this is the same person that asks me how to copy cells in Excel?

1519
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Don't ask.

1520
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Control C, control V.

1521
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Exactly.

1522
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
SSG100 Matt says, you need to set up gun turrets at the entrance of your cubicle.

1523
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Actually, I was looking at ThinkGeek just a moment ago and they do have USB missile launchers.

1524
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Those are overrated.

1525
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Trust me, I have one at my desk.

1526
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
It's just retarded.

1527
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:12,000
It sits there for a second and goes eeeeeeee, pop, and then it goes boop, and like falls down a few feet away.

1528
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I could build a better rocket launcher.

1529
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
It was worth it just to hear Loki's expression.

1530
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And then it was like beep, and then it goes boop, and it's like boop.

1531
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
My cubicle drains the souls of other people and it gives them to me.

1532
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
They have a way to convert it into an airsoft gun.

1533
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Oh, Lord.

1534
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Alright, let's have you use the lead.

1535
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Any more, Dark Zyra.

1536
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Also, F you to me not having the money right now to buy the beaker coffee mug from ThinkGeek.

1537
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Alright, Loki.

1538
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:43,000
F you to myself for buying a magazine for my gun that's a double mag.

1539
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
The problem is because it's basically two magazines that are stuck next to each other when I plug it in,

1540
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
the other magazine covers the switch that allows me to pop the magazine out.

1541
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:59,000
So it makes it near impossible to take out the magazine once I put it in.

1542
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Doh! Should have paid attention.

1543
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Still love it though.

1544
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Alright, that it?

1545
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Also an F you to my Triton headphones I've got.

1546
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Already the left side, basically if you jiggle the cord a little bit, it will go out.

1547
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So that pisses me off because they were expensive.

1548
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
I want to give an F you to the pig fucker who stole the political sign from my front yard earlier this week,

1549
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
not even 24 hours after I placed it up.

1550
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
As you know, we have a very controversial proposition in the ballot here in California.

1551
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
They want to ban same-sex marriage and take rights away from people

1552
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:39,000
and treat certain people of this country differently than others, or of the state, I should say.

1553
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
This is a state proposition.

1554
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
And it's called Proposition 8.

1555
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
They're using scare tactics to do it which aren't even true.

1556
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
They are not going to tax churches.

1557
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
They're not going to force churches to marry people they don't want to marry.

1558
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Do atheists get married in church right now?

1559
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Do they force churches to marry people?

1560
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Can a non-Catholic get married in mass?

1561
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:01,000
They don't, I mean, when we were getting married and trying to have a Jewish wedding,

1562
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:10,000
you know, the female, what was it, the female, not priest, what's the word I'm looking for here?

1563
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Rabbi.

1564
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Rabbi.

1565
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Yes, the female rabbi, she's like, no, I don't want to marry a non-Jew and a Jew together.

1566
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I'm like, you're a fucking female rabbi.

1567
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
There's not supposed to be female rabbis, idiot.

1568
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Fucking contradictive.

1569
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Look, look, I don't want to turn this into something too political,

1570
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
but obviously I think this is the dumbest proposition of all propositions.

1571
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:38,000
And if you support, I guess, bigotry in the 21st century, then I guess you can go vote yes on it

1572
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
because that's all it is, is just, you know, it's hate and discrimination.

1573
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And like in the fucking year 2008, you wouldn't think that we would have to be fighting for these types of things

1574
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
that our grandparents fought for, but I guess history repeats itself, so what the fuck ever.

1575
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:57,000
But anyhow, obviously, for obvious reasons, a very staunch supporter of the No On 8 campaign,

1576
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
so I had a No On 8 sign in the front yard of my house, and it got stolen within 24 hours

1577
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
because that's just the kind of idiocy that's behind the support of this proposition,

1578
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:14,000
absolute moronism behind Proposition 8 that would steal a yard sign from the front of my house

1579
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
to make a goddamn point.

1580
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
The point you made was that you're an idiot, end of story.

1581
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
So guess what? I had a second sign waiting in the house, and I promptly put it up in its place.

1582
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
You should electrify it, Rob.

1583
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:29,000
The good idea was to rub it down on something sticky.

1584
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
By the way, Sauce pointed out to me, just for me to inform Loki,

1585
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
is that female rabbis are allowed in Reform Judaism.

1586
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Right, it depends what branch of the-

1587
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
They're allowed, I understand that, but the problem is, like, originally, they're not-

1588
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
That's why it's Reformed.

1589
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Exactly. But it's okay to also marry, you know, out of the religion, but it's just-

1590
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
They're just being stupid. It's like, oh, so this is okay, but it's not okay.

1591
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
What pisses me off, and I have to add to Rob's F.U., is just, um, like, uh, the, uh-

1592
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I haven't seen the commercials, but I've heard of them, and I've been told of the content of them.

1593
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
You know, I don't watch TV.

1594
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,000
You know, them saying all that bullshit is, like, they're trying to appeal to the stupid, pretty much.

1595
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
To the uninformed, to the ignorant.

1596
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
They're trying to scare people that we're gonna have to teach it in schools.

1597
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
That is complete nonsense.

1598
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
They don't teach.

1599
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Do you talk about regular marriage in schools?

1600
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Oh, come on, they don't even want to teach about heterosexual sex in school.

1601
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
For real. For real.

1602
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
So where the fuck do they get off?

1603
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
When, when hasn't a child been allowed to sit out of sex education?

1604
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It's just so ridiculous.

1605
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
You know what, if they-

1606
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:44,000
If you believe their lies, I'm sorry. I cannot hold back and play nice on this.

1607
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
If you believe this, you are an idiot.

1608
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Please unsubscribe from this show. We are too smart for you.

1609
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Seriously, I'm fucking serious.

1610
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And, I'll tell you what, if we get any emails to the point, you're not getting read.

1611
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You're, um, getting published.

1612
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Your email address is getting published.

1613
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I don't care, I'll do it.

1614
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Just bugs me.

1615
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Yep.

1616
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Sorry.

1617
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,000
This is war.

1618
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
But, you know, this is what I have to say, actually, Rob.

1619
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1620
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even though they're wrong.

1621
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
But not on this. I'm sorry.

1622
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:27,000
No, this, we have to be fair. This is America.

1623
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I understand, but at the same time, your rights stop where mine begin.

1624
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I agree. Now, this was my second point.

1625
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Is that, yes, you're allowed to disagree.

1626
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
You're allowed to have your belief.

1627
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
That is what this country was founded on.

1628
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Not God or religion, because Thomas Jefferson certainly, you know, didn't follow that.

1629
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
And he wrote our Declaration of Independence.

1630
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Fair enough.

1631
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:58,000
But my point is that everyone should be allowed to believe and feel what they want to believe and feel.

1632
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
They just have to also be equally tolerant of anyone who believes other than what they do.

1633
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Like, I tell everybody, be offended. Learn to be offended.

1634
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I'm having a hard time, Jamie.

1635
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Learn that someone is going to, but see, this is the problem is that we're dealing with people who aren't leaving it at that. We're dealing with people who are trying to force their point of view on other people and are, and have the majority, you know, view right now.

1636
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,000
All right. We're getting too much on the political topic, but.

1637
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:36,000
No, I firmly believe in, that we should be a more tolerant people.

1638
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Obviously, it's a very sensitive issue that I have a very strong and invested opinion in for obvious reasons.

1639
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So if I'm a little bit unhinged, I apologize to a point, but certainly you need to understand that when you are voting yes on this, you are saying my rights are not OK.

1640
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
And that's why I get so fucking incensed.

1641
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
There we go.

1642
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Sorry.

1643
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Anyhow, let's get back to the gaming news, shall we?

1644
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Yay, video games to make everything better and make us forget about what a fucked up world we live in. Right, Loki?

1645
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yes. In fact, totally off topic here, but Rogue Squadron could be coming back to the Nintendo consoles very soon, actually.

1646
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:41,000
According to rumor mill from EGM that LucasArts has licensed out the Rogue Squadron series for a Wii remake, and then basically instead of a brand new game, they're going to have a compilation of all the Nintendo 64 and GameCube titles on one disc.

1647
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Might be like one of those play on the Wii things.

1648
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,000
They were not bad. Those games are pretty good, so that'd be kind of cool.

1649
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Where is my lightsaber-wielding game?

1650
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Force Unleashed, the Clone Wars lightsaber duels.

1651
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,000
No, no, I mean like with the Wiimote and that whole thing. I guess there was the lightsaber duels thing.

1652
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Wii Sports Resort.

1653
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Oh yes, I forgot. Wii Sports Resort, OK.

1654
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Let me put it this way. I wouldn't want to see one until the Wii Motion Plus came out anyways, and even one that came out, I mean, they could port the arcade game. Remember the arcade game?

1655
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I love the arcade game. That was fun.

1656
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Yeah, so GS68 said almost at the exact same time in chat, Star Wars trilogy arcade games bonus rounds.

1657
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
There you go.

1658
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Alright, hey, one of the biggest websites of the past five years, or maybe of the past decade, I mean, who does not visit YouTube?

1659
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I mean, it's an awesome, awesome website. We even have some stuff up on YouTube. We haven't updated it in forever, but we have a YouTube channel with some of our old news broadcasts that were on there.

1660
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Who doesn't watch YouTube to catch up on some great clips from TV and Friends or whatever? This is an awesome site.

1661
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:59,000
And video games have really taken over on YouTube. I mean, heck, all these classic games of the week that Dark Soccer is reporting on, you can search for any of them on YouTube and look at clips of the game.

1662
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
And there's new game reviews and there's tons and tons of video game content out on YouTube.

1663
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Well now, what YouTube has decided they want to do, they're going to try to use this to profit.

1664
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Because right now, where does YouTube make a profit? There's not a lot of advertising on the site.

1665
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
It's very interesting that considering they don't sell much on YouTube, they still manage to make money.

1666
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Well, they're going to try to take that one step further and it's going to start with some of the music based on EMI music and Universal.

1667
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Well now, it's also going to be video games made by EA. So apparently, when you go like, let's say you visit a YouTube of a game made from EA, you'll be able to buy the game right there.

1668
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So there you go. It's kind of neat. And then YouTube will get a cut of the game sales. So YouTube will sell you games. There you go.

1669
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:53,000
That's a good tie-in. I mean, it's kind of a duh. I'm kind of surprised it didn't really happen before.

1670
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:04,000
But I'm curious, what about the retro games? Those are a little harder to find. But maybe eBay links or something. Who knows? Or links to used game stores, I guess.

1671
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:13,000
There you have it. YouTube. I wonder if soon you'll be able to buy DVDs of TV shows that you see on YouTube.

1672
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Or like, you know, like, TV for chocolate rain.

1673
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I hardly ever buy things on the internet anyway. Very rare. I like to go in the store and have it in my hand. There's something to be said for that.

1674
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Some things you can't buy in stores.

1675
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Well, whatever.

1676
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
You can buy happiness in a store.

1677
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I cannot buy happiness in a store.

1678
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I do all the time.

1679
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Is your mic on? You're very quiet for some reason.

1680
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Yes, it is on.

1681
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
There we go. Now I hear you.

1682
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Dun dun dun.

1683
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Alright, sorry. Moving on.

1684
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Well, there is a bit more happy news. Why is it that I'm just getting all the happy news, Rob?

1685
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I don't know. I just, I knew you'd be on Vicodin tonight, so you just want to be happy happy.

1686
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
You'd rather give me stuff, because you know if I don't care about something else, I don't care about it.

1687
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But this is very, very, very happy news.

1688
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,000
For Street Fighter IV home releases, there's been another female character confirmed.

1689
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And it's Sakura! I'm very happy.

1690
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
And I watched video of it, actually, today, Rob.

1691
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And she's there in her full kickass glory, so I'm quite thrilled with that.

1692
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But she was confirmed, actually, to Famitsu by Yoshinori Ono that she was going to definitely be in the home version.

1693
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
And there's also going to be a few more things in the home version, including a training mode.

1694
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Now, even though this Sakura isn't where you get your name, contrary to popular belief, you're still pretty excited about this, right?

1695
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1696
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I actually, after there came out Dark Sakura from Marvel Superheroes vs. Street Fighter, I actually adopted her as my online avatar for a while.

1697
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Cute.

1698
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oh, I remember that. Way back in the day on the Sacramento's DDR forum, your little avatar was Dark Sakura, the actual one.

1699
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But I had taken the picture from the ending of Rival Schools and did the sunburnt look to her and made her sailor dress black and make her red eyes.

1700
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Cool. Very cool.

1701
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Early photoshopping before I had photoshopped.

1702
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Well, I think we're all going to be playing Street Fighter IV. I'm excited about that game.

1703
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Heck yeah.

1704
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I wish it was out by Christmas, but then again, I also don't.

1705
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
I wish it was out by right now.

1706
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I also kind of don't because I need my games to be spaced out right about now because I'm still trying to work on Silent Hill Homecoming.

1707
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And then I've got World of Warcraft going on, which by the way, I deemed 50 on my alt. Thank you very much.

1708
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I will have you know though that, what was it, Street Fighter IV is supposed to be coming out around the time as the brand new Street Fighter movie.

1709
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Awesome. That'll give you a nice fresh taste in your mouth.

1710
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Anyways, Guitar Hero. World Tour is right around the corner, only a few weeks away.

1711
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And with that is going to be some brand new download content available for the game.

1712
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:09,000
They're going to have a classic rock track pack filled with a bunch of different things, including Rock and Roll Band by Boston, Hot-Blooded by Foreigner, and Jessie's Girl by Rick Springfield.

1713
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Awesome.

1714
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And then also they're going to have a few more tracks, Blind Melons, No Rain.

1715
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Dear God, I hate that song.

1716
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
What? I love that song.

1717
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Which is in Rock Band too right now.

1718
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Overplayed?

1719
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Aww.

1720
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
A couple...

1721
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
No wait, Blind Melon isn't in Rock Band 2 are they?

1722
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
No Rain I think is in there.

1723
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I don't think it is. No, I don't think it is. I would have bought that shit if it was. I actually like that song.

1724
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I thought it was. Well, whatever.

1725
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Anyways, oh no, I'm thinking Grand Theft Auto. I'm sorry. It's in Grand Theft Auto's radio thing.

1726
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Aha.

1727
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Anyways, R.E.M. is going to have a few tunes on there.

1728
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Horse to Water, Man's Size Wreath, and Supernatural Superserious.

1729
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Supernatural Superserious?

1730
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Yeah.

1731
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,000
God, they never put in the one R.E.M. song I'd like to have in there.

1732
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Which is?

1733
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Don't Fall On Me.

1734
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
What album was that on?

1735
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
It was on Document I think.

1736
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I'm disappointed to see that they don't have some of the Phil Collins stuff in there.

1737
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Like the ones where it's...

1738
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Was it Hold On I guess?

1739
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
We need Land of Confusion.

1740
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
I am just very excited to get to play Rick Springfield in Guitar Hero.

1741
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
That is going to be all kinds of awesome.

1742
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Guitar Hero World Tour, although I don't think I'm going to have the whole setup of my house.

1743
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I'll play along with the charade, that doesn't seem to be a reason to change.

1744
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
You know I feel so dirty when they start...

1745
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Awesome.

1746
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Let me see if I can get the game only version, but I know I'm not buying another...

1747
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I'll probably get the...

1748
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I want the guitar.

1749
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I want the new guitar and I want the game.

1750
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
But that's it.

1751
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I don't need the drums and all that other shit.

1752
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Hey, Rock Band's getting some new stuff too.

1753
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And if you like Motley Crue, this is going to be your week.

1754
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Because this is the week that you're getting Dr. Feelgood, the album.

1755
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Sweet.

1756
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
That is all kinds of awesome.

1757
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
What's that?

1758
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Was that the one that had Don't Go Away Mad?

1759
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Well, no.

1760
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Damn.

1761
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Oh no it does, yeah it does.

1762
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
That would be my favorite Motley Crue song.

1763
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Don't Go Away Mad, Just Go Away.

1764
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I mean it has fucking Dr. Feelgood.

1765
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
This song is all kinds of awesome.

1766
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Great album.

1767
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
He's the one that got Dr. Feelgood.

1768
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Anyway, Slice of Your Pie, Rattlesnake Shake, Kickstart My Heart.

1769
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Lots and lots and lots of good songs coming out.

1770
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
No other random songs announced yet.

1771
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Those are the only ones they've announced so far.

1772
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
There might be...

1773
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Sometimes there's been like little random offerings from other bands that show up as well with the albums.

1774
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
But nothing so far this week.

1775
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Stephen Colbert songs.

1776
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Did Stephen Colbert have any other songs?

1777
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
We need Singing in Korean on there.

1778
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Or I want to see more South Park songs.

1779
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Or more DVDA stuff.

1780
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
They should be doing...

1781
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
They Might Be Giants.

1782
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
And more Jonathan Coulton.

1783
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
We'll see.

1784
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I love School Crusher Mountain, but I could totally use Ikea.

1785
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Like we need America Fuck Yeah.

1786
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Or the montage song.

1787
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Gonna need a montage.

1788
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Alright, let's get into the Journey to the Wonderland song.

1789
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Because this song is awesome and it always means...

1790
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It's mailbag time!

1791
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Every week you send this mail at email...

1792
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm sorry, at mailbag at orangelaunchready.com.

1793
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Dark Sakura goes into the mailbag and reads her favorite emails.

1794
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Unfortunately, since there was no show and ended up getting posted on the feed last week, I believe we have Slim Pickens tonight.

1795
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Three emails.

1796
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Let's hear them.

1797
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
This one comes from Robert M.

1798
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Note, I am not able to get into chat for some reason.

1799
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,000
If this topic has already been discussed on tonight's show, please do not trouble yourself with reading this on the air.

1800
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I also missed last week's show and haven't gotten the podcast for same yet.

1801
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Topic is Lord British in space. Best thing ever. Discuss.

1802
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
That would be freaking rad.

1803
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Has he launched yet?

1804
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I knew he was a private citizen that was going to be going.

1805
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Like he's one of the famous...

1806
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
He bought the Russian space tourist thing and I'd heard about that.

1807
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
But I didn't know if he'd actually gone yet.

1808
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
See, I was thinking of Gradius.

1809
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It's supposed to happen this year at some point.

1810
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I was thinking of Gradius in Salamander.

1811
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
So that's why I said best thing ever.

1812
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
If he's got a little ship, that would be great.

1813
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Umm...

1814
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
An Ultima game in space.

1815
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
But really, this is basically civilian in space, right?

1816
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Yes, except the civilian in question happens to be a famous game designer.

1817
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Seriously. I actually think that it would be a very good thing, I think, to have more civilians.

1818
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,000
You know, to be able to have that go through.

1819
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Because that just puts us that much closer to colonizing the moon.

1820
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
And then...

1821
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Space monkeys.

1822
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I'm sorry, I was looking at the little iPhone game that John has.

1823
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
The space monkey game.

1824
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Space monkeys.

1825
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
We need space monkeys.

1826
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Next one, shall we?

1827
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Sure, next email.

1828
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
This one comes from Rob with Two Bees.

1829
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I don't know if this is an old story, but I found it on Dig.

1830
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Most of the myths debunked are the media effects on children.

1831
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
There's one myth I have, personal debunking knowledge.

1832
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
And that's whether...

1833
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Because gamers are used to train soldiers to kill.

1834
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
No, games are being used to train soldiers to kill.

1835
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And they have the same impact on kids who play them.

1836
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
They used to work in trainers and simulators for the army.

1837
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
And they're not even close to the games we play.

1838
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Even when they use the same basic software, it's modded for realism and specific training goals.

1839
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,000
And he says he has the same shirt in the stock photo in the article.

1840
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,000
I'm pulling up the article because I'd actually like to go over it.

1841
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
If you don't mind.

1842
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Sure.

1843
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
The availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence.

1844
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Which actually says that we're at a 30 year low. Like, I had brought that up before a while back, right?

1845
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I believe so.

1846
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Scientific evidence links violent gameplay to youth aggression.

1847
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:23,000
And that's actually saying that claims like this are the work of researchers who represent one relatively narrow school of research, media effects.

1848
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
The research includes some 300 studies of media violence.

1849
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,000
But most of these studies are inconclusive and many have been criticized on methodical grounds.

1850
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
So, I'm sorry. Methodological grounds.

1851
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Children are the primary market for video games.

1852
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:44,000
And actually the center of the video game market is actually older teen to adult.

1853
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Almost no girls play computer games. Bullshit!

1854
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:56,000
And five was the one that Rob said in his email because it's to train soldiers to kill and that's no.

1855
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Dude, even anyone should know that.

1856
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Six video games are not a meaningful form of expression.

1857
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I love this one and it was also my birthday.

1858
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:16,000
On April 19, 2002, US District Judge Steven and Lembal Sr. will the video games do not convey ideas and thus enjoy no constitutional protection.

1859
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
As evidence, St. Louis County presented the judge with videotaped excerpts from four games.

1860
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
All within a narrow range of genre and all the subject of previous controversy.

1861
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Overturning a similar decision in Indianapolis Federal Court of Appeals, Judge Richard Posner noted,

1862
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive theme of both culture, high and low.

1863
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:46,000
It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm Anderson and Perrault are aware.

1864
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,000
To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be chaotic,

1865
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:01,000
excuse me, deforming, it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.

1866
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
That is, that's beautiful.

1867
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I mean, so basically, in a nutshell, you can't go shielding your children from every violent and terrible thing that's going to happen.

1868
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
They're not going to have any frame of reference for when they're an adult.

1869
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And trust me, I know people who are like this.

1870
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:29,000
There's a, one of my, I guess it's more of a, someone I know through a friend, but she was never allowed to watch the news,

1871
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:34,000
never allowed to read anything but what her mother let her read, you know, that type of thing.

1872
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And she's very, very ill prepared for her life now. I mean, to the point of about to lose her children, so.

1873
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And if kids don't know how to deal with a zombie infestation now, what's going to happen when it really does happen?

1874
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Seriously.

1875
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
The other one on here was video game play is socially isolating.

1876
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And the first sentence is, much video game play is social. Almost 60% of frequent gamers play with friends.

1877
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:06,000
33% play with siblings and 25% play with spouses or parents.

1878
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:16,000
8. Video game play is desensitizing. And, no. It's not.

1879
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:21,000
The Rob D. has a very funny comment in chat there. It says video game play is isolating.

1880
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:24,000
That's why I'm in a chat room with 40 other people and I've met a lot of them.

1881
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Talking about the various conventions and stuff.

1882
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Exactly.

1883
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Funny. Funny.

1884
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:35,000
So, just more goes to show that, you know, there's idiots in power.

1885
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So, another email?

1886
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Yes. Last one.

1887
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Actually from the Rob D.

1888
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Alrighty.

1889
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
What's up, OLR hosts? Back at PAX.

1890
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Amongst the random conversation between bites of delicious food at Wild Ginger,

1891
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I mentioned that while I have friends that are into video games, I have no friends that are willing to make a podcast with me.

1892
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:59,000
That got me thinking. You've talked about the origins of OLR before, but were you all willing to give it a try right away?

1893
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:07,000
As I recall, a couple of you had had previous radio experience, so that probably delayed a few of your initial worries about starting your own internet radio show.

1894
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Still, did any of you have to be talked into it?

1895
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
One of us just showed up every show until we said, fine, you can join.

1896
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Yeah. Loki just kind of showed up, but that was cool.

1897
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:26,000
That was originally what it was supposed to be, is it was like the weekly gathering of people to talk about, you know, games, and specifically DDR back in the day of OLR's origins.

1898
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Let's continue. Did you imagine you'd still be doing it after all of this time?

1899
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
No.

1900
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Yes. I thought we would.

1901
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
After this long...

1902
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I'm stubborn.

1903
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Since Understation Live ended, for me, I mean, obviously it's still going, but since it ended for me because of Travis' move, no, I didn't think this show would outlast Understation Live.

1904
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:52,000
I really didn't. But we've all, you're right, we've all been kind of stubborn and haven't gone anywhere.

1905
01:47:52,000 --> 01:48:00,000
You know, we're still here in SAC and although our lives have all gone through significant changes, certainly, nobody's really left or, you know what I mean?

1906
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:07,000
So, I felt that I would keep, I would at least keep broadcasting in some way or another. That was...

1907
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Honestly, I think that's part of the reason why Orange Laundry was started in the first place.

1908
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:15,000
So, no, none of us had to be talked into it because you hit the nail on the head, we all kind of were doing it anyway.

1909
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So, it was kind of like a chance for us to kind of talk about something.

1910
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:27,000
You know, I don't want to say that we wanted to talk about because we certainly had that outlet on Understation Live, but maybe something different that we felt we had a lot more to say, if that makes sense.

1911
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I think it's kind of where this started.

1912
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Well, to continue, if I may.

1913
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Sure.

1914
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I was going to say, you may. Sorry. I've been listening to Rocky.

1915
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:38,000
You may.

1916
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:43,000
When did you know it was something that you wanted to continue doing?

1917
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I think it was just sort of, we just sort of kept doing it. I mean, it's not a conscious decision. Are we going to keep doing OLR?

1918
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I think the moment that we had 12 listeners the first night and we were like, cool, somebody is actually listening to this.

1919
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I think we've grown since the 12 listeners.

1920
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
A little bit, thanks to podcasting. Just a little bit, yeah.

1921
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Finally, were there any people you asked to host OLR that didn't want to do it?

1922
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:15,000
In other words, are there any lost OLR hosts or hosts that could have been?

1923
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
No, it was always going to be Jamie and I.

1924
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:22,000
And then Loki came on after, you know, because he was so involved and so into it and was doing so much.

1925
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
I mean, it would be stupid not to add him, obviously.

1926
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Rob and I had a meeting.

1927
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I can't picture the show without him all these years later, honestly.

1928
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Rob and I actually did have a meeting.

1929
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Yes.

1930
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
And we were like, should we just make Loki a host?

1931
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Yeah, that's pretty much how it went.

1932
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And lo and behold.

1933
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:44,000
No, the idea, the concept kind of formed between Jamie and I and that's where it is.

1934
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
There was no really other host considered.

1935
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Guests, people, I think you've pretty much heard everybody we've wanted to have on the show.

1936
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
I want Igarashi.

1937
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Well, I mean, you know what I mean, like local-wise and local other DDR peeps.

1938
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
We need to get Dan back on the show.

1939
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Yeah.

1940
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Okay, next paragraph.

1941
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
By the way, I just want to say real quick.

1942
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
We also got another email in.

1943
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,000
VXChaseXV in chats, who's obviously been following us a long, long time, says the podcast specifically,

1944
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:18,000
podcasting into the main show, I think that was when it really hit the ground running.

1945
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
OLR moved on from just Bomani to video games that don't suck and podcasting.

1946
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
That was the real time.

1947
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I admit, even the show does seem to have a different feel to it now, but it's a natural evolution.

1948
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,000
We got older.

1949
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
We actually have a bit more structure.

1950
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:36,000
We didn't really talk about news much when we started.

1951
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
We just were pretty much talked about whatever we wanted to.

1952
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I had a migraine the first show, so I didn't know if that was any kind of sign.

1953
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I was sitting in that chair with ice on my head.

1954
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Before they made Head On, there was ice on.

1955
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Nice.

1956
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
But next paragraph.

1957
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Also, what did you think about the Mega Man 9 downloadable content?

1958
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:04,000
On one hand, I will buy it and love that we're finally going to be able to play as Proto Man.

1959
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:11,000
On the other hand, things like the endless stage and the special stage make me worried that things we used to take for granted as unlockables,

1960
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
extra stages, and characters are now being turned into pay-as-you-go items.

1961
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I know gaming is a business, and I appreciate that Capcom is in tune with the fans to put Proto Man in the game.

1962
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I wish it didn't have to come at my expense.

1963
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Thanks, Rob D.

1964
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
P.S. Looks like I'll have to buy OE for Tatunoko vs. Capcom.

1965
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Sad. I can't pass it up.

1966
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Rob hit the nail on the head that this is kind of where we're seeing the industry going,

1967
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
is that now we're having to pay for things we used to just unlock for fun, which is sad.

1968
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
But I can't give an opinion on the Mega Man 9 download content because I haven't got it.

1969
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
There's still unlockables.

1970
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
There are, but you know what I mean.

1971
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Rob, try the Proto Man thing. It's fun.

1972
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I do. I want to check it out.

1973
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Or as he was originally called, blues.

1974
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Rob's apologizing for the long email.

1975
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Don't apologize.

1976
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
It was actually fun. It was a little bit retro.

1977
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It gave us time to get another email.

1978
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
It did. Alright, quickly. I told somebody we'd be calling them in ten minutes.

1979
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Okay. It's actually from Sauce.

1980
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Sweet.

1981
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,000
It's a game review.

1982
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
We can make time for Sauce.

1983
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Yeah.

1984
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Hello all. A month after the Nintendo DS game Dragon Quest IV Chapters of the Chosen was released,

1985
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I finally had the chance to finish playing through the game and give it a somewhat in-depth review.

1986
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Please. I want to know more about this, actually.

1987
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I wound up playing the original Dragon Quest IV and then Chapters of the Chosen back to back

1988
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:31,000
in order to compare the remake to the original, so I would better appreciate what the remake has to offer.

1989
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Overall, the game is as close to perfect as a classic RPG can be.

1990
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
It's definitely worth checking out for those who have played the original Dragon Quest IV

1991
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:43,000
and those who have never played the game before alike.

1992
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,000
As always, the full review can be found on my blog at AvengersTower.com

1993
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
or through my Twitter, Mar and Marvel.

1994
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Keep up the great job, OLR.

1995
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
I look forward to coming out to Sacramento again soon to see you all again.

1996
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
And that's from Mar.

1997
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Yay! Whatever happened to her moving here?

1998
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
And I'm going to copy the link in the chat.

1999
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Is that still something that might happen?

2000
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I hope. I wish.

2001
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I hope so too.

2002
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It must happen.

2003
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Alright. We'll see. One of us. One of us.

2004
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Alright. Let's move on. We've got some BlizzCon news.

2005
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Yes.

2006
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
By the way, if you want to email us, mailbagorangelunchrated.com.

2007
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Some news coming out of BlizzCon.

2008
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Yes. First thing that came out of BlizzCon was the new class revealed for Diablo III.

2009
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
New class is Wizard.

2010
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Wizard!

2011
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Yes.

2012
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Please tell me the game will say,

2013
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Blue Wizard is about to die.

2014
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Wrong game.

2015
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Aw, dammit.

2016
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,000
But the wizard is blue.

2017
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Actually, the wizard was yellow and gauntlet, but never mind.

2018
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
The wizard is blue in this one.

2019
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Oh, okay. Well, cool.

2020
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Anyways, they didn't really say exactly too much about it other than the wizard can hurl lightning, can channel explosive arcane energies.

2021
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,000
It's a fucking wizard! What else do you need to know? I mean, seriously.

2022
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
It's a fucking wizard.

2023
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I mean, is it suddenly going to have a sword and shield? No, it's a wizard. Magic. End.

2024
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Right?

2025
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
It would be a red wizard that would have a sword and shield there.

2026
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Shut up.

2027
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Yeah, that's it.

2028
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
There you go.

2029
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Well, also some other news about Diablo III. You know, people have been begging Blizzard to put World of Warcraft on consoles.

2030
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:32,000
And what's interesting about Diablo III and some of the news that's come out about Diablo III is that possibly it could be coming to consoles.

2031
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I guess this was based off a very veiled comment that came out of BlizzCon, but you know what? Take it with a grain of salt.

2032
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:45,000
It's probably not going to happen right away. Because what was the last thing Blizzard did on a console?

2033
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:51,000
The Viking game, right? And then Starcraft Ghost got aborted, so there really wasn't anything else.

2034
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
So Diablo III consoles? Probably not for a long time, folks.

2035
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
By the way, some other little tidbits out of BlizzCon.

2036
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
You will soon be able to use your mounts in the water in a future World of Warcraft patch.

2037
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Right now, if you try to run across a river on your mount, you will automatically dismount.

2038
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,000
And now your mounts will apparently work in the water, so you can try to drown your horse. Isn't that nice?

2039
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
There you have it.

2040
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:20,000
By the way, to hear some other things about BlizzCon, we're actually going to get an old OLR buddy here on the phone who is actually at BlizzCon.

2041
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
We want to talk to them about their experience at BlizzCon, so we're giving them a call right now.

2042
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
One ringy dingy.

2043
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Two ringy dingys.

2044
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Hopefully he answers the phone.

2045
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Hello, is this Extopher?

2046
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Yes.

2047
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Hello, Extopher. How are you?

2048
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I'm fine, and you?

2049
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Ah, my mom.

2050
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Why? Why?

2051
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Because I didn't go to BlizzCon like you, you asshole.

2052
01:55:52,000 --> 01:56:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you know, I don't know what to do for that, but I did, so whatever.

2053
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Alright, well, how was BlizzCon? Tell us about the trip. What did you do? How was it? You know, walk us through your experience at BlizzCon.

2054
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Well, it was pretty cool. We got there a day before it started, and we picked up our bags, and it was kind of confusing how to pick up our goody bags.

2055
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Once we did, we got back to our hotel, kind of looked at it all, and there was a lot of stuff that was in there that they didn't list on the website, actually.

2056
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:41,000
They gave us a bunch of, everybody got a free authenticator that was BlizzCon's theme, so it has like a BlizzCon logo on it and everything.

2057
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Wait, you got a free authenticator? You fucker.

2058
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Well, yeah, we all got that.

2059
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry.

2060
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:50,000
What was that?

2061
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry, go ahead.

2062
01:56:53,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Oh, okay, I hate you too. So, yeah, and then we got there in the morning the next day, and pretty much watched the panels.

2063
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,000
We waited in line at the BlizzCon store for three hours before we got to the front of it.

2064
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Oh my God, what was so important that you had to get?

2065
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Well, I wanted a shirt, and Annie, my sister, wanted also a shirt and one of their little messenger bags that they have.

2066
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:40,000
So, yeah, we waited really long for that, and then Jim, my brother-in-law, got my sister a Murloc, which was a big collectible thing this year, I guess.

2067
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:50,000
And so, it was pretty fun. There was a lot of panels, a lot of exciting, like, new things that we got to see.

2068
01:57:50,000 --> 01:58:03,000
We got to see walkthroughs of four of the dungeons, and we also got to see Jay Moore again this year, which was fun.

2069
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I like that comment from Redertainment in chat right now. He says, I waited three hours and all I got was this fucking shirt.

2070
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
I know, that's what I said.

2071
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:28,000
What were some of the awesome things that happened at the panels? We talked about some of the news already a little bit on the show, how you can use your mounts and water, you'll be able to on one of the patches, but, like, what was something that happened at the panels that got a huge response from the crowd?

2072
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I think that, just, I don't know, like, it's very general, because a lot of things got big responses.

2073
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:48,000
When I was at the panels in particular, I was at the dungeons and raids panel, I was at half of the PVP panel.

2074
01:58:48,000 --> 01:59:01,000
And I think that class balance is really a big issue on a lot of people's minds, is how are they going to balance the classes, especially with the Death Knights being the big, like, new class.

2075
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:20,000
And they kind of really validated everybody's concerns, which I think made everyone happy, and so I think everything that they said, every answer that they gave that had to do with class balance was particularly, like, good to hear for a lot of people.

2076
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I don't know if we mentioned it on this show yet tonight, but I think we were talking about it a little bit with Bobby when we were doing the tease on the Bobby Black Wolf show before us here on All Games Radio, we were mentioning that some guy had a Diablo 3 shirt that actually worked for Blizzard that had, like, unicorns and rainbows on it, and it was a Diablo 3 shirt.

2077
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Did you see that shirt?

2078
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Yeah.

2079
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I won it.

2080
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:59,000
No, I didn't see the shirt, but there was a funny thing that happened. During the closing ceremony, they actually showed that on the big screen. Like, they were making fun of Diablo 3, and then they showed it, and everybody just, like, lost it. It was crazy.

2081
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Awesome.

2082
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:01,000
But, yeah, it was fun.

2083
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Speaking of Diablo 3...

2084
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
By the way...

2085
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Go ahead.

2086
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Go ahead.

2087
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Oh, I was gonna say, Patton Oswalt was incredibly funny. Like, he is great to see in person. Like, everybody loved him.

2088
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Did he make a bunch of WoW jokes or something? Call you all nerds?

2089
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:35,000
No, he actually, he's never played WoW in his life, but he put people down for making fun of him for that, and it was great. He, like, played off of the audience, like, so well, and he had a bunch of geek jokes, and he was not censored, which was great, so...

2090
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Did you get to put your hands on any of the games that were on the floor? Because you had, like, Diablo 3, Starcraft 2.

2091
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Yeah.

2092
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
What'd you play?

2093
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Well, last year I played Starcraft 2, and I'm not a big, like, real-time strategy, like, type of person, so I thought it was fine for what it was, but I did get a chance this year to play Diablo 3, and I was sold.

2094
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Like, it's definitely really fun. I've never played Diablo in my life before that, and it was absolutely wonderful. I definitely recommend it when it comes out.

2095
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Well, it's not even anywhere near finished yet, which makes it, like, even more incredible to me.

2096
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
What was the demo like? Like, what did you get to do in the demo?

2097
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Well, you could choose your class, which there's only three playable classes right now, and after that you go into this, like, dungeon-y area, and basically my sister and my brother-in-law, we, all three of us, grouped up into a party, and we all three, like, just had fun, just kind of, like, mashing the buttons and seeing what abilities we could, you know, use or whatever.

2098
02:01:40,000 --> 02:02:05,000
None of us had played the game before, so we didn't really know how to control it, so we were kind of noobs learning for the first time, but it was actually surprisingly easy, and there's a lot of different, like, creepy little enemies, and, I don't know, they're all, like, skeletal, and there's a lot of blood in it, and I don't know, it's like a dungeon-y type place.

2099
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Awesome. Well, any other, like, what would you say was the best thing about BlizzCon?

2100
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:28,000
The best thing this year about BlizzCon was the contest ceremony. Jay Moore absolutely killed it, and I don't care if you don't like Jay Moore, I think he was hilarious, and he actually created a lot of new fans that night.

2101
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:53,000
And the actual dance contest was just the best, like, they had an undead female dance that, like, I don't know what it was, it, like, mesmerized everybody, just, the whole audience, like, went crazy, like, 5,000-whatever people that were in there were just, like, all cheering for this girl, so it was pretty cool.

2102
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Well, we have some questions from the chat room that I want to ask you. Retertainment is asking, did someone ask Jay Moore if his show was cancelled?

2103
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:12,000
You know, nobody got to ask Jay Moore anything, but I'm sure he'll have a cancelled show within the next few weeks or so.

2104
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:20,000
DJ Dark Knight wants to know, did you go to any of the tournaments that were going on?

2105
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:44,000
We wanted to, but there was so much going on that we actually didn't. I kind of kept up to date on what was going on with the arena tournaments by looking on WoW Insider, like with my phone, which was kind of cool because I guess there was a huge upset this year, but it was, as far as I know, the area looked really cool, we got to walk by a few times.

2106
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Nice. Shahran, speaking of your phone, actually wants to know, how's your iPhone?

2107
02:03:50,000 --> 02:04:01,000
It freaking rocks, I guess. I don't know. It's okay. I'm kind of over the iPhone, actually. I keep on telling people that I might actually switch to a different phone in November.

2108
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Why?

2109
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I don't know.

2110
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Really?

2111
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:14,000
It's high maintenance, you know, you have to constantly clean it, and I don't know, I'm always worried that the screen is going to get scratched.

2112
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Whatever, you're just talking smack about it because I finally bought one this week.

2113
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:22,000
I know, and look at me trying to make you feel bad.

2114
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Last question, Dark Tetsuya wants to know if the Wizard was playable in Diablo 3.

2115
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:40,000
It was, and I actually played the Wizard, and it was really fun. I was very impressed. Once again, having not ever played the game before, I was thoroughly impressed by it.

2116
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:52,000
At least for anybody that hasn't played the game before, I definitely recommend it, and from what I hear, most fans of Diablo are definitely going to want to play this.

2117
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Alright, really quickly, then we're going to let you go, because this phone call is going on ten minutes, but I want to know, did you meet other, because it's a convention, it's a meet and meet people, did you meet any other funny people?

2118
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Were there some really weird ass people that you actually got to meet?

2119
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Well, there were weird ass people, but tell you the truth, Rob, I don't want to meet any of those weird fuckers.

2120
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Wasn't there somebody you were looking at from a distance going, that guy is, like, fucking weird?

2121
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Yeah, especially the people that ask questions on the panels, like, they're the best, they're like, I'm a nerd, and I'm like, did he even ask a question? I don't know, do they speak different languages? What the hell?

2122
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Alright, well, hey, Extrofer, we gotta let you go so we can get back to our show, but thanks for the report on Blizzcon, and maybe next year I can go.

2123
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Maybe, who knows?

2124
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:53,000
We'll see, alright, well, take care, Extrofer, and come join us in the studio sometime.

2125
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Alright, I will, definitely.

2126
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Alright, later, dude.

2127
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Alright, bye.

2128
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:17,000
Extrofer joining us, not live, from Blizzcon, but at least he was there, so he was able to give us a call, which, by the way, while Blizzcon was going on, some friends of mine, and me, held our own little convention called QQCon, for those of us that weren't able to get tickets to Blizzcon, so it was pretty awesome, actually.

2129
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:23,000
We actually had goodie bags from QQCon, and one of the things we got was a little rabbit's foot for better luck next year, so there you have it.

2130
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Alright, let's move on and get to some more gaming news, and then we'll get to the Skype line so the rest of y'all can call in, and we'll start off Dark Sakura, going to a new game.

2131
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:40,000
For anyone who is interested in Call of Duty, Call of Duty 5 is going into beta next week for Xbox 360.

2132
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Well, I should actually say, this week.

2133
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:50,000
There will be some sources that are giving out beta codes, you just have to find them.

2134
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:54,000
I just thought it was worth saying that Activision is starting testing now.

2135
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Cool. Kind of like last year, they did the same thing with Call of Duty 4.

2136
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I remember I got into the beta last year, we only played it a few times.

2137
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I know that Eurogamer is giving out beta codes, so for our friends overseas, you can find it there.

2138
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Yeah. Hmm. Very cool.

2139
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Anyways, let's see here. Something back to the music gaming topic here.

2140
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:27,000
There's a brand new music game that's going to make some competition for Beatmania and Activision's new DJ hero.

2141
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That is Scratch, the ultimate DJ, being announced. It's kind of a partnership of both Newmark and hip-hop producer Quincy Jones III.

2142
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Genius Products is going to be distributing it, and Genco Interactive, I believe, is developing it.

2143
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:56,000
The game itself is very similar to Beatmania, in fact the screen basically involves

2144
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:02,000
five colored notes scrolling down the screen, and they've got a section where you can scratch as well.

2145
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
There's going to be a controller that they're making for it.

2146
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Actually, Newark is making the controller, and overall, it looks pretty cool so far.

2147
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:18,000
We'll have to see more of a song list and that kind of thing, but maybe set the bar a little bit high for a DJ hero whenever that comes out.

2148
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
But this, I don't know, looks pretty cool.

2149
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:26,000
ActDeft in chat gives a mandatory comment. Konami will sue! Will they? Yeah, they may.

2150
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:32,000
They may sue, and you know what, that's pretty sad because their attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.

2151
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And this is J100Matt says, how can they not be sued for this?

2152
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Because the interface is different. I mean, it is a similar type of gameplay, but depends on how you play it.

2153
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:51,000
I mean, it's just like how Guitar Hero is different enough to where they can't really sue.

2154
02:08:51,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Well, I guess, they license the rights for the guitars, but as far as the actual game itself, I don't think they have to license anything.

2155
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:11,000
So, it's different enough, the way the notes come on the screen, because they kind of come out, it looks like there's a record that's playing that is spinning,

2156
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:16,000
and then the notes come out of the spinning record and then scroll down the screen, like a conveyor belt.

2157
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:22,000
FYI, VXChasingXV argues with you and says, Konami's attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.

2158
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:26,000
15 versions in Japan, their US attempt was great, it's just the wrong locale.

2159
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I'm talking about the US one, and yeah, it was alright, but what did they really do with it?

2160
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Nothing. So, you know what, if you're not going to do anything with your product that could probably sell very well,

2161
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:48,000
much like Guitar Freaks was, then you deserve to be left in the dust, I guess.

2162
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Just like putting out a guitar game and a drum game years after everyone else has attempted it. Not probably a smart idea.

2163
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I reluctantly agree, I have no patience for Konami in the music game world anymore.

2164
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
If they're not going to do it, someone else needs to beat them to it.

2165
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Although I thought Beatmania in the US was fine, it was alright.

2166
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Well, let's look at DDR. What exactly has changed in DDR lately? Not much.

2167
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:20,000
How have they supported their games with downloadable content? Not very well.

2168
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I mean, the quest mode in that game, in the universe games have sucked,

2169
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:33,000
and they don't really listen to their fanbase anymore, they just kind of do what they want because they're DDR and people will buy it.

2170
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Universe 3 looks kind of cool. People will buy it for a while.

2171
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Alright, speaking of DDR, there is another DDR game coming out.

2172
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:48,000
It is Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves, and it's coming for the Wii.

2173
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,000
It's what it sounds like, it's going to be 40 new Disney songs that are going to be coming to the Wii.

2174
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:59,000
You know, the standard press release comes out with this, that apparently you can actually get your Mii in a Disney costume,

2175
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
and that's what you can dance with in the game.

2176
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Apparently there will be some new modes too, like a groove world, where it basically just has achievements and you get costumes based on the achievement.

2177
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Now, what is also cool is the way the community actually tore apart the DDRX disc and found some extra song names on the disc.

2178
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
There's like this master track list that's always in DDR games.

2179
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Ah yes, the master track list, and you would think by now that they would have learned.

2180
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Well, they hacked the master track list and they found a bunch of new songs on it, and guess what, they're all Disney songs.

2181
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
So you can pretty much already tell what songs are going to be in this.

2182
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:47,000
A Pirate's Life, Chim Chim Marie, Disney Carnival, Hakuna Matata, I Just Can't Wait To Be King, Mickey Mouse Club March, The Bare Necessities, Zippity Doodah,

2183
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:59,000
and the most awesome Disney song of all time, The Tiki Room.

2184
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Come on, you could be able to dance to that, right? Can't you see yourself dancing to that?

2185
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Tell me the Tiki Room isn't the most awesome Disney song of all time.

2186
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
The Tiki Room is the best place to go when it's hot.

2187
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:18,000
The question is, why do you see a song called Ducks In The Hood? Don't ask.

2188
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:22,000
I mean, Ducks In The Hood, really?

2189
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Well, those are some of the songs you have to look forward to. By the way, that wasn't the actual Tiki Room recording, that was just something I found.

2190
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
It was actually the Tiki Room Macarena version, but it's very dancey.

2191
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Macarena's cool again, it's retinal occasionally.

2192
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Ice Mickey? Wow, Way To Be Current.

2193
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Alright, where's Macho Duck? What the fuck? I mean, seriously.

2194
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Let's move on with other awesome game news.

2195
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:51,000
I have to actually make a comment about that. It better have freaking dance magic in it.

2196
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I haven't heard. We'll see.

2197
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Rob did have to give me a story that I'm going to completely not give a shit about.

2198
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
What is that?

2199
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:10,000
The fitty game, Blood On The Sand, is going to be published by THQ.

2200
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Activision farted on the idea and said, we don't want this pile of steaming shit.

2201
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,000
So THQ said, wait, we like shit?

2202
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:28,000
To be fair, it doesn't look bad. It's just over the top and with no base in reality whatsoever.

2203
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I mean, if they made Oscars for video games, this would so be nominated next year.

2204
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Well, it's coming out sometime.

2205
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Phew, rest easy. Thank you THQ for giving the gamers.

2206
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Thank you THQ for our fitty.

2207
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:50,000
Well, I don't know, they have like 50 Cent and these games sell.

2208
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Exactly, it'll sell.

2209
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
You'd be surprised.

2210
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
You'd be surprised, I know, I know.

2211
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:01,000
A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2212
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Well, the new Xbox Experience brand new update that's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.

2213
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Everybody's been wondering, when the hell is this thing coming out?

2214
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Well, hopefully we have your answer now.

2215
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:22,000
It was announced during Tokyo Game Show that it will be available to download on November 19th.

2216
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
So that's when you get your brand new Xbox Experience.

2217
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:33,000
The download will take up 128 megabytes of hard drive space or storage space.

2218
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
People have been concerned and kind of in an uproar about,

2219
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Well, you know, why is it going to require space?

2220
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
There are some 360s that are sold without storage.

2221
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Well, I correct you.

2222
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
There are no Xbox 360s currently being sold without storage of any kind.

2223
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:54,000
If you remember, the arcade systems do come with a 256 megabyte memory unit.

2224
02:14:54,000 --> 02:15:02,000
So you can still enjoy the next Xbox Experience, I guess.

2225
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
And if you don't have a fucking memory card or hard drive, I mean, seriously, what the hell's wrong with you?

2226
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Just buy a hard drive.

2227
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Then you probably don't care about the new Xbox Experience either.

2228
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Honestly.

2229
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Although I do still think it was a mistake for Microsoft to just not put the hard drive with all the systems.

2230
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
They wanted to drive the price down, whatever.

2231
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Whatever, I mean, it's fine.

2232
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
The other thing that's rumored to be coming out on the 19th as well,

2233
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Well, apparently Home may be coming out that day as well to kind of counteract the whole new Xbox Experience.

2234
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:37,000
And it makes perfect sense to me, because even if it's not done, they're going to release it anyways.

2235
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Because it's still in beta.

2236
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Yeah, beta. Awesome.

2237
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:47,000
So yeah, expect that probably around the same time as well.

2238
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Alright. Are you looking forward to the new Xbox Experience? I think it looks pretty cool.

2239
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Yeah, don't really care.

2240
02:15:53,000 --> 02:16:01,000
There is one thing I'm looking forward to about it, is that they are going to add new 16x10 screen formats.

2241
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:12,000
So, for example, if I'm playing on my monitor that's 1400x900, I can actually use the full screen now.

2242
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Because before it was kind of stretched a little bit, but now it'll actually be the no native resolution for widescreen monitors.

2243
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Cool.

2244
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Alright, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype line.

2245
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And this is a pretty interesting story.

2246
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
There is actually a study that has gone on out there.

2247
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:36,000
It's a bisexual psychoth- actually, it's not so much a study more than it is just kind of a comment.

2248
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
It's bisexual psychotherapist Paula Hall, and she said this to the BBC.

2249
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Apparently, according to this Paula Hall, she was actually doing this whole study on premature ejaculation was actually what the study was all about.

2250
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Yes, that's what I said, premature ejaculation.

2251
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
And you might be thinking, what the hell does this have to do with video games?

2252
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:59,000
Well, it's because of an interesting comment she actually said as a part of this.

2253
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological.

2254
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:09,000
These men with non-psychological premature ejaculation have very quick reflexes.

2255
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:14,000
They may be excellent at playing tennis or computer games.

2256
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:23,000
So apparently, according to this chick, there's some type of correlation between being a good gamer and finishing quickly in the bedroom.

2257
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Maybe it's because they're just waiting to get back to the game.

2258
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
That doesn't make any sense.

2259
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I don't blame Paula Hall.

2260
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I don't know. That still doesn't make any sense.

2261
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Apparently, what they're trying to do with this whole thing, they're trying to actually make drugs to reduce the likelihood of premature ejaculation, like Viagra in reverse, I guess, a little bit.

2262
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Very interesting.

2263
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I wonder if this is a problem for women.

2264
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Premature ejaculation.

2265
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
You know what?

2266
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
What?

2267
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
The problem for women is men.

2268
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Men are impatient.

2269
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Okay, I'm done. Back to the game. Thanks, lady.

2270
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
You know what else is the problem too?

2271
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
What?

2272
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Women keep nagging them when they're trying to play their games.

2273
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Honey, come to bed.

2274
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,000
That's why God made toys.

2275
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
All right.

2276
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Moving forward.

2277
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Yes, please. We're going to go to the Skype line.

2278
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:21,000
We're going to go to our phones.

2279
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2280
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
And hey, we've got a call on the line.

2281
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Hello, caller, are you there?

2282
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Yep.

2283
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Hey, who is this?

2284
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Hello, Rice Princess.

2285
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Hello, Rice Princess. How are you?

2286
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Oh, I'm okay. How are you?

2287
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I'm good. We're hearing from a lot of local OLR folks tonight,

2288
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:49,000
because I don't know if you heard, but Ecstifer was on the show earlier talking about BlizzCon.

2289
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Oh, boo, BlizzCon.

2290
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Well, what did you call in to tell us about tonight?

2291
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
I went to a CoolerCon.

2292
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Well, you went to a CoolerCon this week. Did you go to Tokyo Game Show?

2293
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
No. Why would I go to that crap?

2294
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:06,000
You went to a con that was cooler than Tokyo Game Show and BlizzCon combined?

2295
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Where did you go?

2296
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Yeah, I went to QQCon.

2297
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Awesome. QQCon. I went to QQCon, too. I think I saw you there.

2298
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
I mean, there was a lot of people there, but I think I saw you in the crowd.

2299
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Yeah, I think I ran across you once or twice.

2300
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I think so. Tell the listeners something about QQCon, because I bet nobody's ever heard of QQCon.

2301
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
But did you have something to do with the starting of QQCon?

2302
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:38,000
No, it was actually organized by two of our friends, Mel and Eric.

2303
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:43,000
But we just actually held it at our venue, aka our apartment.

2304
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And yeah, it's just awesome and free.

2305
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Free? That's awesome. Tell the listeners a little something about the idea behind QQCon.

2306
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Why was there a QQCon? What were we celebrating at QQCon?

2307
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Oh, okay. Well, you know how there was BlizzCon this weekend?

2308
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:10,000
And a lot of us didn't get to go because they had this ridiculous lottery system to have to get tickets and stupid crap like that.

2309
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
We just kind of had our own convention.

2310
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:18,000
And it's the QQCon because, as we all know, QQ means crying in the game.

2311
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Because the QQs look like crying eyes.

2312
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:27,000
So we were all just basically convening to cry about not going to BlizzCon.

2313
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Was there any cosplay at the tournament, or at the convention, as SSG100Matt?

2314
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:39,000
There was no cosplay, but we all got swag in the form of Frostmourne.

2315
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:45,000
And we all welded them and played around with them and stuff.

2316
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Does that count?

2317
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Will there be a QQCon next year?

2318
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Absolutely. There would be one every year from here on out.

2319
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:02,000
I think what would be awesome is that even if the organizers were able to get into BlizzCon next year, there should still be a QQCon.

2320
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Because what is a convention without bitching about something that happened at the convention?

2321
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Of course. We would just have it in the hotel or something.

2322
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Exactly. So everybody's invited to the second annual QQCon next year.

2323
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:24,000
We might have to find a larger venue according to how many people actually find up for next year's QQCon.

2324
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Well this is how these things start.

2325
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Yeah, we'll have to see about that.

2326
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Alright, sounds good.

2327
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Hey, any other video games you've been playing this week you want to tell our listeners about?

2328
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Um, no.

2329
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Well alright then.

2330
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:42,000
I didn't play anything except for WarioWare at QQCon because it's the best con ever.

2331
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
But that's pretty much it.

2332
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2333
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Um, yeah, you have to poop at QQCon.

2334
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
I had YYCon.

2335
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
You did?

2336
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
What's YYCon?

2337
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Why? Why? It means yay.

2338
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Yes, I did have to poop at QQCon.

2339
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It's going to be an event next year. Alright, I'm hanging up. This joke's gone on way too long.

2340
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Bye Rice Princess!

2341
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Bye.

2342
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:15,000
Bye. Did she just poop in the phone? I think she did.

2343
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I don't think that was a poop. I think it was a fart.

2344
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
1877 Game OLR.

2345
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2346
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Hi, this is Spaz.

2347
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Hey, what's up Spaz?

2348
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Uh, not much. Um, I just want to comment on something that you were saying earlier in the show.

2349
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
Yes.

2350
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:38,000
If I remember right, you were mentioning that you're considering playing PlayStation 3.

2351
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
The what? I'm sorry?

2352
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:46,000
If I remember right, you had mentioned that you're considering getting a PlayStation 3?

2353
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Yeah, I think it's past the point of consideration. I think it's going to happen. It's just a question of when.

2354
02:22:52,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Well, you know, I think that if you do get it, you'll really enjoy it. The only thing to bear in mind is that it would be a good idea to compare it to the 360 in any way.

2355
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Because it's kind of, in its own way, its own beast. If you try to compare it to the 360, you'll probably come off disappointed.

2356
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:28,000
What kinds of cool things am I going to find on the PlayStation 3 that I'm not going to get on the Xbox 360, in your opinion?

2357
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Well, there's, as you probably know, there's not a whole lot of system exclusives in terms of games.

2358
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:50,000
But what few there are, I think you may like stuff like Solcom, Warhawk, some of the downloadable original PlayStation 1 games.

2359
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:59,000
They do have some interactive art there. In fact, I was just talking about one with Bobby Blackwell on his show.

2360
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:07,000
And the most recent one is kind of weird, but it's still interesting nonetheless.

2361
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:18,000
And then, of course, there's the whole Pixeljunk series of games, including Pixeljunk Monsters, which is kind of like a tower defense game, which is pretty fun.

2362
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I could go on and on in terms of games, but I don't want to take up too much time on the show.

2363
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:44,000
And plus, there's one benefit to the PlayStation 3's video store that the 360 doesn't do all well, in the sense that with the 360, you can only rent the movies,

2364
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:50,000
whereas the PlayStation 3 gives you the choice between renting or outright buying.

2365
02:24:50,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Some people are kind of against renting, they would really buy, because once you see the movie, you're basically out a couple bucks,

2366
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:14,000
whereas if you're outright buying the movie, you can't watch it as many times as you want whenever you want.

2367
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Well, but doesn't the PlayStation 3 kind of do both? Don't they have Blu-ray and a download service now?

2368
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Yeah, that's absolutely right. Basically, you have a choice. Blu-ray is a little bit more expensive, but at the same time, you get all the extras.

2369
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:45,000
It's in high-def, and since it's on the desk, it won't take up any space on your hard drive.

2370
02:25:45,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Whereas if you buy from the download service, you won't get the extras, and if you buy the movies, they'll be in standard definition, but you'll get a cheaper price point.

2371
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Fair enough, but Blu-rays are kind of expensive. I mean, you have to really like a movie in order to want to get it on Blu-ray.

2372
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
You know what I mean? They're like 24 bucks a pop. That's a lot more than a rental.

2373
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Well, actually, it may be 24 bucks in and around the area, but at least in my area, which is western New York,

2374
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:29,000
they're closer to, on the cheap end, like 30 bucks, and as high as 35.

2375
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Hey, speaking of high-def movies, I was just in the house because I had to run and make a potty break while another story was going on.

2376
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:39,000
They're actually using the HD DVD player right now. They're watching Stardust, which I love that movie.

2377
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:46,000
Anyway, sorry, just kind of a random tangent, but hey, that movie was actually pretty cheap because HD DVD had already bit the dust at that point when I got that.

2378
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Question from Frisbee in chat, and this will be the last one, and then we're going to get to one more call before we end the show tonight.

2379
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Frisbee wants to know, is Blu-ray really that good?

2380
02:26:55,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Well, in my opinion, yes. To give an analogy in terms of games, it's kind of like trying to play Halo 3 as opposed to the original NES version of Washington Attack.

2381
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And that's in terms of graphics, not in terms of fun or anything like that.

2382
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Halo 3 is at least a balance better than Washington Attack in terms of graphics.

2383
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I think a big part of it, too, is that it's kind of like watching HDTV for the first time compared to regular TV.

2384
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I mean, true DVDs are a little slightly better than regular TV, like the old TVs, because they can do interlaced, but it's a big step.

2385
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Well, anyway, Spaz, we've got to wrap up, but do you have any quick last thoughts for our listeners?

2386
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Oh, yeah. Obviously, I can't do it now, but probably during the week if you like, I can send you an email with a list of recommended games and whatnot that gives me joy.

2387
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:18,000
I'll always take a look, Spaz. You can email that to me anytime.

2388
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Sure. Have a good one.

2389
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
All right, you have a good one. Take care, buddy.

2390
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
All right, you too. Bye-bye.

2391
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Bye-bye. We'll do one more call here on the Skyline 1877 Game OLR.

2392
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2393
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. It is he who is very uncreative and can't think of a way of describing himself tonight.

2394
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:38,000
How about you just call yourself Jason?

2395
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Yeah, that works, too. Hey, guys, it's Jason.

2396
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Hey, how you doing?

2397
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Hey, it's so funny. You can totally tell the difference between the telephone calls and the Skype calls. The Skype calls really are pretty clear.

2398
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
The Internet takes off for phones pretty soon.

2399
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
That's all right. Hey, what's on your mind, Jason?

2400
02:28:52,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I don't remember all of the details specifically. I was driving into work and my iPhone tuner app was cutting out, so I didn't get all of the conversation.

2401
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Oh, my God. I keep forgetting that people can actually listen to this show in the car now because of Edge. That is nuts.

2402
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:15,000
We plug it straight into the car stereo and when 3G decides to actually work properly, I can just be listening to whatever I want, in this case, the show.

2403
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:23,000
That is amazing. Technology has come so far. You're going to have to tell me how you do that. I don't know if you're looking at Justin.TV. I just finally picked up the iPhone this week.

2404
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:30,000
All I have is Twitterrific and I got Tap Tap Revolution or whatever it's called, Tap Tap Mania.

2405
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
It's a terrible game.

2406
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Yeah, it's a little stupid.

2407
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I hated that game.

2408
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:44,000
The frame rate, well, it's free. I can't complain about free. But what's weird is that it's what they advertise in the Apple store on the big banners, which I thought was interesting.

2409
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:48,000
I'll complain about free. Yars sucked and so does Tap Tap Revenge.

2410
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:57,000
All right, sorry. Brad is sending me a private message for the tuner app. I'm going to definitely have to check that out. Wow. Man, it blows my mind how far technology has come.

2411
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I don't like tuner.

2412
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Is there other ones that are good?

2413
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I've actually just been using AOL radio to listen to the comedy channel.

2414
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
But you can't hear us on there.

2415
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,000
But tuner for a while stopped picking us up. Actually, they limited all the stations.

2416
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
And so correct me if I'm wrong, this is all free. It's not going to cost me extra money on the AT&T daily.

2417
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Tuner costs. AOL radio is free.

2418
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,000
But I mean, the bit rate, the data, the bandwidth is free.

2419
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
They shouldn't.

2420
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Oh my god, that's amazing.

2421
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:28,000
The iPhones only sell unlimited data plans, right?

2422
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Yeah, they do. It just blows my mind though.

2423
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
And it can be used for the application or the service.

2424
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:33,000
It just blows my mind.

2425
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
It's just your phone streaming the station.

2426
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Wow. Anyhow, sorry. I'm going to have to try that later.

2427
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:42,000
It just blows my mind that somebody could be actually listening to us in the car right now.

2428
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Seven years ago, when we only had twelve listeners, I never thought that possible.

2429
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:53,000
But we really are starting to reach that day and age where you will be able to listen to us like an over the air wave show.

2430
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:57,000
We're there. It's just not many people are doing it. It's crazy.

2431
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:02,000
If Sprint actually kicks into high gear and really gets WiMAX everywhere, then it's going to be a really good day.

2432
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Because then PSPs and all of the other non-cellular network but wireless capable devices are going to be able to do the same thing just about anywhere.

2433
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Anyway, I'm sorry. You probably didn't call in to talk about Tuner.

2434
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Oh, I don't care. I love technology. Are you kidding me? If you guys were a tech show, I'd be on here all the time.

2435
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:22,000
Let me guess. You probably had something to say about the beat and groovy or beat meaning.

2436
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Because we've been talking a lot about music games tonight.

2437
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Beat and groovy is a joke.

2438
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:29,000
I was going to say two things. That was going to be the shorter of two things.

2439
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,000
I reiterate what I said before, but I make it worse.

2440
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Konami needs to stop releasing in America.

2441
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:40,000
They're not going to hold a candle to what every other company has now done.

2442
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:49,000
And while I think Scratch looks really terrible, it's probably going to perform better, look better, and work better than BeatMania US, quite unfortunately.

2443
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:52,000
And it's probably going to do better because of the music choice.

2444
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
They never should have closed Hawaii.

2445
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
And they never should have moved Konami SoCal.

2446
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Nope.

2447
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Or NorCal, whichever.

2448
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:06,000
And a lot of us gave Konami Hawaii a lot of shit when that first DDR game came out on Xbox, but boy did the second one shut us all up.

2449
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,000
It seemed like they, more than any other division, were really listening to people.

2450
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,000
I thought we gave them shit because they released DDRPC.

2451
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:19,000
But without DDRPC, we would have never had Mr. Spanky. So, case in point.

2452
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Anyhow, sorry. What else besides beat and groovy? Beat and yucky.

2453
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Both of you and Loki were pretty wrong on StarCraft II.

2454
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:37,000
The way that they're veiling this, if I'm understanding correctly, I'm seeing two sides to the story, but neither of your opinions matched it.

2455
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
So here's my take.

2456
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:50,000
The release date is, I don't know if this has actually been mentioned, but the release date for the three StarCraft IIs is probably going to be on the same day or very, very close together, isn't it?

2457
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
I haven't the clue. I didn't follow BlizzCon that closely, but okay.

2458
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:00,000
I don't think it's been announced. It's just the fact that it's going to be a trilogy and that's what everybody's going over.

2459
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:10,000
The same thing that Bobby was saying, and I'll do it in the same way as him, you're going to buy one game three times, you're going to buy one game three times, and you will buy one game three times.

2460
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:17,000
He's absolutely correct. They are going to take one game, give the same features on all three to play with other people.

2461
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:20,000
That's a good feature. I'm glad they're doing that.

2462
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:25,000
But the campaigns that they're splitting that up like that is pretty annoying.

2463
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:32,000
I'm hoping they... PC games, mainstream PC games come out at like $40 or $50, don't they?

2464
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Yeah, that's about right.

2465
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
I don't play PC games anymore.

2466
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Spore was $49, right?

2467
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Yeah.

2468
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:45,000
$49.99 for Spore. The price tags... I still have the box here and the price tag still on there, so I would expect that's the price you're going to...

2469
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:49,000
You can't see that on Justin. I would expect that's the price you're going to pay for StarCraft.

2470
02:33:49,000 --> 02:34:02,000
I'm hoping and assuming that they're going to make it a little bit cheaper, because $150 just to play a game that presumably you'll want to complete, paying $150 is going to be excessive.

2471
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:08,000
And I'm really hoping that each game is going to be... $25 and $30 even makes it a little bit better.

2472
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Cheaper than that would be great, but I'm seriously hoping that all three do not come out at $50 apiece.

2473
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:21,000
But if one does multiplayer... I mean, there's a bunch of people that only play StarCraft for multiplayer. I mean, the hell with single player.

2474
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:29,000
As a matter of fact, this is the funny thing. A couple of months ago, I finally got StarCraft to work on OSX. I have a MacBook Pro, by the way.

2475
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Yay!

2476
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Anyways, I finally got StarCraft to work on my Mac, and I've been playing through it. I've been playing the campaign and nothing else.

2477
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:45,000
The real rub is I'm playing without cheats, because I've never done that. But I'm playing through the campaigns and nothing else.

2478
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Especially now that StarCraft II is coming out, I want to keep doing that.

2479
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:58,000
And all three of the races, I don't prefer the Terrans, but that doesn't mean I don't want to play their campaign.

2480
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:04,000
The story in the first one was magnificent, and I want to play that the whole way through.

2481
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Probably multiple times based off what I'm hearing they're doing.

2482
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:13,000
I'm very curious to see, because Blizzard's pretty in tune with their fanbase. I'm very curious to see how they kind of respond to the negativity.

2483
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:16,000
Because you know they will this week. We'll have a follow-up on this.

2484
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:21,000
I'm really hoping that they do it for cheaper, because it would make sense, and they're very good at that.

2485
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Alright. Well, Jason, we've got to wrap up and get the show on out of here, but do you have any last thoughts?

2486
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Your Netflix achievement was hilarious, and I want to see it happen.

2487
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Thank you. And if you have no idea what we're talking about, you'll have to listen to Bobby's show. So there's a plug for Bobby.

2488
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:40,000
There's a plug for Bobby. Do it. Call GameStop on iTunes. Podcast.

2489
02:35:40,000 --> 02:36:06,000
And while you're there, leave us a nice review too. By the way, I've got to say, speaking of the iTunes reviews, and if you don't already know, you can leave reviews on iTunes, and it really helps in the ranking of the show, and it gets it a little higher in the list the more people find us. It helps spread the word.

2490
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:15,000
The only name I've seen around is Let's Have Tea. It would fit. And they say, I've been listening to orange on the radio for a few years now, and still today, I've yet to find a podcast that's nearly the same feel as OLR does.

2491
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:23,000
After a few episodes, you'll begin to feel like these people are your friends, rather than your entertainers. Half of that is because the show is made up of three people who are good friends outside the show.

2492
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Aww. Doesn't that give you warm fuzzies all over? Make you a little nauseous? Aww. So anyway, sorry. We love the positive reviews.

2493
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Absolutely. All right. Jason, we've got to let you go to wrap up, okay? Bye-bye. I don't think you can hear me.

2494
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Guys. Oh, see you. Bye. That was kind of an awkward end. All right. Yeah. The Rob D says, gives you warm fuzzies until someone's outside your door asking to hang out.

2495
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Well, that's why we always say that, hey, we're based out of Sacramento, but that's about all we tell you. It's a big place. Over a million people.

2496
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:05,000
All right. Anyhow, hey, we've got to wrap up the show. It's that time. Before we wrap up, though, some quick last minute stories.

2497
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
I actually want to start tonight. Tiger Claw sent me this link, and I thought it was pretty funny.

2498
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Microsoft is suing DHL. You know who DHL is? They're kind of like FedEx, UPS, but they're like number three, I think.

2499
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Where they hire convicts.

2500
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Well, here's the thing. Well, apparently it's come to a head there, because DHL lost 21,600 Xbox consoles.

2501
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Damn.

2502
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Well, here's the thing. A train derailed in Texas. So because of the train derailment.

2503
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
It derailed right into my garage.

2504
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:37,000
This is everything. Again, this is coming from a lawsuit. It's been filed in Seattle, of course. That's where Microsoft's based.

2505
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Two million dollars in damages from DHL is what they want. It's because of two containers of Xbox consoles that had impact damage, wedding, pilfering, and storage.

2506
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:49,000
And the train derailed around Duke, Texas. So suddenly there's tons of Xbox users in Texas.

2507
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
If only it were Duke Nukem, Texas.

2508
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:58,000
By the way, this happened on October 13, 2007. So it was quite some time ago, but the legal stuff is slow right now.

2509
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
So there you have it.

2510
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,000
By the way, usually you would just go, well, it's an accident. Why are they being so mean?

2511
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:12,000
Nope. They are saying in the lawsuit that a DHL has not compensated it for the loss and that the delivery service, again, according to the lawsuit, quote,

2512
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:24,000
negligently breached its duties as a common carrier, handler, bailey, warehouseman, agent, or in its other capabilities.

2513
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:28,000
So they're basically saying, you done fucked up and ruined all our Xboxes because of it.

2514
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:31,000
And so that's why they were so short on Xboxes a year ago.

2515
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
There you have it.

2516
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Anyhow, the Rob D. speaks up in chat and says, someone wet on two containers of 360 controllers, keep those 360s out of the bathroom.

2517
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:50,000
I knew that was a bad idea. I think when they fell out of the train, they got in the rain in Spain on the plane.

2518
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

2519
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Yes, I do, actually. Sure, what's up?

2520
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Alright, a bunch of interesting stuff.

2521
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:07,000
First off, XNA games are showing up on Xbox Live, apparently now. I have yet to go actually check this out, but apparently they started launching them.

2522
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:14,000
I think that's what the last update was, remember? They had a live down for a day or so and they were tweaking some shit.

2523
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Alright.

2524
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:23,000
But anyways, apparently there are some errors popping up right now, but it says there's two titles seem to be unplayable to average users.

2525
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:29,000
With XNA Creators Club launcher errors popping up even if you have the program installed.

2526
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I don't know, so maybe it's something coming, but apparently they had both a free demo and the full versions priced at 100 Microsoft points.

2527
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:41,000
100 Microsoft points ain't a lot.

2528
02:39:41,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Shown at Tokyo Game Show, Noby Noby Boy, which has the most weird video I've ever seen. It's basically, I don't even know how to describe the gameplay, but it has a really crazy song that fits in with Katamari Damacy.

2529
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Definitely check out the video, it's weird. I don't even know what this is. It's gotta be a Playstation Network title because it looks too simple for an actual full release game.

2530
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Left 4 Dead, the demo has been confirmed to be coming out early November, so that'll be fun to check out on Xbox 360 and PC.

2531
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Also, another demo that's been kind of confirmed, Mirror's Edge, apparently coming November 6th. This has actually been revealed via GameStop's website because on their little bonus offer thing there it says,

2532
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:40,000
on a special note, Mirror's Edge demo will be available for download November 6th. Interesting.

2533
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Lots of Xbox Live Arcade games announced at Tokyo Game Show, lots and lots and lots of stuff.

2534
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:55,000
King of Fighters 98, there's gonna be a brand new Arkanoid game coming to live.

2535
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Oh yeah, and the Space Invaders game, I'm so excited about the Space Invaders game, seriously.

2536
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Space Invaders Extreme. Joining that will be Metal Slug 7, the game that was supposedly only for the DS.

2537
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:19,000
A brand new R-Type game, R-Type Dimensions, which looks pretty awesome, and like I said before, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match will be coming as well.

2538
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:25,000
And no word exactly on when, but man, there's a lot of good stuff in the tubes here.

2539
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Let's talk more about R-Type. R-Type Dimensions is actually going to be recreating R-Type 1 and 2, so that's pretty cool.

2540
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:44,000
Other games coming out, Dodon Pachi, and I guess that came out in Japan only, but I don't even know if that's an Xbox Live Arcade game.

2541
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Oh man, they have some screens for the new R-Type game, looks awesome. Awesome, awesome. And let's see, I know I've got a lot more here, sorry.

2542
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:06,000
There's a new t-shirt that was shown at Tokyo Game Show for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. Pretty cool, I think Jimmy would like that.

2543
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:18,000
What was I going to say here? I gave Rob a video for this. They announced, remember that Rock Band reality show?

2544
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Well apparently, Rock Band To The Stars will be premiering on VH1 Classic this month, and there's a little promo video for it.

2545
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Not really sure what it is, but it says, on October 15th, VH1 Classic will premiere a new reality show called Rock Band To The Stars.

2546
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:48,000
It will feature Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach as they play host to 12 wannabe rockers as they live in a mansion and compete in different Rock Band 2 competitions.

2547
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Here you go, courtesy of EW.com.

2548
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Welcome to Rock Band To The Stars. This is about Rock Band 2.

2549
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:04,000
Two legendary frontman, Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper, will choose their ultimate Rock Band bands from a pool of 15 rabid Rock Band masters.

2550
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Each week, the players will face grueling challenges and painful eliminations to find out who rules in all things Rock Band 2.

2551
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Rock Band To The Stars premieres this Wednesday during jumpstart videos, only on VH1.

2552
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Looks a little silly. Looks very low budget. Very, very low budget. What does TV come to?

2553
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I don't know.

2554
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
I get it. It's a little play on words there.

2555
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Yeah. Another funny thing, you know how they have in-game advertising for different things.

2556
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:46,000
EA has a lot of it. Well, Burnout Paradise apparently has Barack Obama banners now on their billboards.

2557
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Very interesting advertising, by the way.

2558
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:57,000
And apparently there's a rumor that IGN let slip a new Wii channel. I think we may have talked about this briefly last week.

2559
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
You know how there was that Bandbrothers DX channel?

2560
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Well, they're saying that maybe there's a new channel coming out for Guitar Hero to use your DS on the Wii.

2561
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:07,000
So it's kind of similar to that, but with Guitar Hero.

2562
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Huh. That's kind of cool.

2563
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:21,000
And then, let's see here. One thing I thought would be funny to mention, Rob, there's a video advertising Dookapon Kingdom.

2564
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:27,000
And the one thing that they do show advertised on there is they name their character Sassy Pants.

2565
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Awesome! What game was this?

2566
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Dookapon Kingdom.

2567
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:34,000
They took it from me. That's my WoW character name, by the way. Sassy Pants.

2568
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:37,000
And that's it.

2569
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Dark Sakura? Anything on your neck of the woods?

2570
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:41,000
No.

2571
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Alright. Oh, we just got this in. Late-breaking news. This is kind of a follow-up to the whole DHL and Microsoft thing going on.

2572
02:44:49,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Well, DHL has released its defense as to why all the Xboxes got wet.

2573
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Gotta blame it on something, guys.

2574
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Come on, Microsoft.

2575
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Don't put the blame on us, Microsoft.

2576
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:32,000
It's not like we got out the hose.

2577
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Why can't they just own up to it, okay?

2578
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:38,000
No, this is so stupid.

2579
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:53,000
I don't give a shit. Whatever their fucking reason is, while it's in their hands, it's in their care, therefore their responsibility, you fucking own up.

2580
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Whatever.

2581
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:01,000
And you know what Microsoft would say to you, Dark Sakura?

2582
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Girl, you know it's true. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

2583
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so you can put the nail in the coffin of this program.

2584
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2585
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:22,000
My final thought is lots of games to play, and there's a lot more coming.

2586
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

2587
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Meh.

2588
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:28,000
My final thought tonight is peanut butter.

2589
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,000
And that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2590
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:34,000
Hey, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting.

2591

2592
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Because really, word of mouth is how this word of our station travels.

2593
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:47,000
And you know, it's the number one way we get new listeners to our show.

2594
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:53,000
So please, since we do it for free and don't really burden you with commercials or any of that stuff, consider telling some folks about the show.

2595
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:59,000
That's going to do it. We will see you next week for episode number 299 of Orange Launch Radio, if you can believe it.

2596
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:00,000
Sweet shit.

2597
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:05,000
All right. I know. We'll be back. See you then.

2598
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:08,000
You've been listening to Orange Launch Radio.
