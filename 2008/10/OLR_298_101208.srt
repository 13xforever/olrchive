[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, October 12, 2008, rumors about Blu-ray on 360 surface again, a next-gen Castlevania gets teased, and will YouTube soon sell you games?

2
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:35,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,144
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:44,031
[SPEAKER_09]: For the next few hours we're going to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:49,498
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you for the next few hours as will the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:52,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I will be not joining everybody for the next few hours.

7
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you going, young lady?

8
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Out of body.

9
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:55,622
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

10
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:58,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, have fun and let us know how it goes.

11
00:00:58,484 --> 00:00:59,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure thing, Rob.

12
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:00,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are you going to be visiting?

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to go to Disneyland and back?

14
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:01,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

15
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:02,227
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

16
00:01:02,267 --> 00:01:02,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Have fun.

17
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:04,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Ride Space Mountain for me.

18
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Woo-hoo.

19
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:04,909
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who's giggling like a schoolgirl over here.

21
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:10,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not giggling like a schoolgirl.

22
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:10,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you are.

23
00:01:10,934 --> 00:01:12,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I was doing the opening and I hear, woo-hoo.

24
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:13,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't Shoot the Puppy

25
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:30,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, is your mic on?

26
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,698
[SPEAKER_09]: You're very, very quiet tonight for some reason.

27
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:32,859
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no on-off button.

28
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:33,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.

29
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you just weren't talking into it, right?

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sorry, go ahead.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So, don't shoot the puppy?

32
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't shoot the puppy.

33
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:52,489
[SPEAKER_07]: The puppy hops across the screen very happily, but it gets slower every level, and you just keep getting, you know, it's a test of patience, and if you get frustrated and you push a button, it shoots the puppy with, like, this giant artillery cannon.

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,691
[SPEAKER_09]: This sounds terrible.

35
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:57,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, this is a Flash game or something?

36
00:01:57,212 --> 00:01:57,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is.

37
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:01,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the whole game.

38
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,130
[SPEAKER_09]: You just sit there.

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:02,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I see this?

40
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is horrible radio, but can I... What the hell?

41
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:07,693
[SPEAKER_09]: What happened?

42
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:08,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you shoot the puppy?

43
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:08,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

44
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:11,195
[SPEAKER_07]: I clicked the button and it's... You'll just have to show me later.

45
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,335
[SPEAKER_07]: This is horrible radio.

46
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:17,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, PETA has just joined our chat room and is currently protesting the show.

47
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:18,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,759
[SPEAKER_11]: PETA's full of shit.

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's a cute little stick figure puppy.

50
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:25,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so start... Does it bark and stuff?

51
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:28,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, I don't have the sound on.

52
00:02:28,693 --> 00:02:37,119
[SPEAKER_09]: This is coming from a website, rrrr, that's five r's, dot com, even though there's only four.

53
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so shoot it.

54
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:42,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's terrible.

55
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,625
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's only a cartoon, it's not like the real thing.

56
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:52,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So wait, again, the website, rrrr, that's five r's, even though it's really only four.

57
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Love that sense of humor.

58
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,011
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something else.

59
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:57,311
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

60
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, hey, you guys are joining us in chat.

61
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:04,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com here live on this Sunday evening.

62
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:06,212
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Dysentery?

63
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:07,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, DJ Dysentery.

64
00:03:07,393 --> 00:03:09,173
[SPEAKER_09]: I think DJ Dysentery has listened to the show before.

65
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,154
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, but that just makes me think of poo.

66
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:14,954
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Dysentery is in chat and says, I don't think there's sound.

67
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:17,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all right.

68
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:19,619
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what have you played this week?

69
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I have disproven the old theory What theory is that?

70
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:22,962
[SPEAKER_09]: That Airman can be defeated after all Because I played Mega Man 2

71
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:44,810
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68, you're great people for the unethical shit-talking of humans.

72
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:08,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Puesto?

73
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of that.

74
00:04:09,893 --> 00:04:10,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Puesto.

75
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,654
[SPEAKER_11]: No, PETA is People Eating Tasty Animals.

76
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:14,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, come on, enough PETA talk.

77
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:15,336
[SPEAKER_11]: PETA's full of shit anyway.

78
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:29,081
[SPEAKER_11]: But I played some Mega Man 2, and we actually were playing through Mega Man 9, Dan and his buddy Jeff were, and there's some really annoying levels in that game.

79
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it kind of weird to go back and-

80
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:33,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Man 2 had more drops.

81
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I'm correct, the difficult mode was the default mode for the Japanese version.

82
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:37,012
[SPEAKER_09]: It sure was.

83
00:04:50,072 --> 00:05:00,815
[SPEAKER_11]: and another thing is that we were talking about the Mega Man 2 Anniversary Edition that came out on PlayStation and how it was a lot harder.

84
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was based off the Japanese one, if I remember right.

85
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:04,696
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was harder than that.

86
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:08,237
[SPEAKER_11]: It was harder than that because we went through and played on difficult mode.

87
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:09,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's so wrong.

88
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,217
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

89
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:11,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

90
00:05:12,538 --> 00:05:13,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't shoot the puppy.

91
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to go back to that again.

92
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:16,319
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

93
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:18,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

94
00:05:34,878 --> 00:06:01,831
[SPEAKER_11]: well um at any rate um we also did the try to proto man mode and it's freaking kind of tough too because he takes double damage but he has the shield and it's it would be really hard to make it through through uh that the wiliest stages with proto man um also um i've played ragnarok ragnar crack crack rock all right but um

95
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,260
[SPEAKER_11]: and I did homework.

96
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:04,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Homework game.

97
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:05,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Manorific.

98
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I also watched the debate game too.

99
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:08,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

100
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:09,484
[SPEAKER_11]: And voted!

101
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:11,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I voted this week!

102
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:11,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

103
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,426
[SPEAKER_09]: As everybody should.

104
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:16,388
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter who you support, you should go out and vote.

105
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:18,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Because voting is important.

106
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:20,110
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't vote, you don't get to complain about the result.

107
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:21,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

108
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:23,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's move on.

109
00:06:24,313 --> 00:06:25,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

110
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:27,215
[SPEAKER_07]: It was alright.

111
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:28,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Only really played a couple things.

112
00:06:29,936 --> 00:06:31,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto 4, as usual.

113
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:36,299
[SPEAKER_07]: and I also played more Saints Row 2 because that game is awesome.

114
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:44,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm finished the Brotherhood storyline and I'm starting the Sons of Samiti and that's kind of interesting.

115
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:52,218
[SPEAKER_07]: And I tried to play some online deathmatch today but it was hard to join the game so...

116
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Ended up quitting on that.

117
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:03,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played a bit of Fable 2 and got past the child stage in it and started kind of your adult life.

118
00:07:04,454 --> 00:07:06,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And really got distracted with dancing in front of people.

119
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:08,456
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I got an achievement for it.

120
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:09,257
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where I quit.

121
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:11,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

122
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:13,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

123
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:18,593
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been getting a sneak peek at a lot of early holiday games, because Fable 2 is not out for a couple weeks, right?

124
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,413
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

125
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And Saints Row 2 is out, what, this week?

126
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Tuesday.

127
00:07:22,394 --> 00:07:22,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally.

128
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,995
[SPEAKER_09]: At least you'll finally have some people to play multiplayer with.

129
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:25,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

130
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:28,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be cool, and keep finding new things to do in that game.

131
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:29,496
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

132
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:33,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you didn't really spend a whole lot of time with Fable 2, so you can't tell us a whole lot more about it.

133
00:07:34,357 --> 00:07:35,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how does it compare to the first one?

134
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:38,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I never played the first one, so that I really can't tell you.

135
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:39,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

136
00:07:39,118 --> 00:07:39,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.

137
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,141
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, let's see, moving on.

138
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:43,042
[SPEAKER_09]: My gaming week.

139
00:07:44,262 --> 00:07:46,644
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've been playing a variety of stuff, pretty much the old stuff.

140
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:49,246
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the old standbys, Warcraft and so on.

141
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:51,727
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did check out a couple new games.

142
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat and Groovy on Xbox Live Arcade.

143
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,611
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're longtime music game fans.

144
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:03,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, the roots of our station, the name of the station comes from old school music games.

145
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:08,658
[SPEAKER_09]: And you actually see it show up in this game, Beat and Groovy, because one of the songs is by a group called Orange Lounge.

146
00:08:08,678 --> 00:08:09,379
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's kind of where...

147
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:10,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

148
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,781
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

149
00:09:01,349 --> 00:09:02,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

150
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,436
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:37,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I've seen it.

152
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:41,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the import versions of Poppy Music, which are some really fun music games.

153
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:53,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a shame that now people who don't get music games, or people that think that Guitar Hero was the first music game ever made, or maybe even like Frequency or Amplitude, are going to think that this whole franchise is just total crap based off of this.

154
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, A, you can't remap the controls.

155
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,515
[SPEAKER_09]: When you play online, you can only play online in three-button mode.

156
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:02,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

157
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

158
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:41,171
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't think we should have to support it simply because it's pop and music and simply because it's the game we want to see.

159
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:46,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sorry, I reject those calls that say we should buy this because then we might get this.

160
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:47,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, no.

161
00:10:48,257 --> 00:10:50,079
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't live in that day and age anymore.

162
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:58,346
[SPEAKER_09]: If Konami hasn't learned the lesson by now that Americans are willing to latch on to good music games, then they're just not going to get it.

163
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:06,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see no need to buy this game to somehow justify them to fix it and put out the game they should have in the first place.

164
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:12,421
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said, I did buy the game, but I felt some type of editorial obligation to because I don't get them for free.

165
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:14,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to give you a fair impression here on the show.

166
00:11:15,062 --> 00:11:17,263
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, this game is just so borked.

167
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,343
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, the leaderboards...

168
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,591
[SPEAKER_09]: You would think the leaderboard scores would be like endless mode or who got the highest score on this song.

169
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:30,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, it's one leaderboard and it's for online mode and it's not even wins versus losses.

170
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,053
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cumulative score.

171
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:39,055
[SPEAKER_09]: So in other words, the person who's ranked number one on the Beat and Groovy leaderboard is just the person who's played the most matches online and gotten the highest score because of it.

172
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:39,975
[SPEAKER_09]: That's dumb.

173
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:40,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It's dumb.

174
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,576
[SPEAKER_09]: This game is borked in so many ways and it's really, really sad.

175
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:49,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I looked at video and it made my heart break a little bit

176
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,340
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

177
00:11:52,781 --> 00:12:01,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So honestly, I mean, again, it's sad because I think there could have been a good game here, but for right now, if you want to play a decent music game on Xbox Live Arcade, just go get Boom Boom Rocket.

178
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:02,952
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same concept.

179
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,794
[SPEAKER_09]: You mash buttons to things when they hit a line.

180
00:12:05,094 --> 00:12:06,175
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot better looking.

181
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:12,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I could say the music's better in Boom Boom Rocket, but actually that would be the one thing that Poppin' Music has on...

182
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:18,735
[SPEAKER_09]: The other game, Boom Boom Rocket, is that the song list is slightly better, even if it is nine songs.

183
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:28,881
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some pretty good songs in it, like Moon and Star Mine and the Earth whatever song that sounds like the... Yeah, that song's pretty cool, too.

184
00:12:28,901 --> 00:12:29,521
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

185
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Rob.

186
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:30,522
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

187
00:12:30,622 --> 00:12:32,643
[SPEAKER_11]: We should go to my house and play poppin' music.

188
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:33,484
[SPEAKER_09]: We should.

189
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, honestly... I'd rather play Session Wind.

190
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to play a great music game that's like Beat and Groovy, go import poppin' music.

191
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:40,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

192
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:40,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

193
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, really, really want an arcade-style controller.

194
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:45,341
[SPEAKER_09]: They are fun.

195
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a friend that had one.

196
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,242
[SPEAKER_09]: They're fun.

197
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:50,082
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of weird that they would release this game with no controller here.

198
00:12:50,142 --> 00:12:50,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

199
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:56,584
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes no sense because, I mean, have you ever tried to play poppin' music on the PlayStation controller?

200
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:57,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

201
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,104
[SPEAKER_11]: It's freaking hard.

202
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Although it is kind of fun to try it on a 2DX controller.

203
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:06,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Now our buddy Bobby Blackwolf actually did this pretty awesome YouTube that compares Beat & Groovy to Poppin' Music 13.

204
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:08,707
[SPEAKER_09]: The note charts are the exact same.

205
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:10,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is fine.

206
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:12,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that.

207
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:22,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't hold that against them, except for the fact that sometimes you have the purple and the blue notes come up back to back, and when you have to use the control pad for both of those, it makes it hard.

208
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,807
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't hit two on the control pad at the same time.

209
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:28,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can kind of do upper left, but it's mixed results at best.

210
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And what if you have the purple and the orange?

211
00:13:32,653 --> 00:13:34,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess you can hit one with the white, but still, it just...

212
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

213
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:11,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to mention with Saints Row 2, all the cheat codes leaked online, including those wonderful exclusive codes that GameStop had if you pre-ordered the game.

214
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:21,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Note to anyone buying anything from GameStop, if it has a code involved with it and it's not actually a Microsoft code where you download something off of their service, it's going to leak out immediately.

215
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:23,567
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fun.

216
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,608
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the Evil Cars code in there.

217
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:33,714
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a code to get a pocket bike and then you can do a code to make yourself even larger so it looks like you're just sitting down and driving that way.

218
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:35,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Explosions.

219
00:14:36,112 --> 00:14:36,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

220
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:39,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Reading some comments from chatroom about Beat and Groovy.

221
00:14:39,435 --> 00:14:45,600
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 says, When if I somehow get a job over the winter, I'll use the monies for a desktop arcade and one of the CS releases.

222
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that would probably be a better investment.

223
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:52,186
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Dysentery says, Well, props for Starmine at least.

224
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:52,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

225
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:55,629
[SPEAKER_09]: It does seem like they kind of tried to throw us a bone or two on the song list.

226
00:14:55,649 --> 00:14:56,870
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave us some really cool songs.

227
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:58,052
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah.

228
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:07,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, did you notice that the game's... I mean, I didn't even play it at all, but just from the videos, the game has, like, this urban vibe to it, and then there's super Eurobeat in there.

229
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,978
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like... Well, it's... You know what?

230
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:15,980
[SPEAKER_09]: This game wasn't... It's weird, because I feel like this game wasn't really made for America, even though it came out here.

231
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It definitely caters to the Japanese style.

232
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:24,644
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100 Matt says it tried to be like Boom Boom Rocket except it wasn't fun.

233
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:32,009
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of the whole thing though is that it wasn't trying to be Boom Boom Rocket because this game has been out for years and years before Boom Boom Rocket.

234
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:41,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that unfortunately that's the impression most people are going to have of this game because of the fact that it's lackluster in many many departments and it pains me to say that.

235
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:44,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there is a great game in there somewhere.

236
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played poppin' music 11, 12, 10, 8.

237
00:15:47,644 --> 00:15:49,527
[SPEAKER_09]: I've played tons of those poppin' music games.

238
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:51,710
[SPEAKER_09]: It's way fun, especially with that giant controller.

239
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,270
[SPEAKER_09]: This?

240
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:53,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Not fun.

241
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:57,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder if they just, you know, said, hey, um...

242
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:01,205
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it though is testing the waters?

243
00:16:29,904 --> 00:16:31,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they failed.

244
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,446
[SPEAKER_11]: For a potential release.

245
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:37,609
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what fucking bugs me about Konamiya Japan, is that they shouldn't have to.

246
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,773
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to see if a music game is going to do good here in America, fucking look at Guitar Hero and Rock Band.

247
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:49,797
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're not going to get... God, it just makes me angry how fucking dense they are in not understanding the music.

248
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:53,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they have a fucking cult based around these music games here in America.

249
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And they turn a blind eye to it all the time and release crap like this.

250
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:00,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it worked in Japan, so it must work in America.

251
00:17:01,024 --> 00:17:02,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten years ago it worked in Japan.

252
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:03,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Times have changed.

253
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:05,426
[SPEAKER_09]: The bar has been risen.

254
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:06,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Wake up.

255
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami of Japan, wake up.

256
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob for President 12.

257
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:17,192
[SPEAKER_09]: F that.

258
00:17:17,232 --> 00:17:18,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Make me CEO of Konami.

259
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go change some things real quick.

260
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:22,614
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

261
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:23,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

262
00:17:24,993 --> 00:17:26,014
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

263
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,790
[SPEAKER_09]: But it happens.

264
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Life gets in the way.

265
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not the only podcast that sometimes gets a little slow, so sorry about that.

266
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:05,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Always, there is our LiveJournal and MySpace and Facebook that we like to plug as well.

267
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:06,895
[SPEAKER_09]: MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.

268
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:09,316
[SPEAKER_09]: LiveJournal, Orange Lounge, and Facebook, OL Army.

269
00:18:09,596 --> 00:18:11,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to add us on those various sites.

270
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:12,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And Twitter now as well, OLR.

271
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:20,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll get to the pre-show OLR tweet question in just a little bit when we start talking about Tokyo Game Show, which I'm sure we're going to get to.

272
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:27,507
[SPEAKER_09]: During the news report, but first, some news out of the Tokyo Game Show that I'm kind of surprised wasn't announced here in America, right, Loki?

273
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:28,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

274
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, well, really the last U.S.

275
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:43,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft press conference that they had was pretty much at, well, I guess they could have done one at PAX, but it was pretty much at E3, and of course this game was rumored to have been...

276
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,871
[SPEAKER_07]: About to be announced at E3, but for whatever reason they stopped it.

277
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:53,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So they left it for Tokyo Game Show, and the course of that game is Halo 3 Recon.

278
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:59,734
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one that they were teasing with the Bungie little viral video thing that they released.

279
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Brand new teaser trailer.

280
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:04,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And Halo 3 Recon will be a standalone game.

281
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:06,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It includes new multiplayer maps.

282
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes place before Halo 3.

283
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,698
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually...

284
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:15,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

285
00:19:35,168 --> 00:19:35,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

286
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,310
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks kind of neat.

287
00:19:36,851 --> 00:19:39,454
[SPEAKER_07]: They announced it's going to be coming out in the fall of 2009.

288
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,960
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of surprising because I thought it was supposed to be coming out in the spring.

289
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Or at least it would have made more sense to come out in the spring, I think.

290
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

291
00:19:47,947 --> 00:19:50,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this is the next big Halo game that we're going to be getting.

292
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think it's going to do as well as Halo 3?

293
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:53,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

294
00:19:53,048 --> 00:19:57,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Halo 3 was... I think it was one of those games where the hype really killed it.

295
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:02,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, Halo 3, I think if it didn't have all that hype behind it, would have been pretty well received.

296
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:08,734
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think a lot of people grew tired of it really fast because there was so much hype around it and how it was just going to be so much better than Halo 2.

297
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:11,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it was like, eh, it's Halo 2, but prettier.

298
00:20:11,756 --> 00:20:16,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think this is going to do as well because I think it's running off the same engine and also the fact that...

299
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:25,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're a really big Halo fan, I don't know if you're going to enjoy much of the prologue to the whole Halo 3 stuff.

300
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:36,574
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, I played through Halo and I sort of know what was going on, and this doesn't seem that interesting to me.

301
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,919
[SPEAKER_09]: StarCraft 2 is getting split into three different games.

302
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,252
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe they're going to make us pay three full games.

303
00:21:06,272 --> 00:21:10,774
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one game for the price of three, and blah, blah, I'm getting shafted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.

304
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:14,716
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kind of look at this story about Halo 3 Recon, and I'm going, well, is this much different?

305
00:21:15,476 --> 00:21:18,458
[SPEAKER_07]: It is different because they've already had a full campaign for...

306
00:21:19,352 --> 00:21:19,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo 3, StarCraft 2,

307
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

308
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Another Halo 3!

309
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think it's cheap, though.

310
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, look at, like, Red Alert.

311
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:46,613
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a perfect example.

312
00:21:46,953 --> 00:21:50,315
[SPEAKER_07]: The game has a few different factions, and there's a storyline for each one.

313
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:53,377
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, other games have done it.

314
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:56,319
[SPEAKER_07]: They have, you know, multiple sides, and they have multiple storylines.

315
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,841
[SPEAKER_09]: But Halo 2's single-player mode was also done like that.

316
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo 3.

317
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, they're slightly lackluster.

318
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:04,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

319
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this should be download content.

320
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:10,369
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's going to be running off the same engine, just have it as a downloadable game, not this retail thing.

321
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:13,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now if it's retail, we can charge $59.99 for it.

322
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:18,796
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot more than you can charge for an Xbox expansion or something like that.

323
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:21,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

324
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:21,659
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just...

325
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:31,137
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time, I guess, Halo is going to be coming out, you know, Halo 3, by the time, you know, this new game comes out, Halo 3 will probably be like $29.99.

326
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:38,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be surprised if they do like a Game of the Year edition or something like that or, you know... Eventually it'll be combined.

327
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:40,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to combine them.

328
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:41,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

329
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:47,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we need one more game because, you know, what game... We need a trilogy to complete the trilogy.

330
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:48,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

331
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:48,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

332
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,188
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, who doesn't want three of something?

333
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:51,769
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

334
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:53,570
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rob D says...

335
00:23:08,784 --> 00:23:15,366
[SPEAKER_09]: If Halo 1 had different campaigns that were all free and Halo 2 didn't, people would be complaining about it just like they are about StarCraft.

336
00:23:15,446 --> 00:23:16,887
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even just two purchases.

337
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,507
[SPEAKER_09]: It's three purchases, triple the cost.

338
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:23,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says it's basically what I said last week with the ACDC track pack.

339
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:27,730
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says people are suckers, especially for Blizzard games.

340
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:41,516
[SPEAKER_07]: and, uh, let's see, um... It would be different if they had, like, you know, a storyline for all of them, like a campaign, and then later on they added a new expansion that had more storyline for all the campaigns or something like that.

341
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Break it up like that and have expansions.

342
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:44,357
[SPEAKER_07]: People can accept expansions.

343
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:50,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I just kind of think people are passing judgment on the StarCraft II thing too quickly without really seeing what each individual game has to offer.

344
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,121
[SPEAKER_09]: They're only looking at it at face value, going...

345
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:55,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, three different games, what?

346
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:58,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm just going, well, how is that different from most, you know?

347
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:00,866
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rob D brings up a good point.

348
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:03,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, FPSs have kind of done this for a long time.

349
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:07,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at, go back to the days of Shareware and Quake.

350
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Quake had, like, what, four different episodes?

351
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,353
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one was free, but you had to pay for each of the other ones individually.

352
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:21,688
[SPEAKER_07]: All the other four or the other three campaigns that were in there were part of the retail version.

353
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:27,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Shareware, it's just the same as saying, okay, you get one level in this demo and then you get the other 10 when you buy the full game.

354
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,812
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an excuse for just...

355
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,043
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, that's to get more money.

356
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:42,547
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole thing is probably, oh, our game's going to be pirated to hell, so we need to sell more copies.

357
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:43,888
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we sell more copies?

358
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:44,989
[SPEAKER_07]: We split it up into three.

359
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not a storage issue.

360
00:24:47,972 --> 00:24:49,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a time issue.

361
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:52,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you right now that these are probably not going to be very fleshed out.

362
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:57,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, how long can a strategy campaign last for?

363
00:24:57,441 --> 00:24:57,681
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

364
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very long, so great.

365
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just do one for each specific thing.

366
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,222
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to do something different, just do different packaging with different...

367
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Sides on it or something like that.

368
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,302
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, collector's editions type stuff.

369
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:16,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking a wait-and-see approach.

370
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:21,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, if games can be compared to movies, sometimes movies are released in three different parts.

371
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:24,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we still go see all three of them.

372
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the Star Wars trilogy, the new one.

373
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:30,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Matrix trilogy, even though that is questionable about its, you know, value.

374
00:25:30,756 --> 00:25:34,759
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, we'll pay three times to see the full movie.

375
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,141
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a full movie.

376
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:39,043
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like I'm watching, you know...

377
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a Batman movie, and one of the movies is from the perspective of Batman Do you not think StarCraft 2 is not going to be a full game?

378
00:25:47,985 --> 00:25:59,831
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think, well the way it sounds like now, I don't think each one is going to be a full game They're going to call them a full game, and it'll be a full campaign for one side But it's going to feel kind of cheap, because what's the other stuff?

379
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:04,834
[SPEAKER_07]: So say, what if I'm playing the first one and I want to play the campaign for something else?

380
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:05,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can't do that now

381
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, you gotta go buy the other one.

382
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:14,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, if you want to give us a comment on that, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or you can call us a little later on in the program.

383
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:21,149
[SPEAKER_09]: For now, though, we'll move on to some more gaming news, talking about 360 and some holiday bundles that are coming out.

384
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:21,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray!

385
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Free games now coming with your Xboxes.

386
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:24,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait.

387
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,292
[SPEAKER_09]: This is totally new news.

388
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, never heard this one before.

389
00:26:28,314 --> 00:26:41,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it has been confirmed, okay, that there is now a 199 arcade holiday bundle, and with it you will get Sega Superstars Tennis and five Xbox Live Arcade games that have not yet been announced.

390
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, I think the arcade games...

391
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:49,314
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been actually changing a little bit because I remember when I first bought an arcade to replace my broken system.

392
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:51,555
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a bunch of games with it now.

393
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:56,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got a new arcade system for my sister for her birthday and it had slightly different stuff.

394
00:26:56,536 --> 00:26:57,836
[SPEAKER_07]: They had Boom Boom Rocket in there.

395
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:08,539
[SPEAKER_07]: There was Pac-Man Championship Edition, Luxor 2, Feeding Frenzy, and... A sampling.

396
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:10,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same thing.

397
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:12,680
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I would say it's exactly the same thing because...

398
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:14,599
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,049
[SPEAKER_09]: The normal Xbox 360 is $2.99 or the Elite for $3.99.

400
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:46,290
[SPEAKER_09]: You get LEGO Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda for free.

401
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:52,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably those titles were selected because they're both rated E for everyone and it's the holidays.

402
00:27:52,214 --> 00:27:57,076
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to push this as a family system because that's one area where the Xbox 360 has always seemed to lack.

403
00:27:57,657 --> 00:27:59,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And to be fair, those games are actually pretty good.

404
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

405
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:24,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Reading a comment from Redertainment from the last story about Blizzard, and we kind of got in that little disagreement there.

406
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:27,635
[SPEAKER_09]: All companies want to make as much money as humanly possible.

407
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:31,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Blizzard thinks they can make mad bucks on this deal, so they are going to go through with it.

408
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:35,040
[SPEAKER_09]: If the community says en masse that this is not the case, they will change their plans.

409
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:36,882
[SPEAKER_09]: But the community won't.

410
00:28:37,222 --> 00:28:37,622
[SPEAKER_09]: You know it.

411
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it.

412
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:46,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just like the community bitched and moaned, well, I should say a few individuals bitched and moaned about the Diablo 3 art style, and we got a t-shirt out of it, at least.

413
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

414
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:49,172
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

415
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:56,836
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so anyhow, yeah, so if you haven't gotten your Xbox 360 yet, you might want to wait until those package deals show up because, hey, free games.

416
00:28:57,316 --> 00:28:58,536
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to complain about free games.

417
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:00,837
[SPEAKER_07]: They should be out there now, I think.

418
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:03,018
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more than I got when I got my Xbox 360.

419
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:08,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, how about something that makes me super excited about the Xbox 360?

420
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:14,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Barbie Horse Princess Part 2 They're making a babysitting game in there?

421
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:19,444
[SPEAKER_11]: To quote Patty from Twitter earlier, Diana Napalm Fire

422
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:20,747
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

423
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:25,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Tekken 6 is going to be out on Xbox 360 in fall 2009.

424
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,734
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes me super happy.

425
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:30,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Super, super happy.

426
00:29:30,676 --> 00:29:32,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Because then I don't have to get it on PlayStation 3.

427
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,540
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I don't know, I might get it on PlayStation 3.

428
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,841
[SPEAKER_11]: But I love Tekken.

429
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:39,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I am the world's biggest Tekken fangirl.

430
00:29:40,024 --> 00:29:44,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And according to Microsoft, it's going to be out in fall 2009.

431
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:48,571
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I don't know if it was ever announced that it was an exclusive, but that's one less exclusive that they get.

432
00:29:49,412 --> 00:30:04,938
[SPEAKER_11]: It was considered to be before PS3 exclusive, especially given that one of the demos for the PlayStation 3 was actually renderings of Jin from the Tekken series.

433
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:11,320
[SPEAKER_11]: This was actually confirmed at the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2008 press conference for Namco Bandai.

434
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious, as a Tekken fangirl, how you feel about this announcement about Tekken going bi.

435
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:20,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And by bi, I mean, of course, bi-systemal.

436
00:30:20,983 --> 00:30:27,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I had another friend of mine who's pretty into Tekken who was like, wow, that is big news for Tekken to not come out on a Sony system only.

437
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:28,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That's huge.

438
00:30:29,347 --> 00:30:29,767
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it is.

439
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:30,207
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

440
00:30:31,688 --> 00:30:40,471
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, in the past, as far as I'm aware, every American Tekken release has been out on a Sony system.

441
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:49,225
[SPEAKER_11]: There has been a Tekken Cardfighter game that came out in Japan on Wonderswan.

442
00:30:50,185 --> 00:30:51,967
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, that's Bandai System.

443
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:53,067
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't count the spin-offs.

444
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:57,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we'd have to count Death by Degrees and no one wants to remember that game.

445
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:02,393
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, that's also in the Tekken franchise and it did only come out for...

446
00:31:03,314 --> 00:31:04,194
[SPEAKER_11]: PlayStation 2, right?

447
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:05,515
[SPEAKER_11]: True.

448
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:12,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I do believe, if I'm correct, there's only ever been one Tekken game that came out on a non-Sony system.

449
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:14,138
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was the WonderSwan.

450
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:18,920
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, a lot of Sony franchises did come out on the WonderSwan.

451
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:30,244
[SPEAKER_11]: For them to give that much of a nod to the Xbox 360 I think is very, very big.

452
00:31:30,706 --> 00:31:32,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the chatters just want to throw this out there.

453
00:31:32,728 --> 00:31:36,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Alpha Cananogram and HitStun want to remind you there was Tekken Advance on Game Boy Advance.

454
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,351
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

455
00:31:36,371 --> 00:31:37,512
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the other one I was trying to think of.

456
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:39,213
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually do have that one too.

457
00:31:39,713 --> 00:31:47,600
[SPEAKER_11]: So out of, let's see, five games tag tournament, there were only two other games that came out.

458
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Resurrection came out on... With all due respect, these other two games weren't real Tekken games, quote unquote.

459
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:59,750
[SPEAKER_09]: These other ones we're thinking of are arcade ports, the base Tekken series.

460
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:05,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Resurrection was an actual Tekken game, but that came out on PSP.

461
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,056
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to read a comment from chat.

462
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:13,640
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw in chat says, Namco has pretty much slapped Sony in the face by becoming multi-platform.

463
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Tekken has been a PlayStation exclusive since day one.

464
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:21,566
[SPEAKER_11]: That pretty much was it.

465
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:28,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially when you had all your PlayStation releases have the compatibility with each other to go back and look at your movies and everything.

466
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:38,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do think that it's a really big deal.

467
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:52,466
[SPEAKER_11]: On top of that, I think it's also going to be... I'm not calling it a nail in the coffin for Sony, but I think it's definitely a major wake-up call that they're not doing something right.

468
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:56,249
[SPEAKER_11]: They had been doing right when the PlayStation came out.

469
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:58,450
[SPEAKER_11]: They had been doing right when the PS2 came out.

470
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I right?

471
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:00,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

472
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are both fantastic systems.

473
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:08,265
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as their sales went, their marketing strategy, as far as them coming out over the top of the competition.

474
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,308
[SPEAKER_11]: And now they're sliding.

475
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Now they're falling into the Sega pit.

476
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:14,571
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX 360

477
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is going to mean a hill of beans in Japan.

478
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:44,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I think most people will still get it for PS3.

479
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:47,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind though, the Saturn did very well in Japan.

480
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:48,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, true.

481
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,670
[SPEAKER_11]: But did they have the right support over here?

482
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:19,491
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

483
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:21,913
[SPEAKER_11]: And what's happening to the PlayStation 3 now?

484
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:23,395
[SPEAKER_11]: It's losing its support.

485
00:34:23,735 --> 00:34:25,256
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not doing something right.

486
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:29,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the PlayStation 3 is always going to be a Blu-ray player that plays games.

487
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,502
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I agree.

488
00:34:31,522 --> 00:34:32,924
[SPEAKER_09]: This will not put Sony out of business.

489
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:34,985
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be a PS4, but we just kind of hope they...

490
00:34:36,062 --> 00:34:45,592
[SPEAKER_11]: If they do a PS4, I think the PS4, they're going to have to turn some shit around before they can actually make it anything that's viable for their company to bring out.

491
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:47,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Else they're just going to have to go back to making TVs.

492
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:52,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're getting a little too much into the whole console war now.

493
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:55,402
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, GS68, bless you for Segata Sanshiro.

494
00:34:57,744 --> 00:34:59,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Segata Sanshiro was awesome.

495
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:00,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

496
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:04,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go back to some more gaming news that I think will also make a lot of folks happy.

497
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:05,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

498
00:35:05,613 --> 00:35:10,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, of course there are many games coming to both consoles out there.

499
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:22,238
[SPEAKER_07]: But one date that they did announce was the release of the brand new Resident Evil 5 that will be coming to consoles March 12th.

500
00:35:23,118 --> 00:35:26,999
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course that will be coming to the 360 and on the PS3.

501
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:29,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all sorts of awesome.

502
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:32,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

503
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:55,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

504
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of people like to hate on 99 Nights.

505
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:17,412
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think the game was awful.

506
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:20,393
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of how I feel about Beat and Groovy in some ways.

507
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:21,413
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, I don't know.

508
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:28,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that same feeling of 99 Nights, there's a good game in there somewhere, but there were just a few flaws that kind of kept it from being great.

509
00:36:28,476 --> 00:36:30,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, look at Dynasty Warriors.

510
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:31,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does that game sell?

511
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:34,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, literally, seriously, they put out...

512
00:36:35,598 --> 00:36:36,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

513
00:36:57,287 --> 00:37:01,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Your average consumer is going to look at all three of those and go, I don't get it.

514
00:37:02,274 --> 00:37:02,875
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the difference?

515
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, that's kind of like with this game.

516
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,443
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically like a Dynasty Warriors clone.

517
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:11,587
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next one comes out, I'm not expecting they're going to change much.

518
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully fix some things and that's it.

519
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, they only need to fix a few more things for this game to actually be pretty kick-ass.

520
00:37:17,493 --> 00:37:18,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoy myself.

521
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:18,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the game.

522
00:37:19,234 --> 00:37:20,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma says, Sky, don't you have 99 Nights?

523
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:20,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

524
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:21,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought it the day it came out.

525
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:26,200
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm also, you have to remember, I'm also a whore for Q Entertainment.

526
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,080
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

527
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:30,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything Mizuguchi does, I'm gonna buy.

528
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he's one of my favorite game designers.

529
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:33,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Except Gunpei.

530
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I never got Gunpei for some reason, but it's on my list.

531
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:39,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine how awesome Beat and Groovy would have been if Q Entertainment had made it?

532
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:40,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Pfft.

533
00:37:41,491 --> 00:38:09,366
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Q Entertainment should make a game done right anyway anyway that's for another day but obviously 99 Nights as much as I want to say it's not as bad as y'all think okay definitely the game had it's flaws it did get boring after a while I just hope they can fix some of it with 99 Nights too there's a good game in there somewhere and I hope people don't totally pass it off on name alone because hey sometimes games don't get really really good until the sequel for instance Mega Man

534
00:38:10,086 --> 00:38:11,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Mega Man 2 Mega Man 2 Mega Man 2 Mega Man 2

535
00:38:41,426 --> 00:38:43,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week there's some damn rumor about it, yes.

536
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here is the official word.

537
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:47,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Dun, dun, dun.

538
00:38:48,571 --> 00:38:52,815
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a quote from one of Microsoft's representatives.

539
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:59,300
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, As we've said before, Microsoft has no plans to introduce an Xbox 360 Blu-ray add-on.

540
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:07,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Games are what drive consumers to purchase game consoles, and we remain focused on providing the largest library of blockbuster games available.

541
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:09,549
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's a direct quote.

542
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:14,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Allow me to translate to all the bloggers around America and throughout the world, really.

543
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:14,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to provide my translation.

544
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:15,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, please, go ahead.

545
00:39:15,792 --> 00:39:16,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut the fuck up!

546
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:18,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what I was gonna say.

547
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:22,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut the fuck up about the Blu-ray on Microsoft.

548
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:24,095
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not happening.

549
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:30,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it is gonna happen, we'll fucking tell you a long time from now because it's just not something we're interested in right now.

550
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:38,222
[SPEAKER_11]: The whole thing that brought that up was that there had been a rumor that Microsoft had commissioned the hardware to be made with a Toshiba Samsung.

551
00:39:39,203 --> 00:39:41,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, no!

552
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:42,549
[SPEAKER_11]: And you wanna know what?

553
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I love my HD DVD player on it.

554
00:39:45,054 --> 00:39:50,104
[SPEAKER_11]: But, going back to what I was previously saying about what Sony is doing wrong...

555
00:39:51,178 --> 00:39:53,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's what Sony's doing wrong.

556
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,740
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not focusing on the games.

557
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,942
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what Microsoft is doing right.

558
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:01,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, but is that necessarily a bad thing?

559
00:40:01,403 --> 00:40:05,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I look at the PSP and I go, eh, not my favorite gaming system first.

560
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:08,547
[SPEAKER_09]: But the PSP does a lot of cool shit that I like.

561
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:10,408
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like an all-in-one little device.

562
00:40:10,428 --> 00:40:15,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I can name people off the top of my head who've bought the PSP not as a gaming system but as a multimedia system.

563
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:15,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

564
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,813
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I think handheld game system, I think of my DS.

565
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:19,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

566
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:26,266
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's so wrong with the PlayStation 3 taking that same kind of concept about being a home entertainment device?

567
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:32,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when someone's going to buy a console, it is going to be because they can play games on it.

568
00:40:33,168 --> 00:40:37,311
[SPEAKER_11]: That is, I think, the end all of what a video game console is.

569
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:45,377
[SPEAKER_11]: It can have all these nice, pretty special bells and whistles, but in the end, no matter what, what do we always say?

570
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,119
[SPEAKER_11]: The console is only as good as the games that are on it.

571
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,984
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're not putting good games on it, what good is the damn console other than just playing a movie?

572
00:40:54,545 --> 00:40:59,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I know somebody who owns a PlayStation 3 for nothing but Blu-ray.

573
00:40:59,828 --> 00:41:02,889
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't own a single video game, just the Blu-ray player because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.

574
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,770
[SPEAKER_11]: It's astounding.

575
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,651
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, what's the point?

576
00:41:07,527 --> 00:41:09,088
[SPEAKER_11]: You can buy Blu-ray players.

577
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:16,710
[SPEAKER_09]: One other thing I kind of want to point out, you know, Microsoft has a high-definition movie download service and they're rolling out Netflix pretty soon.

578
00:41:17,631 --> 00:41:19,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they really want a Blu-ray player?

579
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably not.

580
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:24,673
[SPEAKER_09]: They probably want to go to this whole digital distribution thing because there's a lot of money to be made there.

581
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:25,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's where it's going.

582
00:41:25,433 --> 00:41:27,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I really do think that that's the future of our media.

583
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:35,877
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised that 10 years down the line, you'll have a hard time picking up physical media.

584
00:41:36,057 --> 00:41:38,098
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all going to be downloadable content.

585
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:39,519
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

586
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you have it.

587
00:41:40,419 --> 00:41:41,039
[SPEAKER_09]: No Blu-ray.

588
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:43,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just stop spreading rumors about it.

589
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up, please.

590
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:50,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Meantime, though, we got a lot of other releases coming out that are confirmed and will be happening.

591
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

592
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:55,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's plenty of stuff coming out because we're now in the fourth quarter of

593
00:41:55,605 --> 00:41:58,489
[SPEAKER_07]: which is where all the game companies like to hide their games.

594
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:06,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And starting off, and of course there's a lot of crap out there, Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune for the Wii.

595

596
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:11,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And Avatar, please tell us how you really feel.

597
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:13,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, let me put it this way.

598
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:16,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's by a company called Zoo Games, and all their games have sucked.

599
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:20,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Avatar, The Last Airbender, Into the Inferno.

600
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:26,512

00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:30,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll be out on the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.

656
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:53,004
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a casual game, okay?

673
00:47:57,226 --> 00:48:04,911
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that is, again, just like last week on the other systems, that's Guitar Hero 3 by itself because I think the bundle was all they had for a while.

674
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:05,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

675

00:50:26,949 --> 00:50:28,349
[SPEAKER_11]: So, that would be it.

690
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:30,970
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's coming out here in a few weeks, too.

691
00:50:31,991 --> 00:50:34,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I have absolutely zero interest in that.

692
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:34,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you know what?

693
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,032
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a kitchen and I have food.

694
00:50:37,532 --> 00:50:38,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know how to cook.

695
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:40,153
[SPEAKER_11]: I have Iron Chef.

696
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:42,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the Iron Chef book.

697
00:50:42,894 --> 00:50:43,534
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

698
00:50:43,694 --> 00:50:44,434
[SPEAKER_11]: That little red book?

699
00:50:44,854 --> 00:50:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

700
00:50:45,255 --> 00:50:45,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that great?

701
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:49,336
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to actually try making the humbar lobster dish that was in there.

702
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,216
[SPEAKER_11]: If I have $1,000.

703
00:50:51,336 --> 00:50:52,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough about Iron Chef.

704
00:50:53,557 --> 00:50:56,038
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we are going to talk about Iron Chef, the secret ingredient is...

705
00:50:56,718 --> 00:51:03,162
[SPEAKER_07]: More skins for LittleBigPlanet and GameStop is sweetening the deal with their pre-orders.

706
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:11,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Before you could get your Kratos skin on or at least the different parts of it to create your own Kratos Sackboy.

707
00:51:12,308 --> 00:51:20,933
[SPEAKER_07]: But now you'll be getting also a Medusa, looks like a skin set there, and costumes for, looks like a Minotaur.

708
00:51:21,974 --> 00:51:22,915
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty awesome.

709
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:28,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And those will be available when the game is released a couple weeks from now.

710
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty sweet.

711
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:32,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, Tokyo Game Show.

712
00:51:33,243 --> 00:51:34,964
[SPEAKER_07]: They were showing off a few more things.

713

[SPEAKER_07]: Skins for Solid Snake from, of course, Metal Gear Solid.

714
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,733
[SPEAKER_07]: And from Final Fantasy VII, they have Sephiroth.

715
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:47,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, joy.

716
00:51:49,016 --> 00:51:49,636
[SPEAKER_07]: No cloud, though.

717
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:50,497
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand why.

718
00:51:50,967 --> 00:51:51,808
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you going to have a battle?

719
00:51:51,888 --> 00:51:52,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, you know what that means.

720
00:51:52,889 --> 00:51:55,331
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a Final Fantasy VII remake on PlayStation 3.

721
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:55,851
[SPEAKER_09]: This is proof.

722
00:51:57,653 --> 00:51:59,114
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to be done with Sackboys.

723
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:03,678
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Potter Puppet Pals, but for the next gen.

724
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:05,620
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be the best game ever.

725
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,601
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually would be kind of awesome.

726
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:08,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy Puppet Pals.

727
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:10,123
[SPEAKER_11]: The game.

728
00:52:10,224 --> 00:52:10,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very awesome.

729
00:52:12,345 --> 00:52:12,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool, cool.

730
00:52:13,366 --> 00:52:15,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have your LittleBigPlanet pre-ordered?

731
00:52:15,548 --> 00:52:16,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you getting this, Loki?

732
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:16,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am.

733
00:52:18,686 --> 00:52:20,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment in chat is kind of pissed.

734
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:20,867
[SPEAKER_09]: He says Sephiroth?

735
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:21,367
[SPEAKER_09]: No Cloud?

736
00:52:21,387 --> 00:52:21,908
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck?

737
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:23,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it time.

738
00:52:23,949 --> 00:52:24,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Cloud will be later.

739
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:28,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Cloud comes with your Final Fantasy VII Remake pre-order.

740
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:28,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh.

741
00:52:29,572 --> 00:52:29,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

742
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:33,614
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, speaking of LittleBigPlanet, some other news.

743
00:52:34,294 --> 00:52:40,338
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a little bit of will they, won't they with the beta and will the levels made in the beta be playable in the final game?

744
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:42,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And the answer is... Unicron.

745
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:44,787
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the answer is yes.

746
00:52:45,688 --> 00:52:55,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was confirmed to 1UP because they're able to get confirmations from big developers that indeed the things that people have been making in the beta, they will transfer over to the final game.

747
00:52:57,076 --> 00:53:03,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, though, they're kind of gauging how people feel about this news on the official PlayStation forums, so they might change their mind.

748
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you not like this idea?

749
00:53:05,563 --> 00:53:07,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they want everybody to start on the same page.

750
00:53:08,305 --> 00:53:09,306
[SPEAKER_09]: That's dumb.

751
00:53:09,326 --> 00:53:11,588
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have access to all the same stuff in the beta, right?

752
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:16,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd say it's win-win, because you start the game, there's a ton of fucking content to download.

753
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:17,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

754
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:18,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would that be bad?

755
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:19,310
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

756
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I can play Bobby's level.

757
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf, of course, the man who does the show before us here on All Games Radio, he actually made a little level that's cute.

758
00:53:27,012 --> 00:53:30,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the quest, because there's a YouTube of it somewhere, if you look up his YouTube account.

759
00:53:31,013 --> 00:53:33,013
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like the quest to get a beta code.

760
00:53:33,393 --> 00:53:33,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's funny.

761
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:34,473
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cute.

762
00:53:34,493 --> 00:53:35,594
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of shows what you can do with the game.

763
00:53:35,934 --> 00:53:36,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know...

764
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:40,116
[SPEAKER_09]: We had that little demo at Penny Arcade Expo and kind of got to play the game.

765
00:53:40,136 --> 00:53:41,497
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't get to see a lot of the editor.

766
00:53:41,877 --> 00:53:44,018
[SPEAKER_09]: We really didn't get to see a lot about editing the levels.

767
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:46,359
[SPEAKER_09]: It was kind of cool to see what you can really create.

768
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:48,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how much time he spent on that, but I imagine it wasn't that much.

769
00:53:50,501 --> 00:53:53,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the Wall of Awesome levels in there with my picture on it.

770
00:53:53,923 --> 00:53:54,303
[SPEAKER_07]: What levels?

771
00:53:54,503 --> 00:53:54,704
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

772
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:55,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember?

773
00:53:55,684 --> 00:53:58,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I beat the developer at that little mini game thing that he did.

774
00:53:59,186 --> 00:53:59,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

775
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:01,007
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a picture on the Wall of Awesome.

776
00:54:01,667 --> 00:54:02,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, maybe.

777
00:54:02,728 --> 00:54:04,269
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe that was just for Penny Arcade Expo.

778
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:04,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

779
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:05,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

780
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:06,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Perhaps.

781
00:54:07,105 --> 00:54:07,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

782
00:54:08,566 --> 00:54:09,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

783
00:54:10,006 --> 00:54:10,726
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be looking for that.

784
00:54:11,387 --> 00:54:15,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm finally going to have to crack and buy a PlayStation 3 in a couple weeks, finally, I think, because I do want this game.

785
00:54:19,129 --> 00:54:20,630
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just thinking about that, actually.

786
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:21,150
[SPEAKER_09]: How so?

787
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:24,411
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that was for SingStar, right?

788
00:54:25,071 --> 00:54:26,112
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, for LittleBigPlanet.

789
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:28,053
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.

790
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:29,813
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was thinking about SingStar, though.

791
00:54:30,093 --> 00:54:32,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've also, okay, because I've also talked about... Because you wanted the ABBA.

792
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:34,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, because I want SingStar ABBA, so...

793
00:54:35,503 --> 00:54:39,646
[SPEAKER_11]: My brain was doing that thing where it jumps topics without me actually saying anything about it.

794
00:54:40,007 --> 00:54:40,587
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's fine.

795
00:54:40,607 --> 00:54:41,468
[SPEAKER_09]: I have said that before.

796
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:43,689
[SPEAKER_11]: But I was thinking about that.

797
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Are those the only two games that you're interested in to get the system?

798
00:54:49,133 --> 00:54:51,175
[SPEAKER_09]: For right now, but I'm also interested in Home.

799
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:54,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Home's going to be kind of cool.

800
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see what kind of comes up next year.

801
00:54:56,899 --> 00:54:59,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just wondering if that would really be your only two reasons.

802
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:00,541
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

803
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:03,120
[SPEAKER_09]: and the fact it's a Blu-ray player.

804
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I can benefit from that too.

805
00:55:04,982 --> 00:55:06,263
[SPEAKER_09]: There's enough for me.

806
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:10,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we've been discussing the PSP earlier.

807
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:13,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's something that we finally have a confirmation on.

808
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:21,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Yoshida Shuhei has said it himself that Gran Turismo PSP is in development but

809
00:55:24,703 --> 00:55:27,225
[SPEAKER_11]: There's actually no real date on it yet.

810
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:33,309
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, according to this article, when he was asked about it, he actually said, good question.

811
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,572
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in Polyphony Digital, and they're working on it.

812
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:43,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So at any rate, they say that the reason that it's been delayed is because Polyphony's been working on other projects.

813
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:51,442
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have been working on Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Gran Turismo 5 for PS3.

814
00:55:52,022 --> 00:56:01,068
[SPEAKER_11]: So they were actually working on the PS3 as their priority and not the PSP one.

815
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:06,231
[SPEAKER_11]: But when he was asked when it would be, he said, no comment.

816
00:56:07,692 --> 00:56:14,377
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a lame excuse, I think, because this has been in development since before the PSP was released.

817
00:56:15,345 --> 00:56:16,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So come on, man.

818
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:17,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

819
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:20,187
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been in development for a long time now.

820
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:21,768
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be out when Duke Nukem Forever is out.

821
00:56:22,028 --> 00:56:24,369
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to make the graphics extra pretty, remember?

822
00:56:24,749 --> 00:56:25,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my ass.

823
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:38,636
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like they were saying, Oh, well, we don't know how to make the cars take damage and stuff, and the car manufacturers don't want us to dirty up their cars and stuff yet.

824
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:43,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Other games have the same licensed cars and realistic damage modeling.

825
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:53,740
[SPEAKER_07]: excuses, excuses, excuses and you know what, by the time your stupid game is released, no one will care the end the end

826
00:56:55,188 --> 00:57:02,253
[SPEAKER_07]: But one thing you can do in the meantime with your PSP, since you won't be playing Gran Turismo on it, is you can use it as a secondary monitor.

827
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:20,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to the Homebrew community, they have released an app, and I know there's another one out there that's also part of something else that can do the same thing, but PSP DISP version 0.1 allows you to connect your PSP to your PC via the USB cable and use it as a secondary monitor.

828
00:57:20,765 --> 00:57:23,767
[SPEAKER_07]: It's able to display graphics.

829
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:24,768
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you fit on it?

830
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:49,994
[SPEAKER_07]: graphics of 960 by 544 it's just you have to kind of move the you know pan the image around but you can do that and you can it's supported of course only on the custom firmwares of course you know 4.01 m33 so above so wait while I have like let's say while I have World of Warcraft going on my main computer screen I could have wow head up in a browser window on my secondary screen yes that's kind of neat

831
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:54,726
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cheap.

832
00:57:54,966 --> 00:57:58,607
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good for visualizations or whatever.

833
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:02,168
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're working on something and you want to view something on your other screen.

834
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:04,869
[SPEAKER_07]: What if you're designing a PSP website?

835
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:08,410
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't work.

836
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:13,392
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP doesn't display stuff quite like... You see what I was trying to get at though.

837
00:58:13,652 --> 00:58:19,974
[SPEAKER_09]: You've designed the lovely olrpsp.com which includes the all games radio player so you can listen to us on your PSP live on Sunday nights.

838
00:58:20,623 --> 00:58:25,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, unfortunately the PSP does not display stuff the same as your PC.

839
00:58:25,648 --> 00:58:31,775
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it kind of difficult because you have to constantly tweak stuff and then refresh, tweak stuff, refresh.

840
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:39,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look, one thing that you're going to be able to enjoy a lot more on your PSP, and it doesn't even have to run custom firmware...

841
00:58:39,944 --> 00:58:41,385
[SPEAKER_09]: and LocoRoco2.

842
00:58:41,706 --> 00:58:45,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, you knew it was coming because Sony really hyped up the first LocoRoco game.

843
00:58:45,949 --> 00:58:46,690
[SPEAKER_09]: You knew it was coming.

844
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,151
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's kind of interesting though?

845
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:51,174
[SPEAKER_09]: The game has also been confirmed for Europe as well as Japan.

846
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:52,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, we all know it's going there.

847
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:57,139
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is that actually the game is going to be coming out first in Europe.

848
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,361
[SPEAKER_09]: The game is coming out in November.

849
00:58:59,581 --> 00:59:00,042
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

850
00:59:00,482 --> 00:59:05,165
[SPEAKER_09]: November in Europe and no date announced yet for Japan as far as I know.

851
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:07,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it might be early next year.

852
00:59:08,228 --> 00:59:12,791
[SPEAKER_09]: So those of you folks over in Europe that always complain you get the shaft, Sony loves you!

853
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:14,732
[SPEAKER_09]: They're giving you LocoRoco 2 first.

854
00:59:15,673 --> 00:59:16,053
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

855
00:59:17,274 --> 00:59:18,515
[SPEAKER_11]: LocoRoco is awesome.

856
00:59:20,276 --> 00:59:23,521
[SPEAKER_09]: No word about the American release, though, which is kind of sad.

857
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:24,342
[SPEAKER_11]: We better get it.

858
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:25,223
[SPEAKER_11]: I would think that we did.

859
00:59:25,364 --> 00:59:26,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see why we wouldn't.

860
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:27,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It did so much better here than it did there.

861
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:28,428
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is when.

862
00:59:28,488 --> 00:59:29,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Will we have to wait till last?

863
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:30,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Will we be in between?

864
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:32,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, LocoRoco came out here last time.

865
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:34,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait, no, that's Patapon.

866
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:34,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

867
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:36,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is also getting a sequel.

868
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,221
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what Actdeft just said in chat.

869
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:39,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat.org.com.

870
00:59:39,301 --> 00:59:40,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Patapon 2 is also coming.

871
00:59:40,602 --> 00:59:40,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

872
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:41,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Pon, pon, patapon.

873
00:59:43,643 --> 00:59:46,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, our next bit of news makes me super happy.

874
00:59:47,245 --> 00:59:49,987
[SPEAKER_11]: That is, if it doesn't suck as much as some of the other later releases did.

875
00:59:50,147 --> 00:59:53,569
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's going to be a new Castlevania game on PS3 and Xbox 360.

876
00:59:54,709 --> 01:00:01,012
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's... They actually showed about 10 seconds of footage of it.

877
01:00:01,813 --> 01:00:01,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

878
01:00:02,573 --> 01:00:03,754
[SPEAKER_11]: and no gameplay.

879
01:00:03,974 --> 01:00:04,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It was nothing.

880
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,037
[SPEAKER_11]: It's being produced by Igarashi and he's my hero and I got to meet him.

881
01:00:09,538 --> 01:00:10,258
[SPEAKER_11]: It made me so happy.

882
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,220
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe it's going to be good.

883
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:20,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually more excited about the other one that's coming out on handheld.

884
01:00:22,005 --> 01:00:23,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, Order of Elysia.

885
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:24,767
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah!

886
01:00:25,267 --> 01:00:29,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Itagashi and Itagaki should get together and form a death metal band.

887
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be awesome.

888
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:31,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you think?

889
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:33,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Idagaki and Igarashi?

890
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:37,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Igarashi and Idagaki.

891
01:00:37,082 --> 01:00:39,504
[SPEAKER_09]: The Dead or Alive guy and the Castlevania guy should get together and form a death metal band.

892
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:40,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, he's such a rock star.

893
01:00:40,325 --> 01:00:41,886
[SPEAKER_11]: He's on the picture here.

894
01:00:41,926 --> 01:00:42,226
[SPEAKER_09]: They are.

895
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:46,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Wearing a leather cowboy hat and holding a whip.

896
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,950
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, dude, you're hot.

897
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Mizuguchi can play keyboards.

898
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:53,014
[SPEAKER_09]: And then who'd be the singer?

899
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:54,555
[SPEAKER_09]: What game designer would be the singer for that band?

900
01:00:54,575 --> 01:00:55,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Posting the picture in the chat room?

901
01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:57,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, dude, I'm sorry.

902
01:00:58,197 --> 01:00:59,398
[SPEAKER_11]: He looks like a freaking rock star.

903
01:01:00,419 --> 01:01:01,540
[SPEAKER_09]: He is a freaking rock star.

904
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:06,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm thinking... Yes, and Dark Tasuya says, and do a game.

905
01:01:06,055 --> 01:01:07,415
[SPEAKER_09]: They should all come together and do a game.

906
01:01:08,056 --> 01:01:10,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I would die of... I would have a fangasm right there.

907
01:01:10,277 --> 01:01:11,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but they would never agree.

908
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:14,560
[SPEAKER_09]: They would kill each other first.

909
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:23,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I bet if you gave them both the same premise of the game, we'd get something fucked up from both of them, but in different ways.

910
01:01:24,726 --> 01:01:27,307
[SPEAKER_09]: TheRobD says Miyamoto would be the conductor.

911
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:29,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Inafume is the singer.

912
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:31,390
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

913
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:33,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we'll see.

914
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:38,781
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, before our dream game designer death metal band becomes true, we'll see probably Castlevania.

915
01:01:38,801 --> 01:01:40,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Current gen.

916
01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:43,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Idagaki is the Gene Simmons of the gaming world.

917
01:01:44,924 --> 01:01:45,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

918
01:01:45,885 --> 01:01:47,746
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gene Simmons of the gaming world.

919
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:48,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

920
01:01:48,506 --> 01:01:49,427
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs a reality show.

921
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:50,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

922
01:01:52,028 --> 01:01:52,208
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP Plus

923
01:02:14,217 --> 01:02:37,217
[SPEAKER_07]: and using Resistance Retribution via USB cable connecting it to your PS3 you will actually be able to use your DualShock 3 controller and play the game just using that and then you can also unlock abilities that are in Resistance 2, the character in that game

924
01:02:37,897 --> 01:02:56,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Nathan Hale you'll be able to unlock the same abilities for your character in this game and will also allow you to get to different parts of levels and stuff like that kind of think a little bit like the stuff they have with Sonic & Knuckles where you can plug in the other Sonic games and get to different portions of the game and stuff like that so that's kind of cool

925
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:07,883
[SPEAKER_07]: and I guess this would also fix that problem with not having the second analog stick because it does change the controls around since you have that second analog stick to look around.

926
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:16,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Or how about they just redesign the PSP with a second analog stick instead of having this roundabout way that requires a PlayStation 3 as well.

927
01:03:19,767 --> 01:03:20,428
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check it out though.

928
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:23,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean you're still going to get this game no matter what, right?

929
01:03:23,428 --> 01:03:24,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Resistance 2 will.

930
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:24,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

931
01:03:26,265 --> 01:03:30,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, also, moving on to one more story on the PSP, and then we're going to get towards our break time tonight.

932
01:03:30,868 --> 01:03:33,150
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PSP, there is the Wi-Fi store.

933
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:34,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember we've been talking about the Wi-Fi store this coming?

934
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, the date has been announced.

935
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:42,916
[SPEAKER_09]: October 15th, the Wi-Fi store will be launched in Japan, but you know that it's not much longer before it's here.

936
01:03:43,356 --> 01:03:49,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And that probably is in line with the fact that the PSP 3000 comes out this week as well, so don't think there's not a correlation there.

937
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:50,461
[SPEAKER_07]: With the 5.5?

938
01:03:51,942 --> 01:03:54,203
[SPEAKER_07]: 5.0 firmware will also be the same time.

939
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:57,765
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wi-Fi store is already on the box art for the PSP 3000.

940
01:03:58,766 --> 01:04:04,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Which makes sense because if the PSP 3000 doesn't hit street until October 16th, they're basically launching this the day before.

941
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:05,330
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

942
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:09,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Some games that are going to be sold on the store that already are dated.

943
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:16,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Secret Agent Clank on November 20th, Patapon 2 on November 27th, and LocoRoco 2 on December 4th.

944
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:18,399
[SPEAKER_09]: There's that date I was looking for earlier.

945
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, Europe's getting it by a couple weeks.

946
01:04:21,521 --> 01:04:22,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll see you next time.

947
01:04:35,803 --> 01:04:41,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually those firmware updates, they're all about the same time, like within a day of each other.

948
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:48,806
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so anyhow, the Wi-Fi store is going to be opening soon, and also opening soon is Part B of our show.

949
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:54,367
[SPEAKER_09]: But before we get to Part B of our radio show, we need to get to the classic video game of the week.

950
01:04:54,667 --> 01:05:01,989
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little segment we do here every week on this program where DarkSakura takes a look through history's past to find a game for us to look at.

951
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:07,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So tell us, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?

952
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:13,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if anyone could guess from the music... They won't hear that on the podcast, by the way.

953
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:15,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to edit that little boo-boo out.

954
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:20,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then I would totally give them a cookie, you know, a virtual cookie.

955
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:24,069
[SPEAKER_11]: But the game of the week is K.O.U.

956
01:05:24,089 --> 01:05:27,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Gekitai, which came out over here as Chaos Flying Squadron.

957
01:05:29,552 --> 01:05:39,480
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a game of a girl who has this ancestral obligation to go destroy monsters while riding on the back of her lazy little dragon friend.

958
01:05:40,701 --> 01:05:42,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Her dragon is named Pulchi.

959
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:49,889
[SPEAKER_11]: In the American version and the UK version, he was called Spot.

960
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:52,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny, I don't see a Spot.

961
01:05:53,786 --> 01:05:59,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Her special outfit, though, that she has to wear for destroying evil is a bunny girl suit.

962
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:05,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um... It came out... We actually got it as K.O.

963
01:06:05,355 --> 01:06:09,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Flying Squadron on the Sega CD over here.

964
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:10,699
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also K.O.

965
01:06:10,739 --> 01:06:14,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Yugekitai Katsugekihen, which was K.O.

966
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Flying Squadron 2, which was on Saturn.

967
01:06:16,483 --> 01:06:16,984
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the game.

968
01:06:17,164 --> 01:06:18,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually own that one.

969
01:06:19,165 --> 01:06:20,566
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also K.O.

970
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:21,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Yugekitai Okira...

971
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:26,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Tamatai Bako, which is like a demo CD.

972
01:06:27,194 --> 01:06:37,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there was Rami-chan no Oedo's Sugoroku Keiou Gekisai Gaiden, which was like a special bonus story for Rami, who is the little girl in the game.

973
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:37,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

974
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:39,849
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a little shooting game.

975
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:47,953
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a cutesy little shooting game where, like I said, she rides on the back of the dragon and she has a large mallet for hitting enemies.

976
01:06:48,453 --> 01:06:53,496
[SPEAKER_11]: She has an umbrella for hitting enemies and a bow so she can shoot arrows at enemies.

977
01:06:54,016 --> 01:06:57,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Rami can bounce on enemies' heads and kill them that way.

978
01:06:57,898 --> 01:07:03,260
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also shoot at them and you get little bonus buddies to help you.

979
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's like your options.

980
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:05,682
[SPEAKER_11]: That was in Chaos Flag Squadron 2.

981
01:07:08,185 --> 01:07:14,956
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one had, it was basically just a few less options with that since it was very limited.

982
01:07:15,296 --> 01:07:17,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And all this audio in it, of course, was Redbook audio.

983
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:19,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Are those pigs that look like people?

984
01:07:19,884 --> 01:07:20,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

985
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:20,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

986
01:07:22,399 --> 01:07:25,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so they're very fun little games.

987
01:07:26,302 --> 01:07:40,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, there's also, um, in, uh, KO Flying Squadron 2, there's another character called Himiko, um, who made, like, a, uh, a robot called the Psy V, and she was, like, KO's, uh, rival.

988
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:41,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not KO, why did I say KO?

989
01:07:41,972 --> 01:07:42,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Rami's rival.

990
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:48,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then there were, there was, uh, an intelligent raccoon who was their enemy, who was a member of Greenpeace.

991
01:07:51,098 --> 01:07:53,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's from Mexico.

992
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,321
[SPEAKER_11]: A raccoon from Mexico.

993
01:07:56,381 --> 01:07:57,681
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a member of Greenpeace.

994
01:07:58,622 --> 01:08:01,063
[SPEAKER_11]: He's the bad guy.

995
01:08:01,083 --> 01:08:03,944
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's... This looks kind of cute.

996
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:05,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of this game in my life.

997
01:08:05,905 --> 01:08:06,545
[SPEAKER_11]: It's cracked out cute.

998
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:10,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I didn't really follow the whole Sega empire until years later.

999
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:11,508
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is cute.

1000
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:12,974
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1001
01:08:38,717 --> 01:08:39,457
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

1002
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:12,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say live from BlizzCon, but that can't happen because BlizzCon is now over.

1003
01:09:12,786 --> 01:09:14,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So, not live from BlizzCon.

1004
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:19,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1005
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:39,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you see the debate this week?

1006
01:09:39,245 --> 01:09:41,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, Tom Brokaw was the man, okay?

1007
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:42,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Brokaw was very fierce.

1008
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:44,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, he ruled the debate.

1009
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,031
[SPEAKER_11]: He ruled the entire debate.

1010
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:46,152
[SPEAKER_09]: He won the debate, actually.

1011
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:46,713
[SPEAKER_09]: He did.

1012
01:09:46,773 --> 01:09:47,433
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion.

1013
01:09:47,453 --> 01:09:48,454
[SPEAKER_11]: He's gonna be the next president.

1014
01:09:48,474 --> 01:09:50,476
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, do you see those fucking lights on the ground?

1015
01:09:51,197 --> 01:09:53,319
[SPEAKER_09]: When they get red, STFU!

1016
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,001
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I never... Bukkake!

1017
01:09:58,924 --> 01:09:59,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1018
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:02,003
[SPEAKER_09]: We got some gaming news to get back into.

1019
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:03,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1020
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you enjoyed that music break for those of you guys listening live.

1021
01:10:06,147 --> 01:10:07,609
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not listening live, why not?

1022
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:09,911
[SPEAKER_09]: You should join us on Sunday nights live.

1023
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:14,736
[SPEAKER_09]: You can even listen to us on the go thanks to the OLR PSP website that has the all games radio player.

1024
01:10:15,017 --> 01:10:17,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I think some folks are listening to us on iPhones as well.

1025
01:10:17,219 --> 01:10:19,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's some application you can use to do that.

1026
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:20,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Some type of tuning program.

1027
01:10:21,703 --> 01:10:22,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So, pretty awesome.

1028
01:10:23,664 --> 01:10:25,205
[SPEAKER_09]: But we got some more gaming news to cover.

1029
01:10:25,426 --> 01:10:27,247
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a BlizzCon report to get to.

1030
01:10:27,787 --> 01:10:32,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, first off though, since we've been talking about conventions, I want to start this segment off before we get to the actual gaming news.

1031
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:42,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Reading responses to our Twitter question, the pre-OLR twit, for those of us following, for those of you guys following us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR, we asked the question tonight...

1032
01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:44,119
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1033
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:05,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1034
01:11:05,369 --> 01:11:08,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Javier Altman says, Yes, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show.

1035
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:08,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1036
01:11:08,953 --> 01:11:11,816
[SPEAKER_09]: To get into the panties of as many booth babes as humanly possible.

1037
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:12,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Them love Latin cock.

1038
01:11:13,077 --> 01:11:13,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1039
01:11:14,038 --> 01:11:15,440
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a nice G-Radio response.

1040
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,122
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkTetsuya says, Hell, yes.

1041
01:11:17,242 --> 01:11:21,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always wanted to go to Japan anyway, but an event like TGS with all the newest Japanese games do want...

1042
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:26,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Marin Marvel says, heck yes, I could go if I could.

1043
01:11:26,707 --> 01:11:29,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Squeenix and Konami are bound to unveil some awesome things at Tokyo Game Show.

1044
01:11:29,789 --> 01:11:30,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, you know it's Tokyo.

1045
01:11:31,671 --> 01:11:34,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, yes, it's basically E3, but done way better.

1046
01:11:34,713 --> 01:11:36,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's basically all the great announcements we hear.

1047
01:11:36,775 --> 01:11:37,975
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to hear them firsthand.

1048
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:42,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Jacksonman says, I'm from Kentucky, so going anywhere but here would be nice.

1049
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Crows says, of course I want to go.

1050
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:48,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Japanese games almost always have more.

1051
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:51,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go and learn which upcoming games have little anime girls.

1052
01:11:52,732 --> 01:11:55,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Geovidea says, oh hell yes, it's Japan.

1053
01:11:55,456 --> 01:11:57,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been trying to get there for a few years now.

1054
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,681
[SPEAKER_09]: MistyOLR says, admittedly, not really.

1055
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:03,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I have ASEN and I can actually afford that con compared to going all the way to Japan.

1056
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:06,310
[SPEAKER_09]: A nice realistic answer from Misty.

1057
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Joosten says, nah, it's all about packs.

1058
01:12:09,774 --> 01:12:11,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I did E3 a few times when it was good.

1059
01:12:11,655 --> 01:12:14,056
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough OMG game show spectacle for me.

1060
01:12:14,516 --> 01:12:16,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So surprisingly, a couple people saying no.

1061
01:12:16,476 --> 01:12:20,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have assumed that it would have been right 100% yeses across the board.

1062
01:12:20,798 --> 01:12:22,399
[SPEAKER_09]: So surprises abound on our Twitter.

1063
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:23,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the responses, folks.

1064
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:27,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the whole reason that I would really want to go is to go hang out with my friends that live over there.

1065
01:12:29,981 --> 01:12:32,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just to go somewhere else.

1066
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:34,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never been to Japan.

1067
01:12:34,023 --> 01:12:34,523
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be fun.

1068
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:42,559
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because really after having been to E3 all those years it really is a big spectacle that type of thing, don't you think?

1069
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:44,664
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something about being there.

1070
01:12:44,684 --> 01:12:45,704
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like magic in the air.

1071
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:46,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1072
01:12:46,245 --> 01:12:47,385
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes you more excited about everything.

1073
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,406
[SPEAKER_11]: More like unwashed fanboys in the air over here.

1074
01:12:49,526 --> 01:12:50,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shush.

1075
01:12:50,887 --> 01:12:54,229
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get back into some gaming news now that we've heard from you Twitter folks tonight.

1076
01:12:54,589 --> 01:12:54,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1077
01:12:55,249 --> 01:12:55,570
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1078
01:12:56,030 --> 01:13:09,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is sort of a rumor right now, but apparently the website tinycartridge.com is reporting that they have found a trademark registered in Japan for...

1079
01:13:10,078 --> 01:13:11,839
[SPEAKER_07]: What is called DS Scan.

1080
01:13:12,219 --> 01:13:21,508
[SPEAKER_07]: And what they theorize it is, is it's something that's going to be used with the DSi's camera to unlock DS content.

1081
01:13:21,748 --> 01:13:27,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, one of the things that they're also speculating is that it's for use with QR codes.

1082
01:13:28,214 --> 01:13:33,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Which those who do not know, QR codes are those square, kind of pixely looking...

1083
01:13:33,979 --> 01:13:34,800
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1084
01:13:52,089 --> 01:14:02,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Reveal more information like some examples are nutritional information on food, directions on Google Maps, contact details, business cards, etc.

1085
01:14:02,914 --> 01:14:06,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Or even links to different game developer sites and stuff like that.

1086
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:10,878
[SPEAKER_07]: So that would be a pretty cool feature, especially since the DSi is going to have a built-in web browser.

1087
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:13,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I could see something like that actually being implemented.

1088
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, it's all speculation to see how that's going to work.

1089
01:14:20,094 --> 01:14:20,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1090
01:14:20,694 --> 01:14:22,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting comments from the chat room.

1091
01:14:22,775 --> 01:14:26,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee in chat, chat.org.com says, DSI e-reader.

1092
01:14:26,737 --> 01:14:29,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And Unfolded Raptor says, sad thing, I actually bought an e-reader.

1093
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,639
[SPEAKER_09]: What a waste of money.

1094
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:34,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, I have some Animal Crossing e-reader cards.

1095
01:14:34,461 --> 01:14:35,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to the e-reader?

1096
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's one of those peripherals that they didn't really support that much.

1097
01:14:38,963 --> 01:14:40,444
[SPEAKER_07]: But could this be something like that?

1098
01:14:40,464 --> 01:14:41,585
[SPEAKER_07]: This could be something like that.

1099
01:14:41,705 --> 01:14:43,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, they could release cards.

1100
01:14:43,586 --> 01:14:45,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think it would be kind of cool...

1101
01:14:47,775 --> 01:15:04,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Before, remember, they were talking about doing something with the DS version of Viva Pinata, where they were going to have images that appear on the DS, and you can scan them with your Xbox 360 camera and import your characters into that.

1102
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:06,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now you can do it vice versa that way.

1103
01:15:06,321 --> 01:15:09,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, but I'm getting total value for my Xbox 360 camera right now.

1104
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:11,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, did you see camera mode in Beat and Groovy?

1105
01:15:11,963 --> 01:15:12,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Wahoo!

1106
01:15:13,503 --> 01:15:14,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1107
01:15:14,104 --> 01:15:14,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed that.

1108
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,281
[SPEAKER_07]: What was camera mode in Beat and Groovy?

1109
01:15:17,761 --> 01:15:19,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you hit balloons.

1110
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:20,944
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... Lame.

1111
01:15:20,964 --> 01:15:21,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1112
01:15:21,324 --> 01:15:22,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Tacked on junk.

1113
01:15:22,545 --> 01:15:30,010
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, sadly enough, I'm going to be coming into contact with another camera because I'm buying that game, You're in the Movies.

1114
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:31,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1115
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:32,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it looks fun.

1116
01:15:33,011 --> 01:15:34,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a fun party game.

1117
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:34,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1118
01:15:35,593 --> 01:15:39,516
[SPEAKER_07]: And it unfortunately comes with another camera, so now I have two useless cameras.

1119
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:41,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations?

1120
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:42,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1121
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:42,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1122
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:48,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how about some other Nintendo news that you can really get excited about coming out of Tokyo Game Show?

1123
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:52,219
[SPEAKER_09]: No More Heroes 2 is coming out.

1124
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, here's the thing, though.

1125
01:15:55,382 --> 01:15:58,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it wasn't really necessarily confirmed for the Nintendo Wii.

1126
01:15:58,986 --> 01:15:59,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's for the Wii.

1127
01:15:59,707 --> 01:16:00,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

1128
01:16:00,307 --> 01:16:01,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

1129
01:16:01,268 --> 01:16:03,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I remember when they saw the trailer, it didn't say Wii anywhere in it.

1130
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:06,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So some people were actually speculating a little bit.

1131
01:16:06,352 --> 01:16:08,674
[SPEAKER_09]: But all right, it sounds like it was confirmed for the Wii, which makes sense.

1132
01:16:08,934 --> 01:16:09,495
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it makes sense.

1133
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:13,378
[SPEAKER_09]: No More Heroes Desperate Struggle is the name of the game.

1134
01:16:13,658 --> 01:16:17,400
[SPEAKER_09]: See, people thought it might have been for the DS because, you know, Desperate Struggle, DS.

1135
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:19,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good thought, yeah.

1136
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay, yeah, that makes sense.

1137
01:16:21,023 --> 01:16:24,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, there's folks wishful thinking it would be on 360 or PlayStation 3.

1138
01:16:24,926 --> 01:16:25,566
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it were.

1139
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:26,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another...

1140
01:16:27,848 --> 01:16:28,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another Wii game.

1141
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:31,253
[SPEAKER_09]: You played a lot of the first No More Heroes game, Loki.

1142
01:16:31,273 --> 01:16:31,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you excited?

1143
01:16:32,595 --> 01:16:33,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I am excited.

1144
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:34,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it looks awesome.

1145
01:16:34,357 --> 01:16:36,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wish, though, it was on the 360.

1146
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:39,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it'd be even more awesome.

1147
01:16:39,665 --> 01:16:40,346
[SPEAKER_07]: More awesomer?

1148
01:16:41,269 --> 01:16:49,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, actually, you know, I wish a lot of the games that they're putting on the Wii were on, like, the 360 or PS3, like No More Heroes, Mad World.

1149
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:54,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's what's strange, and, you know, again, here's a story that didn't really make show world tonight.

1150
01:16:54,093 --> 01:17:00,495
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just been a busy week, but there's rumors going around about the Wii HD again, and the successor to Nintendo Wii is coming out in 2011.

1151
01:17:01,095 --> 01:17:03,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why this rumor has suddenly caught more steam.

1152
01:17:04,336 --> 01:17:07,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know who I was looking at was being sourced for the rumor?

1153
01:17:08,137 --> 01:17:09,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Get this, whattheyplay.com.

1154
01:17:10,498 --> 01:17:11,559
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1155
01:17:35,952 --> 01:17:38,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, of course there's going to be a follow-up to the Wii system.

1156
01:17:38,133 --> 01:17:40,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the thing has sold millions and jillions.

1157
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:41,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course there's going to be a follow-up.

1158
01:17:41,736 --> 01:17:42,677
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a question of when.

1159
01:17:42,737 --> 01:17:46,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So people like to pull dates out of their fucking butts as to when it's coming.

1160
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:51,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if they're off, they'll just say, oh, it just got delayed.

1161
01:17:52,405 --> 01:17:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, oh, they're putting it out early.

1162
01:17:53,605 --> 01:17:55,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a bunch of crap.

1163
01:17:55,807 --> 01:17:57,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course there's going to be a Wii follow-up.

1164
01:17:57,308 --> 01:17:57,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is this news?

1165
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:01,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw it, like, on the front page of Yahoo as the successor to the Wii.

1166
01:18:02,492 --> 01:18:02,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

1167
01:18:04,554 --> 01:18:05,395
[SPEAKER_11]: When was that new?

1168
01:18:06,075 --> 01:18:06,795
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, for real.

1169
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:07,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry.

1170
01:18:07,456 --> 01:18:10,418
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, when is Yahoo known for reporting game news?

1171
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:13,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I use their mail service, so I see the stuff on the page of their site.

1172
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,401
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I completely understand.

1173
01:18:17,122 --> 01:18:18,583
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little weird to me, that's all.

1174
01:18:19,723 --> 01:18:28,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially since they're trying to sell some new video gaming news thing, and if that's your cutting edge story, I weep for the future.

1175
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:29,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1176
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,731
[SPEAKER_11]: I weep all the time anyway.

1177
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1178
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:37,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Nintendo Points are not going to transfer between the Wii and the DSi.

1179
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:40,349
[SPEAKER_11]: It is official.

1180
01:18:41,429 --> 01:18:42,669
[SPEAKER_11]: They have their own points.

1181
01:18:43,929 --> 01:18:44,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And let me guess.

1182
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:55,132
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be one of those things where I have to buy $10 or $20 worth of points at a time, and then the games will cost just enough so that I have like $300 left over at any given time.

1183
01:18:55,692 --> 01:18:56,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct?

1184
01:18:56,912 --> 01:18:57,412
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

1185
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:24,533
[SPEAKER_07]: well basically that that pretty much is yeah but they have to be separate yeah it's totally impossible for a service to do that it's not like you know companies like Microsoft have I don't know Microsoft points that you can use on both Xbox marketplace or I don't know the Zune marketplace it's totally impossible that technology does not exist more like they just don't want to

1186
01:19:25,097 --> 01:19:25,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1187
01:19:43,124 --> 01:19:48,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Redertainment says in chat, it's like selling six hot dogs to a pack by eight buns to a pack.

1188
01:19:48,566 --> 01:19:48,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1189
01:19:48,726 --> 01:19:49,667
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a perfect analogy.

1190
01:19:50,307 --> 01:19:52,848
[SPEAKER_09]: AlphaCatanogram says it's all Nintendo points now.

1191
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:53,528
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I thought.

1192
01:19:53,608 --> 01:19:54,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was going to be all Nintendo points.

1193
01:19:54,648 --> 01:20:03,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It is all Nintendo points now, but now, you know, once you put those Nintendo points in, like, you know, one place and you can't really do anything with them.

1194
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:04,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can't name.

1195
01:20:04,772 --> 01:20:08,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have two different accounts because, once again, there's no unified online service.

1196
01:20:08,954 --> 01:20:09,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Grr.

1197
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:19,132
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised they don't have, you know, like, a friend code for the points or something like that that you gotta put in, you know, make sure that you can buy that game or something.

1198
01:20:19,172 --> 01:20:22,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Or that you have to write with your stylus, all praise Nintendo.

1199
01:20:22,873 --> 01:20:24,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Glory, glory, hallelujah.

1200
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:26,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, I do wish to purchase said game.

1201
01:20:28,354 --> 01:20:28,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Blue?

1202
01:20:28,694 --> 01:20:34,876
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the DSi will actually have a place that will prick your finger for blood every time you actually want to get points.

1203
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:36,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's how you pay for the games.

1204
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,520
[SPEAKER_06]: With your blood.

1205
01:20:37,561 --> 01:20:38,581
[SPEAKER_06]: With your soul.

1206
01:20:40,563 --> 01:20:44,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, do you wish to purchase this game and relinquish your soul?

1207
01:20:45,066 --> 01:20:45,326
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1208
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:48,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I just sold my soul for a donut.

1209
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:52,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Red Entertainment, that's perfect.

1210
01:20:52,331 --> 01:20:53,331
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to write every time.

1211
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:54,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a Nintendo lemming.

1212
01:20:55,353 --> 01:20:56,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Bah, bah, bah.

1213
01:20:57,114 --> 01:20:57,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow.

1214
01:20:58,695 --> 01:21:01,477
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what segment of ours has to follow a story like this.

1215
01:21:12,967 --> 01:21:16,788
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for the FUs of the week.

1216
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:25,552
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU of the week goes towards... You know what?

1217
01:21:25,632 --> 01:21:27,072
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that I have one for once.

1218
01:21:27,873 --> 01:21:28,293
[SPEAKER_11]: Gasp.

1219
01:21:29,313 --> 01:21:31,234
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to your lack of angst?

1220
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:32,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no.

1221
01:21:32,294 --> 01:21:34,055
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because I'm a Vicodin.

1222
01:21:35,376 --> 01:21:38,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And Vicodin makes you not give a shit about anything.

1223
01:21:38,677 --> 01:21:38,997
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah.

1224
01:21:39,277 --> 01:21:39,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I've got one.

1225
01:21:40,718 --> 01:21:41,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Moron.

1226
01:21:43,434 --> 01:21:54,545
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to people, anyone who thinks I'm insulted by anything anyone has to say about me because that's obviously a sign that someone else has the issue and I do not.

1227
01:21:56,106 --> 01:21:57,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't come in my cubicle!

1228
01:21:58,928 --> 01:21:59,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1229
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:39,135
[SPEAKER_11]: and he just started mumbling and just trying to say you know just really stupid insulting things and I got you know what I did I laughed I just laughed I laughed so hard right there I was like dude you know how stupid you sound and so he left and didn't bother me the rest of the day

1230
01:22:39,861 --> 01:22:41,162
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just what I'm going to do from now on.

1231
01:22:41,202 --> 01:22:47,248
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone ever tries to just, you know, be mean, I'm just going to laugh.

1232
01:22:47,468 --> 01:22:47,849
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1233
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:50,711
[SPEAKER_11]: My response from now on is going to be, uh-huh.

1234
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:51,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this.

1235
01:22:51,712 --> 01:22:53,954
[SPEAKER_09]: The Rob D in chat says, I've seen her cubicle.

1236
01:22:54,295 --> 01:22:59,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Much like you would expect from DarkSakura, it's filled with pink fluffy clouds and is generally welcoming.

1237
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,440
[SPEAKER_11]: The hell it is!

1238
01:23:02,614 --> 01:23:20,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I killed him with laughter, because I mean, basically, okay, keep in mind, I've had this problem before, and the whole reason that I think that people try to be insulting, especially when they're in the wrong, is to make themselves feel less wrong, to put themselves in a position of superiority.

1239
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:27,872
[SPEAKER_11]: And this person has absolutely zero room, and I can say that in a completely unbiased fashion.

1240
01:23:28,472 --> 01:23:30,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do have the giant Tekken poster in my cubicle, thank you.

1241
01:23:31,494 --> 01:23:32,135
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you'd say?

1242
01:23:32,737 --> 01:23:34,118
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was answering that comment.

1243
01:23:35,058 --> 01:23:37,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I just laughed.

1244
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:38,660
[SPEAKER_11]: I just laughed.

1245
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:48,604
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, how can someone say that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about when this is the same person that asks me how to copy cells in Excel?

1246
01:23:50,114 --> 01:23:50,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't ask!

1247
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:51,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Control-C, Control-V.

1248
01:23:52,376 --> 01:23:52,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly!

1249
01:23:53,116 --> 01:23:56,779
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says, you need to set up gun turrets at the entrance of your cubicle.

1250
01:23:57,139 --> 01:24:02,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I was looking at ThinkGeek just a moment ago, and they do have USB missile launchers.

1251
01:24:02,443 --> 01:24:03,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are overrated.

1252
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:05,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me, I have one at my desk.

1253
01:24:05,085 --> 01:24:05,866
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just retarded.

1254
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:07,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It sits there for seconds, all like...

1255
01:24:09,361 --> 01:24:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I could build a better rocket launcher.

1256
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:13,702
[SPEAKER_07]: My cubicle drains the souls of other people and then gives them to me.

1257
01:24:13,722 --> 01:24:14,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Loki.

1258
01:24:37,392 --> 01:24:43,135
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to myself for buying a magazine for my gun that's a double mag.

1259
01:24:43,155 --> 01:24:52,799
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is because it's basically two magazines that are stuck next to each other when I plug it in, the other magazine covers the switch that allows me to pop the magazine out.

1260
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:58,021
[SPEAKER_07]: So it makes it near impossible to take out the magazine once I put it in.

1261
01:24:59,401 --> 01:24:59,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Dope!

1262
01:25:00,782 --> 01:25:01,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Should have paid attention.

1263
01:25:01,882 --> 01:25:03,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I still love it though.

1264
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:07,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that it?

1265
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:11,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Also an FU to my Triton headphones I've got.

1266
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:17,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Already the left side, basically if you jiggle the cord a little bit, it will go out.

1267
01:25:17,509 --> 01:25:19,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So that pisses me off because they were expensive.

1268
01:25:21,078 --> 01:25:21,158
[SPEAKER_09]: F.U.

1269
01:25:21,178 --> 01:25:27,484
[SPEAKER_09]: to the pig fucker who stole the political sign from my front yard earlier this week, not even 24 hours after I placed it up.

1270
01:25:27,585 --> 01:25:31,809
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we have a very controversial proposition in the ballot here in California.

1271
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:38,896
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to ban same-sex marriage and take rights away from people and treat certain people of this country differently than others, or of the state, I should say.

1272
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:39,897
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a state proposition.

1273
01:25:40,437 --> 01:25:41,397
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's called Proposition 8.

1274
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:44,078
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using scare tactics to do it, which aren't even true.

1275
01:25:44,638 --> 01:25:46,339
[SPEAKER_09]: They are not going to tax churches.

1276
01:25:46,959 --> 01:25:49,560
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to force churches to marry people they don't want to marry.

1277
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:51,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Do atheists get married in church right now?

1278
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they force churches to marry people?

1279
01:25:53,801 --> 01:25:56,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Can a non-Catholic get married in mass?

1280
01:25:56,262 --> 01:25:56,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

1281
01:25:56,882 --> 01:25:57,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1282
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:06,505
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't... I mean, when we were getting married and trying to have a Jewish wedding, you know, the female... What was it?

1283
01:26:06,545 --> 01:26:07,185
[SPEAKER_07]: The female...

1284
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:10,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Not priest, what's the word I'm looking for here?

1285
01:26:11,012 --> 01:26:11,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Rabbi.

1286
01:26:11,612 --> 01:26:11,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Rabbi.

1287
01:26:12,053 --> 01:26:13,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, a female rabbi.

1288
01:26:13,354 --> 01:26:18,339
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, no, I don't want to marry a non-Jew and a Jew together.

1289
01:26:18,359 --> 01:26:20,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, you're a fucking female rabbi.

1290
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,264
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not supposed to be female rabbis, idiot.

1291
01:26:22,604 --> 01:26:23,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking contradictive.

1292
01:26:24,006 --> 01:26:25,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, look, I don't...

1293
01:26:25,567 --> 01:26:26,608
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1294
01:26:46,007 --> 01:26:49,468
[SPEAKER_09]: That our grandparents fought for, but I guess history repeats itself, so what the fuck ever.

1295
01:26:49,848 --> 01:26:56,771
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyhow, obviously, for obvious reasons, a very staunch supporter of the No on 8 campaign.

1296
01:26:57,251 --> 01:27:01,832
[SPEAKER_09]: So I had a No on 8 sign in the front yard of my house, and it got stolen within 24 hours.

1297
01:27:01,912 --> 01:27:06,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's just the kind of idiocy that's behind the support of this proposition.

1298
01:27:06,674 --> 01:27:10,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolute moronism behind Proposition 8.

1299
01:27:11,676 --> 01:27:15,417
[SPEAKER_09]: That would steal a yard sign from the front of my house to make a goddamn point.

1300
01:27:16,670 --> 01:27:18,351
[SPEAKER_09]: The point you made was that you're an idiot.

1301
01:27:18,391 --> 01:27:18,872
[SPEAKER_09]: End of story.

1302
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:19,833
[SPEAKER_09]: So guess what?

1303
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:22,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a second sign waiting in the house and I promptly put it up in its place.

1304
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:26,301
[SPEAKER_11]: You should electrify it, Rob.

1305
01:27:26,401 --> 01:27:28,822
[SPEAKER_09]: The good idea was to rub it down to something sticky.

1306
01:27:29,242 --> 01:27:34,603
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Sauce pointed out to me, for me to inform Loki, is that female rabbis are allowed in Reformed Judaism.

1307
01:27:34,923 --> 01:27:41,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, it depends what branch of the... They're allowed, I understand that, but the problem is, like, originally they're not... That's why it's Reformed.

1308
01:27:42,566 --> 01:27:42,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1309
01:27:44,286 --> 01:27:49,868
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's okay to also marry, you know, out of the religion, but it's just... They're just being stupid.

1310
01:27:49,888 --> 01:27:50,628
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, oh...

1311
01:27:51,636 --> 01:27:53,576
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is okay, but it's not okay.

1312
01:27:54,017 --> 01:28:08,860
[SPEAKER_11]: What pisses me off, and I have to add to Rob's FU, is just, um, like, uh, the, uh, I haven't seen the commercials, but I've heard of them, and I've been told of the concepts, and I don't watch TV, of, you know, them saying all that bullshit.

1313
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:13,681
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, they're trying to appeal to the stupid, pretty much, to the uninformed, to the ignorant.

1314
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:17,262
[SPEAKER_09]: They're trying to scare people that we're gonna have to teach it in schools.

1315
01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:20,301
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1316
01:28:37,566 --> 01:28:38,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1317
01:29:05,625 --> 01:29:08,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Your email address is... I don't care.

1318
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:09,347
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do it.

1319
01:29:09,527 --> 01:29:10,167
[SPEAKER_09]: It just bugs me.

1320
01:29:10,508 --> 01:29:10,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1321
01:29:11,148 --> 01:29:11,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1322
01:29:12,368 --> 01:29:12,909
[SPEAKER_09]: This is war.

1323
01:29:13,809 --> 01:29:15,610
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, this is what I have to say, actually, Rob.

1324
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, go ahead.

1325
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:19,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even though they're wrong.

1326
01:29:19,692 --> 01:29:20,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But not on this.

1327
01:29:20,512 --> 01:29:21,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1328
01:29:21,633 --> 01:29:23,934
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we have to be fair.

1329
01:29:24,334 --> 01:29:25,015
[SPEAKER_11]: This is America.

1330
01:29:27,596 --> 01:29:31,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand, but at the same time, your rights stop where mine begin.

1331
01:29:32,637 --> 01:29:33,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree.

1332
01:29:34,278 --> 01:29:38,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, this was my second point, is that yes, you're allowed to disagree.

1333
01:29:38,162 --> 01:29:39,403
[SPEAKER_11]: You're allowed to have your belief.

1334
01:29:39,723 --> 01:29:48,750
[SPEAKER_11]: That is what this country was founded on, not God or religion, because Thomas Jefferson certainly didn't follow that, and he wrote our Declaration of Independence.

1335
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:49,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

1336
01:29:50,272 --> 01:29:57,917
[SPEAKER_11]: My point is that everyone should be allowed to believe and feel what they want to believe and feel.

1337
01:29:58,697 --> 01:30:03,641
[SPEAKER_11]: They just have to also be equally tolerant of anyone who believes other than what they do.

1338
01:30:03,701 --> 01:30:05,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I tell everybody, be offended.

1339
01:30:05,862 --> 01:30:06,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Learn to be offended.

1340
01:30:07,043 --> 01:30:08,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having a hard time, Jamie.

1341
01:30:09,845 --> 01:30:14,208
[SPEAKER_11]: See, this is the problem is that we're dealing with people who aren't leaving it at that.

1342
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:23,140
[SPEAKER_11]: We're dealing with people who are trying to force their point of view on other people and have the majority view right now.

1343
01:30:25,257 --> 01:30:27,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're getting too much on the political topic.

1344
01:30:30,339 --> 01:30:36,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I firmly believe that we should be a more tolerant people.

1345
01:30:36,521 --> 01:30:42,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously it's a very sensitive issue that I have a very strong and invested opinion in for obvious reasons.

1346
01:30:42,543 --> 01:30:46,785
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I'm a little bit unhinged, I apologize to a point.

1347
01:30:46,985 --> 01:30:53,527
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly you need to understand that when you are voting yes on this, you are saying my rights are not...

1348
01:30:54,227 --> 01:30:57,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and that's why I get so fucking incensed.

1349
01:31:01,193 --> 01:31:01,753
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1350
01:31:02,414 --> 01:31:02,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1351
01:31:04,636 --> 01:31:06,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, let's get back to the gaming news, shall we?

1352
01:31:06,437 --> 01:31:09,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, video games to make everything better and make us forget about what a fucked up world we live in.

1353
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

1354
01:31:10,981 --> 01:31:11,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1355
01:31:12,262 --> 01:31:12,643
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact...

1356
01:31:13,493 --> 01:31:14,654
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1357
01:31:33,124 --> 01:31:40,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, instead of a brand new game, they're going to have a compilation of all the Nintendo 64 and GameCube titles on one disc.

1358
01:31:41,372 --> 01:31:44,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be like one of those Play on the Wii things.

1359
01:31:45,756 --> 01:31:45,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1360
01:31:46,436 --> 01:31:47,097
[SPEAKER_07]: They were not bad.

1361
01:31:47,257 --> 01:31:48,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Those games are pretty good.

1362
01:31:48,678 --> 01:31:50,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that'd be kind of cool.

1363
01:31:50,885 --> 01:31:55,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But where is my lightsaber-wielding game?

1364
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:58,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Force Unleashed, the Clone Wars lightsaber duels.

1365
01:31:58,667 --> 01:32:00,708
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I mean like with the Wiimote and that whole thing.

1366
01:32:00,728 --> 01:32:02,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess there was the lightsaber duels thing.

1367
01:32:02,028 --> 01:32:03,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Sports Resort.

1368
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:04,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes, I forgot.

1369
01:32:04,909 --> 01:32:05,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Sports Resort.

1370
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:05,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1371
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:06,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me put it this way.

1372
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:10,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't want to see one until the Wii Motion Plus came out anyways.

1373
01:32:11,431 --> 01:32:15,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And even one that came out, I mean, they could port the arcade game.

1374
01:32:15,832 --> 01:32:16,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the arcade game?

1375
01:32:18,796 --> 01:32:19,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the arcade game.

1376
01:32:19,798 --> 01:32:20,479
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fun.

1377
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:26,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so GS68 said just like almost at the exact same time in chat, Star Wars Trilogy Arcade Games bonus rounds.

1378
01:32:27,202 --> 01:32:27,542
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1379
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:53,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Video games have really taken over on YouTube.

1380
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:59,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, heck, all these classic games of the week that DarkSakura's reporting on, you can search for any of them on YouTube and look at clips of the game.

1381
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:04,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's new game reviews and there's tons and tons of video game content out on YouTube.

1382
01:33:04,757 --> 01:33:07,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Well now, what YouTube has decided they want to do

1383
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:08,301
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1384
01:33:26,014 --> 01:33:30,258
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to start with some of the music based on EMI Music and Universal.

1385
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's also going to be video games made by EA.

1386
01:33:33,602 --> 01:33:39,007
[SPEAKER_09]: So apparently when you go, let's say you visit a YouTube of a game made from EA, you'll be able to buy the game right there.

1387
01:33:40,168 --> 01:33:40,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1388
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:41,750
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of neat.

1389
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:43,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And then YouTube will get a cut of the game sales.

1390
01:33:44,152 --> 01:33:46,214
[SPEAKER_09]: So YouTube will sell you games.

1391
01:33:46,594 --> 01:33:46,975
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1392
01:33:48,677 --> 01:33:49,397
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good tie-in.

1393
01:33:49,437 --> 01:33:50,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, kind of a duh.

1394
01:33:50,538 --> 01:33:52,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of surprised it didn't really happen before.

1395
01:33:53,438 --> 01:33:56,119
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm curious, you know, what about the retro games?

1396
01:33:56,439 --> 01:33:57,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are a little harder to find.

1397
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe eBay links or something.

1398
01:33:59,620 --> 01:33:59,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knows?

1399
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Or links to used game stores.

1400
01:34:03,361 --> 01:34:03,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

1401
01:34:05,822 --> 01:34:06,362
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1402
01:34:07,743 --> 01:34:08,183
[SPEAKER_09]: YouTube.

1403
01:34:09,663 --> 01:34:13,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if soon you'll be able to buy DVDs of TV shows that you see on YouTube.

1404
01:34:13,244 --> 01:34:16,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like, you know, like... CD for Chocolate Rain.

1405
01:34:17,006 --> 01:34:17,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I hardly ever...

1406
01:34:19,025 --> 01:34:19,525
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1407
01:34:46,454 --> 01:34:46,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1408
01:34:46,894 --> 01:34:50,155
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew you'd be on Vicodin tonight, so you just want to be happy, happy.

1409
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,716
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd rather give me... Because you know if I don't care about something, I'll say I don't care about it.

1410
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:55,917
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very, very, very happy news.

1411
01:34:56,737 --> 01:35:02,659
[SPEAKER_11]: For Street Fighter 4 home releases, there's been another female character confirmed.

1412
01:35:02,699 --> 01:35:03,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's Sakura!

1413
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:04,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very happy!

1414
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:29,311
[SPEAKER_11]: and I watched video of it actually today Rob and she's there in her full kick-ass glory so I'm quite thrilled with that but she was confirmed actually to Famitsu by Yoshinori Ono that she was going to definitely be in the home version and there's also going to be a few more things in the home version including a training mode

1415
01:35:30,703 --> 01:35:31,023
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1416
01:35:46,109 --> 01:35:50,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter I actually adopted her as my online avatar for a while.

1417
01:35:51,893 --> 01:35:52,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I remember that.

1418
01:35:53,574 --> 01:35:59,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Way back in the day on the Sacramento's DDR forum, your little avatar was DarkSakura, the actual one.

1419
01:35:59,778 --> 01:36:11,665
[SPEAKER_11]: I had taken the picture from the ending of Rival Schools and did the sunburnt look to her and made her sailor dress black and make her red eyes.

1420
01:36:12,746 --> 01:36:14,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Early photoshopping before I had photoshopped.

1421
01:36:14,867 --> 01:36:16,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we're all going to be playing Street Fighter 4.

1422
01:36:16,787 --> 01:36:18,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited about that game.

1423
01:36:18,568 --> 01:36:19,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it was out by Christmas.

1424
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:21,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish it was out by right now.

1425
01:36:21,888 --> 01:36:26,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I also kind of don't because I need my games to be spaced out right about now because I'm still trying to work on Silent Hill Homecoming.

1426
01:36:27,309 --> 01:36:30,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I've got World of Warcraft going on, which, by the way, I deemed 50 on my alt.

1427
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1428
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:39,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I will have you know, though, that Street Fighter 4 is supposed to be coming out around the time as the brand new Street Fighter movie.

1429
01:36:39,672 --> 01:36:40,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

1430
01:36:40,072 --> 01:36:42,252
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll give you a nice fresh taste in your mouth.

1431
01:36:44,176 --> 01:36:45,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, anyways.

1432
01:36:45,997 --> 01:36:46,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Hero.

1433
01:36:47,498 --> 01:36:50,260
[SPEAKER_07]: World Tour is right around the corner, only a few weeks away.

1434
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:55,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that is going to be some brand new download content available for the game.

1435
01:36:56,964 --> 01:37:08,930
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have a classic rock track pack filled with a bunch of different things, including Rock and Roll Band by Boston, Hot Blooded by Foreigner, and Jessie's Girl by Rick Springfield.

1436
01:37:09,211 --> 01:37:09,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome!

1437
01:37:11,668 --> 01:37:14,931
[SPEAKER_07]: and then also they're going to have a few more tracks.

1438
01:37:15,972 --> 01:37:17,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Blind Melons, No Rain.

1439
01:37:17,694 --> 01:37:19,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh dear god, I hate that song.

1440
01:37:20,076 --> 01:37:20,236
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1441
01:37:20,296 --> 01:37:21,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that song.

1442
01:37:21,257 --> 01:37:24,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is in Rock Band 2 right now.

1443
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:28,264
[SPEAKER_09]: No wait, Blind Melons isn't in Rock Band 2, are they?

1444
01:37:28,925 --> 01:37:29,025
[SPEAKER_07]: R.E.M.

1445
01:37:29,045 --> 01:37:30,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Horse to Water, Man Size Wreath, Supernatural, Super Serious

1446
01:37:54,767 --> 01:37:56,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Supernatural, Super Serious?

1447
01:37:57,569 --> 01:37:59,150
[SPEAKER_11]: God, they never put in the one R.E.M.

1448
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,330
[SPEAKER_11]: song I'd like to have in there.

1449
01:38:02,331 --> 01:38:03,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is?

1450
01:38:03,332 --> 01:38:04,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't Fall On Me.

1451
01:38:05,233 --> 01:38:05,973
[SPEAKER_09]: What album's that on?

1452
01:38:06,694 --> 01:38:08,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It was on Document, I think.

1453
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:16,659
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm disappointed to see that they don't have some of the Phil Collins stuff in there.

1454
01:38:16,679 --> 01:38:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones where it's Hold On, I guess?

1455
01:38:21,122 --> 01:38:22,743
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Land of Confusion.

1456
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:27,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I am just very excited to get to play Rick Springfield in Guitar Hero.

1457
01:38:27,522 --> 01:38:29,803
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going to be all kinds of awesome.

1458
01:38:29,883 --> 01:38:33,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Guitar Hero World Tour, although I don't think I'm going to have the whole setup in my house.

1459
01:38:33,764 --> 01:38:35,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play along with the charade.

1460
01:38:37,424 --> 01:38:40,505
[SPEAKER_04]: There doesn't seem to be a reason to change.

1461
01:38:40,725 --> 01:38:40,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1462
01:38:40,925 --> 01:38:43,706
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I feel so dirty when they start.

1463
01:38:44,826 --> 01:38:47,487
[SPEAKER_07]: May see if I get in the game only version, but I know I'm not buying another set.

1464
01:38:47,507 --> 01:38:49,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll probably get the... Well, I want the guitar.

1465
01:38:49,567 --> 01:38:50,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the new guitar and I want the game.

1466
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:51,828
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1467
01:38:52,995 --> 01:38:53,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't go away mad

1468
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:17,059
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my favorite Motley Crue song That was a freaking great album

1469
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Slice of Your Pie, Rattlesnake Shay, Kickstart My Heart.

1470
01:39:41,083 --> 01:39:42,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots and lots and lots of good songs coming out.

1471
01:39:42,864 --> 01:39:45,385
[SPEAKER_09]: No other random songs announced yet.

1472
01:39:45,445 --> 01:39:48,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the only ones they've announced so far.

1473
01:39:48,527 --> 01:39:54,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes there's been little random offerings from other bands that show up as well with the albums.

1474
01:39:55,510 --> 01:39:57,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Stephen Colbert have any other songs?

1475
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,972
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Singing in Korean on there.

1476
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:04,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see more South Park songs or more DVDA stuff.

1477
01:40:05,263 --> 01:40:06,104
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1478
01:40:06,124 --> 01:40:08,045
[SPEAKER_11]: They should be doing... They might be Giants.

1479
01:40:09,426 --> 01:40:10,867
[SPEAKER_11]: And more Jonathan Colton.

1480
01:40:11,487 --> 01:40:11,808
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1481
01:40:11,868 --> 01:40:14,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Skull Crusher Mountain, but I could totally use Ikea.

1482
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we need America, fuck yeah.

1483
01:40:16,951 --> 01:40:18,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the montage song.

1484
01:40:18,412 --> 01:40:20,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Gonna need a montage.

1485
01:40:20,313 --> 01:40:25,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, look, let's get into the Journey to the Wonderland song, because this song's awesome and it always means...

1486
01:40:26,357 --> 01:40:27,339
[SPEAKER_09]: That's mailbag time.

1487
01:40:27,859 --> 01:40:29,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week you send us mail at email.

1488
01:40:29,922 --> 01:40:32,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1489
01:40:32,867 --> 01:40:35,350
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura goes in the mailbag and reads her favorite emails.

1490
01:40:35,691 --> 01:40:40,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, since there was no show ended up getting posted on the feed last week, I believe we have slim pickings tonight.

1491
01:40:41,004 --> 01:40:43,005
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, well, let's read them.

1492
01:40:43,085 --> 01:40:43,766
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's hear them.

1493
01:40:44,526 --> 01:40:48,189
[SPEAKER_11]: This one comes from Robert M. That would be freaking rad.

1494
01:41:07,586 --> 01:41:08,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Has he launched yet?

1495
01:41:08,847 --> 01:41:11,107
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew he was a private citizen that was going to be going.

1496
01:41:11,328 --> 01:41:17,250
[SPEAKER_09]: He's one of the famous... He bought the Russian space tourist thing and I'd heard about that, but I didn't know if he'd actually gone yet.

1497
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:18,390
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I was thinking of Gradius.

1498
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:20,271
[SPEAKER_09]: It's supposed to happen this year at some point.

1499
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking of Gradius and Salamander.

1500
01:41:23,352 --> 01:41:24,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think it's quite like that.

1501
01:41:25,133 --> 01:41:27,033
[SPEAKER_11]: If he's got a little ship, that would be great.

1502
01:41:29,054 --> 01:41:32,336
[SPEAKER_09]: An ultimate game in space.

1503
01:41:32,856 --> 01:41:36,017
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, this is basically civilian in space, right?

1504
01:41:38,038 --> 01:41:40,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, except the civilian in question happens to be a famous game designer.

1505
01:41:41,661 --> 01:41:41,961
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it.

1506
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:43,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

1507
01:41:43,923 --> 01:41:57,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually think that it would be a very good thing, I think, to have more civilians, you know, to be able to have that go through, because that just puts us that much closer to colonizing the moon.

1508
01:41:58,976 --> 01:42:01,277
[SPEAKER_11]: and then Space Monkeys.

1509
01:42:02,418 --> 01:42:08,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I was looking at the little iPhone game that John has.

1510
01:42:09,622 --> 01:42:10,463
[SPEAKER_11]: The Space Monkey game.

1511
01:42:10,803 --> 01:42:11,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1512
01:42:11,863 --> 01:42:12,704
[SPEAKER_11]: We need Space Monkeys.

1513
01:42:14,815 --> 01:42:16,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Next one, shall we?

1514
01:42:16,536 --> 01:42:17,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, next email.

1515
01:42:17,317 --> 01:42:18,518
[SPEAKER_11]: This one comes from Rob with two Bs.

1516
01:42:19,579 --> 01:42:22,101
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if this is an old story, but I found it on Dig.

1517
01:42:22,521 --> 01:42:26,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of the myths debunked are the media effects on children.

1518
01:42:26,445 --> 01:42:33,010
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one myth I have personal debunking knowledge, and that's whether, because gamers are used to train soldiers to kill.

1519
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:37,393
[SPEAKER_11]: No, games are being used to train soldiers to kill, and they have the same impact on kids who play them.

1520
01:42:38,254 --> 01:43:07,602
[SPEAKER_11]: I used to work in trainers and simulators for the army and they're not even close to the games we play even when they use the same basic software it's modded for realism and specific training goals and he says he has the same shirt in the stock photo in the article I'm pulling up the article because I'd actually like to go over it if you don't mind the availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence and it actually says that we're at a 30 year low like I had brought that up before a while back right

1521
01:43:10,563 --> 01:43:31,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Scientific evidence links violent gameplay to youth aggression Claims like this are the work of researchers who represent one relatively narrow school of research media effects The research includes some 300 studies of media violence, but most of these studies are inconclusive and many have been criticized on methodical grounds

1522
01:43:33,094 --> 01:43:35,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, methodological grounds.

1523
01:43:36,296 --> 01:43:38,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Children are the primary market for video games.

1524
01:43:38,977 --> 01:43:43,781
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually the center of the video game market is actually older teen to adult.

1525
01:43:45,041 --> 01:43:46,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost no girls play computer games.

1526
01:43:46,783 --> 01:43:47,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Bullshit!

1527
01:43:49,295 --> 01:44:03,002
[SPEAKER_11]: and 5 was the one that Rob said in his email because it's to train soldiers to kill and that's no dude even anyone should know that 6 video games are not a meaningful form of expression

1528
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:06,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I love this one and it was also on my birthday.

1529
01:44:06,681 --> 01:44:08,583
[SPEAKER_11]: On April 19, 2002, U.S.

1530
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:10,964
[SPEAKER_11]: District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr.

1531
01:44:11,265 --> 01:44:16,268
[SPEAKER_11]: ruled that video games do not convey ideas and thus enjoy no constitutional protection.

1532
01:44:16,968 --> 01:44:17,709
[SPEAKER_11]: As evidenced, St.

1533
01:44:17,749 --> 01:44:28,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Louis County presented the judge with videotaped excerpts from four games, all within a narrow range of genre, and all the subject of previous controversy, overturning a similar decision in Indianapolis.

1534
01:44:28,476 --> 01:44:38,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner noted, "...violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive, theme of both culture high and low.

1535
01:44:38,527 --> 01:44:45,755
[SPEAKER_11]: It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm, Anderson, and Perrault are aware."

1536
01:44:46,716 --> 01:44:56,570
[SPEAKER_11]: To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be chaotic, but deforming.

1537
01:44:56,970 --> 01:45:00,195
[SPEAKER_11]: It would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.

1538
01:45:01,917 --> 01:45:06,221
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1539
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:33,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Never allowed to read anything but what her mother let her read, that type of thing.

1540
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:38,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's very, very ill-prepared for her life now.

1541
01:45:38,743 --> 01:45:41,724
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, to the point of about to lose her children.

1542
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:49,626
[SPEAKER_07]: And if kids don't know how to deal with a zombie infestation now, what's going to happen when it really does happen?

1543
01:45:49,706 --> 01:45:50,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously.

1544
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:53,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Video gameplay is socially isolating.

1545
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:58,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Much video gameplay is social.

1546
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Almost 60% of frequent gamers play with friends.

1547
01:46:02,171 --> 01:46:05,452
[SPEAKER_11]: 33% play with siblings and 25% play with spouses or parents.

1548
01:46:06,873 --> 01:46:09,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Video gameplay is desensitizing.

1549
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:11,754
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

1550
01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:19,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob D has a very funny comment in chat there.

1551
01:46:19,174 --> 01:46:20,877
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, video game play is isolating.

1552
01:46:21,197 --> 01:46:26,405
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I'm in a chat room with 40 other people and I've met a lot of them talking about the various conventions and stuff.

1553
01:46:26,786 --> 01:46:27,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1554
01:46:27,787 --> 01:46:27,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny.

1555
01:46:40,914 --> 01:46:42,415
[SPEAKER_11]: What's up, OLR hosts?

1556
01:46:42,595 --> 01:46:52,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Back at PAX, amongst the random conversation in between bites of delicious food at Wild Ginger, I mentioned that while I have friends that are into video games, I have no friends that are willing to make a podcast with me.

1557
01:46:53,004 --> 01:46:53,785
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1558
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:17,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you imagine you'd still be doing it after all of this time?

1559
01:47:17,582 --> 01:47:17,642
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1560
01:47:17,662 --> 01:47:17,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1561
01:47:17,762 --> 01:47:18,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we would.

1562
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:37,299
[SPEAKER_09]: After this long... I'm stubborn.

1563
01:47:37,419 --> 01:47:47,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Since Under Station Live ended, for me, I mean, obviously it's still going, but since it ended for me because of Travis's move, no, I didn't think this show would outlast Under Station Live.

1564
01:47:47,761 --> 01:47:48,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I really didn't.

1565
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,402
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've all... You're right.

1566
01:47:50,422 --> 01:47:52,643
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all been kind of stubborn and haven't gone anywhere.

1567
01:47:53,043 --> 01:47:59,785
[SPEAKER_09]: We're still here in SAC, and although our lives have all gone through significant changes, certainly nobody's really left or... You know what I mean?

1568
01:48:00,393 --> 01:48:05,657
[SPEAKER_11]: So I felt that I would keep, I would at least keep broadcasting in some way or another.

1569
01:48:07,239 --> 01:48:10,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I think that's part of the reason why Orange Lounge Radio was started in the first place.

1570
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:12,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So no, none of us had to be talked into it because you hit the nail on the head.

1571
01:48:12,963 --> 01:48:14,604
[SPEAKER_09]: We all kind of were doing it anyway.

1572
01:48:15,585 --> 01:48:18,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was kind of like a chance for us to kind of talk about something.

1573
01:48:18,628 --> 01:48:27,075
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't want to say that we wanted to talk about because we certainly had that outlet on Understation Live, but maybe something different that we felt we had a lot more to say, if that makes sense.

1574
01:48:27,735 --> 01:48:28,796
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's kind of where this started.

1575
01:48:29,585 --> 01:48:32,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, to continue, if I may.

1576
01:48:33,147 --> 01:48:33,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1577
01:48:33,327 --> 01:48:34,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, you may.

1578
01:48:35,388 --> 01:48:35,629
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1579
01:48:36,509 --> 01:48:37,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been listening to Rocky.

1580
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:39,351
[SPEAKER_11]: You may.

1581
01:48:40,151 --> 01:48:43,433
[SPEAKER_11]: When did you know it was something that you wanted to continue doing?

1582
01:48:45,834 --> 01:48:49,016
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was just sort of, we just sort of kept doing it.

1583
01:48:49,336 --> 01:48:51,678
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's not a conscious decision.

1584
01:48:51,718 --> 01:48:53,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we going to keep doing OLR?

1585
01:48:53,179 --> 01:48:58,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the moment that we had 12 listeners the first night and we were like, cool, somebody is actually listening to this.

1586
01:48:59,707 --> 01:49:01,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've grown since the 12 listeners.

1587
01:49:01,929 --> 01:49:04,091
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit, thanks to podcasting.

1588
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:08,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, were there any people you asked to host OLR that didn't want to do it?

1589
01:49:09,055 --> 01:49:14,160
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, are there any lost OLR hosts or hosts that could have been?

1590
01:49:15,106 --> 01:49:15,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob and I had a meeting.

1591
01:49:15,747 --> 01:49:17,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we just make Loki a host?

1592
01:49:17,088 --> 01:49:17,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1593
01:49:37,364 --> 01:49:38,064
[SPEAKER_11]: and Lo and Behold.

1594
01:49:38,705 --> 01:49:43,266
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the idea, the concept kind of formed between Jamie and I and that's where it is.

1595
01:49:43,966 --> 01:49:45,487
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no really other host considered.

1596
01:49:46,567 --> 01:49:51,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Guests, people, I think you've pretty much heard everybody we've wanted to have on the show.

1597
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:55,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I want Igarashi.

1598
01:49:55,571 --> 01:49:58,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, you know what I mean, like local wise and local other DDR peeps.

1599
01:49:59,912 --> 01:50:01,293
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get Dan back on the show.

1600
01:50:01,873 --> 01:50:02,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1601
01:50:02,593 --> 01:50:04,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, next paragraph.

1602
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:07,281
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I just want to say it real quick.

1603
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:08,621
[SPEAKER_11]: We also got another email in.

1604
01:50:08,661 --> 01:50:17,944
[SPEAKER_09]: VXChaseXV in chats, who's obviously been following us a long, long time, says the podcast specifically, podcasting into the main show, I think that was when it really hit the ground running.

1605
01:50:18,284 --> 01:50:22,725
[SPEAKER_09]: OLR moved on from just Bomani to video games that don't suck and podcasting.

1606
01:50:22,745 --> 01:50:23,766
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the real time.

1607
01:50:24,206 --> 01:50:29,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I admit, even the show does seem to have a different feel to it now, but it's a natural evolution.

1608
01:50:29,348 --> 01:50:30,888
[SPEAKER_11]: We got older.

1609
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:33,069
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually have a bit more structure.

1610
01:50:33,329 --> 01:50:33,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

1611
01:50:33,869 --> 01:50:34,870
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1612
01:50:54,115 --> 01:50:54,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Next paragraph.

1613
01:50:55,836 --> 01:50:58,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, what did you think about the Mega Man 9 downloadable content?

1614
01:51:15,723 --> 01:51:20,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I know gaming is a business and I appreciate that Capcom is in tune with the fans to put Proto Man in the game.

1615
01:51:21,350 --> 01:51:23,672
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish it didn't have to come at my expense.

1616
01:51:24,693 --> 01:51:26,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Rob D. P.S.

1617
01:51:27,376 --> 01:51:30,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Looks like I'll have to buy OE for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1618
01:51:30,219 --> 01:51:31,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Sad, I can't pass it up.

1619
01:51:32,713 --> 01:51:39,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob hit the nail on the head that this is kind of where we're seeing the industry going is that now we're having to pay for things we used to just unlock for fun, which is sad.

1620
01:51:40,559 --> 01:51:43,582
[SPEAKER_09]: But I can't give an opinion on the Mega Man 9 download content because I haven't got it.

1621
01:51:43,802 --> 01:51:44,662
[SPEAKER_11]: There's still unlockables.

1622
01:51:44,763 --> 01:51:46,344
[SPEAKER_09]: There are, but you know what I mean?

1623
01:51:46,424 --> 01:51:47,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Try the Proto Man thing.

1624
01:51:47,705 --> 01:51:48,105
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun.

1625
01:51:49,286 --> 01:51:49,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

1626
01:51:49,526 --> 01:51:50,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to check it out.

1627
01:51:50,767 --> 01:51:52,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Or as he was originally called, Blues.

1628
01:51:53,189 --> 01:51:54,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, Rob's apologizing for the long email.

1629
01:51:54,930 --> 01:51:55,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't apologize.

1630
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:56,311
[SPEAKER_09]: It was actually fun.

1631
01:51:56,411 --> 01:51:58,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little bit of retro.

1632
01:51:58,573 --> 01:51:59,714
[SPEAKER_11]: It gave us time to get another email.

1633
01:52:00,245 --> 01:52:08,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello all, a month after the Nintendo DS Game Dragon Quest 4 chapters of The Chosen was released, I finally had the chance to finish playing through the game and give it a somewhat in-depth review.

1634
01:52:19,897 --> 01:52:31,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I wound up playing the original Dragon Quest 4 and then chapters of The Chosen back to back in order to compare the remake to the original so I would better appreciate what the remake has to offer.

1635
01:52:32,045 --> 01:52:35,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Overall, the game is as close to perfect as a classic RPG can be.

1636
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:43,073
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely worth checking out for those who have played the original Dragon Quest 4 and those who have never played the game before alike.

1637
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:49,097
[SPEAKER_11]: As always, the full review can be found on my blog at AvengersTower.com or through my Twitter, Mar and Marvel.

1638
01:52:49,797 --> 01:52:51,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the great job, OLR.

1639
01:52:51,057 --> 01:52:54,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to coming out to Sacramento soon to see you all again.

1640
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:56,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's from Mari.

1641
01:52:56,259 --> 01:52:56,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

1642
01:52:57,039 --> 01:52:58,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever happened to her moving here?

1643
01:52:58,460 --> 01:52:59,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to copy the link in the chat box.

1644
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:01,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that still something that might happen?

1645
01:53:01,981 --> 01:53:02,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope.

1646
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:03,501
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish.

1647
01:53:03,781 --> 01:53:04,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope so, too.

1648
01:53:04,942 --> 01:53:05,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It must happen.

1649
01:53:06,445 --> 01:53:08,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Diablo III, Wizard, and

1650
01:53:31,009 --> 01:53:34,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell me the game will say Blue Wizard is about to die.

1651
01:53:35,116 --> 01:53:35,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Wrong game.

1652
01:53:36,558 --> 01:53:37,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, damn it.

1653
01:53:37,159 --> 01:53:38,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But the wizard is blue.

1654
01:53:39,143 --> 01:53:40,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, the wizard was yellow and gauntlet, but never mind.

1655
01:53:42,693 --> 01:53:44,074
[SPEAKER_09]: The wizard is blue in this one.

1656
01:53:44,174 --> 01:53:45,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, cool.

1657
01:53:46,495 --> 01:53:58,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, and then they didn't really say exactly too much about it other than the wizard can hurl lightning, can channel explosive arcane energies.

1658
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:00,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fucking wizard.

1659
01:54:00,062 --> 01:54:01,222
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do you need to know?

1660
01:54:01,302 --> 01:54:02,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

1661
01:54:02,543 --> 01:54:03,503
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fucking wizard.

1662
01:54:04,003 --> 01:54:06,945
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is it suddenly going to have a sword and shield?

1663
01:54:07,485 --> 01:54:08,225
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a wizard.

1664
01:54:08,446 --> 01:54:08,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Magic.

1665
01:54:08,846 --> 01:54:08,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Magic.

1666
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:12,697
[SPEAKER_07]: and Red Wizard that have a shortened shield there.

1667
01:54:13,417 --> 01:54:13,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1668
01:54:15,959 --> 01:54:16,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's it.

1669
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:17,681
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1670
01:54:18,181 --> 01:54:19,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, also some other news about Diablo 3.

1671
01:54:19,943 --> 01:54:23,265
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people have been begging Blizzard to put World of Warcraft on consoles.

1672
01:54:23,706 --> 01:54:32,213
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's interesting about Diablo 3 and some of the news that's come out about Diablo 3 is that possibly it could be coming to consoles.

1673
01:54:32,413 --> 01:54:36,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess this was based off a very veiled comment that came out of BlizzCon, but you know what?

1674
01:54:37,519 --> 01:54:38,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1675
01:54:55,208 --> 01:54:57,409
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, some other little tidbits out of BlizzCon.

1676
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:02,092
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll soon be able to use your mounts in the water in a future World of Warcraft patch.

1677
01:55:02,132 --> 01:55:06,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, if you try to run across a river on your mount, you will automatically dismount.

1678
01:55:06,774 --> 01:55:09,936
[SPEAKER_09]: But now your mounts will apparently work in the water, so you can try to drown your horse.

1679
01:55:09,976 --> 01:55:10,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that nice?

1680
01:55:11,397 --> 01:55:12,578
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

1681
01:55:13,018 --> 01:55:20,102
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, to hear some other things about BlizzCon, we're actually going to get an old OLR buddy here on the phone who is actually at BlizzCon.

1682
01:55:20,562 --> 01:55:23,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to talk to them about their experience at BlizzCon, so we're giving a call right now.

1683
01:55:25,643 --> 01:55:26,263
[SPEAKER_09]: One ringy dingy.

1684
01:55:29,525 --> 01:55:30,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Two ringy dingys.

1685
01:55:31,766 --> 01:55:32,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully he answers the phone.

1686
01:55:32,867 --> 01:55:33,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Hola.

1687
01:55:33,627 --> 01:55:35,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, is this Xtofer?

1688
01:55:36,929 --> 01:55:37,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Si.

1689
01:55:37,549 --> 01:55:39,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Hola, Xtofer.

1690
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Como estas?

1691
01:55:42,292 --> 01:55:43,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Esta bien, y tu?

1692
01:55:45,133 --> 01:55:46,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Muy mal.

1693
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:48,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1694
01:55:48,435 --> 01:55:48,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Por que?

1695
01:55:48,995 --> 01:55:51,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I didn't go to BlizzCon like you, you asshole.

1696
01:55:51,896 --> 01:55:53,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1697
01:55:54,098 --> 01:55:54,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know.

1698
01:55:55,649 --> 01:55:59,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to do for that, but I did, so whatever.

1699
01:56:00,291 --> 01:56:01,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well how was BlizzCon?

1700
01:56:01,511 --> 01:56:02,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us about the trip.

1701
01:56:02,352 --> 01:56:03,072
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do?

1702
01:56:03,212 --> 01:56:03,732
[SPEAKER_09]: How was it?

1703
01:56:04,052 --> 01:56:06,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk us through your experience at BlizzCon.

1704
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:10,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was pretty cool.

1705
01:56:10,695 --> 01:56:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We got there a day before it started and we picked up our bags and it was kind of confusing how to pick up our goodie bags.

1706
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we did, we got back to our hotels, kind of looked at it all.

1707
01:56:25,718 --> 01:56:30,799
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was a lot of stuff that was in there that they didn't list on the website actually.

1708
01:56:30,839 --> 01:56:41,201
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave us a bunch of, everybody got a free authenticator that was BlizzCon themed so it has like a BlizzCon logo on it and everything.

1709
01:56:41,721 --> 01:56:43,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, you got a free authenticator?

1710
01:56:43,862 --> 01:56:44,482
[SPEAKER_09]: You fucker.

1711
01:56:45,882 --> 01:56:47,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we all got that.

1712
01:56:47,083 --> 01:56:48,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry.

1713
01:56:49,963 --> 01:56:50,763
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that?

1714
01:56:50,803 --> 01:56:53,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry, go ahead.

1715
01:56:54,231 --> 01:56:54,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1716
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you too.

1717
01:56:57,293 --> 01:57:05,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, and then we got there in the morning the next day and pretty much watched the panels.

1718
01:57:05,338 --> 01:57:10,622
[SPEAKER_02]: We waited in line at the BlizzCon store for three hours before we got to the front of it.

1719
01:57:11,162 --> 01:57:12,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1720
01:57:12,723 --> 01:57:14,504
[SPEAKER_09]: What was so important that you had to get?

1721
01:57:16,025 --> 01:57:20,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted a shirt, and Annie, my sister, wanted...

1722
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:26,422
[SPEAKER_02]: also a shirt, and one of their little messenger bags that they have.

1723
01:57:26,862 --> 01:57:30,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, we waited really long for that.

1724
01:57:30,964 --> 01:57:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jim, my brother-in-law, got my sister a murloc, which was the big collectible thing this year, I guess.

1725
01:57:42,008 --> 01:57:43,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was pretty fun.

1726
01:57:43,988 --> 01:57:47,150
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of panels, a lot of exciting...

1727
01:57:48,888 --> 01:57:55,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that comment from Redertainment in chat right now He says, I waited three hours and all I got was this fucking shirt

1728
01:58:12,297 --> 01:58:13,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, that's what I said.

1729
01:58:13,357 --> 01:58:16,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I think that, uh, just, I don't know, like, it's very general, because a lot of things got big responses, um,

1730
01:58:39,945 --> 01:58:45,146
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was at the panels in particular, I was at the Dungeons and Raids panel.

1731
01:58:45,766 --> 01:58:48,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at half of the PvP panel.

1732
01:58:49,067 --> 01:58:55,968
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that class balance is really a big issue on a lot of people's minds.

1733
01:58:56,008 --> 01:59:01,369
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they going to balance the classes, especially with the Death Knights being the big new class?

1734
01:59:01,849 --> 01:59:05,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of really validated their...

1735
01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:09,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's Concerns, which I think made everyone happy.

1736
01:59:10,145 --> 01:59:20,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything that they said, every answer that they gave that had to do with class balances was particularly good to hear for a lot of people.

1737
01:59:20,922 --> 01:59:29,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if we mentioned it on this show yet tonight, but I think we were talking about it a little bit with Bobby when we were doing the tease on the Bobby Blackwolf show before us here on All Games Radio.

1738
01:59:29,508 --> 01:59:37,933
[SPEAKER_09]: We were mentioning that some guy had a Diablo 3 shirt that actually worked for Blizzard that had like unicorns and rainbows on it, and it was a Diablo 3 shirt.

1739
01:59:38,373 --> 01:59:39,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see that shirt?

1740
01:59:40,515 --> 01:59:44,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't see the shirt, but there was a funny thing that happened.

1741
01:59:46,089 --> 01:59:51,654
[SPEAKER_02]: During the closing ceremony, they actually showed that on the big screen.

1742
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:57,840
[SPEAKER_02]: They were making fun of Diablo 3, and then they showed it, and everybody just lost it.

1743
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:59,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy, but yeah, it was fun.

1744
02:00:00,282 --> 02:00:02,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Diablo 3... By the way... Go ahead.

1745
02:00:04,205 --> 02:00:04,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

1746
02:00:05,246 --> 02:00:10,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I was going to say, Patton Oswalt was incredibly funny.

1747
02:00:10,751 --> 02:00:12,653
[SPEAKER_02]: He is great to see in person.

1748
02:00:13,427 --> 02:00:16,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get your hands on any of the games that were on the floor?

1749
02:00:16,389 --> 02:00:17,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Because he had Diablo 3, Starcraft 2.

1750
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:19,331
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you play?

1751
02:00:42,028 --> 02:00:55,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, last year I played StarCraft II, and I'm not a big, like, real-time strategy, like, type of person, so I thought it was fine for what it was, but I did get a chance this year to play Diablo III, and I was sold.

1752
02:00:55,821 --> 02:00:57,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's definitely really fun.

1753
02:00:57,423 --> 02:01:02,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never played Diablo in my life before that, and it was absolutely wonderful.

1754
02:01:03,188 --> 02:01:05,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely recommend it when it comes out.

1755
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:06,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even...

1756
02:01:07,512 --> 02:01:11,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere near finished yet, which makes it even more incredible to me.

1757
02:01:11,735 --> 02:01:12,736
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the demo like?

1758
02:01:13,016 --> 02:01:14,077
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you get to do in the demo?

1759
02:01:15,838 --> 02:01:20,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you could choose your class, which there's only three playable classes right now.

1760
02:01:20,222 --> 02:01:23,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, you go into this dungeon-y area.

1761
02:01:24,485 --> 02:01:30,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, my sister and my brother-in-law, all three of us grouped up into a party.

1762
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:36,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all three just had fun, just kind of mashing the buttons and seeing what

1763
02:01:36,758 --> 02:01:40,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Abilities we could, you know, use or whatever.

1764
02:01:41,301 --> 02:01:45,945
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us had played the game before, so we didn't really know how to control it.

1765
02:01:46,025 --> 02:01:48,046
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were kind of noobs learning for the first time.

1766
02:01:48,527 --> 02:01:53,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was actually surprisingly easy, and there's a lot of different, like, creepy little enemies.

1767
02:01:54,991 --> 02:01:59,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I don't know, they're all, like, skeletal, and there's a lot of blood in it.

1768
02:01:59,535 --> 02:02:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And, I don't know, it's like a dungeon-y type place.

1769
02:02:03,458 --> 02:02:05,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1770
02:02:05,729 --> 02:02:07,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1771
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:10,510
[SPEAKER_09]: What would you say was the best thing about BlizzCon?

1772
02:02:13,051 --> 02:02:18,173
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing this year about BlizzCon was the contest ceremony.

1773
02:02:19,053 --> 02:02:21,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Jay Moore absolutely killed it.

1774
02:02:21,294 --> 02:02:27,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care if you don't like Jay Moore, I think he was hilarious and he actually created a lot of new fans that night.

1775
02:02:28,616 --> 02:02:32,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And the actual dance contest was

1776
02:02:33,149 --> 02:02:37,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Redertainment is asking, did someone ask Jay Moore if his show was cancelled?

1777
02:03:03,660 --> 02:03:11,783
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nobody got to ask Jay Moore anything, but I'm sure he'll have a canceled show within the next few weeks or so.

1778
02:03:12,703 --> 02:03:18,345
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Dark Knight wants to know, did you go to any of the tournaments that were going on?

1779
02:03:20,146 --> 02:03:24,187
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to, but there was so much going on that we actually didn't.

1780
02:03:24,587 --> 02:03:32,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of kept up to date on what was going on with the arena tournaments by looking on Wow Insider, like with my phone.

1781
02:03:33,834 --> 02:03:41,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was kind of cool because I guess there was a huge upset this year, but as far as I know, the area looked really cool.

1782
02:03:41,296 --> 02:03:42,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to walk by a few times.

1783
02:03:44,236 --> 02:03:45,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1784
02:03:45,357 --> 02:03:48,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Shaoran, speaking of your phone, actually wants to know, how's your iPhone?

1785
02:03:50,558 --> 02:03:53,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It freaking rocks, I guess.

1786
02:03:53,518 --> 02:03:53,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1787
02:03:53,998 --> 02:03:54,619
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

1788
02:03:54,699 --> 02:03:56,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of over the iPhone, actually.

1789
02:03:56,379 --> 02:04:01,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep on telling people that I might actually switch to a different phone in November.

1790
02:04:01,926 --> 02:04:05,870
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya wants to know if The Wizard was playable in Diablo 3.

1791
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:31,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, and I actually played The Wizard, and it was really fun.

1792
02:04:31,916 --> 02:04:33,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very impressed.

1793
02:04:34,897 --> 02:04:40,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, having not ever played the game before, I was thoroughly impressed by it.

1794
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:44,161
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for anybody that hasn't played the game before, I definitely recommend it.

1795
02:04:44,541 --> 02:04:52,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And from what I hear, most fans of Diablo are definitely going to want to play this.

1796
02:04:52,520 --> 02:05:02,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, really quickly, then we're going to let you go because this phone call is going on 10 minutes, but I want to know, did you meet other, because it's a convention, it's a meet and meet people, did you meet any other funny people?

1797
02:05:02,964 --> 02:05:06,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there some really weird ass people that you actually got to meet?

1798
02:05:08,245 --> 02:05:14,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there were weird ass people, but to tell you the truth, Rob, I don't want to meet any of those weird fuckers.

1799
02:05:18,149 --> 02:05:22,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't there somebody you were looking at from a distance going, that guy is fucking weird?

1800
02:05:23,556 --> 02:05:26,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially the people that ask questions on the panels.

1801
02:05:27,297 --> 02:05:27,838
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the best.

1802
02:05:27,878 --> 02:05:31,519
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, I'm a nerd.

1803
02:05:31,899 --> 02:05:34,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, did he even ask a question?

1804
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:35,681
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1805
02:05:35,861 --> 02:05:37,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they speak different languages?

1806
02:05:38,402 --> 02:05:38,942
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

1807
02:05:39,862 --> 02:05:40,142
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1808
02:05:40,602 --> 02:05:43,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, hey, Extifer, we've got to let you go so we can get back to our show.

1809
02:05:43,664 --> 02:05:45,144
[SPEAKER_09]: But thanks for the report on BlizzCon.

1810
02:05:45,184 --> 02:05:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe next year I can go.

1811
02:05:47,965 --> 02:05:48,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

1812
02:05:48,525 --> 02:05:48,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1813
02:05:48,905 --> 02:05:49,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1814
02:05:49,566 --> 02:05:49,846
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1815
02:05:50,206 --> 02:05:52,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, take care, Extifer, and come join us in the studio sometime.

1816
02:05:53,976 --> 02:05:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I will, definitely Alright, later dude Alright, bye Bye

1817
02:06:23,797 --> 02:06:29,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on and get to some more gaming news and then we'll get to the Skype line so the rest of y'all can call in and we'll start off.

1818
02:06:30,118 --> 02:06:31,578
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, go into a new game.

1819
02:06:33,059 --> 02:06:40,380
[SPEAKER_11]: For anyone who is interested in Call of Duty, Call of Duty 5 is going into beta next week for Xbox 360.

1820
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:42,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I should actually say this week.

1821
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:48,701
[SPEAKER_11]: There will be some sources that are giving out beta codes.

1822
02:06:48,721 --> 02:06:49,461
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to find them.

1823
02:06:50,221 --> 02:06:53,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought it was worth saying that Activision is starting testing now.

1824
02:06:55,049 --> 02:06:55,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1825
02:06:55,509 --> 02:06:57,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like last year, they did the same thing with Call of Duty 4.

1826
02:06:57,831 --> 02:07:01,973
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember I got into the beta last year.

1827
02:07:02,013 --> 02:07:03,254
[SPEAKER_07]: We only played it a few times.

1828
02:07:03,534 --> 02:07:06,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Eurogamer is giving out beta codes.

1829
02:07:06,616 --> 02:07:08,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So for our friends overseas, you can find it there.

1830
02:07:09,858 --> 02:07:10,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1831
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:11,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1832
02:07:12,148 --> 02:07:13,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

1833
02:07:13,949 --> 02:07:15,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, let's see here.

1834
02:07:16,051 --> 02:07:20,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Something back to the music gaming topic here.

1835
02:07:20,614 --> 02:07:27,339
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a brand new music game that's going to make some competition for Beatmania and Activision's new DJ hero.

1836
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:31,962
[SPEAKER_07]: That is Scratch, the ultimate DJ being announced.

1837
02:07:32,363 --> 02:07:35,325
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of a partnership of...

1838
02:07:37,535 --> 02:07:39,936
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1839
02:08:07,585 --> 02:08:09,926
[SPEAKER_07]: And overall, I mean, it looks pretty cool so far.

1840
02:08:09,947 --> 02:08:12,528
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we'll have to see more of a song list and that kind of thing.

1841
02:08:12,568 --> 02:08:18,571
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, maybe set the bar a little bit high for a DJ here whenever that comes out.

1842
02:08:18,671 --> 02:08:20,332
[SPEAKER_07]: But this, I don't know, looks pretty cool.

1843
02:08:20,572 --> 02:08:22,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft in chat gives a mandatory comment.

1844
02:08:22,573 --> 02:08:23,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami will sue!

1845
02:08:24,174 --> 02:08:24,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Will they?

1846
02:08:25,114 --> 02:08:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they may.

1847
02:08:25,955 --> 02:08:26,675
[SPEAKER_07]: They may sue.

1848
02:08:27,215 --> 02:08:27,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1849
02:08:27,956 --> 02:08:32,258
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty sad because their attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.

1850
02:08:33,899 --> 02:08:36,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And SSJ100Matt says, how can they not be sued for this?

1851
02:08:37,512 --> 02:08:38,313
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1852
02:08:52,335 --> 02:08:57,139
[SPEAKER_07]: FYI, VXChaseNXV argues with you and says Konami's attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.

1853
02:09:22,846 --> 02:09:23,727
[SPEAKER_09]: 15 versions in Japan.

1854
02:09:23,767 --> 02:09:24,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Their US attempt was great.

1855
02:09:24,989 --> 02:09:25,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the wrong locale.

1856
02:09:26,430 --> 02:09:27,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about the US one.

1857
02:09:27,911 --> 02:09:31,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it was alright, but what did they really do with it?

1858
02:09:32,256 --> 02:09:32,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

1859
02:09:33,037 --> 02:09:33,877
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know what?

1860
02:09:34,538 --> 02:09:43,067
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not going to do anything with your product that could probably sell very well, much like Guitar Freaks was...

1861
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:48,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Then, you know, you deserve to be left in the dust, I guess.

1862
02:09:49,632 --> 02:09:55,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like, you know, putting out a guitar game and a drum game years after everyone else has attempted it.

1863
02:09:55,795 --> 02:09:57,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Not probably a smart idea.

1864
02:09:59,337 --> 02:10:00,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I reluctantly agree.

1865
02:10:00,718 --> 02:10:03,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no patience for Konami in the music game world anymore.

1866
02:10:03,559 --> 02:10:05,360
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're not going to do it, someone else needs to beat them to it.

1867
02:10:06,466 --> 02:10:08,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I thought Beatmania in the US was fine.

1868
02:10:09,167 --> 02:10:10,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It was alright.

1869
02:10:10,228 --> 02:10:11,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at DDR.

1870
02:10:11,488 --> 02:10:13,309
[SPEAKER_07]: What exactly has changed in DDR lately?

1871
02:10:14,349 --> 02:10:14,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much.

1872
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:18,731
[SPEAKER_07]: How have they supported their games with downloadable content?

1873
02:10:19,231 --> 02:10:20,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very well.

1874
02:10:21,229 --> 02:10:30,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the quest mode in that game, in the universe games have sucked and they don't really listen to their fan base anymore.

1875
02:10:30,642 --> 02:10:33,386
[SPEAKER_07]: They just kind of do what they want because they're DDR and people will buy it.

1876
02:10:34,347 --> 02:10:35,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Universe 3 looks kind of cool.

1877
02:10:35,809 --> 02:10:36,911
[SPEAKER_07]: People will buy it for a while.

1878
02:10:38,206 --> 02:10:38,526
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1879
02:10:39,127 --> 02:10:42,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of DDR, there is another DDR game coming out.

1880
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:47,834
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves, and it's coming for the Wii.

1881
02:10:48,575 --> 02:10:49,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's what it sounds like.

1882
02:10:49,916 --> 02:10:53,079
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be 40 new Disney songs that are going to be coming to the Wii.

1883
02:10:53,819 --> 02:11:01,426
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and the standard press release comes out with this that, you know, apparently you can actually get your Mii in a Disney costume, and that's like what you can dance with in the game.

1884
02:11:01,966 --> 02:11:02,526
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1885
02:11:23,817 --> 02:11:24,497
[SPEAKER_09]: The Master Tracklist

1886
02:11:51,772 --> 02:11:55,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiki Room, or I'm sorry, the most awesome Disney song of all time, the Tiki Room.

1887
02:11:59,335 --> 02:12:01,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, you could be able to dance to that, right?

1888
02:12:01,275 --> 02:12:02,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you see yourself dancing to that?

1889
02:12:04,096 --> 02:12:06,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell me the Tiki Room isn't the most awesome Disney song of all time.

1890
02:12:07,578 --> 02:12:09,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Tiki Room is the best place to go when it's hot.

1891
02:12:10,038 --> 02:12:13,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Question, why do I see a song called Ducks in the Hood?

1892
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:15,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't ask.

1893
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:19,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Ducks in the Hood, really?

1894
02:12:22,466 --> 02:12:23,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to actually make a comment about that.

1895
02:12:23,566 --> 02:12:24,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It better have freaking dance magic in it.

1896
02:12:51,585 --> 02:12:52,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard.

1897
02:12:52,666 --> 02:12:53,206
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

1898
02:12:53,787 --> 02:12:54,347
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one.

1899
02:12:54,547 --> 02:12:58,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob did have to give me a story that I'm going to completely not give a shit about.

1900
02:12:59,551 --> 02:13:00,011
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?

1901
02:13:01,653 --> 02:13:02,753
[SPEAKER_11]: The Fitty Game.

1902
02:13:03,994 --> 02:13:10,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Blood on the Sand is going to be published by THQ.

1903
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:15,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Activision farted on the idea and said, we don't want this pile of steaming shit.

1904
02:13:16,764 --> 02:13:19,706
[SPEAKER_11]: So THQ said, wait, we like shit.

1905
02:13:21,601 --> 02:13:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Be fair, it doesn't look bad.

1906
02:13:22,742 --> 02:13:27,666
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just over the top and with no base in reality whatsoever.

1907
02:13:28,266 --> 02:13:32,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if they made Oscars for video games, this would so be nominated next year.

1908
02:13:32,990 --> 02:13:35,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's coming out sometime.

1909
02:13:35,952 --> 02:13:37,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Phew, rest easy.

1910
02:13:38,214 --> 02:13:40,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, THQ, for giving the gamers.

1911
02:13:40,275 --> 02:13:40,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, THQ, for our 50.

1912
02:13:40,976 --> 02:13:45,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know.

1913
02:13:45,139 --> 02:13:46,580
[SPEAKER_07]: They have like 50 cent and...

1914
02:13:48,393 --> 02:13:49,416
[SPEAKER_07]: These games sell.

1915
02:13:50,017 --> 02:13:50,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1916
02:13:50,959 --> 02:13:51,621
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll sell.

1917
02:13:53,063 --> 02:13:54,864
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be surprised, I know, I know.

1918
02:13:55,504 --> 02:13:57,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, a couple more stories for you guys.

1919
02:13:57,145 --> 02:14:00,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1920
02:14:01,386 --> 02:14:08,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the new Xbox Experience, a brand new update that's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.

1921
02:14:09,290 --> 02:14:12,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's been wondering, when the hell is this thing coming out?

1922
02:14:12,091 --> 02:14:14,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hopefully we have your answer now.

1923
02:14:15,372 --> 02:14:19,394
[SPEAKER_07]: It was announced during Tokyo Game Show that it will be available to download online.

1924
02:14:20,007 --> 02:14:21,767
[SPEAKER_07]: on November 19th.

1925
02:14:22,327 --> 02:14:25,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's when you get your brand new Xbox experience.

1926
02:14:26,168 --> 02:14:32,729
[SPEAKER_07]: The download will take up 128 megabytes of hard drive space or storage space.

1927
02:14:33,589 --> 02:14:38,990
[SPEAKER_07]: People have been concerned and kind of in an uproar about, well, why is it going to require space?

1928
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:42,091
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some 360s that are sold without storage.

1929
02:14:42,191 --> 02:14:43,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I correct you.

1930
02:14:43,711 --> 02:14:48,652
[SPEAKER_07]: There are no Xbox 360s currently being sold without storage of any kind.

1931
02:14:49,292 --> 02:14:59,717
[SPEAKER_07]: If you remember, the arcade systems do come with a 256MB memory unit, so you can still enjoy the next Xbox experience, I guess.

1932
02:15:00,577 --> 02:15:05,620
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't have a fucking memory card or hard drive, I mean, seriously, what the hell's wrong with you?

1933
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:07,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Just buy a hard drive.

1934
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you probably don't care about the new Xbox experience either.

1935
02:15:10,102 --> 02:15:10,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly.

1936
02:15:11,423 --> 02:15:17,725
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um... Although I do still think it was a mistake for Microsoft to just not put the hard drive with all the systems.

1937
02:15:17,825 --> 02:15:19,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they wanted to drive the price down, whatever.

1938
02:15:20,386 --> 02:15:21,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, I mean, honestly.

1939
02:15:21,886 --> 02:15:22,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine.

1940
02:15:23,206 --> 02:15:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that's rumored to be coming out on the 19th as well, well, apparently Home may be coming out that day as well to kind of counteract the whole new Xbox experience.

1941
02:15:33,429 --> 02:15:38,391
[SPEAKER_07]: And it makes perfect sense to me, because even if it's not done, they're going to release it anyways, because it's still in beta.

1942
02:15:39,744 --> 02:15:45,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, beta, awesome So yeah, expect that probably around the same time as well

1943
02:15:47,902 --> 02:15:48,242
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1944
02:15:48,703 --> 02:15:50,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to the new Xbox experience?

1945
02:15:50,364 --> 02:15:51,144
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it looks pretty cool.

1946
02:15:52,165 --> 02:15:52,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really.

1947
02:15:53,606 --> 02:16:01,171
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one thing I'm looking forward to about it is that they are going to add new 16 by 10 screen formats.

1948
02:16:01,871 --> 02:16:05,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, for example, if I'm playing on my monitor that's 1400 by 900, I think by 900.

1949
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:19,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I can actually use the full screen now because before it was kind of stretched a little bit but now it'll actually be the native resolution for widescreen monitors.

1950
02:16:20,373 --> 02:16:20,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1951
02:16:21,906 --> 02:16:22,486
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1952
02:16:43,779 --> 02:16:51,102
[SPEAKER_09]: And according to this Paula Hall, she was actually doing this whole study on premature ejaculation was actually what the study was all about.

1953
02:16:51,222 --> 02:16:53,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's what I said, premature ejaculation.

1954
02:16:53,723 --> 02:16:55,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And you might be thinking, what the hell does this have to do with video games?

1955
02:16:56,224 --> 02:16:59,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's because of an interesting comment she actually said as a part of this.

1956
02:16:59,646 --> 02:17:03,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological.

1957
02:17:04,228 --> 02:17:08,929
[SPEAKER_09]: These men with non-psychological premature ejaculation have very quick reflexes.

1958
02:17:09,310 --> 02:17:12,191
[SPEAKER_09]: They may be excellent at playing tennis or computer games.

1959
02:17:14,113 --> 02:17:42,607
[SPEAKER_09]: so apparently according to this chick there's some type of correlation between being a good gamer and finishing quickly in the bedroom maybe it's because they're just waiting to get back to the game that doesn't make any sense blame Paula Hall I don't know that still doesn't make any sense apparently what they're trying to do with this whole thing they're trying to actually make drugs to reduce the likelihood of premature ejaculation like Viagra in reverse I guess a little bit

1960
02:17:43,544 --> 02:17:45,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

1961
02:17:45,945 --> 02:17:47,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if this is a problem for women.

1962
02:17:49,727 --> 02:17:50,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Premature ejaculation.

1963
02:17:50,787 --> 02:17:51,268
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1964
02:17:51,628 --> 02:17:51,908
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1965
02:17:53,529 --> 02:17:55,850
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem for women is men.

1966
02:17:57,771 --> 02:17:58,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Men are impatient.

1967
02:18:02,113 --> 02:18:02,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm done.

1968
02:18:02,893 --> 02:18:03,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Back to the game.

1969
02:18:03,573 --> 02:18:04,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, lady.

1970
02:18:04,074 --> 02:18:06,015
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what else is a problem, too?

1971
02:18:06,135 --> 02:18:08,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Women keep nagging them when they're trying to play their games.

1972
02:18:10,057 --> 02:18:12,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Honey, come to bed.

1973
02:18:12,418 --> 02:18:13,738
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why God made toys.

1974
02:18:15,838 --> 02:18:16,138
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1975
02:18:16,699 --> 02:18:17,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving forward.

1976
02:18:17,419 --> 02:18:17,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1977
02:18:17,979 --> 02:18:19,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to the Skype line.

1978
02:18:19,379 --> 02:18:21,800
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to our phones.

1979
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:25,120
[SPEAKER_09]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1980
02:18:25,160 --> 02:18:26,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And hey, we've got a call on the line.

1981
02:18:26,981 --> 02:18:28,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, caller, are you there?

1982
02:18:29,781 --> 02:18:30,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1983
02:18:30,422 --> 02:18:31,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, who is this?

1984
02:18:32,782 --> 02:18:33,802
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Rice Princess.

1985
02:18:34,062 --> 02:18:35,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Rice Princess.

1986
02:18:35,663 --> 02:18:36,203
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

1987
02:18:38,246 --> 02:18:39,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm okay.

1988
02:18:39,387 --> 02:18:39,967
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

1989
02:18:40,167 --> 02:18:40,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.

1990
02:18:40,608 --> 02:18:47,512
[SPEAKER_09]: We're hearing from a lot of local OLR folks tonight, because I don't know if you heard, but Extifer was on the show earlier talking about BlizzCon.

1991
02:18:49,673 --> 02:18:51,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boo, BlizzCon.

1992
02:18:52,255 --> 02:18:53,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what did you call in to tell us about tonight?

1993
02:18:53,736 --> 02:18:54,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a cooler con.

1994
02:18:54,996 --> 02:18:56,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you went to a cooler con this week.

1995
02:18:56,337 --> 02:18:57,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you go to Tokyo Game Show?

1996
02:18:59,519 --> 02:18:59,899
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1997
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I go to that crap?

1998
02:19:02,481 --> 02:19:06,063
[SPEAKER_09]: You went to a con that was cooler than Tokyo Game Show and BlizzCon combined?

1999
02:19:06,343 --> 02:19:06,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Where did you go?

2000
02:19:08,514 --> 02:19:10,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I went to QQCon.

2001
02:19:10,795 --> 02:19:11,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome!

2002
02:19:11,415 --> 02:19:12,575
[SPEAKER_09]: QQCon!

2003
02:19:12,716 --> 02:19:13,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to QQCon, too.

2004
02:19:13,856 --> 02:19:14,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I saw you there.

2005
02:19:14,856 --> 02:19:17,137
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there was a lot of people there, but I think I saw you in the crowd.

2006
02:19:18,777 --> 02:19:21,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I ran across you once or twice.

2007
02:19:21,718 --> 02:19:23,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

2008
02:19:23,579 --> 02:19:27,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell the listeners something about QQCon, because I bet nobody's ever heard of QQCon.

2009
02:19:27,480 --> 02:19:30,881
[SPEAKER_09]: But didn't you have something to do with the starting of QQCon?

2010
02:19:33,077 --> 02:19:37,580
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was actually organized by two of our friends, Mel and Eric.

2011
02:19:38,601 --> 02:19:42,503
[SPEAKER_03]: But we just actually held it at our venue, aka our apartment.

2012
02:19:43,804 --> 02:19:47,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's just awesome and free.

2013
02:19:48,507 --> 02:19:48,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Free?

2014
02:19:49,047 --> 02:19:50,648
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

2015
02:19:50,708 --> 02:19:54,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell the listeners a little something about the idea behind QQCon.

2016
02:19:54,090 --> 02:19:55,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Why was there a QQCon?

2017
02:19:55,631 --> 02:19:57,172
[SPEAKER_09]: What were we celebrating at QQCon?

2018
02:19:58,951 --> 02:20:09,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, well, you know how there was BlizzCon this weekend, and, like, you know, a lot of us didn't get to go because they had this ridiculous lottery system to have to, like, get tickets and stupid crap like that?

2019
02:20:09,755 --> 02:20:10,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2020
02:20:10,575 --> 02:20:20,899
[SPEAKER_03]: We just kind of had our own convention, and it's the QQCon because, as we all know, QQ means crying in the game, because the QQs look like crying eyes.

2021
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:26,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were all just basically convening to cry about not going to BlizzCon.

2022
02:20:27,011 --> 02:20:30,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there any cosplay at the tournament, or at the convention, asked SSJ100 Matt.

2023
02:20:33,475 --> 02:20:43,621
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no cosplay, but we all got swag in the form of Frostmourne, and we all welded them and played around with them and stuff.

2024
02:20:45,422 --> 02:20:46,142
[SPEAKER_03]: If that counts.

2025
02:20:47,243 --> 02:20:48,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Will there be a QQCon next year?

2026
02:20:50,885 --> 02:20:51,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

2027
02:20:52,045 --> 02:20:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be one every year from here on out.

2028
02:20:55,575 --> 02:20:55,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone's invited.

2029
02:20:56,016 --> 02:20:57,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we would just have it in the hotel or something.

2030
02:21:17,217 --> 02:21:24,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to find a larger venue according to how many people actually sign up for next year's QQCon.

2031
02:21:24,803 --> 02:21:28,125
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to see about that.

2032
02:21:28,185 --> 02:21:31,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other video games you've been playing this week you want to tell our listeners about?

2033
02:21:33,489 --> 02:21:33,809
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2034
02:21:36,611 --> 02:21:42,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play anything except for WarioWare at QQCon because it's the best con ever.

2035
02:21:42,736 --> 02:21:44,077
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.

2036
02:21:44,117 --> 02:21:45,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2037
02:21:47,865 --> 02:21:50,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, you have to poop at QQCon.

2038
02:21:50,486 --> 02:21:53,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I had YYCon.

2039
02:21:54,208 --> 02:21:55,249
[SPEAKER_09]: What's YYCon?

2040
02:21:55,969 --> 02:21:56,669
[SPEAKER_11]: YY!

2041
02:21:56,949 --> 02:21:57,530
[SPEAKER_11]: It means yay.

2042
02:21:59,571 --> 02:22:01,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did have to poop at QQCon.

2043
02:22:03,132 --> 02:22:04,373
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be an event next year.

2044
02:22:04,473 --> 02:22:05,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm hanging up.

2045
02:22:05,333 --> 02:22:07,154
[SPEAKER_09]: This joke's gone on way too long.

2046
02:22:08,715 --> 02:22:09,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye, Rice Princess!

2047
02:22:11,296 --> 02:22:11,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2048
02:22:11,957 --> 02:22:12,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

2049
02:22:12,437 --> 02:22:13,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Did she just poop in the phone?

2050
02:22:13,757 --> 02:22:14,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she did.

2051
02:22:15,071 --> 02:22:16,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that was a poop.

2052
02:22:16,492 --> 02:22:18,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was a fart.

2053
02:22:19,373 --> 02:22:20,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2054
02:22:20,814 --> 02:22:21,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2055
02:22:22,655 --> 02:22:24,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Spaz.

2056
02:22:24,596 --> 02:22:25,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, Spaz?

2057
02:22:26,998 --> 02:22:27,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Not much.

2058
02:22:28,458 --> 02:22:32,501
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to comment on something that you were saying earlier in the show.

2059
02:22:32,821 --> 02:22:33,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2060
02:22:34,462 --> 02:22:38,244
[SPEAKER_12]: If I remember right, you were mentioning that you're considering getting a PlayStation 3.

2061
02:22:39,084 --> 02:22:39,545
[SPEAKER_10]: The what?

2062
02:22:39,605 --> 02:22:39,905
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry?

2063
02:22:41,484 --> 02:22:46,026
[SPEAKER_12]: If I remember right, you mentioned you're considering getting a PlayStation 3?

2064
02:22:46,507 --> 02:22:49,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it's past the point of consideration.

2065
02:22:49,168 --> 02:22:50,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to happen.

2066
02:22:50,349 --> 02:22:51,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a question of when.

2067
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:58,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'm fully in support of you getting it.

2068
02:22:58,474 --> 02:23:02,217
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that if you do get it, you'll really enjoy it.

2069
02:23:02,257 --> 02:23:08,961
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing to bear in mind is that it wouldn't be a good idea to compare it to

2070
02:23:10,652 --> 02:23:15,415
[SPEAKER_12]: The 360 in any way, because it's kind of, in its own way, its own beast.

2071
02:23:16,196 --> 02:23:19,958
[SPEAKER_12]: If you try to compare it to the 360, you'll probably come off disappointed.

2072
02:23:21,239 --> 02:23:27,543
[SPEAKER_09]: What kinds of cool things am I going to find on the PlayStation 3 that I'm not going to get on the Xbox 360, in your opinion?

2073
02:23:27,603 --> 02:23:39,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, as you probably know, there's not a whole lot of system exclusives in terms of games, but what few there are, I think you may like...

2074
02:23:40,643 --> 02:23:49,529
[SPEAKER_12]: stuff like Solcom, Warhawk, some of the downloadable original PlayStation 1 games.

2075
02:23:50,010 --> 02:23:52,811
[SPEAKER_12]: They do have some, you know, interactive art there.

2076
02:23:52,831 --> 02:23:57,715
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, I was just talking about one with Bobby Blackwolf on his show.

2077
02:23:59,316 --> 02:24:05,100
[SPEAKER_12]: And the most recent one is kind of weird, but it's still interesting nonetheless.

2078
02:24:07,179 --> 02:24:17,527
[SPEAKER_12]: and then of course there's the whole PixelJunk series of games including PixelJunk Monsters which is kind of like a tower defense game which is pretty fun.

2079
02:24:18,428 --> 02:24:24,852
[SPEAKER_12]: I could go on and on in terms of games but I don't want to take up too much time on the show.

2080
02:24:26,333 --> 02:24:32,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And plus there's one benefit to the PlayStation 3's video store that

2081
02:24:36,169 --> 02:24:49,914
[SPEAKER_12]: The 360 doesn't do all that well in the sense that with the 360, you can't always rent the movies, whereas PlayStation 3 gives you the choice between renting or outright buying.

2082
02:24:51,474 --> 02:25:00,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people are kind of against renting, they would rather buy, because once you see the movie,

2083
02:25:01,212 --> 02:25:04,573
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you're basically out a couple bucks.

2084
02:25:04,633 --> 02:25:13,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas, you know, once you buy the movie, if you're outright buying the movie, you can watch it as many times as you want whenever you want.

2085
02:25:14,295 --> 02:25:16,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, but doesn't the PlayStation 3 kind of do both?

2086
02:25:16,776 --> 02:25:20,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, don't they have Blu-ray and they have a download service now?

2087
02:25:21,837 --> 02:25:24,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's absolutely right.

2088
02:25:24,278 --> 02:25:26,638
[SPEAKER_12]: So basically you have a choice.

2089
02:25:27,138 --> 02:25:30,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Blu-ray is a little bit more expensive.

2090
02:25:31,330 --> 02:25:36,853
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, you get all the extras.

2091
02:25:38,134 --> 02:25:39,154
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in high def.

2092
02:25:39,875 --> 02:25:45,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And since it's on the desk, it won't take up any space on your hard drive.

2093
02:25:46,618 --> 02:25:51,561
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas if you buy from the download service, you won't get the extras.

2094
02:25:52,581 --> 02:25:57,824
[SPEAKER_12]: If you buy the movies, they'll be in standard definitions.

2095
02:25:58,319 --> 02:25:59,120
[SPEAKER_12]: but you'll get a cheaper price point.

2096
02:25:59,140 --> 02:26:02,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, it may be 24 bucks in and around the area but at least in my area, which is in western New York, they're closer to like

2097
02:26:25,026 --> 02:26:27,248
[SPEAKER_12]: on the cheap end, like $30, it's probably $35.

2098
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry, just kind of a random tangent, but hey, that movie was actually pretty cheap because HD DVD had already bit the dust at that point when I got that.

2099
02:26:46,986 --> 02:26:51,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Question from Frisbee in chat, and this will be the last one, then we're going to get to one more call before we end the show tonight.

2100
02:26:51,909 --> 02:26:55,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee wants to know, is Blu-ray really that good?

2101
02:26:57,754 --> 02:27:00,396
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, in my opinion, yes.

2102
02:27:00,736 --> 02:27:08,482
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like to give an analogy in terms of games, it's

2103
02:27:09,972 --> 02:27:25,040
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like trying to play Halo 3 as opposed to the original NES version of Washington Attack.

2104
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:29,963
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in terms of graphics, not in terms of fun or anything like that.

2105
02:27:30,744 --> 02:27:38,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Halo 3 is at least a bounce better than Washington Attack in terms of graphics.

2106
02:27:39,908 --> 02:27:45,891
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think a big part of it, too, is that, you know, it's kind of like watching HDTV for the first time compared to regular TV.

2107
02:27:45,951 --> 02:27:55,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, true DVDs are a little, slightly better than regular TV, like the old TVs, because they can do interlaced, but, you know, it's just, you know, it's a big step.

2108
02:27:56,034 --> 02:28:00,496
[SPEAKER_09]: So, well, anyway, hey, Spaz, we've got to wrap up, but do you have any quick last thoughts for our listeners?

2109
02:28:01,777 --> 02:28:07,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, obviously I can't do it now, but probably during the week, if you like, I can, like,

2110
02:28:08,224 --> 02:28:15,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Send your email with a list of recommended games and whatnot that you can enjoy.

2111
02:28:15,749 --> 02:28:16,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll always take a look, Spaz.

2112
02:28:16,910 --> 02:28:18,051
[SPEAKER_09]: You can email that to me anytime.

2113
02:28:19,271 --> 02:28:19,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

2114
02:28:19,812 --> 02:28:20,032
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2115
02:28:20,052 --> 02:28:20,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one.

2116
02:28:20,752 --> 02:28:20,953
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2117
02:28:20,973 --> 02:28:21,453
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a good one.

2118
02:28:21,493 --> 02:28:21,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care, buddy.

2119
02:28:22,794 --> 02:28:23,094
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2120
02:28:23,114 --> 02:28:23,394
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

2121
02:28:23,434 --> 02:28:23,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye-bye.

2122
02:28:23,834 --> 02:28:24,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

2123
02:28:24,415 --> 02:28:28,177
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll do one more call here on the skyline, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2124
02:28:28,718 --> 02:28:29,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2125
02:28:29,838 --> 02:28:30,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2126
02:28:31,038 --> 02:28:32,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.

2127
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:37,424
[SPEAKER_06]: It is he who is very uncreative and can't think of a way of describing himself tonight.

2128
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:38,685
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you just call yourself Jason?

2129
02:28:39,106 --> 02:28:40,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, yeah, that works too.

2130
02:28:40,107 --> 02:28:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guys, it's Jason.

2131
02:28:41,008 --> 02:28:41,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how you doing?

2132
02:28:41,788 --> 02:28:42,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you know, it's so funny.

2133
02:28:42,609 --> 02:28:45,492
[SPEAKER_09]: You can totally tell the difference between the telephone calls and the Skype calls.

2134
02:28:46,393 --> 02:28:48,255
[SPEAKER_09]: The Skype calls really are pretty clear.

2135
02:28:48,275 --> 02:28:49,796
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet takes off for phones pretty soon.

2136
02:28:50,097 --> 02:28:50,477
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

2137
02:28:50,517 --> 02:28:51,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's on your mind, Jason?

2138
02:28:53,320 --> 02:28:53,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

2139
02:28:54,181 --> 02:28:55,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't remember all of the details specifically.

2140
02:28:55,922 --> 02:29:00,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I was driving into work and my iPhone tuner app was cutting out so I didn't get all of the conversation.

2141
02:29:00,944 --> 02:29:05,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I keep forgetting that people can actually listen to this show in the car now because of Edge.

2142
02:29:05,426 --> 02:29:06,167
[SPEAKER_09]: That is nuts.

2143
02:29:06,827 --> 02:29:12,670
[SPEAKER_06]: We plug it straight into the car stereo and when 3G decides to actually work properly...

2144
02:29:13,072 --> 02:29:15,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I can just be listening to whatever I want, in this case, the show.

2145
02:29:15,873 --> 02:29:17,074
[SPEAKER_09]: That is amazing.

2146
02:29:17,194 --> 02:29:18,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Technology has come so far.

2147
02:29:18,695 --> 02:29:19,935
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to tell me how you do that.

2148
02:29:19,995 --> 02:29:21,536
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you're looking at Justin.TV.

2149
02:29:21,596 --> 02:29:24,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I just finally picked up the iPhone this week.

2150
02:29:25,538 --> 02:29:26,658
[SPEAKER_09]: All I have is Twitterific.

2151
02:29:27,738 --> 02:29:30,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I got Tap Tap Revolution or whatever it's called, Tap Tap Mania.

2152
02:29:30,980 --> 02:29:32,481
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a terrible game.

2153
02:29:32,681 --> 02:29:33,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's a little stupid.

2154
02:29:33,841 --> 02:29:35,062
[SPEAKER_06]: I hated that game so bad.

2155
02:29:35,942 --> 02:29:36,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like Tuner.

2156
02:29:59,295 --> 02:29:59,775
[SPEAKER_09]: AOL Radio is free.

2157
02:29:59,795 --> 02:30:00,156
[SPEAKER_09]: They shouldn't...

2158
02:30:24,451 --> 02:30:27,596
[SPEAKER_06]: The iPhones only sell unlimited data plans, right?

2159
02:30:28,137 --> 02:30:28,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they do.

2160
02:30:28,938 --> 02:30:30,060
[SPEAKER_09]: It just blows my mind, though.

2161
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:31,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just your phone streaming the station.

2162
02:30:36,001 --> 02:30:36,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2163
02:30:36,881 --> 02:30:37,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, sorry.

2164
02:30:37,541 --> 02:30:39,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to try that later.

2165
02:30:39,022 --> 02:30:41,942
[SPEAKER_09]: It just blows my mind that somebody could be actually listening to us in the car right now.

2166
02:30:42,302 --> 02:30:45,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven years ago, when we only had 12 listeners, I never thought that possible.

2167
02:30:45,603 --> 02:30:53,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But we really are starting to reach that day and age where you will be able to listen to us like an over-the-air wave show.

2168
02:30:54,065 --> 02:30:54,465
[SPEAKER_09]: We're there.

2169
02:30:55,065 --> 02:30:56,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not many people are doing it.

2170
02:30:56,526 --> 02:30:57,026
[SPEAKER_09]: It's crazy.

2171
02:30:57,906 --> 02:31:05,668
[SPEAKER_06]: If Sprint actually kicks into high gear and really gets WiMAXed everywhere, then it's going to be a really good day because then PSPs and all of the other non-cellular networks

2172
02:31:06,058 --> 02:31:09,740
[SPEAKER_06]: but wireless capable devices are going to be able to do the same thing just about anywhere.

2173
02:31:10,220 --> 02:31:10,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, I'm sorry.

2174
02:31:11,041 --> 02:31:13,002
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably didn't call in to talk about Tuner.

2175
02:31:13,122 --> 02:31:13,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't care.

2176
02:31:13,703 --> 02:31:14,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I love technology.

2177
02:31:14,543 --> 02:31:14,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you kidding me?

2178
02:31:14,963 --> 02:31:16,944
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys were a tech show, I'd be on here all the time.

2179
02:31:17,125 --> 02:31:17,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me guess.

2180
02:31:18,565 --> 02:31:24,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably had something to say about the beat and groovy or beat me because we've been talking a lot about music games tonight.

2181
02:31:24,249 --> 02:31:25,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Beat and groovy is a joke.

2182
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:27,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say two things.

2183
02:31:27,631 --> 02:31:29,192
[SPEAKER_06]: That was going to be the shorter of two things.

2184
02:31:29,792 --> 02:31:32,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I reiterate what I said before, but I make it worse.

2185
02:31:32,414 --> 02:31:34,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami needs to stop releasing in America.

2186
02:31:36,638 --> 02:31:39,419
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to hold a candle to what every other company has now done.

2187
02:31:40,100 --> 02:31:49,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And while I think Scratch looks really terrible, it's probably going to perform better, look better, and work better than Beatmania US, quite unfortunately.

2188
02:31:49,223 --> 02:31:51,704
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably going to do better because of the music choice.

2189
02:31:52,904 --> 02:31:54,085
[SPEAKER_09]: They never should have closed Hawaii.

2190
02:31:55,845 --> 02:31:57,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And they never should have moved Konami SoCal.

2191
02:31:57,846 --> 02:31:57,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

2192
02:31:58,433 --> 02:31:59,593
[SPEAKER_06]: or Dorkel, whichever.

2193
02:31:59,833 --> 02:32:06,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and a lot of us gave Konami Hawaii a lot of shit when that first DDR game came out on Xbox, but boy did the second one shut us all up.

2194
02:32:06,654 --> 02:32:10,055
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it seemed like they, more than any other division, were really listening to people.

2195
02:32:10,095 --> 02:32:12,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought we gave them shit because they released DDR PC.

2196
02:32:14,196 --> 02:32:16,836
[SPEAKER_09]: But without DDR PC, we would have never had Mr. Spanky.

2197
02:32:16,956 --> 02:32:18,417
[SPEAKER_09]: So, case in point.

2198
02:32:20,617 --> 02:32:21,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, sorry.

2199
02:32:21,757 --> 02:32:23,817
[SPEAKER_09]: What else besides beaten groovy?

2200
02:32:24,018 --> 02:32:24,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Beaten yucky?

2201
02:32:25,658 --> 02:32:26,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Old and crappy.

2202
02:32:27,125 --> 02:32:28,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty wrong on StarCraft 2.

2203
02:32:29,888 --> 02:32:37,435
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that they're veiling this, if I'm understanding correctly, I'm seeing two sides to the story, but neither of your opinions matched it.

2204
02:32:37,655 --> 02:32:38,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's my take.

2205
02:32:39,937 --> 02:32:49,286
[SPEAKER_06]: The release date is, I don't know if this has actually been mentioned, but the release date for the three StarCraft 2s is probably going to be on the same day or very, very close together, isn't it?

2206
02:32:51,155 --> 02:32:51,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't the clue.

2207
02:32:52,216 --> 02:32:54,097
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't follow BlizzCon that closely.

2208
02:32:54,397 --> 02:32:56,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's been announced.

2209
02:32:56,418 --> 02:32:59,379
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the fact that it's going to be a trilogy and that's what everybody's going over.

2210
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:10,205
[SPEAKER_06]: The same thing that Bobby was saying, and I'll do it in the same way as him, you're going to buy one game three times, you're going to buy one game three times, and you will buy one game three times.

2211
02:33:10,245 --> 02:33:11,226
[SPEAKER_06]: He's absolutely correct.

2212
02:33:11,646 --> 02:33:17,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They are going to take one game, give the same features on all three to play with other people.

2213
02:33:17,889 --> 02:33:18,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good feature.

2214
02:33:18,609 --> 02:33:19,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad they're doing that.

2215
02:33:20,467 --> 02:33:21,088
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

2216
02:33:49,736 --> 02:34:04,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping and assuming that they're going to make it a little bit cheaper because $150 just to play a game that presumably you'll want to complete paying $150 is going to be excessive and I'm really hoping that each game is going to be

2217
02:34:06,173 --> 02:34:08,334
[SPEAKER_06]: 25 and 30 even makes it a little bit better.

2218
02:34:08,374 --> 02:34:09,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheaper than that would be great.

2219
02:34:10,014 --> 02:34:13,575
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm seriously hoping that all three do not come out at 50 bucks a piece.

2220
02:34:13,795 --> 02:34:19,876
[SPEAKER_09]: But if one does multiplayer, I mean, there's a bunch of people that only play StarCraft for multiplayer.

2221
02:34:20,197 --> 02:34:21,297
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the hell with single player.

2222
02:34:21,577 --> 02:34:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, this is the funny thing.

2223
02:34:23,837 --> 02:34:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of months ago, I finally got StarCraft to work on OSX.

2224
02:34:27,918 --> 02:34:29,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a MacBook Pro, by the way.

2225
02:34:30,059 --> 02:34:33,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I finally got StarCraft to work on my Mac.

2226
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:35,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been playing through it.

2227
02:34:35,587 --> 02:34:37,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been playing the campaign and nothing else.

2228
02:34:38,951 --> 02:34:41,674
[SPEAKER_06]: The real rub is I'm playing it without cheats because I've never done that.

2229
02:34:42,254 --> 02:34:45,217
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm playing through the campaigns and nothing else.

2230
02:34:45,658 --> 02:34:48,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially now that StarCraft 2 is coming out, I want to keep doing that.

2231
02:34:51,664 --> 02:34:58,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And all three of the races, I don't prefer the Terrans, but that doesn't mean I don't want to play their campaigns.

2232
02:34:58,516 --> 02:35:01,638
[SPEAKER_06]: The story in the first one was magnificent.

2233
02:35:01,999 --> 02:35:04,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to play that the whole way through.

2234
02:35:04,961 --> 02:35:07,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably multiple times based off what I'm hearing they're doing.

2235
02:35:07,823 --> 02:35:10,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very curious to see, because Blizzard's pretty in tune with their fanbase.

2236
02:35:10,845 --> 02:35:13,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very curious to see how they kind of respond to the negativity.

2237
02:35:13,607 --> 02:35:14,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know they will this week.

2238
02:35:14,908 --> 02:35:16,189
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a follow-up on this.

2239
02:35:16,410 --> 02:35:18,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really hoping that they do it for cheaper.

2240
02:35:18,251 --> 02:35:20,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it would make sense, and they're very good at that.

2241
02:35:21,794 --> 02:35:22,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2242
02:35:22,234 --> 02:35:24,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Jason, we've got to wrap up and get the show on out of here.

2243
02:35:24,696 --> 02:35:26,077
[SPEAKER_09]: But do you have any last thoughts?

2244
02:35:26,772 --> 02:35:31,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Your Netflix achievement was hilarious, and I want to see it happen.

2245
02:35:32,199 --> 02:35:32,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2246
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:35,223
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have no idea what we're talking about, you'll have to listen to Bobby's show.

2247
02:35:35,423 --> 02:35:36,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a plug for Bobby.

2248
02:35:37,186 --> 02:35:37,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it.

2249
02:35:37,887 --> 02:35:39,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Allgames.com, iTunes, podcast.

2250
02:35:41,081 --> 02:35:43,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And while you're there, leave us a nice review too.

2251
02:35:43,343 --> 02:35:54,554
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I gotta say, speaking of the iTunes reviews, and if you don't already know, you can leave reviews on iTunes and it really helps in the ranking of the show and it gets it a little higher in the list the more people find us.

2252
02:35:54,574 --> 02:36:00,200
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a really awesome review left this week and I want to at least try to acknowledge people that leave reviews.

2253
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:01,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was Let's Have Tea.

2254
02:36:02,642 --> 02:36:08,666
[SPEAKER_09]: It just says Let's Have, and then it's cut off, but I'm almost positive that's the only name I've seen around is Let's Have Tea that would fit.

2255
02:36:09,027 --> 02:36:15,251
[SPEAKER_09]: And they say, I've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for a few years now, and still today I've yet to find a podcast that has nearly the same feel as OLR does.

2256
02:36:15,631 --> 02:36:19,494
[SPEAKER_09]: After a few episodes, you'll begin to feel like these people are your friends rather than your entertainers.

2257
02:36:19,794 --> 02:36:23,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Half of that is because the show is made up of three people who are good friends outside the show.

2258
02:36:24,457 --> 02:36:26,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww, doesn't that give you warm fuzzies all over?

2259
02:36:26,679 --> 02:36:27,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Make you a little nauseous?

2260
02:36:27,579 --> 02:36:27,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Aww.

2261
02:36:28,240 --> 02:36:28,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww.

2262
02:36:28,860 --> 02:36:29,421
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyway, sorry.

2263
02:36:30,361 --> 02:36:32,042
[SPEAKER_09]: We love the positive reviews.

2264
02:36:33,543 --> 02:36:36,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Jason, we've got to let you go to wrap up, okay?

2265
02:36:39,047 --> 02:36:39,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

2266
02:36:39,627 --> 02:36:40,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you can hear me.

2267
02:36:40,628 --> 02:36:41,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, see ya!

2268
02:36:42,089 --> 02:36:43,430
[SPEAKER_09]: That was kind of an awkward end.

2269
02:36:44,771 --> 02:36:45,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2270
02:36:46,051 --> 02:36:46,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2271
02:36:46,512 --> 02:36:50,254
[SPEAKER_09]: TheRobD says, gives you warm fuzzies until someone's outside your door asking to hang out.

2272
02:36:50,514 --> 02:36:55,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's why we always say that, hey, we're based out of Sacramento, but that's about all we tell you.

2273
02:36:55,538 --> 02:36:55,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2274
02:36:57,500 --> 02:36:59,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big place, over a million people.

2275
02:36:59,661 --> 02:37:01,903
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyhow, hey, we've got to wrap up the show.

2276
02:37:02,023 --> 02:37:02,863
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that time.

2277
02:37:03,364 --> 02:37:05,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Before we wrap up, though, some quick last-minute stories.

2278
02:37:05,905 --> 02:37:06,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually want to start tonight.

2279
02:37:06,886 --> 02:37:08,947
[SPEAKER_09]: TigerClaw sent me this link, and I thought it was pretty funny.

2280
02:37:09,487 --> 02:37:11,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft is suing DHL.

2281
02:37:11,108 --> 02:37:12,009
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who DHL is?

2282
02:37:12,029 --> 02:37:15,171
[SPEAKER_09]: They're kind of like FedEx, UPS, but they're like number three, I think.

2283
02:37:15,371 --> 02:37:16,372
[SPEAKER_09]: But they hire convicts.

2284
02:37:16,732 --> 02:37:17,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

2285
02:37:17,512 --> 02:37:21,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apparently it's come to a head there because DHL lost 21,600 Xbox consoles.

2286
02:37:23,696 --> 02:37:24,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn!

2287
02:37:24,216 --> 02:37:24,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

2288
02:37:25,037 --> 02:37:26,417
[SPEAKER_09]: A train derailed in Texas.

2289
02:37:26,978 --> 02:37:30,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So because of the train derailment... Derailed right into my garage!

2290
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:32,460
[SPEAKER_09]: This is everything.

2291
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:34,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, this is coming from a lawsuit.

2292
02:37:34,401 --> 02:37:35,742
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been filed in Seattle, of course.

2293
02:37:35,762 --> 02:37:36,622
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where Microsoft's based.

2294
02:37:37,182 --> 02:37:39,464
[SPEAKER_09]: $2 million in damages from DHL is what they want.

2295
02:37:39,524 --> 02:37:44,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because of two containers of Xbox consoles that had impact damage, wetting, pilfering, and storage.

2296
02:37:45,326 --> 02:37:47,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And the train derailed around Duke, Texas.

2297
02:37:47,327 --> 02:37:49,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So suddenly there's tons of Xbox users in Texas.

2298
02:37:49,468 --> 02:37:50,829
[SPEAKER_09]: If only it were Duke Nukem, Texas.

2299
02:37:51,169 --> 02:37:53,610
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, this happened on October 13th, 2007.

2300
02:37:54,150 --> 02:37:58,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was quite some time ago, but the legal stuff is slow right now.

2301
02:37:58,753 --> 02:37:59,773
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you have it.

2302
02:38:00,594 --> 02:38:03,495
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, usually you would just go, well, it's an accident.

2303
02:38:03,515 --> 02:38:04,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are they being so mean?

2304
02:38:04,455 --> 02:38:15,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope, they are saying in the lawsuit that a DHL has not compensated it for the loss and that the delivery service, again, according to the lawsuit, quote, negligently breached it.

2305
02:38:15,761 --> 02:38:16,741
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I'm not real radio.

2306
02:38:17,001 --> 02:38:20,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Breached its duties as a common carrier, handler, bailee,

2307
02:38:21,103 --> 02:38:34,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Warehouseman, Agent, or in its other capabilities so they're basically saying you done fucked up and ruined all our Xboxes because of it and so that's why they were so short on Xboxes a year ago there you have it anyhow

2308
02:38:35,943 --> 02:38:40,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob D speaks up in chat and says, someone wet on two containers of 360 controllers?

2309
02:38:41,265 --> 02:38:43,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep those 360s out of the bathroom.

2310
02:38:43,426 --> 02:38:44,586
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew that was a bad idea.

2311
02:38:45,106 --> 02:38:49,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when they fell out of the train, they got in the rain in Spain on the plane.

2312
02:38:50,828 --> 02:38:52,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any last-minute stories, Loki?

2313
02:38:53,009 --> 02:38:53,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do, actually.

2314
02:38:53,849 --> 02:38:54,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, what's up?

2315
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:57,731
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, a bunch of interesting stuff.

2316
02:38:58,905 --> 02:39:03,489
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, X and A games are showing up on Xbox Live, apparently now.

2317
02:39:03,729 --> 02:39:07,372
[SPEAKER_07]: I have yet to go actually check this out, but apparently they started launching them.

2318
02:39:07,492 --> 02:39:09,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what the last update was, remember?

2319
02:39:09,373 --> 02:39:13,917
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a live down for a day or so, and they were tweaking some shit.

2320
02:39:15,117 --> 02:39:19,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, apparently there are some errors popping up right now, but it says...

2321
02:39:19,721 --> 02:39:22,822
[SPEAKER_07]: There's two titles that seem to be unplayable to average users.

2322
02:39:23,383 --> 02:39:28,485
[SPEAKER_07]: With XNA Creators Club launcher errors popping up even if you have the program installed.

2323
02:39:28,985 --> 02:39:31,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, so maybe it's something coming.

2324
02:39:31,987 --> 02:39:36,629
[SPEAKER_07]: But apparently they had both a free demo and the full version is priced at 100 Microsoft points.

2325
02:39:38,309 --> 02:39:40,250
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 Microsoft points ain't a lot.

2326
02:39:41,231 --> 02:39:46,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Shown at Tokyo Game Show, Nobi Nobi Boy, which has the most...

2327
02:39:47,728 --> 02:39:49,790
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2328
02:40:10,530 --> 02:40:19,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Left 4 Dead, the demo has been confirmed to be coming out early November, so that'll be fun to check out on the Xbox 360 and PC.

2329
02:40:20,716 --> 02:40:27,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, another demo that's been kind of confirmed, Mirror's Edge, apparently coming November 6th.

2330
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:37,327
[SPEAKER_07]: This has actually been revealed via GameStop's website, because on their little bonus offer thing there, it says, special note, Mirror's Edge demo will be available for download November 6th.

2331
02:40:38,267 --> 02:40:38,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, interesting.

2332
02:40:40,893 --> 02:40:45,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of Xbox Live Arcade games announced at Tokyo Game Show.

2333
02:40:45,555 --> 02:40:47,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots and lots and lots of stuff.

02:40:47,496 --> 02:40:48,177
[SPEAKER_07]: King of Fighters 98.

2335
02:40:48,577 --> 02:40:52,959
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a brand new Arkanoid game coming to...

2336
02:40:54,517 --> 02:40:55,698
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2337
02:41:11,707 --> 02:41:13,627
[SPEAKER_07]: R-Type 1 and 2 Other games coming out...

2338
02:41:36,025 --> 02:41:53,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Dodon Pachi and I guess that came out in Japan only but I don't even know if that's an Xbox Live arcade game but they have some screens for the new R-Type game looks awesome awesome awesome and let's see I know I've got a lot more here sorry

2339
02:41:56,181 --> 02:42:02,683
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a new t-shirt that was shown at Tokyo Game Show for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

2340
02:42:03,984 --> 02:42:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty cool.

2341
02:42:04,444 --> 02:42:05,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Jimmy would like that.

2342
02:42:06,385 --> 02:42:09,126
[SPEAKER_07]: And what was I going to say here?

2343
02:42:11,238 --> 02:42:13,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave Rob a video for this.

2344
02:42:13,519 --> 02:42:17,922
[SPEAKER_07]: They announced... Remember that Rock Band reality show?

2345
02:42:18,482 --> 02:42:24,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, apparently Rock Band 2 The Stars will be premiering on VH1 Classic this month.

2346
02:42:25,325 --> 02:42:27,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a little promo video for it.

2347
02:42:28,689 --> 02:42:35,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really sure what it is, but it says, On October 15th, VH1 Classic will premiere a new reality show called Rock Band to the Stars.

2348
02:42:35,511 --> 02:42:47,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It will feature Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach as they play hosts to 12 wannabe rockers as they live in a mansion competing in different Rock Band 2 competitions.

2349
02:42:48,195 --> 02:42:49,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you go, courtesy of EW.com.

2350
02:42:50,489 --> 02:42:52,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Rock Band to the Stars.

2351
02:42:52,650 --> 02:42:54,171
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about Rock Band 2.

2352
02:42:54,211 --> 02:43:03,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Two legendary frontmen, Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper, will choose their ultimate rock band bands from a pool of 15 rabid rock band masters.

2353
02:43:03,355 --> 02:43:03,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow!

2354
02:43:05,282 --> 02:43:18,508
[SPEAKER_01]: each week the players will face grueling challenges and painful eliminations oh my god to find out who rules in all things Rock Band 2 Rock Band to the Stars premieres this Wednesday during Jumpstart Videos are you ready to rock?

2355
02:43:18,688 --> 02:43:26,811
[SPEAKER_09]: only on VH1 looks a little silly looks very low budget very very low budget what does TV come to?

2356
02:43:28,912 --> 02:43:31,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know I get it, it's a little play on words there

2357
02:43:31,894 --> 02:43:37,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, another funny thing, you know how they have in-game advertising for different things?

2358
02:43:38,598 --> 02:43:39,559
[SPEAKER_07]: EA has a lot of it.

2359
02:43:39,739 --> 02:43:45,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Burnout Paradise apparently has Barack Obama banners now on their billboards.

2360
02:43:46,823 --> 02:43:48,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting advertising, by the way.

2361
02:43:51,583 --> 02:43:54,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently there's a rumor that IGN let slip a new Wii channel.

2362
02:43:54,784 --> 02:43:56,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we may have talked about this briefly last week.

2363
02:43:57,005 --> 02:43:59,046
[SPEAKER_07]: You know how there was that Band Brothers DX channel?

2364
02:43:59,086 --> 02:44:04,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're saying that maybe there's a new channel coming out for Guitar Hero to use your DS on the Wii.

2365
02:44:04,248 --> 02:44:06,388
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of similar to that, but with Guitar Hero.

2366
02:44:07,069 --> 02:44:07,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

2367
02:44:07,689 --> 02:44:09,209
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of cool.

2368
02:44:09,450 --> 02:44:11,850
[SPEAKER_07]: And then... Let's see here.

2369
02:44:12,651 --> 02:44:17,512
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I thought would be funny to mention, Rob, there's a video advertising...

2370
02:44:19,833 --> 02:44:20,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Dukapon Kingdom.

2371
02:44:21,514 --> 02:44:27,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one thing that they do show advertised on there is they named their character Sassy Pants.

2372
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:28,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome!

2373
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:29,301
[SPEAKER_09]: What game was this?

2374
02:44:29,761 --> 02:44:30,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Dukapon Kingdom.

2375
02:44:30,982 --> 02:44:31,763
[SPEAKER_09]: They took it from me.

2376
02:44:32,143 --> 02:44:33,384
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my WoW character name, by the way.

2377
02:44:33,504 --> 02:44:35,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Sassy Pants.

2378
02:44:35,666 --> 02:44:36,607
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

2379
02:44:38,137 --> 02:44:40,478
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, anything in your neck of the woods?

2380
02:44:40,898 --> 02:44:41,058
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2381
02:44:41,598 --> 02:44:41,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2382
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:43,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we just got this in.

2383
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:45,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Late breaking news.

2384
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:49,522
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of a follow-up to the whole DHL and Microsoft thing going on.

2385
02:44:49,842 --> 02:44:54,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, DHL has released its defense as to why all the Xboxes got wet.

2386
02:45:19,261 --> 02:45:20,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on, Microsoft.

2387
02:45:24,945 --> 02:45:26,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't put the blame on us, Microsoft.

2388
02:45:27,847 --> 02:45:30,369
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we got out the hose.

2389
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:34,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't they just own up to it, okay?

2390
02:45:35,472 --> 02:45:37,034
[SPEAKER_11]: No, this is so stupid.

2391
02:45:38,759 --> 02:45:43,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't give a shit whatever their fucking reason is.

2392
02:45:46,722 --> 02:45:51,204
[SPEAKER_11]: While it's in their hands, it's in their care, therefore their responsibility.

2393
02:45:51,484 --> 02:45:52,444
[SPEAKER_11]: You fucking own up.

2394
02:45:53,665 --> 02:45:54,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

2395
02:45:57,286 --> 02:45:59,427
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what Microsoft would say to you, DarkSakra?

2396
02:46:01,028 --> 02:46:02,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Girl, you know it's true.

2397
02:46:04,749 --> 02:46:06,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, ooh, ooh.

2398
02:46:09,164 --> 02:46:09,504
[SPEAKER_09]: PeanutButter

2399
02:46:28,493 --> 02:46:30,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
