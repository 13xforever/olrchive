1
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:16,073
[SPEAKER_07]: and I, October 19th, 2008.

2
00:00:16,213 --> 00:00:18,598
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet generates some big controversy.

3
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:22,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Download content comes to Soul Calibur 4 that will surprise no one.

4
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:25,532
[SPEAKER_07]: And could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 soon be re-released?

5
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:35,435
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:38,276
[SPEAKER_12]: We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:44,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And over the next three hours we'll be talking about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

8
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:50,280
[SPEAKER_12]: And with you for the next few hours is myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,541
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?

11
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:53,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Annoyed of the world.

12
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:54,481
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is that?

13
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:55,401
[SPEAKER_04]: People suck.

14
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:56,562
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry to hear that.

15
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:59,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, I guess we'll have some good rants tonight.

16
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:00,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Mmm.

17
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:01,103
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

18
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:01,523
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

19
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:02,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Careful, chat.

20
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:03,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Specific people suck.

21
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:04,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, boy.

22
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,525
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't me.

23
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:06,345
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't do it, did I?

24
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:06,625
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

25
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:07,465
[SPEAKER_12]: You love me, right?

26
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:08,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It's groups of people.

27
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:09,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

28
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:10,106
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

29
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:11,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we'll see.

30
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:14,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we'll catch on a little bit about what's going on a little later.

31
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,788
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't feel better about it by then.

32
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:16,629
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

33
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:17,349
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, say hello to the one and only Loki.

35
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

36
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,391
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you, Tech Master?

37
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:22,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki?

38
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:23,371
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm fine.

39
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,051
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a good week?

40
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:24,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

41
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you mad at certain groups of people, too?

42
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:27,072
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

43
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:29,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

44
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:31,375
[SPEAKER_12]: You're perpetually mad at somebody.

45
00:01:31,415 --> 00:01:31,935
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm just kidding.

46
00:01:57,692 --> 00:01:59,973
[SPEAKER_12]: on this lovely Sunday evening as we always do when we tape live.

47
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:01,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's start off.

48
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,114
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

49
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,434
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Rock Band 2 and Ragnarok Online.

50
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:07,055
[SPEAKER_12]: How was Rock Band 2?

51
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:08,615
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very good.

52
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:10,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah?

53
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:13,497
[SPEAKER_12]: What is your instrument of preference in Rock Band 2?

54
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have one.

55
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:16,858
[SPEAKER_12]: You like to play a little bit of everything?

56
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:18,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't prefer to play.

57
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:20,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you like to watch?

58
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

59
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:25,360
[SPEAKER_04]: My shoulder hurt and I was in a lot of pain so they made me play based on a song.

60
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:26,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Gotcha.

61
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:28,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, hey.

62
00:02:28,825 --> 00:02:30,506
[SPEAKER_12]: How did you like it compared to the first one?

63
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all no different.

64
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:34,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more rock band.

65
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,169
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, more.

66
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

67
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,291
[SPEAKER_04]: More songs.

68
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:44,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that was okay, but, you know, I wasn't, it wasn't anything to be impressed or displeased over.

69
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:45,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just more rock band.

70
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:47,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

71
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if there's nothing else, then we'll move on to Loki.

72
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:50,238
[SPEAKER_12]: How was your gaming week?

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the clothes in it suck.

74
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,460
Hahaha.

75
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Better Barbie mode in the first game.

76
00:02:57,614 --> 00:02:58,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

77
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:03,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they actually still have some of the same clothes from the first game and the second game.

78
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:04,618
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't really add that much.

79
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,519
[SPEAKER_04]: The gore outfits were kind of neat.

80
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:13,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see, this week I played Saints Row 2, actually.

81
00:03:13,303 --> 00:03:17,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I'm about almost 50% done with the game.

82
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:20,767
[SPEAKER_13]: It says I'm only like 37% or maybe it's 47% done.

83
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:21,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

84
00:03:24,403 --> 00:03:26,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, I've gone through two of the gangs already.

85
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I've finished the Brotherhood and the Son of Samidi.

86
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:33,805
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a weird gang.

87
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, now I'm starting to run in a little bit.

88
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:38,605
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

89
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:39,366
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty cool.

90
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:45,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I still think, though, out of the three gangs so far, the Brotherhood have been... I think that storyline was the most brutal that was in it.

91
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I played a little bit of the multiplayer.

92
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:51,648
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually have a game mode that's pretty awesome.

93
00:03:51,668 --> 00:03:52,608
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of mixes up...

94
00:03:53,448 --> 00:03:54,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

96
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:47,187
[SPEAKER_13]: All along, while this is going on, there's also different tags you can spray paint to give your teams different abilities.

97
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:55,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Like double damage or double money for killing other gang members or a smoke screen.

98
00:04:56,033 --> 00:04:57,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Stuff like that.

99
00:04:58,054 --> 00:05:00,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Really cool gameplay.

100
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:03,058
[SPEAKER_13]: The actual deathmatch mode is pretty fun.

101
00:05:03,778 --> 00:05:06,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the shopping mall level that they have.

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,101
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of fun to play around in.

103
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:12,469
[SPEAKER_13]: What else did I play?

104
00:05:12,489 --> 00:05:16,451
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a random off-the-wall question for you about Saints Row 2.

105
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:19,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we have a news story coming up later on about some of the controversy this game is generating.

106
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:28,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Which game do you think is more violent and has more potential for controversy, this game or Grand Theft Auto, seeing as they're very similar and appeal to the same audience?

107
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:45,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, maybe this game a little bit, because they don't really get into, I mean, there's corrupt police in Grand Theft Auto 4, um, in this game you can actually dress up or impersonate a cop in this, like, fictional cops type show, um, called, uh, I forget what it was called now, um...

108
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, The Fuzz, that's what the show's called.

109
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:59,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And you basically go around beating up people dressed up as cops while they're filming it and stuff.

110
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:00,299
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's one of the activities.

111
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Plus, there's a level where you break into a police station and do a bunch of stuff like that.

112
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:11,105
[SPEAKER_13]: If anything, I'd say Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, I think, was more...

113
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:13,828
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand Theft Auto 4

115
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:58,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not surprised.

116
00:06:58,136 --> 00:07:06,101
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm the developers of Saints Row 2 and the people behind this game, I know one of the best ways I'm going to get at and get close to that number is to one-up the controversy they're doing.

117
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,982
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's half the reason why Grand Theft Auto sells.

118
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:12,404
[SPEAKER_13]: People need to understand it's fiction.

119
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:17,526
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like I go and go shoot the cops in the game because I wish I could go shoot real cops.

120
00:07:17,586 --> 00:07:19,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's not what happens.

121
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:20,608
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the opposition.

122
00:07:20,668 --> 00:07:24,370
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be Nazis running this entire city and it doesn't matter.

123
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,551
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

124
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:52,368
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Fable 2.

125
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was an actual movie coming out, and it was a Fable 2 commercial.

126
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:56,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

127
00:07:58,074 --> 00:08:01,275
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, games are getting... They've come a long way since combat.

128
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:02,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's put it that way.

129
00:08:02,735 --> 00:08:08,576
[SPEAKER_13]: But, yeah, I mean, it's just if... Yeah, if you want to look at it like it's realistic or something like that, then yeah, okay, sure.

130
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:14,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's offensive to cops or something, but you have to understand games aren't meant to be a simulation for real life.

131
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:25,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, granted, you can make a game that's like a simulation of real life if you want, but then again, you can also make pure fiction that's just way over the top, which is what Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto are doing, you know,

132
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,081
[SPEAKER_13]: To an extent.

133
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:31,264
[SPEAKER_13]: And Grand Theft Auto is a little bit more grounded, but still, it's pretty over the top.

134
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:32,985
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

135
00:08:33,225 --> 00:08:37,028
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just... You can find controversy anywhere.

136
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:47,095
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other game I've played, which also has controversy involved with it, would be LittleBigPlanet.

137
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,617
[SPEAKER_13]: And LittleBigPlanet is amazing.

138
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,459
[SPEAKER_13]: That's easy to say.

139
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,421
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just an amazing game.

140
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:56,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

141
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,238
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

142
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:39,585
[SPEAKER_13]: They're characters of different sections of the world.

143
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:45,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So the African level is all like, think Lion King, basically.

144
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:52,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas the British levels are all knights in castles and that kind of thing.

145
00:09:53,196 --> 00:10:00,182
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a little bit racist, but in the way that it's a small world is racist, where no one's going to possibly be offended because it's so damn cute.

146
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:01,383
[SPEAKER_12]: It's incredibly cute.

147
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:01,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?

148
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Game of the Year?

149
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:03,705
[SPEAKER_13]: Game of the Year?

150
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,174
[SPEAKER_13]: It could definitely be a contender for Game of the Year.

151
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything else in your gaming week this week?

152
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Um... No.

153
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:48,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate to take it back to Saints Row because you talk about that game an awful lot, but a good question from chatroom at chat.orangeonlinesradio.com First chat comment of the night goes to Seymour Booty.

154
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:53,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Since you guys are talking about Saints Row 2, are you having any problems with crashing or freezing in the game?

155
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:56,109
[SPEAKER_12]: It crashes my system every time I try to save manually.

156
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Um... Not really.

157
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had it lock up a few times.

158
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:00,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

159
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:02,550
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's just random.

160
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,850
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just like any other game.

161
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:13,537
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't really had any problems saving manually because I do it all the time just in case I want to quit or something at that time.

162
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,380
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not really any problems with it.

163
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:19,382
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:35,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Starfall PvP Typhoon

165
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:54,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

166
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,500
[SPEAKER_12]: We went back to Ubers and the old WoW content and got ourselves the Jenkins title.

167
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:22,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you can now, you know, WoW has this funny way of working in pop culture references about WoW into WoW.

168
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:29,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And this whole Leroy Jenkins thing is now Leroy is an achievement and if you get that achievement you can have Jenkins as your title.

169
00:12:29,544 --> 00:12:34,505
[SPEAKER_12]: So that you're like, you know, if your character name is, you know, Sky, you would be Sky Jenkins.

170
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:35,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is kind of funny.

171
00:12:36,746 --> 00:12:37,206
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:48,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Other than Warcraft and experiencing the new patch, I actually took a trip, and you folks that have been listening to the show for a long time since we were about music games will appreciate this, and you guys here in studio.

173
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,326
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to Milpitas Golf Land this week.

174
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to good old Miggle.

175
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:56,869
[SPEAKER_12]: It's changed a lot since, you know, I hadn't been there in quite a few years.

176
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:00,691
[SPEAKER_12]: Last time I was there, I think they still had Derby Owners Club, which is now at our Vigil.

177
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:06,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And at Milpitas Golf Land, you know, you have to remember, this is like the holy land of...

178
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:15,318
[SPEAKER_12]: of Beatmania and the Babani in, you know, between Milpitas and Sunnyvale Golf Land, you know, these were, I guess you could say Arcade Infinity to an extent, too.

179
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:17,800
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like the trinity of California.

180
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Northern California.

181
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Arcade Infinity is southern, technically, but you know what I mean, though.

182
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:26,684
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like one of the west coast hubs of where DDR got big.

183
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:29,966
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's interesting to see, you know how Milpitas...

184
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:57,056
[SPEAKER_12]: used to have DDR in one of the rooms that room it's it's like two rooms you have to this arcade is like two separate buildings one building now is nothing but ticket games like I remember when we were first going there like half of it was ticket redemption it was slowly spreading well now it is nothing but ticket redemption in one room but it's interesting because they've turned the other room into you know like all the music games are on one one wall then all the driving games are over here and all the fighting games are over here so it's kind of like you have

185
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:59,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Just different little sections that was kind of interesting.

186
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:06,258
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did play... I played Midnight Maximum Tune 3 and I played Keyboard Mania even though it was sticking on the keyboard.

187
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:09,459
[SPEAKER_12]: But a new game I played, Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.

188
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:15,320
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been out this whole time and I have not yet played it in arcades and it was really the same damn thing as the last game.

189
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,320
[SPEAKER_12]: There wasn't much difference.

190
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Just some new songs.

191
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Yippee!

192
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:20,561
[SPEAKER_12]: And some little flashy graphics when you get combos.

193
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:20,761
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

194
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:21,621
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot to let you know.

195
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:24,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this is totally local news, but...

196
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:31,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember that one store that we went to that's right there by the Folsom Theater, the Gamer's Empire or whatever?

197
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,688
[SPEAKER_13]: They got a Supernova machine now.

198
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:37,550
[SPEAKER_12]: It's untouched, basically.

199
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:39,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this is the other thing that surprised me.

200
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Miggle is selling their DDR Extreme machine.

201
00:14:42,193 --> 00:14:43,794
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a little sign on it that says for sale.

202
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:48,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Guess how much they want for this Miggle DDR Extreme machine as is.

203
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:48,497
$12,000.

204
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:50,879
[SPEAKER_12]: No, a little high.

205
00:14:51,219 --> 00:14:51,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Very high, in fact.

206
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:51,920
$8,000.

207
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,301
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a used machine.

208
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:55,102
[SPEAKER_12]: No, much higher.

209
00:14:56,483 --> 00:14:56,743
[SPEAKER_12]: 8,000 dollars.

210
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:57,684
[SPEAKER_12]: A little lower.

211
00:14:58,884 --> 00:14:59,105
[SPEAKER_13]: 7,000 dollars.

212
00:14:59,145 --> 00:14:59,805
[SPEAKER_12]: A little lower than that.

213
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,546
[SPEAKER_12]: 6,000 dollars.

214
00:15:01,566 --> 00:15:02,807
[SPEAKER_12]: 6,000 dollars is what they want for this machine.

215
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:04,228
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not bad.

216
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:04,768
[SPEAKER_12]: 5,999 to be exact.

217
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

218
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,471
[SPEAKER_13]: You can take the machine, retrofit it, and upgrade it, I mean.

219
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,492
[SPEAKER_12]: That's always interesting.

220
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:11,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

221
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:11,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that was it.

222
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:16,596
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I actually played miniature golf, which in all the times I've ever been to Milpitas Golf Line, I never have played miniature golf there.

223
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:17,377
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did this time.

224
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:18,858
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

225
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:46,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Miniature Golf the real game um that's it not a lot of whole other console games i've been playing just you know experiencing wow this week and you know some of the same old console stuff i've been playing like rock band and all that good stuff all right let's get into uh some housekeeping real quick it is episode number 299 tonight which means next week is episode number 300 if you can believe it and uh what we want you guys to do is we want you to leave your messages for us we're going to play them during next week's commercial break um

226
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:50,659
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to say a few words about Orange Launch Radio, just try to keep it a minute or less.

227
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,441
[SPEAKER_12]: You can call the Skype line anytime when we're not live.

228
00:15:53,521 --> 00:16:06,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't call right now if you're listening live on Sunday night, but if you're listening to this in the podcast format, give 1-877-GAME-OLR a call and leave us a message about what you think about us making Episode 300, and we'll play it on the break next week.

229
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Otherwise, it's going to be a good old-fashioned show.

230
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:10,715
[SPEAKER_12]: You never know what kind of guests might show up.

231
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, we have some games planned for next week.

232
00:16:12,717 --> 00:16:13,337
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be a good time.

233
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:14,218
[SPEAKER_12]: There you have it.

234
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:19,573
[SPEAKER_12]: and something that... Loki has a huge surprise, we'll say that.

235
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:20,373
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll say that much.

236
00:16:20,433 --> 00:16:21,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki has a huge surprise.

237
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:25,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's see, what else do we have coming up?

238
00:16:26,614 --> 00:16:29,755
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've been listening to the show this year, you know I've had some medical issues going on.

239
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:34,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to be having surgery right after episode 300, so we probably won't be having a show the next week.

240
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,256
[SPEAKER_12]: So we might have a little bit of a break after episode 300.

241
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,897
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have more details on that next week.

242
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:39,497
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all.

243
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:40,697
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll talk about that.

244
00:16:41,497 --> 00:16:43,499
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't worry, the surgery is nothing major.

245
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:44,761
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gallbladder surgery.

246
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:45,902
[SPEAKER_12]: A million people have had it done.

247
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:46,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not that worried about it.

248
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I just kind of want to get it over with at this point.

249
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's it for housekeeping.

250
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:51,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Visit our MySpace.

251
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:52,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Visit our Facebook.

252
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:54,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Visit our LiveJournal, our Twitter.

253
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get into tonight's gaming news.

254
00:16:57,173 --> 00:16:57,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, start us off.

255
00:16:58,464 --> 00:17:04,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, anyways, so this is kind of interesting.

256
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:08,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, not too surprising because they haven't been doing well financially for a while now.

257
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:14,551
[SPEAKER_13]: But Infogrames has finally now finished purchasing Atari.

258
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:19,074
[SPEAKER_13]: They made an $11 million stock purchase.

259
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,832
[SPEAKER_13]: of Atari, and previously they had owned 51.4%.

260
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:32,957
[SPEAKER_13]: But now they are done with the purchase, and we'll see where they take it.

261
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:39,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully in the right direction, and not, I don't know, into the red again.

262
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:46,004
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the same company that brought us the Epic 2600 in My How Times Have Changed, right?

263
00:17:46,504 --> 00:17:47,925
[SPEAKER_12]: This is kind of, I don't know, kind of

264
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:58,004
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of sad in a way, but you kind of saw it coming because what has Atari done in the past five years that's been really huge, besides maybe their flashback consoles, which are really cool, actually.

265
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Dragon Ball Z?

266
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:04,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, all right, but I don't know.

267
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:05,706
[SPEAKER_12]: In a way, it's kind of the end of an era.

268
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:06,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Era?

269
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:07,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Did I say error?

270
00:18:07,926 --> 00:18:08,647
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm thinking of something else.

271
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:10,247
[SPEAKER_12]: No, the end of an era, you know what I mean?

272
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:14,448
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's kind of sad, but there you go.

273
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:19,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, LittleBigPlanet has been stirring up a lot of talk this week.

274
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:25,010
[SPEAKER_12]: And one thing that's got people talking about LittleBigPlanet is the new license agreement that Sony has.

275
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony actually recently changed the PlayStation Network terms of use.

276
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:43,297
[SPEAKER_12]: And basically, to make a long story short, Sony says now in the user license agreement, you also authorize us and our affiliated companies without payment to you to license, sell, and otherwise commercially exploit your user material.

277
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:45,547
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you don't like it, don't use it.

278
00:18:45,747 --> 00:19:00,112
[SPEAKER_12]: If you create a little big planet level in the game and Sony decides they're going to sell it on a compilation later on, like maybe a best of for people that don't have online access, as I could possibly see forthcoming, depending on how big this game is, too bad, you're not getting any money for it.

279
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,813
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you don't like it, don't play the game.

280
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,354
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I like how they actually have exploit in there.

281
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:07,975
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an interesting word.

282
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:09,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll rape your mother.

283
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:10,796
What?

284
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

285
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:13,357
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that'll be a little big planet level.

286
00:19:14,506 --> 00:19:16,287
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be.

287
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,327
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of not surprising.

288
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:25,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of people are looking at this and say, oh my gosh, Sony is so big, bad, and evil corporate, but is it really that surprising in a way?

289
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,350
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

290
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:26,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Not really.

291
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:32,131
[SPEAKER_13]: I would hope that they still give you credit for it at least or say, hey, it's going to be in here.

292
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,332
[SPEAKER_13]: At least they have a free copy of the game.

293
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:34,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit.

294
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:36,333
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the least they could do.

295
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:39,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, a lot of people would probably be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put it in there.

296
00:19:39,574 --> 00:19:40,754
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't think they would.

297
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:45,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I would be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put that in there, just give me credit.

298
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:48,123
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you don't like it, you don't like it, don't use it.

299
00:19:49,243 --> 00:19:51,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't play the game, I guess.

300
00:19:51,304 --> 00:19:58,306
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know, if you were really expecting to profit off LittleBigPlanet, I think you might be playing the game for the wrong reasons, right?

301
00:19:59,146 --> 00:19:59,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

302
00:19:59,646 --> 00:19:59,946
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

303
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:07,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, we'll see how Sony plans to exploit user-created levels pretty soon.

304
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:14,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, moving on to... I don't know if this... Well, exploitation just really isn't the best word for this.

305
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:19,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it hypocrisy, but, you know, as we discussed with Bobby earlier, speaking of which...

306
00:20:22,168 --> 00:20:39,879
[SPEAKER_04]: This is LittleBigPlanet is being recalled because of religious content within the game and technically what it is is two expressions from the Koran have made it into the game by means of a song that was licensed to be in the game.

307
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,562
[SPEAKER_04]: that came out a few years ago.

308
00:20:44,504 --> 00:20:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And one person in the beta found it and apparently took offense to its presence and therefore wrote a letter to Sony, which I have right here, because I love pulling up, you know...

309
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: and archived content off of message boards after posts have been deleted for days.

310
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:12,857
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not even going to bother pronouncing any of the Arabic because I can't.

311
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:14,760
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll play the clip in a little bit.

312
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule

313
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:38,156
[SPEAKER_04]: When I listened carefully, I was surprised to hear some very familiar Arabic words from the Quran.

314
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,837
[SPEAKER_04]: You can listen to the track here, we'll play it in a second.

315
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:51,401
[SPEAKER_04]: The words are, in the 18th second, it's to translate, "...every soul shall have the taste of death," and to, almost immediately after, in the 27th second, "...all that is on earth will perish."

316
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:52,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late!

317
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:14,415
[SPEAKER_04]: We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our Holy Quran deeply offending.

318
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:22,321
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope you would remove the track from the game immediately via an online patch and make sure that all future shipments of the game do not contain it.

319
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:26,685
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd also like to mention this isn't the first time something like this has happened in video games.

320
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:36,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's 1998 hit Zelda Ocarina of Time contained a musical track with Islamic phrases and was removed in later shipments of the game after Nintendo was contacted by Muslim organizations.

321
00:22:37,454 --> 00:22:48,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year Capcom's Zack and Wiki and Activision's Call of Duty 4 also contained objectionable material offensive to Muslims that was spotted before the release of the final games and both companies thankfully removed the content.

322
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:55,629
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope that you act immediately to avoid any confusion and necessary controversy and we thank you for making such an amazing game.

323
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think the letter was very well worded.

324
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:04,111
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm going to go back and read a particular line from this, if I may.

325
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:09,512
[SPEAKER_04]: We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our Holy Quran deeply offending.

326
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:13,813
[SPEAKER_04]: So why aren't you offended at the artist that, you know, recorded the song in the first place?

327
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:19,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think that's just a little bit of hypocrisy right there?

328
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:25,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, shouldn't you actually take issue up with the songwriter, who, by the way, is Muslim, right?

329
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and the song has been out since 2006.

330
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, so why don't you do your homework first?

331
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:38,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and to be honest, I mean, who is this really offending?

332
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:41,806
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like, you know, death to America, woohoo!

333
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:44,167
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not, there's nothing like that.

334
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:48,069
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, most people are not going to know what it means.

335
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:51,251
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just going to hear it and they're going to say, hey, that sounds African.

336
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:53,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that fits with the level in the game.

337
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:56,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's what I heard, and that's what I thought.

338
00:23:56,164 --> 00:23:58,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, hell, this song is fucking awesome.

339
00:23:58,725 --> 00:24:05,828
[SPEAKER_12]: So to put this in context of the game of why this music would be here in the first place, like, you know, in the Africa level, you hear African-style music.

340
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,230
[SPEAKER_12]: In the South America level, you hear South American-style music.

341
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,111
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the, you know, in a level that's appropriate, you hear this music.

342
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:14,613
[SPEAKER_12]: It's world music, basically, as you're traveling different parts of the world.

343
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:21,876
[SPEAKER_12]: But somehow this slipped under the radar where, you know, people didn't realize that this could be offensive, even though the song's been out there for a while when nothing's said.

344
00:24:22,116 --> 00:24:25,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, keep in mind also, this is what I drew a parallel to.

345
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:31,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't Christian groups being offended at Rock Band 2 for having System of a Down in it?

346
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:32,184
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably are.

347
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:33,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Lines from the Bible.

348
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:34,446
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably are.

349
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:36,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did the game come out then with that song in it?

350
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:44,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably because Christian groups don't care because they have their own music with lines from the Bible and it's Christian rock and they're just like, hell yeah, spread the word.

351
00:24:44,514 --> 00:24:47,096
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the same equivalent is what I'm saying.

352
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:48,517
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just sorry, I mean...

353
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:57,627
[SPEAKER_13]: If I get pissed off, okay, if something I find offensive in a game and I write Sony a letter, they're going to be like, fuck off.

354
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:02,511
[SPEAKER_13]: If I say I'm Arab, then they're like, oh, oh, now we're going to listen to you.

355
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:03,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Double fucking standard.

356
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:04,093
[SPEAKER_13]: I disagree.

357
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:04,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree.

358
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:05,634
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely disagree.

359
00:25:05,654 --> 00:25:20,466
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually something that's going on in the country, especially over here, is that we're seeing people catering to different ethnic groups because of this whole perception of oppression that really should not exist in America in the modern world.

360
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:49,398
[SPEAKER_13]: I am going to put together a letter then to Sony and Media Monocle and I'm going to tell them how deeply offended I am that they are censoring the game I don't understand why if we offend one person I don't get why it's a big deal I actually do wonder how Sony would have reacted if the letter came that had absolutely no reference to the person sending it being Muslim or if they specifically said I am not Muslim, however

361
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Their reaction would have been different.

362
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,683
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a freaking double standard.

363
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:54,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

364
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:59,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to give some context to this, I'm going to play the clip from this game.

365
00:26:00,096 --> 00:26:01,356
[SPEAKER_12]: It's hit the gaming blog.

366
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:02,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody recorded it off their phone.

367
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:04,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to give credit where credit is due.

368
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:09,861
[SPEAKER_12]: We pulled this from Kotaku, where I believe one of their users got the sound clip and posted it on the site there.

369
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:12,003
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to play it.

370
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:17,186
[SPEAKER_12]: If you think for whatever reason this might offend you, I urge you to not listen to the next minute of the program.

371
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:23,469
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just want to give this some context so that our listeners can understand where the controversy might be springing from.

372
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,690
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to play the clip.

373
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:40,485
[SPEAKER_12]: So it definitely sets a certain type of world mood, right, this music?

374
00:26:40,505 --> 00:26:40,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

375
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:02,587
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's an awful lot of ignorant Americans out there that are not going to know anything that was just said.

376
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:04,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Not going to know any of that.

377
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:07,792
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just going to think, oh, it matches the movie.

378
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:12,597
[SPEAKER_04]: I know three words in Arabic and I couldn't say them off the top of my head.

379
00:27:13,518 --> 00:27:14,299
[SPEAKER_04]: So how was that?

380
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:30,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, I want to present a different opinion here, because I think, although I do see the overreaction going on here a little bit, and I think you're right, there are other religious things that are offensive that are in video games, I think in a way, Sony's doing us all a favor by pulling this game.

381
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:32,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it a little bit hypersensitive?

382
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:32,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

383
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,298
[SPEAKER_12]: But is it Sony's fault?

384
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:34,979
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

385
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Whose fault is it?

386
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,921
[SPEAKER_12]: The media's fault.

387
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:37,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Because...

388
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:56,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, if this had gone out and the wrong person had heard about it, and instead CNN, Al Jazeera, MSNBC gets a letter about this, then it's suddenly going to be all over the mainstream press that, oh my gosh, video games are teaching children passages from the Quran.

389
00:27:56,328 --> 00:27:56,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's over.

390
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,088
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean at that point?

391
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:05,111
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just another outrage of the violence in games and the messages that games are teaching us.

392
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:06,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Now it's religious text.

393
00:28:06,731 --> 00:28:09,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's going to say that it's not going to happen anyways?

394
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:17,943
[SPEAKER_13]: How about the people representing Mexico saying that they don't like the way that Mexicans are portrayed in this game?

395
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:20,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Or how about the way that South America is portrayed in this game?

396
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:25,491
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Sony sees smoke and they're trying to put out the fire before it spreads.

397
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:34,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of, and forgive me for going to a comedian on this one, but I kind of want to quote Carlos Mencia about talking about people being offended about the Taco Bell dog.

398
00:28:36,456 --> 00:28:42,880
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, the Taco Bell dog sends out messages for people that Mexicans are stupid.

399
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,101
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, no, it's sending out messages to buy more tacos.

400
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,283
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's people looking to be offended at something.

401
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:53,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It's people that are trying to find an excuse to...

402
00:28:54,993 --> 00:29:04,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do think it's people just trying to find some sort of excuse to put a little drama into their lives, to break up the monotony, instead of trying to just say, hey, it's in there.

403
00:29:05,518 --> 00:29:06,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

404
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,742
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're going to be offended at it being in the game, be offended at the person that recorded the song to begin with.

405
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,200
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

406
00:29:34,514 --> 00:29:56,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the mainstream media would have given a fuck I think they would have placed blame on the game and I think Sony is just trying to put out that fire it's sad but that's the world we live in it sucks but I agree with you that Sony is trying but I also do think that it would not have gotten as much attention from Sony had it not specifically said I and other Muslims are offended by this

407
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:08,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we do have that double standard that if you are some sort of oppressed group, and I say oppressed in quotes, that you automatically have to have someone throw you a bone.

408
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:09,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, that's not how it works.

409
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,663
[SPEAKER_13]: So was this dude like the only Muslim person playing this game, you know, in the beta or something?

410
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:15,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one person in the beta.

411
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:19,929
[SPEAKER_04]: He posted about it and found other people in his religious group that were equally offended.

412
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:20,910
[SPEAKER_13]: were they playing the game?

413
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,012
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a hard time believing he was the one and only Muslim in the beta.

414
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:24,793
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I just said.

415
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:28,737
[SPEAKER_04]: He was talking to other people in other forums like you said in his letter.

416
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:31,979
[SPEAKER_04]: To his credit, his letter was well worded and very respectful.

417
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,201
[SPEAKER_04]: That I do have to commend him on.

418
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:40,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And he wasn't asking for the game to be recalled and I don't think we're placing any of the blame on this guy at all for maybe bringing it to light.

419
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:41,147
[SPEAKER_04]: He even specifically said

420
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:44,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Future releases not contain it.

421
00:30:44,229 --> 00:30:47,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Patch the first releases, future printings, don't include it.

422
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:58,133
[SPEAKER_04]: That's acceptable, and that's part of what the beta is there for, to weed out offensive material, to weed out bugs, to make sure that you're releasing clean, safe content.

423
00:30:58,413 --> 00:30:58,733
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

424
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:23,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am going to, you know, like I said before, I don't know that Sony, I think he was right.

425
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,022
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who sent the letter was right to voice his concern.

426
00:31:27,082 --> 00:31:30,244
[SPEAKER_04]: If he felt like it was a big enough concern, he was right to voice it.

427
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:35,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what was one thing that I always say, nothing changes until you put forth the effort to make it change.

428
00:31:35,788 --> 00:31:36,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct?

429
00:31:36,568 --> 00:31:38,810
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, though, that the recall should be voluntary.

430
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:45,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if you are offended by it, then yes, they should give you the opportunity to send in your copy of the game so they don't have to hear that.

431
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:54,504
[SPEAKER_13]: But if a person like me, who thinks the song is pretty kick-ass and doesn't really care what it says, wants to keep it, then I don't see what the big deal is.

432
00:31:54,904 --> 00:32:08,119
[SPEAKER_13]: And see, that's part of what I... Because now they're oppressing me and my desire to have this song in the game for my own personal use, and they're oppressing me to benefit somebody else.

433
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:09,180
[SPEAKER_13]: That is my problem.

434
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,221
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a problem with...

435
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:11,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

436
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:30,818
[SPEAKER_04]: There's... It's pointless.

437
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,320
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wasting time and money.

438
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,161
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just put out a patch.

439
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:45,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should one... Because one group of people is offended by content that does not offend... Now, especially when the content is not attacking another group.

440
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:51,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if this was content that was saying, we hate all of so-and-such group, kill them all...

441
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:54,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, yes, it should be removed, don't you think?

442
00:32:55,239 --> 00:33:04,242
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's just something, not even a specific statement, just saying, oh, well, one day the earth is gone and all this stuff is going to happen.

443
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's just like reading Revelations, really.

444
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:15,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's nothing that's directed towards a party that anyone who is not in that faith would really get the reference to.

445
00:33:17,618 --> 00:33:19,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't think there's an easy answer to this.

446
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,801
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this whole story is just a reflection of the world we live in.

447
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:23,863
[SPEAKER_12]: People are just too fucking offended.

448
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:24,464
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

449
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:32,550
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, I'm sitting here thinking, it's live radio, and sometimes I'm giving a lot of these stories a lot of thought as we're sitting here talking about them.

450
00:33:32,571 --> 00:33:39,577
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm thinking, there's a story coming up later in the show in Part B where we're going to talk about something that's coming out in an upcoming game that kind of offends me a little bit.

451
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:53,762
[SPEAKER_12]: and although I can take offense I know how to be offended or whatever it's just kind of one of those things where even I look at some of the things that happen in video games and I go this is so stupid I wish games would kind of learn how to

452
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:57,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, address some of these things more appropriately.

453
00:33:57,383 --> 00:34:04,948
[SPEAKER_12]: In a way, I feel like a hypocrite kind of sitting here going, you know, well, everybody should just kind of learn to deal with it when I'm thinking about it.

454
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:08,210
[SPEAKER_12]: But come to think of it, there are some things in video games that offend me.

455
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:14,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think that you would get equal representation if you had emailed that company that makes that game?

456
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell to the no.

457
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:16,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

458
00:34:16,736 --> 00:34:18,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly my damn point.

459
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:21,759
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Redneck Rampage, okay?

460
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, while I personally...

461
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:26,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't consider myself to be a redneck.

462
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:35,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I do consider quite a number of my relatives to be purely... Jeff Foxworthy defines redneck as someone completely lacking in sophistication.

463
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:36,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

464
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,537
[SPEAKER_04]: That's most of my family.

465
00:34:39,158 --> 00:35:06,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Not my immediate, but aunts and uncles and cousins Anyway, so if I said I'm from Mobile, Alabama and I'm offended at this game or I'm offended at how you've portrayed this southern person in this game as being stupid just because they talk a little slower and have a thick accent that doesn't mean that their IQ is any lower than anybody else's I could say I'm offended at that or I could just laugh and go I'm related to people like that

466
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:08,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

467
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,190
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

468
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open.

469
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, what the hell?

470
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,031
[SPEAKER_12]: We're here.

471
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:27,671
[SPEAKER_12]: We do this show for a reason to talk about things.

472
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:33,272
[SPEAKER_12]: But the story I want to talk about later has to do with an upcoming game that just reinforces gay stereotypes I wish would go away.

473
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:38,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And as a gay man, it gets really old after a while seeing some of these gay stereotypes in games.

474
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:44,394
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just kind of sit here and go, God, I wish it would just fucking grow up some of these people that program the games.

475
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:51,455
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm thinking to myself, but at the same time, maybe there's people that are Arab that are sick of some of these stereotypes that are in the game about the...

476
00:35:52,995 --> 00:35:54,796
[SPEAKER_12]: The verses that are being said, I don't know.

477
00:35:55,076 --> 00:35:57,236
[SPEAKER_12]: In a way, I just don't want to be a hypocrite here.

478
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:58,236
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, that's the thing.

479
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,657
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a bit of difference between what you're discussing and what's going on.

480
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:08,019
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just... Well, at the same time, CNN would never run a story either on the fact that this other game comes out and offends gay people.

481
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:08,779
[SPEAKER_12]: That would never happen.

482
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:09,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Never happen.

483
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:11,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's stereotypes that a lot of people think about.

484
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:19,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It was going back to the massive double standard about what's considered bigotry and what's not, really.

485
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:23,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I was just saying in the chat room, racism is racism.

486
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

487
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,046
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought up an example.

488
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,587
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a diversity class at my work.

489
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:30,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Any corporation does diversity classes.

490
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:36,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And I brought a situation, and I think I've said it on the show, when I worked in Alabama at Aladdin's Castle,

491
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,411
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

492
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:28,111
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a street fighter machine right there and she shut up and walked away but you see what I mean racism is racism, bigotry is bigotry and as long as we perpetuate that type of thought and as long as we keep getting offended instead of just learning to roll a little bit with the punches give a little, take a little then what's going to happen we're breeding a different kind of intolerance don't you think?

493
00:37:28,578 --> 00:37:29,478
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a reasonable answer.

494
00:37:52,885 --> 00:37:59,833
[SPEAKER_12]: The question we asked our folks on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, did Sony overreact by recalling LittleBigPlanet due to the controversial music in the game?

495
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:00,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Why or why not?

496
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:06,841
[SPEAKER_12]: And here's some of the responses that we got on our Twitter, starting off with DarkTetsuya.

497
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:13,369
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know about lawsuit...

498
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:34,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not trying to prove all our listeners wrong, I'm sorry, but I just want to say, hey, look at this too.

499
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:39,287
[SPEAKER_12]: Geekboy2424 says, yes, nobody would have noticed if they wouldn't have mentioned it.

500
00:38:39,347 --> 00:38:41,528
[SPEAKER_12]: The person who heard this had to have scanned it.

501
00:38:42,168 --> 00:38:43,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he was a beta tester, right?

502
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:51,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, okay, not to mention that he's also probably very familiar with the Koran as well, because I don't know about you, but if someone quotes Bible verses to me...

503
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Wish!

504
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:52,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Wish!

505
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:52,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Wish!

506
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me read some of these other responses.

507
00:39:10,201 --> 00:39:16,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Mar and Marvel says, I think that it was overreacting a bit, but I can understand because of not wanting to offend people, especially in this so happy day and age.

508
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:20,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Dustoise says, wait, we have to please everyone and offend no one.

509
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,886
[SPEAKER_12]: We better stop the world now then.

510
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:22,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Big overreaction.

511
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:24,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Pete Garuno says, hell no.

512
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:26,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, fine, enough of that.

513
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,268
[SPEAKER_12]: To be honest, political correctness is going overboard.

514
00:39:28,308 --> 00:39:30,429
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems silly that nobody cared until launch.

515
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:36,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Gold Anthro says, yes, with the game being awaited for so long, just to remove it for something so small seems unnecessary.

516
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:40,956
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Tyrant says, no, it was something that needed to be removed and caught earlier.

517
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:43,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Not everyone is connected to the interwebs either.

518
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,683
[SPEAKER_12]: The Sag says, considering worldwide reactions to cartoons, absolutely not.

519
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:50,725
[SPEAKER_12]: Recalls are less expensive than riots.

520
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:51,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting point.

521
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:52,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting point.

522
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:57,409
[SPEAKER_12]: Decipher13 says, With people suing for less these days, Sony didn't overreact.

523
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Receiving the game at work and it being recalled in the same day was odd.

524
00:40:00,651 --> 00:40:01,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you have it.

525
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:05,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of our comments from the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.

526
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:08,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure this will go on for quite some time.

527
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:10,316
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm curious to see what kind of emails we get this week.

528
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:13,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

529
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:17,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I think this is a type of quandary to where there's no easy answer.

530
00:40:17,987 --> 00:40:25,752
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no easy solution because unfortunately there are people that will get offended and it could affect gaming's perception out there as a whole.

531
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:26,673
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just a shame.

532
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:27,914
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a shame.

533
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:43,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I really... My last two cents on it, really, is just I'm not looking forward to a world where no one can have any sort of free thought or opinion of their own without someone else trying to strike them down for being wrong.

534
00:40:44,913 --> 00:40:46,974
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thing is, I don't have a problem...

535
00:40:49,827 --> 00:40:50,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect!

536
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:50,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect solution!

537
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:22,992
[SPEAKER_12]: PS3 and PSP have received brand new firmware updates.

538
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:47,434
[SPEAKER_13]: The PS3 at a whopping 2.50 and PSP at now 5.0 firmwares.

539
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the brand new features included with that.

540
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:56,960
[SPEAKER_13]: The PSP version is getting the PlayStation Online store now, which is pretty awesome.

541
00:41:58,732 --> 00:42:02,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Also the PS3 version, Flash 9 support.

542
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:41,024
[SPEAKER_13]: and also I guess they're including support now for the official PS3 Bluetooth adapter because they're now releasing a new headset that's going to be with SOCOM and stuff.

543
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:45,726
[SPEAKER_13]: You can set your system to automatically shut down after downloading stuff.

544
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:49,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to remember what else was added with the PSP.

545
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:55,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably just some minor fixes and stuff and trying to fix it so that no one can crack it.

546
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:58,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh darn, too bad that failed again.

547
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:05,082
[SPEAKER_13]: So apparently the day after it came out, it was already cracked and the custom firmware 5.0 was released.

548
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:09,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.

549
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:12,533
[SPEAKER_12]: So, oh well.

550
00:43:13,837 --> 00:43:17,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think somebody's going to come up with a patch to patch the offensive music back in LittleBigPlanet?

551
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to go back to that story, but with people that want to keep breaking what Sony destroys.

552
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:28,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I did want to mention, though, there was a story that we didn't make it in there.

553
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:33,992
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that was included with the new PS3 firmware is there's a recovery...

554
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:37,734
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can actually help recover your system so it doesn't break, which is nice.

555
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:39,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad that they threw that in there.

556
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:57,385
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

557
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:05,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hey, you know, some of the things that they're also kind of reformatting on the Sony side, especially when it comes into the store and how things are being presented on the online store.

558
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:09,420
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like companies are now starting to get their own little special stores.

559
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Capcom is one of the first we're hearing about.

560
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:15,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Capcom has their own little like company version of the PlayStation store.

561
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:20,469
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go to the Capcom store, you can get all of Capcom's stuff kind of in one little place on the PlayStation Network store.

562
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:23,110
[SPEAKER_12]: You get the Capcom demos, their games, their themes.

563
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,470
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all in one spot.

564
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, funny enough, this wasn't an idea of Capcom's.

565
00:44:26,951 --> 00:44:30,312
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually Sony's who, I guess, must have presented the idea to them.

566
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:34,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you think this is going to be only in the Sony side of things, guess what?

567
00:44:34,113 --> 00:44:39,515
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying that the new Xbox experience that's coming out means that Microsoft will be able to do something similar for their companies.

568
00:44:40,015 --> 00:44:41,716
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be very interesting.

569
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:43,917
[SPEAKER_12]: You almost now are going to go from one...

570
00:44:44,597 --> 00:44:45,598
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of cool in a way.

571
00:44:45,638 --> 00:45:02,991
[SPEAKER_12]: In my mind, I'm envisioning now that online shopping for these networks is now going from one giant everything-stop shop that the company owns, like Microsoft's Walmart or Sony's Target, is now going to be like a strip mall where you can go into the Capcom store and go into the Konami store.

572
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:05,914
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be interesting to see what each company has to offer.

573
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:11,358
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be very, very interesting to see what this does for company branding in the video games.

574
00:45:11,638 --> 00:45:12,179
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

575
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:12,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

576
00:45:13,139 --> 00:45:14,820
[SPEAKER_12]: What stores will people visit first?

577
00:45:15,361 --> 00:45:16,662
[SPEAKER_12]: And who puts out what product?

578
00:45:16,842 --> 00:45:21,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Because back in the days of the NES, I don't think a lot of people followed these things.

579
00:45:23,406 --> 00:45:26,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Most people didn't even know that Konami and Ultra were really the same company.

580
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:29,070
[SPEAKER_12]: They just would follow a particular series or whatever.

581
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:33,814
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's very interesting now that we have this very company-branded atmosphere that these online stores are going to create.

582
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:36,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to make a response to Geekboy2424 in the chat room.

583
00:45:36,175 --> 00:45:36,575
[SPEAKER_12]: What did he say?

584
00:45:36,595 --> 00:45:39,176
[SPEAKER_12]: He disagrees with me that parents shouldn't police what their children play.

585
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:39,937
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they should.

586
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:40,577
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the parent's job.

587
00:45:40,597 --> 00:45:40,797
[SPEAKER_12]: However...

588
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:14,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't miss out that I have said parents need to be educated and actually research instead of making a blanket assumption.

589
00:46:15,293 --> 00:46:16,973
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't mean parents should put the band hammer down.

590
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:25,816
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Geekboy2424 is a rather younger listener of ours, which is why I think he might get a little bit hurt that we're saying your parents need to be watching or whatever.

591
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:28,977
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're not saying the parents need to ban everything.

592
00:46:29,277 --> 00:46:30,417
[SPEAKER_12]: The parents need to be watching.

593
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:32,158
[SPEAKER_12]: And the parents should at least know what you're doing.

594
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:32,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Educate themselves.

595
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:41,722
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as this show is concerned, I don't think folks of a certain age should necessarily even be listening to this show without their parents kind of knowing what they're listening to on the internet.

596
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:45,403
[SPEAKER_12]: I like to think we're a good influence and not a bad one, but your parents have a right to know.

597
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,244
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my suggestion.

598
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:48,925
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I used to do with my mother.

599
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:52,206
[SPEAKER_04]: True, it was over NES games when I was much younger.

600
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:56,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But why don't you find a review of the game?

601
00:46:57,088 --> 00:47:02,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Find some video clips of the game, and then say, hey, this is the game that I want to play.

602
00:47:02,673 --> 00:47:03,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mind if we pick it up?

603
00:47:04,495 --> 00:47:13,943
[SPEAKER_04]: And being an adult, hopefully they should be able to make a decision whether or not they consider what you think okay is okay.

604
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:15,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Recognize some of your passion behind it, too.

605
00:47:16,285 --> 00:47:16,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

606
00:47:16,645 --> 00:47:17,306
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

607
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:22,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe you'll get props for like, wow, our kid actually put together a whole little prosecution program.

608
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:22,991
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

609
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,290
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

610
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So help your parents make an informed decision.

611
00:47:49,011 --> 00:47:53,052
[SPEAKER_04]: If you truly think that you should have this game, put some effort into it.

612
00:47:53,112 --> 00:47:53,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them know why.

613
00:47:54,492 --> 00:47:55,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So my next story.

614
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:56,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, go ahead.

615
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

616
00:47:58,673 --> 00:48:13,037
[SPEAKER_04]: There has been a little bit of a tease now that those who finished the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock get a little teaser trailer saying Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams.

617
00:48:13,797 --> 00:48:16,265
[SPEAKER_04]: is supposed to come out sometime in the future.

618
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:46,818
[SPEAKER_12]: and there's actually I think some video up around this up on Joystick if anyone wants to take a look at it and it's your typical teaser I watched it just because I thought the first Bioshock was pretty graphically stunning just to tell you the teaser is your typical teaser video it's nothing but you know the one shot of the girl standing on the beach or whatever and the one line it's a teaser in every sense of the word and just the fact it's coming and it gives you that tagline Sea of Dreams

619
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:47,918
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

620
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:49,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

621
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:50,039
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what a teaser is.

622
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,401
[SPEAKER_12]: So, in other words, Bioshock 2 is coming.

623
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:55,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Duh!

624
00:48:55,982 --> 00:48:56,482
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

625
00:48:56,502 --> 00:48:58,163
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed some teasing to do that.

626
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,564
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess now you have a subtitle, so there you go.

627
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: When's it coming out?

628
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:03,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

629
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:03,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Soon.

630
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:04,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Someday.

631
00:49:04,426 --> 00:49:06,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I don't think it's coming out too soon.

632
00:49:06,387 --> 00:49:06,987
[SPEAKER_13]: A few years?

633
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:08,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe... 2010.

634
00:49:09,288 --> 00:49:10,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon is a blanket term.

635
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:10,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Summer 2010.

636
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:11,249
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

637
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:11,689
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a guess.

638
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:12,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I say summer 2010.

639
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:14,310
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that.

640
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,551
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just use that for everything now.

641
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:16,750
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

642
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:17,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Summer 2010.

643
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,651
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when all the games are coming out.

644
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:20,911
[SPEAKER_12]: That's when Final Fantasy XIII is coming out.

645
00:49:20,931 --> 00:49:21,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Summer 2010.

646
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,651
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be lucky if it comes out by that time.

647
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:25,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

648
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:26,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Release dates.

649
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:29,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there are other games coming out.

650
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:30,973
[SPEAKER_13]: This week, at least.

651

[SPEAKER_13]: Starting off, we've got The World of Goo, which is coming to PC.

652
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:39,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Fun little casual game there.

653
00:49:39,835 --> 00:49:43,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Did very well on a... I think it's on the Wii already.

654
00:49:43,196 --> 00:49:43,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure.

655
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:44,956
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as a WiiWare...

[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, okay.

674
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:04,751
[SPEAKER_12]: A whopping 20 bucks for that.

675
00:51:06,912 --> 00:51:08,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Why would you play a dice game on a video game?

676
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:10,513
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a good travel game.

677
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,553
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't throw pigs around in a car.

678
00:51:12,873 --> 00:51:13,633
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll get lost.

679
00:51:13,673 --> 00:51:14,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough.

680
00:51:14,494 --> 00:51:16,014

[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, just small games like Far Cry 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Fable 2 on Xbox 360, and High School Musical 3, Senior Year Dance, because I know everybody's looking forward to that.

705
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:55,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Whoopee.

706
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,251
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's all the big stuff.

707
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:00,113
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm taking a quick look here.

708
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:03,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's travel over to Japan, take a look at the Japanese release dates.

709
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:05,836
[SPEAKER_12]: There's not a lot to speak of on the Xbox 360.

710
00:54:06,717 --> 00:54:11,879
[SPEAKER_12]: NBA Live 09 gets its Japanese localization on October 23rd, that coming out from EA over in Japan.

711
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they're getting the same thing, and they sure are.

712
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:24,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, by the way, on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou is getting a price reduction on both systems, so if you haven't checked that out yet, you can.

713
00:54:26,111 --> 00:54:28,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on to the Nintendo Wii in Japan.

714
00:54:28,652 --> 00:54:36,996
[SPEAKER_12]: The Happy Dance Collection comes out from Namco Bandai this week, as well as Gensai Table Games Wii, Pro Golfer Saru, and Tenchu 4 comes out.

715
00:54:37,356 --> 00:54:37,737
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

716
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:53,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Also coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week, Devil's Summoner, a new game in the Devil's Summoner series, comes out on October 23rd, as well as Ever 17, The Out of Infinity, although I think that might just be a price reduction.

717
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:54,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's just a price reduction.

718
00:54:55,425 --> 00:55:00,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, Hakugen no Soryu Contract to Future comes out as well.

719
00:55:00,347 --> 00:55:02,728
[SPEAKER_12]: And NBA Live 09 on PlayStation 2 as well.

720
00:55:03,149 --> 00:55:07,891
[SPEAKER_12]: And a game called Never 7, The End of Infinity also gets a price reduction as well as Remember 11.

721
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:12,113
[SPEAKER_12]: And Sakura Taisen 3 also goes into Sega The Best series.

722
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:13,734
[SPEAKER_12]: So lots of price reductions this week.

723
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:15,594
[SPEAKER_12]: Price reductions this week.

724
00:55:15,794 --> 00:55:18,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't it get out to like 5 in the Sakura Taisen series?

725
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:21,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how far they got, but it's just number three.

726
00:55:21,981 --> 00:55:23,382
[SPEAKER_04]: I think four came out on Dreamcast, didn't it?

727
00:55:23,783 --> 00:55:25,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, three was out on PlayStation 2, I guess.

728
00:55:25,845 --> 00:55:28,128
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if that was a newer version or what.

729
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:55,747
[SPEAKER_12]: on the Nintendo DS Dragon Quest Monsters Joker gets a price reduction as does Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 12 Revenant Wings both getting price reductions as well as far as new games go you got Katsui Death Label as well as Kimi no Yūsha comes out from SNK Playmore on the DS as well as Soul Eater Medusa no Inubu comes out and Wakamama Fashion Gals Mode because I know you were looking forward to that but that is a first party title in Japan so go figure

730
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:56,728
[SPEAKER_12]: I want Soul Eater

731
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:20,649
[SPEAKER_12]: You want Soul Eater?

732
00:56:20,889 --> 00:56:25,152
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say, there's one small game I missed.

733
00:56:25,272 --> 00:56:25,492
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

734
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:26,673
[SPEAKER_13]: It's coming out a week from today.

735
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:29,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero World Tour.

736
00:56:30,435 --> 00:56:32,376
[SPEAKER_13]: It will be coming out on everything.

737
00:56:32,396 --> 00:56:34,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's because it's not a Tuesday game.

738
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:37,318
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Sunday game.

739
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,180
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be epic, I guess.

740
00:56:41,521 --> 00:56:45,526
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, to specify, DJ Maxx is the Classic Y edition.

741
00:56:45,606 --> 00:56:47,928
[SPEAKER_12]: There already is several DJ Maxx games on the PSP.

742
00:56:47,968 --> 00:56:48,989
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the Classic Y edition.

743
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:54,916
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, one other game I want to point out on the PSP this week in Japan from Sega, Garnet Chronicle comes out as well.

744
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:57,421
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, take us to Europe.

745
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are our European releases.

746
00:56:59,662 --> 00:57:02,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least as far as the UK is concerned.

747
00:57:02,643 --> 00:57:06,764
[SPEAKER_04]: We have on the 21st EverQuest Seeds of Destruction.

748
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like saying Destruction.

749
00:57:08,945 --> 00:57:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty freaking awesome.

750
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:11,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Destruction of Destruction.

751
00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: this should just be ultimate destruction destroying the destructors or something new game from OLR Studios on the 24th we have Dead Space looking forward to that Disaster Day of Crisis, Dungeon Maker Fable 2, which actually my husband has to work for the midnight launch tomorrow so I'm gonna laugh we also have Legendary on Xbox 360 well I don't LittleBigPlanet is given the 24th date um

752
00:57:41,869 --> 00:57:43,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Although we know that's not going to happen anymore.

753
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, but I'm just saying.

754
00:57:46,012 --> 00:57:54,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles Remix on PSP.

755
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Ocean The First Departure on PSP.

756
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:00,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Not too bad, huh?

757
00:58:01,484 --> 00:58:02,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a bad week at all.

758
00:58:03,026 --> 00:58:06,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just going to get busier and busier as we get closer to the holiday.

759
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:10,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that one last game that I had mentioned...

760
00:58:13,041 --> 00:58:14,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero World Tour

761
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:56,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Polly, Something in the Way, Stay Away, and Territorial Pissings And each of those is available for $2 Or you can save $3 by the whole packet for $11 or $880 But isn't it interesting that it's completely missing like the biggest songs on that album Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are I think was on that album too Isn't that strange?

762
00:58:56,957 --> 00:59:06,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it is a little strange, except I think it smells like Teen Spirits in Guitar Hero World Tour, and I'm not sure about the rest of them.

763
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:09,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but it's not like games haven't shared the same songs before.

764
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:11,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they may have exclusive rights to that song.

765
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:12,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Money talks.

766
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,020
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

767
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:20,253
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, hey, if you have opted for Guitar Hero World Tour, one of the things you can look forward to downloading next year.

768
00:59:20,454 --> 00:59:23,257
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right, they're announcing download stuff for next year on the Guitar Hero side.

769
00:59:24,238 --> 00:59:26,300
[SPEAKER_12]: The brand new Oasis album, Dig Out Your Soul.

770
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,903
[SPEAKER_12]: I had no idea that Oasis was still putting out music.

771
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:30,965
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't heard much of their stuff.

772
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:34,589
[SPEAKER_12]: There's probably some British folks over on the other side of the pond that are like bonk.

773
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:38,591
[SPEAKER_12]: to me, but they don't play them on the radio at all here anymore.

774
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:40,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Not since Wonderwall back in the mid-90s.

775
00:59:41,973 --> 00:59:43,074
[SPEAKER_12]: But they are still cranking out music.

776
00:59:43,114 --> 00:59:46,976
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a new album coming out, Dig Out Your Soul, and that will be coming out next year.

777
00:59:47,076 --> 00:59:53,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the singles from that album, Bag It Up, Waiting for the Rapture, The Shock of the Lightning, are all coming out on Guitar Hero World Tour.

778
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:01,124
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you are an Oasis fan, and you're mad at me for my comment of not hearing them lately, you at least have that to look forward to.

779
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:02,445
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

780
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:06,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's some more rumors.

781
01:00:06,216 --> 01:00:06,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, wait a minute.

782
01:00:06,957 --> 01:00:08,518
[SPEAKER_12]: You're the resident Blur fan girl.

783
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:12,641
[SPEAKER_12]: We haven't heard a lot of Blur, like, I love Blur talk on the show lately.

784
01:00:13,282 --> 01:00:16,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't Blur and Oasis have like a feud thing years ago?

785
01:00:17,525 --> 01:00:18,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Did they ever get over that?

786
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:26,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, well, since Blur is basically disbanded because Graham Coxon got really offended when they told him, stop drinking!

787
01:00:28,313 --> 01:00:29,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, well, screw you guys.

788
01:00:29,974 --> 01:00:31,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You throw me out of the band, I'm never coming back.

789
01:00:32,436 --> 01:00:33,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew that was the story, right?

790
01:00:34,266 --> 01:00:35,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Did he call them all bloody wankers?

791
01:00:35,811 --> 01:00:37,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if he did, that's too good.

792
01:00:38,227 --> 01:00:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably things a lot worse than calling someone a wanker.

793
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:46,689
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Graham Coxon has gone off to do his own thing.

794
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:53,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Damon has gorillas and also has The Good, The Bad, and The Queen, which is pretty freaking good.

795
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:58,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was thinking maybe if Guitar Hero is getting Oasis, this might mean Blur for Rock Band.

796
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:02,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I would totally love it if we had Blur for Rock Band.

797
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:07,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we need to do a list list just for me of what Blur songs do we want to hear in Rock Band.

798
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,820
[SPEAKER_12]: And those look good, Bob.

799
01:01:33,217 --> 01:01:35,198
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm eating, by the way, Orange Lounge Foodio for a minute.

800
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I found these when I was in the Bay Area this weekend, and I about crapped myself.

801
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:40,841
[SPEAKER_12]: I was so excited.

802
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:42,622
[SPEAKER_12]: They're flat fortune cookies.

803
01:01:43,262 --> 01:01:47,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're fortune cookies, but they're just ironed out flat and without the fortune, obviously, in them.

804
01:01:47,764 --> 01:01:48,845
[SPEAKER_12]: But I love the taste of fortune cookies.

805
01:01:48,865 --> 01:01:49,665
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're misfortune cookies.

806
01:01:49,845 --> 01:01:50,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

807
01:01:50,926 --> 01:01:53,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know there's probably some of our listeners going, big fucking deal.

808
01:01:53,307 --> 01:01:55,468
[SPEAKER_12]: But you can't get these here anywhere.

809
01:01:55,688 --> 01:01:56,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I've looked.

810
01:01:56,489 --> 01:02:00,591
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to go to the freaking fortune cookie factory in the Bay Area to find them or Long's Drugs, apparently.

811
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:01,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Go figure.

812
01:02:02,716 --> 01:02:03,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, random thought.

813
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just looking at the golden shiny goodness.

814
01:02:06,283 --> 01:02:06,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you like one?

815
01:02:07,145 --> 01:02:07,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love one now.

816
01:02:07,846 --> 01:02:08,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, here you go.

817
01:02:08,608 --> 01:02:09,209
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm bringing it over.

818
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:11,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, cookie.

819
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,530
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a pancake.

820
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,651
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like a freaking pancake.

821
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:15,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold up to the camera.

822
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:19,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Those of you that are watching on Justin.TV, I'll give you a cookie, too, while Jamie reads the story.

823
01:02:19,295 --> 01:02:20,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

824
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:31,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, there is a very shaky teaser trailer up for Guitar Hero Metallica, which I had been hearing them speak of before, so I don't think it's that far off.

825
01:02:31,585 --> 01:02:32,346
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's saying...

826
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:42,833
[SPEAKER_04]: The trailer is supposed to come with Guitar Hero World Tour, and it has a Ride the Lightning 2009 something.

827
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Because that's not cheesy or anything.

828
01:02:46,515 --> 01:02:54,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Metallica has finally gotten off of their music, electronic distribution, and just said, cool.

829
01:02:55,182 --> 01:02:59,223
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they still have to do that to be edgy, you know, but they're going for it.

830
01:02:59,403 --> 01:03:04,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do also have to say that the Metallica tracks in Rock Band 2 are fucking hard!

831
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe they just like playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero.

832
01:03:07,506 --> 01:03:13,308
[SPEAKER_12]: So they decided to, you know, and Guitar Hero comes and says, hey, we'll do a whole freaking game about you guys.

833
01:03:13,468 --> 01:03:14,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're like, cool.

834
01:03:14,929 --> 01:03:17,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Or they saw what they did with Aerosmith and were like, we want that shit.

835
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:23,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and Metallica is the epitome of awesome rock before they sold out, so...

836
01:03:27,078 --> 01:03:45,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope for their sake that they learn from Rock Band and decide to go ahead and allow each of those games that they release separately to be able to be downloaded so that you can play tracks in your Guitar Hero World Tour game.

837
01:03:46,094 --> 01:03:47,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that would suck otherwise.

838
01:03:48,175 --> 01:03:52,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially if there's a lot of games coming out like they were saying that they were going to do.

839
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:53,640
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

840
01:03:54,987 --> 01:03:55,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Like a cock?

841
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, crazy like the cock.

842
01:04:15,365 --> 01:04:22,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, though, they release a lot of independent games, of course, like I think actually this week.

843
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:22,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember.

844
01:04:22,931 --> 01:04:24,051
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe I forgot it.

845
01:04:24,372 --> 01:04:26,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Legendary should be coming out.

846
01:04:27,334 --> 01:04:31,217
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one game that they're publishing as well as Velvet Assassin that's going to be coming out later on.

847
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:35,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, but they did that Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game that was horrible.

848
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:36,640
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's South Peak.

849
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:36,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

850
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:39,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, South Peak did... I'm talking about Gamecock.

851
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:41,924
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought Gamecock did that game.

852
01:04:42,184 --> 01:04:42,645
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

853
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:45,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think they did.

854
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:46,547
[SPEAKER_13]: They may have been publishing it.

855
01:04:46,607 --> 01:04:47,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

856
01:04:47,128 --> 01:04:47,788
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a publisher.

857
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:49,249
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't make the games.

858
01:04:49,269 --> 01:04:51,010
[SPEAKER_13]: They just publish them.

859
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:53,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the Pirates and Ninjas Dodgeball.

860
01:04:54,032 --> 01:04:57,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe not exactly the glowing example of their portfolio, but...

861
01:04:58,536 --> 01:05:06,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Legendary looked good, and Mushroom Man sort of okay, but there's a lot more games they're putting out, and they're increasingly getting better.

862
01:05:07,186 --> 01:05:07,887
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's nice.

863
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:12,112
[SPEAKER_13]: South Peak, on the other hand, they've been releasing what?

864
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:13,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Overlord?

865
01:05:14,435 --> 01:05:14,995
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool.

866
01:05:18,069 --> 01:05:19,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, everyone was pretty sweet.

867
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,111
[SPEAKER_13]: They had some other stuff.

868
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:24,172
[SPEAKER_13]: X-Blades, I think, was one of theirs as well.

869
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:30,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if one of the first orders of business at South Peak is going to be telling the guys at Gamecock to sit down and shut up.

870
01:05:30,696 --> 01:05:33,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, they're kind of known for just making a lot of noise.

871
01:05:33,377 --> 01:05:33,918
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

872
01:05:33,938 --> 01:05:34,598
[SPEAKER_12]: They just make noise.

873
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:36,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Some people don't get it.

874
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, sometimes you kind of look at them and go, they're just kind of weird and need to shut up.

875
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:40,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't get it.

876
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:41,482
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that they're, like...

877
01:05:42,322 --> 01:05:45,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I get the sense Gamecock kind of runs themselves like a fraternity.

878
01:05:46,823 --> 01:05:51,665
[SPEAKER_12]: For real, I get the sense that they have raging kegger parties at some of their company things, events, right?

879
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:53,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that.

880
01:05:53,785 --> 01:06:00,707
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like this giant gaming fraternity, and I'm sure it's a fun as hell place to work, but sometimes you look at that and go, okay.

881
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:09,890
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to remember that in every good frat party movie that there's always a montage sequence where they have to pull it together and act a little bit less...

882
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,052
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

883
01:06:19,926 --> 01:06:20,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand scheme of things.

884
01:06:21,307 --> 01:06:25,570
[SPEAKER_12]: GameGuru in chat wants to say, South Peak didn't have anything to do with Pirates vs. Ninjas dodgeball.

885
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:26,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Gamecock published it, though.

886
01:06:27,892 --> 01:06:30,474
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought I saw their logo on that game, and I'm sorry.

887
01:06:31,015 --> 01:06:40,862
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about this, I think, last week or two weeks ago when DarkSakura's classic game of the week was the dodgeball game from Neo Geo that I thought the Pirates vs. Ninja game was kind of assy compared to Neo Geo 1.

888
01:06:40,902 --> 01:06:42,223
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was a dumb idea to begin with.

889
01:06:42,263 --> 01:06:46,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, they're all, oh, Pirates vs. Ninjas, we're going to sell this match once and for all.

890
01:06:47,287 --> 01:06:48,407
[SPEAKER_13]: with Dodgeball.

891
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:50,008
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like, lame.

892
01:06:50,608 --> 01:06:51,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Tune out.

893
01:06:51,628 --> 01:06:55,869
[SPEAKER_12]: SSJ100 Matt in chat says, if Gamecock has kegger parties, then OLR has pie parties.

894
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Not true.

895
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight is a flat fortune cookie party.

896
01:06:58,690 --> 01:06:59,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Pancake cookie.

897
01:07:00,151 --> 01:07:01,531
[SPEAKER_04]: And they taste like pancakes too.

898
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:02,511
[SPEAKER_12]: They're delish.

899
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they taste like pancakes?

900
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:04,512
[SPEAKER_12]: They taste like yummy.

901
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:07,004
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

902
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was video and screenshots of them playing.

903
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,381
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's totally exclusive.

904
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:46,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, sure enough, they've confirmed this week that due to overwhelming fan response, that soon you will be able to download Darth Vader and Yoda in Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the respective versions that are missing it.

905
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:49,609
[SPEAKER_12]: You'll be able to download them on October 23rd.

906
01:07:49,689 --> 01:07:53,591
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if that's a US or a Japanese date, but you know it's going to happen everywhere.

907
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:54,211
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, come on.

908
01:07:54,531 --> 01:07:59,374
[SPEAKER_13]: October 23rd, you know that's almost exactly three months from the game's release.

909
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:00,374
[SPEAKER_13]: What a coinkydink.

910
01:08:00,434 --> 01:08:04,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Huh, wonder if they had an exclusive deal for three months.

911
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:05,817
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll set you back $5.

912
01:08:07,138 --> 01:08:09,880
[SPEAKER_12]: That's 400 Microsoft points, or in Sony terms, $5.

913
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Or $4.99, I'm sorry, in Sony terms, $4.99.

914
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:18,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Sony's not going to do anything with that extra penny.

915
01:08:19,147 --> 01:08:20,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, isn't that wonderful?

916
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:27,891
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to put full amounts, full dollars into your account, but they charge you $4.99, so there's always a remainder.

917
01:08:27,911 --> 01:08:29,692
[SPEAKER_13]: But Loki, credit card fees.

918
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:32,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, cry.

919
01:08:35,135 --> 01:08:36,395
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm a consumer whore.

920
01:08:36,415 --> 01:08:37,216
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably get it anyway.

921
01:08:37,236 --> 01:08:37,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And hell.

922
01:08:37,816 --> 01:08:38,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Just charge even amounts.

923
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:40,237
[SPEAKER_13]: God, who cares?

924
01:08:41,058 --> 01:08:44,199
[SPEAKER_13]: $4.99 may seem cheaper, but seriously, people know how to do math.

925
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:45,980
[SPEAKER_13]: They understand it's only one cent cheaper.

926
01:08:47,864 --> 01:09:16,694
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm glad though I can say I told you so I told you so to my friend that said I have to get the PlayStation 3 version of Soul Calibur because it's the only way I'll get to play Vader and secretly I think he just wanted to play me online and I'm like just wait there will be download content it's inevitable and I'll bet you what you know what I bet you money I will bet you money significant amount of money this is not download content it's pay to unlock content money I posted a picture in the chat room by the way of the view from where I sit

927
01:09:19,093 --> 01:09:20,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you for that.

928
01:09:20,474 --> 01:09:21,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It's of Rob's head.

929
01:09:21,854 --> 01:09:22,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, great.

930
01:09:23,915 --> 01:09:25,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of your pancake cookies.

931
01:09:25,436 --> 01:09:25,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Yummy.

932
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:26,296
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

933
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:31,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of yummy, resistance to kids like aliens.

934
01:09:33,699 --> 01:09:35,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Kids should not be playing the game because it is mature.

935
01:09:38,898 --> 01:09:44,445
[SPEAKER_04]: The beta for Resistance 2 began on Friday.

936
01:09:45,126 --> 01:09:47,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those who got in, let us know how it is.

937
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what you can tell us.

938
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:51,074
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some opinion here or there.

939
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be going from...

940
01:09:57,742 --> 01:10:02,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the 20th of October, so I guess actually that's... No, I'm sorry, that's in Europe.

941
01:10:03,005 --> 01:10:08,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It's starting on Monday the 20th, and it's going to be going on until Thursday the 13th of November.

942
01:10:09,588 --> 01:10:19,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And there will be keys that are given out from IGN, but there's no date as to when those keys will be given out, so keep your eyes on IGN for a little bit more on that.

943
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:21,274
[SPEAKER_13]: I like how the beta's going longer than actually the game.

944
01:10:21,614 --> 01:10:23,695
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the game's coming out in the middle of the beta.

945
01:10:25,316 --> 01:10:26,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the UK dates.

946
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:30,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, you try to get into betas that you probably don't belong in.

947
01:10:30,086 --> 01:10:31,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to get into this one?

948
01:10:32,527 --> 01:10:33,387
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even going to try.

949
01:10:33,407 --> 01:10:35,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

950
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:39,249
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really play much of the... Actually, I didn't play any of the multiplayer in Resistance 1.

951
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:42,831
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I sold my copy back yesterday.

952
01:10:42,911 --> 01:10:43,991
[SPEAKER_12]: But you still enjoyed the game, right?

953
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:45,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the game was awesome.

954
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:46,772
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will plan on getting it.

955
01:10:46,832 --> 01:10:50,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I'm in brokery now, so I cannot buy the game.

956
01:10:51,874 --> 01:10:52,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

957
01:10:52,194 --> 01:10:53,255
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to wait a few weeks.

958
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:54,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there you go.

959
01:10:56,116 --> 01:10:56,476
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um...

960
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

961
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:03,409
[SPEAKER_13]: The last few multiplayer betas I've been in, Call of Duty 4, I didn't really play much.

962
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:06,390
[SPEAKER_13]: What else did I get in?

963
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:08,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Battlefield Bad Company, I didn't even play that at all.

964
01:11:09,452 --> 01:11:12,554
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a horrible beta tester.

965
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:15,035
[SPEAKER_12]: For what it's worth, I played the Wrath of the Lich King beta once.

966
01:11:15,851 --> 01:11:18,352
[SPEAKER_12]: I went through all that patching and all that crap to play it once.

967
01:11:18,953 --> 01:11:19,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was it.

968
01:11:19,473 --> 01:11:20,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I went back to regular WoW.

969
01:11:20,213 --> 01:11:21,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't that mean you don't have to patch it later?

970
01:11:22,114 --> 01:11:24,155
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was a completely separate thing.

971
01:11:24,776 --> 01:11:26,477
[SPEAKER_12]: No, because you still have to buy the retail copy of it.

972
01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:29,858
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to change some things from what was in the beta.

973
01:11:31,179 --> 01:11:36,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's finally here for those people clamoring to play a translation of Mother 3.

974
01:11:37,683 --> 01:11:42,445
[SPEAKER_13]: You can now download the patch for your ROM that you may have of Mother 3.

975
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:44,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you would

976
01:11:44,856 --> 01:11:49,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Need to have an import copy of the game because, you know, to make it legit.

977
01:11:49,178 --> 01:11:51,158
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can now download the patch.

978
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:56,820
[SPEAKER_13]: The update, which has been worked on for a while now, is finally available.

979
01:11:56,940 --> 01:12:01,402
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty awesome now that you get to play Mother 3, which I don't know.

980
01:12:01,422 --> 01:12:03,843
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why they don't just translate it.

981
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:08,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Seriously, why do they refuse to put that game out over here?

982
01:12:08,965 --> 01:12:12,966
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it is literally a refusal on Nintendo's part to just put that game out here.

983
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:25,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just weird how adamant they are.

984
01:12:25,906 --> 01:12:30,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I can't imagine it costs that much money to translate, but maybe it's because then they have to produce the game.

985
01:12:30,507 --> 01:12:30,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

986
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,288
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just sad.

987
01:12:33,408 --> 01:12:37,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you look at some of the stuff that is coming out from Nintendo on these systems, and you just go, why?

988
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Personal training cooking.

989
01:12:41,849 --> 01:12:43,069
[SPEAKER_13]: That is awesome.

990
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:54,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only are they a little behind in putting that out because there's going to be about four or five other cooking games coming out around the same time, I don't think anyone's going to buy it.

991
01:12:54,272 --> 01:13:02,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm sure there's people out there that actually purchase every single Nintendo game that comes out, but dude, seriously, you might start questioning that.

992
01:13:04,256 --> 01:13:07,517
[SPEAKER_12]: One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and get to our break tonight.

993
01:13:07,597 --> 01:13:17,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, ladies, if you're still looking for a Halloween costume, you know your gamer man in your life might enjoy the sexy lingerie with Ms.

994
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Pac-Man's likeness on it.

995
01:13:19,761 --> 01:13:21,681
[SPEAKER_12]: It will look like that Pac-Man and Ms.

996
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:27,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Pac-Man are eating your boobies because that's what this bra looks like is that you actually have.

997
01:13:27,523 --> 01:13:28,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Pac-Man and Ms.

998
01:13:28,343 --> 01:13:28,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Pac-Man.

999
01:13:28,963 --> 01:13:31,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Or just click on the show roll link and you get this picture.

1000
01:13:31,464 --> 01:13:32,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude.

1001
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:34,985
[SPEAKER_12]: But it looked, I mean, they're sexy little outfits.

1002
01:13:35,005 --> 01:13:35,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I get that.

1003
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:41,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And I like how when the model, like there's a little like, I don't know what you want to call it, like gladiator style skirt with little flaps.

1004
01:13:42,187 --> 01:13:48,349
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you lift up the flaps, it reveals Inky, one of the ghosts, or maybe it's Binky or Pinky, I don't know.

1005
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:51,210
[SPEAKER_12]: But on your panties, right where your cooter is.

1006
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:53,951
[SPEAKER_12]: So nice little surprise there.

1007
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:54,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, ooh, ghost.

1008
01:13:56,464 --> 01:14:02,647
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would like to point out that the ghost is blue, which means it is an appropriate time to munch it.

1009
01:14:04,428 --> 01:14:05,468
[SPEAKER_12]: For 200 points.

1010
01:14:08,009 --> 01:14:12,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, 3wishes.com is where you can buy Miss Video Game.

1011
01:14:12,971 --> 01:14:15,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, while you're at it, you can also pick up their Chun-Li outfit if you'd like to.

1012
01:14:17,173 --> 01:14:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I shall be clicking on a linky.

1013
01:14:21,015 --> 01:14:23,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to be buying Miss Video Game for Dan this Halloween?

1014
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:25,258
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1015
01:14:54,801 --> 01:14:59,305
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this week's Classic Game of the Week is probably one a lot of people have played, I'm guessing.

1016
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: If they haven't, they suck.

1017
01:15:02,808 --> 01:15:05,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe we're too young to see it the first time.

1018
01:15:05,089 --> 01:15:05,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Or suck.

1019
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:08,392
[SPEAKER_12]: But you need to go find this game, right, DarkSakura?

1020
01:15:08,973 --> 01:15:09,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Or you suck.

1021
01:15:09,513 --> 01:15:10,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get it on PSP, shit.

1022
01:15:10,834 --> 01:15:12,395
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, tell us about it.

1023
01:15:12,436 --> 01:15:13,757
[SPEAKER_12]: What is this week's Classic Game of the Week?

1024
01:15:14,037 --> 01:15:15,818
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two games, but they're together.

1025
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:16,379
[SPEAKER_04]: One's a sequel.

1026
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Parappa the Rapper and Parappa the Rapper 2.

1027
01:15:19,001 --> 01:15:22,324
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is music from the first Parappa.

1028
01:15:22,344 --> 01:15:22,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Parappa.

1029
01:15:25,595 --> 01:15:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you not know this song?

1030
01:15:26,937 --> 01:15:29,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, the demo came with what?

1031
01:15:38,675 --> 01:15:39,376
[SPEAKER_12]: and I'll see you next time.

1032
01:15:59,498 --> 01:16:04,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, he goes around rapping against different people, so it's really a music rhythm game.

1033
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Simon Says, really, where the words that whoever, you know, whichever the masters that you're going against, their words will have a pattern of button presses, and then you have to repeat it for yours, or do something that corresponds.

1034
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:20,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually more proper, too.

1035
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and of course the better you do, the better your score.

1036
01:16:24,111 --> 01:16:28,273
[SPEAKER_04]: If you start sucking, then you go to bad, you're not rapping cool.

1037
01:16:28,373 --> 01:16:41,838
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go, if you get from, you know, rapping good to rapping cool, then the stage just completely goes off and you take over and you just have to keep pressing buttons randomly until the stage is over, which was actually the only way I passed the stage from Jeremy Lammy, which we'll get to later.

1038
01:16:43,298 --> 01:17:02,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, speak, uh, the game was made by, um, uh, Masaya Matsura, um, who was, uh, actually, uh, one of the, uh, the leader of the Hyperpop unit for, uh, but he was also, um, the company that brought out the game was Nana Onsha, so, if anyone remembers.

1039
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:04,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Onsha.

1040
01:17:04,293 --> 01:17:04,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1041
01:17:06,067 --> 01:17:07,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I played this game literally a million times.

1042
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:09,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And Unchamelami.

1043
01:17:09,752 --> 01:17:10,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I love these games.

1044
01:17:11,595 --> 01:17:15,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, your meter, like I was saying before, you have a rapping good.

1045
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when you're doing okay.

1046
01:17:18,043 --> 01:17:19,325
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're doing as you're expected to.

1047
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:20,767
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're rapping bad...

1048
01:17:21,227 --> 01:17:26,469
[SPEAKER_04]: The art was done by Rodney Greenblatt, and he's got a website that's just got tons of his art.

1049
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:28,250
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also did have a sequel.

1050
01:17:49,557 --> 01:17:51,118
[SPEAKER_04]: which we're getting to the music of next week.

1051
01:17:51,138 --> 01:17:52,858
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will hear the music from the sequel right now.

1052
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:57,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is just the start of it.

1053
01:17:57,519 --> 01:17:58,480
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Parappa 2.

1054
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:04,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't put Umjermalami in here, while even though it plays the same, it feels differently, I think.

1055
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:05,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you agree?

1056
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:11,764
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I mean, it is a different game, but it's like, it's not a sequel, but an equal, if that makes sense.

1057
01:18:11,784 --> 01:18:15,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and Umjermalami and friends make an appearance in this game.

1058
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,826
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had to pick the best music in Parappa 2.

1059
01:18:19,855 --> 01:18:21,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we get a cutscene with this one.

1060
01:18:21,116 --> 01:18:22,276
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if we go straight to the song.

1061
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:23,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, we go straight to the song.

1062
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:25,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey everybody, watch out for those flying noodles.

1063
01:18:25,717 --> 01:18:29,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you don't do well here, all you get to eat are noodles.

1064
01:18:29,959 --> 01:18:30,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

1065
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra, extra, we'd all about it.

1066
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back for more because my store's a bore.

1067
01:18:34,981 --> 01:18:40,223
[SPEAKER_00]: I travel shore to shore, door to door, looking around for some perfect store.

1068
01:18:40,243 --> 01:18:43,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut to lettuce, throw to savannas.

1069
01:18:45,645 --> 01:18:49,390
[SPEAKER_04]: See if you can find Sister Musation.

1070
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:49,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I will.

1071
01:18:50,651 --> 01:18:57,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, the reason why I had to put Parappa 2 up on there is because the music is just a lot better.

1072
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes into different styles.

1073
01:18:59,242 --> 01:19:01,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love the Parappa 2 soundtrack.

1074
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:29,956
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had to pick that particular level because there's one stage where Parappa has to trap himself in a video game Or else everybody in the universe has to eat noodles forever And that's as far as I'll say without spoiling the rest of the story of the game If you haven't played it, God knows why you haven't But it also really goes there a lot more stylistically As far as having stages where you change perspective within your 3D environment Like the ant guru

1075
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:39,868
[SPEAKER_04]: or, um, you know, where you, uh... That's from the first Parappa.

1076
01:19:39,948 --> 01:19:41,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I thought you wanted this from the movie show.

1077
01:19:41,269 --> 01:19:42,490
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the one from Parappa 2.

1078
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,011
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what stage number was it?

1079
01:19:44,411 --> 01:19:45,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Four, I think.

1080
01:19:45,632 --> 01:19:46,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1081
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:49,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this is one of my favorite songs from Parappa, so... Yeah, we'll play a little bit of it.

1082
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:02,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you hear how it's doing the multiple things?

1083
01:20:03,503 --> 01:20:11,209
[SPEAKER_04]: If you sort of freestyle a little bit with it, it increases your score and if it's good enough, that shoots you into cool mode.

1084
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:12,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much.

1085
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:28,663
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so... Now, going back to this, I mentioned it before, is that there is a PSP version and I happened to look into my copy for about $13 when a Hollywood video was going out of business and

1086
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:32,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, it's, uh, it's the same thing.

1087
01:20:32,983 --> 01:20:34,864
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got lots of different versus modes in it.

1088
01:20:35,445 --> 01:20:42,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Jammer Lamy, we will, we'll definitely be, uh... Yeah, here's another one.

1089
01:20:55,273 --> 01:20:57,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And who could forget the bathroom rap in the first game?

1090
01:20:57,135 --> 01:20:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: God, I know.

1091
01:20:59,477 --> 01:21:02,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially as often as it's been quoted.

1092
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:11,687
[SPEAKER_04]: But this was, I think that Parappa 2 though, if you can just listen to the difference between how much more complex the music is, I really like it a lot better, personally.

1093
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:26,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Umjermalami was another game that's in the same vein and I was saying I'll probably cover it on another one because it honestly is, I think, different enough within the style of music that it can qualify as a different game.

1094
01:21:27,309 --> 01:21:28,872
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was Parabamon in it.

1095
01:21:30,194 --> 01:21:35,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Parappa Mode was pretty freaking cool because it turned all these rockin' songs into rap.

1096
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:37,616
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some differences.

1097
01:21:38,956 --> 01:21:45,678
[SPEAKER_04]: A few lines that were changed as far as one release to the other.

1098
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:51,439
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an anime, a Parappa anime, that I thought was really, really cute.

1099
01:21:52,499 --> 01:21:54,421
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in Japan.

1100
01:21:54,441 --> 01:21:57,084
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually has a really cool little intro song to it, too.

1101
01:21:58,085 --> 01:22:13,139
[SPEAKER_04]: But for anyone, when I was speaking about the artist, Rodney Greenblatt, his website is whimsyload.com, W-H-I-M-S-Y, load, L-O-A-D, dot com.

1102
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,561
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all one word, dot com.

1103
01:22:15,702 --> 01:22:23,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And while his artwork may seem fairly simplistic, he's got some really nice and complex stuff on there.

1104
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Some sculpture, different medium he uses, and I really admire his work.

1105
01:22:32,357 --> 01:22:34,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it my recent education.

1106
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:49,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the lyrics to this tune.

1107
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:55,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember driving around San Francisco one time after picking up somebody and he brought the CD and we listened to it.

1108
01:22:56,469 --> 01:22:57,450
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Rain or in the Snow.

1109
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:09,235
[SPEAKER_04]: We've often referred to as the after effects of certain eating at gym boys as the funky flow.

1110
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:10,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

1111
01:23:10,936 --> 01:23:11,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1112
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Really not joking.

1113
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:17,919
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's their game.

1114
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Parappa and Parappa 2.

1115
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,221
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

1116
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Your classic game of the week.

1117
01:23:21,201 --> 01:23:24,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Parappa the Rappa and its sequel Parappa the Rappa 2.

1118
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:25,384
[SPEAKER_12]: Two for the price of one.

1119
01:23:26,164 --> 01:23:28,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't mention one without mentioning the other.

1120
01:23:28,285 --> 01:23:28,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1121
01:23:28,765 --> 01:23:30,166
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a necessity.

1122
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:40,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I like the second Parappa better as a game and music-wise, but you cannot mention the second one without mentioning the one that started it all.

1123
01:23:41,011 --> 01:23:41,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?

1124
01:23:41,511 --> 01:23:42,671
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, you sure cannot.

1125
01:23:43,111 --> 01:23:45,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, there you have it, your classic game of the week.

1126
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:46,812
[SPEAKER_12]: And that means it's break time, folks.

1127
01:23:46,872 --> 01:23:50,293
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we come back, we haven't even really touched a lot of the Microsoft news going on in the world.

1128
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:54,314
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft might be giving out some free memory cards soon.

1129
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:56,495
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to be talking about that when we come back from this break.

1130
01:23:57,155 --> 01:24:02,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And some other stuff, including that story I referenced a little bit earlier about something in a game that pisses me off a little bit.

1131
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:04,357
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is something...

1132
01:24:05,382 --> 01:24:07,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Come participate with Orange Lounge Radio.

1133
01:24:29,241 --> 01:24:29,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange... Lounge...

1134
01:24:59,097 --> 01:25:00,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Hail to the king, baby!

1135
01:25:23,317 --> 01:25:24,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we're pretty smart.

1136
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:44,040
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the Oscar clip for tonight's episode, episode number 299.

1137
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,062
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a big show next week.

1138
01:25:46,082 --> 01:25:51,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, that fart over there must mean that Fart Princess is joining us here in studio.

1139
01:25:51,987 --> 01:25:54,769
[SPEAKER_12]: It just surprised us by joining us during the break.

1140
01:25:54,789 --> 01:25:55,810
[SPEAKER_12]: I had no idea you were coming tonight.

1141
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:56,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Fart Princess.

1142
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:56,831
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you?

1143
01:25:57,312 --> 01:25:59,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I was just supplementing the Oscar material.

1144
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:00,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, thank you.

1145
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:00,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Farting.

1146
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:02,977
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, she's no longer Rice Princess.

1147
01:26:02,997 --> 01:26:03,938
[SPEAKER_12]: She's Fart Princess.

1148
01:26:04,957 --> 01:26:05,497
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a liar.

1149
01:26:05,698 --> 01:26:07,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, so there you go.

1150
01:26:07,499 --> 01:26:10,681
[SPEAKER_12]: And also joining us tonight, I haven't seen you in a long time.

1151
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:11,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what's up?

1152
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:12,022
[SPEAKER_12]: How you doing?

1153
01:26:12,122 --> 01:26:12,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty good.

1154
01:26:12,622 --> 01:26:13,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, what are we calling you these days?

1155
01:26:13,803 --> 01:26:16,725
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it used to be Casper the Gay, but I now go by the Doctor.

1156
01:26:17,025 --> 01:26:18,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Now the Doctor, okay.

1157
01:26:18,126 --> 01:26:18,466
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the Doctor.

1158
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:19,347
[SPEAKER_12]: She's on a screwdriver.

1159
01:26:19,587 --> 01:26:21,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a sonic screwdriver right here.

1160
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:23,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and our guests are extremely loud tonight.

1161
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,270
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know what happened there.

1162
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:24,871
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very sorry.

1163
01:26:24,911 --> 01:26:25,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I left mine at home.

1164
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:28,053
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll figure that out.

1165
01:26:28,133 --> 01:26:28,994
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll adjust the volume.

1166
01:26:29,514 --> 01:26:29,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see.

1167
01:26:30,134 --> 01:26:30,715
[SPEAKER_03]: As we move in.

1168
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:34,077
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually have a listener, I think, called The Doctor, too, and now there's going to be some confusion.

1169
01:26:34,097 --> 01:26:35,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I can see Rob's butt.

1170
01:26:35,378 --> 01:26:36,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see your Sonic screwdriver.

1171
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:37,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, I've got to adjust the volume.

1172
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,760
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the little one?

1173
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:39,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1174
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:41,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really.

1175
01:26:41,782 --> 01:26:42,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not Sonic, then.

1176
01:26:42,723 --> 01:26:45,845
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but after the show, I'm going to play with Captain Jack's on a screwdriver.

1177
01:26:45,945 --> 01:26:47,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh.

1178
01:26:48,146 --> 01:26:48,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my.

1179
01:26:50,187 --> 01:26:57,192
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's actually what I was planning on doing for Halloween, is getting a blue suit and tie and wearing my Converse's and going as Chick Doctor.

1180
01:26:57,628 --> 01:26:59,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, that'd be so awesome and then we would match.

1181
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:00,290
[SPEAKER_04]: For our work thing.

1182
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:01,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm going to be Doctor Who as well.

1183
01:27:01,591 --> 01:27:03,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually got, well, I've got the black ones.

1184
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:07,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually either going to do the blue suit or do like a different color suit and be Chick Doctor.

1185
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:08,655
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be so awesome.

1186
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,176
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nice to have guests in the studio.

1187
01:27:10,216 --> 01:27:15,280
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a long time, especially considering episode 300 of this program, if you can believe it, is next week.

1188
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my.

1189
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:18,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, episode 300 is next week.

1190
01:27:18,742 --> 01:27:19,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my.

1191
01:27:19,162 --> 01:27:26,587
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're doing nothing special for it except soliciting congratulations and whatever's memories from our listeners on 877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.

1192
01:27:28,168 --> 01:27:29,289
[SPEAKER_10]: You should do something special.

1193
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:32,852
[SPEAKER_12]: We might do some games next week, so you kids should come back.

1194
01:27:33,573 --> 01:27:34,113
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you have it.

1195
01:27:34,734 --> 01:27:36,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

1196
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:39,157
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys want to comment on the news, you have a microphone, feel free to comment.

1197
01:27:39,197 --> 01:27:41,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Just refrain from fart noises, Fart Princess.

1198
01:27:41,539 --> 01:27:42,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need more fart noises?

1199
01:27:44,341 --> 01:27:44,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1200
01:27:46,243 --> 01:27:53,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that I come back from break and talk about what an intelligent show we're having tonight, and then Fart Princess shows up to fuck the whole thing up.

1201
01:27:54,657 --> 01:27:56,118
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you talking about?

1202
01:27:56,658 --> 01:27:58,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob.

1203
01:27:58,820 --> 01:27:59,080
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1204
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:02,102
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1205
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:03,102
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1206
01:28:04,103 --> 01:28:05,584
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to go from extremes.

1207
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to keep the listeners guessing.

1208
01:28:07,505 --> 01:28:11,427
[SPEAKER_12]: There's the show I was missing somehow.

1209
01:28:11,447 --> 01:28:11,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob?

1210
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:12,308
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1211
01:28:13,593 --> 01:28:14,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, great.

1212
01:28:14,533 --> 01:28:15,394
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's take this.

1213
01:28:15,674 --> 01:28:16,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, how much lower can we go?

1214
01:28:16,974 --> 01:28:17,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1215
01:28:17,254 --> 01:28:24,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever see that skit on the state where they had the highbrow side and the lowbrow side shifting over to like to the lowbrow?

1216
01:28:24,156 --> 01:28:25,216
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I vaguely remember.

1217
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:25,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1218
01:28:25,616 --> 01:28:26,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1219
01:28:26,957 --> 01:28:28,237
[SPEAKER_04]: The state was a cool show.

1220
01:28:28,457 --> 01:28:30,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the guy who had to put his balls and stuff.

1221
01:28:30,478 --> 01:28:32,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get back to the news, please?

1222
01:28:32,378 --> 01:28:34,359
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're supposed to make the show crappy now.

1223
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:37,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, some gaming news for the love of God.

1224
01:28:37,682 --> 01:28:45,868
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, there is this rumor going around that the next Xbox system will be forwards compatible.

1225
01:28:45,948 --> 01:28:49,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I know you've heard all about backwards compatibility.

1226
01:28:50,152 --> 01:28:52,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, but we got the brand new forwards compatibility.

1227
01:28:52,774 --> 01:28:54,736
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll play the games of the future!

1228
01:28:55,456 --> 01:29:00,178
[SPEAKER_13]: No, really what it means is it will... And I think this technology is already available now.

1229
01:29:00,718 --> 01:29:03,700
[SPEAKER_13]: It will make your Xbox 360 games better.

1230
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:09,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Same, you know, either at a higher resolution or make them play smoother.

1231
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:16,625
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, like the PlayStation... Isn't that the exact same fucking thing the 360 was supposed to do to original Xbox games?

1232
01:29:16,905 --> 01:29:18,326
[SPEAKER_13]: And it does to a certain extent.

1233
01:29:18,526 --> 01:29:21,727
[SPEAKER_13]: It does, you know, smooth out the graphics a little bit.

1234
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:22,988
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also...

1235
01:29:23,888 --> 01:29:24,588
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1236
01:29:46,072 --> 01:29:50,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you the last system that had true forwards compatibility was the Dreamcast, and I'll tell you why.

1237
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:59,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Because with every new game, they would load a new version of Windows CE that would have an improved running environment for each game that came out subsequent.

1238
01:30:00,214 --> 01:30:04,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in that respect, that's forward compatibility.

1239
01:30:04,875 --> 01:30:06,315
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had a system do that since.

1240
01:30:06,455 --> 01:30:15,477
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's also firmware updates, and they have those available now, and with each firmware update, it could make your system run smoother.

1241
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:19,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't it just a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo?

1242
01:30:19,453 --> 01:30:21,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo and rumor!

1243
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:23,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Marketing mumbo jumbo, might I add.

1244
01:30:25,424 --> 01:30:26,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So who cares?

1245
01:30:26,464 --> 01:30:31,966
[SPEAKER_13]: The system isn't going to be out for a while anyways, and we'll listen to all the marketing mumbo-jumbo when that actually happens.

1246
01:30:32,246 --> 01:30:33,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Moral of the story?

1247
01:30:33,827 --> 01:30:34,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega is awesome.

1248
01:30:35,207 --> 01:30:35,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1249
01:30:36,708 --> 01:30:38,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure how we got to that, but okay.

1250
01:30:38,929 --> 01:30:39,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Dreamcast!

1251
01:30:40,449 --> 01:30:45,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's read some comments from chat, because our first half of the show tonight was missing too much of the chat room.

1252
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:47,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get some comments from chat, make up for it, part B here.

1253
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:51,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Redertainment says, Forward's compatibility sounds like new things can be promoted and such.

1254
01:30:52,093 --> 01:30:54,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Backward's compatibility sounds old and dated.

1255
01:30:55,293 --> 01:30:58,916
[SPEAKER_12]: So like with forwards compatibility, Yoda and Vader will already be unlocked.

1256
01:30:59,457 --> 01:30:59,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what it is?

1257
01:31:00,157 --> 01:31:00,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe?

1258
01:31:01,098 --> 01:31:01,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1259
01:31:01,418 --> 01:31:01,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe.

1260
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:02,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1261
01:31:02,139 --> 01:31:03,660
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1262
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,582
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't even know what the hell I'm talking about, dude.

1263
01:31:05,622 --> 01:31:06,963
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like acting right now.

1264
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:07,904
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1265
01:31:08,344 --> 01:31:14,970
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, if you're not watching Justin TV, all Rice Princess and the Doctor are doing are beating each other up on cam for your entertainment.

1266
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:15,570
[SPEAKER_12]: So check that out.

1267
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:16,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we're doing.

1268
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:17,132
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all you're doing.

1269
01:31:17,592 --> 01:31:17,832
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1270
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:20,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, I want to talk about a little bit of news.

1271
01:31:20,073 --> 01:31:22,093
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, this might be something you guys might have an opinion on.

1272
01:31:22,133 --> 01:31:22,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1273
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:24,174
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is not out there yet.

1274
01:31:24,254 --> 01:31:25,634
[SPEAKER_12]: This news is not out there yet.

1275
01:31:25,974 --> 01:31:27,815
[SPEAKER_12]: This actually was my buddy Shane.

1276
01:31:28,255 --> 01:31:30,275
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been on the show here before plenty of times.

1277
01:31:30,315 --> 01:31:31,416
[SPEAKER_12]: He actually works at a game store.

1278
01:31:31,436 --> 01:31:36,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And he sent me a picture from a strategy guide coming out for Fable 2.

1279
01:31:39,516 --> 01:31:53,343
[SPEAKER_12]: There are plenty of quality tailors scattered throughout the cities of Albion, and each of them are capable of crafting some fine handmade clothing.

1280
01:31:54,804 --> 01:32:03,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Many items are unisex, but those that are designed specifically for one sex carry a cross-dressing rating should the other sex wear them.

1281
01:32:04,088 --> 01:32:12,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Heroes wishing to experiment with gender play should consider wearing up clothes of the opposite gender, especially if looking to start a same-sex relationship.

1282
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

1283
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:28,796
[SPEAKER_12]: So, in other words, what I can infer from this, from the strategy guide, is that in Fable 2, if you want to start a same-sex relationship, because you know the game will allow you to basically have whatever types of relationships you want, the way to do that is by cross-dressing.

1284
01:32:29,236 --> 01:32:30,076
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to trick them.

1285
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:32,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wrong.

1286
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,420
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.

1287
01:32:57,432 --> 01:32:58,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody applies logic.

1288
01:32:58,593 --> 01:33:02,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you're gay and you like men, not women.

1289
01:33:02,136 --> 01:33:04,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, why would you... Hello?

1290
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,461
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the epitome of being gay.

1291
01:33:07,601 --> 01:33:07,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello?

1292
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:17,691
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, and maybe I'm just being a little hypersensitive about this, and I'm just, you know, I'm letting the trigger figure go off too soon on this and being offended, but I'm just kind of like, come on, people.

1293
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:18,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this really...

1294
01:33:19,352 --> 01:33:19,792
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1295
01:33:35,899 --> 01:33:36,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's dumb.

1296
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:42,465
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what people think, though, because it's like, oh, well, this one girl in a club was like, oh, do you wear panties?

1297
01:33:42,485 --> 01:33:44,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, I'm not a woman.

1298
01:33:45,228 --> 01:33:46,209
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't wear panties.

1299
01:33:46,529 --> 01:33:47,831
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's what they make mantis for.

1300
01:33:48,051 --> 01:33:49,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, maybe mantis.

1301
01:33:50,173 --> 01:33:51,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Fruit of the Looms are mantis.

1302
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:51,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I don't know.

1303
01:33:51,734 --> 01:33:52,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's...

1304
01:33:54,384 --> 01:34:04,388
[SPEAKER_04]: For all we know, and I don't know how much further into the strategy guide he looked at it, it could be possible that maybe it's just a small start game?

1305
01:34:04,468 --> 01:34:09,730
[SPEAKER_12]: No, apparently later in the guide, each article of clothing actually has a cross-dress rating.

1306
01:34:10,430 --> 01:34:10,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1307
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:12,951
[SPEAKER_12]: So cross-dressing is a facet of the game.

1308
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:14,712
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if it's the guide.

1309
01:34:14,832 --> 01:34:15,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's the game.

1310
01:34:15,972 --> 01:34:18,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming the guide is just reporting on how the game was designed.

1311
01:34:19,174 --> 01:34:19,734
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

1312
01:34:19,774 --> 01:34:22,195
[SPEAKER_12]: But that sentence to me stings.

1313
01:34:22,475 --> 01:34:26,397
[SPEAKER_12]: The way they say that is that if you want to improve your chances in a same-sex relationship, you've got to cross-dress.

1314
01:34:27,757 --> 01:34:29,518
[SPEAKER_04]: They make it sound like that's an integral part of it.

1315
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:33,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Redertainment in chat says, can I attract people of the opposite gender while cross-dressing?

1316
01:34:33,686 --> 01:34:38,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Dude, I know in real life, there's a lot of women that do find that hot, actually.

1317
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:39,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.

1318
01:34:39,831 --> 01:34:41,252
[SPEAKER_10]: A man who's comfortable with their sexuality.

1319
01:34:41,273 --> 01:34:44,215
[SPEAKER_10]: All the teenage guys that go to cosplay dressed as Japanese schoolgirls.

1320
01:34:44,355 --> 01:34:47,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there's a lot of chicks there that get off on that.

1321
01:34:47,878 --> 01:34:51,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost became a cosplay stalker because of this one guy dressed as Utena.

1322
01:34:52,142 --> 01:34:52,582
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1323
01:34:53,002 --> 01:34:54,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And he looked freaking gorgeous.

1324
01:34:55,545 --> 01:34:57,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I'm going to follow you now.

1325
01:34:57,506 --> 01:34:57,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my.

1326
01:34:58,818 --> 01:35:03,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, at least you can have a same-sex relationship in The Sims without cross-dressing.

1327
01:35:04,442 --> 01:35:06,243
[SPEAKER_12]: I think The Sims is a game that does it right.

1328
01:35:07,324 --> 01:35:09,846
[SPEAKER_12]: The game is not about same-sex relationships.

1329
01:35:10,146 --> 01:35:12,688
[SPEAKER_12]: The game does not force you to do same-sex relationships.

1330
01:35:13,028 --> 01:35:14,489
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just there.

1331
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:15,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like in real life.

1332
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:17,211
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just there.

1333
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:19,453
[SPEAKER_10]: In Bully, you have to dress up a little bit.

1334
01:35:19,493 --> 01:35:22,655
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to wear your aqua-berry vest to get a kiss from a guy, but that's not too bad.

1335
01:35:23,981 --> 01:35:26,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at that point, it was just like, we'll take what we can get.

1336
01:35:26,365 --> 01:35:28,268
[SPEAKER_12]: At least there's some representation in this game.

1337
01:35:28,288 --> 01:35:29,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Sauce brought up Manfe.

1338
01:35:31,954 --> 01:35:34,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And she can put Manfe right away.

1339
01:35:34,318 --> 01:35:36,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody is attracted to Manfe.

1340
01:35:38,089 --> 01:35:38,729
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to know.

1341
01:35:38,769 --> 01:35:39,350
[SPEAKER_12]: No, don't, don't.

1342
01:35:39,370 --> 01:35:41,310
[SPEAKER_12]: The doctor just asked, what is Manfei?

1343
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:42,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do much, Cowboy Bebop.

1344
01:35:43,251 --> 01:35:44,051
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he doesn't.

1345
01:35:44,332 --> 01:35:46,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't even bring up the picture, please.

1346
01:35:46,593 --> 01:35:47,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, do it.

1347
01:35:47,813 --> 01:35:48,313
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to.

1348
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a reaction shot.

1349
01:35:49,334 --> 01:35:50,974
[SPEAKER_12]: This is... It's news.

1350
01:35:50,994 --> 01:35:51,555
[SPEAKER_12]: This is radio.

1351
01:35:51,575 --> 01:35:52,175
[SPEAKER_12]: This is news.

1352
01:35:52,215 --> 01:35:55,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you describe what Manfei is while I pull up the picture and chat here, for those of you who don't know?

1353
01:35:55,956 --> 01:36:06,601
[SPEAKER_04]: The character of Fei in Cowboy Bebop has been cosplayed... Yes, a woman has been cosplayed by many pretty women and one hairy man.

1354
01:36:07,856 --> 01:36:08,677
[SPEAKER_04]: That is Manfei.

1355
01:36:09,979 --> 01:36:11,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, share the picture of the chatroom, please.

1356
01:36:14,464 --> 01:36:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Sailor Bubba is a close second.

1357
01:36:16,427 --> 01:36:16,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

1358
01:36:17,108 --> 01:36:17,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

1359
01:36:19,451 --> 01:36:19,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Shudder.

1360
01:36:20,993 --> 01:36:21,593
[SPEAKER_12]: There you have it.

1361
01:36:25,596 --> 01:36:26,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, oh.

1362
01:36:26,496 --> 01:36:30,077
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've been at conventions where Manfe has been present, so.

1363
01:36:30,177 --> 01:36:30,997
[SPEAKER_12]: And see, look, look.

1364
01:36:31,257 --> 01:36:33,397
[SPEAKER_12]: Manfe, we're all sitting here and laughing at.

1365
01:36:33,477 --> 01:36:35,118
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why I don't like this in the game.

1366
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:37,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we sit there and laugh at cross-dressers.

1367
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:37,798
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1368
01:36:37,818 --> 01:36:38,558
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, sometimes we sit.

1369
01:36:38,578 --> 01:36:39,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think that should be associated with same-sex.

1370
01:36:39,838 --> 01:36:41,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because they're obviously doing it for comedic relief.

1371
01:36:41,419 --> 01:36:43,499
[SPEAKER_04]: This one person is cross.

1372
01:36:43,819 --> 01:36:44,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cross-play.

1373
01:36:44,659 --> 01:36:44,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean.

1374
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:46,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Cross-play.

1375
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:46,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

1376
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,020
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's what it's called.

1377
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:47,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's real.

1378
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:51,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, I know plenty of female cosplayers who do male characters.

1379
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,301
[SPEAKER_04]: To comedic effect, I must say.

1380
01:36:54,361 --> 01:36:54,661
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's hot.

1381
01:36:55,956 --> 01:36:57,738
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1382
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Shaoran in chat says, my friend saw Manfe at her first con.

1383
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel so bad for her.

1384
01:37:17,443 --> 01:37:32,594
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, getting away from Manfe and all this funny stuff for right now, going kind of back to the point is that, and this is what I was talking about earlier, DarkSakura, when we were talking about the other story, and I was talking about, it's hard for me to sit here and go, oh, people should not find this offensive, when in the same breath, I'm looking at this story, and I'm going, you know what?

1385
01:37:32,714 --> 01:37:35,556
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of sort of offended at this story.

1386
01:37:35,576 --> 01:37:36,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's different, though.

1387
01:37:37,338 --> 01:37:38,859
[SPEAKER_12]: It is, but I can't put my finger on it.

1388
01:37:38,939 --> 01:37:40,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I be offended

1389
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:48,185
[SPEAKER_04]: The difference being is that this is a specific component integral to the game.

1390
01:37:48,725 --> 01:37:53,368
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something programmed specifically into the game as a facet of gameplay.

1391
01:37:54,088 --> 01:37:59,892
[SPEAKER_04]: The other is background music that was made by someone of that faith.

1392
01:38:02,253 --> 01:38:08,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if that had been programmed in by the most flaming of all gay people ever, would you be as offended?

1393
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:08,637
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1394
01:38:10,069 --> 01:38:11,991
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, because I think that person should know better.

1395
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:19,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but if that person personally thought it was funny and wondered why people would be offended... I mean, I'm not like offended.

1396
01:38:19,937 --> 01:38:20,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Offended is not the word.

1397
01:38:21,178 --> 01:38:22,019
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm disappointed.

1398
01:38:22,499 --> 01:38:30,026
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm disappointed that it's 2008 and this is what I'm reporting on, is that cross-dressing in the game will help your chance of same-sex relationships.

1399
01:38:30,046 --> 01:38:31,787
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just kind of like, can't we just move on?

1400
01:38:32,348 --> 01:38:34,850
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, why can't it just be...

1401
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:43,375
[SPEAKER_12]: If this game wants to be so big about you have the character you want and you program the same way, why can't you just be?

1402
01:38:43,635 --> 01:38:53,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't you just be the hero with muscles and, I don't know, worked out, whatever, wearing manly clothes that attracts a lot of women and 10% of men?

1403
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:54,441
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

1404
01:38:55,421 --> 01:38:56,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't we just have that?

1405
01:38:58,427 --> 01:38:59,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I think it should be?

1406
01:39:00,207 --> 01:39:04,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Because keep in mind also, not everyone who cross-dresses is gay.

1407
01:39:05,310 --> 01:39:05,870
[SPEAKER_04]: We know this.

1408
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:07,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, very, very true.

1409
01:39:07,431 --> 01:39:09,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone who is gay cross-dresses.

1410
01:39:10,152 --> 01:39:11,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, importantly true.

1411
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:12,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1412
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:17,955
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are people, though, who cross-dress because they want to be that gender.

1413
01:39:18,735 --> 01:39:31,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if they were going to incorporate something like that in the game, and true, it would be some very complex programming, I do believe, it should be that you have the option of how you are going to make use of that option.

1414
01:39:31,885 --> 01:39:32,386
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1415
01:39:33,227 --> 01:39:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to cross-dress because you want to be a woman, you should have that as an option.

1416
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:38,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I want boobs.

1417
01:39:39,572 --> 01:39:43,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Solid Goomba in chat says, I want to be a man in a dress and have a relationship with a woman.

1418
01:39:44,436 --> 01:39:45,237
[SPEAKER_12]: More power to you.

1419
01:39:45,617 --> 01:39:48,499
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think the game should allow that if that's what you want.

1420
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:49,721
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I mean?

1421
01:39:49,741 --> 01:39:51,402
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think cross-dressing should have a bearing on it.

1422
01:39:51,442 --> 01:39:51,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1423
01:39:51,742 --> 01:39:52,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'm just...

1424
01:39:53,459 --> 01:39:53,939
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1425
01:40:12,327 --> 01:40:13,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just kind of getting sick of it.

1426
01:40:13,888 --> 01:40:20,211
[SPEAKER_12]: One of these days I would just like to have a normal person who happens to be gay in my video game.

1427
01:40:20,671 --> 01:40:22,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Just like in TV and all that.

1428
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:26,675
[SPEAKER_12]: If sexuality is not a part of the game's device at all, then fine.

1429
01:40:26,775 --> 01:40:28,496
[SPEAKER_12]: We have no defined sexuality in the game.

1430
01:40:28,516 --> 01:40:29,396
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just fine by me.

1431
01:40:29,716 --> 01:40:36,140
[SPEAKER_12]: But amongst these RPG love stories, I would like one day for there to be a same-gender one that is not stupid.

1432
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,763
[SPEAKER_04]: if that makes sense.

1433
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:48,477
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually goes back to what I was talking about about the sort of singular directional bigotry, you know what I mean?

1434
01:40:49,659 --> 01:40:50,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that

1435
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:56,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Every relationship is going to have its moments of dysfunction.

1436
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:01,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Some may have a very odd origin.

1437
01:41:01,448 --> 01:41:02,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I ordered my husband on the internet.

1438
01:41:04,551 --> 01:41:14,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if it's going to have a quirk to it, the quirk should be there because of the people involved, not because of their orientation, right?

1439
01:41:16,832 --> 01:41:17,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, go ahead.

1440
01:41:17,693 --> 01:41:18,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one other thing, though.

1441
01:41:19,214 --> 01:41:26,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, though, that having an active... I don't even think it should be an active choice.

1442
01:41:26,378 --> 01:41:29,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should just start up your character and be born gay or not.

1443
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:30,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really, isn't that...

1444
01:41:32,081 --> 01:41:34,542
[SPEAKER_04]: For the most part, I think it's genetic.

1445
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:36,823
[SPEAKER_04]: But I digress.

1446
01:41:38,364 --> 01:41:44,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that as far as it being a part, that does determine a lot of who your character is.

1447
01:41:45,407 --> 01:41:48,869
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does not define who your character is.

1448
01:41:50,057 --> 01:41:50,898
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1449
01:42:12,932 --> 01:42:13,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough.

1450
01:42:13,632 --> 01:42:15,633
[SPEAKER_12]: But how often does religion come into video games?

1451
01:42:15,853 --> 01:42:20,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, then again, saying all that with what we talked about earlier.

1452
01:42:22,856 --> 01:42:27,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And then immediately follows that up and says, just because they always grab coins doesn't mean they're Jewish.

1453
01:42:29,919 --> 01:42:31,300
[SPEAKER_12]: See, I like that you can have a little fun with it.

1454
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario's Catholic, you know that.

1455
01:42:32,921 --> 01:42:34,022
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that you can have a little fun with it.

1456
01:42:34,343 --> 01:42:37,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, look, let's just move on.

1457
01:42:38,145 --> 01:42:40,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody's talking about they want to see representation of themselves.

1458
01:42:40,367 --> 01:42:42,769
[SPEAKER_12]: GS68, I want more Filipino-Filipina characters, dammit.

1459
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:46,652
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure there's a lot of people saying I want to see a little more of this in games.

1460
01:42:46,832 --> 01:42:50,174
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe it's time for diversity the game.

1461
01:42:50,234 --> 01:42:50,635
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1462
01:42:50,735 --> 01:42:51,936
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a small world, the game.

1463
01:42:52,176 --> 01:42:52,516
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

1464
01:42:53,197 --> 01:42:53,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1465
01:42:53,717 --> 01:42:54,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move on.

1466
01:42:54,478 --> 01:42:56,039
[SPEAKER_12]: There's plenty more gaming news to talk about.

1467
01:42:56,179 --> 01:42:57,840
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to talk more about it, email us.

1468
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:58,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Call us later.

1469
01:42:59,181 --> 01:42:59,761
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.

1470
01:43:01,622 --> 01:43:04,622
[SPEAKER_12]: Take us to a game that has nothing to do with sexuality, religion, or race at all.

1471
01:43:05,802 --> 01:43:07,363
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's about falling into holes.

1472
01:43:08,543 --> 01:43:10,183
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be construed as sexuality.

1473
01:43:11,604 --> 01:43:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but how many holes do people really fall into?

1474
01:43:13,704 --> 01:43:15,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sometimes... Oops, I tripped.

1475
01:43:15,124 --> 01:43:15,824
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a vagina.

1476
01:43:16,045 --> 01:43:18,285
[SPEAKER_12]: You might wake up with a hangover.

1477
01:43:18,325 --> 01:43:20,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I fell into a hole while I was drunk.

1478
01:43:20,585 --> 01:43:20,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, sorry.

1479
01:43:21,006 --> 01:43:21,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1480
01:43:21,666 --> 01:43:22,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway.

1481
01:43:22,886 --> 01:43:27,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Portal Still Alive is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.

1482
01:43:29,523 --> 01:43:33,385
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be up on Wednesday, October 22nd.

1483
01:43:34,185 --> 01:43:47,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has the one that came out earlier plus 14 new exclusive challenge maps and 6 advanced maps and new achievements.

1484
01:43:48,272 --> 01:43:53,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So in other words, if you bought the orange box just for this game, haha sucker, you're going to buy it twice.

1485
01:43:54,365 --> 01:43:57,006
[SPEAKER_12]: But is Portal a game that you really mind buying twice?

1486
01:43:57,126 --> 01:43:58,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it is pretty freaking good.

1487
01:43:58,406 --> 01:44:00,066
[SPEAKER_12]: There are different levels, to be fair.

1488
01:44:00,086 --> 01:44:00,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, to be fair.

1489
01:44:01,026 --> 01:44:01,266
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1490
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:03,507
[SPEAKER_13]: There needs to be more GLaDOS.

1491
01:44:03,747 --> 01:44:04,207
[SPEAKER_12]: On the PC.

1492
01:44:06,527 --> 01:44:08,348
[SPEAKER_04]: First there will be cake, and then you will be baked.

1493
01:44:09,168 --> 01:44:11,288
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's no story in the extra levels, right?

1494
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:12,028
[SPEAKER_12]: They're just kind of there.

1495
01:44:12,048 --> 01:44:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just more crazy.

1496
01:44:13,088 --> 01:44:16,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Will you be taunted by GLaDOS in these bonus levels, or are they just extra puzzles or something?

1497
01:44:17,169 --> 01:44:18,569
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point of not being taunted?

1498
01:44:19,089 --> 01:44:19,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1499
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:21,550
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why I'm curious to see how...

1500
01:44:23,996 --> 01:44:25,537
[SPEAKER_12]: How milked is this game?

1501
01:44:25,717 --> 01:44:26,698
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I want to see.

1502
01:44:26,738 --> 01:44:29,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they really just milking it, or did they actually put a little thought into it?

1503
01:44:30,101 --> 01:44:31,822
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I'm really curious to see.

1504
01:44:33,802 --> 01:45:01,705
[SPEAKER_13]: who knows well one thing that you can probably store that brand new game on would be a hard drive or a new memory unit and remember Microsoft was saying with the new Xbox experience that you would need some sort of storage device in order to download it because it does take 128 megs of space well their solution for people that I don't know how they went about existing with an Xbox with no storage whatsoever because that means you can't save games or anything

1505
01:45:03,666 --> 01:45:10,671
[SPEAKER_13]: They are offering a free 512MB memory unit, or for $20 you can buy a 20GB hard drive.

1506
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:17,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, in order to qualify for this, you have to have a core system, or some arcade systems may qualify as well.

1507
01:45:18,456 --> 01:45:29,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, just go to their website, they have available for that, which is xbox.com, go to their support page, and there's a memory update thing where you enter your

1508
01:45:34,148 --> 01:45:35,870
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're eligible, they'll let you buy them.

1509
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:40,156
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not eligible and you happen to have an arcade system, that's the other option.

1510
01:45:40,657 --> 01:45:43,982
[SPEAKER_13]: For $29.99, you can get a 20GB hard drive and a 3-month live card.

1511
01:45:44,582 --> 01:45:46,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is not a bad deal either.

1512
01:45:47,707 --> 01:45:48,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's my question.

1513
01:45:50,489 --> 01:45:52,810
[SPEAKER_12]: When I got my Xbox 360, I have a core.

1514
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:56,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I got my system during that time when Xbox 360s were really hard to find.

1515
01:45:57,132 --> 01:46:02,473
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just ponied up the 20 extra dollars or whatever it was to buy the hard drive and the core system separately.

1516
01:46:02,754 --> 01:46:05,434
[SPEAKER_12]: So is Microsoft going to know that I've had a hard drive this whole time?

1517
01:46:05,494 --> 01:46:07,775
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's all by the console ID number.

1518
01:46:07,815 --> 01:46:08,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Sweet!

1519
01:46:08,535 --> 01:46:09,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I get a free memory card!

1520
01:46:09,816 --> 01:46:10,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Right?

1521
01:46:11,096 --> 01:46:11,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1522
01:46:11,637 --> 01:46:11,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome!

1523
01:46:11,997 --> 01:46:12,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Just put it in your...

1524
01:46:13,237 --> 01:46:14,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good on your device.

1525
01:46:14,258 --> 01:46:14,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not?

1526
01:46:14,619 --> 01:46:15,039
[SPEAKER_12]: It's free.

1527
01:46:15,660 --> 01:46:17,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft doesn't know that I have a hard drive.

1528
01:46:17,862 --> 01:46:24,949
[SPEAKER_12]: And even though I do, why should I be treated differently from the other owners that bought the core early on, early adopters?

1529
01:46:25,369 --> 01:46:26,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1530
01:46:27,351 --> 01:46:29,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, for 20 bucks you can get a 20 gig hard drive.

1531
01:46:30,434 --> 01:46:33,818
[SPEAKER_12]: That could just be the drive I install Final Fantasy XI on and never use.

1532
01:46:36,627 --> 01:46:44,857
[SPEAKER_12]: or it could be, or better yet, it could be because I only have a 20 gig hard drive as it is now, I could have two drives and one of them can be like the movie's drive and the other one can be the game's drive.

1533
01:46:45,257 --> 01:46:45,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not?

1534
01:46:46,459 --> 01:46:50,484
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think, to be honest, I think that's an awesome solution for their problem.

1535
01:46:51,185 --> 01:46:52,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And really, I mean...

1536
01:46:54,135 --> 01:46:55,376
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1537
01:47:10,137 --> 01:47:10,878
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not.

1538
01:47:10,918 --> 01:47:11,258
[SPEAKER_13]: No, hold on.

1539
01:47:34,454 --> 01:47:39,916
[SPEAKER_12]: and HendersonManInChat says, Sky, I have a core, but it would not let me have a free memory card, so somehow they know.

1540
01:47:40,236 --> 01:47:41,337
[SPEAKER_12]: That's from HendersonManInChat.

1541
01:47:41,617 --> 01:47:42,937
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's going to, eh.

1542
01:47:43,097 --> 01:47:44,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm really curious.

1543
01:47:44,398 --> 01:47:44,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to try it.

1544
01:47:44,958 --> 01:47:46,138
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll let you guys know what happens next week.

1545
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:48,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I've got about five different ones we can try.

1546
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:50,700
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see what happens.

1547
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,321
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

1548
01:47:52,621 --> 01:47:58,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I want to get a bigger hard drive, but if I can get a 20 gig hard drive, another one for cheap, I'll do that switch out idea.

1549
01:47:58,203 --> 01:47:59,063
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a great idea.

1550
01:48:00,444 --> 01:48:00,944
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see.

1551
01:48:02,748 --> 01:48:06,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, thank you Microsoft for giving us some free stuff, right?

1552
01:48:07,469 --> 01:48:07,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yes!

1553
01:48:23,072 --> 01:48:32,174
[SPEAKER_12]: They're trying to increase the amount of compatibility that occurs between the two, with the media sharing and the things that go on between the 360 and the Zune.

1554
01:48:32,614 --> 01:48:39,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, recently, some folks over at Gizmodo were talking about the new Gears of War Zune that's coming out.

1555
01:48:39,335 --> 01:48:42,216
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were actually talking to Microsoft's marketing director.

1556
01:48:42,836 --> 01:48:50,838
[SPEAKER_12]: And the marketing director was talking about that there is going to be a big step-up happening in the Zune 360 integration within a year.

1557
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:52,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's all.

1558
01:48:52,953 --> 01:48:57,656
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very vague statement, but that supposedly it's going to step it up within a year.

1559
01:48:58,076 --> 01:49:00,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Any thoughts as to what that could possibly be?

1560
01:49:00,438 --> 01:49:03,901
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they already have the X and A support that's supposed to be coming to it.

1561
01:49:03,941 --> 01:49:05,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe they're going to flesh that out a little bit more.

1562
01:49:06,222 --> 01:49:09,244
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe it would be kind of cool if they actually put some games on there.

1563
01:49:09,705 --> 01:49:16,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, they could even be like the Pocket Station stuff where you play a little mini game and you earn points for a game or something.

1564
01:49:16,029 --> 01:49:17,610
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a thought, and I bet money I'm right.

1565
01:49:18,311 --> 01:49:18,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Movies.

1566
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:18,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Movies.

1567
01:49:19,983 --> 01:49:23,764
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going to be able to play movies on the Zune that you bought on Xbox.

1568
01:49:23,804 --> 01:49:24,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see that happening.

1569
01:49:24,924 --> 01:49:26,785
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be how they're going to compete with iPod.

1570
01:49:26,825 --> 01:49:30,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, remember when they were talking about the Zune E3?

1571
01:49:31,326 --> 01:49:31,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

1572
01:49:31,826 --> 01:49:36,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And didn't they bring up something to that effect that it would be like a multi-entertainment?

1573
01:49:37,948 --> 01:49:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember going in there with my camera and then telling you to turn it off at the Xbox 360 thing, and they were talking about having portable content.

1574
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:48,651
[SPEAKER_04]: So perhaps this is what they intended.

1575
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:48,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1576
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:52,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Cobra Kid says more XNA games to it in chat.

1577
01:49:52,474 --> 01:49:52,814
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

1578
01:49:52,854 --> 01:49:54,637
[SPEAKER_12]: They have that whole XNA thing coming out soon.

1579
01:49:54,858 --> 01:49:55,979
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be a big part of it too.

1580
01:49:56,059 --> 01:49:56,841
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe it's all of it.

1581
01:49:57,542 --> 01:50:01,848
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be just as much as the iPhone interfaces with your Mac or even your personal computer.

1582
01:50:01,868 --> 01:50:03,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the Zoom will interface with the Xbox 360.

1583
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:03,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

1584
01:50:06,892 --> 01:50:08,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Will there be enough people that use it?

1585
01:50:09,034 --> 01:50:10,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Or just a quick question in chat.

1586
01:50:10,875 --> 01:50:13,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say the Zune could do all of those things you suggested.

1587
01:50:13,798 --> 01:50:15,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say the Zune can do the XNA games.

1588
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say the Zune can do the movies and all that stuff.

1589
01:50:19,143 --> 01:50:20,505
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you be interested in a Zune?

1590
01:50:20,825 --> 01:50:21,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Chat room.

1591
01:50:22,689 --> 01:50:25,092
[SPEAKER_12]: As opposed to an iPhone or any of the other stuff that's out there.

1592
01:50:25,112 --> 01:50:26,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say you can only have one player.

1593
01:50:26,293 --> 01:50:27,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you pick Zune?

1594
01:50:28,435 --> 01:50:29,336
[SPEAKER_12]: Comment from Tigerclaw.

1595
01:50:29,677 --> 01:50:31,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Tigerclaw says, doesn't Zune have built-in Wi-Fi?

1596
01:50:31,919 --> 01:50:32,840
[SPEAKER_12]: They could make apps for it.

1597
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:37,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, for example, someone would eventually make an internet radio app to tune into the shoutcast streams over the Wi-Fi.

1598
01:50:39,207 --> 01:50:39,547
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1599
01:50:40,488 --> 01:50:43,832
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll come back to that story just after we get this next story out of the way.

1600
01:50:45,293 --> 01:51:15,002
[SPEAKER_04]: this actually makes me a little bit happy even though I already own the game on multiple platforms Marvel vs. Capcom 2 which honestly I thought the first one was a little bit better but it actually has an ESRB rating now for PS3 and Xbox 360 so that leads speculation that it's going to be a downloadable version maybe like a Xbox Live Arcade or something like that

1601
01:51:15,322 --> 01:51:16,044
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's pretty cool.

1602
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:17,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a good game.

1603
01:51:17,647 --> 01:51:18,709
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm looking forward to that.

1604
01:51:18,949 --> 01:51:20,953
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fucking awesome game, you mean, by good.

1605
01:51:21,474 --> 01:51:22,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought the first one was better.

1606
01:51:23,579 --> 01:51:23,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair enough.

1607
01:51:25,562 --> 01:51:27,186
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about playing a strider here, you anyway.

1608
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:31,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, looking at chatroom comments from the last story because we asked you guys, would you get one?

1609
01:51:32,131 --> 01:51:35,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And would you get a Zune if they implemented all these features?

1610
01:51:35,433 --> 01:51:37,033
[SPEAKER_12]: VXJSNXV says, Zunes blow?

1611
01:51:37,533 --> 01:51:38,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma says, yes.

1612
01:51:39,014 --> 01:51:41,615
[SPEAKER_12]: GameGuru says, maybe, but I'm more interested in PSP right now.

1613
01:51:41,935 --> 01:51:43,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Shaoran says, sure, why not?

1614
01:51:43,936 --> 01:51:46,437
[SPEAKER_12]: VXJSNXV continues, I have my iPhone and I'm happy with it.

1615
01:51:46,877 --> 01:51:49,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Redertainment says, does it do much better than my current touch?

1616
01:51:49,838 --> 01:51:50,598
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, no.

1617
01:51:50,698 --> 01:51:52,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I need a gross incentive to jump over.

1618
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:53,319
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how I feel.

1619
01:51:53,519 --> 01:51:56,581
[SPEAKER_12]: There's got to be something really big to get me to have a Zune as well as an iPhone.

1620
01:51:57,921 --> 01:51:59,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Cobra Kid says I would have to get a bigger Zune.

1621
01:52:01,442 --> 01:52:04,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Deakman says I'm telling you they'll merge the music card and the gamer tag.

1622
01:52:05,203 --> 01:52:05,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't even think of that.

1623
01:52:05,963 --> 01:52:06,363
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be.

1624
01:52:07,064 --> 01:52:07,524
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see.

1625
01:52:08,544 --> 01:52:08,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1626
01:52:09,865 --> 01:52:13,145
[SPEAKER_12]: So Marvel vs. Capcom 2 hopefully coming soon as it says.

1627
01:52:13,746 --> 01:52:14,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Meanwhile, some other news.

1628
01:52:18,291 --> 01:52:18,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, Loki?

1629
01:52:19,152 --> 01:52:19,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1630
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, someone was stepping on my mic.

1631
01:52:22,397 --> 01:52:23,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Are our guests being unruly?

1632
01:52:24,019 --> 01:52:25,161
[SPEAKER_12]: They are being very unruly.

1633
01:52:25,181 --> 01:52:26,583
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they need to be punished?

1634
01:52:26,803 --> 01:52:28,846
[SPEAKER_10]: We're playing Naughty Tic-Tac-Toe.

1635
01:52:29,907 --> 01:52:31,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, um,

1636
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:38,093
[SPEAKER_13]: If you live in Europe, you're going to be in for a lot of holiday bundles for the Xbox 360.

1637
01:52:39,074 --> 01:52:43,016
[SPEAKER_13]: They are getting quite a few, in fact, starting last week, actually.

1638
01:52:44,236 --> 01:52:48,939
[SPEAKER_13]: The value packs that are available pretty much all around the world will be available for them as well.

1639
01:52:49,039 --> 01:52:52,661
[SPEAKER_13]: That includes, of course, the games packed in LEGO Indiana Jones Kung Fu Panda for both

1640
01:52:53,001 --> 01:52:59,883
[SPEAKER_13]: The Elite and Pro, and the Sega Superstar Tennis, and of course the Xbox Live Arcade Games.

1641
01:53:00,944 --> 01:53:16,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Starting, looks like, November 7th, they're going to be getting two more bundles, both with the 60GB Pro system and either Gears of War 2 bundled in, or James Bond 007 Quantum of Solace bundled in.

1642
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:18,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are going to both be available for 269 euros.

1643
01:53:22,012 --> 01:53:27,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Starting the 21st of November, there's going to be another one with Tomb Raider Underworld.

1644
01:53:28,537 --> 01:53:33,621
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's also a pro system, the 60GB, with a 1200 Microsoft Points card.

1645
01:53:34,021 --> 01:53:35,563
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's also available for 269 euros.

1646
01:53:35,583 --> 01:53:45,330
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, the last-ditch effort before Christmas, there's another 60GB pro system bundled with Prince of Persia.

1647
01:53:46,051 --> 01:53:47,192
[SPEAKER_13]: And that will also be for 269 euros.

1648
01:53:47,212 --> 01:53:47,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

1649
01:53:51,135 --> 01:53:55,016
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit more expensive than your normal games, your normal pro system.

1650
01:53:55,896 --> 01:53:59,717
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, basically, you're kind of paying for the game itself anyways.

1651
01:54:01,337 --> 01:54:03,938
[SPEAKER_13]: But hey, that's kind of neat, I guess, if you're shopping for the holidays.

1652
01:54:05,878 --> 01:54:07,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots and lots to pick from.

1653
01:54:07,559 --> 01:54:09,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think so many bundles over there are supposed to here?

1654
01:54:10,359 --> 01:54:16,821
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it may have been just, you know, and I'm not even sure if it's actually... It could very well be like different...

1655
01:54:18,137 --> 01:54:19,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1656
01:54:29,895 --> 01:54:31,156
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1657
01:54:53,557 --> 01:54:54,658
[SPEAKER_12]: on certification from Microsoft.

1658
01:54:54,678 --> 01:55:01,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, they are currently verifying the updates and then they're going to be sending it off to Microsoft for certification, which has probably already happened.

1659
01:55:02,506 --> 01:55:04,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of took them long enough in a way.

1660
01:55:04,087 --> 01:55:09,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, with as long as this game took to come out, I mean, couldn't they just kind of like fix this before it came out?

1661
01:55:09,532 --> 01:55:10,193
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I don't know.

1662
01:55:10,233 --> 01:55:11,753
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, you know, they didn't know.

1663
01:55:11,873 --> 01:55:12,634
[SPEAKER_12]: They tested the game.

1664
01:55:12,654 --> 01:55:13,414
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't find it.

1665
01:55:13,454 --> 01:55:14,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Mistakes happen.

1666
01:55:14,255 --> 01:55:14,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Blah, blah, blah.

1667
01:55:15,155 --> 01:55:16,236
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a little bit frustrating.

1668
01:55:16,256 --> 01:55:19,918
[SPEAKER_12]: This game's been out how long and you still can't really have a multiplayer game on it.

1669
01:55:20,318 --> 01:55:23,900
[SPEAKER_12]: But I guess to their credit, you know, a lot of people bought this game anyway.

1670
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:29,243
[SPEAKER_12]: And hearing about this patch is just going to cause another wave of people running out to get this game.

1671
01:55:29,544 --> 01:55:34,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas a lot of Xbox Live Arcade titles kind of have one shot the week they come out and then they kind of slip into obscurity.

1672
01:55:35,327 --> 01:55:37,868
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe it was pre-planned.

1673
01:55:37,928 --> 01:55:38,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

1674
01:55:38,569 --> 01:55:39,089
[SPEAKER_12]: I doubt it, though.

1675
01:55:40,356 --> 01:55:40,616
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1676
01:55:41,636 --> 01:55:48,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, something pre-planned on Orange Lounge Radio is that every week we are going to take some time to read your emails that you send us to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1677
01:55:49,438 --> 01:55:50,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are you boycotting the mailbag?

1678
01:55:51,258 --> 01:55:51,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookie.

1679
01:55:52,378 --> 01:55:54,539
[SPEAKER_12]: I will get you a damn cookie if you read the emails.

1680
01:55:54,859 --> 01:55:59,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Fart Princess, Doctor, do you guys want... I have flat fortune cookies.

1681
01:55:59,099 --> 01:56:00,200
[SPEAKER_03]: They taste like pancakes.

1682
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:01,440
[SPEAKER_12]: They taste like pancakes.

1683
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:02,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want one.

1684
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:02,480
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1685
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:03,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my.

1686
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:03,860
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I'll get some.

1687
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:05,580
[SPEAKER_12]: While DarkSakura reads us some email.

1688
01:56:12,018 --> 01:56:15,200
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an email that I should have sent in response to you directly, Rob.

1689
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if I should read it on air.

1690
01:56:18,122 --> 01:56:21,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you read this first, then I'm going to have to wait on the cookies.

1691
01:56:22,344 --> 01:56:23,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you can just read it at your leisure.

1692
01:56:24,385 --> 01:56:26,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, give me a brief idea what it's about.

1693
01:56:26,286 --> 01:56:28,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Spazinator.

1694
01:56:28,788 --> 01:56:29,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1695
01:56:29,588 --> 01:56:31,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Telling you what games you should get for PS3.

1696
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:40,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, didn't I say... I think I said a while back about something like I need more games that I should... Yeah.

1697
01:56:40,295 --> 01:56:40,835
[SPEAKER_12]: What games?

1698
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:52,505
[SPEAKER_04]: LocoRoco, Cocorecho, Lemmings, Elefunk, EchoChrome, WipeoutHD, Everyday Shooter, SuperPuzzleFight Are you farting glasses?

1699
01:56:52,525 --> 01:56:54,966
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing?

1700
01:56:56,686 --> 01:56:57,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Knock it off.

1701
01:56:57,747 --> 01:56:58,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to do a show.

1702
01:56:58,407 --> 01:56:59,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, those games.

1703
01:57:00,068 --> 01:57:04,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, so they just list every game that happens to be exclusive?

1704
01:57:04,089 --> 01:57:05,410
[SPEAKER_12]: A list of 36 games, Rob.

1705
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:07,831
[SPEAKER_12]: So just basically all the PlayStation 3 exclusives?

1706
01:57:08,832 --> 01:57:10,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, some.

1707
01:57:11,153 --> 01:57:11,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Some or not.

1708
01:57:11,713 --> 01:57:13,995
[SPEAKER_12]: To be fair, I'm going to get a PlayStation 3.

1709
01:57:14,435 --> 01:57:16,836
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just LittleBigPlanet's out sooner rather than later.

1710
01:57:16,856 --> 01:57:18,217
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll probably happen this week.

1711
01:57:18,437 --> 01:57:22,018
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more tips on what else you should get along with and what you should look for.

1712
01:57:22,619 --> 01:57:28,461
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm having surgery soon, so, you know, probably having a Blu-ray player will be a good thing while I recover.

1713
01:57:30,983 --> 01:57:33,604
[SPEAKER_12]: So, let's go on to the next email while I go get the cookies.

1714
01:57:33,984 --> 01:57:37,466
[SPEAKER_04]: The next email is actually from...

1715
01:57:39,680 --> 01:57:40,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart Heart Heart

1716
01:58:12,106 --> 01:58:20,394
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, we only really have one other email.

1717
01:58:21,813 --> 01:58:27,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and it's actually from, um, Dan Shadow.

1718
01:58:27,756 --> 01:58:31,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hey guys, my nephew's birthday was last week so I missed the show.

1719
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:36,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Took him to the movie of his choice and he chose, wait for it, quarantine.

1720
01:58:36,681 --> 01:58:38,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it sucked so bad.

1721
01:58:38,582 --> 01:58:42,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was so bad that people would start talking during the movie and no one cared.

1722
01:58:43,085 --> 01:58:43,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking rabies.

1723
01:58:45,146 --> 01:58:49,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, been trying to catch up on my OLR since I had to leave in the middle of another episode.

1724
01:58:50,427 --> 01:58:57,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Just got one episode on Friday and I'm sure... I guess you meant to have the word... Rob?

1725
01:58:58,610 --> 01:58:59,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on the last email.

1726
01:59:00,450 --> 01:59:00,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob's gay.

1727
01:59:04,451 --> 01:59:05,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure I'll get the other one soon.

1728
01:59:06,372 --> 01:59:07,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Been playing Dead Space this week.

1729
01:59:07,792 --> 01:59:10,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend it to anyone who has a good sound setup.

1730
01:59:11,133 --> 01:59:11,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1731
01:59:11,693 --> 01:59:12,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, quickie.

1732
01:59:13,902 --> 01:59:17,644
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as scary visually as much as it is audibly.

1733
01:59:19,105 --> 01:59:23,908
[SPEAKER_04]: The visuals are great, they're just not as scary as the EA's been telling all of us.

1734
01:59:24,729 --> 01:59:26,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, can you believe the news this week?

1735
01:59:26,189 --> 01:59:30,212
[SPEAKER_04]: LittleBigPlanet gets delayed, Ghostbusters gets picked back up, and Obama's appearing in video games.

1736
01:59:30,632 --> 01:59:32,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't a caller bring that up a few weeks ago?

1737
01:59:32,893 --> 01:59:35,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and before I forget, Ballhair says hi.

1738
01:59:36,095 --> 01:59:38,096
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a last name now and he's doing well.

1739
01:59:38,156 --> 01:59:43,579
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a guild and we're at guild level 14 at this moment and we're talking keeps.

1740
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:45,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're taking keeps.

1741
01:59:46,160 --> 01:59:47,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Ballhair Jenkins?

1742
01:59:47,261 --> 01:59:47,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh wait, no.

1743
01:59:47,641 --> 01:59:49,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Ballhair was a Warhammer character, right?

1744
01:59:50,323 --> 01:59:50,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm looking.

1745
01:59:51,003 --> 01:59:53,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1746
01:59:53,724 --> 01:59:54,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Ballhair Trimmer.

1747
01:59:55,305 --> 01:59:56,066
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dawnbringer.

1748
01:59:57,126 --> 01:59:57,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Nice.

1749
01:59:57,867 --> 01:59:58,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1750
01:59:58,887 --> 01:59:59,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Ballhair Trimmer.

1751
01:59:59,768 --> 02:00:00,508
[SPEAKER_12]: That's lovely.

1752
02:00:01,048 --> 02:00:01,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1753
02:00:02,309 --> 02:00:03,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ballhair got a guild.

1754
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:03,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Congratulations.

1755
02:00:06,752 --> 02:00:07,632
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it for email?

1756
02:00:08,412 --> 02:00:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1757
02:00:10,153 --> 02:00:11,233
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one from Redertainment.

1758
02:00:11,833 --> 02:00:12,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Less email, more cookie?

1759
02:00:13,174 --> 02:00:13,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

1760
02:00:13,654 --> 02:00:14,034
[SPEAKER_12]: One more email.

1761
02:00:14,054 --> 02:00:14,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating cookie.

1762
02:00:14,834 --> 02:00:15,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1763
02:00:15,934 --> 02:00:17,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is actually in response.

1764
02:00:17,615 --> 02:00:19,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were CC'd on this, so I'm gonna read it.

1765
02:00:19,275 --> 02:00:19,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1766
02:00:22,096 --> 02:00:23,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought... This is from Redertainment.

1767
02:00:24,376 --> 02:00:29,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought LittleBigPlanet on Friday and found out about the recall right before I sent this message.

1768
02:00:30,498 --> 02:00:33,899
[SPEAKER_04]: What the expletive deleted for Bobby, fuck for OLR, should I do?

1769
02:00:35,131 --> 02:00:39,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I contact Sony, wait for a patch, or keep the game as a collector's item and buy another copy?

1770
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:41,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your time.

1771
02:00:59,628 --> 02:01:03,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, he probably already did because he didn't know about the change.

1772
02:01:04,309 --> 02:01:05,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Just hang on to it.

1773
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:11,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Sony's going to patch it out anyway, so you're not going to really have a choice because they're doing both, but the serial number on that box will make... Unless you want to disconnect yourself from the internet.

1774
02:01:12,312 --> 02:01:15,793
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be like those pennies that have, like, the misprint on the back.

1775
02:01:15,973 --> 02:01:16,953
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, those type of things.

1776
02:01:16,973 --> 02:01:17,533
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it's going to be.

1777
02:01:18,574 --> 02:01:22,795
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play your copy that's been unedited, then disconnect from the internet.

1778
02:01:24,976 --> 02:01:28,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Red Entertainment's in chat right now and says he already opened it because how would he know that it was going to be recalled?

1779
02:01:29,017 --> 02:01:29,157
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

1780
02:01:30,697 --> 02:01:31,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't say I blame you there.

1781
02:01:32,178 --> 02:01:32,778
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, let's get back.

1782
02:01:32,818 --> 02:01:33,679
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's it for Mailbag.

1783
02:01:33,899 --> 02:01:34,259
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

1784
02:01:34,499 --> 02:01:36,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1785
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:40,482
[SPEAKER_12]: While we chow down on cookies, Loki the cookie hater will bring us back to some gaming news.

1786
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:41,123
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one more thing.

1787
02:01:41,603 --> 02:01:43,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow, I hit myself in the face with the microphone.

1788
02:01:43,524 --> 02:01:44,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that the thing?

1789
02:01:45,405 --> 02:01:46,085
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

1790
02:01:46,485 --> 02:01:46,686
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1791
02:01:48,266 --> 02:01:58,372
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one thing that I every so often will get an email on and didn't this time, and I meant to plug it during my Classic Game of the Week, was a review done by Sauce.

1792
02:01:59,864 --> 02:02:01,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes, I was reading about this on Twitter.

1793
02:02:02,446 --> 02:02:03,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am getting the link now.

1794
02:02:04,308 --> 02:02:08,251
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to twitter.com slash Mar and Marvel, there is a link to it.

1795
02:02:09,171 --> 02:02:13,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And her review of the week is ActRaiser, her classic game review.

1796
02:02:14,396 --> 02:02:15,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, isn't it great?

1797
02:02:16,037 --> 02:02:19,059
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had an exclamation of, I love ActRaiser.

1798
02:02:20,160 --> 02:02:21,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So go look at it.

1799
02:02:21,301 --> 02:02:22,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm linking it in the chat room.

1800
02:02:23,323 --> 02:02:24,304
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll link it on our Twitter.

1801
02:02:24,824 --> 02:02:26,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Irene's god name in ActRaiser is...

1802
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:30,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Actraiser.

1803
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:30,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Actraiser.

1804
02:02:30,871 --> 02:02:31,272
[SPEAKER_05]: How funny.

1805
02:02:31,312 --> 02:02:33,494
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I named Link in Legend of Zelda was poop.

1806
02:02:34,275 --> 02:02:34,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1807
02:02:34,635 --> 02:02:35,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Copycat.

1808
02:02:35,656 --> 02:02:37,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I named him GGG because I was lazy.

1809
02:02:39,180 --> 02:02:39,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1810
02:02:39,901 --> 02:02:41,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I named him Zelda so I could get the extra.

1811
02:02:41,763 --> 02:02:42,123
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1812
02:02:42,664 --> 02:02:42,944
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1813
02:02:43,565 --> 02:02:44,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Back to news.

1814
02:02:44,646 --> 02:02:45,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Cookie Hater.

1815
02:02:46,417 --> 02:02:52,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, well, there is some controversy around another game, Saints Row 2.

1816
02:02:52,939 --> 02:02:58,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, New York police unions condemn Saints Row 2 because, well, you kill policemen in the game.

1817
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:09,322
[SPEAKER_13]: And according to them, New York's powerful police unions say that a violent new video game called Saints Row 2 is an abomination.

1818
02:03:09,843 --> 02:03:15,884
[SPEAKER_13]: In the game, the players control a gang member who can steal, do drugs, kill as many characters as possible, including...

1819
02:03:16,404 --> 02:03:17,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1820
02:03:29,315 --> 02:03:30,335
[SPEAKER_13]: College Students.

1821
02:03:31,095 --> 02:03:35,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we hear any unions for college students coming out, you know, saying this game sucks?

1822
02:03:35,596 --> 02:03:36,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a college student and I'm offended.

1823
02:03:38,917 --> 02:03:40,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Or taxi drivers or rednecks.

1824
02:03:41,037 --> 02:03:43,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Do unions for students exist?

1825
02:03:43,238 --> 02:03:45,038
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like a paying job.

1826
02:03:45,198 --> 02:03:47,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that makes sense, huh?

1827
02:03:48,699 --> 02:03:49,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1828
02:03:49,139 --> 02:03:52,800
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole thing is just like, okay, this doesn't take place in New York, so...

1829
02:03:56,366 --> 02:04:01,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Before this game, no one's ever thought, hey, let's make a game where we can kill cops in it.

1830
02:04:01,628 --> 02:04:03,549
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the first game to ever do that.

1831
02:04:03,629 --> 02:04:05,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for pointing this out.

1832
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:13,392
[SPEAKER_13]: This also, I might add, comes from WPEC News 12 Now.

1833
02:04:16,093 --> 02:04:20,554
[SPEAKER_13]: They're a CBS affiliate in, I would assume, the New York area.

1834
02:04:22,623 --> 02:04:26,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Redertainment in chat says, I'm mad because they can kill redheaded dorks.

1835
02:04:28,192 --> 02:04:28,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.

1836
02:04:28,572 --> 02:04:30,736
[SPEAKER_12]: I should be angered about that too, actually.

1837
02:04:31,557 --> 02:04:32,618
[SPEAKER_12]: So is the doctor.

1838
02:04:32,659 --> 02:04:33,460
[SPEAKER_12]: He's waving his hand over there.

1839
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:34,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pissed too.

1840
02:04:36,431 --> 02:04:38,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't even know where the hell this takes place.

1841
02:04:38,672 --> 02:04:44,194
[SPEAKER_13]: It's somewhere on the East Coast that this actual newscast is from.

1842
02:04:44,814 --> 02:04:47,615
[SPEAKER_12]: To which the legend of Zaku promptly follows up and says, Yay!

1843
02:04:47,715 --> 02:04:49,476
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know you could kill gingers in the game.

1844
02:04:49,496 --> 02:04:52,217
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, it's incentive to buy it now.

1845
02:04:54,758 --> 02:04:55,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, gingers.

1846
02:04:57,139 --> 02:05:00,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Ranma... Oh, North Carolina!

1847
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:02,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Not even close, senor!

1848
02:05:02,181 --> 02:05:04,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma in chat says News Channel 12 is a local cable news network.

1849
02:05:08,007 --> 02:05:14,134
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, look, you know, this kind of just dumb assedness always brings on our FUs of the week.

1850
02:05:14,795 --> 02:05:17,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially since Saints Row is a game that Loki loves and adores.

1851
02:05:18,039 --> 02:05:20,202
[SPEAKER_12]: How dare the police department condemn it?

1852
02:05:20,322 --> 02:05:21,404
[SPEAKER_12]: They can condemn it all they want.

1853
02:05:35,984 --> 02:05:46,211
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, FU's The Week, The Election Season, all of it, and, um, uh, Sarah Palin for thinking she's funny.

1854
02:05:48,193 --> 02:05:48,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

1855
02:05:50,394 --> 02:06:01,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, god, I had something early that I was mad at about, but I don't remember, so, FU to News 12, because they have, looks like a

1856
02:06:02,048 --> 02:06:04,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Cast of douchebags that run this thing.

1857
02:06:04,670 --> 02:06:06,371
[SPEAKER_12]: They're all kind of ugly in weird ways.

1858
02:06:07,832 --> 02:06:12,055
[SPEAKER_12]: My FU of the week goes to still not having a solid date for my surgery.

1859
02:06:12,216 --> 02:06:21,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I know when it's going to be, but because some people haven't gotten to my paperwork, I only kind of know that it's probably going to be not this coming week, but the next week.

1860
02:06:21,863 --> 02:06:22,403
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

1861
02:06:23,304 --> 02:06:24,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Fart Princess, do you have any FUs of the week?

1862
02:06:26,146 --> 02:06:26,566
[SPEAKER_12]: The Doctor?

1863
02:06:26,586 --> 02:06:27,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody?

1864
02:06:27,247 --> 02:06:27,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody?

1865
02:06:28,815 --> 02:06:32,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the doctor and I'm mad at poop.

1866
02:06:34,286 --> 02:06:35,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the doctor.

1867
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:37,212
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thank you, doctor.

1868
02:06:37,332 --> 02:06:38,034
[SPEAKER_06]: The parrot has one.

1869
02:06:38,234 --> 02:06:38,535
[SPEAKER_12]: How about...

1870
02:06:39,440 --> 02:06:40,721
[SPEAKER_12]: How about the real doctor?

1871
02:06:40,901 --> 02:06:42,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the real doctor.

1872
02:06:42,142 --> 02:06:42,822
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the real doctor?

1873
02:06:42,882 --> 02:06:46,704
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU's is all the crazy yes on 8 signs in Amador County.

1874
02:06:46,844 --> 02:06:48,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you missed last week.

1875
02:06:48,786 --> 02:06:49,426
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you don't even know.

1876
02:06:49,446 --> 02:06:50,347
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a gauntlet.

1877
02:06:50,367 --> 02:06:52,788
[SPEAKER_10]: You go through town and there's about 70,000 of them.

1878
02:06:52,908 --> 02:06:55,550
[SPEAKER_12]: I already went off on Prop 8 last week.

1879
02:06:55,610 --> 02:06:56,710
[SPEAKER_10]: You missed it.

1880
02:06:56,770 --> 02:06:59,432
[SPEAKER_10]: So fuck you to everyone in Amador County who's going to vote yes on 8.

1881
02:07:00,873 --> 02:07:01,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Protect my rights, bitch.

1882
02:07:01,753 --> 02:07:03,474
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you to everyone in the state that's going to vote yes on 8.

1883
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:05,796
[SPEAKER_04]: If it makes you feel any better, I already voted and I voted no.

1884
02:07:06,236 --> 02:07:06,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1885
02:07:06,937 --> 02:07:07,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Absentee.

1886
02:07:09,313 --> 02:07:10,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Fart Princess, do you have any real FUs?

1887
02:07:12,919 --> 02:07:13,860
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to poop.

1888
02:07:15,903 --> 02:07:16,204
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1889
02:07:17,245 --> 02:07:17,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Ferret.

1890
02:07:17,866 --> 02:07:18,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Ferret would like me to FU.

1891
02:07:19,589 --> 02:07:20,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1892
02:07:20,710 --> 02:07:21,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you, Ferret.

1893
02:07:22,953 --> 02:07:25,496
[SPEAKER_12]: The Ferret is saying to vote no on 8 as well.

1894
02:07:25,756 --> 02:07:26,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1895
02:07:26,477 --> 02:07:28,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.

1896
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:34,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Settlers of Catan, you guys know this game from Xbox Live, or you probably know the original board game, hello.

1897
02:07:35,787 --> 02:07:37,088
[SPEAKER_12]: I never played it.

1898
02:07:37,368 --> 02:07:43,315
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it broke down some walls when it came to Xbox Live Arcade, because it was the first, besides Uno, it was the first really in-depth

1899
02:07:43,615 --> 02:07:44,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Settlers of Catan

1900
02:08:06,171 --> 02:08:10,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, if you don't know what Catan is, it's a game about bartering and trading.

1901
02:08:10,473 --> 02:08:15,196
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like Civilization in board game format, except it made no sense to me when I tried to learn how to play it.

1902
02:08:15,536 --> 02:08:18,117
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have a limited attention span for these type of things.

1903
02:08:18,397 --> 02:08:18,577
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1904
02:08:18,677 --> 02:08:19,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I was more of a Carcassonne fan.

1905
02:08:20,138 --> 02:08:20,338
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1906
02:08:20,558 --> 02:08:20,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

1907
02:08:21,799 --> 02:08:21,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Who?

1908
02:08:22,459 --> 02:08:22,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

1909
02:08:23,120 --> 02:08:23,480
[SPEAKER_12]: You got it.

1910
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:24,440
[SPEAKER_03]: What about carcasses?

1911
02:08:25,581 --> 02:08:25,721
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1912
02:08:26,021 --> 02:08:26,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Just no.

1913
02:08:27,262 --> 02:08:27,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1914
02:08:27,802 --> 02:08:29,983
[SPEAKER_12]: How about games we do understand?

1915
02:08:30,123 --> 02:08:31,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Games where we just shoot and kill things.

1916
02:08:31,929 --> 02:08:33,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, kind of, sort of.

1917
02:08:33,311 --> 02:08:41,520
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have ratings for the ESRB for stuff to come out on Virtual Console, and that would be Metal Slug 2.

1918
02:08:42,962 --> 02:08:46,726
[SPEAKER_04]: You can ride a camel in it, and the camel has a gatling gun.

1919
02:08:47,847 --> 02:08:48,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch out, they spit.

1920
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:51,592
[SPEAKER_04]: This one spits bullets out of his hip.

1921
02:08:52,822 --> 02:08:53,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

1922
02:08:53,602 --> 02:08:54,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Best camel ever.

1923
02:08:55,543 --> 02:08:58,964
[SPEAKER_04]: The other game is A Boy and His Blob.

1924
02:08:58,984 --> 02:09:01,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Trouble on Blobolonia.

1925
02:09:01,345 --> 02:09:03,926
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to the DS version that was supposed to come out?

1926
02:09:04,486 --> 02:09:05,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Did it ever come out?

1927
02:09:05,747 --> 02:09:09,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it ever did, actually.

1928
02:09:09,948 --> 02:09:11,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe the publisher went under, I don't know.

1929
02:09:11,228 --> 02:09:12,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Get those jelly beans ready.

1930
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:15,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Jelly beans.

1931
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:17,130
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1932
02:09:17,310 --> 02:09:18,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody gets that.

1933
02:09:19,381 --> 02:09:19,942
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1934
02:09:39,366 --> 02:09:40,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's sadness.

1935
02:09:40,867 --> 02:09:41,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Never happened.

1936
02:09:41,688 --> 02:09:45,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really pique my interest anyway when we went to E3 and we saw it.

1937
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:46,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Rob.

1938
02:09:46,130 --> 02:09:46,310
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

1939
02:09:46,771 --> 02:09:47,811
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes my heart hurt.

1940
02:09:47,892 --> 02:09:48,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, it makes my heart hurt too.

1941
02:09:48,952 --> 02:09:50,093
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a new one coming out.

1942
02:09:50,493 --> 02:09:51,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we?

1943
02:09:51,114 --> 02:09:51,914
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's exciting.

1944
02:09:51,994 --> 02:09:53,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the virtual console one.

1945
02:09:53,055 --> 02:09:53,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, virtual console.

1946
02:09:53,775 --> 02:09:54,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's okay.

1947
02:09:55,136 --> 02:09:55,717
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the same.

1948
02:09:55,817 --> 02:09:57,438
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same damn game I've already played.

1949
02:09:58,038 --> 02:09:59,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I could just play the Nintendo.

1950
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:04,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we get back into some news, I want to take a little detour because you guys got to the show late.

1951
02:10:04,022 --> 02:10:08,685
[SPEAKER_12]: You didn't get to talk about your gaming week, but you were telling me, Fart Princess, that there was a game you wanted to talk about.

1952
02:10:09,659 --> 02:10:10,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there is.

1953
02:10:12,704 --> 02:10:14,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing Hello Kitty online.

1954
02:10:16,169 --> 02:10:16,770
[SPEAKER_12]: For real?

1955
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:17,491
[SPEAKER_12]: This isn't a joke?

1956
02:10:17,831 --> 02:10:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: No, why would it be a joke?

1957
02:10:20,535 --> 02:10:22,118
[SPEAKER_12]: There really is a Hello Kitty online?

1958
02:10:22,709 --> 02:10:24,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I'd appreciate it if you stopped farting.

1959
02:10:24,891 --> 02:10:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really rude.

1960
02:10:25,592 --> 02:10:28,975
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you play as a boy or a girl character.

1961
02:10:45,469 --> 02:10:46,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1962
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:47,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you do.

1963
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:48,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1964
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:50,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure you have a butt too.

1965
02:10:51,172 --> 02:10:57,074
[SPEAKER_05]: You can like... You're interrupting me, Rob.

1966
02:10:57,274 --> 02:10:57,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1967
02:10:57,894 --> 02:10:58,414
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1968
02:10:59,035 --> 02:10:59,615
[SPEAKER_05]: What's so funny?

1969
02:11:00,075 --> 02:11:00,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing.

1970
02:11:00,515 --> 02:11:02,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

1971
02:11:04,597 --> 02:11:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob!

1972
02:11:05,557 --> 02:11:06,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, Rob.

1973
02:11:06,138 --> 02:11:06,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Close your ass.

1974
02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:07,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Knock it off.

1975
02:11:07,538 --> 02:11:08,299
[SPEAKER_12]: Gaming news.

1976
02:11:08,779 --> 02:11:11,740
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to let you talk about Hello Kitty if you don't get to it.

1977
02:11:12,145 --> 02:11:12,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, farty.

1978
02:11:17,289 --> 02:11:28,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You level in the traditional sense of an MMO, but there's no... You can't kill anything in the game unless you fart on it.

1979
02:11:31,179 --> 02:11:35,343
[SPEAKER_05]: The way you level in the game is... Yes, that's totally it.

1980
02:11:35,443 --> 02:11:40,967
[SPEAKER_05]: You forage for stuff, like you gather plants and stuff, and then when you eat it, you go...

1981
02:11:41,147 --> 02:11:42,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

1982
02:11:51,107 --> 02:11:52,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

1983
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:19,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it, Rob.

1984
02:12:19,481 --> 02:12:22,827
[SPEAKER_05]: New from Squeenix, Fatal Fletchlets.

1985
02:12:23,288 --> 02:12:25,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's basically the gist of the game.

1986
02:12:33,893 --> 02:12:35,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Look what you did, Rob.

1987
02:12:36,155 --> 02:12:37,896
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be ashamed of yourself.

1988
02:12:38,196 --> 02:12:42,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm thinking there actually should be a game called Hello Farty.

1989
02:12:42,540 --> 02:12:44,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, stop it.

1990
02:12:44,261 --> 02:12:46,403
[SPEAKER_12]: People in the chatroom are complaining about their speakers.

1991
02:12:49,505 --> 02:12:51,406
[SPEAKER_05]: They should be complaining about the smell.

1992
02:12:53,127 --> 02:12:54,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Can we get on to some gaming?

1993
02:12:55,487 --> 02:12:57,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought I would actually learn something about Hello Kitty.

1994
02:12:57,868 --> 02:12:58,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I told you about it.

1995
02:12:58,989 --> 02:13:00,049
[SPEAKER_05]: All about it.

1996
02:13:00,069 --> 02:13:00,990
[SPEAKER_12]: You just farted a lot.

1997
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:02,710
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't even listen.

1998
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:04,951
[SPEAKER_12]: SSJ100Matt says Rob's going to write a hate letter to the show.

1999
02:13:04,991 --> 02:13:05,491
[SPEAKER_12]: That is true.

2000
02:13:06,592 --> 02:13:06,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

2001
02:13:07,492 --> 02:13:11,415
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to make sure that before the podcast goes out, we strip out all the fart noises.

2002
02:13:11,515 --> 02:13:12,896
[SPEAKER_05]: But then it wouldn't make sense.

2003
02:13:12,916 --> 02:13:13,796
[SPEAKER_05]: There would just be a bunch of giggling.

2004
02:13:13,816 --> 02:13:19,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to patch it for day one release, so that anybody who does obtain the podcast early does not get to hear the fart noises.

2005
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:21,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Every fart noise is going to be replaced with birds chirping.

2006
02:13:22,082 --> 02:13:23,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that'd be great.

2007
02:13:23,123 --> 02:13:25,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'd be giggling at birds chirping.

2008
02:13:25,604 --> 02:13:26,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd need to be farting.

2009
02:13:26,565 --> 02:13:27,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy little birds.

2010
02:13:27,405 --> 02:13:28,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd be Hello Birdie.

2011
02:13:29,507 --> 02:13:31,108
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Rock Band?

2012
02:13:31,570 --> 02:13:32,491
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2013
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:50,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero 3

2014
02:14:18,146 --> 02:14:21,229
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but they had a demo at the store.

2015
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:22,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, so you haven't really played rock band.

2016
02:14:23,832 --> 02:14:25,193
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been in a Best Buy band.

2017
02:14:27,496 --> 02:14:32,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Wii Music, the other type of band game.

2018
02:14:32,421 --> 02:14:34,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Wii Music is doing very well in Japan.

2019
02:14:34,884 --> 02:14:37,727
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's been getting a little bit of negative press around the fan.

2020
02:14:38,367 --> 02:14:40,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, here's what I'm curious about.

2021
02:14:41,290 --> 02:14:44,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Doctor, you're a big, giant Nintendo whore.

2022
02:14:44,673 --> 02:14:46,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you love everything Nintendo.

2023
02:14:46,494 --> 02:14:48,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we're kind of not feeling Wii music.

2024
02:14:48,656 --> 02:14:49,376
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

2025
02:14:51,198 --> 02:14:56,042
[SPEAKER_04]: By Wii, he means himself and Loki.

2026
02:14:56,062 --> 02:14:58,604
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to point out, though, DarkSakura has said she wouldn't pay for it.

2027
02:14:59,144 --> 02:14:59,344
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

2028
02:14:59,905 --> 02:15:01,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have paid for it if I didn't know I was getting one for free.

2029
02:15:02,106 --> 02:15:02,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2030
02:15:02,647 --> 02:15:02,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow.

2031
02:15:02,987 --> 02:15:03,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

2032
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:07,312
[SPEAKER_12]: The Doctor, are you interested in Wii music at all?

2033
02:15:07,752 --> 02:15:08,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

2034
02:15:09,094 --> 02:15:10,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, and I am the biggest.

2035
02:15:10,635 --> 02:15:11,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Nintendo.

2036
02:15:12,277 --> 02:15:16,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just like, I'm kind of bored with these completely novelty games.

2037
02:15:16,781 --> 02:15:22,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, there's so many cool things that they could do on the Wii, and they're just not.

2038
02:15:23,427 --> 02:15:27,391
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just like, okay, here's another game where you get to wave the Wii mode around.

2039
02:15:27,491 --> 02:15:28,352
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just like, eh.

2040
02:15:30,762 --> 02:15:31,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well guess what?

2041
02:15:31,522 --> 02:15:34,344
[SPEAKER_12]: The country of Japan disagrees with us and agrees with DarkSakura.

2042
02:15:34,864 --> 02:15:43,148
[SPEAKER_12]: According to Famitsu, I'm sorry, according to Famitsu's publisher, InnerBrain, 50,000 units were sold on day one in Japan.

2043
02:15:43,668 --> 02:15:46,529
[SPEAKER_12]: So the game is doing huge in Japan and sold a lot.

2044
02:15:47,249 --> 02:15:47,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

2045
02:15:48,590 --> 02:15:52,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it or not, it looks like this game will probably have similar success over here.

2046
02:15:52,514 --> 02:16:01,182
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, to recap what we've kind of said before on this program, at least myself, if it gets young kids interested in music, it's not a bad thing.

2047
02:16:01,222 --> 02:16:04,606
[SPEAKER_12]: But for this old kid, no thank you, I'll pass.

2048
02:16:05,487 --> 02:16:06,207
[SPEAKER_12]: More gaming news.

2049
02:16:07,386 --> 02:16:08,307
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I gotta?

2050
02:16:08,827 --> 02:16:15,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Just one more, then we're gonna open up the Skype line pretty soon at 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Noms Radio.

2051
02:16:16,093 --> 02:16:16,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice plug.

2052
02:16:17,234 --> 02:16:17,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2053
02:16:17,834 --> 02:16:23,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this goes back to a series that was one of the first ones I ever played when the PlayStation first came out.

2054
02:16:24,340 --> 02:16:30,144
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, it was one of the first games that anyone played on the PlayStation when it first came out.

2055
02:16:31,005 --> 02:16:32,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Toshinden.

2056
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:34,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Toshinden, actually.

2057
02:16:35,112 --> 02:16:40,518
[SPEAKER_04]: The third one was great because it was awful and had the butt monkey in it and the guy with the chainsaw named David.

2058
02:16:40,818 --> 02:16:42,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone loves the butt monkey.

2059
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,421
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the butt monkey dance!

2060
02:16:43,982 --> 02:16:44,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2061
02:16:44,843 --> 02:16:46,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Did he spank his butt?

2062
02:16:46,084 --> 02:16:48,467
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he was like a baboon and he had like a big red butt.

2063
02:16:48,868 --> 02:16:51,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And whenever he went, he would do this little clappy dance.

2064
02:16:51,951 --> 02:16:52,552
[SPEAKER_10]: With his butt?

2065
02:16:53,112 --> 02:16:53,593
[SPEAKER_04]: With his butt.

2066
02:16:54,694 --> 02:17:04,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, there's actually news in Famitsu that says Takara Tomy is going to be bringing out the Toshinden series on the Wii.

2067
02:17:04,756 --> 02:17:07,697
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they'll actually make it better?

2068
02:17:09,197 --> 02:17:09,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

2069
02:17:10,257 --> 02:17:11,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you get to spank the monkey's butt?

2070
02:17:12,498 --> 02:17:13,618
[SPEAKER_04]: But it looks kind of cool.

2071
02:17:14,738 --> 02:17:15,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Toshinden.

2072
02:17:17,259 --> 02:17:22,220
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I guess retro games making a comeback is nothing new in this current-gen world.

2073
02:17:23,106 --> 02:17:25,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to go, that just means I need to go find that issue of Fummy 2.

2074
02:17:26,408 --> 02:17:28,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Wario Land is pretty good for that.

2075
02:17:29,169 --> 02:17:31,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Wario, have you bought the new Wario Land?

2076
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:31,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, yeah.

2077
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:32,751
[SPEAKER_10]: That game is actually really fun.

2078
02:17:32,771 --> 02:17:36,953
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very good, and it has really, I mean, it's this great 2D animation, like, it's good.

2079
02:17:38,273 --> 02:17:42,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, sorry, let's talk about PC games a little bit quickly before we get to some calls.

2080
02:17:42,736 --> 02:17:42,976
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

2081
02:17:42,996 --> 02:17:43,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Boycott!

2082
02:17:44,468 --> 02:17:46,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's no boycott yet.

2083
02:17:47,393 --> 02:17:52,781
[SPEAKER_13]: But Far Cry 2 is going to be bundled with everybody's favorite sport, digital rights management.

2084
02:17:52,962 --> 02:17:53,442
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

2085
02:17:53,903 --> 02:17:57,950
[SPEAKER_13]: You can get Securom technology along with...

2086
02:18:00,654 --> 02:18:04,136
[SPEAKER_13]: It will have these restrictions.

2087
02:18:04,557 --> 02:18:09,059
[SPEAKER_13]: The purchasers will have up to five activations on three separate PCs.

2088
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Uninstalling Far Cry 2 refunds an activation, and this process is known as a revoke.

2089
02:18:16,184 --> 02:18:21,988
[SPEAKER_13]: As long as you properly uninstall the game, you'll be able to reinstall it an unlimited number of times on three machines.

2090
02:18:22,868 --> 02:18:28,112
[SPEAKER_13]: A computer can be upgraded an unlimited number of times using revoke.

2091
02:18:29,413 --> 02:18:32,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Ubisoft is willing to provide additional activations if necessary.

2092
02:18:33,537 --> 02:18:39,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Ubisoft is committed to a long-term support of their games and you'll always be able to play Far Cry 2.

2093
02:18:41,684 --> 02:18:44,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So apparently this is what they're going to start doing from now on.

2094
02:18:44,387 --> 02:18:48,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand why they're still using secure ROM technology since it can be so easily broken.

2095
02:18:48,451 --> 02:18:49,812
[SPEAKER_12]: And people just hate it in general.

2096
02:18:49,872 --> 02:18:52,755
[SPEAKER_12]: But do people as a whole, do they really seem to care?

2097
02:18:53,123 --> 02:19:16,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, not according to EA, who says that the small percentage, they're claiming that 99.8% of consumers will never notice the digital rights management that's in the game, which I think is kind of sad that they don't notice that it's in there because it could potentially harm their system, especially when it comes to CD burning software and stuff like that, whatever, that it interrupts.

2098
02:19:18,396 --> 02:19:24,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And the fact that these people are unaware that this game is actually causing this problem, that they will go take it in at the cost of money.

2099
02:19:25,018 --> 02:19:31,179
[SPEAKER_13]: But either way, it says we can eliminate piracy by essentially blocking the online service from the pirate.

2100
02:19:32,019 --> 02:19:34,900
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the future of digital rights management.

2101
02:19:35,320 --> 02:19:41,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's nice, you know, but some people don't really care about the online portion of your game, and they will still pirate it.

2102
02:19:41,982 --> 02:19:45,603
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I think there was quite a few copies of Spore that were pirated.

2103
02:19:46,403 --> 02:20:00,131
[SPEAKER_13]: and to be honest all they're losing is the online portion of it and if you really don't give a crap about seeing other people's penis monsters then you can still play the game Legend of Zaku in chat says gotta love EA pulling voodoo stats out of their asses is that what this is?

2104
02:20:00,751 --> 02:20:12,718
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so I mean I don't know we don't know for sure how many people actually know about it so we have to take their word for it it's not necessarily they're pulling it out of their ass it's just the way they report the numbers that's just politics

2105
02:20:14,676 --> 02:20:14,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

2106
02:20:15,016 --> 02:20:21,540
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like they think that people that are complaining about it are going to go, Oh, well, okay, so not that many people are complaining about it.

2107
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:22,841
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I'll just stop complaining.

2108
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:23,481
[SPEAKER_13]: You're right.

2109
02:20:24,101 --> 02:20:25,022
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's not going to happen.

2110
02:20:26,786 --> 02:20:27,006
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

2111
02:20:27,466 --> 02:20:30,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyhow, one more story, then we're going to get to some calls on the Skype line.

2112
02:20:30,707 --> 02:20:32,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And this one has to do with Ghostbusters.

2113
02:20:32,568 --> 02:20:35,989
[SPEAKER_12]: You know that game that we hear things about it, then it goes away, then it comes back?

2114
02:20:36,030 --> 02:20:42,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, people are talking about Ghostbusters again, and it's all thanks to Dan Aykroyd, which, of course, is one of the actors in the original movie.

2115
02:20:42,612 --> 02:20:45,153
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was on a Dallas radio station this week, 105.3.

2116
02:20:46,313 --> 02:20:50,375
[SPEAKER_12]: And he actually talked to the radio station and actually confirmed...

2117
02:20:50,715 --> 02:20:51,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

2118
02:21:18,587 --> 02:21:21,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Sats crazier than a vaporous full torso apparition.

2119
02:21:24,732 --> 02:21:25,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

2120
02:21:25,233 --> 02:21:27,595
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me giddy, but we're talking about piss in the chat room.

2121
02:21:28,495 --> 02:21:30,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, okay.

2122
02:21:30,897 --> 02:21:31,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

2123
02:21:31,658 --> 02:21:35,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com for an experience that really can't be described.

2124
02:21:36,382 --> 02:21:36,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my.

2125
02:21:37,843 --> 02:21:41,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It's talking about scientific fact that urine is a sterile solution.

2126
02:21:42,762 --> 02:21:44,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you ever talk games in the chatroom out of curiosity?

2127
02:21:45,204 --> 02:21:45,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, just curious.

2128
02:21:46,045 --> 02:21:47,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you pee on your video games?

2129
02:21:47,226 --> 02:21:49,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, someone brought up peeing in the shower.

2130
02:21:49,648 --> 02:21:50,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

2131
02:21:50,649 --> 02:21:53,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I was making fun and doing the girly thing.

2132
02:21:54,232 --> 02:21:55,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to stand in their own piss?

2133
02:21:55,793 --> 02:21:57,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah.

2134
02:21:57,054 --> 02:21:59,256
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR now is a great time.

2135
02:21:59,356 --> 02:22:00,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Just want to point that out.

2136
02:22:00,337 --> 02:22:01,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Now is an excellent time.

2137
02:22:02,039 --> 02:22:03,500
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Sigourney Weaver's in the game.

2138
02:22:05,334 --> 02:22:06,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, acidic vampire is a very good point.

2139
02:22:06,835 --> 02:22:07,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Will Soren Weaver be in the game?

2140
02:22:08,016 --> 02:22:11,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Dark Tetsuya brings up OLR, it's like pissing in an ocean of piss.

2141
02:22:12,039 --> 02:22:16,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Will the game be nearly as cool as the Commodore 64 version of Ghostbusters?

2142
02:22:16,562 --> 02:22:17,102
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it has piss.

2143
02:22:17,122 --> 02:22:17,863
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

2144
02:22:20,004 --> 02:22:20,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, you are red.

2145
02:22:20,945 --> 02:22:22,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Porn is better than the original version.

2146
02:22:22,886 --> 02:22:29,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that the first half of the show was really smart and intelligent, and the second half has been nothing but piss and fart.

2147
02:22:29,111 --> 02:22:29,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Pfft.

2148
02:22:30,796 --> 02:22:33,237
[SPEAKER_12]: God, this show is just so strange.

2149
02:22:33,677 --> 02:22:38,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe our caller... Look, let's go to the phones.

2150
02:22:38,358 --> 02:22:38,999
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a caller.

2151
02:22:39,039 --> 02:22:42,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see what IQ level they're at tonight.

2152
02:22:42,460 --> 02:22:43,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

2153
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:43,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2154
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:47,761
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Ranma, who is just as immature as everybody else in the studio.

2155
02:22:48,041 --> 02:22:49,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hooray.

2156
02:22:49,722 --> 02:22:50,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Ranma, what's on your mind?

2157
02:22:51,702 --> 02:22:54,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Not much, but, Ranma, I have a bone to pick with you.

2158
02:22:55,043 --> 02:22:56,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God, what did I do now?

2159
02:22:57,364 --> 02:23:00,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm offended by how you pronounce people's names.

2160
02:23:01,966 --> 02:23:10,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you know, I find it pretty offensive, too, that I can't learn to fucking read, especially with all the languages in the world that people derive their names from.

2161
02:23:10,508 --> 02:23:20,851
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very offended that I just don't, like, fucking know because, you know, sometimes you read things one way in one language and they read another way in another, and I'm offended by my lack of edumacation.

2162
02:23:23,532 --> 02:23:24,813
[SPEAKER_09]: You know we love you, Rob, right?

2163
02:23:24,973 --> 02:23:25,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know.

2164
02:23:26,113 --> 02:23:27,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you just trying to be a smartass about something?

2165
02:23:28,674 --> 02:23:28,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2166
02:23:29,594 --> 02:23:29,974
[SPEAKER_12]: And what?

2167
02:23:31,732 --> 02:23:33,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about the whole little big planet.

2168
02:23:33,933 --> 02:23:34,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.

2169
02:23:34,673 --> 02:23:35,953
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all it is.

2170
02:23:36,033 --> 02:23:37,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you say ridiculous?

2171
02:23:39,754 --> 02:23:46,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody gets offended over something, and the problem is not enough people in this world is open-minded to realize it's nothing to be that serious.

2172
02:23:47,376 --> 02:23:48,216
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all it is.

2173
02:23:49,036 --> 02:23:54,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, in a way, how Muslims are kind of being subjugated about what's going on in the news and the media.

2174
02:23:54,958 --> 02:23:58,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, something like this they're going to pick up on, and they're going to lose their minds about it.

2175
02:23:59,767 --> 02:24:01,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that really Sony's fault, though?

2176
02:24:01,607 --> 02:24:10,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, kind of like I was saying before, is that if Sony doesn't do anything about this, and then the mainstream media picks up on this, I mean, it's going to do a lot of damage.

2177
02:24:11,009 --> 02:24:14,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas Sony's trying to put out a fire here before it gets too big.

2178
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:17,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but why should they?

2179
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:19,971
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's a normal song.

2180
02:24:20,011 --> 02:24:20,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Big deal.

2181
02:24:20,631 --> 02:24:22,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Sadly, it's the world we live in.

2182
02:24:22,171 --> 02:24:23,371
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying it's alright.

2183
02:24:23,411 --> 02:24:25,352
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, it's what it is.

2184
02:24:26,152 --> 02:24:26,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2185
02:24:28,583 --> 02:24:29,324
[SPEAKER_12]: What else is on your mind?

2186
02:24:29,344 --> 02:24:31,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you been to any cons lately you want to talk about?

2187
02:24:31,768 --> 02:24:35,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I just got back from a convention about six, seven hours ago.

2188
02:24:36,054 --> 02:24:37,295
[SPEAKER_12]: You are the con king.

2189
02:24:37,396 --> 02:24:38,858
[SPEAKER_12]: What con did you go to this time?

2190
02:24:39,696 --> 02:24:40,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a con whore.

2191
02:24:41,036 --> 02:24:42,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to Zenkai Con.

2192
02:24:42,957 --> 02:24:44,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Where is Zenkai Con?

2193
02:24:44,858 --> 02:24:47,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Valley Forge Convention Center, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.

2194
02:24:47,519 --> 02:24:49,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where Classic Game Expo was a few years ago.

2195
02:24:50,099 --> 02:24:50,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, okay.

2196
02:24:50,720 --> 02:24:51,600
[SPEAKER_12]: So how was it?

2197
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:53,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Was there a lot of gaming stuff to be seen there?

2198
02:24:53,721 --> 02:24:54,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it mostly anime or what?

2199
02:24:55,501 --> 02:25:00,023
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a mix of A and B, but wasn't that many video gaming cosplay.

2200
02:25:00,043 --> 02:25:02,523
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will say the game room was nice.

2201
02:25:02,643 --> 02:25:05,104
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

2202
02:25:05,404 --> 02:25:07,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you get to play anything in the game room you hadn't played before?

2203
02:25:08,457 --> 02:25:11,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I've pretty much played the new Bleach game for the Wii.

2204
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:12,482
[SPEAKER_09]: That one I have not played yet.

2205
02:25:14,905 --> 02:25:15,325
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think?

2206
02:25:16,306 --> 02:25:17,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was pretty good.

2207
02:25:17,067 --> 02:25:25,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the fact that to attack, you actually shake the Wii mode to attack in the game, which is something I've never seen in a Wii game before, really.

2208
02:25:26,137 --> 02:25:27,599
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, never heard of that one.

2209
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:30,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one?

2210
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:31,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, that was a good one.

2211
02:25:58,137 --> 02:26:00,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you got the important one, it was good.

2212
02:26:00,099 --> 02:26:00,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

2213
02:26:24,011 --> 02:26:24,671
[SPEAKER_12]: What system was this?

2214
02:26:24,771 --> 02:26:25,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I never played the Ranma.

2215
02:26:26,932 --> 02:26:29,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I played a Ranma game on Super Nintendo.

2216
02:26:29,052 --> 02:26:32,633
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also one on PC Engine.

2217
02:26:32,673 --> 02:26:36,514
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an RPG on PC Engine, which I've played a little bit of.

2218
02:26:36,574 --> 02:26:37,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of hard.

2219
02:26:38,015 --> 02:26:42,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on PlayStation, there was Ranma 1 Half Battle Renaissance, which I've got, and it's kind of fun.

2220
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:47,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Rice Princess is like Ranma, because if you pour water on her, she goes... Shut up.

2221
02:26:47,777 --> 02:26:49,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you play Battle Renaissance?

2222
02:26:51,045 --> 02:26:51,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I played it.

2223
02:26:52,706 --> 02:26:55,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought the engine was a little bit loose, but it was still fun.

2224
02:26:55,268 --> 02:26:56,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when you get to fight in the curse forms.

2225
02:26:57,130 --> 02:26:59,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I love actually kicking people's butt as peach on.

2226
02:26:59,952 --> 02:27:00,512
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2227
02:27:00,972 --> 02:27:01,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2228
02:27:03,034 --> 02:27:04,935
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, any other comments before we get to some more calls?

2229
02:27:06,296 --> 02:27:10,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, one thing you'll probably get a real kick out of, I have pictures up there uploaded soon and sent to you guys.

2230
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:14,342
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a Samba de Amigo dance party at the convention Friday night.

2231
02:27:14,703 --> 02:27:15,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, dear good lord.

2232
02:27:15,683 --> 02:27:18,926
[SPEAKER_12]: How exactly does one go to a Samba de Amigo dance party?

2233
02:27:20,526 --> 02:27:22,127
[SPEAKER_09]: You should put that on YouTube.

2234
02:27:47,209 --> 02:27:48,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It probably is.

2235
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:53,952
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not up now, it should be up by later this week, and I will find images and links to it, and I'll send it to you guys.

2236
02:27:54,372 --> 02:27:57,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, Ranma, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy.

2237
02:27:57,873 --> 02:27:58,694
[SPEAKER_12]: You too, enjoy.

2238
02:27:58,894 --> 02:27:59,774
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh-huh.

2239
02:27:59,794 --> 02:28:03,976
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

2240
02:28:04,936 --> 02:28:06,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2241
02:28:06,037 --> 02:28:06,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2242
02:28:07,397 --> 02:28:08,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.

2243
02:28:09,018 --> 02:28:14,820
[SPEAKER_11]: It is he who seeks to replace the train wreck of the General Messes with the train wreck of his own choosing.

2244
02:28:15,160 --> 02:28:17,201
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, and you are?

2245
02:28:19,461 --> 02:28:20,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Introduce yourself.

2246
02:28:20,361 --> 02:28:21,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob, Adrian at Hydra.

2247
02:28:23,942 --> 02:28:26,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I know who you are, but you have to introduce yourself to the listeners.

2248
02:28:26,983 --> 02:28:27,383
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Jason.

2249
02:28:27,643 --> 02:28:28,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Jason.

2250
02:28:28,224 --> 02:28:28,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, what's on your mind?

2251
02:28:29,844 --> 02:28:36,266
[SPEAKER_11]: So, since we ever so briefly touched on it, I thought I'd add in a couple little comments since we didn't really go onto it.

2252
02:28:37,426 --> 02:28:38,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Two side notes before I do that.

2253
02:28:39,086 --> 02:28:41,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Jump Superstars, while it wasn't really in

2254
02:28:41,502 --> 02:28:42,864
[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2255
02:28:59,622 --> 02:29:08,690
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I have the first game, and I don't have the second game, I have the first game, and although Quest Mode was awful, awful, awful, I like the song List and Steps of what there was.

2256
02:29:10,192 --> 02:29:17,799
[SPEAKER_11]: When I bought my Xbox, I have quite a few other games as well, but my initial reasoning for wanting to buy it was pretty much purely the Ultimate series.

2257
02:29:18,459 --> 02:29:18,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

2258
02:29:18,779 --> 02:29:19,320
[SPEAKER_11]: They were great.

2259
02:29:19,978 --> 02:29:29,604
[SPEAKER_11]: and then E3 came around with the universe redone banners from boring hell and I've just never cared to play the universe series at all.

2260
02:29:30,236 --> 02:29:34,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but past the banners, it's kind of nice to have the game in high def and widescreen.

2261
02:29:34,557 --> 02:29:36,357
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a neat little change for the game.

2262
02:29:36,557 --> 02:29:37,878
[SPEAKER_11]: It probably is.

2263
02:29:38,018 --> 02:29:38,778
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't doubt that.

2264
02:29:38,978 --> 02:29:43,099
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, Ultramix was never the most visually appealing game in the first place.

2265
02:29:43,139 --> 02:29:44,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody's going to deny that.

2266
02:29:45,319 --> 02:29:54,061
[SPEAKER_12]: It played really well past the first one, but it never looked... Universe 2 was kind of just like Universe 1 from what I understood, but Universe 3 is supposed to be a lot different.

2267
02:29:54,501 --> 02:29:55,721
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm curious.

2268
02:29:56,101 --> 02:29:57,161
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll check it out, probably.

2269
02:29:58,402 --> 02:29:59,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny, all this from the Bomani

2270
02:30:00,686 --> 02:30:01,446
[SPEAKER_11]: The main note.

2271
02:30:01,506 --> 02:30:02,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny story.

2272
02:30:02,227 --> 02:30:05,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you guys heard of the there's a sim file that DM Ashura made quite a while ago called Delta Max.

2273
02:30:05,829 --> 02:30:06,329
[SPEAKER_12]: Ever heard of it?

2274
02:30:30,927 --> 02:30:31,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

2275
02:30:31,287 --> 02:30:31,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Vaguely.

2276
02:30:32,428 --> 02:30:34,369
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who DM Assure is, but I vaguely know.

2277
02:30:34,389 --> 02:30:35,930
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the gimmick, so to say, about it.

2278
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:37,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember the gimmick.

2279
02:30:37,890 --> 02:30:39,591
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't it that you hit all four notes at once or something?

2280
02:30:40,131 --> 02:30:42,212
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and that's an old gimmick, but that's okay.

2281
02:30:43,793 --> 02:30:45,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't... There's a lot of gimmicks.

2282
02:30:45,234 --> 02:30:48,675
[SPEAKER_11]: The gimmick is that it's a DM Assure remix of the Max series.

2283
02:30:49,696 --> 02:30:53,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It starts at, I think, 130 beats per minute, and it ends at 573.

2284
02:30:54,963 --> 02:30:55,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the one?

2285
02:30:55,363 --> 02:30:55,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

2286
02:30:56,704 --> 02:30:58,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is it the one that rolls backwards?

2287
02:30:58,146 --> 02:30:59,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I remember that being a gimmick too.

2288
02:30:59,507 --> 02:30:59,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2289
02:31:00,608 --> 02:31:00,868
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

2290
02:31:00,928 --> 02:31:02,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so it starts... It's all progression.

2291
02:31:02,849 --> 02:31:03,510
[SPEAKER_11]: 130 to 573.

2292
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:10,255
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like a BPM per measure, but it speeds up.

2293
02:31:11,596 --> 02:31:13,458
[SPEAKER_11]: The speed is not statically increasing.

2294
02:31:13,498 --> 02:31:14,399
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very variable.

2295
02:31:14,539 --> 02:31:15,319
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes with the tune.

2296
02:31:15,379 --> 02:31:16,460
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually really cool.

2297
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:17,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2298
02:31:17,588 --> 02:31:25,614
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a Stepmania cabinet that a friend of ours built into the DDR machine down in Colorado Springs that there's a tournament going on at next month.

2299
02:31:25,714 --> 02:31:31,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that anybody, hey, if you're in the Colorado area, come down to Mr. Bakes next weekend, rather, not next month.

2300
02:31:31,639 --> 02:31:32,740
[SPEAKER_11]: There's going to be a lot of cool people there.

2301
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:33,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Ding!

2302
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:34,141
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my plug for the day.

2303
02:31:35,782 --> 02:31:44,109
[SPEAKER_11]: So he has a Stepmania cab with all of the official DDR songs, a ton of sim files, Delta Max being one of them, and a couple of other little bonus extras like in the groove.

2304
02:31:46,249 --> 02:31:55,776
[SPEAKER_11]: I was very, very disappointed to hear that DeltaMax in Universe 3 isn't going to have the sim-created background video.

2305
02:31:56,417 --> 02:32:02,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if it did, I could have claimed my own little piece of assistance property in a DDR official game.

2306
02:32:04,423 --> 02:32:04,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

2307
02:32:04,623 --> 02:32:08,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you do something with this?

2308
02:32:08,086 --> 02:32:09,687
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a person nicknamed Tora.

2309
02:32:10,188 --> 02:32:39,362
[SPEAKER_11]: that I believe he actually did all of the background work basically I don't even remember what the image background is but he created a series of text of all of the beats per minute all the BPM numbers and they have this shaky fluid effect and he put the videos for that together amazingly but what I did was I wrote out a quick little script to actually put in the changes that he wanted to and again it goes up it was a pain in the ass too

2310
02:32:40,249 --> 02:32:47,234
[SPEAKER_11]: Just the changes in the videos, the fact that it's not just linear straight up, calculating which measurement and time that it happens on.

2311
02:32:47,755 --> 02:32:48,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I barely even remember.

2312
02:32:48,475 --> 02:32:49,476
[SPEAKER_11]: That was like three years ago.

2313
02:32:49,976 --> 02:32:52,038
[SPEAKER_11]: But it was a very awesome video.

2314
02:32:52,058 --> 02:32:53,138
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very simple.

2315
02:32:53,259 --> 02:32:54,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But Konami came in and changed it all.

2316
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:57,281
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know what it's going to be, but they changed it.

2317
02:32:57,542 --> 02:32:58,943
[SPEAKER_12]: They want to do their own thing, probably.

2318
02:32:59,383 --> 02:33:00,924
[SPEAKER_12]: There'll be flowers and sparkles.

2319
02:33:03,005 --> 02:33:03,686
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's universe.

2320
02:33:03,726 --> 02:33:06,888
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be spaceships and Uranus.

2321
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:07,749
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be...

2322
02:33:10,166 --> 02:33:15,987
[SPEAKER_11]: On that note, it'll be a lot of delta triangles flying over the screen because, you know, delta and triangles.

2323
02:33:16,527 --> 02:33:18,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, oh my god, trigonometry, no!

2324
02:33:18,868 --> 02:33:25,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, sorry to hear you just missed your chance for remote video game stardom, but hey, you have OLR stardom.

2325
02:33:26,069 --> 02:33:27,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other things you want to say real quick before we move on?

2326
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:31,910
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think that was my excuse for calling in tonight.

2327
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:33,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, Jason, take care.

2328
02:33:33,670 --> 02:33:34,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for your comments.

2329
02:33:34,311 --> 02:33:35,171
[SPEAKER_12]: See ya.

2330
02:33:38,193 --> 02:33:38,933
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll take one more call.

2331
02:33:38,953 --> 02:33:40,894
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype.

2332
02:33:41,014 --> 02:33:42,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2333
02:33:43,015 --> 02:33:45,436
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have some last minute stories to do before we get on out of here.

2334
02:33:45,476 --> 02:33:48,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, live listeners, you'll want to stay tuned tonight past the show.

2335
02:33:48,837 --> 02:33:50,118
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a little treat for you guys.

2336
02:33:50,218 --> 02:33:51,318
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get into that in a little while.

2337
02:33:51,698 --> 02:33:54,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Those of you guys listening on the podcast, though, be sure to join us next week for episode 300.

2338
02:33:54,999 --> 02:33:57,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2339
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:57,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

2340
02:33:59,561 --> 02:34:00,081
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just me.

2341
02:34:00,101 --> 02:34:01,522
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope my call is not screwed up.

2342
02:34:01,882 --> 02:34:03,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hello, GS68.

2343
02:34:03,503 --> 02:34:04,063
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

2344
02:34:05,483 --> 02:34:05,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

2345
02:34:11,529 --> 02:34:22,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that the Mario 3 fan translation is out, I hope that Nintendo takes notice and starts working on an official one.

2346
02:34:22,292 --> 02:34:24,293
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good question, eh?

2347
02:34:38,996 --> 02:34:41,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I myself would buy the official thing if it were to come out.

2348
02:34:41,977 --> 02:34:48,380
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the translators encourage buying the official merchandise and stuff.

2349
02:34:49,501 --> 02:35:04,367
[SPEAKER_08]: But as far as the Nintendo side of things, I just hope that if they decide to do something like sue the translators or something like that, that it means that they're working on an official translation and they're not just going to leave it.

2350
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:17,626
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think a lot of people are like you, and, you know, if they're real, true fans of the series, they would buy an official translation anyway, but do you think there's some people that would feel so slighted that once they played through the translation, they're just gonna be like, yeah, screw the real one.

2351
02:35:17,646 --> 02:35:32,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's a good... That's a good point, like, kind of like when I... Like, I used to download a lot of, like, the money songs, they're, like, buying them, so I was like, nah, screw buying the real thing, I'll just...

2352
02:35:32,833 --> 02:35:33,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it.

2353
02:35:33,514 --> 02:35:33,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2354
02:35:34,394 --> 02:35:34,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2355
02:35:35,035 --> 02:35:35,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2356
02:35:35,455 --> 02:35:36,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially with the import stuff.

2357
02:35:37,216 --> 02:35:38,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess we will see.

2358
02:35:38,797 --> 02:35:41,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very curious to see if it does catch the attention of people in Nintendo.

2359
02:35:41,999 --> 02:35:44,381
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm waiting for the cease and desist myself, but we'll see.

2360
02:35:45,362 --> 02:35:46,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, GS68?

2361
02:35:47,063 --> 02:35:47,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2362
02:35:49,485 --> 02:35:50,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky, you went to Milpitas Golf Land.

2363
02:35:50,886 --> 02:35:52,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, we need to come down to Sunnyvale Golf Land again.

2364
02:35:53,948 --> 02:35:54,648
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I know.

2365
02:35:54,748 --> 02:35:55,889
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew I was in the area.

2366
02:35:56,290 --> 02:35:59,192
[SPEAKER_12]: It worked out so that we were at Milpitas, and I didn't make it over there.

2367
02:35:59,232 --> 02:36:01,553
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'll get to Sunnyvale at some point, I'm sure.

2368
02:36:01,853 --> 02:36:02,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, maybe...

2369
02:36:03,484 --> 02:36:05,985
[SPEAKER_08]: NorCal Division of the All-Army can meet up there.

2370
02:36:06,345 --> 02:36:07,226
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see, we'll see.

2371
02:36:07,286 --> 02:36:11,827
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, with the surgery coming up and everything, it won't be anytime soon, but who knows, maybe by the end of the year.

2372
02:36:13,368 --> 02:36:18,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was saying, maybe we should be going to Svega lately for Poppin' 16.

2373
02:36:19,010 --> 02:36:20,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, hey, I like poppin' music.

2374
02:36:20,711 --> 02:36:22,131
[SPEAKER_12]: It's certainly better than Beatin' Groovy.

2375
02:36:23,972 --> 02:36:25,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I've gotten back into it recently.

2376
02:36:26,348 --> 02:36:27,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's fun.

2377
02:36:27,428 --> 02:36:28,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I might get a job.

2378
02:36:30,390 --> 02:36:37,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm possibly getting a job where I might use the money to get a desktop arcade so I can play the real thing at home instead of freaking 9K 2DX.

2379
02:36:38,953 --> 02:36:40,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Good times, good times.

2380
02:36:41,254 --> 02:36:49,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish I... Of course, then again, I'm like, I wish I had that kind of disposable income, but then again, I'm looking at my new iPhone when I'm saying that.

2381
02:36:50,418 --> 02:36:51,378
[SPEAKER_12]: We all have priorities.

2382
02:36:51,678 --> 02:36:53,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, GS6 here, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, buddy.

2383
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:55,080
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

2384
02:37:19,031 --> 02:37:20,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, you always have something for Last Minute Stories.

2385
02:37:21,132 --> 02:37:22,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, a few more things real quick.

2386
02:37:23,194 --> 02:37:29,118
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that Guitar Hero, they're talking about making God knows how many games next year for it.

2387
02:37:29,218 --> 02:37:32,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's yet another one that's been discovered.

2388
02:37:32,920 --> 02:37:38,644
[SPEAKER_13]: A trademark has recently been placed for the title Guitar Hero Modern Hits.

2389
02:37:39,705 --> 02:37:44,648
[SPEAKER_13]: And no word on exactly what that is, but... Of course, the term hit is relative.

2390
02:37:45,069 --> 02:37:45,649
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

2391
02:37:46,009 --> 02:37:46,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It's...

2392
02:37:48,482 --> 02:37:48,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

2393
02:37:49,222 --> 02:37:51,484
[SPEAKER_13]: If I were to take a guess, I think it's another DS version.

2394
02:37:51,944 --> 02:37:53,465
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like a DS version to me.

2395
02:37:53,745 --> 02:37:54,345
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good point.

2396
02:37:54,525 --> 02:37:54,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably is.

2397
02:37:54,826 --> 02:37:55,466
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty vague.

2398
02:37:57,547 --> 02:37:57,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

2399
02:37:58,388 --> 02:38:08,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to Xbox Live Marketplace as an Xbox original starting, well, actually this Monday, October 20th.

2400
02:38:09,054 --> 02:38:14,217
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll be able to download the full game for $15 or 1,200 Microsoft points.

2401
02:38:14,677 --> 02:38:15,337
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool.

2402
02:38:16,318 --> 02:38:16,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

2403
02:38:17,552 --> 02:38:18,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Fable 2.

2404
02:38:19,893 --> 02:38:22,995
[SPEAKER_13]: You should definitely go to Microsoft's website.

2405
02:38:23,015 --> 02:38:24,957
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a special website made for Fable 2.

2406
02:38:25,997 --> 02:38:26,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Xbox.com.

2407
02:38:27,238 --> 02:38:29,019
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe you just go to the Fable 2 page.

2408
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:33,502
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a little game that you can play, including Chicken Kickin'.

2409
02:38:34,222 --> 02:38:38,545
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can actually win prizes for your in-game character.

2410
02:38:38,985 --> 02:38:42,967
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can win gold and different prizes in Fable 2.

2411
02:38:43,868 --> 02:38:44,548
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2412
02:39:09,963 --> 02:39:12,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so interesting.

2413
02:39:12,504 --> 02:39:13,865
[SPEAKER_13]: Area 51, the movie.

2414
02:39:14,445 --> 02:39:16,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully it's cheesy and motion captured.

2415
02:39:18,567 --> 02:39:26,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Then there's going to be some new download content for Mega Man 9 coming soon, including a brand new bonus level with a bonus boss, Fake Man.

2416
02:39:27,751 --> 02:39:31,392
[SPEAKER_13]: And you'll be able to purchase that for 100 Wii Points.

2417
02:39:31,552 --> 02:39:33,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it not be impossibly hard?

2418
02:39:34,134 --> 02:39:34,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably not.

2419
02:39:35,834 --> 02:39:37,354
[SPEAKER_13]: but it's a brand new special stage.

2420
02:39:37,494 --> 02:39:40,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, I can't play that game.

2421
02:39:40,675 --> 02:39:48,196
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, to kind of talk a little bit about another game that we'll be seeing a little bit more pretty soon, LittleBigPlanet.

2422
02:39:48,216 --> 02:39:50,196
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually have some more videos from the beta.

2423
02:39:50,236 --> 02:39:55,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone has actually recreated some of the levels from Mirror's Edge in this game.

2424
02:39:56,157 --> 02:40:05,579
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can actually play some of the Mirror's Edge levels in the beta and of course the full game when it comes out because all those levels are being transferred over which is pretty freaking awesome.

2425
02:40:07,577 --> 02:40:07,977
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

2426
02:40:09,479 --> 02:40:15,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but before we finish the show tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2427

02:41:25,983 --> 02:41:26,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

2448
02:41:26,903 --> 02:41:29,225

2450
02:41:33,928 --> 02:41:37,549

2451
02:41:37,569 --> 02:41:38,449
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how we spread the word.

2452
02:41:38,470 --> 02:41:45,973
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you don't have any friends, just kidding, even if you do, you should post a review on our iTunes on the store.

2453
02:41:46,033 --> 02:41:47,933
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll post the link in chat for our live listeners.

2454
02:41:48,013 --> 02:41:52,735
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not listening live, you should go search for it in iTunes and leave us a nice five-star review.

02:41:52,855 --> 02:41:54,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, every little bit helps.

2456
02:41:54,756 --> 02:41:56,237
[SPEAKER_12]: The more listeners we have, the better.

2457
02:41:56,297 --> 02:41:58,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's not about awards.

2458
02:41:59,502 --> 02:42:00,362
