Orange, Lounge, Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tonight, October 19th, 2008

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
LittleBigPlanet generates some big controversy

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Download content comes to SoulCalibur 4 that will surprise no one

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 soon be re-released?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange, Lounge, Radio

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm sorry to hear that

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I guess we'll have some good rants tonight

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Careful Chat

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I didn't do it, did I?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You love me, right?

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's groups of people

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Maybe we'll catch on a little bit about what's going on later

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If I don't feel better about it by then

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, we'll see

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Also, say hello to the one and only Loki

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How are you, Techmaster? Loki?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm fine

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are you having a good week?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Are you mad at certain groups of people too?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Maybe

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're perpetually mad at somebody

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I'm just kidding

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Alright, I feel fine

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm having a good week

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not really mad at anybody

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, I guess that's a lie

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm mad at some people

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But I look past it

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
For the sake of the show

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where we talk about just the games

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And kick them back and have a little bit of fun

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And in order to talk about the games

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We gotta talk about our gaming weeks

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And what we've been doing lately

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000

Is where we are reading comments from you guys

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In our chat room

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
On this lovely Sunday evening

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As we always do when we tape live

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alright, let's start off

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
DarkSakura

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How was your gaming week?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I played Rock Band 2 and Ragnarok Online

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How was Rock Band 2?

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It was very good

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah?

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What is your instrument of preference in Rock Band 2?

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't have one

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You like to play a little bit of everything?

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I really don't prefer to play

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, you like to watch?

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, my shoulder hurt

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And I was in a lot of pain

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So they made me play bass on a song

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Gotcha

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Alright, well, hey

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How did you like it compared to the first one?

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I saw no difference

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's more Rock Band

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, more

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
More songs, I mean, that was okay

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But, you know, I wasn't

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It wasn't anything to be impressed or

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Displeased over

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was just more Rock Band

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Alright

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, if there's nothing else

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then we'll move on to Loki

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How was your gaming week?

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hi

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, the clothes in it suck

78
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Better Barbie mode in the first game

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well, they actually still have some of the same

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Clothes from the first game and the second game

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Didn't really add that much

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The GWAR outfits were kind of neat

84
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's see, this week I played

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Singing Zero 2, actually

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm thinking about

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Almost 50% done with the game

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It says I'm only like 37%

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or maybe it's 47% done

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Basically, I've gone through two of the gangs already

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've finished the Brotherhood and the Son of Samedi

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That was a weird gang

94
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And then finally now I'm starting to run in a little bit

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't know, it's pretty cool

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I still think, though, out of the three gangs so far

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The Brotherhood have been

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think that storyline was the most brutal that was in it

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Played a little bit of the multiplayer

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And they actually have a game mode

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's pretty awesome

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It kind of mixes up

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Different modes of the single player game

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Some of the activities it can do with multiplayer

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So basically it's team based

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You start off and you have about a minute

108
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's just pure deathmatch

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then an activity will start

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So the first game I played, there was a mayhem activity

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So basically

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have to go and destroy as many things as possible

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Just the environment, cars, other people, etc.

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And so we did that

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And then after about, say, five minutes or so

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The activity stops

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then there's a break in between it

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Like another minute where it's just a deathmatch

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then a new activity will start

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then the new activity, I think, was insurance fraud

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So we had to throw ourselves in front of cars and stuff like that

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Or you can hit your own teammates and you get points for that

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But all along, while this is going on

124
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There's also different tags you can spray paint

125
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To give your teams different abilities

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Like double damage or double money for killing other gang members

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Or a smokescreen, stuff like that

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So really cool gameplay

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The actual deathmatch mode's pretty fun

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Doing some of that

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I like the shopping mall level that they have

132
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's kind of fun to play around in

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then, what else did I play?

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I got a random off-the-wall question for you about Saints Row 2

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I know we have a news story coming up later on

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
About some of the controversy this game is generating

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Which game do you think is more violent

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And has more potential for controversy?

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This game or Grand Theft Auto?

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Seeing as they're very similar and appeal to the same audience

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Maybe this game a little bit

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because they don't really get into

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I mean, there's corrupt police in Grand Theft Auto 4

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In this game you can actually dress up or impersonate a cop

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
In this fictional cops type show

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Called, I forget what it's called now

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But it's, oh, The Fuzz

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's what the show's called

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And you basically go around beating up

150
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Like Hot Fuzz?

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You go around beating up people dressed up as cops

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
While they're filming it and stuff

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And it's one of the activities

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Unless there's a level where you break into a police station

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Do a bunch of stuff like that

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If anything, I'd say Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think was more

159
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Kind of showing cops in a bad light

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But both games, I mean, the kill count

161
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
As far as police officers go

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is going to be pretty high

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I would think if anything Grand Theft Auto

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Might be a little bit higher just because

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You don't really have gang members chasing after you

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
In Grand Theft Auto, it's mainly just the police

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Whereas in Saints Row, you have gang members

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And the police chasing after you

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So, you know, just out of sheer numbers

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think Grand Theft Auto 4, probably the percentage

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Of police officers killed would be a lot larger

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You know, I'm somehow not surprised by that answer

173
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because I would think if I'm the designers

174
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Behind Saints Row 2

175
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I want to kind of break through that

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know, ceiling that Grand Theft Auto

177
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Has kind of put out there where, you know, Grand Theft Auto

178
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is the creme de la creme of these sandbox games

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know, it's by far and wide the most popular

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm not surprised if I'm the developers of Saints Row 2

181
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And the people behind this game

182
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I know one of the best ways I'm going to get at

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And get close to that number is to one up

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The controversy they're doing

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Because that's half the reason why Grand Theft Auto sells

186
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
God, people need to understand

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's fiction, it's not like

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I go and go shoot the cops in the game

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Because I wish I could go shoot real cops

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean, that's not what happens

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's just the opposition

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It could be Nazis running this entire city

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And it doesn't matter

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If, you know, they're still coming after you

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, it's funny

196
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That you mention that, you know, this might seem completely random

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But it is related, you know, I was at the movies

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The other day and they were showing that little

199
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's that thing they do before? Like, you know how they play commercials

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Like 20 minutes while people walk in

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, whatever it's called, the 20

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, I was only like half watching and I was kind of distracted

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Talking to somebody else and I look at the screen and go

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Oh, what's this movie? This looks neat

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then, like, I saw some guy that looked like they were on fire

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I'm like, wow, I'm kind of surprised I can show that in a trailer

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It was Fable 2

208
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like, I thought it was like an actual movie coming out

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But it was a Fable 2 commercial

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I mean, games are getting...

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They've come a long way since combat, let's put it that way

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But, yeah, I mean, it's just if

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, if you want to look at it like it's realistic

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Or something like that, then yeah, okay, sure

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I guess it's offensive to cops or something

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But you have to understand, games aren't meant to be

218
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A simulation for real life

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I mean, granted, you can make a game that's like

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A simulation of real life

221
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you want, but then again, you can also make

222
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Pure fiction that's just way over the top

223
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Which is what Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto are doing

224
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You know, to an extent

225
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And Grand Theft Auto is a little bit more grounded

226
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But still, it's pretty over the top

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't know

228
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's just

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can find controversy anywhere

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And then, the other game I've played

231
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Which also has controversy, I guess, involved with it

232
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Would be Little Big Planet

233
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And Little Big Planet is amazing

234
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's easy to say

235
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I mean, it's just an amazing game

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The fact, from the very beginning of the game

237
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Even through the title credits sequence

238
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Which I might add is all in-game engine

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's just incredible

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's just all of the stuff that was actually

241
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In the game was made with the creator

242
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
In the game

243
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, you know, just going through

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Each of the levels of stuff in there

245
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They kind of have a basic tutorial

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
To walk you through of how to play the game

247
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
As time goes on

248
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Each level, they actually have a storyline

250
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That continues on

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And it's really, really cool

252
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mildly offensive, but really, really cool

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I think some of the levels are

254
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
As we were talking about during the break

255
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
They're characters of

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Different sections of the world

257
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, like, the African level

258
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Is all like

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Think Lion King, basically

260
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Whereas the

261
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
British level

262
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is the

263
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
British levels

264
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Are all knights in castles

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And that kind of thing

266
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it's a little bit racist

267
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But in the way that it's a small world

268
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Is racist, where no one's gonna possibly be offended

269
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Because it's so damn cute

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's incredibly cute

271
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's incredibly cute

272
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now, my thing with Sony, if they were smart

273
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This sucker would be

274
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
In the next bundle that they're doing

275
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This would be a bundle that's out

276
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This holiday

277
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They need to be bundling this game with the system

278
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Because I'm telling you, this game will sell systems

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Easy. You just get this out

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
People are gonna look at this and they're like

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh my god, you know, that's just an amazing game

282
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's way more amazing than Wii Sports

283
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And I think it's gonna appeal to everybody

284
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Game of the year?

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It could definitely be a contender

286
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
For game of the year

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Anything else in your gaming week this week?

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Umm

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No.

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I hate to take it back to Saints Row because you talk about that game an awful lot

291
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But, a good question from chatroom

292
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
At chat.orangesonsrady.com

293
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
First chat comment of the night goes to C-more Booty

294
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Since you guys are talking about Saints Row 2

295
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you having any problems with crashing or freezing

296
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In the game? It crashes my system every time

297
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I try to save manually

298
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Umm, not really

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've had it lock up a few times

300
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But it's just random

301
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I mean, it's just like any other game

302
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's...

303
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know, I haven't really had any problems saving manually

304
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because I do it all the time

305
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to quit or something

306
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
At that time

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, not really any problems with it

308
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Alright

309
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff this week

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Sadly, I'm sorry to disappoint

311
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But I've had a lot going on in my personal life

312
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But I will say this, the new WoW 3.0 patch came out this week

313
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Of course WoW being World of Warcraft

314
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Had a huge content upgrade this week

315
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And you guys know I'm the resident Warcraft addict

316
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
On staff here

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Just having a lot of fun with that

318
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There's been a lot of new things added into the game

319
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
With regards to talents

320
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know how much I mentioned this on the show

321
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But I play a balanced druid as my main character

322
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And so our class really got a lot of love

323
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We have some new talents that are just awesome

324
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I was using Starfall and PvP today and it's great

325
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And one of my favorite new talents is something called Typhoon

326
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Where when you click it, it's like this big blue sploosh

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That goes across the screen and everybody gets knocked back

328
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So it's kind of awesome to use

329
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That and PvP around the world

330
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So, achievements as well have finally

331
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Come to World of Warcraft and a lot of time

332
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Kind of spent getting the achievements and new titles

333
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
To come with them

334
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
One of the first things my guild did as soon as the patch went live

335
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Probably about an hour of the patch going live

336
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We went back to Ubers and the old WoW content

337
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And got ourselves the Jenkins title

338
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Because you can now, you know

339
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WoW has this funny way of working in pop culture references

340
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
About WoW into WoW

341
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And this whole Leroy Jenkins thing

342
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is now Leroy is an achievement

343
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And if you get that achievement you can have Jenkins as your title

344
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So that you're like, you know, if your character name is

345
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sky

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You would be Sky Jenkins

347
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which is kind of funny

348
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So there you go

349
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Other than Warcraft and experiencing the new patch

350
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I actually, I took a trip

351
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And you folks that have been listening to the show for a long time

352
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Since we were about music games will appreciate this

353
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And you guys here in studio

354
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I went to Milpitas Golf Land this week

355
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I went to good old Miggle

356
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's changed a lot

357
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Since, you know, I hadn't been there in quite a few years

358
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Last time I was there I think they still had Derby Owners Club

359
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Which is now at our Miggle

360
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And at Milpitas Golf Land

361
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You know, you have to remember

362
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is like the holy land of

363
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
BeatMania and the Bobani

364
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Between Milpitas and Sunnyvale Golf Land

365
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know, these were

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I guess you could say Arcade Infinity to an extent

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It was like the trinity of California

368
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Northern California

369
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Arcade Infinity is southern technically

370
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You know what I mean though

371
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's like one of the west coast hubs

372
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Of where DDR got big

373
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And it's interesting to see, you know how

374
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Milpitas

375
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Used to have DDR in one of the rooms

376
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That room, it's like two rooms

377
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This arcade is like two separate buildings

378
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
One building now is nothing but ticket games

379
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Like I remember when we were first

380
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Going there, like half of it was ticket redemption

381
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It was slowly spreading, well now it is

382
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Nothing but ticket redemption in one room

383
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But it's interesting because they've turned the other room into

384
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You know, like all the music

385
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Games are on one wall

386
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Then all the driving games are over here

387
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And all the fighting games are over here

388
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So it's kind of like you have just different little sections

389
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was kind of interesting, but I did play

390
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I played Midnight Maximum Tune 3

391
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I played Keyboard Mania

392
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Even though it was sticking on the keyboard

393
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But a new game I played, Dance Dance Revolution

394
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Supernova 2, it's been out this whole time

395
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And I have not yet played it in arcades

396
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And it was really the same damn thing as the last game

397
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There wasn't much difference

398
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Just some new songs, yippee

399
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And some little flashy graphics when you get combos

400
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Forgot to let you know

401
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is totally local news

402
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Remember that one store that we went to

403
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's right there by the Folsom Theater

404
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The Gamer's Empire, whatever

405
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They got a Supernova machine now

406
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Oh, nice

407
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's untouched, you know, basically

408
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Nice, well this is the other thing that surprised me

409
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Miggle is selling their DDR Extreme machine

410
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They have a little sign on it that says

411
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
For Sale, guess how much they want for this

412
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Miggle machine, DDR Extreme machine

413
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
As is

414
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
$12,000

415
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, a little high, very high in fact

416
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's a used machine, no much higher

417
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
$8,000

418
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A little lower

419
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
$7,000

420
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
$6,000 is what they want for this machine

421
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
$5,999 to be exact

422
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
If you can take the machine, retrofit it

423
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And upgrade it, I mean

424
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's always interesting

425
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So that was it, and then I actually played miniature golf

426
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Which in all the times I've ever been to Milpitas Golf Line

427
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I never have played miniature golf there

428
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But I did this time

429
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So there you go

430
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Miniature golf, the real game

431
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's it, not a lot of whole other console games I've been playing

432
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Just, you know, experiencing wow this week

433
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And, you know, some of the same old console stuff I've been playing

434
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Like Rock Band and all that, good stuff

435
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick

436
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It is episode number 299 tonight

437
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Which means next week is episode number 300

438
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you can believe it

439
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And what we want you guys to do is

440
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We want you to leave your messages for us

441
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We're going to play them during next week's commercial break

442
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you want to say a few words about Orange Launch Radio

443
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Just try to keep it a minute or less

444
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You can call the Skype line anytime when we're not live

445
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't call right now if you're listening live on Sunday night

446
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But if you're listening to this in the podcast format

447
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Give 1-877-GAME-OLR a call

448
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And leave us a message about

449
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What you think about us making episode 300

450
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And we'll play it on the break next week

451
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Otherwise, it's going to be a good old fashioned show

452
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You never know what kind of guest might show up

453
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Also, we have some games planned for next week

454
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It'll be a good time, there you have it

455
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, and something that

456
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Loki has a huge surprise, we'll say that

457
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
We'll say that much, Loki has a huge surprise

458
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And let's see, what else do we have coming up?

459
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you've been listening to the show this year

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know I've had some medical issues going on

461
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm going to be having surgery right after episode 300

462
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So we probably won't be having a show the next week

463
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So we might have a little bit of a break after episode 300

464
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We'll have more details on that next week, that's all

465
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So we'll talk about that

466
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And don't worry, the surgery is nothing major

467
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's gallbladder surgery, a million people have had it done

468
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not that worried about it

469
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I just kind of want to get it over with at this point

470
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So, that's it for housekeeping

471
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Visit our MySpace, visit our Facebook

472
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Visit our live journal, our Twitter

473
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's get into tonight's gaming news

474
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Loki, start us off

475
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yes, anyways

476
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So, this is kind of interesting

477
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Not too surprising because they haven't been doing well financially for a while now

478
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But Infogrames has finally now finished purchasing Atari

479
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
They made an $11 million stock purchase of Atari

480
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And previously they had owned 51.4%

481
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But now they are done with the purchase

482
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And we'll see where they take it

483
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hopefully in the right direction

484
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And not, I don't know, into the red again

485
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is the same company that brought us the Epic 2600

486
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And my how times have changed, right?

487
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This is kind of, I don't know, kind of sad in a way

488
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But you kind of saw it coming

489
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Because what has Atari done in the past five years

490
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's been really huge

491
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Besides maybe their flashback consoles

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Which are really cool, actually

493
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Dragon Ball Z

494
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I guess, alright

495
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But, I don't know, in a way it's kind of the end of an era

496
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Did I say error?

497
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No, I'm thinking of something else

498
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The end of an era, you know what I mean?

499
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
So, it's kind of sad, but there you go

500
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Hey, LittleBigPlanet has been stirring up a lot of talk this week

501
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And one thing that's got people talking about LittleBigPlanet

502
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Is the new license agreement that Sony has

503
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Sony actually recently changed the PlayStation Network terms of use

504
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And basically to make a long story short

505
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Long story short

506
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Sony says now in the user license agreement

507
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You also authorize us and our affiliated companies without payment to you

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
To license, sell, and otherwise commercially exploit your user material

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So if you don't like it, don't use it

510
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If you create a LittleBigPlanet level in the game

511
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And Sony decides they're going to sell it on a compilation later on

512
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Like maybe a best of for people that don't have online access

513
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
As I could possibly see forthcoming depending on how big this game is

514
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Too bad you're not getting any money for it

515
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And if you don't like it, don't play the game

516
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You know, I like how they actually have exploit in there

517
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
An interesting word

518
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I will rape your mother!

519
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What? I don't know

520
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't think that'll be a LittleBigPlanet level

521
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Could be

522
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's kind of not surprising

523
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I know a lot of people are looking at this as a

524
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh my gosh, Sony is so big, bad, and evil corporate

525
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But is it really that surprising in a way?

526
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No

527
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Not really

528
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I would hope that they still give you credit for it at least

529
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Or say, hey, you know, it's going to be in here

530
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
At least send you a free copy of the game, shit

531
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's the least they could do

532
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I mean a lot of people would probably be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put it in there

533
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I mean, I don't think they

534
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know, I would be like

535
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hell yeah, go ahead and put that in there, just give me credit

536
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But if you don't like it, you don't like it, don't use it

537
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Don't play the game

538
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I guess, I mean

539
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know, if you were really expecting to profit off LittleBigPlanet

540
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think you might be playing the game for the wrong reasons, right?

541
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah

542
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't know

543
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Anyhow, we'll see how Sony plans to exploit user-created levels pretty soon

544
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, moving on to

545
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know if this

546
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, exploitation just really isn't the best word for this

547
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I call it hypocrisy

548
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But, you know, as we discussed with Bobby earlier

549
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Speaking of which

550
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is

551
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
LittleBigPlanet is being recalled

552
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because of religious content within the game

553
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And technically, what it is

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Is two expressions from the Quran

555
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Have made it into the game by means of a song that was licensed to be in the game

556
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That came out a few years ago

557
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And one person in the beta found it

558
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And apparently took offense to its presence

559
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
And therefore wrote a letter to Sony

560
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Which I have right here

561
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Because I love pulling up, you know

562
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Archived content off of message boards after posts have been deleted for days

563
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I'm not even going to bother pronouncing any of the Arabic

564
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Because I can't

565
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We'll play the clip in a little bit

566
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Well, this is to Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule

567
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
While playing your latest game LittleBigPlanet

568
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
In the first level of the third world in the game titled Swinging Safari Smiley Wink

569
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I've noticed something strange in the lyrics of the music track of the level

570
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
When I listened carefully

571
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I hit the fair by accident

572
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
When I listened carefully

573
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I was surprised to hear some very familiar Arabic words from the Quran

574
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You can listen to the track here

575
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We'll play it in a second

576
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The words are in the 18th second

577
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's to translate

578
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Every soul shall have the taste of death

579
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And to almost immediately after in the 27th second

580
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
All that is on earth will perish

581
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I asked many of my friends online and offline

582
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And they had heard the exact same thing I heard easily

583
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
When I played that part of the track

584
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Certain Arabic hardcore gaming forums are already discussing this

585
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So we decided to take action by emailing you before this spreads to mainstream attention

586
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
TOO LATE

587
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our holy Quran deeply offending

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We hope you would remove the track from the game immediately via an online patch

589
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And make sure that all future shipments of the game do not contain it

590
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We'd also like to mention this isn't the first time something like this has happened in video games

591
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Nintendo's 1998 hit Zelda Ocarina of Time contained a musical track with Islamic phrases

592
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And was removed in later shipments of the game after Nintendo was contacted by Muslim organizations

593
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Last year Capcom, Zach and Wiki and Activision's Call of Duty 4

594
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Also contained objectionable material offensive to Muslims that was spotted before the release of the final games

595
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And both companies thankfully removed the content

596
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
We hope that you act immediately to avoid any confusion and necessary controversy

597
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
And we thank you for making such an amazing game

598
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Now I think the letter was very well worded

599
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
However, I'm going to go back and read a particular line from this, if I may

600
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our holy Quran deeply offending

601
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So why aren't you offended at the artist that, you know, recorded the song in the first place?

602
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Don't you think that's just a little bit of hypocrisy right there?

603
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I mean, shouldn't you actually take issue up with the songwriter who, by the way, is Muslim, right?

604
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yeah, and the song has been out since 2006

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Exactly, so why don't you do your homework first?

606
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay, and to be honest, I mean, who is this really offending?

607
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not like, you know, death to America, woohoo!

608
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You know, it's not, there's nothing like that

609
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I mean, most people are not going to know what it means

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They're just going to hear it and they're going to say, hey, that sounds African

611
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Hey, that fits with the level in the game

612
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Because that's what I heard and that's what I thought

613
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm like, hell, this song is fucking awesome

614
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So put this in context to the game of why this music would be here in the first place

615
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Like, you know, in the Africa level you hear African style music

616
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
In the South America level you hear South American style music

617
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So in the, you know, in a level that's appropriate you hear this music

618
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's world music, basically, so you're traveling to different parts of the world

619
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But somehow this slipped under the radar where, you know, people didn't realize that this could be offensive

620
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Even though the song's been out there for a while when nothing's said

621
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Well, keep in mind also, this is what I drew a parallel to

622
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Why aren't Christian groups being offended at Rock Band 2 for having System of a Down in it?

623
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
They probably are

624
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
They probably are

625
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Why did the game come out then with that song in it if people are going to be offended?

626
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Probably because Christian groups don't care because they have their own music with lines for the Bible

627
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And they're, you know, it's Christian rock

628
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And they're just like, hell yeah, spread the word, you know, but, um

629
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
But it's the same equivalent is what I'm saying

630
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But I'm just sorry, I mean

631
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
If I get, you know, pissed off, okay, if something I find offensive in a game and I write Sony a letter

632
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They're going to be like, fuck off

633
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
If I say I'm Arab, then they're like, oh, oh, now we're going to listen to you

634
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Double fucking standard

635
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I disagree, I disagree, I completely disagree

636
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And especially something that's going on in the country

637
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Especially over here is that we're seeing people catering to different ethnic groups

638
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Because of this whole perception of oppression

639
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
That really should not exist in America in the modern world

640
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I am going to put together a letter then to Sony and Media Monocle

641
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And I'm going to tell them how deeply offended I am that they are censoring the game

642
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
You know, when, I don't understand why if we offend one person

643
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I don't get why it's a big deal if we're offended

644
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I actually do wonder how Sony would have reacted if the letter came that had absolutely no reference to the person sending it being Muslim

645
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Or if they specifically said, I am not Muslim, however

646
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Their reaction would have been different

647
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There is a freaking double standard, I'm sorry

648
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm going to, just to give some context to this

649
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm going to play the clip from this game

650
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's hit the gaming blog, somebody recorded it off their phone

651
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm going to give credit where credit is due

652
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We pulled this from Kotaku where I believe one of their users got the sound clip and posted it on the site there

653
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm going to play it, if you think for whatever reason this might offend you

654
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I urge you to not listen to the next minute of the program

655
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But I just want to give this some context

656
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And so that our listeners can understand kind of where the controversy might be spreading from

657
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm going to play the clip

658
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:58,000
So it definitely sets a certain type of world mood, right, this music

659
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And there's an awful lot of ignorant Americans out there that are not going to know anything what was just said

660
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Not going to know any of that, just going to think, oh it matches the mood

661
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I know three words in Arabic and I couldn't say them off the top of my head

662
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So how was that?

663
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Look, I want to present a different opinion here

664
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Because I think although I do see the overreaction going on here a little bit

665
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And I think you're right, there are other religious things that are offensive that are in video games

666
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I think in a way Sony's doing us all a favor by pulling this game

667
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Is it a little bit hypersensitive? Yes, but is it Sony's fault? No

668
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Whose fault is it? The media's fault

669
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Because unfortunately if this had gone out and the wrong person had heard about it

670
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And instead CNN, Al Jazeera, MSNBC gets a letter about this

671
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Then it's suddenly going to be all over the mainstream press that

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh my gosh, video games are teaching children passages from the Quran

673
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And it's over, you know what I mean at that point

674
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's just another outrage of the violence in games and the messages that games are teaching us

675
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Now it's religious text

676
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Well who's going to say that it's not going to happen anyways?

677
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And now let's see, how about the people representing Mexico saying that they don't like the way that Mexicans are portrayed in this game

678
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Or how about the way that South America is portrayed in this game

679
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Or how about the way that, you know

680
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I see Sony sees smoke and they're trying to put out the fire before it spreads

681
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I kind of, and forgive me for going to a comedian on this one

682
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But I kind of want to quote Carlos Mencia about talking about people being offended about the Taco Bell dog

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He's like, the Taco Bell dog sends out messages for people that Mexicans are stupid

684
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
He's like, no, it's sending out messages to buy more tacos

685
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You know, it's people looking to be offended at something

686
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's people that are trying to find an excuse to, I really do think it's people just trying to find some sort of excuse

687
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
To put a little drama into their lives, to break up the monotony

688
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Instead of trying to just say, hey, it's in there, I don't care

689
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You know, why, it's not, if you're going to be offended at it being in the game

690
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Be offended at the person that recorded the song to begin with

691
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And in a way, yeah, I'm kind of like, well, where is the stink about this back in 2006

692
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But then again, us being gamers, you know, maybe we didn't hear about it

693
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Maybe there was a fuss and we didn't hear about it, I don't know

694
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
But I highly doubt there was or, you know, it would have been on the news

695
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And I think all of us watch the news on a regular enough basis

696
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
We would have heard something about it, especially considering the guy who recorded this won a Grammy

697
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
However, I don't think the mainstream media would have given a fuck

698
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think they would have placed blame on the game

699
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And I think Sony is just trying to put out that fire

700
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's sad, but that's the world we live in

701
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It sucks, but

702
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No, I agree with you that Sony is straight

703
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But I also do think that it would not have gotten as much attention from Sony

704
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Had it not specifically said, I and other Muslims are offended by this

705
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Because we do have that double standard

706
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
That if you are some sort of oppressed group, and I say oppressed in quotes

707
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That you automatically have to have someone throw you a bone

708
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I'm sorry, that's not how it works

709
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Was this dude like the only Muslim person playing this game?

710
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You know, in the beta or something?

711
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It was one person in the beta, he posted about it

712
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And found other people in his religious group that were equally offended

713
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Were they playing the game?

714
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I have a hard time believing he was the one and only Muslim in the beta

715
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No, that's what I just said

716
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
He was talking to other people in other forums like he said in his letter

717
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
To his credit, his letter was well worded and very respectful

718
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
That I do have to commend him on

719
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
And he wasn't asking for the game to be recalled

720
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And I don't think we're placing any of the blame on this guy at all for maybe bringing it to light

721
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I believe it specifically said, future releases not contain it

722
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Patch the first releases, future printings, don't include it

723
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's acceptable, and that's part of what the beta is there for

724
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
To weed out offensive material, to weed out bugs

725
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
To make sure that you're releasing clean, safe content

726
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Relative to the content you're releasing, you know what I mean?

727
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
To be honest, that's about the equivalent of what they would have done had, granted that I was San Andreas, come out on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3

728
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
They would have patched it, and then they would have made sure that all additional copies would not contain that content

729
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
But I am going to, like I said before, I don't know that Sony

730
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think he was right

731
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
The guy who sent the letter was right to voice his concern

732
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If he felt like it was a big enough concern, he was right to voice it

733
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Because what's one thing that I always say?

734
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Nothing changes until you put forth the effort to make it change, am I correct?

735
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I think though that the recall should be voluntary

736
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Because if you are offended by it, then yes

737
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They should give you the opportunity to send in your copy of the game so that you don't have to hear that

738
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But if a person like me, who thinks the song is pretty kick-ass and doesn't really care what it says

739
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Wants to keep it, then I don't see what the big deal is

740
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And see, that's part of what I-

741
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Because now they're oppressing me and my desire to have this song in the game

742
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
For my own personal use

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And they're oppressing me to benefit somebody else

744
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
That is my problem

745
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't have a problem with someone being offended by it and they're fixing it for them

746
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
But I want to be able to keep my game the way it is

747
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's the point I was getting to

748
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
If you are offended by something, then sure

749
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
They should give you the option to remove the offensive content

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
But for those who are not offended by it, those who don't care

751
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's pointless

752
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You're wasting time and money

753
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You could just put out a patch

754
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Why should one-

755
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Because one group of people is offended by content that does not offend

756
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Now, especially when the content is not attacking another group

757
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Now if this was content that was saying

758
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
We hate all of so-and-such's group, kill them all

759
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Then, yes, it should be removed, don't you think?

760
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
But if it's just something, not even a specific statement just saying

761
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh, well one day the Earth is gone and all this stuff is gonna happen

762
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Well it's just like reading Revelations, really

763
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I mean, that-

764
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's nothing that's directed towards a party that anyone who is not in that faith

765
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Would really get the reference to

766
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You know, I just don't think there's an easy answer to this

767
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I think this whole story is just a reflection of the world we live in

768
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
People are just too fucking offended

769
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I know

770
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
But you know, I'm sitting here thinking, it's live radio

771
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And sometimes I'm giving a lot of these stories a lot of thought

772
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
As we're sitting here talking about them

773
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And I'm thinking, there's a story coming up later in the show in Part B

774
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Where we're gonna talk about something that's coming out in an upcoming game

775
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
That kind of offends me a little bit

776
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And although I can take offense, I know how to be offended or whatever

777
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's just kind of one of those things where, gosh

778
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You know, even I look at some of the things that happen in video games

779
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
And I go, this is so stupid

780
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Like, I wish games would kind of learn how to, I don't know

781
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Address some of these things more appropriately

782
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And in a way I feel like a hypocrite kind of sitting here going

783
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You know, well everybody should just kind of learn to deal with it

784
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
When I'm thinking about, well come think of it

785
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
There are some things in video games that offend me

786
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
And exactly, but do you think that you would get equal representation

787
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
If you had emailed that company that makes that game

788
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Hell to the no

789
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Exactly, exactly my damn point

790
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm sorry, there's, what about Redneck Rampage, okay?

791
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Now while I personally don't consider myself to be a redneck

792
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I do consider quite a number of my relatives to be purely

793
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Jeff Foxworthy defines redneck as someone completely lacking in sophistication

794
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I agree, that's most of my family

795
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Not my immediate, but aunts and uncles and cousins and what have you

796
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Anyway, but then, so if I said, you know, I'm from, you know

797
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Mobile, Alabama and I'm offended at this game

798
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Or I'm offended at how you've portrayed this southern person in this game as being stupid

799
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Just because they talk a little slower and have a thick accent

800
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That doesn't mean that their IQ is any lower than anybody else's

801
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know, I could say I'm offended at that

802
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Or I could just laugh and go, I'm related to people like that

803
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Which is basically my opinion towards Larry the Cable Guy

804
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Basically, just watch South Park, there was that one episode basically saying

805
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You know, about pulling a family guy off TV

806
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
If you do it for one person, then what's, you know, you have to do it for everybody

807
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know, I don't know, I don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open

808
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But what the hell, we're here, we do this show for a reason to talk about things

809
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
But, you know, the story I want to talk about later has to do with an upcoming game

810
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That just reinforces gay stereotypes I wish would go away

811
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You know, and as a gay man, it gets really old after a while

812
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
You know, seeing some of these gay stereotypes in games

813
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So I just kind of sit here and go, God, I wish I would just, you know, fucking grow up

814
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You know, some of these people that program the games

815
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So I'm thinking to myself, but at the same time, you know, maybe there's people that are Arab

816
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
That are sick of some of these stereotypes that are in the game

817
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
About, you know, the, you know, the verses that are being said

818
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't know, you know, in a way, I just don't want to be a hypocrite here

819
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But see, that's the thing

820
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
There's quite a bit of difference between what you're discussing and what's going on

821
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
This is just

822
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Well, at the same time, CNN would never run a story either

823
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
On the fact that this other game comes out and offends gay people

824
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
That would never happen, never happen

825
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Because it's stereotypes that a lot of people think about

826
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Well, going back to the massive double standard

827
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
About what's considered bigotry and what's not, really

828
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You know, it's like I was just saying in the chat room

829
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You know, racism is racism

830
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It doesn't matter

831
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Like, I brought up an example

832
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
We did a diversity class at my work

833
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You know, any corporation does diversity classes

834
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And I brought a situation

835
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And I think I said it on the show

836
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
When I worked in Alabama at Aladdin's Castle

837
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Where this black lady and her children wanted me to change out quarters

838
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Give them, you know, make change for them

839
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
And I said, I'm sorry, I can't make change for you because you're not a customer

840
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
She just wandered in from the store across the street

841
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And not across the street, but across the aisle

842
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And she's like, you're just doing that because I'm black and love

843
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm like, no, I'm doing it because you're not a paying customer here

844
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
If you want me to make change for you, there's a street fighter machine right there

845
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And she shut up and walked away

846
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So, but you see what I mean

847
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Racism is racism

848
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Bigotry is bigotry

849
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
And as long as we perpetuate, you know, that type of thought

850
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And as long as we keep getting offended

851
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Instead of just learning to roll a little bit with the punches

852
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Give a little, take a little

853
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Then what's going to happen?

854
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, we're breeding a different kind of intolerance

855
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Don't you think?

856
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That's a reasonable answer, thank you

857
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Alright, let's go see what the Twitter had to say

858
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Every week we like to post something on OLR

859
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And obviously this is a story that's generating a lot of buzz out there in the gaming community

860
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And just, I think it's invoking a reaction that goes a lot of ways beyond gaming

861
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So I'm kind of curious to see what happens over the next couple of weeks

862
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Of course then this game will come out censored

863
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And people will forget years from now

864
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
But anyhow, the question we asked our folks on Twitter

865
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Twitter.com slash OLR

866
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Did Sony overreact by recalling LittleBigPlanet due to the controversial music in the game?

867
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Why or why not?

868
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
And here's some of the responses that we got on our Twitter

869
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Starting off with Dark Tetsuya

870
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yes, since the fix was the simplest day one patch

871
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
There wasn't that much of a need to delay the game a whole week

872
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But let's not forget, not everybody has online capability

873
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Crows says, of course they didn't overreact

874
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
This being America, everyone sues for anything

875
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Sony wants to avoid a lawsuit

876
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Point, but this was also a worldwide recall

877
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Let's not forget that

878
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And I don't know about lawsuit

879
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm not trying to prove all our listeners wrong

880
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm sorry, but I just want to say

881
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Look at this too

882
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Geekboy2424 says, yes, nobody would have noticed if they wouldn't have mentioned it

883
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
The person who heard this had to have scanned it

884
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Well, he was a beta tester, right?

885
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Not to mention that he's also probably very familiar with the Quran as well

886
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't know about you, but if someone quotes Bible versus me

887
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I don't know what the hell they're talking about

888
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, I do know, and this is just a little bit I know

889
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Because one of my co-workers is Muslim

890
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Is that their prayers are done in Arabic, if I'm correct

891
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And so you do end up learning a little bit of Arabic as you study

892
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Let me read some of these other responses

893
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Marin Marvel says, I think that it was overreacting a bit

894
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
But I can understand because of not wanting to offend people

895
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Especially in this too happy day and age

896
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Dust Stories says, wait, we have to please everyone and offend no one

897
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
We better stop the world now then

898
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Big overreaction

899
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Peter Uno says, hell no, oh fine, enough of that

900
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
To be honest, political correctness is going overboard

901
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It seems silly that nobody cared until launch

902
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Gold Anthro says, yes, with the game being awaited for so long

903
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Just to remove it for something so small seems unnecessary

904
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
DJ Tyrant says, no, it was something that needed to be removed and caught earlier

905
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Not everyone is connected to the interwebs either

906
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The SEG says, considering worldwide reactions to cartoons, absolutely not

907
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Recalls are less expensive than riots

908
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Interesting point, interesting point

909
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Decipher13 says, with people suing for less these days, Sony didn't overreact

910
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Receiving the game at work and it being recalled in the same day was odd

911
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So there you have it, some of our comments from the Twitter

912
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
At twitter.com slash OLR

913
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I'm sure this will go on for quite some time

914
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm curious to see what kind of emails we get this week

915
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I don't know, again, I think this is the type of quandary to where there's no easy answer

916
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
There's no easy solution because unfortunately there are people that will get offended

917
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And it could affect gaming's perception out there as a whole

918
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And it's just a shame, it's a shame

919
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's just, I really, my last two cents on it really

920
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Is just, I'm not looking forward to a world where no one can have any sort of free thought or opinion of their own

921
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Without someone else trying to strike them down for being wrong

922
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
My final thing is, I don't have a problem

923
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
He wants to make a comment, so do I

924
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Don't be oppressing me, woman, seriously

925
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Estrogen Brigade!

926
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Now, I don't have a problem with them fixing it for the people that want it to be fixed

927
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But I do have a problem with them fixing it for the people that don't really care

928
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Or want it to be fixed in the first place

929
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
All I gotta say is they better replace it with a damn good song because that really fit with the game

930
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
And, I don't know, make an instrumental version of it or something

931
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Perfect, perfect solution

932
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Alright, well, we'll see what happens

933
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I don't really have a final thought on this because I think I'm still developing one

934
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So, let's go back to the Dick and Fart jokes

935
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
They should totally put in Two Knock Two Knock

936
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Well, I don't know if Dick and Fart jokes were included with these

937
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
But PS3 and the PSP have received brand new firmware updates

938
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The PS3 at a whopping 2.50

939
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And PSP at, now, 5.0 firmwares

940
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Some of the brand new features included with that

941
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
The PSP version is getting the PlayStation Online Store now

942
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Which is pretty awesome

943
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Also, the PS3 version, Flash 9 support

944
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh boy, that's gonna be some good stuff

945
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That probably means that some of those Flash IRC chats work now

946
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Or what about some of those Flash emulators?

947
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Or some of the Flash emulators

948
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
That's where my mind went instantly

949
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Half the reason people bought a PSP in the beginning was to play Nintendo emulators on them

950
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And now everything kind of comes full circle

951
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, I was kind of disappointed that Flash 9 is not on the PSP

952
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Because that makes things a lot easier

953
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But no, just on the PS3

954
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And also, I guess, they're including support now for the official PS3 Bluetooth adapter

955
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Because they're now releasing a new headset that's gonna be with SOCOM and stuff

956
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You can set your system to automatically shut down after downloading stuff

957
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And then, I have to remember what else was added with the PSP

958
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Probably just some minor fixes and stuff

959
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And trying to fix it so that no one can crack it

960
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh darn, too bad that failed again

961
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
So apparently the day after it came out

962
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It was already cracked and the custom firmware 5.0 was released

963
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail

964
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So, uh, oh well

965
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Do you think somebody's gonna come up with a patch to patch the offensive music back in LittleBigPlanet?

966
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Not to go back to that story, but

967
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
You know, with people that want to keep breaking Sony, what Sony destroys

968
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I did want to mention though, there was a story that we didn't make it in there

969
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
One of the things that was included with the new PS3 firmware

970
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Is there's a recovery menu that you can access now by holding down the power button

971
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Until you hear three beeps

972
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And that'll allow you to fix bad firmware updates

973
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Say your power goes out or something like that while it's installing

974
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Or god knows something happens

975
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And a bunch of other things

976
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So you can actually help recover your system so it doesn't break

977
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Which is nice, I'm glad that they threw that in there

978
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Alright, well hey, you know, some of the things that they're also kind of reformatting on the Sony side

979
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Especially when it comes into the store and how things are being presented on the online store

980
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
It looks like companies are now starting to get their own little special stores

981
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Capcom is one of the first that we're hearing about

982
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Capcom has their own little like company version of the Playstation store

983
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
If you go to the Capcom store you can get all of Capcom stuff kind of in one little place on the Playstation Network store

984
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You get the Capcom demos, their games, their themes, it's all in one spot

985
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Now funny enough this wasn't an idea of Capcom's, it was actually Sony's

986
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Who I guess must have presented the idea to them

987
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And if you think this is going to be only in the Sony side of things

988
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Guess what, they're saying that the new Xbox experience that's coming out

989
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Means that Microsoft will be able to do something similar for their companies

990
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So it's going to be very interesting is that you almost now are going to go from one

991
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It's kind of cool in a way, in my mind I'm envisioning now that online shopping for these networks

992
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Is now going from one giant everything stop shop that the company owns

993
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Like Microsoft's Walmart or Sony's Target

994
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Is now going to be like a strip mall

995
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Where you can go into the Capcom store and go into the Konami store

996
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It's going to be interesting to see what each company has to offer

997
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's going to be very very interesting to see what this does for like company branding in the video games

998
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You know what I mean?

999
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Like what stores will people visit first?

1000
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And who puts out what product?

1001
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Because you know back in the days of the NES

1002
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I don't think a lot of people followed these things

1003
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Most people didn't even know that Konami and Ultra were really the same company

1004
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
They just would follow a particular series or whatever

1005
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But it's very interesting now that we have this very company branded atmosphere

1006
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
That these online stores are going to create

1007
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Could be interesting

1008
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Of course I could be talking a whole lot of nothing

1009
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
What ends up being really no big deal

1010
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Because it still is going to be one centralized place too I'm sure

1011
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
But who knows? We'll see when the new Xbox experience comes out

1012
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
When more of these stores launch on the Playstation side

1013
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I had to make a response to Geekboy2424 in the chat room

1014
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
What did he say?

1015
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
He disagrees with me that parents shouldn't please let their children play

1016
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Yes they should

1017
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's the parent's job

1018
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
However

1019
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Don't miss out that I have said parents need to be educated

1020
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And actually research instead of making a blanket assumption

1021
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
It doesn't mean parents should put the ban hammer down

1022
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I think Geekboy2424 is a rather younger listener of ours

1023
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Which is why I think he might get a little bit hurt

1024
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That we're saying your parents need to be watching or whatever

1025
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
But we're not saying the parents need to ban everything

1026
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The parents need to be watching

1027
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And the parents should at least know what you're doing

1028
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
As far as this show is concerned

1029
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I don't think folks of a certain age should necessarily even be listening to this show

1030
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Without the parents kind of knowing what they're listening to on the internet

1031
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I like to think we're a good influence and not a bad one

1032
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But your parents have a right to know

1033
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
This is my suggestion, this is what I used to do with my mother

1034
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
True, it was over NES games when I was much younger

1035
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
But why don't you find a review of the game

1036
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Find some video clips of the game

1037
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And then say, hey, this is the game that I want to play

1038
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Do you mind if we pick it up?

1039
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And being an adult, hopefully they should be able to make a decision

1040
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Whether or not they consider what you think okay is okay

1041
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Recognize some of your passion behind it too

1042
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Exactly

1043
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Maybe you'll get props for like, wow, our kid actually put together a whole little prosecution

1044
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Instead of just going, but I want it

1045
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Which was, I've tried that a couple times too

1046
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Yeah, me too

1047
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Then they'll say, well, you've obviously put some thought into it

1048
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Maybe I should think that maybe you're old enough to have an opinion

1049
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm sorry, kids, we've got smart kids out there

1050
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
People who definitely have an opinion shouldn't just be discounted because of their age

1051
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Right?

1052
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
That's true

1053
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So help your parents make an informed decision

1054
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
If you truly think that you should have this game, put some effort into it

1055
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Let them know why

1056
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
So my next story

1057
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah, go ahead

1058
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Sorry

1059
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
There has been a little bit of a tease now

1060
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That those who finished the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock

1061
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Get a little teaser trailer saying Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams

1062
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Is supposed to come out sometime in the future

1063
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And there's actually, I think, some video up around this

1064
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Up on Joystiq if anyone wants to take a look at it

1065
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And it's your typical teaser

1066
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I watched it just because I thought the first Bioshock was pretty graphically stunning

1067
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Just to tell you the teaser is your typical teaser video

1068
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's nothing but, you know, the one shot of the girls standing on the beach or whatever

1069
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And the one line, it's a teaser in every sense of the word

1070
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
On the Atlantic Coast

1071
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And just the fact it's coming

1072
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And it gives you that tagline, Sea of Dreams

1073
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And that's it

1074
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Yeah

1075
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's what a teaser is

1076
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
So in other words, Bioshock 2 is coming

1077
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Duh, you know what I mean?

1078
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
They needed some teasing to do that

1079
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I guess now you have a subtitle, so there you go

1080
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
When's it coming out? Soon

1081
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Soon, someday

1082
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Actually I don't think it's coming out too soon

1083
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
A few years, well maybe

1084
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
2010

1085
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Soon is a blanket term

1086
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Summer 2010, I don't know, that's a guess

1087
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I say summer 2010

1088
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I like that, we'll just use that from everything now

1089
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
What?

1090
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Summer 2010

1091
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
That's when all the games are coming out

1092
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
That's when Final Fantasy 13 is coming out, summer 2010

1093
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We'll be lucky if it comes out by that time

1094
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Alright

1095
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Release dates

1096
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Well there are other games coming out

1097
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
This week at least

1098
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Starting off, we've got

1099
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The World of Goo, which is coming to PC

1100
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Fun little casual game there

1101
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Did very well on a

1102
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I think it's on the Wii already, I'm not sure

1103
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
As part of the WiiWare

1104
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And of course, today

1105
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Rock Band 2 finally made it out on the PS3

1106
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Also the special edition bundles for PS3 and Xbox 360 are now available

1107
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The Naked Brothers Band is coming out

1108
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
With a game, a karaoke game

1109
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Playstation 2 and the Wii for that one

1110
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Hooray

1111
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Penny Racer's Party Turbo Q Speedway

1112
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Apparently that got delayed from last week

1113
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
And that's hopefully coming out this week now

1114
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Spongebob

1115
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Featuring Nicktoons and the Globs of Doom

1116
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Will be out on Playstation 2, the Wii, and on the DS

1117
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Let's see here

1118
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Back at the Barnyard, slot bucket games for the DS

1119
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
We have Midnight Club Los Angeles on Playstation 3

1120
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And the Xbox 360

1121
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Also Midnight Club LA Remix for the PSP

1122
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Midnight Club is a pretty awesome racing game

1123
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I'll play that a little bit at PAX

1124
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Pass the Pigs, coming to DS

1125
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
That's that old dice game, Pigs, if you remember that

1126
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Oh, they would land in the certain formations?

1127
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh my god, okay

1128
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah, whopping 20 bucks for that

1129
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Why would you play a dice game on a video game?

1130
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I don't know

1131
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It's a good travel game

1132
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
You can't throw pigs around in a car

1133
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
They'll get lost

1134
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Alright, fair enough

1135
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Why do people buy Uno on Xbox Live?

1136
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
I throw pigs around all the time, just letting you know

1137
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
We actually have a Dwarf Potbelly

1138
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
That we throw around on long trips at semis

1139
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Wow

1140
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Wow

1141
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Lovely Lisa on DS

1142
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Yes, it's an import doll game

1143
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Yippee

1144
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Hooray, it's like a little doll that no one knows

1145
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Wii Music is coming out finally on the Wii

1146
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I know everybody's excited about that one

1147
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I am

1148
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Why?

1149
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I liked it, I'm getting it for free anyway

1150
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
What does it matter?

1151
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
If you had to pay for it, would you?

1152
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
No

1153
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Okay, that's what I thought

1154
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm getting it for free

1155
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Are you smarter than a fifth grader?

1156
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Make the grade, coming to the DS and the Wii

1157
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Let's see here

1158
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000

A bunch of girl games with Energy Jim Rockets

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
They have Think Fast, which is a Disney trivia game

Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3 coming to the Xbox 360

1169
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Oh, I had no idea that was coming out this soon

1170
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I thought for some reason it was in January

1171
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Well, they do a really good job advertising their games

1172
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Go Konami

1173
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000

Yet another horse riding sim

God, there's a lot of crap coming out

1183
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Anything else big?

1184
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Other than that, we'll just move on

1185
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Well, yeah, just small games like Far Cry 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

1186

Because I know everybody's looking forward to that

1189
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Whoopee

1190
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I think that's all the big stuff

1191
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Taking a quick look here

1192
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Let's travel over to Japan, take a look at the Japanese release dates

1193
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
There's not a lot to speak of on the Xbox 360

1194
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
NBA Live 09 gets its Japanese localization on October 23

1195
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
That coming out from EA over in Japan

1196
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Heading on over to the PlayStation 3

1197
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I imagine they're getting the same thing, and they sure are

1198
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Also, by the way, on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3

1199
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Gundam Musou is getting a price reduction on both systems

1200
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So if you haven't checked that out yet, you can

1201
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Moving on to the Nintendo Wii in Japan

1202
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000

There you go

1207
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I guess

1208
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Also coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week

1209
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Devil Summoner, a new game in the Devil Summoner series

1210
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000

1211
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
As well as Ever17, the Out of Infinity

1212
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Although I think that might just be a price reduction

1213
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah, that's just a price reduction

1214
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Also, Hakugen no Soryou Contract to Future comes out as well

1215

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Also gets a price reduction as well as Remember 11

1218
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And Sakura Taisen 3 also goes into Sega The Best series

1219
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
So lots of price reductions this week

1220
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Price reductions this week

1221
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Didn't it get out to like 5 in the Sakura Taisen series?

1222
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't know how far they got, but it's just number 3

1223
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I think 4 came out on Dreamcast, didn't it?

1224
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
3 was out on PlayStation 2, I guess

1225
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I don't know if that was a newer version or what

1226
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Could be

1227
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,000
On the Nintendo DS, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker gets a price reduction

1228
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
As does Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 12 Revenant Wings

1229
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Both getting price reductions as well

1230
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,000
As far as new games go, you got Katsuie Death Label

1231
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
As well as Kimi no Yuusha comes out from SNK Playmore

1232
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
On the DS, as well as Soul Eater, Medusa no Inubu comes out

1233
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And Wakamama Fashion Gals Mode

1234
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Because I know you were looking forward to that

1235
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
That sounds funny

1236
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That is a first party title in Japan, so go figure

1237
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Quickly looking at the Sony PSP to see what comes out this week

1238
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Bleach Soul Carnival looks to be a big title they're getting

1239
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And I know a lot of Bamani and music game fans are very excited about this

1240
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
One of my really good friends is obsessed with DJ Max

1241
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And there's a new DJ Max game coming out this week on the Sony PSP

1242
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
From what I understand, there also is going to be a US version of this game before November

1243
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I want Soul Eater

1244
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
So there you go, what's that?

1245
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I want Soul Eater

1246
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
You want Soul Eater?

1247
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I was going to say their one small game I missed

1248
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
What's that?

1249
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Coming out a week from today

1250
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Guitar Hero World Tour

1251
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It will be coming out on everything

1252
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Well that's because it's not a Tuesday game

1253
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It's a Sunday game

1254
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
And it's going to be epic I guess

1255
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
By the way, to specify, DJ Max is the Classic Y edition

1256
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
There already is several DJ Max games on the PSP

1257
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
This is the Classic Y edition

1258
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
By the way, one other game I want to point out on the PSP this week in Japan

1259
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
From Sega, Garnet Chronicle comes out as well

1260
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
DarkSaga, take us to Europe

1261
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Here are our European releases

1262
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Well at least as far as the UK is concerned

1263
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
We have on the 21st EverQuest seeds of destruction

1264
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I just like saying destruction, that's pretty freaking awesome

1265
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
A name with destruction

1266
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Destruction of destruction?

1267
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
This should just be ultimate destruction

1268
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Destroying the destructors

1269
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Or something

1270
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
New game from OLR Studios

1271
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
On the 24th we have Dead Space

1272
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Looking forward to that

1273
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Disaster Day of Crisis

1274
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Dungeon Maker

1275
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Fable 2

1276
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Which actually my husband has to work for the midnight launch tomorrow

1277
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So I'm going to laugh

1278
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We also have Legendary on Xbox 360

1279
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Well I don't

1280
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
LittleBigPlanet is given the 24th date

1281
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Although we know that's not going to happen anymore

1282
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Exactly, but I'm just saying

1283
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Also Midnight Club Los Angeles on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1284
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
As well as Midnight Club Los Angeles remix on PSP

1285
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Star Ocean The First Departure on PSP

1286
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Not too bad, huh?

1287
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Not a bad week at all

1288
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And it's just going to get busier and busier as we get closer to the holiday

1289
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Well that one last game that I had mentioned

1290
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Guitar Hero World Tour

1291
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Is very similar to another game series, Rock Band

1292
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And Rock Band of course is getting

1293
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You don't say

1294
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yes, I don't say

1295
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Rock Band is getting a brand new download pack as it does every week

1296
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And this time it's Nirvana

1297
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You get 7 songs from Nirvana

1298
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Including Breed, Lounge Act, On a Plane

1299
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Polly, Something in the Way, Stay Away, and Territorial Pissings

1300
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
And each of those is available for $2

1301
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Or you can save $3, buy the whole pack

1302
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
For $11 or $880

1303
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
But isn't it interesting that it's completely missing

1304
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Like the biggest songs on that album

1305
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are

1306
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think was on that album too

1307
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Isn't that strange?

1308
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Yeah it is a little strange except

1309
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I think Smells Like Teen Spirit is in

1310
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Guitar Hero World Tour

1311
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I'm not sure about the rest of them

1312
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah but it's not like games haven't shared the same songs before

1313
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Well they may have exclusive rights to that song

1314
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Money talks

1315
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I guess

1316
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Alright well hey if you have opted for Guitar Hero World Tour

1317
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
One of the things you can look forward to downloading next year

1318
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
That's right they're announcing download stuff for next year

1319
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
On the Guitar Hero side

1320
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The brand new Oasis album Dig Out Your Soul

1321
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I had no idea that Oasis was still putting out music

1322
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I haven't heard much of their stuff

1323
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
There's probably some British folks over on the other side of the pond

1324
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That are like bonk to me

1325
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But they don't play them on the radio at all here anymore

1326
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Not since Wonderwall back in the mid 90's

1327
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But they are still cranking out music

1328
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
They have a new album coming out Dig Out Your Soul

1329
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
And that will be coming out next year

1330
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Some of the singles from that album

1331
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Bag It Up, Waiting For The Rapture, The Shock Of The Lightning

1332
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Are all coming out on Guitar Hero World Tour

1333
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So if you are an Oasis fan

1334
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
And you're mad at me for my comment of not hearing them lately

1335
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
You at least have that to look forward to

1336
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
There you go

1337
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Well

1338
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Here's some more rumors

1339
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Hey wait a minute, you're the resident Blur fangirl

1340
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
We haven't heard a lot of Blur

1341
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Like, I love Blur talk on the show lately

1342
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Didn't Blur and Oasis have like a feud thing years ago?

1343
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Did they ever get over that?

1344
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I think that, well since Blur is basically disbanded

1345
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Because Graham Coxon got really offended when they told him

1346
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
STOP DRINKING

1347
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And he's like, well screw you guys

1348
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
You throw me out of the band, I'm never coming back

1349
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You knew that was the story right?

1350
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Did he call them all bloody wankers?

1351
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Because if he did, that's too good

1352
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Probably things a lot worse than calling someone wanker

1353
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
However

1354
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Graham Coxon has gone off to do his own thing

1355
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Damon has Gorillaz and also has The Good, The Bad, and The Queen

1356
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Which is pretty freaking good

1357
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Well I was thinking maybe if Guitar Hero is getting Oasis

1358
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
This might mean Blur for Rock Band

1359
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
If that whole little feud is totally on

1360
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I would totally love it if we had Blur for Rock Band

1361
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You know, we need to do a list list just for me

1362
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Of what Blur songs do we want to hear in Rock Band

1363
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We'll put that on the list of things to do

1364
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I'm sorry, we can move on now with news

1365
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Speaking of music games, there's a trailer

1366
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
A trailer that doesn't really have much to do with anything as far as I'm concerned

1367
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But it's the Guitar Hero Metallica trailer

1368
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Obviously taken with a shaky webcam or phone cam

1369
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Or, you know, has no gameplay shown, no nothing like that

1370
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And those look good, Rob

1371
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
What I'm eating, by the way

1372
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Orin Sam's Foodio for a minute

1373
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I found these when I was in the Bay Area this weekend

1374
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And I about crapped myself

1375
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I was so excited

1376
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
They're flat fortune cookies

1377
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
So they're fortune cookies, but they're just ironed out flat

1378
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And without the fortune, obviously, in them

1379
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But I love the taste of fortune cookies

1380
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And I know there's probably some of our listeners going

1381
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Big fucking deal

1382
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
But you can't get these here, anywhere

1383
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I've looked

1384
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
In the factory in the Bay Area to find them

1385
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Or Long's Drugs, apparently

1386
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Go figure

1387
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Sorry, random thought

1388
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I was just looking at the golden shiny goodness

1389
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Would you like one?

1390
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I would love one now

1391
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Here you go, I'm bringing it over

1392
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's like a pancake, it looks like a freaking pancake

1393
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Hold up to the camera

1394
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Those of you that are watching on Justin TV, I'll give you a cookie too

1395
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
While Jamie reads the story

1396
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Anyway, there is a very shaky teaser trailer

1397
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Up for Guitar Hero Metallica

1398
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Which I had been hearing

1399
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Them speak of before

1400
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
So I don't think it's that far off

1401
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But it's saying

1402
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The trailer is supposed to come with Guitar Hero World Tour

1403
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And it has

1404
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
A Ride the Lightning

1405
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
You know, 2009

1406
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Something, so

1407
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Cause that's not cheesy or anything

1408
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I think Metallica has finally

1409
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Gotten off of their music

1410
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And electronic distribution

1411
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
And just said, cool

1412
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Though they still have to do that

1413
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
To be edgy, you know, but

1414
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
They're going, so

1415
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And I do also have to say that the Metallica tracks

1416
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
In Rock Band 2 are fucking hard

1417
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Maybe they just like playing Rock Band

1418
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
In Guitar Hero

1419
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
So they decide, you know, when Guitar Hero comes and says

1420
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Hey, we'll do a whole freaking

1421
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Game about you guys

1422
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And they're like, cool

1423
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Or they saw what they did with Aerosmith and were like, we want that shit

1424
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Well, and Metallica

1425
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Is the epitome of awesome

1426
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Rock before they sold out

1427
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
So

1428
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Well, I hope

1429
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
For their sake that they learn

1430
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
They learn from Guitar Hero

1431
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Or not Guitar Hero

1432
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
They learn from Rock Band and decide to

1433
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Go ahead and allow each of those

1434
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Games that they release separately

1435
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
To be able to be downloaded

1436
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So that you can play tracks

1437
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
In your Guitar Hero World Tour game

1438
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Cause that would suck otherwise

1439
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Especially if there's

1440
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
A lot of games coming out like they were saying that they were gonna do

1441
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I don't know

1442
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Oh well

1443
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Well, something completely un-Guitar Hero related

1444
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
South Peak

1445
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Has now bought the small independent

1446
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Game publishing company

1447
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Gamecock

1448
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Who apparently acts

1449
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I don't know, they act crazy

1450
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
But they do release a lot of

1451
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Like a cock?

1452
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Yes, crazy like the cock

1453
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Apparently though, they release a lot of independent

1454
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Games of course like

1455
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I think actually

1456
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
This week, I can't believe I forgot it

1457
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Legendary

1458
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Should be coming out

1459
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And that's one game that they're publishing as well as

1460
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Velvet Assassin that's gonna be coming out later on

1461
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I'm sorry, but they did that Pirates and Ninjas

1462
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Dodgeball game that was horrible

1463
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
No, that's South Peak, yeah

1464
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
South Peak did, I'm talking about Gamecock

1465
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I thought Gamecock did that game

1466
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
No

1467
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I don't think they did

1468
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
They're publishing it, whatever

1469
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
They don't make the games, they just publish them

1470
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yes

1471
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
The Pirates and Ninjas Dodgeball

1472
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Maybe not exactly the glowing

1473
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Example of their portfolio

1474
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Legendary looked good

1475
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And Mushroom

1476
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Sort of okay, but there's

1477
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
A lot more games they're putting out

1478
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And they're increasingly getting better

1479
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So that's nice

1480
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
South Peak on the other hand, they've been releasing

1481
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Overlord

1482
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
That's pretty cool

1483
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Overlord is pretty sweet

1484
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
They had some other stuff, X-Planes

1485
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I think that was one of theirs as well

1486
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I wonder if Bang Mini

1487
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
One of the first orders of business at South Peak

1488
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Is gonna be telling the guys at Gamecock to sit down

1489
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And shut up, cause you know, they're kinda

1490
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Known for just making a lot of noise, you know what I mean

1491
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
They just make noise, and some people don't

1492
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Get it, like sometimes you kinda look at them and go

1493
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
They're just kinda weird and need to shut up

1494
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I don't think that they're like

1495
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I get the sense Gamecock kinda runs

1496
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Themselves like a fraternity

1497
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And for real, I get the sense

1498
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That they have raging kegger parties at some of their

1499
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Company things, events, right

1500
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that

1501
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
It seems like this giant gaming fraternity

1502
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And I'm sure it's a fun as hell place to work

1503
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
But sometimes you look at that and go

1504
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Okay, they have to remember

1505
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
That in every good frat party movie

1506
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
That there's always a

1507
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Montage sequence where they have to pull it

1508
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Together and act a little bit less

1509
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Like a fraternity and more like

1510
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
A brotherhood and actually come together and do business

1511
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Instead of just fuck around all the time

1512
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And they haven't really gotten to that point

1513
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
In the grand scheme of things

1514
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Gameguru in chat wants to say

1515
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
South Peak didn't have anything to do with

1516
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball, Gamecock published it though

1517
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I thought I saw their logo on that game

1518
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And I'm sorry

1519
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
We talked about this, I think

1520
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Last week or two weeks ago when Dark Star Wars

1521
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Classic Game of the Week was the dodgeball game for Neo Geo

1522
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That I thought

1523
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
The Pirates vs Ninja game was kind of assy

1524
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Compared to Neo Geo

1525
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I thought it was a dumb idea to begin with

1526
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Oh, Pirates vs Ninjas, we're gonna settle this match

1527
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Once and for all with Dodgeball

1528
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
And I'm like, lame

1529
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Tune out

1530
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says if Gamecock has

1531
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Kager parties, then OLR has pie parties

1532
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Not true, tonight is a flat fortune cookie party

1533
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Pancake cookie

1534
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And they taste like pancakes too

1535
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
They're delish

1536
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
They taste like yummy

1537
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Awesometasticness

1538
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Also pretty awesometastic

1539
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Is the game Soul Calibur 4

1540
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
But what is less awesome

1541
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Is that we all saw this coming a mile away

1542
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
They swore up and down

1543
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Oh yeah, Darth Vader, Yoda, exclusive

1544
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
To their respective consoles

1545
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Even though there's that big gap in the character

1546
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
List select screen

1547
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And there was video and screenshots of them playing

1548
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
No, it's totally exclusive

1549
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Well, sure enough, they've confirmed this week

1550
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
That due to

1551
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Overwhelming fan response

1552
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Mhm

1553
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
That soon you will be able to download

1554
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Darth Vader and Yoda

1555
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
In Xbox 360 and Playstation

1556
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Three, you know, the respective versions

1557
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That are missing it

1558
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
You'll be able to download them on October 23rd

1559
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I'm not sure if that's a US or a Japanese date

1560
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
But you know it's gonna happen everywhere

1561
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I mean, come on

1562
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
October 23rd, you know that's almost exactly three months

1563
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
From the game's release

1564
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
What a coinkydink

1565
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You've had an exclusive deal for

1566
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Three months

1567
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
It'll set you back $5

1568
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
That's 400 Microsoft points

1569
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Or in Sony terms, $5

1570
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I'm sorry, in Sony terms, $4.99

1571
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So you have

1572
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Because Sony's not gonna like

1573
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Do anything with that extra penny

1574
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yes, isn't that wonderful

1575
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You have to put full amounts

1576
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Full dollars into your account

1577
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
But they charge you $4.99

1578
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So there's always a remainder

1579
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Oh, cry

1580
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You know, I'm a consumer whore

1581
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'll probably get it anyway

1582
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Just charge even amounts, god, who cares

1583
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
$4.99 may seem cheaper

1584
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
But seriously, people know how to do math

1585
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
They understand it's only one cent cheaper

1586
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I'm glad though

1587
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I can say I told you so, I told you so

1588
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
To my friend that said I have to get the Playstation 3

1589
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Version of Soul Calibur because it's the only way I'll get to play

1590
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Vader, and secretly I think

1591
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
He just wanted to play me online

1592
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
And I'm like, just wait

1593
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
There will be download content

1594
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's inevitable, and I'll bet you what

1595
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
You know what, I bet you money

1596
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I will bet you money, significant amount of money

1597
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
This is not download content

1598
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
It's pay to unlock content

1599
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Money

1600
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I posted a picture in the chatroom, by the way

1601
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Of the view from where I sit

1602
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Well, thank you for that

1603
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It's of Rob's head

1604
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Oh, great

1605
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And one of your pancake cookies

1606
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Speaking of yummy

1607
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Resistance 2

1608
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Kids like aliens

1609
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Kids should not be playing the game

1610
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Because it is mature

1611
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Oh

1612
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
The beta

1613
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
For Resistance 2

1614
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Began on Friday

1615
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So

1616
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
For those who got in, let us know how it is

1617
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You know what you can tell us

1618
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Some opinion here or there

1619
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
It's going to be

1620
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Going from

1621
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Actually

1622
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
The 20th of October

1623
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
So I guess actually that's

1624
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I'm sorry, that's in Europe

1625
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
It's starting on Monday the 20th

1626
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And it's going to be going on until Thursday

1627
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
The 13th of November

1628
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And there will be keys that are given out

1629
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
From IGN, but there's no date

1630
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
As to when those keys will be given out

1631
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So keep your eyes on IGN for

1632
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
A little bit more on that

1633
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I like how the beta is going longer than actually the game

1634
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
The game is coming out in the middle of the beta

1635
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
That's the UK

1636
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Dates

1637
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Loki, you try to get into betas that you probably don't belong in

1638
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Are you going to get into this one?

1639
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I'm not even going to try

1640
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I didn't really play much

1641
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Actually, I didn't play any of the multiplayer

1642
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
In Resistance 1

1643
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
In fact, I sold my copy back

1644
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Yesterday

1645
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
But you still enjoy the game, right?

1646
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Yeah, the game was awesome

1647
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And I will plan on getting it

1648
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'll enjoy the game

1649
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I'll have to wait a few weeks

1650
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
There you go

1651
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
But, yeah

1652
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I don't know

1653
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
The last few multiplayer betas I've been in

1654
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Call of Duty 4 didn't really play much

1655
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
What else did I get in?

1656
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Battlefield Bad Company

1657
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I didn't even play that at all

1658
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm a horrible beta tester

1659
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
For what it's worth, I played the Wrath of the Lich King beta once

1660
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I went through all that patching and all that crap to play it once

1661
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And that was it

1662
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Doesn't that mean you don't have to patch it later?

1663
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
No, it was a completely separate thing

1664
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
No, because you still have to buy the retail copy of it

1665
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And you know, they're going to change some things

1666
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
From what was in the beta

1667
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Well, it's finally here

1668
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
For those people clamoring to play

1669
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
A translation of Mother 3

1670
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You can now download the patch

1671
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
For your ROM

1672
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
That you may have of Mother 3

1673
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Of course you would

1674
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Need to have an import copy of the game

1675
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Because, you know

1676
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
To make it legit

1677
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
You can now download the patch

1678
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
The update, which has been worked on

1679
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
For a while now

1680
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Is finally available

1681
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So that's pretty awesome now that you get to play

1682
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Mother 3, which, I don't know

1683
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I don't know why they don't just translate it

1684
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Seriously, why do they refuse

1685
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
To put that game out over here?

1686
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I mean, it is literally

1687
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
A refusal on Nintendo's part

1688
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
To just put that game out here

1689
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And remember how

1690
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
How long it

1691
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
You know, the fans put effort into

1692
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Doing second to three and we never got it

1693
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So

1694
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
It's just weird how adamant they are

1695
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I mean, I can't imagine it costs that much money

1696
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
To translate, but maybe it's because then they have to

1697
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Produce the game, I don't know, it's just

1698
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
It's just sad

1699
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And you look at some of the stuff that is coming out from Nintendo

1700
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
On these systems and you just go, why?

1701
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Personal training cooking

1702
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
That is awesome

1703
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Not only are they

1704
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Little behind in putting that out

1705
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Because there's going to be about four or five

1706
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Other cooking games coming out around the same time

1707
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I don't think anyone's going to buy it

1708
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I mean

1709
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I'm sure there's people out there that actually

1710
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Purchase every single Nintendo game that comes out

1711
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
But, dude, seriously, you might start

1712
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Questioning that

1713
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Alright, one more story before we get to the classic

1714
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Game of the week and get to our break tonight

1715
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Hey ladies

1716
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
If you're still looking for a Halloween costume

1717
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You know your gamer man

1718
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
In your life might enjoy the sexy

1719
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Lingerie

1720
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
With Ms. Pac-Man's likeness on it

1721
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It will look like that

1722
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are eating your boobies

1723
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Because that's what this bra looks like

1724
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Is that you actually have

1725
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man

1726
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Just click on the show roll link

1727
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
And you can get this picture

1728
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
But it looks, I mean, they're sexy little outfits

1729
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I get that

1730
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
And I like how when the model

1731
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I don't know what you want to call it

1732
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Gladiator style skirt with little flaps

1733
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And if you lift up the flaps

1734
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It reveals Inky

1735
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
One of the ghosts, or maybe it's Binky or Pinky

1736
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I don't know, but on your panties

1737
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Right where your cooter is

1738
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
So, nice little surprise there

1739
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Like, ooh, ghost

1740
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And I would like to point out

1741
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
That the ghost is blue

1742
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Which means it is an appropriate time

1743
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
To munch it

1744
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
For 200 points

1745
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Anyway

1746
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
3wishes.com is where you can

1747
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Buy Ms. Video Game

1748
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Hey, while you're at it

1749
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You can also pick up their Chun-Li outfit if you'd like to

1750
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I think I shall be

1751
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Clicking on a linky

1752
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Are you going to be buying

1753
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Ms. Video Game for Dan this Halloween?

1754
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Not for Dan to wear, but for

1755
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
No, I'll just be buying it for myself, it's freaking cool

1756
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
There you have it

1757
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
And no, listeners, you cannot

1758
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
HasPix

1759
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
No, you cannot

1760
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Not just a no, but a hell fuck no

1761
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Alright

1762
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Hell fuck yes, though, to the classic game of the week

1763
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Right, DarkSakura?

1764
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Hell fuck yes, let's check it out

1765
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
We're going to travel gaming's history

1766
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
To find a game that DarkSakura

1767
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Thinks you all should be playing

1768
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It's the classic game of the week

1769
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And I think this week's classic game of the week

1770
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Is probably one a lot of people have

1771
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Played, I'm guessing

1772
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
If they haven't, they suck

1773
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Or maybe we're too young

1774
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
To see it the first time

1775
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
But you need to go find this game

1776
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Right, DarkSakura?

1777
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
We can get it on PSP, shit

1778
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Alright, well, tell us about it

1779
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
What is this week's classic game of the week?

1780
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
We have two games, but they're together, one's a sequel

1781
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It's Parappa the Rapper

1782
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
And Parappa the Rapper 2

1783
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Parappa

1784
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
How do you not know this song?

1785
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Seriously, the demo came with what?

1786
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I think it was on one of the old Sony magazines

1787
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
It was, and I played the fuck out of it?

1788
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Anyway

1789
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
You basically play

1790
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
It's all done in sort of a 2D flat style

1791
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
For all the characters

1792
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
And you play as a little dog named Parappa

1793
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Who has to believe, because I gotta believe

1794
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And basically

1795
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
He goes around rapping

1796
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Against different people

1797
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So it's really a music rhythm game

1798
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
It's like Simon Says, really

1799
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Where they, the words that

1800
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Whichever the masters that you're going against

1801
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Their words have a pattern of button presses

1802
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
And then you have to repeat it for yours

1803
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Or do something that corresponds

1804
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
That's actually more Parappa 2

1805
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
And of course the better you do

1806
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
The better your score

1807
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
If you start sucking, then

1808
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
You go to bad, you're not rapping cool

1809
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
If you get from

1810
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Rapping good to rapping cool

1811
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Then the stage just completely goes off

1812
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
And you take over and you just have to keep pressing buttons

1813
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Randomly until the stage is over

1814
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Which was actually the only way I passed the stage

1815
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
From Jeremy Lammy, which we'll get to later

1816
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So

1817
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
The game was made by

1818
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Masaya Matsura

1819
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Who was

1820
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Actually

1821
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
One of the, the leader of the Hyperpop unit

1822
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
For

1823
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
But he was also, the company

1824
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
That brought out the game was Nana Oncha

1825
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
So

1826
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If anyone remembers

1827
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Nana Nana Nana Nana Oncha

1828
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I played this game literally a million times

1829
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
And Unchan Malami

1830
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I love these games

1831
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You have the meter like I was saying before

1832
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You have the rapping good

1833
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's when you're doing okay

1834
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
When you're doing as you're expected to

1835
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
If you're rapping bad, the music gets a little worse

1836
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
If you're rapping awful, it's just

1837
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Depressing sounding

1838
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And the stage is rain

1839
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And it gets awful

1840
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
And the better you do, it starts going back to normal again

1841
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You know, like you'll have this little

1842
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Minor, you know, chord

1843
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Baseline to it

1844
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
So

1845
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
The art was done by Rodney Greenblatt

1846
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And um

1847
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
He's got a website that's just got

1848
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Tons of his art

1849
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
But it also did have a sequel

1850
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Which we're getting to the music of next time

1851
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And we will hear the music from the sequel right now

1852
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Well this is just the start of it

1853
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
This is from Parappa 2

1854
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I didn't put Unchan Malami in here

1855
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
While even though it plays the same

1856
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
It feels differently, I think, don't you agree?

1857
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Yeah, I mean it is a different game

1858
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
It's like um

1859
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It's not a sequel but an equal, if that makes sense

1860
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah, and um

1861
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Unchan Malami and friends make an appearance in this game

1862
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But I had to pick the best music in

1863
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Parappa 2

1864
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I think we get a cut scene with this one

1865
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I don't know if it goes straight into the song

1866
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Hey everybody, watch out for those flying noodles

1867
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Cause if you don't do well here

1868
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
All you get to eat are noodles

1869
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And here we go

1870
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So you can find Sister Mustachio

1871
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
I will

1872
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But anyway, the reason why I had to put Parappa 2 up on there

1873
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Is because the music is just

1874
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
A lot better

1875
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Different styles

1876
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I really love the Parappa 2 soundtrack

1877
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
And um

1878
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
But I had to pick that particular level

1879
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Cause there's one stage where Parappa has to trap himself

1880
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
In a video game or else everybody in the universe has to eat noodles forever

1881
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And that's

1882
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
As far as I'll say without spoiling the rest of the story of the game

1883
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
If you haven't played it

1884
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
God knows why you haven't

1885
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But um

1886
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It also really goes there

1887
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
A lot more stylistically

1888
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
As far as having stages

1889
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Where you change perspective

1890
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Within your 3D environment

1891
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Like the

1892
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Ant guru

1893
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Or um

1894
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
You know where you uh

1895
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
That's the first Parappa

1896
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Oh I thought you wanted this movie show

1897
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
The one from Parappa 2

1898
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
What stage number was it?

1899
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
4 I think

1900
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Well this is one of my favorite songs from Parappa

1901
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:58,000
When I say boom boom boom

1902
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
You say bam bam bam boom

1903
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
When I say boom boom boom

1904
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I love this song

1905
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
If you sort of freestyle a little bit with it

1906
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It increases your score

1907
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And if it's good enough

1908
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That shoots you into cool mode

1909
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Pretty much

1910
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
You know so

1911
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Now going back to this I mentioned it before

1912
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Is um

1913
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
That there is a PSP version

1914
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And I happen to look into my copy for about 13 bucks

1915
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
When a Hollywood video

1916
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Is going out of business

1917
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Um

1918
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But uh

1919
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
It's the same thing

1920
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
You've got lots of different versus modes in it

1921
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Um jammerlami

1922
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
We will definitely be

1923
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Yeah here's another one

1924
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And who can forget the bathroom rap in the first game?

1925
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
God I know

1926
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Um especially as often as it's been quoted

1927
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Um

1928
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
But this is why I think that um

1929
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Parappa 2 though

1930
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
If you can just listen to the difference between

1931
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
How much more complex the music is

1932
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
I really like it a lot better personally

1933
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Um

1934
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Jammerlami was another

1935
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Game that's in the same vein

1936
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
And I was saying I'll probably cover it

1937
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
On another one because it honestly is

1938
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
I think different enough

1939
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Within the style of music that it can qualify

1940
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
As a different game

1941
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
But there was Parappa mode in it

1942
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And Parappa mode was pretty freaking cool

1943
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Because it turned all these rocking songs into rap

1944
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Um

1945
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
There are some differences

1946
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Um

1947
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
A few lines that were changed

1948
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
As far as

1949
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
You know one released to the other

1950
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Um

1951
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
There was an anime

1952
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
A Parappa anime that I thought was really really cute

1953
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Um it came out

1954
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
In Japan it actually has a really cool little intro song to it too

1955
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Um

1956
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
But for anyone

1957
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
When I was speaking about the uh

1958
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Um

1959
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
I was talking to a guy named Rodney Greenblatt

1960
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
His uh website

1961
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Is um

1962
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Wednesdayload.com

1963
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
W-H-I-M-S-Y

1964
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Load L-O-A-D dot com

1965
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
That's all one word dot com

1966
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Um and

1967
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
While his artwork may seem fairly simplistic

1968
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
He's got some really nice and complex stuff on there

1969
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Uh some uh

1970
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Uh sculpture

1971
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Um different uh

1972
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
You know medium he uses

1973
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Work you know

1974
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Given you know my recent educational career

1975
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I know all the lyrics to these today

1976
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I remember driving around San Francisco one time after

1977
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Picking up somebody and um

1978
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
He had brought the CD and we listened to it

1979
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
In the Rain or in the Snow

1980
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Um

1981
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
We've often referred to as um

1982
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
The After Effects of certain

1983
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Eating at Gem Boys as

1984
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
The Funky Flow

1985
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Nice

1986
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Um really not joking

1987
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
But um

1988
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
That's their game

1989
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Parappa and Parappa 2

1990
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
There you go here classic game of the week

1991
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Parappa the Rappa and it's sequel Parappa the Rappa 2

1992
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Two for the price of one

1993
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I couldn't mention one without mentioning the other

1994
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Right it's like a necessity

1995
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Personally I like the second

1996
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Parappa better

1997
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
As a game and music wise

1998
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
But you cannot mention the second

1999
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
One without mentioning the one that started

2000
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
At all right you know

2001
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
You sure cannot alright there you have it

2002
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Your classic game of the week and that means it's break

2003
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Time folks and when we come back we haven't even

2004
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Really touched a lot of the Microsoft news going on in the world

2005
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Microsoft might be giving out

2006
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Some free memory cards

2007
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Soon so we're going to be talking about that when we come back

2008
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
From this break and some other stuff

2009
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Including that story I referenced a little bit earlier

2010
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
About something in a game that pisses me off a little bit

2011
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
And this is something

2012
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
We actually found ourselves

2013
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Here at Orange Lounge Radio you will not have read about

2014
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
This on any blogs yet

2015
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Kind of some I guess you could say exclusive news

2016
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
But I don't like using that term it's just kind of one of those

2017
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
You may not have heard of this yet

2018
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
We'll be talking about it in part B when we come back

2019
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:28,000
After this break

2020
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2021
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Hail to the king baby

2022
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Hey welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio

2023
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
And thanks J-Rod for that new little commercial there

2024
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I love it when other people do the commercials for us

2025
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
If you have a promo you want to run for your

2026
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Nonprofit website or if you have a

2027
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Podcast you want to plug that's independent

2028
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
You can always send us a commercial

2029
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Or if you just want to do something cool for Orange Lounge Radio

2030
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Like J-Rod did

2031
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
You can put that together and send it to us

2032
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
At Orange Lounge Radio there's more information available on the forums

2033
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Meanwhile we're coming back to our show

2034
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
After a pretty fun first half

2035
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Which I must say for this show

2036
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Was surprisingly intelligent

2037
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Considering we were talking about the Quran

2038
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And the controversy around the little big planet

2039
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And all that

2040
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I think we're pretty smart

2041
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So this is the Oscar clip

2042
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Tonight's episode

2043
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Episode number 299

2044
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
It's going to be a big show next week

2045
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Hey that fart over there must be

2046
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Mean that Fart Princess

2047
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Is joining us here in studio

2048
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Who just surprised us

2049
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
By joining us during the break I had no idea you were coming tonight

2050
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Hi Fart Princess how are you?

2051
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Hi I was just supplementing the Oscar material

2052
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Oh thank you

2053
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
And by the way she's no longer Rice Princess

2054
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
She's Fart Princess

2055
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
You're a liar

2056
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And also joining us tonight

2057
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I haven't seen you in a long time

2058
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Now what are we calling you these days?

2059
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It used to be Casper the Gay

2060
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But I now go by The Doctor

2061
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Now The Doctor

2062
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I've got a Sonic Screwdriver right here

2063
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Oh and our guests are extremely loud tonight

2064
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm very sorry

2065
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I left mine at home

2066
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
I'll adjust the volume

2067
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
As we move in

2068
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
We actually have a listener called The Doctor too

2069
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
And now there's going to be some confusion

2070
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Let me see your Sonic Screwdriver

2071
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
You've got the little one?

2072
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It's not Sonic then

2073
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
No but after the show

2074
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I'm going to play with Captain Jack's Sonic Screwdriver

2075
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Oh my

2076
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Oh my

2077
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You know that's actually what I was planning on doing for Halloween

2078
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Is getting a blue suit

2079
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
And tie and wearing my con verses

2080
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And going as Chick Doctor

2081
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Oh my god that'd be so awesome and then we would match

2082
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Because I'm going to be Doctor Who as well

2083
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I've got the black ones

2084
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I was actually either going to do the blue suit

2085
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Or do a different color suit and be Chick Doctor

2086
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That'd be so awesome

2087
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
It's nice to have guests in the studio it's been a long time

2088
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Especially considering episode 300 of this program

2089
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
If you can believe it is next week

2090
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Oh my

2091
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Yeah episode 300 is next week

2092
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Oh my

2093
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And we're doing nothing special for it except soliciting congratulations

2094
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
And whatever memories from our listeners

2095
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
On 877 Game OLR when we're not live

2096
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
You should do something special

2097
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
We might do some games next week

2098
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
So you kids should come back

2099
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So there you have it

2100
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
This is some gaming news if you guys want to comment on the news

2101
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You have a microphone feel free to comment

2102
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Just refrain from fart noises fart princess

2103
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Do we need more fart noises?

2104
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Alright

2105
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I love that I come back from break

2106
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
And talk about what an intelligence show we're having tonight

2107
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
And then fart princess shows up

2108
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
To fuck the whole thing up

2109
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
What are you talking about?

2110
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
What?

2111
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
What?

2112
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
What?

2113
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
What?

2114
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
We have to go from extremes

2115
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
We have to keep the listeners guessing

2116
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
And Rob?

2117
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
There's the show I was missing somehow

2118
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And Rob?

2119
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yeah great

2120
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Oh how much lower can we go? Yes

2121
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Did you ever see that skit on the state where they had the high brow side

2122
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
And the low brow side

2123
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Shifting over to the low brow side

2124
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I think I vaguely remember yes

2125
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
The state was a cool show

2126
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I had the guy who had to put his balls and stuff

2127
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Can we get back to the news please?

2128
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
No we're supposed to make the show crappy now

2129
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Loki some gaming news for the love of god

2130
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
So yes

2131
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
There is this rumor

2132
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Going around that the next

2133
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Xbox system

2134
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Will be forwards compatible

2135
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Yeah I know you've heard

2136
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
All about backwards compatibility

2137
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Oh but we got the brand new forwards

2138
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Compatibility

2139
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
It will play the games of the future

2140
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
No really what it means is it will

2141
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
And I think this technology is already available now

2142
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
It will make your Xbox

2143
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
360 games better

2144
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Same you know either at a higher

2145
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Resolution or

2146
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Make them play smoother

2147
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I don't know like the Playstation

2148
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Isn't that the exact same fucking thing

2149
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
The 360 was supposed to do to original

2150
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Xbox games? And it does to a certain

2151
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Extent it does you know

2152
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Smooth out the graphics a little bit

2153
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And it also

2154
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
You know kind of up rezzes it

2155
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
A little bit same with the Playstation 2

2156
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
It kind of made it a little bit smoother

2157
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Decreased loading times

2158
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Depending on which option you chose

2159
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So how is this any different

2160
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Than backwards compatibility? In fact I would say

2161
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It's exactly the same as backwards compatibility

2162
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Just with a different name to it

2163
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Because obviously your Xbox 360 is not going to be able to play

2164
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
New games

2165
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I don't know I'll tell you the last system that had

2166
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
True forwards compatibility was the Dreamcast

2167
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And I'll tell you why

2168
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Because with every new game

2169
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
They would load a new version of Windows CE

2170
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
That would have an improved running environment

2171
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
For each game that came out subsequent

2172
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So in that respect

2173
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
That's forward compatibility

2174
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
We haven't had a system do that since

2175
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
But it's also firmware updates

2176
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And you know they have those

2177
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Available now and you know with

2178
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Each firmware update it could make your

2179
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
System run smoother

2180
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Isn't it just a bunch of

2181
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Marketing mumbo jumbo?

2182
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It is a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo and rumor

2183
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Marketing mumbo jumbo might I add

2184
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So who cares

2185
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
The system isn't going to be out for a while

2186
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Anyways and we'll listen to all the marketing

2187
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Mumbo jumbo when that actually happens

2188
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Moral of the story?

2189
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Sega is awesome

2190
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I'm not sure how we got to that but okay

2191
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Dreamcast

2192
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Let's read some comments from chat

2193
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Our first half of the show tonight was missing

2194
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Too much of the chat room. Let's get some comments from chat

2195
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Make up for it part B here

2196
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Redertainment says forwards compatibility sounds like

2197
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
New things can be promoted and such

2198
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Backwards compatibility sounds old and dated

2199
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
So like with forwards compatibility

2200
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Yoda and Vader will already be unlocked

2201
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Is that what it is?

2202
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Maybe?

2203
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
You don't even know what the hell I'm talking about

2204
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I'm sorry we're like acting right now

2205
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Alright

2206
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
By the way if you're not watching Justin TV

2207
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
All rice princess and the doctor

2208
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Are doing are beating each other up on cam

2209
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
For your entertainment so check that out

2210
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
That's all we're doing

2211
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Hey I want to talk about a little bit of news

2212
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
And actually this might be something you guys might have an opinion on

2213
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
I don't know and this is not out there yet

2214
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
This news is not out there yet

2215
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
This actually was my buddy Shane

2216
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You know he's been on the show here before

2217
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Plenty of times he actually works at a game store

2218
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
And he sent me a picture

2219
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
From a strategy guide coming out for Fable 2

2220
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And it's the Brady Games

2221
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Strategy guide for Fable 2

2222
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
And there's a section in it that talks about clothing

2223
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
There are plenty of quality

2224
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Tailors scattered throughout the cities of

2225
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Albion and most of them are

2226
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
I'm sorry and each of them are

2227
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Cable of crafting some fine handmade clothing

2228
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Etc, etc, etc. Let me get to this part

2229
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Many items are unisex

2230
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But those that are designed

2231
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Specifically for one sex

2232
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Carry a cross-dressing rating

2233
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Should the other sex wear them

2234
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Heroes wishing to experiment with gender

2235
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Play should consider wearing up

2236
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Clothes of the opposite gender

2237
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Especially if looking to start a same

2238
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Sex relationship

2239
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Interesting

2240
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
So that's what I can infer from this

2241
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
From the strategy guide

2242
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Is that in Fable 2

2243
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
If you want to start a same sex relationship

2244
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Because you know the game will allow you to basically

2245
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Have whatever types of relationships you want

2246
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
The way to do that is by cross-dressing

2247
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
You have to trick them

2248
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Apparently

2249
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
That's wrong

2250
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
That's crazy

2251
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
This is what I was talking about in the first half

2252
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Where even I looked at this and I went

2253
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
Okay I'm a little bit offended by this

2254
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Because we've been trying to combat

2255
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
For years and years and years

2256
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
When they splash images of the pride parade on the news

2257
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And that's what people think

2258
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
The culture is all about

2259
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Well some of us don't even like that kind of stuff

2260
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
And it's like

2261
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Nobody applies logic

2262
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
It's like you're gay and you like men

2263
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Not women

2264
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Hello

2265
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
That's like the epitome of being gay

2266
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Hello

2267
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
And maybe I'm just being a little hypersensitive about this

2268
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
And letting the trigger figure go off

2269
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Too soon on this and being offended

2270
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
But I'm just kind of like come on people

2271
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Is this really the way the game

2272
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Has to be designed is that if I want to impress

2273
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
People of the same gender I have to cross-dress

2274
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
I'm sure the designers will come back and say

2275
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Well you don't have to cross-dress

2276
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
You don't have to do it

2277
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
But I'm sure it improves your chances and to me that's wrong

2278
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Yeah no and it's just

2279
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm not mad about it

2280
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Yeah it's dumb

2281
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
That's what people think though because it's like

2282
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
This one girl in a club was like

2283
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Oh do you wear panties and I'm like

2284
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I'm not a woman

2285
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
I don't wear panties

2286
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
No that's what they make mantis for

2287
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Yeah maybe mantis

2288
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Well it's

2289
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
For all we know

2290
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
And I don't know how much further

2291
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Into the strategy guide he looked at it

2292
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It could be possible

2293
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
That maybe it's just a small

2294
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
No apparently later in the guide

2295
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Each article of clothing

2296
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Is actually has like a cross-dress rating

2297
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Okay

2298
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So cross-dressing is a facet of the game

2299
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
And I don't know if it's the guide

2300
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I don't know if it's the game

2301
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I'm assuming the guide is just reporting on how the game was designed

2302
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
You know what I mean but that sentence to me

2303
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Stings the way they say that

2304
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Is that if you want to improve your chances

2305
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
In a same-sex relationship you gotta cross-dress

2306
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Then make it sound like that's an integral part of it

2307
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Reddertainment in chat says

2308
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Can I attract people of the opposite gender while cross-dressing

2309
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Dude I know in real life

2310
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
There's a lot of women that do find that hot actually

2311
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Hell yeah

2312
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
A man who's comfortable with their sexuality

2313
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
All the teenage guys that go to cosplay dressed as like Japanese school girls

2314
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Like I'm sure there's a lot of chicks there

2315
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
That get off on that

2316
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
I almost became a cosplay stalker

2317
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Because of this one guy dressed as Utena

2318
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
There you go

2319
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
And he looked freaking gorgeous

2320
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I was like I'm gonna follow you now

2321
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
Oh my

2322
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
AcidicVampire in chat says

2323
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
At least you can have a same-sex relationship in The Sims

2324
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Exactly I think The Sims is a game that does it right

2325
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
The game is not about

2326
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Same-sex relationships

2327
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
The game does not force you to do same-sex relationships

2328
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's just there

2329
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Just like in real life

2330
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Or like in Bully

2331
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
In Bully you have to dress up a little bit

2332
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
You have to wear your aqua-weary vest to get a kiss from a guy

2333
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
But that's not too bad

2334
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Well at that point it was just like

2335
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
We'll take what we can get

2336
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Sauce brought up Manfay

2337
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
And she can

2338
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
She can put Manfay right away

2339
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Nobody is attracted to Manfay

2340
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Okay that's

2341
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
You don't want to know

2342
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
The doctor just asked what is Manfay

2343
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Did you watch Cowboy Bebop?

2344
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
No he doesn't

2345
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Don't even bring up the picture please

2346
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Rob do it

2347
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
We need a reaction shot

2348
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
This is radio

2349
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Can you describe what Manfay is while I pull up the picture in chat here

2350
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
The character Fay in Cowboy Bebop

2351
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Has been cosplay

2352
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Yes a woman

2353
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Has been cosplayed

2354
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
By many pretty women

2355
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
And one hairy man

2356
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
That is Manfay

2357
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Rob share the picture in the chat room please

2358
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Sailor Bubba is a close second

2359
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Oh yeah, oh god

2360
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Shut her

2361
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
There you have it

2362
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I've been at conventions

2363
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Where Manfay has been present

2364
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And see look look

2365
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Manfay we're all sitting here and laughing at

2366
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
And that's why I don't like this in the game

2367
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Because we sit there and laugh at crossdressers

2368
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I don't know

2369
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
And I don't think that should be associated with same sex

2370
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
This one person is

2371
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's crossplay

2372
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Crossplay I like that

2373
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
I know plenty of female cosplayers

2374
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Who do male characters

2375
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
To comedic effect

2376
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And that's hot

2377
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Sometimes

2378
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
I've even considered doing a couple of costumes myself

2379
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
I wanted to go as Richter one year

2380
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
You know with the Ryu hairband look

2381
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And everything

2382
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
But you know I have a friend of mine who's very tall

2383
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Who went as

2384
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Larva from Vampire Princess Mio

2385
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
So

2386
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Alright Shauran in chat says

2387
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
My friend saw Manfay at her first con

2388
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I feel so bad for her

2389
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Alright getting away from Manfay and all this funny stuff

2390
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
For right now

2391
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
We were talking about the other story

2392
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
You know it's hard for me to sit here and go

2393
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
People should not find this offensive

2394
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
When in the same breath I'm looking at this story

2395
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
And I'm going you know what I'm kind of sort of offended

2396
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
At this story

2397
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I think it's different though

2398
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It is but I can't put my finger on it

2399
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Why should I be offended

2400
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
The difference being is that

2401
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
This is a specific component

2402
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Integral to the game

2403
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
This is something programmed specifically

2404
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Into the game

2405
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
As a facet of gameplay

2406
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
The other is background music

2407
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
That was made

2408
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
By someone of that faith

2409
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
It's

2410
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Now if that had been programmed in by

2411
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
The most flaming of all gay people ever

2412
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Would you be as offended

2413
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Yes

2414
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Because I think that person should know better

2415
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Okay but if that person

2416
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Personally thought it was

2417
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Funny and wondered why people would be offended

2418
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I mean I'm not like offended

2419
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Offended is not the word

2420
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I'm disappointed

2421
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'm disappointed that it's 2008

2422
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
And this is what I'm reporting on

2423
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Is that cross-dressing in the game will help your chance

2424
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
With same sex relationships

2425
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Can't we just move on

2426
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Why can't it just be

2427
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
If this game wants to be so big

2428
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
You have the character you want

2429
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And you program the same way

2430
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Why can't you just be

2431
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Why can't you just be the hero

2432
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
With muscles and I don't know

2433
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Whatever wearing manly clothes

2434
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
That attracts a lot of women

2435
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And 10% of men

2436
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
You know what I mean

2437
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Why can't we just have that

2438
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
You know what I think it should be

2439
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And keep in mind also

2440
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Not everyone who cross-dresses

2441
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Is gay

2442
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
We know this

2443
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Not everyone who

2444
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Who is gay cross-dresses

2445
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Also importantly true

2446
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Exactly and there are people

2447
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Who want to be that gender

2448
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I think that if they were

2449
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Going to incorporate something like that in the game

2450
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
And true it would be some very

2451
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Complex programming I do believe

2452
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It should be

2453
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
That you have the option of how you are going

2454
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
To make use of that option

2455
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
You know what I mean

2456
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
If you want to cross-dress because you want to be a woman

2457
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
You should have that as an option

2458
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I want boobs

2459
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Solid Goomba in chat says I want to be a man

2460
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
In a dress and have a relationship with a woman

2461
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
More power to you

2462
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
I do think the game should allow that

2463
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
If that's what you want

2464
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
You know what I mean I don't think cross-dressing should have a bearing on it

2465
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I don't know maybe I'm just

2466
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Maybe I just need to cool it but it just seems a little silly to me

2467
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
And you know if the designers

2468
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Take issue with how I'm reporting on that

2469
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Well look at the strategy guy the official strategy guy for the game

2470
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
That's where it comes from

2471
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
I agree that's boring

2472
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
It's like oh my god we got another flamer

2473
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Is the gay character in the game you know I don't know

2474
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
People need to get on with it

2475
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I'm just kind of getting sick of it

2476
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Like one of these days I would just like to have

2477
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
A normal person

2478
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Who happens to be gay in my video game

2479
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Just like you know in TV and all that

2480
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You know and even if sexuality

2481
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Is not a part of the game's device at all

2482
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Then fine we have no defined sexuality

2483
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
In the game that's just fine by me

2484
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
But amongst these RPG love stories I would like

2485
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
One day for there to be

2486
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
A same gender one that is not stupid

2487
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
If that makes sense

2488
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And you know that actually

2489
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Goes back to what I was talking about

2490
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
About the sort of

2491
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
A

2492
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Singular directional bigotry

2493
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
You know what I mean

2494
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I think that

2495
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Every you know

2496
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Every relationship is going to have its moments

2497
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Of dysfunction

2498
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Every relationship is you know some may have

2499
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
A very odd origin you know

2500
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
I ordered my husband on the internet

2501
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
You know

2502
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I think that

2503
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It doesn't have a quirk to it

2504
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
The quirk should be there because of the people involved

2505
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Not because of their orientation

2506
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Right

2507
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Um

2508
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Just one other thing though

2509
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I think though that having

2510
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
An active

2511
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
You know I don't even think it should be

2512
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
An active choice I think you should just

2513
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Start up your character and be born gay or not

2514
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Because really isn't that

2515
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
For the most part you know

2516
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
I think it's genetic

2517
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Progress

2518
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I think that

2519
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
As far as it being a part that does

2520
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Determine a lot of who your character

2521
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Is

2522
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
But it does not

2523
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Define who your character is

2524
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Um let me read some comments in chat here real quick

2525
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Because they're good

2526
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Acidic vampire says play indigo prophecy

2527
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
There's a normal quote unquote

2528
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Gay male in it

2529
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
And no I haven't and that's one of those Xbox games

2530
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
That like I should have played but I never did

2531
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Fair but you know I guess maybe we

2532
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Need a little more of that

2533
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
SG100Matt says I'm still waiting on a video game

2534
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Hero who happens to be Jewish

2535
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Fair enough

2536
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
But how often does religion come into video games

2537
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Of course then again

2538
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Saying all that with what we talked about earlier

2539
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
But you know just

2540
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
And then immediately follows

2541
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
That up and says just because they always grab coins

2542
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Doesn't mean they're Jewish

2543
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
See

2544
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I like that you can have a little fun with it

2545
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Alright

2546
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Look let's just move on

2547
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
And you know everybody's talking about

2548
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
They want to see representation of themselves

2549
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
GS68 I want more Filipino

2550
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Filipina characters dammit

2551
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
I'm sure there's a lot of people saying I want to see a little more

2552
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Of this in games so maybe it's time

2553
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
For diversity the game

2554
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I don't know it's a small world the game

2555
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Who knows I don't know

2556
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Let's move on there's plenty more gaming news to talk about

2557
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
If you want to talk more about it email us

2558
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Call us later

2559
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Take us to a game that has nothing to do with sexuality, religion or race at all

2560
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
This one's about falling into holes

2561
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
That could be construed as sexuality

2562
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah but how many holes do people really fall into

2563
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
I tripped there's a vagina

2564
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
You might wake up with a hangover

2565
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I think I fell into a hole while I was drunk

2566
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Anyway sorry go ahead

2567
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Okay anyway

2568
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Portal Still Alive

2569
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Is going to be on the Xbox Live arcade

2570
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
It will be

2571
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
It will

2572
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Be up on Wednesday October 22nd

2573
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
And

2574
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
It has the

2575
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
One that came out

2576
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Earlier

2577
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Plus 14 new exclusive

2578
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Challenge maps

2579
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
And 6 advanced maps

2580
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
And new achievements

2581
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So in other words if you bought the orange box

2582
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Just for this game

2583
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Haha sucker you're going to buy it twice

2584
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
But is Portal a game that you really

2585
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Mind buying twice I mean it is pretty freaking good

2586
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
There are different levels to be fair

2587
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Yeah to be fair I know

2588
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
There needs to be more GLaDOS

2589
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
On the PC

2590
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
First there will be cake and then you will be baked

2591
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
There's no story in the extra levels right?

2592
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
They're just kind of there

2593
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
It's just more crazy

2594
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Will you be taunted by GLaDOS in these bonus levels or are they just extra puzzles or something?

2595
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
What's the point of not being taunted?

2596
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I don't know

2597
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
That's why I'm curious to see like

2598
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
How

2599
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
How milked is this game?

2600
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
That's what I want to see like are they really just milking it

2601
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Or did they actually put a little thought into it?

2602
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
That's what I'm really curious to see

2603
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Who knows

2604
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Well

2605
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
One thing that you can probably store that brand new game on

2606
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Would be a hard drive

2607
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Or a new memory unit

2608
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And remember Microsoft was saying with the new

2609
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Xbox experience

2610
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
That you would need some sort of storage

2611
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Device in order to download it because it does take

2612
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
128 megs of space

2613
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Well their solution

2614
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
For people that

2615
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I don't know how they went about

2616
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Existing with an Xbox with no storage whatsoever

2617
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Because that means you can't save games or anything

2618
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
They are offering

2619
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
A free 512 megabyte memory unit

2620
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Or for 20 bucks

2621
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
You can buy a 20 gigabyte hard drive

2622
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Now in order to qualify for this

2623
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
You have to have a core system

2624
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Or some arcade systems

2625
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
May qualify as well

2626
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Basically just go to their

2627
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Website

2628
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
They have available for that

2629
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Which is xbox.com

2630
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Go to their support page

2631
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
And there is a memory update thing

2632
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Where you enter your serial number and console ID

2633
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Into the program

2634
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
And if you are eligible

2635
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Let you buy them

2636
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
If you are not eligible and you happen to have an arcade system

2637
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
That's the other option

2638
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
For $29.99 you can get a 20 gig hard drive

2639
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And a 3 month live card

2640
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Which is not a bad deal either

2641
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Now my question

2642
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
When I got my xbox 360

2643
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I have a core

2644
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Because I got my system during that time

2645
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
When xbox 360s were really hard to find

2646
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So I just ponied up the 20 extra dollars

2647
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Or whatever it was to buy the hard drive

2648
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
And the core system separately

2649
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
So is Microsoft going to know that I have had a hard drive this whole time

2650
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Or do you think you will qualify for this

2651
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Sweet! I get a free memory card

2652
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Right?

2653
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Awesome!

2654
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I'm good! Why not? It's free!

2655
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Microsoft doesn't know that I have a hard drive

2656
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
And even though I do

2657
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Why should I be treated differently

2658
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
From the other owners that bought the core

2659
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Early on, early adopters

2660
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Yeah!

2661
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
For 20 bucks you can get a 20 gig hard drive

2662
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
That could just be the drive I install

2663
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Final Fantasy XI on and never use

2664
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Or it could be

2665
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Or better yet

2666
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Because I only have a 20 gig hard drive as it is now

2667
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
I could have two drives and one of them

2668
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Can be like the movies drive

2669
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Or it could be the games drive

2670
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Why not?

2671
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
To be honest, I think that's an awesome solution

2672
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
For their problem

2673
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
And really, I mean

2674
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Who would not have a hard drive

2675
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Or a memory unit

2676
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I mean, seriously, I could see some people that may have

2677
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Only a 64 megabyte memory unit

2678
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Say they bought it back when the

2679
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Xbox 360 came out and stuff

2680
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
And they're only using it for, say, save games

2681
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
But, I mean

2682
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I can't imagine someone that would have

2683
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
An Xbox 360 that actually plays games

2684
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
That you have to progress in

2685
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
That does not have a way to save their game

2686
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Because that would be kind of retarded

2687
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
You have to start over every time

2688
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I didn't even know they made Xboxes without memories

2689
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Well, they don't anymore

2690
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
I have several people telling me in chat and

2691
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Aim and everywhere that, hey, Microsoft's gonna hear

2692
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
What you just said and you're screwed

2693
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
But, actually, it may even be before that

2694
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
No, it's not

2695
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Henderson Man in chat says, Sky, I have a core

2696
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
But it would not let me have a free memory card

2697
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
That's from Henderson Man in chat

2698
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
I don't think it's gonna, eh

2699
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Now I'm really curious, I'm gonna try it

2700
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I'll let you guys know what happens next week

2701
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Well, I've got about five different ones we can try

2702
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
We'll see what happens

2703
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I do, actually, I want to get a bigger hard drive

2704
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
But if I can get a 20 gig hard drive

2705
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Another one for cheap, I'll do that switch out idea

2706
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I think it's a great idea

2707
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
So, we'll see

2708
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Anyhow, thank you, Microsoft

2709
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
For giving us some free stuff

2710
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Right?

2711
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Alright, moving on to some more news

2712
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And talking about the Xbox 360

2713
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
A little further, and the Zune

2714
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
I don't know how many folks out there actually own Zunes

2715
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I know it's got a loyal following

2716
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
There's a few people out there that own the Zunes

2717
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
But, you know, they're

2718
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
They're trying to increase

2719
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
The amount of flexibility that

2720
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Or, I should say, compatibility that occurs between the two

2721
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
You know, with the media sharing

2722
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
And, you know, the things that go on between the 360 and the Zune

2723
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Well, actually, recently

2724
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Some folks were

2725
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Over at Gizmodo were talking about the new Gears of War

2726
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Zune that's coming out

2727
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And they were actually talking to Microsoft's marketing director

2728
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
And the marketing director

2729
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Was talking about that there is going to be a big

2730
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Step up

2731
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Happening in the Zune 360 integration within

2732
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
A year

2733
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
So, that's all, it's a very vague statement

2734
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But that supposedly

2735
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
It's going to step it up within a year

2736
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Any thoughts as to what that could possibly be?

2737
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Well, they already have the XNA

2738
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Support that's supposed to be coming to it

2739
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
They're going to flesh that out a little bit more

2740
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And maybe it would be kind of cool

2741
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
They actually put some games on there

2742
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Like, you know, they could even be like

2743
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
The Pocket Station stuff where you play a little mini game

2744
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
You earn points for a game or something

2745
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I have a thought, and I bet money I'm right

2746
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Movies

2747
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
You're going to be able to play movies on the Zune that you bought on Xbox

2748
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I could see that happening

2749
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
It's going to be how they're going to compete with iPod

2750
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Rob

2751
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Remember when they were talking about the Zune E3?

2752
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Right

2753
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Didn't they bring up something to that effect

2754
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
That it would be like a multi-entertainment

2755
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
I remember going in there with my camera

2756
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
And them telling me to turn it off

2757
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
At the Xbox 360 thing

2758
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
And they were talking about having portable content

2759
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
So perhaps this is what they intended

2760
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Cobra Kid says more XNA games to it in chat

2761
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
That's true, they have that whole XNA thing coming out soon

2762
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
That could be a big part of it too

2763
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
So maybe it's all of it

2764
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
It could be just as much as the iPhone interfaces

2765
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
With your Mac or even your personal computer

2766
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Maybe the Zune will interface with the Xbox 360

2767
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Who knows

2768
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Will there be enough people that use it

2769
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Or just a quick question in chat

2770
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Let's say the Zune could do all of those things you suggested

2771
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Let's say the Zune can do the XNA games

2772
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Let's say the Zune can do the movies

2773
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
And all that stuff

2774
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Would you be interested in a Zune chat room

2775
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
As opposed to an iPhone

2776
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Or any of the other stuff that's out there

2777
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Let's say you can only have one player

2778
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Would you pick Zune

2779
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Comment from Tigerclaw

2780
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Tigerclaw says doesn't the Zune have built in Wi-Fi

2781
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
They could make apps for it

2782
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Like for example someone would eventually make an internet radio app

2783
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
To tune into the shotcast streams over the Wi-Fi

2784
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
We'll see

2785
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
We'll come back to that story

2786
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Just after we get this next story out of the way

2787
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
This actually makes me a little bit happy

2788
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Even though I already own the game

2789
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
On multiple platforms

2790
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Marvel vs Capcom 2

2791
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Which

2792
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Honestly I thought the first one was a little bit better

2793
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
But um

2794
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
It actually has an ESRB rating now

2795
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
For PS3 and Xbox 360

2796
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
So that leads speculation

2797
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
That it's going to be a

2798
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Downloadable version

2799
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Maybe like a

2800
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Xbox Live Arcade

2801
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Or something like that

2802
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
And that's pretty cool

2803
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
I mean it's a good game

2804
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
So I'm looking forward to that

2805
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
It's a fucking awesome game you mean

2806
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
By good

2807
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
It's all about

2808
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Playing a Strider hear you anyway

2809
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Okay looking at chatroom comments

2810
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
From the last story because we asked you guys would you get one

2811
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
And would you get a Zune if they

2812
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Implemented all these features

2813
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
VxJsonXV says Zunes blow

2814
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Rama says yes

2815
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
GameGuru says maybe but I'm more interested in PSP right now

2816
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
Sharan says sure why not

2817
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
VxJsonXV continues I have my iPhone

2818
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
And I'm happy with it

2819
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Redertainment says does it do much better than my current touch

2820
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
If not no I need a gross incentive to jump over

2821
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
That's how I feel

2822
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
There's got to be something really big to get me to have a Zune

2823
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
As well as an iPhone

2824
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Cobra Kid says I would have to get a bigger Zune

2825
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Deekman says I'm telling you they'll merge the music card and the gamer tag

2826
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I didn't even think of that

2827
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
That could be so we'll see

2828
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Alright

2829
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
So Marvel vs Capcom 2 hopefully coming soon

2830
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
As it says

2831
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Meanwhile some other news

2832
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
Right Loki?

2833
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Sorry someone was stepping on my mic

2834
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Are our guests being unruly?

2835
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
They are being very unruly

2836
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
They need to be punished

2837
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
We're playing naughty tic tac toe

2838
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Anyways

2839
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
If you live in Europe you're going to

2840
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Be in for a lot of holiday bundles

2841
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
For the Xbox 360

2842
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
They are getting quite a few

2843
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
In fact starting

2844
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Well last week actually

2845
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
The value packs that are available

2846
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Pretty much all around the world

2847
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Are available for them as well

2848
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
That includes of course the games packed in

2849
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda

2850
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
For both the Elite and Pro

2851
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
And the Sega Superstar Tennis

2852
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
And of course the Xbox Live arcade games

2853
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Starting

2854
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Looks like

2855
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
November 7th

2856
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
They're going to be getting two more bundles

2857
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Both with the 60GB Pro system

2858
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
And either Gears of War 2 bundled in

2859
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Or James Bond 007 Quantum of Solus bundled in

2860
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
And those are going to both be available

2861
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
For 269 euros

2862
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Starting

2863
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
The 21st of November

2864
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
There's going to be another one with

2865
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Tomb Raider Underworld

2866
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
And that's also a Pro system

2867
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
The 60GB with a 1200

2868
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Microsoft points card

2869
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
And that's also available for 269 euros

2870
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
And then finally

2871
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
The Last Stitch effort before Christmas

2872
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
There's another 60GB Pro system

2873
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Bundled with

2874
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Prince of Persia

2875
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
And that will also be for 269 euros

2876
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So

2877
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
A little bit more expensive than your normal games

2878
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Your normal Lake Pro system

2879
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I mean

2880
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Basically you're kind of paying for the game itself

2881
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Anyways

2882
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
But hey that's kind of neat

2883
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I guess if you're shopping for the holidays

2884
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Lots and lots to pick from

2885
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Why do you think so many bundles over there

2886
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Are supposed to here?

2887
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I think it may have been just

2888
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
And I'm not even sure if it's actually

2889
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
It could very well be

2890
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Like different

2891
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Say bundles that are being

2892
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Done by retailers and stuff like that

2893
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I don't know if these are official

2894
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Or what the case may be

2895
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I don't know it's interesting

2896
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
I guess

2897
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Alright well hey one game that they aren't

2898
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Bundling in right now is Castle Crashers

2899
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Maybe someday

2900
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Some people will tell you Castle Crashers is still borked

2901
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
That it's online multiplayer mode is still

2902
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Not that great and we've been waiting and waiting

2903
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And waiting for a patch well

2904
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Guess what Behemoth the developer of the game

2905
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Has just posted on their site this week that

2906
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
They have figured out how to fix the problem

2907
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
They have finished the patch and it is

2908
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Currently waiting on certification

2909
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
For Microsoft I'm sorry they are currently verifying

2910
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
The updates and then they're going to be sending it off to Microsoft

2911
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
For certification which has probably

2912
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Already happened

2913
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Kind of took them long enough in a way

2914
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
I mean with as long as this game took

2915
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
To come out I mean couldn't they just kind of like

2916
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
Fix this before it came out

2917
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
I mean I don't know I guess you know they didn't know

2918
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
They tested the game they didn't find it

2919
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Mistakes happened blah blah blah

2920
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
But it's a little bit frustrating this game has been out how long

2921
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And you still can't really have a multiplayer game on it

2922
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
But I guess to their credit

2923
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
You know a lot of people bought this game anyway

2924
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
And hearing about this patch is just going to cause

2925
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Another wave of people

2926
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Running out to get this game

2927
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Whereas a lot of Xbox Live Arcade titles kind of have

2928
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
One shot the week they come out

2929
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And then they kind of slip into obscurity

2930
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Maybe it was pre-planned who knows

2931
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
I doubt it though

2932
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Alright

2933
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Well something pre-planned on Orange Lounge Radio is that

2934
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Every week we are going to take some time to read your

2935
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Emails that you send us to mailbag at

2936
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

2937
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Why are you boycotting the mailbag?

2938
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
I will get you a damn cookie if you read the emails

2939
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Hey FartPrincess

2940
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Doctor do you guys want

2941
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I have flat fortune cookies

2942
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
They taste like pancakes

2943
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Oh my

2944
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Well Dark Soccer reads us some email

2945
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
There is an email that I should have sent in response

2946
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
To you directly Rob

2947
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
And I don't know if I should read it on air

2948
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Well if you read this first

2949
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Then I am going to have to wait on the cookies

2950
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Okay you can just read it at your leisure

2951
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Well give me a brief idea of what it's about

2952
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
It's from Spazinator

2953
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Hi

2954
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Telling you what games you should get for PS3

2955
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Oh

2956
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Didn't I say, I think I said a while back

2957
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
About something like I need more

2958
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Games that I should

2959
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
What games?

2960
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
LocoRoco

2961
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Cocorecto

2962
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
How are there, Lemmings, Elephunk

2963
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
EchoChrome, WipeoutHD

2964
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Everyday Shooter, Super Puzzle Fight

2965
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Are you farting glasses?

2966
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
What are you doing?

2967
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Knock it off

2968
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Trying to do a show

2969
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Wait did they just list

2970
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Every game that's not

2971
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
A list of 36 games Rob

2972
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Just basically all the PS3 exclusives

2973
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Some

2974
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Some are not

2975
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
To be fair I am going to get a PS3

2976
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
LittleBigPlanet is out

2977
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Sooner rather than later

2978
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
There is more tips on what else you should get along with

2979
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
And what you should look for

2980
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I am having surgery soon

2981
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
So you know

2982
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Probably having a blu-ray player will be a good thing

2983
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
As they recover

2984
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
So let's go on to the next email

2985
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
While I go get the cookies

2986
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
The next email

2987
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Is actually from

2988
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Did you lose a sock?

2989
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
No I know where my socks are

2990
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Cookie!

2991
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Bye

2992
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Now

2993
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Rob

2994
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Heart

2995
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
We love you

2996
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
So excited for the cookies

2997
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Okay

2998
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Never mind I was told not to

2999
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Read this email on the air

3000
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
So I've already addressed this situation

3001
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Multiple times before

3002
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
So stop reminding me I know

3003
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Heart

3004
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
And then

3005
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
We only really have one other email

3006
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
And it's actually

3007
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
From

3008
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Dan Shadow

3009
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Hey guys my nephew's birthday

3010
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Was last week so I missed the show

3011
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Took him to the movie of his choice

3012
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And he chose, wait for it, quarantine

3013
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Yeah it sucked so bad

3014
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I mean it was so bad

3015
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That people would start talking during the movie and no one

3016
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Cared, fucking rabies

3017
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Anyways

3018
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Been trying to catch up on my OLR since I had

3019
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
To leave in the middle of another episode

3020
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Just got one episode on Friday

3021
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
And I'm sure

3022
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
I guess you meant to have the word

3023
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Rob

3024
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I'm on the last email

3025
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Rob's gay

3026
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I'm sure I'll get the other one soon

3027
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Been playing Dead Space this week

3028
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I recommend it to anyone who has a good

3029
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Sound setup

3030
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Thank you, ooh cookie

3031
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It's not as scary visually

3032
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
As much as it is audibly

3033
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
The visuals are great

3034
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
They're just not as scary as the

3035
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
EA's, as EA's been telling all of us

3036
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Man can you believe the news this week

3037
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
LittleBigPlanet gets delayed, Ghostbusters gets

3038
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Picked back up and Obama's appearing in video games

3039
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Didn't a caller bring that up a few weeks ago

3040
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Oh and before I forget

3041
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Ballhair says hi

3042
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
He's got a last name now and he's doing well

3043
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
He's got a guild and we're at guild level 14

3044
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
At this moment

3045
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
And we're talking keeps

3046
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
And we're taking keeps

3047
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Is it Ballhair Jenkins? Oh wait no

3048
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Ballhair was a Warhammer character right?

3049
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Yeah I'm looking

3050
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
Ballhair Trimmer

3051
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
The Dawnbringer

3052
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Nice

3053
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Ballhair Trimmer

3054
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
That's lovely

3055
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
And Ballhair got a guild

3056
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Congratulations

3057
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
That's it for email?

3058
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
We have one from

3059
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Entertainment

3060
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Less email, more cookie? Oh yes

3061
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
One more email

3062
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I mean this is actually in response

3063
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
But we were cc'd on this so I'm gonna read it

3064
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Alright

3065
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I brought, this is from Entertainment

3066
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I bought LittleBigPlanet

3067
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
On Friday

3068
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
And found out about the recall right before I sent this message

3069
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
What the expletive deleted

3070
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
For Bobby fuck for OLR should I do?

3071
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Should I contact Sony

3072
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Wait for a patch or keep the game as

3073
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
A collector's item and buy another copy?

3074
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Thank you for your time

3075
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Entertainment

3076
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Yes that's an awesome idea, let's call Sony

3077
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
And tell them not only did you break street on the game

3078
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
He didn't break street, the person that sold it

3079
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Broke street

3080
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
Keep it

3081
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
And then buy another one

3082
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Keep it, collector's item, maybe the serial number or something will be different

3083
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Do not open it

3084
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Yeah well he probably already did because he didn't know about the

3085
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Change

3086
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Just hang on to it, Sony's gonna patch it out

3087
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Anyway so you're not gonna really have a choice

3088
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Cause they're doing both but

3089
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
The serial number on that box will make

3090
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
It's gonna be like those pennies that have

3091
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Like the misprint on the back

3092
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
You know those type of things, that's what it's gonna be

3093
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
If you wanna play your copy

3094
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
That's been unedited then

3095
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Just come in from the internet

3096
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Yeah entertainment's in chat right now

3097
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It says he already opened it cause how would he know

3098
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
That it was gonna be recalled so

3099
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Can't say I blame you there

3100
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Alright let's get back, if that's it for Mailbag

3101
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com

3102
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
While we chow down on cookies

3103
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Loki the cookie hater

3104
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
Here's one more thing

3105
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Ow I hit myself in the face with the microphone

3106
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
Was that the thing?

3107
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
You know what Rob

3108
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
One thing that I

3109
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Every so often will get an email on

3110
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
And I'm meant to plug it during my classic game

3111
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Of the week

3112
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Was a review done by

3113
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Sauce

3114
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Oh yes I was reading about this on Twitter

3115
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
And I am getting the link now

3116
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Cause if you go to Twitter.com

3117
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Slash Mar and Marvel there is a link to it

3118
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
And her review of

3119
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
The week is Actraiser

3120
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
For classic game review

3121
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
I know isn't it great

3122
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
We just had an exclamation of

3123
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I love Actraiser

3124
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
So go look at it I'm linking it in the chatroom

3125
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
And I'll link it on our Twitter

3126
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Irene's god name in Actraiser

3127
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
Is Poop

3128
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Oh Actraiser I love Actraiser

3129
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
How funny that's what I named Link

3130
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
In Legend of Zelda was Poop

3131
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Wow copycat

3132
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
I named him GGG cause I was lazy

3133
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Nice

3134
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I named him Zelda so I could get the extra

3135
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
No I'm kidding

3136
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Back to news cookie hater

3137
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Okay

3138
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Well there is some controversy

3139
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Around another game Saints Row 2

3140
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Apparently New York

3141
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Police unions condemn Saints Row 2

3142
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Because well you kill policemen

3143
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
In the game

3144
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
And according to them

3145
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
New York's powerful police unions say that

3146
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
A violent video

3147
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Or a violent new video game called Saints Row 2

3148
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Is an abomination

3149
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
In the game the players control a gang member

3150
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Who can steal do drugs

3151
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Kill as many characters as possible

3152
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Including police officers

3153
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Well you said it right there

3154
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
They're killing everybody so you know what

3155
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
I'm pissed off at Saints Row 2

3156
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Because they're killing doctors

3157
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
And prostitutes

3158
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And college students

3159
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
And cookies

3160
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Do unions for college students coming out

3161
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
You know

3162
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
I'm a college student and I'm offended

3163
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Or taxi drivers

3164
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Or rednecks

3165
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Do unions for students exist

3166
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
They have the student union

3167
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I guess that makes sense huh

3168
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
The whole thing is just like

3169
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Okay this doesn't take place in New York

3170
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
So

3171
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
God yeah

3172
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Because you know what before this game

3173
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
No one's ever thought hey you know what

3174
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
We can kill cops in it

3175
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
This is the first game to ever do that

3176
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Thank you for pointing this out

3177
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
This also I might add

3178
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Comes from

3179
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
WPEC

3180
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
News 12 now

3181
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
As you know

3182
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
They're a CBS affiliate

3183
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
And I would assume

3184
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
The New York area

3185
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
But I could be wrong

3186
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Redertainment in chat says I'm mad because they can kill

3187
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Redheaded dorks

3188
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Me too I should be angered about that too

3189
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Actually

3190
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
So is the doctor he's waving his hand over there I'm pissed too

3191
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Yeah I don't even know where the hell this

3192
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Takes place it's somewhere on the east coast

3193
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
That this um

3194
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Actual uh newscast is from

3195
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
To which the legend of Zaku

3196
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Promptly follows up and says yay I didn't know

3197
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
You can kill gingers in the game

3198
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Like it's incentive to buy it now

3199
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Oh gingers

3200
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Alright

3201
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Oh North Carolina

3202
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Not even close

3203
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Rama in chat says news channel 12 is a local

3204
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
Cable news network

3205
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I don't know

3206
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Alright well look um

3207
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
This kind of just dumbass-edness

3208
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Always brings on our FUs of the week

3209
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And especially since Saints Row

3210
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Is a game that Loki loves and adores

3211
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
How dare the police department condemn it

3212
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:36,000
You can condemn it all they want

3213
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Dark Sakura FUs of the week

3214
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
The election season

3215
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
All of it

3216
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
And um

3217
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Sarah Palin for thinking she's funny

3218
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Loki

3219
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Um

3220
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
God I had something early

3221
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
That I was mad at about

3222
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
But I don't remember so

3223
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
FU to news 12

3224
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Because they have

3225
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Looks like a

3226
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Cast of douchebags that run this thing

3227
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
They're all kind of ugly in weird ways

3228
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Um

3229
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
My FU of the week goes to still not having

3230
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Like a solid date for my surgery

3231
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Like I think I know when it's gonna be

3232
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
But because some people haven't gotten to my

3233
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Paperwork I only kind of know that it's

3234
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Probably gonna be not

3235
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
This coming week but the next week

3236
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
So there you go

3237
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Uh fart princess do you have any FUs of the week?

3238
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
The doctor? Somebody?

3239
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I'm the doctor

3240
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
And I'm mad

3241
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
At poop

3242
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I'm the doctor

3243
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Thank you doctor

3244
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
The parent has one

3245
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
How about the real doctor?

3246
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
My FUs is all the

3247
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
Crazy yes on 8 signs

3248
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
In Amador County

3249
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
No you don't even know

3250
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
It's like a gauntlet you go through town and there's about

3251
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
70,000 of them

3252
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
I already went off on Prop 8 last week

3253
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
So fuck you to everyone in Amador

3254
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
County who's gonna vote yes on 8

3255
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Protect my rights bitch

3256
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
If it makes you feel better

3257
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I already voted and I voted no

3258
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Absentee

3259
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Fart princess do you have any real

3260
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
FUs?

3261
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
FU to poop

3262
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Alright

3263
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
The ferret has one

3264
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Oh ferret yes ferret would like me to FU

3265
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Thank you very much

3266
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I agree with you ferret

3267
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
The ferret is saying to vote no on 8 as well

3268
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Exactly

3269
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Alright let's get back into some gaming news

3270
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Sellers of Catan you guys know this game from

3271
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Xbox Live or you probably know the original board game

3272
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Hello

3273
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
It kind of broke

3274
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I found some walls when it came to Xbox Live arcade

3275
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
Because it was the first, besides Uno

3276
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
It was the first really in depth board game

3277
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
To really come out

3278
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
On Xbox Live and that was really cool

3279
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
But now it's not gonna stop there

3280
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Sellers of Catan is coming out on the Nintendo DS

3281
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
As well

3282
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
It's actually gonna be a version of a mobile

3283
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Game that's coming out called

3284
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Catan the first island but of course

3285
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
The graphics and such will be much better than they are on mobile

3286
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
So there's even a trailer up for it

3287
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
On YouTube and you can take a look at it

3288
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
And of course if you don't know what Catan is

3289
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
It's a game about bartering and trading

3290
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
It's kind of like Civilization and board game format

3291
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Except it made no sense to me

3292
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
When I tried to learn how to play it

3293
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
But I have a limited attention span for these types of things

3294
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
What? I was more of a Carcassonne fan

3295
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
What? Exactly

3296
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Who? Yep, you got it

3297
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
What about carcasses? No

3298
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Just no

3299
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
How about games we do understand

3300
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Games where we just shoot and kill things

3301
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Well kind of sorta

3302
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
We have ratings

3303
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
For the ESRB for stuff to come out on Virtual Console

3304
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
And that would be

3305
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Metal Slug 2

3306
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
You can ride a camel in it

3307
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And the camel has a gatling gun

3308
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Watch out, they spit

3309
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
This one spits bullets

3310
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Out of his hip

3311
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Awesome

3312
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Best camel ever

3313
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
The other game is

3314
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
A boy and his blob

3315
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Trouble on Blobolonia

3316
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
This is a DS version that was supposed to come out

3317
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Did it ever come out?

3318
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I don't think it ever did actually

3319
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
It never came out

3320
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Maybe the publisher went under, I don't know

3321
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Get those jelly beans ready

3322
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Jelly beans

3323
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
That's it

3324
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Nobody gets that

3325
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
You have to feed him jelly beans

3326
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
No, I get that

3327
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
It may actually have come out

3328
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I'm looking, there's a little review

3329
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Here

3330
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
It's actually come out

3331
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I'm looking here to see

3332
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Oh no, it was cancelled

3333
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
They had a box art and everything

3334
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
And the release was cancelled

3335
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
That's sadness

3336
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
It didn't really peak my interest anyway

3337
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
When we went to E3 and we saw it

3338
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Rob, that makes my heart hurt

3339
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I know, it makes my heart hurt too

3340
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
But we have a new one coming out

3341
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Well the Virtual Console one

3342
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Yeah, that's ok

3343
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
It's the same damn game I've already played

3344
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
I should just play the Nintendo

3345
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Before we get back into some news

3346
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I want to take a little detour because you guys got to the show late

3347
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
You didn't get to talk about your gaming week

3348
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
But you were telling me, Fart Princess

3349
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
That there was a game you wanted to talk about

3350
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Yes, there is

3351
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I've been playing Hello Kitty online

3352
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
For real, this isn't a joke

3353
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
No, why would it be a joke?

3354
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
There really is a Hello Kitty online?

3355
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Yeah, didn't you see that person

3356
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Post a link in your livestream?

3357
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Yes, but it's for the sake of the radio

3358
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Rob, I'd appreciate it if you stopped farting

3359
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
That's really rude

3360
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Shut up and tell us about the game

3361
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
No, I haven't checked it out

3362
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Tell us about the game, what do you do in the game?

3363
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
Do you get to play as Hello Kitty?

3364
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
No, you play as a boy or a girl character

3365
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Do you have a mouth?

3366
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I don't remember

3367
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
I think you do

3368
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I'm pretty sure you have a butt too

3369
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
You can like

3370
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
You're interrupting me, Rob

3371
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
What?

3372
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
What's so funny?

3373
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Nothing, go ahead

3374
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
Rob!

3375
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Jeez, Rob, close your eyes

3376
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Knock it off, gaming news

3377
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
I'm not going to let you talk about Hello Kitty

3378
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
If you don't get to it

3379
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Hello farty

3380
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
You level the traditional sense of an MMO

3381
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
But there's no

3382
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
You can't kill anything in the game

3383
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Unless you fart on it

3384
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
The way you level in the game is

3385
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Fatal flatulence

3386
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Yes, that's totally it

3387
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
You forage for stuff

3388
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
Like you gather plants and stuff

3389
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
And then when you eat it, you go

3390
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:54,000
That was a long fart

3391
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Wow, that took all of my breath

3392
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
My butt breath

3393
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Your butt breath?

3394
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
You're derailing the show, Rob

3395
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
And you fight enemies too

3396
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
But you don't kill them

3397
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Are they giant enemy crabs?

3398
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
They are, they're crabs

3399
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Or do they just give you crabs?

3400
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
They might do that too

3401
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
They might also give you gas

3402
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Like

3403
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Stop it, Rob

3404
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
New from Squeenix, fatal flatulence

3405
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
And that's basically

3406
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:34,000
The gist of the game

3407
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Look what you did, Rob

3408
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
You should be ashamed of yourself

3409
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
Now I'm thinking there actually should be a game

3410
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Called Hello Farty

3411
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Alright, stop it

3412
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
People in the chatroom are complaining about their speakers

3413
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:52,000
They should be complaining about the smell

3414
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Can we get on to some gaming?

3415
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I thought I would actually learn something about Hello Kitty

3416
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
I told you about it, all about it

3417
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
You just farted a lot

3418
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
You didn't even listen

3419
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
SSJ100Matt says Rob's gonna write a hate letter to the show

3420
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
That is true

3421
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Uh, Loki

3422
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I'm gonna make sure that before the podcast goes out

3423
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
We strip out all the fart noises

3424
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Then it wouldn't make sense

3425
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
We're gonna patch it for day one release

3426
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
So that anybody who does obtain the podcast early

3427
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Does not get to hear the fart noises

3428
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I'm gonna be replaced with birds chirping

3429
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Aw, that'd be great

3430
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Then we'd be giggling at birds chirping

3431
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Alright

3432
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I'm gonna be Hello Birdy

3433
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
How about Rock Band?

3434
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
How about Rock Band?

3435
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Rock Band 2 is coming to the Wii in November

3436
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
And with it

3437
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
All the features that you love in Rock Band 2

3438
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
On the other platforms

3439
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Including, you will be able to download

3440
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
The Rock Band 1 tracks

3441
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
As well when they become available

3442
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
And also

3443
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
That the Guitar Hero 3 controller

3444
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Will work with the game now

3445
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
So that's kinda cool

3446
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
And of course any additional download content will be available

3447
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
On the network as well

3448
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And you can store them on your SD memory card

3449
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
So that's kinda cool

3450
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Sweet

3451
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I played a demo of this and dare I say

3452
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I pwned at the drums

3453
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Good

3454
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Because I suck at drums

3455
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
So we should start a band

3456
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Wait, so you have Rock Band on the Wii?

3457
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
No, but they had a demo

3458
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Oh, I see

3459
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
So you haven't really played Rock Band

3460
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
You've been in a Best Buy band

3461
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Alright

3462
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Wii Music

3463
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
The other type of band game

3464
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Wii Music is doing very well in Japan

3465
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I know it's been getting a little bit of negative press around the fan

3466
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Well actually

3467
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Here's what I'm curious about

3468
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Doctor

3469
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
You're a big giant Nintendo whore

3470
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Like you love everything Nintendo

3471
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Now we're kinda not feeling Wii Music

3472
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Nope

3473
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
By Wii

3474
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
He means himself

3475
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
And Loki

3476
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I would like to point out that Dark Saga has said she wouldn't pay for it

3477
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
No

3478
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I might have paid for it if I didn't know I was getting one for free

3479
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Anyhow

3480
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
The Doctor

3481
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Are you interested in Wii Music at all?

3482
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Why not?

3483
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I am the biggest Nintendo

3484
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
And I'm just like

3485
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I'm kinda bored with these completely novelty games

3486
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Like

3487
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
You know, there's so many cool things

3488
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
That they could do on the Wii

3489
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
And they're just not

3490
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
And I'm just like, okay, here's another game

3491
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Where you get to wave the Wii mode around

3492
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
And I'm just like, ugh

3493
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Alright, well guess what

3494
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
The country of Japan disagrees with us

3495
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
And agrees with Dark Sakura

3496
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
According to Famitsu

3497
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I'm sorry, according to Famitsu's publisher

3498
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
50,000 units were sold on

3499
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Day 1 in Japan

3500
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
So the game is doing huge in Japan

3501
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
And sold a lot

3502
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Like it or not, it looks like this game

3503
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Will probably have similar success

3504
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Over here, but again, you know

3505
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
To recap what we've kinda said before on this program

3506
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
At least myself

3507
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
If it gets young kids interested in music

3508
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
It's not a bad thing, but for this old kid

3509
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
No thank you, I'll pass

3510
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
So

3511
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
More gaming news

3512
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Just one more

3513
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Then we're gonna open up the Skype line pretty soon

3514
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
At 877-GAME-OLR

3515
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Nice plug

3516
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Nice plug

3517
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Well, this goes back to a series

3518
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
That was one of the first ones I ever played

3519
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
When the Playstation first came out

3520
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
In fact, it was one of the

3521
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
First games that anyone played

3522
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
On the Playstation when it first came out

3523
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
It was Toshinden

3524
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I love Toshinden

3525
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Actually, the third one was great

3526
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Because it was awful

3527
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
It had the butt monkey in it and the guy with the chainsaw

3528
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Named David

3529
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
He did the butt monkey dance!

3530
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Okay

3531
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
No, he was like a baboon and he had a big red butt

3532
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
And whenever he went

3533
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
He would do this little clappy dance

3534
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
With his butt

3535
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
So anyway

3536
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
There's actually news

3537
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
In Famitsu that says

3538
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Takara Tomy is going to be bringing

3539
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Out the Toshinden series on the Wii

3540
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
So maybe they'll actually

3541
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Make it better?

3542
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Who knows?

3543
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
You get to spank the monkey's butt

3544
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
But it looks kinda cool

3545
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I love Toshinden

3546
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
You know, I guess

3547
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Retro games making a comeback is nothing new

3548
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
In this current gen world

3549
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
I need to go

3550
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
That just means I need to go find that issue of Famitsu

3551
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Wario Land is pretty good for that

3552
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Wario Land?

3553
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Have you bought the new Wario Land?

3554
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
It's very good

3555
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
It's this great 2D animation

3556
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
It's good

3557
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Anyhow, sorry

3558
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Let's talk about PC games a little bit quickly

3559
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
No! Boycott!

3560
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Well, there's no boycott

3561
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Yet

3562
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
But Far Cry 2 is going to be bundled with

3563
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Everybody's favorite sport

3564
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Digital Rights Management

3565
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
You can get Securom

3566
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Technology

3567
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Along with Far Cry 2

3568
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
It will be

3569
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
It will have these restrictions

3570
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
The purchasers will have up to

3571
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Five activations on three

3572
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Separate PCs

3573
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Uninstalling Far Cry 2

3574
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Refunds in activation

3575
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
This process is known as a revoke

3576
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
As long as you properly uninstall the game

3577
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
You'll be able to reinstall it an unlimited

3578
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Number of times on three machines

3579
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
A computer

3580
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Can be upgraded an unlimited

3581
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Number of times using revoke

3582
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Ubisoft is

3583
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Willing to provide additional activations

3584
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
If necessary

3585
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Ubisoft is committed to a long term support

3586
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Of their games

3587
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
And you'll always be able to play Far Cry 2

3588
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
So apparently

3589
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
This is what they're going to start doing from now on

3590
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I don't understand why they're still using Securom

3591
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Technology since it can be so easily broken

3592
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
And people just hate it in general

3593
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
But do people as a whole

3594
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Do they really seem to care?

3595
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Well, not according to EA who says that

3596
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
With a small percentage

3597
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
They're claiming that 99.8%

3598
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Of consumers will never notice

3599
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
The digital rights management

3600
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
That's in the game

3601
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Which I think is kind of sad that they don't notice

3602
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
That it's in there because it could potentially

3603
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Harm their system

3604
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Especially when it comes to

3605
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
CD burning software and stuff like that

3606
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Whatever that it interrupts

3607
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
And the fact that these people are unaware

3608
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
That this game is actually causing this problem

3609
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
That they will go take it in

3610
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
And cost them money

3611
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
But either way they say we can eliminate piracy

3612
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
By essentially blocking the online service

3613
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
From the pirate

3614
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
It's called the future of

3615
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Digital rights management

3616
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Well, that's nice, you know, but some people don't really care about

3617
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
The online portion of your game

3618
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
And they will still pirate it

3619
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
In fact, I think there was quite a few copies

3620
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Of Spore that were pirated

3621
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And to be honest, all they're losing

3622
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Is the online portion of it

3623
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
And if you really don't give a crap about seeing other people's penis monsters

3624
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Then you can still play the game

3625
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
LegendofZaco in chat says

3626
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Gotta love EA pulling voodoo stats out of their asses

3627
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Is that what this is?

3628
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
I think so

3629
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I mean

3630
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I don't know, we don't know for sure how many people actually know about it

3631
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
So we have to take their word for it

3632
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
It's not necessarily that they're pulling it out of their ass

3633
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
It's just the way they report the numbers

3634
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
That's just politics

3635
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Anyhow

3636
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
It's like they think that people that are complaining about it are gonna go

3637
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Oh, well, okay

3638
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
So not that many people are complaining about it

3639
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I guess I'll just stop complaining

3640
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
You're right

3641
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
No, that's not gonna happen

3642
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Anyhow, one more story

3643
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Then we're gonna get to some calls on the skype line

3644
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
And this one has to do with Ghostbusters

3645
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
You know that game that we hear things about it

3646
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Then it goes away, then it comes back

3647
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
Well, people are talking about Ghostbusters again

3648
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
And it's all thanks to Dan Aykroyd

3649
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Which of course is one of the actors in the original movie

3650
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
And he was on a Dallas radio station this week

3651
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
105.3

3652
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
And he talked to the radio station

3653
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
And actually confirmed that the Ghostbusters title

3654
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Has been picked up by Atari to be published

3655
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
And said that the game

3656
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Will be less than a year away from being released

3657
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
So apparently

3658
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
It is confirmed that Atari

3659
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Has picked up the game

3660
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
And Atari will be publishing the game

3661
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Don't expect to see it tomorrow, though

3662
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
They're saying the polish and cleaning up the game

3663
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Could take as long as May of 2009

3664
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
So you'll see this game

3665
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
At some point next year

3666
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
That could also mean Christmas 2009

3667
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
That's crazier than a

3668
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Vaporous full torso apparition

3669
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Thanks

3670
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
That makes me giddy

3671
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
But we're talking about piss in the chat room

3672
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Um, okay

3673
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Exactly

3674
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Chat.orangelandsradio.com for an experience

3675
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
That really can't be described

3676
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Oh my

3677
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
It's talking about scientific fact

3678
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
That urine is a sterile solution

3679
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Do you ever talk games in the

3680
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Area of medical curiosity?

3681
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Do you pee on your video games?

3682
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Someone brought up peeing in the shower

3683
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
And I was

3684
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I was making fun and doing the girly thing

3685
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Who wants to stand in their own piss?

3686
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
1877 game O.L.R.

3687
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Now is a great time

3688
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Now is an excellent time

3689
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I hope Sigourney Weaver is in the game

3690
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Yes, the acidic vampire

3691
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Is a very good point

3692
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
And of course Dark Tetsuya brings up

3693
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
O.L.R. is like pissing in an ocean of piss

3694
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Will the game be nearly as cool

3695
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
As the Commodore 64 version

3696
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Of Ghostbusters? That's what I want to know

3697
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Dude, you are red

3698
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I love that the first

3699
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Half of the show was really smart

3700
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
And intelligent and the second half has been nothing

3701
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
But piss and fart

3702
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
God

3703
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
This show is just so strange

3704
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Maybe our caller

3705
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Let's go to the phones

3706
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
We have a caller, let's see if they're gonna

3707
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
What IQ level they're at tonight

3708
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?

3709
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
This is Ranma, who is just as immature

3710
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
As everybody else in the studio

3711
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Oh, hooray

3712
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Ranma, what's on your mind?

3713
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Not much, Rob

3714
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
I have a bone to pick with you

3715
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Oh god, what did I do now?

3716
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
I'm offended by how you pronounce people's names

3717
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Yeah, you know, I find it pretty offensive too

3718
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
That I can't learn to fucking read

3719
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Especially with all the languages

3720
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
In the world that people derive their names from

3721
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
I'm very offended that I just don't, like, fucking know

3722
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Because, you know, sometimes

3723
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
You read things one way in one language

3724
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
And they read another way in another

3725
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
And I'm offended by my lack of edumacation

3726
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
You know we love you, Rob, right?

3727
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Yeah, I know

3728
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Are you just trying to be a smartass about something?

3729
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Yes

3730
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
And what?

3731
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
But the whole little big plan is just

3732
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
It's ridiculous, that's all it is

3733
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
And why do you say ridiculous?

3734
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Everybody gets offended over something

3735
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
And the problem is, not enough people in this world

3736
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Is open-minded to realize it's nothing to be

3737
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
It's nothing that serious

3738
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
That's all it is

3739
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
I'm just saying, in a way, how Muslims are kind of being

3740
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Like, subjugated

3741
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
About what's going on in the news and the media

3742
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
So, of course, something like this they're gonna pick up on

3743
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
And they're gonna lose their minds about it

3744
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Is that really Sony's fault, though?

3745
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Because, you know, kind of like I was saying before

3746
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
If Sony doesn't do anything about this

3747
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
And then the mainstream media picks up on this

3748
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
I mean, it's gonna do a lot of damage

3749
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Whereas Sony's trying to put out a fire here

3750
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Before it gets too big

3751
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
But why should they?

3752
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
I mean, it's a normal song, big deal

3753
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Sadly, it's the world we live in

3754
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
And I'm not saying it's alright

3755
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
It's just, you know, it's what it is

3756
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Yeah

3757
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
What else is on your mind?

3758
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Have you been to any cons lately you wanna talk about?

3759
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Yes, I just got back from a convention

3760
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
About six, seven hours ago

3761
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
You are the con king

3762
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
What con did you go to this time?

3763
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I'm a con whore

3764
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I went to Zenkai Con

3765
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Where is Zenkai Con?

3766
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Valley Forge Convention Center

3767
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Valley Forge, Pennsylvania

3768
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
It's where Classic Gaming Expo was a few years ago

3769
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Ah, okay, so how was it?

3770
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Was there a lot of gaming stuff to be seen there?

3771
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Or was it mostly anime, or what?

3772
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
It was a mix of A and B

3773
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
But it wasn't that many video gaming cosplay

3774
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
But I will say the game room was nice

3775
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
It was...

3776
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
It was great

3777
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Did you get to play anything in the game room you hadn't played before?

3778
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,000
I pretty much, I played the new Bleach game for the Wii

3779
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
That one I had not played yet

3780
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
What'd you think?

3781
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
I thought it was pretty good

3782
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I liked the fact that to attack

3783
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
You actually shake the Wii mode to attack

3784
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
You attack in the game

3785
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Which is something I've never seen in a Wii game before, really

3786
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Yeah

3787
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
Never heard of that one

3788
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Well that's cool

3789
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
What do you think about anime games

3790
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
On gaming consoles in general

3791
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Because a lot of us kind of write them off as crap

3792
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Just like a lot of movie and TV show game translations

3793
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Are there anime games out there that seem to transcend this

3794
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Or are they just crap too?

3795
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
It depends

3796
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
I mean, when I got into Ranma 1.5

3797
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
And then the video game came out

3798
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I thought the game was good

3799
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
But looking back, I kind of hard battled

3800
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
The only one that came to the states

3801
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
That was a good one

3802
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
It didn't really follow the story line though

3803
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
It was good

3804
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Nowadays with a lot of anime games

3805
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
They're actually taking the story lines

3806
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
And putting it into the game

3807
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
If you notice how all the Dragon Ball Z games are

3808
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Even though they're rehashes

3809
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
But they're actually taking the story line

3810
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
And following along with this

3811
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Why there's like five different sequels to a game

3812
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
What system was this?

3813
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
I've never played the Ranma

3814
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I played a Ranma game on Super Nintendo

3815
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
That's the one

3816
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
There's also one on PC Engine

3817
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
There's an RPG on PC Engine

3818
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Which I've played a little bit of

3819
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
It's kind of hard

3820
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
On Playstation there was a Ranma 1.5 Battle Renaissance

3821
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Which I've got and it's kind of fun

3822
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Rice Princess is like Ranma

3823
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Because if you pour water on her she goes

3824
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Shut up

3825
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Did you play Battle Renaissance?

3826
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Yeah, I played it

3827
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
The engine was a little bit loose

3828
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
But it was still fun

3829
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I love actually kicking people's butts

3830
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
There you go

3831
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Yeah

3832
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Alright, well any other comments before we get some more calls?

3833
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
One thing

3834
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
You'll probably get a real kick out of

3835
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I'll have pictures uploaded soon

3836
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
We had a samba de amigo dance party

3837
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
At the convention Friday night

3838
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Oh dear good lord

3839
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
How exactly does one go to a samba de amigo dance party?

3840
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
You get

3841
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
You show up

3842
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
You grab the maracas

3843
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
You start playing

3844
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
You start freestyling and dancing

3845
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
First few minutes no one really showed up

3846
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But as the music started blasting

3847
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
We had a line going all the way down

3848
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
People just wanted to get up and have fun with it

3849
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
We were giving out little maracas

3850
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
As prizes

3851
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
We had sombrero hats giving them out to

3852
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
Where we could do the best funky dance ever

3853
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
You should put that on YouTube

3854
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Promptly

3855
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
If it's not up now it should be up by later this week

3856
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
And I will find images and links

3857
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
And I'll send it to you guys

3858
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Alright Rama we gotta let you go

3859
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
But have a good one buddy

3860
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
You too enjoy

3861
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

3862
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
If you want to give us a call

3863
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?

3864
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Hello OrangeLoungeRadio

3865
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Is he who seeks to replace

3866
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
The train wreck of the general masses

3867
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
With the train wreck of his own choosing

3868
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Hello

3869
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
R

3870
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Introduce yourself

3871
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Bob Adrian of Hydra

3872
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I know who you are

3873
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
But you have to introduce yourself to the listeners

3874
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
I'm Jason

3875
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Alright what's on your mind

3876
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Since we ever so briefly touched on it

3877
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I thought I'd add in a couple little comments

3878
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Since we didn't really go onto it

3879
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Two side notes before I do that

3880
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Jump Superstars while it wasn't really

3881
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
An anime game to the same extent

3882
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
You were talking about

3883
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
A good game, it was a very good fighter

3884
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Not one that I've really

3885
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I'm not much of a fighter person but I had a lot of fun with Jump Superstars

3886
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I played that a little bit and it is fun

3887
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
And the other side note

3888
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Has anybody even played

3889
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
The DR Universe series?

3890
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Yeah I have the first game

3891
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I don't have the second game

3892
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I have the first game and although quest mode

3893
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Was awful awful awful I like the song list

3894
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
And steps of what there was

3895
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
When I bought my

3896
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
Xbox I have quite a few

3897
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Other games as well but my initial reasoning

3898
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
For wanting to buy it was pretty much purely

3899
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
The UltraMix series

3900
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
And they were great

3901
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
And then E3 came around with the

3902
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Universe redone banners from

3903
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Boring hell

3904
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
And I've just never cared to play the

3905
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
Universe series at all

3906
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Yeah but past the banners it's kind of nice to have the game

3907
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
In high def and wide screen

3908
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
It's a neat little change for the game

3909
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
It probably is I don't doubt that

3910
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
But I mean UltraMix was never

3911
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
The most visually appealing game in the first place

3912
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
I don't think anybody is going to deny that

3913
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
It played really well past the first one

3914
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
But it never looked that way

3915
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Universe 2 was kind of just like Universe 1 from what I

3916
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Understood but Universe 3 is supposed

3917
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
To be a lot different so I'm

3918
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I'm curious I'll check it out probably

3919
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Funny all this from

3920
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
The Bimani series

3921
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
The Bimani show that was and

3922
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Is only a footnote now

3923
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Yeah well you know and a lot of shows

3924
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Still don't even talk about it at all and a lot of shows

3925
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Would just say oh it's another

3926
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
DDR game they're all the same and to some

3927
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Extent they're right but there are

3928
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
There are definitely those differences out there

3929
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Well now it's time to talk about it

3930
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
And in the process talk about me

3931
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Kind of, not really

3932
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
Funny story, have you guys heard of the

3933
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
There's a sim file that DMSura

3934
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Made quite a while ago called DeltaMax

3935
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
Ever heard of it?

3936
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Yes, vaguely, I know what DMSura

3937
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Is but I vaguely know

3938
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
The gimmick so to say about it

3939
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Isn't it that you hit all four notes

3940
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
At once or something?

3941
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
That's an old gimmick but that's okay

3942
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
I don't

3943
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
The gimmick is that it's a

3944
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
DMSura remix of the Max series

3945
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
And it starts at I think

3946
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
130 beats per minute

3947
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
And ends at 573

3948
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Is that the one, oh okay

3949
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Is it the one that rolls backwards because I remember that being

3950
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
A gimmick too, alright

3951
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Okay so it starts

3952
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
It's all progression, 130 to 573

3953
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
It's kind of like a

3954
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
BPM per measure

3955
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
But it speeds up

3956
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
The speed is not statically

3957
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Increasing, it is very variable, it goes with the

3958
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Tune, it's actually really cool

3959
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
There's a step mania cabinet

3960
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
That a friend of ours built into

3961
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
The DDR machine down in Colorado Springs

3962
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
That there's a tournament going on

3963
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
At next month, not that anybody

3964
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Hey if you're in the Colorado area come down to Mr. Big's

3965
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Next weekend rather, not next month

3966
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
There's going to be a lot of cool people there

3967
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Ding, that's my plug for the day

3968
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
So he has a step mania

3969
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Cab with all of the official DDR songs

3970
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
A ton of sim files, delta max

3971
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Being one of them and a couple of other little

3972
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Bonus extras like in the groove

3973
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
I was very very

3974
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Disappointed to hear that

3975
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Delta max in universe

3976
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
3 isn't going to have

3977
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
The sim created background

3978
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
Video, because if it

3979
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Did I could have claimed a

3980
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
My own little piece of assistance

3981
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Property in a DDR official game

3982
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Why did you do

3983
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Something with this?

3984
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
There's a person nicknamed

3985
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Tora that I

3986
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Believe he actually did all of the background work

3987
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
Basically, I don't even remember what the

3988
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Image background is, but he

3989
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Created a series of text of all of the beats per minute

3990
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
All the BPM numbers

3991
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
And they have this

3992
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Shaky fluid effect

3993
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
And he put the

3994
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Videos for that together amazingly

3995
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
But what I did was I wrote out a quick

3996
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Little script to actually put

3997
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
In the changes that he wanted to

3998
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
And again it goes up

3999
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
It was a pain in the ass

4000
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Too

4001
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Just the changes in the videos

4002
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
The fact that it's not just linear straight up

4003
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Calculating which measurement and time that it happens on

4004
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I barely even remember

4005
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
That was like 3 years ago

4006
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
But it was a very awesome video

4007
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
It was very simple

4008
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
But Konami came in and changed it all?

4009
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
They want to do their own thing probably

4010
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
It'll be flowers and sparkles

4011
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
No it's

4012
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Universe, it'll be spaceships

4013
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
And Uranus

4014
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
On that note

4015
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
It'll be a lot of

4016
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Delta triangles flying over the screen

4017
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Because you know, Delta and

4018
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Triangles

4019
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Oh my god, trigonometry, no!

4020
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Well sorry to hear you just missed your chance

4021
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
For remote video game stardom

4022
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Hey you have OLR stardom

4023
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
Any other things you want to say

4024
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Real quick before we move on?

4025
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
No I think that was my excuse

4026
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
For calling in tonight

4027
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Well Jason take care, thanks for your comments

4028
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Alright guys

4029
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
We'll take one more call

4030
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
1877 game OLR, username on skype

4031
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call

4032
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
And then we have some last minute stories to do

4033
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Before we get on out of here, hey live listeners

4034
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
You'll want to stay tuned tonight

4035
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Past the show, we have a little treat for you guys

4036
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
We'll get into that in a little while

4037
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Be sure to join us next week for episode 300

4038
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Do you think though that they might have

4039
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Lasted a lot of sales chance because a lot of the

4040
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
People that would have been interested in this are just going to go to

4041
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
The fan translation? I guess let me rephrase

4042
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
How many of the people that end up playing the fan

4043
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Translation do you think would turn around and buy something official

4044
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
From Nintendo?

4045
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
That's a good question

4046
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
I myself would buy the official thing

4047
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
If it were to come out

4048
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
In fact the translators encourage

4049
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Buying the official

4050
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Merchandise and stuff

4051
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
But as far as the

4052
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Nintendo side of things I just hope that

4053
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
If they

4054
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Decide to do something like sue the translators

4055
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Or something like that

4056
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
It means that

4057
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
That they're working on an official translation

4058
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
That they're not just going to leave it

4059
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Dead. You know I think a lot of people

4060
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Are like you and you know if they're real true

4061
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Fans of the series they would buy an official

4062
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Translation anyway but do you think there's some people

4063
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
That would feel so slighted that once they play

4064
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Through the translation they're just going to be like

4065
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Yeah screw the real one

4066
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Yeah that's a good

4067
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
That's a good point

4068
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Kind of like when I

4069
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Like I used to download

4070
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
A lot of like money songs

4071
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
They're like buying it and stuff

4072
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Nah screw buying the real thing

4073
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
I'll just keep it

4074
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Especially with the import stuff

4075
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Well I guess we will see

4076
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I'm very curious to see if it does

4077
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Catch the attention of people in Nintendo

4078
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I'm waiting for the cease and desist myself

4079
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight

4080
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Yeah

4081
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Sky you're in Milpitas Golf Land

4082
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Damn we need to come down to Sunnyville Golf Land again

4083
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Um you know I know I knew

4084
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
I was in the area just it worked out

4085
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
So that we were at Milpitas and I didn't make it over there

4086
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
But I'll get to Sunnyville at some point

4087
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
I'm sure

4088
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Yeah maybe the NorCal division of the

4089
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
All-Armor can meet up there

4090
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
We'll see we'll see you know um

4091
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
With the surgery coming up and everything it won't be anytime soon

4092
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
But who knows maybe by the end of the year

4093
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Yeah I was saying

4094
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
We're going to Svega Lailies

4095
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
For Popin' 16

4096
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Oh hey I like popin' music

4097
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
It's certainly better than beatin' groovy

4098
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
Yeah I've gotten back into it recently

4099
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Yeah

4100
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I might get a job

4101
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
Like I'm possibly getting a job

4102
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Where in the winter I might use the money to get a desktop arcade

4103
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
So I can play the real thing at home

4104
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Instead of frickin' 9 key 2DX

4105
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Good times good times

4106
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I wish I

4107
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I wish I had that kind of disposable income

4108
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
But then again I'm looking at my new iPhone

4109
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
When I'm saying that

4110
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
We all have priorities

4111
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Alright GS6 here we gotta let you go

4112
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
But have a good one buddy

4113
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Alright bye bye

4114
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
You know Dekeman in chat has a good point

4115
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
He says they've had two years to give them a cease and desist

4116
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Sometimes it's not until you start getting noticed

4117
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Like hello in the groove

4118
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Remember that?

4119
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Nobody cared until they tried to put out a home version of the game

4120
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Alright anyway

4121
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Last minute stories

4122
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
DarkSoccer anything for us tonight for last minute stories?

4123
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Yeah

4124
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
What?

4125
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Fire

4126
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Loki you always have something for last minute stories

4127
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Yeah a few more things real quick

4128
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
We know that Guitar Hero they're talking about

4129
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Making god knows how many games next year

4130
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Well there's yet another one that's been

4131
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Discovered

4132
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
A trademark has recently been placed

4133
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
For the title

4134
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Guitar Hero Modern Hits

4135
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:43,000
And no word on exactly what that is

4136
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Of course the term hit is relative

4137
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Exactly

4138
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Who knows

4139
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
If I were to take a guess I think it's another DS version

4140
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
It sounds like a DS version to me

4141
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
That's a good point

4142
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
It's pretty vague

4143
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Alright

4144
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to

4145
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Xbox Live Marketplace

4146
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
As an Xbox original

4147
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Starting well actually

4148
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
This Monday October 20th

4149
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
So you'll be able to download the full game

4150
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
For $15 or

4151
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
1200 Microsoft Points

4152
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
So that's pretty cool

4153
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
Also

4154
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Fable 2

4155
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
You should definitely go to

4156
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Microsoft's website

4157
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
They have a special website made for Fable 2

4158
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Xbox.com

4159
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
I believe you just go to the Fable 2 page

4160
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
They have a little game that you can play

4161
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
Including Chicken Kickin

4162
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
You can actually win prizes

4163
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
For your in-game character

4164
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
So you can win gold and different prizes

4165
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
In Fable 2

4166
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Playing this Flash game

4167
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Which I think is pretty cool and hasn't been done before

4168
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
So hopefully you see some more

4169
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Website integration with different games

4170
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
If it's not another week

4171
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
With another movie announcement

4172
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Based on a game

4173
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Well Grant Morrison is now

4174
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Doing the Area 51 game

4175
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
You know what though? Max Payne was number one

4176
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
At the box office this week beating that very

4177
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Hyped W movie

4178
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
So there's money to be made

4179
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Yeah

4180
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
So interesting

4181
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Area 51 the movie

4182
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Hopefully it's cheesy and motion captured

4183
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Then there's

4184
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Going to be some new download content for Mega Man

4185
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
9 coming soon including a brand new

4186
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Bonus level with a bonus boss

4187
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Fake Man

4188
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
And you'll be able to purchase

4189
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
That for 100 Wii

4190
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Points

4191
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Will it not be impossibly hard?

4192
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Probably not

4193
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
But it's a brand new special stage

4194
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Oh my god I can't play that game

4195
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
And lastly to kind of talk a little bit about

4196
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Another game that

4197
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
We'll be seeing a little bit more pretty soon

4198
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Little Big Planet

4199
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
They actually have some more videos from the beta

4200
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Someone has actually recreated some of the levels

4201
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
From Mirror's Edge

4202
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
In this game

4203
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
So you can actually play some of the Mirror's Edge

4204
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
In the beta and of course the full game

4205
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
When it comes out because all those levels are

4206
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Being transferred over which is pretty

4207
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Freaking awesome

4208
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
And that's it

4209
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
Well that's going to do it for tonight's episode of

4210
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Orange Lounge Radio but before we

4211
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Finish the show tonight we got to go around and get everybody's

4212
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Final thought

4213
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Fart Princess thank you for coming to the show

4214
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
When you did and everything

4215
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Do you have a final thought for us?

4216
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Even though you were late

4217
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Vote no on Poop 8

4218
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
The Doctor

4219
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Do you have any final thoughts?

4220
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Don't vote for McCain

4221
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
He's crazy

4222
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
We're getting a little political tonight

4223
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Loki do you have

4224
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
A final thought?

4225
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
My costume

4226
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Is freaking awesome

4227
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
And you may see it next week

4228
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Is it Tingle?

4229
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
It's a video game character

4230
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Okay

4231
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
My final thought is

4232
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Mentos

4233
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Fresh and full of life

4234
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Darsakha your final thought?

4235
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I fucking love Ichiban Khan

4236
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Ichiban Khan

4237
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
USA.com

4238
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I shop there every time I'm in San Francisco

4239
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Sounds good

4240
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Alright next week episode

4241
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
300 of Orange Lounge Radio

4242
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
What guests and surprises await the crew?

4243
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
What messages

4244
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Will you guys leave for us on our skype line

4245
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
When we're not live?

4246
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
Will it potentially be a fuck show?

4247
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Who knows all that to be determined

4248
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
In one weeks time

4249
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Come back for episode 300

4250
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio next week

4251
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Hey if you enjoyed what you heard tonight

4252
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Tell two friends about the show

4253
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
That's how we spread the word

4254
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
And if you don't have any friends

4255
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Just kidding even if you do

4256
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Buy them

4257
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
You should post a review on our iTunes

4258
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
On the store and I'll post the link in chat

4259
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
And leave us a nice 5 star review

4260
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
Yes every little bit helps

4261
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
The more listeners we have the better

4262
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Because it's not about awards

4263
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
It's about listeners

4264
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
About you guys that show up every week

4265
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
So thank you guys so much

4266
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Have a good one we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio

4267
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000

4274
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
On Orange Lounge Radio

4275
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Do not necessarily reflect

4276
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
Those of the entire staff

4277
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio or allgames.com

4278
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
But we're probably right anyway

4279
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:49,000
See you next week!
