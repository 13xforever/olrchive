32267	32407	What?
32447	32567	What?
63273	65314	As if we weren't running late already.
67675	68215	Here we go.
68295	69255	Let's try that again.
69376	70016	From the top.
70156	70736	Take two.
71477	74438	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
90705	98259	Nintendo introduces their winner lineup in a new DS, ACDC comes to Rockband in a Walmart expansion disc,
106343	106963	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers Hi
136585	136925	How you doing?
136986	137906	I'm here.
138287	139067	Alright, she's here.
139488	140008	She's kicking.
140909	141649	She's feisty.
142390	145092	Hopefully we'll hear some feisty snark a little later.
145112	145512	No, I don't know.
145532	146193	I'm just talking you up.
146633	148955	I'll also say, actually kind of boring tonight in reality.
149035	149816	See, there's feisty.
149836	149956	What?
155580	156260	I knew you had it in you.
156741	159322	All right, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
159562	160083	Hello.
160163	160823	How you doing, Loki?
161043	161243	Good.
161764	162084	All right.
162244	163505	Are you feeling feisty tonight?
164565	166026	No, I'm starting to get a hang, though.
166146	166907	Oh, I'm sorry.
167067	167887	Is it something in the air?
168027	168768	Is it what you ate?
169488	171570	It's probably allergies or an X-strain.
171970	172450	That's too bad.
172550	173731	That's usually the one of the two.
174011	174731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
197915	199037	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

235944	240066	My gaming week was a lot of Ragnarok, as usual.
240306	240566	Addict.
241366	242107	Hey.
242127	244327	Okay, Mr. World of Warcraft.
244347	246848	Hey, when was the last time I said on this show I played World of Warcraft?
246948	248069	When's the last time you actually did?
249149	249489	Today.
249790	250250	Okay.
252190	252911	But wait a minute.
253091	253751	Wait a minute.
254111	256292	Yesterday was the first time in like three weeks.
256572	257212	So give me a break.
257292	258533	I also watched game shows.
259293	259793	Awesome.
259913	260894	Namely the VP debate.
262834	263995	Who wants to be a vice president?
264301	265242	Yeah, I don't know.
265362	274509	I actually, I won't get into it, but I actually was moderately disappointed in one party and moderately impressed by the other party, even though I thought they both were kind of...
275228	283175	I will say this, we like to keep our eyes on gaming blogs around the internet and the things they're reporting and of course I'm sure you guys have heard about Kotaku.
283855	286197	They just ran a story that's towards the top of their feed.
286217	288099	It looks like it got pushed at 5 o'clock today.
288759	290741	Sarah Palin in video games.
291281	294444	And if you haven't seen this article, I'm going to link it to you guys here in chat.
294864	295285	And you know,
295825	307029	Democrat, Republican, Independent, I don't care who you are, you've probably seen the jokes about Sarah Palin, and hopefully no matter where you stand, you have a sense of humor about it.
307269	313632	Look at this, they put her face on all these different famous video game shots, like there's Tomb Raider, Sarah.
314532	315753	and here's Metroid.
316333	317393	Sarah is Samus.
317414	318574	The Metroid one actually looks cool.
318834	319354	And Cortana.
319374	320595	Yeah, actually they're not bad.
320655	322336	The Photoshop jobs are actually pretty good.
322816	326778	I gotta say my favorite one though is, you know that one, Move Every Zig right there.
328039	329339	God, what the hell was that game?
329739	330760	Oh, your base or belong to us.
331280	331760	Zero Wing.
331780	332321	Zero Wing, yeah.
332341	332541	Thank you.
334028	335009	Oh my god, that's great.
335169	335649	Very nice.
337030	338351	I like Alaskan Avengers.
339592	340253	So you can check that out.
340293	343975	It looks like it's on Kotaku, but I think it originally comes from a site called Pwn or Die.
344856	345336	Something like that.
346197	346697	There you have it.
347458	348358	Get your politics on.
348398	350360	Hey, no matter where you are, though, just vote.
350680	351240	Freaking vote in November.
351280	353262	It looks like someone's cosplay photo, the same as one.
353669	354830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
379042	379282	Rock Band
407128	408749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
426798	429342	I'm working on an objects in space project and I'm doing a pinball machine.
442419	442519	Oh.
442860	443861	For my art class.
443921	444761	My teacher thought it was a cool idea.
444781	446763	Are you going to take pictures and blog it?
447104	448285	Actually, I'm going to... Put it on your Twitter?
448485	449946	I'm going to make prints of it.
450307	450827	Oh, okay.
451067	455031	If it doesn't turn out like utter crap like I feel it will, but... We still have the space.
455091	456973	I've been too lazy on JustinTV.
457013	460916	I'm pointing to the space where I kept saying I was going to get the GameStop whiteboard.
461617	462418	What was it?
462458	464359	Things that suck about GameStop or something like that we were going to do?
465240	468103	And we still have the space, so we could have a picture of it.
468243	474466	My husband's told me in no uncertain terms that I have to have it preserved forever.
474626	486012	So I figured, because I was going to do something for a pinball room, so I figured I could do it for the pinball room, get a grade for it, and maybe people might like it.
486192	486592	I don't know.
486912	487292	There you go.
487512	487992	They just might.
489141	490502	Game Week was alright.
490522	493245	I played, of course, Saints Row, the first one, quite a bit because live's been fucked up.
507898	508939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
534535	538138	Any chance of an Earth Defense Force 2018 someday?
538918	539259	No.
541521	542942	Let's see, what else did I play?
543102	546185	Oh, I also played Mercenaries 2 some more.
546765	549027	Did another co-op session with my friend.
549548	550148	That was pretty fun.
552298	555519	And then of course, the big one I've been playing this week, Saints Row 2.
556259	557960	Oh my god, this game is awesome.
559240	572024	Seriously, if you're going to compare Saints Row 2 to Grand Theft Auto 4, I think the real thing that kind of stands out is this game is a lot more fun, I guess.
572664	572824	It's...
574191	578872	Right from the get-go, very over-the-top, very just fun to play.
579452	580793	So it's campy fun?
581253	590795	It is kind of campy fun, but I'm playing right now through one of the gang missions, through the Brotherhood, which is one of the three, well, technically four gangs in the game.
591676	595016	And it just keeps getting more fucked up as you play it.
595096	597217	I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but...
598502	600904	They kind of are getting back at each other.
601044	608592	One does something to the other group and in return they retaliate with something even more harsh.
609532	610233	It's getting nuts.
611983	617447	But the game, it's got a lot of really good radio stations on the actual vehicles and stuff.
617787	619048	They have a lot of good licensed music.
619088	621069	In fact, their 80s station is fucking awesome.
621429	625092	Did you say something on your Twitter about crashing while you were listening to some song?
625112	633177	No, no, we were flying in a biplane, buzzing over a freeway, shooting at cars while listening to Land From Down Under.
633197	635159	I mean, that's just...
636059	637100	It's just so crazy.
637580	640081	And there's a lot that catches you off guard.
640121	645584	There's a mission that there is a direct reference to Jack Thompson in.
647418	649319	Just a lot of really fun stuff.
649459	653260	And, I mean, this game has literally made me forget about Grand Theft Auto 4.
653380	654560	It's that good.
654981	660903	Now, first I must say, though, the graphics in the game, they are a step up from the first game.
661843	668605	The glitches, there are still some glitches in this game, and some pretty bad ones at times.
668665	674347	Like, there'll be nothing that really stops the game from working, just kind of like, huh.
674467	675968	Here's Loki playing Saints Row 2.
678769	679469	I'll kill you!
680109	681090	I'll kill you all!
681110	682330	You're gonna die!
700399	701699	So yeah, going back to the glitches.
701719	702620	This is why we have a chat room.
702640	716064	There was one time where I had blown up a bunch of stuff during a Mayhem mission, and when I came back after the mission was done, the park benches hadn't respawned, but people were still sitting down like there was benches there.
716924	727447	There was another one where I was watching a cutscene with some vehicles or whatever in a caravan, and each one of the vehicles in the caravan ran into a telephone pole that was on the corner because they were...
728387	731910	It's like the AI is sort of off a little bit, like in their paths.
732211	734573	It's just like off slightly.
734913	741258	Like there'll be another move you can do with a samurai sword where you can literally stab someone up through their throat, but it's too high.
741558	744521	So you're stabbing above them and it just reacts.
744561	745442	Like up the nose?
746042	747143	No, like above their head.
747443	751266	It just acts like you're reacting to hitting them, but it's not quite right.
751306	752908	And this is the release version?
752928	753088	Yeah.
753228	754968	Yes, but here's the thing.
756029	756869	It doesn't matter, though.
757049	761250	It's still early awesome, and they have chainsaw kills just like Gears of War.
762531	770093	It sounds like it's not going to be graphically the greatest game ever or the sound or whatever, but it's just for you, it's just fun.
770173	772333	It's big, dumb, stupid, blow shit up fun.
772533	772833	It is.
772973	774354	It's like blow shit up the game.
774534	775834	That's pretty much what it is.
775874	776574	That's what you've always wanted.
776594	777014	Something like that.
777074	781996	But yeah, that's pretty much what... If you're looking for a game that's supposed to be cutting edge and stuff...
782936	783636	Lightening Lightening
810946	814670	I'm not touching Saints Row 2 until I finish 1, lol
827990	829931	Redertainment in chat says, thank god for patches.
829951	831211	How is the developer with patches?
852441	854482	Um, pretty good, I guess.
854622	859824	I mean, last game they only did one patch on it, so it didn't really fix a lot of the glitches in it.
859844	862724	And there are still some glitches from the first game that you can do in this one.
862764	872148	Like, for example, if you hop on top of a car and you hit the Y button to get in, you'll just instantly teleport inside the car, just like you could in the first game.
873088	873128	Um...
874241	874782	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
894459	915227	and um they have a whole the customization of the characters is just insane they've added so many different sliders I literally spent 40 minutes in this game um setting up my character to look like me so you know it's so elaborate with like actually taking pictures of my face and trying to get the proportions correct I don't know we'll see if it looks correct when uh we we actually show it off but uh
916833	920957	You can make some really fucked up looking characters in this game though, seriously.
921538	925261	And it's funny because they always comment to you, they're like, did you do something with your hair?
925962	928284	That's their comment because you can be a totally different gender.
928925	933309	But they have three different voices for male and female that you can pick from.
933329	933969	You can pick your...
935865	963330	your stance, they have a taunt and they also have kind of like a compliment little gesture you can do they have everything for doing the little jig that what's her name did and to like Michael Jackson stuff I have my guy kind of doing the A for happy days and then my taunt is just flipping someone the bird that's funny nice
963837	970515	but yeah, lots of customization, really fun game seriously you gotta check it out alright
971671	973392	I've been playing some new games this week as well.
973452	975333	I've been playing the old standbys as well.
975673	977874	World of Warcraft, as I mentioned DarkSakura earlier.
978134	981615	Just squeezing some more in before the new Wrath of the Lich King comes out.
981875	983916	Which, by the way, I'm thinking I'm going to buy at 7-Eleven.
984136	987858	I was at 7-Eleven randomly because I was craving a Slurpee at like 2 o'clock in the morning.
988298	991360	And they have a big old ad there for reserving games.
991760	996682	Like Wrath of the Lich King and all these other... What else was coming out that they were pushing?
997342	1000787	and other sports games that were coming out and all this stuff.
1001087	1003470	And I'm thinking, who's going to buy their freaking games at 7-Eleven?
1003510	1005092	There's going to be nobody there the night it launches.
1005112	1006934	So I think that might be where I go to get it.
1006974	1007335	We'll see.
1008096	1012321	But also, there's a big, big content patch coming to Warcraft on Tuesday and it's going to change everything.
1012341	1012922	It's like the pre-
1013422	1014182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1039755	1040877	Thank you for watching!
1047361	1048381	New games I've been playing this week.
1048441	1053243	Mega Man 9 finally came out on the Xbox 360, so I decided to pick it up because I wasn't going to get it on the Wii because I don't have the space.
1053883	1059225	And then on PlayStation 3, I don't even have yet because LittleBigPlanet's not out, so I probably won't crack until next week and get a PlayStation 3.
1060105	1062606	But I did finally get Mega Man 9 on Xbox 360.
1063086	1066787	It's fun, it's hard, it's retro, it's probably everything you've heard about.
1067107	1069888	Although I will say this, the controls were not as bad as I was expecting.
1070048	1072469	I thought the controls were going to be horrific on the Xbox 360.
1072849	1073850	It actually isn't that bad.
1073890	1075070	I'm actually able to use...
1075470	1076151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1093888	1094489	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1114511	1118453	Splash Woman stage, I probably played that like 25 times and died many, many times.
1118833	1122535	But now I can get through it without dying because it's just about memorizing where you jump when.
1122575	1123636	That's what it is.
1123796	1125077	It's all pattern memorization.
1125337	1125617	That's it.
1127038	1127618	Ranma says, Wow.
1127638	1128278	I don't know about that.
1128338	1129799	I think that's more of a res application actually.
1140401	1140881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1161727	1162127	DarkSakura.com
1188823	1189904	And it's just scary.
1190384	1193205	You know, you got the ambient music playing.
1193225	1195587	This is actually a track from Silent Hill 3, not the new game, but that's alright.
1196007	1200649	You know, and I'm just walking around and everything's all dark and scary.
1200809	1205011	And I'll tell you what, this game totally relies on cheap thrills.
1205492	1211135	You know, like I'll be walking around and exploring, trying to find the other half of the x-ray so I can solve that first little puzzle.
1211535	1212835	And then, BAM!
1212895	1216998	A wheelchair falls down from the staircase and scares the fucking shit out of me.
1218078	1219219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1235535	1241881	The graphics aren't quite as good as I would have expected for a next generation Silent Hill game, but it's by no means bad.
1242221	1246625	It's probably on par with the last generation of games, but just a widescreen and a little bit crisper.
1247947	1251149	TigerClaw asks, when I saw Pyramid Head, was I scared and screaming with joy?
1251430	1261219	Here's the thing, I didn't get far enough because that night, seriously, after the wheelchair fell down the staircase, and my, no, I'm not even kidding with you, my front door blew open right after that happened.
1262039	1264661	I was like, fuck this, I can't play this game right now.
1265101	1266021	So I turned it off.
1266561	1267602	I tried playing a little more.
1267642	1269603	I played for about another 90 minutes the next day.
1269983	1272224	And I noticed there was a distinct lack of save points.
1272604	1275346	But I got through the first little area and got to another one.
1275366	1276666	But I haven't gotten to Pyramid Head yet.
1278947	1280448	That tells you I'm not that far in the game at all.
1280488	1284210	So I can't give a full review to this game because I haven't really seen enough of it.
1284510	1287972	But I definitely can already tell it's worthy of being a Silent Hill game.
1287992	1290653	And if you like cheap scares, you'll enjoy it.
1292553	1295335	HendersonMan in chat says, Silent Hill looks better than that Siren crap.
1295956	1296877	I couldn't get into Siren.
1298758	1306064	I will say, though, in the very, very beginning of the game is one of those places where it starts to turn from day to night.
1306184	1308846	You know, good Silent Hill, Dark Silent Hill, or whatever you want to call it.
1309246	1310087	And that's creepy.
1310547	1311468	It is very creepy.
1311788	1312889	But it's pretty much the same.
1312989	1313750	It's a cinematic.
1313810	1315831	It's not really something that happens live as is going on.
1315851	1316152	Anyway.
1316812	1319834	Henderson Man does confirm that the save points are few and far between.
1320295	1323878	So, when you see a save point in Silent Hill, cherish it.
1324158	1331924	Although, from what I understand, the game does kind of auto-save as you go, so that if you do die, you don't have to go all the way back to your last save point.
1332324	1333725	But if you turn it off, you do.
1334026	1335727	So, there you go.
1335787	1337308	I'm having fun with Silent Hill Homecoming.
1337348	1338469	I will play more of it this week.
1339190	1340591	Maybe not when I'm home by myself, though.
1340891	1341812	Because it's a little bit scary.
1341832	1343053	A little bit scary.
1343892	1344973	Thanks for watching!
1359966	1364728	Don't forget to check us out on LiveJournal at username OrangeLounge or our Facebook, the OL Army.
1364748	1369829	Just search for OL Army under groups or our MySpace at username OrangeLoungeRadio or the Twitter at OLR.
1370149	1374131	Yes, that's four different social networking sites and four different names that we have on each of them.
1374511	1377792	We have a real problem with consistency here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1378712	1381413	All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1383234	1385295	Part A tonight is almost all Nintendo news.
1385395	1386115	I don't know what it is.
1386275	1389477	Maybe it's that little press conference they had just dominated the news this week.
1389837	1391078	Tons and tons of Nintendo news.
1391098	1392538	So that's where we're going to start tonight.
1392578	1392938	Right, Loki?
1393159	1393339	Yes.
1394039	1400382	And of course, the big news coming out of Nintendo's press conference was that they're announcing the brand new revision for the DS.
1401462	1401642	DSi
1417083	1419385	Also, the system has two cameras on it.
1419786	1428293	A 0.3 megapixel camera, which will be facing the user, kind of in between the one touch screen and the other screen there.
1429254	1433297	Also, there is a 1.3 megapixel camera on the outside.
1434118	1435819	The screens are slightly larger now.
1435859	1436420	They're 3.25 inches wide.
1438321	1446030	and you can also sync your photos with the Wii Photo Channel and also it will include a free web browser application built inside as well.
1447191	1450855	Also, just like the rumor said, you can play back your music on there.
1451495	1452316	It will be using AAC...
1455399	1456821	and DarkSakura.
1477785	1479867	Not getting it for a while, unfortunately.
1481508	1482288	Why, because they hate us?
1482809	1483869	Yes, because they hate us.
1483889	1487192	And because they say that the DS is selling so well over here.
1487892	1492596	Not anymore, now that you announced a brand new version that will be coming out next year, stupid.
1493416	1493817	God.
1496317	1504860	And also, the other big thing about it is there will be a new DSi shop where you'll be able to download games, kind of like WiiWare, but for the DS.
1506040	1509501	Some of the games range from free to about 800 points.
1511633	1512854	Kind of cool.
1513314	1522619	You're obviously the homebrew fan on this show, and Tigerclaw in chat says the DS homebrew community are going to pretty much find ways to hack the DSi since they can use the SD cards to do all sorts of things.
1522859	1523139	True?
1523199	1523480	False?
1523720	1524500	Yes, definitely.
1524800	1529883	And, you know, the memory card thing will definitely help.
1530363	1532705	Also, the fact that there's cameras built into it.
1534265	1537027	I'm assuming there's going to be a little bit more RAM built into it as well.
1537968	1538288	It just...
1539292	1553161	it's not going to be that hard especially since it has to play all the other DS cartridges so at the very least it will still work the way the DS does as far as homebrew stuff goes so does this mean you're going to kind of want one?
1554076	1562339	Yeah, the thing, though, that you have to understand, though, with this one, and I thought that they had onboard storage as well, like a little bit of onboard storage.
1563239	1569981	I could be wrong, though, is that this one will probably be able to receive some sort of firmware updates, whereas the other ones weren't.
1570241	1570581	I don't know.
1572482	1574503	What if this didn't have the SD card slot on it?
1574543	1577684	Would you still be as interested, or would it be not interested because there's no way to hack it?
1578004	1578904	No, I'd still be interested.
1579204	1579384	Really?
1579664	1580665	Yeah, you could still hack it.
1580705	1581185	I mean, you just...
1582469	1583571	Do it the way you're doing it now.
1598112	1602915	So I'm kind of wondering what other features they're going to have on there or how they're going to utilize different things.
1603815	1611060	I guess we have a lot of time, so we'll get to see what comes out in Japan first, I guess.
1611160	1612280	Comments from chat room.
1612921	1615883	Seg says, about the web browser, it's roundabout free.
1616023	1622987	Each DSi will get 500 Nintendo points, known as Wii points formerly, which can be used to buy the 500 point opera browser on the DSi.
1623007	1625488	I heard about that whole 500 free points thing they were supposed to be doing.
1625508	1626329	Yeah.
1627820	1630663	I think that the web browser is just free anyways.
1630783	1635769	It's kind of like how it was when it came out over here, where it's free for a while and now they charge for it.
1636429	1637330	I like this comment too.
1637350	1637971	I want to read this.
1638011	1640754	TheRobD in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, says, Yay.
1649864	1651606	I have to admit, I kind of agree.
1651846	1653889	I'm not that excited about this little device.
1653949	1659436	In fact, I've been jokingly calling it the DSiPhone because that's pretty much what it is but without the phone.
1659936	1661378	It's kind of like an iTouch.
1661518	1666204	So it's a DSiPhone, no, iPod Lite or Touch or whatever?
1666224	1668287	An iTouch, yeah, DSiTouch or whatever you want to call it.
1669088	1683686	In my mind, that's kind of what they're trying to do with this whole download store thing is that it's kind of trying to mirror that applications thing that the iTouch or the iPhone does, which I don't think they're trying to copy or anything because this thing's probably been in development for a long, long time.
1683766	1684928	But I don't know.
1685348	1685989	I can't –
1686730	1687310	Here's the thing.
1687650	1689732	I think I'm going to have to get one anyway.
1690272	1695334	Because you know there's going to be that game that comes out at some point where you have to use the camera.
1695554	1697035	Nintendo just freaking does this.
1697055	1698796	There'll be some Mario game I'm going to want to get.
1699016	1704299	If this is as secure as the Wii was with their virtual console and their...
1706770	1712378	WeWear Games I don't think we'll have to worry about spending money on the application store.
1712438	1713699	Well, but hold on though.
1713759	1715081	I mean, you know, come on.
1715802	1722350	I don't like to do that unless it's usually like import stuff or things you can't get here because, you know, I like to support stuff that's good.
1722811	1723432	But, you know...
1723812	1727854	No, I'm wondering though if they haven't announced yet anything about the virtual console stuff.
1727894	1732116	I'm wondering if some virtual console games will be compatible with this because that would be kind of cool.
1732476	1732836	You know what?
1732936	1738799	That alone would actually make me seriously consider getting one because that would really justify all those purchases I've been making.
1738819	1739419	That would be awesome.
1739439	1748043	Yeah, because can you imagine download to your SD memory card slot or whatever for like maybe stop it at like Super Nintendo games or something like that.
1748243	1754586	I've gotten to the point where I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo because I'm like, well, yeah, that would be cool, but they're not going to do it.
1755587	1759228	There'll be an adapter that you're going to have to pay $40 for that'll do it.
1760629	1764591	I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo just based on history at this point.
1764991	1767312	So I don't get excited about these types of things anymore.
1767552	1768133	It's kind of sad.
1769393	1772015	TigerClaw says, DSi also opens a new can of worms.
1772075	1775257	People will be sharing very inappropriate photos with each other via PictoChat.
1775578	1775938	Oh, great.
1776198	1785525	So if I go into the Penny Arcade Expo room at next year's PAX 09 and DSi or whatever, am I going to get cock shots all over my DS from people putting it down their pants and taking a picture?
1787066	1787446	Maybe.
1788687	1789107	Hooray.
1790448	1791309	But... What?
1792009	1793270	You might get boob shots, too.
1793470	1793890	I might.
1794691	1795391	I wouldn't mind that.
1795632	1795972	Ha ha ha!
1797563	1814698	Alright, if you want to chat on this, chat.orange.com Other things that were announced at Nintendo's press conference, speaking of SD cards, finally, and you know this has been a big thing for me lately, I've bitched and bitched and bitched and belly ached and cried and been a big baby about the fact that I do not believe I should have to
1815078	1819281	Remove my games from the Wii to put them on a card and then bring them back.
1819321	1821182	You know, this whole slow process.
1821502	1825504	I think they just should address the stupid onboard storage problem on the Wii.
1825824	1827085	And they finally have.
1827566	1831888	You will finally be able to load channels directly from the SD cards in spring of 2009.
1832969	1834350	The biggest duh in the world.
1834390	1837211	The thing that we knew should have been there the whole freaking time.
1837611	1839152	Finally they are installing in spring of 2009.
1839192	1841494	Why is it taking until spring 2009?
1841894	1843135	Why can't they do it now?
1843155	1843435	I mean...
1843675	1846196	I think they honestly didn't program it in to begin with.
1846257	1852420	I think they're trying to close up homebrew loops with this too.
1852600	1853681	I bet you that's what they're trying to do.
1854061	1857843	When they release this patch, they're going to do their damnedest to stop the exploiting.
1857863	1863306	They're not going to stop it, but I guess they feel they have an obligation to all the people that developed for their system to try.
1864827	1865747	Good luck with that.
1866148	1869830	Maybe you should talk to Sony and see how well that went with them and the PSP.
1871804	1874225	Don't you think they owe it to their developers to try?
1874765	1888390	Yeah, they owe it to their developers to try, but I don't think it's really hurting them right now as far as it's not allowing... Well, I guess it could allow piracy, but so far the community has been good about keeping that out.
1889210	1895973	And they do have a thing to load ISOs off of the memory cards or whatever, but it doesn't work really well.
1896693	1898253	Here's why the update's taking forever.
1898754	1903675	They don't want you to copy stuff on your SD card, take it to your friend's house, and put it on their Wii.
1904135	1908016	So they're having to come up with the whole, how are we going to get around this copy thing?
1908396	1909277	DRM, basically.
1909577	1910937	They're implementing DRM.
1910977	1912998	That's part of the testing, pushing this thing back.
1913018	1914778	They already have DRM implemented.
1915999	1920960	Because if you move channels... They're Nintendo.
1921000	1922840	It takes them fucking forever to do something.
1922880	1923481	There, that's it.
1923501	1924481	We'll just leave it at that.
1925669	1928431	They're also the masters of making us buy new things.
1928732	1929312	But guess what?
1929773	1931374	To be fair, this is a free update.
1931554	1937599	It's not something that's going to cost us any money, except for the fact that Nintendo-branded SD cards are always $10 more than the other ones.
1938100	1939121	Well, then don't buy them.
1939341	1939881	I know, don't.
1940101	1947408	Well, here's the other thing that you're going to have a problem with, too, is they haven't announced that they're going to expand the number of channels you can have, so you're still fucked.
1947428	1948909	You're going to run out of channels eventually.
1948969	1949369	Well...
1950350	1951911	But maybe that's just kind of a given.
1952031	1953573	I'm not going to hold that against them yet.
1955174	1956555	And that is a lot of space.
1956715	1959837	Or maybe the thing's smart enough to fill in with more channels.
1959877	1960158	I don't know.
1960178	1961679	Has anybody ever filled the damn thing up?
1961759	1962740	I imagine it's possible.
1963060	1964281	If you download nothing but Nintendo games.
1964341	1964861	And what happens?
1964901	1965582	You just can't put it anymore?
1965602	1966142	You can't put it anymore.
1966362	1967143	Wow, that sucks.
1968684	1968884	Huh.
1969285	1969625	Patch!
1970425	1971366	Alright.
1971706	1973848	It might be a part of this patch that you'll add new channels.
1973948	1975589	I'm not getting negative about that yet.
1975649	1976150	But we'll see.
1976470	1976930	More to come in 2009.
1978715	1984442	As far as other things that are going to be coming out for the Wii, the Wii Speak channel was unveiled.
1984462	1991731	Wii Speak is the microphone peripheral that's coming with Animal Crossing and is getting its own channel.
1991991	1997718	And that's about all that we know right now, that it's just Wii Speak.
1999469	2003071	So it's going to get its own channel though, so it's not something you're going to have to use Animal Crossing for.
2003091	2009736	I would assume, but there's no true details yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.
2010316	2015699	I'm actually thinking that something like that would work for them to do karaoke games.
2017300	2017540	Hmm.
2017981	2019521	That'd be interesting.
2020702	2022823	Or just call your friend.
2022883	2024143	I mean, seriously.
2024504	2026985	Well, but... Do you really... Hold on, hold on.
2027185	2028606	Long distance costs money.
2028826	2029786	Minutes cost money.
2029846	2032347	That's why VOIP is getting popular.
2032447	2033248	So I...
2034202	2037586	Yeah, but most people have pretty decent phone plans.
2037626	2041109	I mean, hell, people are spending like $100 a month on stupid unlimited plans.
2041489	2048276	Hell, my plan, which is dirt cheap, has unlimited nights and weekends and long distances included in there.
2048717	2053381	I mean, seriously, just... Okay, what if I want to talk to someone at 4 in the afternoon?
2054242	2055003	I have a cell phone.
2057065	2057946	I don't have a landline.
2058598	2059659	I know, I don't have a landline either.
2060299	2062721	But myself, I only have so many daytime minutes on myself.
2062761	2063682	Maybe I want to talk to people.
2063782	2066985	Or maybe one other thing is that, you know, maybe I want to talk to rooms.
2067025	2068486	Like, you know, somebody can talk to a party.
2068506	2069026	I text.
2069187	2070648	I text more than I talk on the phone.
2071288	2074010	And Dan uses his phone pretty much only people who call him or business.
2074050	2075732	And you get those rollover minutes and there you go.
2077121	2081084	Sagan Chat says, WeSpeak will also use friend codes for chatting with friends.
2081744	2085266	And follows up with, I don't know, WeSpeak would make a great room phone.
2085306	2086267	Groups talking to groups.
2086587	2087288	That's what I'm saying.
2087328	2088408	Network parties together.
2088929	2090209	That's going to be its biggest benefit.
2090470	2092811	But yeah, I think the friend codes for WeSpeak is a given.
2092911	2098555	I cannot imagine a Nintendo place where you could go into a room and chat with strangers.
2099235	2103039	Can you imagine the potential for horrible stories that could come with that?
2119930	2120991	I know, sad.
2121011	2123552	You have to understand, they come up with these ideas.
2123572	2124872	Sorry, that's too cool for our console.
2125053	2129395	You could kind of do that on Xbox Live now, except you're going to have to settle for Fusion Frenzy 2.
2129455	2135297	I put my phone on speaker and play Mario Party.
2135317	2137058	In which case, I think I'd rather chew glass.
2137739	2142141	There's always Vivo Pinata Party, which is slightly better.
2142281	2145222	So instead of chewing glass, Rob would want to chew plastic.
2145402	2149024	Mario Party is definitely the top tier, you know what I mean?
2152303	2152883	Let's move on.
2153063	2155404	We should make our own party game.
2155484	2157205	What would an Orange Launch Radio party game be?
2157785	2160026	Well, you'd have your weirdo map all over the place.
2160046	2161327	Get naked and tell your friends.
2161507	2164388	No, like Mario Party, except you've got weapons.
2166009	2167109	And you can get a tank.
2168330	2170150	Or a Humvee with a rocket launcher on it.
2170371	2171231	Mortal Kombat Party.
2171631	2172492	And, and, and, and, and.
2172652	2172832	What?
2173432	2175193	Sometimes the dice will have dirty commands on it.
2176113	2178014	And there'll be lots of guys making out.
2180623	2182764	Wait, Lick, Kiss, Suck.
2183745	2187347	You've got the dirty dice part of the game.
2187667	2189548	You have to roll them for guys making out.
2191469	2192030	Okay.
2192610	2194291	Sadly, I think no one would buy this game.
2195011	2196052	Yes, exactly.
2197493	2201175	So, a game that someone might buy, Pikmin.
2201215	2207659	They're actually doing a brand new series of games called Play on the Wii, or Wii Day Sobu.
2208639	2208819	And...
2210541	2211882	GameCube Games GameCube Games
2232307	2238752	And didn't everybody say back then, oh, just you wait, here comes the tidal wave, everything will be re-released.
2239752	2250740	And sure enough, here they go, they're re-releasing Pikmin, basically the GameCube version with, you know, fuckin' Wii controls thrown in there, woohoo!
2251781	2258966	And, um, yeah, so that'll be the first game that's gonna be part of that, but, um...
2260549	2261309	Never fear, though.
2261470	2268974	It's not actually the Pikmin game they were talking about before, which Miyamoto alluded to.
2269074	2270895	He is actually making a new Pikmin game.
2272616	2275737	This is not like, hey, we're going to release a new Zelda game.
2275817	2276378	Oh, just kidding.
2276418	2277438	It's the old Zelda game.
2277798	2285022	I'm actually kind of okay with this whole re-releasing of games things because you know everybody has that one game that they want out of this.
2285503	2286583	For me, it's F-Zero.
2288084	2289845	and maybe there's people that won't win Waker.
2289865	2290365	I don't know.
2290405	2292146	Isn't there something on GameCube?
2292326	2294147	Or what about Metroid Prime 1 and 2?
2294608	2296389	There's got to be something you want out of this.
2296589	2297029	Right, Loki?
2297829	2297930	No.
2299610	2300931	Maybe win Waker, but that's it.
2301912	2304653	Anyways, the Pikmin game is coming out December 25th in Japan.
2305134	2309616	It's going to be available for 3,800 yen, and that's approximately 36 bucks U.S.,
2311577	2314823	and also some other games that are going to be coming later on.
2315645	2322618	Nintendo's going to be releasing Donkey Kong Jungle Beat apparently on... Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
2322638	2323600	But with the lack of beat.
2324292	2332274	Yes, I guess before Pikmin, even though this was supposedly the first game, but Donkey Kong Jungle Beat will be coming out on December 11th in Japan.
2332774	2342657	Also coming soon will be Chibi-Robo Pikmin 2, Mario Tennis, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2, and... Of course, of course.
2342997	2343437	That's it.
2343597	2346758	No word on release dates for the rest of those, but...
2348328	2354751	Yeah, that's kind of cool, I guess, because the Wii certainly doesn't have enough GameCube ports.
2356792	2357273	All right.
2357953	2358973	I'm currently depressed.
2359474	2360134	I know.
2360154	2361755	While Loki was reading that story, what happened?
2361835	2366097	I pulled my DS out of my purse because I was looking for something, and the corner broke off.
2366437	2367078	How did that happen?
2367118	2367498	I don't know.
2367558	2369219	It must have gotten broken in my purse.
2369539	2370199	That sucks.
2370299	2371640	I guess I have to get a DSi now.
2373070	2374251	Oh, that's what she does.
2374751	2375892	No, but she's totally serious.
2375912	2376673	She was just showing it.
2376713	2377914	The corners, like, snapped off.
2378054	2379515	Yeah, I'll put it on the camera.
2379735	2381356	Is that how you get the husband to buy you new toys?
2381957	2382918	Aw, Dan, I broke it.
2382938	2383918	You can just get toys anyway.
2383938	2384399	It doesn't matter.
2384419	2385399	Dan, I broke it.
2385459	2386040	I'm sorry.
2386220	2386921	I need a new one.
2387061	2390984	Here, you know, I have a... No, I can fix this with duct tape and silicone glue.
2391084	2392665	There ain't nothing duct tape can't fix.
2392685	2393606	Seriously, just look at it.
2393806	2395227	I can fix it with silicone glue.
2395447	2399269	If you guys want these games, why don't you just buy the original GameCube games?
2399349	2400950	Remember, they do play on the Wii.
2401730	2403351	But enhanced Wii controls.
2404231	2404992	Really?
2405392	2412115	Have you known any games that the controls actually enhance the playability?
2412495	2419219	How many people prefer to play on the GameCube controller for Mario Kart and Smash Bros.?
2419619	2421240	Is it really enhancing stuff?
2421340	2422240	I'm sorry, no.
2422440	2423781	It's just going to get people to...
2425345	2445857	I don't know why more of their products and it's an excuse they're saying look we're still releasing first party products oh but they are remakes what if the games are only 20 bucks that's about how much a lot of the GameCube games still cost like the old Smash Brothers if they're 20 bucks then awesome hmm alright would you consider buying them if they were only 20 bucks no
2447240	2454246	DarkSakura is currently showing off that the DS does still work over on our Justin.TV feed, which you can see at Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2455006	2456748	Meanwhile, back to more news about the DSi.
2456968	2462072	And earlier, Loki had mentioned that there's going to be a store that's opening up, and that's why I kind of joked that it's the DSi phone.
2462112	2467556	But it is opening up, and they've already announced what the first few games are going to be available on the DSi shop.
2467576	2468056	And guess what?
2468436	2471679	They are games that you can already get in a traditional card format.
2471719	2473380	Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2.
2473500	2475001	But, but, but...
2476022	2476963	Thank you for watching!
2497794	2524226	because you know before too long in this DSi shop it'll be download new games for Brain Age not like necessarily a full blown Brain Age 3 but like download new brain training sequences as if they were rock band songs you know it's coming right that's why they're doing this they want a piece of the microtransaction pie and the Wii wasn't really set up to handle it very well even though I guess maybe Rock Band 2 is going to have it after all but still hmm
2526693	2527053	Why not?
2527193	2528054	The DS is out there.
2528354	2529635	Tons and tons of people have one.
2529695	2531276	It's a hugely popular system.
2531396	2532977	I have a broken one!
2533017	2534678	Let's bring microtransactions to it.
2534998	2536979	Let's get you to buy another DS system.
2537019	2539601	Maybe Nintendo will sell you some duct tape for 500 Nintendo points.
2539701	2545824	Because really, the DS is just kind of like an upgraded Game Boy Advance, and how many times have they tried to get you to buy the Game Boy?
2547205	2547505	Yeah.
2548466	2548926	Too many.
2549606	2552348	But, but, but... I have to get another one now.
2552930	2559054	And besides, with them releasing a new system like the DSi, they can release Mario, Super Mario Bros.
2559094	2561936	DSi, and Mario Kart DSi.
2562056	2562937	How about CSi DSi?
2562957	2563037	Rob?
2567170	2568451	How about CSI DSI?
2568471	2569932	CSI DSI, I like that idea.
2570132	2572113	That would be like a major awesome marketing point.
2572133	2572833	That would be awesome.
2573934	2574614	Alright, let's move on.
2574694	2575394	I'm going to weep.
2576135	2576315	Why?
2576415	2577996	I'm weeping inside of my soul.
2578216	2578376	Why?
2578416	2579076	Because you're DS?
2579517	2579937	I am.
2580237	2582278	Can we have a moment of silence please?
2583279	2583659	Excuse me.
2583819	2584439	Alright, there we go.
2585900	2591983	The ferret would like to make a statement on behalf of my poor, broken, like me, DS.
2592523	2593224	And what could that be?
2596257	2596817	Game News!
2597357	2598057	Sin and Punishment 2!
2599958	2600698	It's coming on Wii.
2602958	2604519	That's it.
2604739	2609119	Interesting because Sin and Punishment 1 was never really released in the US.
2609439	2610520	So that's kind of interesting.
2611540	2612260	I mean, it was.
2612280	2613260	We got it on Virtual Console.
2613340	2614800	Yeah, years later on Virtual Console.
2615361	2618341	That thing must have sold real well for them to want to bring that out over here.
2618641	2620862	Because that's an interesting game to dig out of the archives.
2622062	2623182	It's pretty badass looking, though.
2624079	2625540	Yeah, is that something you might be interested in picking up?
2625720	2626080	Yes.
2626320	2627320	It's looking pretty cool to me.
2627360	2633202	I wanted the first one to come out, although we didn't pick up the Nintendo 64 one online, but, you know.
2634143	2638444	You can always maybe get an import one of the real thing, but they're probably hard to come by at this point.
2638465	2638805	I doubt it.
2638845	2639365	I've seen them.
2639945	2640705	I've seen carts.
2640725	2644247	You can get imported Nintendo 64 carts for not bad.
2645527	2645807	All right.
2647028	2652050	Well, hey, if they release a demo or something or I can play a little bit of it, maybe I'll buy it.
2652090	2652750	It looks interesting.
2653530	2655351	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2671538	2686691	and by earning points by purchasing their games and I guess accessories, I'm not really sure about that, you will be able to trade those points in for Neato rewards like different accessories that are exclusive to the program.
2686711	2690274	You might remember in Japan they did some of those Game & Watch DS games.
2690434	2693957	There was a Tingle Balloon Flight game or Balloon Fight.
2696379	2697020	There was that weird...
2698339	2699539	Power Rangers looking thing.
2700000	2700280	I don't know.
2700740	2702400	But yeah, lots of exclusive stuff.
2702661	2704121	So that's pretty cool.
2704481	2707462	Hopefully we don't get lame shit on our side, you know.
2707943	2710403	Because they may have Club Nintendo and it's like, stickers!
2711924	2713004	Temporary tattoos!
2713505	2714345	Plastic rings!
2714525	2715265	Wallpapers!
2715345	2715845	Yay!
2715945	2716846	Mario underwear!
2716946	2717446	Yay!
2718887	2719267	Well, it was...
2720965	2726147	I've registered a lot of old Nintendo games on Nintendo's official site just in case something like this ever happened.
2726447	2727768	Am I going to get credit for that?
2728028	2728888	No, you're not.
2728908	2731569	Then I'm not registering anything else until this comes out.
2732289	2733590	Because I bought Wii Fit this week.
2733650	2735731	It doesn't matter because there's going to be something different.
2735751	2741072	There's a different Club Nintendo thing that you're going to have to register and not the actual games themselves.
2741913	2745434	But isn't that where the whole... Isn't that where I get the points from?
2745974	2747655	Yes, but that's going to be something separate.
2748695	2750255	Well, then why should I continue to register?
2750715	2752536	Why should you continue to buy anything from them?
2752776	2753436	That's what I say.
2753696	2755617	Well, if they put out a good game, I'm going to buy it.
2755877	2758297	And I wanted Wii Fit anyway, because I'm fat.
2759018	2760678	So... Rob!
2760878	2761098	What?
2762798	2763139	Come here.
2763939	2764379	Stand up.
2765179	2765579	Stand up.
2765639	2766379	Put your microphone down.
2767020	2767520	Stand up.
2769040	2770820	Come this way, because I'm not getting up.
2771161	2771841	Hold out your hand.
2773761	2773901	Ow!
2775542	2776982	Now, STFU.
2778703	2779784	Whatever, I need to tone.
2780504	2781184	But you're not fat.
2785067	2789249	Alright, now that I've been abused during this program.
2789349	2791270	It's not abuse, it's chastisement.
2791330	2792811	Can we please move on with gaming news?
2793412	2794132	Oh, it's me, hey.
2794152	2795153	Yeah, Rob.
2795333	2796934	Alright, well, the game The Conduit.
2796974	2802117	Lots of people have been looking forward to this because it's all sci-fi, futuristic-y, first-person shooter-y.
2802157	2803157	But hey, it's on the Wii.
2805302	2813974	And apparently, here's the weird thing, the Conduit was announced at the press event that it's going to be an exclusive first party shooter.
2814214	2815576	That's because she's a dumbass.
2815636	2817098	A lot of people got really excited about it.
2817138	2818440	Who do we mean by she, Loki?
2819386	2820087	The dumbass.
2820327	2826811	The one that talks about snowboarding and her son is so awesome because he makes cards for her.
2826972	2827632	Cammy Dunaway.
2828052	2829173	Yes, the dumbass.
2830014	2831635	So, here's the thing.
2832295	2839120	Apparently, it was called a first-party title, but then, a little later, apparently, it actually was retracted.
2840361	2842603	Nintendo is not actually publishing the conduit.
2843423	2846206	I knew right away that she was an idiot when she said that.
2846687	2848168	It said first party shooter.
2848188	2849770	I'm like, she meant first person shooter.
2850210	2851131	She's just dumb.
2852573	2852913	Whatever.
2854455	2856477	But really, I wouldn't be surprised if they picked this up.
2856557	2859040	And I think that they should anyways because...
2860421	2861081	Come on, man.
2861782	2862222	Seriously.
2863323	2865944	I guess the only concern would be that they're competing with themselves.
2865964	2867125	Does it really matter?
2867545	2872188	I mean, is it just like the ad dollars and the marketing push that will come out of it, depending on who picks it up?
2872208	2873389	You know, who's got the money to sell it?
2873809	2874610	I guess.
2874650	2878192	It's not going to change a damn thing about the game itself, right?
2878632	2879312	No, it's not.
2879392	2883795	But it's just that if there's a publisher, then it means it's coming out sooner.
2883895	2885016	It's just, you know, that.
2886633	2889074	And I don't understand why anyone wouldn't publish this game anyways.
2889094	2893957	There's been so much hype around it, and Nintendo's been pushing it so much anyways, and they don't have a publisher yet.
2895078	2899320	I mean, it's kind of retarded to be pushing a game that's not going to be coming out anytime soon, but whatever.
2901721	2903542	Well, I don't know.
2903582	2906404	Loki, this looks like something, and you've talked about this game before.
2906824	2909526	Do you care who publishes it, or you hate the game, or what?
2909746	2910406	No, I don't care.
2911187	2911527	Alright.
2912827	2913648	Well, then let's move on.
2914761	2919764	Well, Ian, remember that we talked about the game that even a penguin could play?
2920445	2920805	Mm-hmm.
2920985	2922186	And, Rob, you like penguins.
2922266	2923087	I love penguins.
2923487	2925628	Rob, that's why you should be running Linux.
2925748	2926149	Hi.
2926529	2928470	Well, you know, I like penguins just not that much.
2929311	2929611	Anyway.
2929651	2931632	That's why you should be wearing tuxedos, Rob.
2931812	2933594	I know, and that's why I should live in Antarctica.
2934014	2935055	And you should eat tuna.
2935255	2937016	You know, there's warm water penguins.
2939829	2952774	Anyway, the Penguin game is actually made by Yuji Naka that's called Let's Tap, which is, and it has nothing to do with penguins, I think.
2952954	2953754	Like tap dancing?
2954174	2966759	I don't know, but I guess it's supposed to be another kind of, I guess, I don't know if it's a music kind of game, but you use the Wiimote face down.
2967523	2979853	You basically, the game is played by facing the Wiimote, you put it face down on something, a surface, and you hit that surface with your fists, and it makes the Wiimote bounce, and you use that in different little mini-games.
2982815	2983275	Interesting.
2984716	2986718	Can I continue with my story, too?
2986798	2990081	Well, Let's Tap sounds like a tap-dancing game to me.
2990101	2992482	I don't know if you remember this.
2992502	2993143	I don't know.
2999927	3004308	Well, also, first of all, had I not been interrupted, I would have actually said something about... Oh!
3004748	3006009	That's what we do on this show.
3006869	3007489	Alright, what else?
3008049	3018691	Well, the other game is one called 428, which is a game that uses real photos of people in the city with text on it.
3019551	3024032	But it was actually shown in the whole show role thing that they did at the conference.
3024992	3025892	This will be out in December.
3026428	3027509	National Penguin Day No, I made that up
3055358	3056218	Alright, we'll see.
3057539	3058359	Let's read a book.
3058459	3060000	That should be a game that comes out on DS.
3060060	3061580	Let's read a book.
3061760	3062960	Let's get edumacation.
3063441	3065081	Let's watch television instead.
3065661	3068342	I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with Let's Read a Book.
3068382	3070483	I mean, seriously, some of the stuff that they come out with...
3071963	3072383	Weird!
3072463	3073044	Let's poop.
3073604	3073844	Yeah.
3074705	3081209	So, anyways, there were some other announcements that they made during the second day of their press event.
3081950	3085892	And these were, of course, new WiiWare games.
3086753	3091296	And, of course, the first one, which I think they've already talked about before, Tetris Party.
3092076	3093957	It's a brand new Tetris game.
3094017	3096659	In fact, there's modes in it that kind of look like Luminous a bit.
3097460	3097620	And...
3099454	3111283	They're actually going to even have a mode where it's called squat mode where you play using your ass on the Wii balance board and you drop your pieces that way.
3112864	3116207	I don't like hearing you squat and drop your pieces.
3118709	3120610	I pay good money for my Wii.
3123913	3124313	Wow.
3125114	3125654	Yeah.
3126655	3127476	Yeah, they went there.
3129035	3129861	And then, of course...
3131380	3134181	There's another game which they're comparing to LittleBigPlanet.
3134442	3135442	I'm sorry, no.
3136022	3137063	That's not even close.
3137523	3142406	But it's called Boings because there's a Z at the end because that's hip and cool.
3143847	3149570	It's from the company Ninja Bees who have put out a bunch of other games which all seem to look similar to each other.
3150470	3155092	And I guess they were saying that this game is kind of LittleBigPlanet meets LocoRoco.
3156053	3159375	And it's a 2D, 3D puzzler platformer.
3160395	3173437	and it's going to be I guess it follows these elastic creatures who are called the Boings and they can be grabbed and stretched and flicked across 30 levels of the game.
3174578	3182179	And I guess the game should be coming out pretty soon because it's just been submitted to Nintendo for approval and should be out either October 20th or 27th.
3182279	3187520	It is no LittleBigPlanet though, that's for sure.
3189420	3191001	But seriously, all their games look similar.
3193742	3195603	I guess the Tetris one kind of looks interesting.
3196824	3197124	We'll see.
3197404	3197825	It's neat.
3198705	3201187	By the way, we were talking about Tapit, obviously, a little bit ago.
3201287	3203688	Our chat room broke out in a game of Bop It.
3205100	3206842	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3228113	3234117	Anyway, I was trying to look for a clip of that commercial on YouTube to play in the background, but all I could find were commercials for Kidz Bop.
3234657	3235758	I didn't want to play those on the air.
3235778	3237519	That would be kind of frightening.
3237959	3239900	Can you imagine if there was a Kidz Bop sing star?
3241241	3246844	Alright, we've got to wrap up the Nintendo Press Conference, but there are so many more games we didn't even begin to talk about, like Punch-Out!
3247305	3248365	Hello, Punch-Out!
3248806	3251567	Also, a new WarioWare game is coming out, Mario & Luigi 3.
3252668	3257011	We have some of the other games that were coming out announced for the Wii...
3257998	3260180	There's a Clonoa remake, apparently.
3260580	3263263	Or it might be a new... No, it's a remake.
3263343	3264043	Door to Phantomville.
3264123	3264684	Clonoa!
3264784	3265484	Clonoa!
3265765	3267766	There is a karaoke game coming from Hudson.
3267987	3268547	Punch Out!
3268587	3272551	We didn't even talk about that, but it looked like in the previews there was King Hippo was back in it.
3272891	3273531	I know, I heard you.
3275513	3278556	A game called Cosmic Walker, which is a spacewalking game.
3279216	3281478	A memory game called Start with 100 Words.
3281698	3283780	But Clonoa... Remember these 100 words or you die!
3287076	3291340	Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean, the sequel to Endless Ocean was also announced.
3291780	3298807	And, and, and, some video from Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time that connects the DS to the Nintendo Wii.
3299087	3300448	Wasn't this supposed to be a launch title?
3301629	3302270	Clonoa.
3302290	3304252	Shut up!
3304612	3304872	Maybe.
3305673	3307755	Trace Memory, also known as another code.
3309396	3335490	Wand of Magic an action RPG that's all on the Wii and then of course plenty of crap on the DS as well including Mario and Luigi RPG 3 and another WarioWare game and a 3D version of Picross supposed to come out as well wow that sounds boring and a fortune telling game you remember the old taboo game on the NES I remember Klonoa I'm gonna kill you in your sleep
3336773	3338935	Oh, Jamie, Jamie, this game's right up your alley.
3338975	3341837	This is great.
3341977	3342518	Wait, what is this?
3342978	3344780	Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode.
3344800	3346201	It's a fashion game from Nintendo.
3346221	3346861	But Klonoa.
3347802	3348803	No, Klonoa's not in it.
3349243	3349984	I have Klonoa.
3351205	3352866	That game has a sad bummer ending.
3354568	3355108	Spoiler!
3355148	3359071	This show's going to have a bummer ending if you don't shut up about Klonoa.
3359331	3360552	Voldemort kills Klonoa.
3361133	3361453	Really?
3361613	3364175	Klonoa sounds like a sexually transmitted disease.
3364255	3365576	It kind of does, actually.
3365616	3365797	No.
3366758	3369559	Hey, that's about it we have for the Nintendo press conference.
3369679	3376382	But in our pre-OLR twit that we asked on the Twitter, it's twitter.com slash OLR, we asked this question to you guys.
3376782	3381444	Did Nintendo's press conference this week make up for their lackluster E3 showing?
3381484	3382144	Why or why not?
3382244	3383005	Loki, what do you think?
3383125	3384285	Before we get to the Twitter answers.
3384985	3390688	I thought that they made up for it a little bit, but there's still no mention of Disaster Day of Crisis, which I heard that they're...
3391693	3394594	Waiting to see how it does in Europe before they release it over here.
3395255	3395475	What?
3396155	3397376	I mean, that's kind of retarded.
3398656	3400777	Seriously, you're just waiting to see how it does in Europe?
3401277	3402978	That's going to piss people off.
3404959	3407320	But, I mean, I don't know.
3407900	3413903	I'm kind of... It was a little bit more exciting than what they showed at E3, but at the same time, I look at what they're putting out.
3414763	3416224	A remake of Punch-Out!
3417325	3418485	A remake of Pikmin!
3420406	3420486	Uh...
3422702	3428663	I don't know, a sequel to a game that we didn't get over here, which looks alright, but it's just okay.
3428703	3430323	It's nothing like, woo, awesome.
3430783	3432644	So in other words, you wanted more original IPs?
3433124	3438085	I wanted something a little bit, you know, they could have just shown Disaster Day of Crisis, because that actually looked pretty cool.
3438105	3438805	What about Conduit?
3439125	3439945	They did show Conduit.
3440085	3440945	I mean, that's a new thing.
3441085	3444246	Yeah, they showed Conduit, which, who knows when the hell that's going to be published.
3444286	3451307	In fact, there was something I heard about, like, Wii Motion Plus being added to it, and so that means it's not coming out until after March.
3452788	3453748	DarkSakura, what do you think?
3453768	3455209	Did they redeem themselves from E3?
3476824	3480905	I really, it's a really wait and see thing for me.
3481166	3482826	It really is a wait and see thing for me.
3483486	3489088	Just because I've gotten excited about stuff and then found out it to be a big load of crap.
3490249	3492289	And I don't like to be excited about loads of crap.
3494630	3497471	I would rather think, oh that looks like crap and be pleasantly surprised.
3498595	3499856	The conference was okay for me.
3500016	3501557	There wasn't anything that made me squee.
3501837	3502617	I think that's the thing.
3502857	3510081	It was missing that certain Nintendo fanboy squee, giggle, I love you Nintendo, have my babies.
3510401	3511382	That was kind of missing.
3512963	3514704	Well, then I'm glad you got something out of it.
3514744	3516264	But for me, there wasn't really any of that.
3516284	3518125	Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
3518406	3522808	Punch-Out didn't look that... I mean, it just looked updated, like, graphics-wise.
3522868	3524689	I mean, that's something that could have been released on WiiWare.
3526817	3527900	It doesn't look that different.
3527940	3530467	It's just like, ooh, look, now it's cel-shaded.
3531397	3531837	Awesome.
3532097	3532998	Is it any different?
3533178	3536260	Well, let's see what your Twitter users thought.
3536820	3538441	GS68 says, Sin and Punishment 2.
3538981	3542964	Too bad I was in Computer Lab when I read that, so I had to contain my fangasmic screens.
3543664	3544825	DJ Ranma S says, Nope.
3544925	3548787	As much as I like the DSi and the new games, still wasn't much to bring to the table.
3548887	3549747	Nice try, Ninty.
3549807	3550488	See you next year.
3551068	3557332	Actdeft says, At first I thought it was going to be the same lackluster conference, for the exception of the DSi, but then Nintendo went on and it was better.
3558333	3564540	Crows said, yeah, at least this one wasn't about cowbells, Animal Crossing, Wii Sport, puppies, Wii Music, or crazy drummers.
3564940	3565801	I don't want the new DS.
3566462	3570007	DarkTetsuya says, well, I wasn't crazy about the idea of buying another DS revision.
3570287	3572730	However, the new Punch-Out sounds kick-ass even without Tyson.
3573010	3576413	Here's what's bugging me about Nintendo.
3576513	3578455	They're not trying to innovate at all.
3578895	3579296	They're not.
3579396	3583119	They're just putting out what they can get by as something new.
3583219	3583900	Hold up, though.
3584580	3586882	Wasn't the Wii console itself innovation?
3586943	3589625	That's fine, but they did that, what, a couple years ago?
3589865	3591106	Now it's time for something new.
3591246	3592908	Time to keep up with the innovations.
3592988	3594970	No, don't encourage them to put out new peripherals.
3595510	3596971	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3619049	3621012	Old, made slightly new again.
3621373	3622054	They don't get it.
3622194	3628023	I think they're just watching what other people are doing, what's succeeding, and trying to emulate that, but they don't understand why it's working.
3628905	3630286	More responses from the Twitter.
3630446	3634508	Did the Nintendo press conference this week make up for the lackluster showing at E3?
3634849	3638771	Chris says, almost everything at the conference was rumored for a while, so it was pretty meh itself.
3639571	3641553	Picaruno says, just flat out, hell no.
3642293	3644174	Jacksonman says, yes, to an extent it did.
3644254	3645415	Something new is better than nothing.
3646656	3649858	Joshua Rover says, Ro-ever?
3650078	3650558	Ro-ever.
3650658	3651439	Joshua Ro-ever.
3652239	3652959	I had to spell it out.
3653439	3657280	It says, the recent press conference Nintendo held has completely redeemed them to me.
3657580	3659661	They really do care about the hardcore that built them.
3660501	3662501	Deekman says, nope, still pretty lackluster.
3663442	3666602	Ionotropic says, hell no, they're still not catering to the core gamer.
3666822	3668683	That's almost two completely conflicting answers there.
3668743	3670823	It's really interesting between that and what Joshua said.
3671383	3675124	And then Gerardimo says, no, their excuse for being lackluster will never be forgiven.
3675444	3678525	They could have done all this at E3 and a separate event for Wii Music.
3679085	3679506	Interesting.
3679966	3681267	Very differing responses, too.
3681307	3683069	Those are almost like polar opposites, some of those.
3683590	3687854	So Nintendo definitely knows how to get people talking, if nothing else.
3688783	3689924	Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway KORG DS10 DS

3749786	3750527	Game Party 2.

3755068	3756569	Line Rider 2 Unbound!
3756689	3760490	Hopefully actually coming out this time on the Wii.

3916071	3917992	That is all coming out on the Xbox 360.
3918052	3920754	I imagine it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.
3920814	3921214	Yes, it is.
3922095	3924536	That's really it for those two systems this week.
3924576	3926297	You've got to wait until next week for some of the bigger stuff.
3927378	3931540	However, let's take a look and see what's coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
3932301	3934842	Harvest Moon, I'm sorry, that's a US release.
3935503	3938845	Star Wars, The Force Unleashed comes out in Japan on the 9th.
3939365	3940166	So that's pretty awesome.
3941507	3942827	And let's check the PlayStation 2.
3944441	3953412	Same Guitar Hero Games, also Infinity Plus gets a release, as well as Daito Gaiken Koshiki Pachi Slot Simulator 24.
3953872	3957336	I don't think that's based off the TV series, though, just so you know.
3958257	3962182	Also, the PlayStation 2 version of Star Wars The Force Unleashed and a game called Will-O-Wisp.
3962722	3964843	Easter no Kiseki comes out as well.
3965503	3968245	Checking out the handheld systems to see what's coming out on there.
3968885	3971166	On the Nintendo DS, Snoopy DS.
3972206	3973907	Squeenix is putting out a Snoopy DS game.
3974247	3979090	Snoopy to Chugen Taichi Niiku comes out.
3979250	3981070	And yes, that is Snoopy as in Peanut Snoopy.
3981611	3984552	Because those characters are very popular over there still.
3985132	3987894	Nihongo de Asobo Kawaii
3988874	4013606	Konyu DS 2 comes out as well and Tetsudo Musume DS Terminal Memory comes out in both a regular and limited edition pack on the Nintendo DS and it looks like some game that centers around like stewards and stewardesses on airlines I don't know if it's some type of like drama turned game but there you go um
4015325	4028212	Also coming out on the Sony PSP, Mahjong Portable Jansu Battle is getting a price reduction.
4029012	4029852	That's really about it.
4029893	4031313	There is one other game coming out.
4031393	4032674	Looks to be a big one.
4033414	4034575	Macross Ace Frontier.
4035515	4036076	Sweet!
4036556	4037656	From Bandai Namco.
4037897	4038877	And one more.
4038917	4039838	Wait, wait, wait.
4040038	4040718	Ace Frontier?
4040798	4042419	I thought the series was Macross Frontier.
4042947	4044568	That's what they're calling it, Macross Ace Frontier.
4045169	4049412	And one other game that looks, I think it's like an Othello, oh no, it's Go.
4049573	4052155	It's a version of Go on your PSP.
4052655	4059421	It's Umewaza Ikari no Yahashi Ego, and I think that must be like a championship player that's on the cover.
4060182	4061743	So, she's pretty.
4062924	4064786	They're using her pretty face to sell just Go.
4066407	4067768	There you have it, your Japanese release dates.
4069249	4071071	Let's move back into some gaming news, DarkSakura.
4071496	4072216	Do we gotta?
4072596	4073057	Yes, we gotta.
4073077	4076438	Actually, this makes me very happy, and I'm going to download it depending on how it plays.
4078699	4082080	But they're bringing Pole Position to the iPhone.
4082280	4083200	That makes me very happy.
4083260	4085521	It's all cutesy 3D-y.
4085781	4087042	They look like little toy cars.
4088582	4089003	But it's...
4090524	4091886	Thank you for watching!
4107329	4118774	If you do play with moving the iPhone around, I would prefer that it be a little bit more natural and intuitive and not have to be held at some funky-ass bizarre angle.
4119374	4120494	But I'm going to give it a try.
4120534	4128698	I mean, it's $9.99, but I think that it might be worthwhile after a check arrives at my house.
4130218	4130558	All right.
4132679	4133560	And it's pole position.
4133740	4134220	It's old school.
4137952	4140713	Sadly, you don't really get the cool crashes in Pole Position.
4140733	4145675	It was just a little explosion graphic, but at least it was an explosion.
4146735	4149617	I remember the Pole Position cabinets from back in the day.
4149657	4150577	That was good times.
4151157	4152138	That was 80s gaming.
4152198	4153198	I love to sit down once.
4153238	4155879	You know that we actually built our first main cabinet out of a Pole Position.
4155919	4156839	Yeah, you still got it, right?
4157360	4158340	Somewhere, I think.
4158920	4162402	Well, now we've got our Reaper Pac-Man thing that we were going to put it in.
4163022	4163142	Cool.
4163162	4163302	Cool.
4167199	4172144	D3 is putting out a new game called Eat Lead.
4174947	4177589	It's kind of interesting the way they promoted this thing.
4178350	4179951	It stars a supposedly...
4180936	4186797	Old School Action Game Superhero Matt Hazard Weapons of Matt Destruction Altered Beast
4205041	4218494	Matt Hazard 3D, Fistful of Hazard, Hazmat Carts, and You Only Live 1370 Times.
4218554	4223239	Along with all this stuff, the game itself is actually going to be a 3D shooter.
4226162	4228424	Some interesting stuff to go along with that is
4231069	4232230	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4249223	4256309	And it's got a script written by, I guess, this guy, David Ellis, who did, I guess, the Doctor Who serial, The Faceless Ones.
4257771	4261754	And the game itself is going to be... It kind of reminds me a little bit of Coated Arms, I guess.
4262294	4268780	Because the shooter game itself will take place across all sorts of different video game cliches.
4269080	4272223	But you can actually hack into the different characters and do different things to them.
4272643	4273323	So that's kind of neat.
4274324	4274444	And...
4276488	4277429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4306511	4307051	You know what I mean?
4307491	4308852	It sounds like a serious movie.
4308872	4310692	Some of those movies like Meet the Spartans, right?
4310772	4316554	Hey, it makes fun of all these great movies that came out in the past year, but it's just the dumbest thing you'll ever see.
4316594	4319395	There's a lot of games that have done it right.
4319595	4325117	I think TimeSplitters did the whole making fun of shooters games kind of right.
4325137	4328378	They actually just went really bizarre with that game, but it was fun.
4328558	4329679	That was the best part about it.
4330410	4337333	And I hope they come out with a new one because they released some teaser concept art for it this week as well.
4337993	4349178	But anyways, and it says he's making his next-gen comeback against all of his old enemies in a hilarious parody of the last 25 years of gaming.
4350758	4351038	I don't know.
4351058	4357441	It reminds me of something like a character that could have been one of the shareware characters from like Apogee or Epic Games.
4359390	4359851	It could be cool.
4359871	4360911	I guess we'll see.
4360931	4363073	It comes out in, I think, February.
4363633	4363974	All right.
4364754	4365155	We'll see.
4366135	4369978	One other thing that's coming out relatively soon, a Spore expansion.
4370459	4372300	That's right, because Spore wasn't enough.
4372560	4374301	Spore expansion, November 18th.
4374622	4376683	The Cute and Creepy Parts Pack.
4377324	4377704	It's only $20.
4377764	4382528	And, you know, there isn't much out there about what this is.
4382648	4386090	But, you know, if it's the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack, do you think it might be?
4386250	4386811	Oh, I don't know.
4387231	4388994	New parts for your creatures that you make?
4389875	4395301	Well, it was leaked on... Apparently, Amazon had the store pages up first, but now it's also being spotted on GameStop.
4395322	4398105	So, it is coming on November 18th.
4398405	4400047	Now, my question is digital downloads.
4400108	4402991	Surely, this has to be something they're going to offer us that as well.
4403031	4403952	I mean, why not, right?
4404894	4405755	You're willing to give them money.
4407747	4412333	No word as to how many parts we're talking about yet, but for $20, there better be quite a few.
4412573	4414436	Does the new expansion come with new DRM?
4414456	4416018	Because that'd be awesome.
4416058	4419042	I'd pay the $20 if it'll uninstall Securom.
4419442	4419963	No, I'm just kidding.
4420003	4421465	I shouldn't have to pay anything to get rid of that.
4422166	4423087	But you know what I'm saying.
4423968	4441700	so there you go spore expansion for those of you spore addicts and I think I said this during Bobby's show I don't know if I said this earlier in this show but some of the monsters in Silent Hill Homecoming kind of look like they were made in spore they're kind of creepy looking like arms off people's backs and stuff scary very scary are there any penis monsters?
4442202	4443303	There are no penis monsters.
4445645	4446166	Fail!
4446206	4448888	Why would you want to ruin Silent Hill with penis monsters?
4448968	4451610	You know, put penis monsters in a game that's already... Well, we've got Pyramid Heads.
4451670	4452471	That's good enough.
4452691	4453232	Exactly.
4453572	4454813	Is he just as prolific?
4455013	4456555	That's what I hear, but I haven't gotten to him yet.
4456575	4457175	I haven't played enough.
4457195	4457696	Okay.
4457736	4458096	So we'll see.
4458877	4462119	Yeah, VXJasonXV in chat says, No one bought Spore except for you.
4462200	4462980	Yeah, probably true.
4463020	4463621	Bobby did.
4463841	4465122	I'm probably the only one that actually bought it.
4465182	4465582	Oh, yeah, that's right.
4465622	4465963	Bobby did.
4466417	4468799	DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
4495047	4500408	Well, first of all, I'd like to play the intro to this in just a second, which is why I late the one I did.
4500668	4500869	Okay.
4500889	4502029	Wait a second before you start it.
4502049	4507650	But the game is called Nekatsu Koko Dodgeball Boo, which is basically Super Dodgeball over here.
4508210	4509311	It's one of the Kunio games.
4511151	4511411	Nice.
4511631	4513652	Shall we have a little bit of intro?
4513712	4514392	We shall.
4514492	4514832	Let's see.
4514872	4516692	Do we want the whole Neo Geo splash screen and everything?
4516912	4520573	Why not?
4520713	4522674	That's what a Neo Geo sounds like when you press the on button.
4522894	4523074	Yep.
4532062	4534664	SUPER DODGE BALL
4563018	4569160	As you eliminate characters, basically a little angel takes them to the top of the screen and they go away.
4569900	4574162	But your life bar is basically how many teammates you have left.
4574882	4577363	So you defeat the other team by knocking out the teammates.
4577383	4580144	I mean, it is, you know, dodgeball.
4581304	4584085	So you have to keep knocking them down with the ball until they're just done.
4584626	4590828	And you've also got a special throw called your power shot that your team captain can use.
4592561	4595945	I have to clarify some things in chat, because I love this game.
4595965	4597787	I was very excited when DarkSakura picked it.
4598728	4599589	I really do love this game.
4600149	4603953	Ranma asked in chat, isn't this the same version as on NES, same characters?
4604374	4611702	No, it's not, because these are like custom characters, whereas the NES had the very general, you know, like, there are definitely related games.
4611982	4612963	They play very similarly.
4613703	4615544	They're both in the Kunio series.
4616065	4626991	The one that I linked here, though, is actually the... I believe the captain is the main character from what we got as River City Ransom.
4627591	4628012	Naketsu...
4631434	4634296	Hot Blooded High School Story or whatever.
4635576	4641680	But anyway, I like the special edition because honestly it has better music.
4642661	4648325	But in this one though, you start off by going around the world and you pick your team from different places.
4648745	4653508	But you start off with a game between Dallas and Chicago to show who's going to represent the United States.
4654369	4656090	And then you go around to England, Iceland...
4657170	4662914	China, Africa, although in later versions it was changed to Kenya, so you could run as fast as Kenyans.
4663534	4663934	And Japan!
4666936	4673159	But when you beat Japan, you actually get your World Cup given to you by a ninja.
4674580	4689172	So, um, yeah, what I was basically saying is that the game, um, was part of the, uh, the Kunio series, um, the first one being, um, Neketsu Koha Kunia-kun, which was what we got as, uh, Renegade over here.
4689813	4693436	And we know that the other one in the series was, um, River City.
4695017	4701082	But the way that the game starts is basically Kunio gets hit in the head with a dodgeball and his, uh, teammates go and beat him up.
4701883	4703324	There you go.
4704033	4711896	And the teams of Dallas and Chicago were actually the teams of Neketsu High School and Hanazono High School in the Japanese version.
4712556	4714336	So they, of course, modified it.
4714576	4715857	There was an NES version.
4717417	4722059	It actually was published by Technos, which was the one that released the arcade version.
4722559	4723819	But it's not even the same.
4723979	4724419	It's not.
4724520	4725540	I mean, from what I remember.
4725980	4726620	Okay, sorry.
4727140	4728781	I'm very passionate about my dodgeball games.
4729521	4731622	Um, it actually had six members.
4731642	4733602	You had the team captain and five others.
4734022	4737363	And they were all the same size instead of having your captain be, like, uber huge.
4738163	4740884	And, um, you could only have three players inside the court.
4741544	4746165	And you could arrange your positions, though, um, at the beginning of each match.
4746205	4749346	So you could, you know, make use of your different techniques.
4750266	4750346	Um...
4751326	4757210	You can actually adjust your energy, throwing power, throwing technique, and ball break, which is the curve.
4757410	4761212	You had agility, catching technique, and damage capacity.
4761452	4762833	There are also two extra teams.
4762853	4764234	There was India and USSR.
4768116	4775101	So, it had a lot of the same stuff, but had some pretty significant changes, I guess, to make it work on the NES.
4775121	4776923	We had to deal with a lot of that.
4776983	4778263	You remember the version of Strider?
4778704	4781686	It was based off of comic books, though.
4781746	4784788	Yeah, and Strider was also a totally different game.
4784888	4786850	The story was based off of comics.
4786890	4788891	It's not even the same type of game.
4789191	4792634	The Sega Strider was just a straight-up arcade action game, whereas...
4793614	4797857	I don't know, there was that more open world feel to the NES one.
4798057	4801079	Anyway, we've already done Strider.
4801339	4803441	Yeah, sorry.
4803641	4807023	I want to say this, because VXJsNextV in chat brings up a related game.
4807603	4811166	Was anyone else epic disappointed by Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball?
4811566	4813908	Yes, I played the demo and I thought it was awful.
4814088	4814848	Awful, awful, awful.
4814928	4816589	And I quit in about five minutes.
4816629	4821833	And maybe I shouldn't judge something completely based on five minutes of gameplay, but honestly, with demos, that's about how long you have to sell me.
4822373	4824114	and it made me miss this game.
4843162	4844383	Ugh, that caught my breath for a second.
4844663	4845463	But there were other ones.
4845523	4849785	On X6800, it was released by SPS, which was a direct arcade port.
4850085	4866531	PC Engine had Neketsu Koko Dojibou Bupishi Bangaihen, which translates to Neketsu High School Dojibou Club Bonus PC Edition, that was released by Maxsoft Soft in 1990, which I've played this version a ton.
4866591	4867372	It's actually pretty cool.
4869893	4873974	You actually are having to fight off aliens disguised as dodgeball fighters.
4874974	4879315	There's a Windows version of the Famicom port that was done by BRS Corp in 2003.
4879935	4887497	PlayStation 2 had an arcade port that was put out by Hamster Corp as part of the Oretachi Gessenzoku lineup.
4888538	4892879	The Famicom version came out on Game Boy as part of the Kunio Kuniketsu Collection 1.
4893999	4897882	Naketsu Koko, Dodgeball Buu, Kyoteki, Dodgeball Soldier no Maki
4910853	4917956	Fearsome Rival, Tale of the Dodge Soldier, Kunio-kun no Dodgeball Daioh Zenin Shugo
4930642	4931963	France, Brazil, and Germany.
4932463	4943867	And then the one that we're having a video of here, which is the Kunio no Neketsu Dojibouro Densetsu, which is Kunio's Neketsu Dojibouro Legends, the Neo Geo release.
4943987	4947749	Actually, Technos did release this one, so that was pretty cool.
4948089	4961914	But you also have special moves, not just for your captain, but you have several main characters, and you have to do Street Fighter 2-like commands to get them to go off, like you saw the girls do their little attacks in there.
4962394	4972418	But you've got seven playable characters, and you also have them being the main characters from the Ketsu Kouha Kunioku, like in Renegade over here.
4973358	4979440	Um, also Super Dodgeball Advance, we, um, it wasn't actually a Kunio game.
4980721	4986103	So, but it was done with a lot of the same character style and gameplay.
4986163	4988064	It was put out by Million, haven't you?
4988724	4994686	But they also, the Million did do an official DS sequel called Chounaketsu Koko Kunio-kun Dodgeball Boo.
4995646	4996327	I just like saying it.
4996707	4996907	Wow.
4998869	5003471	and there's also Super Dodgeball Brawlers that's supposed to be by Axis.
5003551	5005532	It was supposed to come out.
5006412	5008453	Has it already come out?
5009274	5009654	Yeah.
5009734	5010614	I haven't played that one yet.
5010634	5012095	I played the Game Boy Advance one, but not that one.
5013138	5015779	I wonder if you can go in there and order food at a deli.
5015799	5017719	I wonder if it has booty, like in the spa.
5017739	5019080	Remember River City Ransom?
5019100	5019600	8-bit ass?
5036716	5042660	I'm still going to have to play the Japanese version of River City Ransom for you.
5043000	5048964	Just because it's so cool, they go into a little kusatsu and order food and they're all like doing little anime smiley things.
5049484	5051545	I always liked that the smiles were free.
5051765	5052986	I always liked that the smiles were free.
5053326	5054107	That was great.
5054547	5055888	Alright, anything else on Super Dodgeball?
5055908	5056408	Um, no.
5056969	5059070	Alright, there you have it.
5059430	5062713	Your classic game of the week, and a real classic, and yeah...
5063951	5064572	Don't bother with pirate images.
5064592	5067154	That's because I picked something I had already done before and forgot about it.
5067454	5067874	That's alright.
5067934	5068575	It's bound to happen.
5068595	5069596	How many weeks have we been doing this now?
5069616	5070156	At least 50.
5071878	5073119	We started it on episode 250.
5073439	5074880	Are we running out of classic games?
5075141	5075421	No!
5076181	5076502	Never!
5077262	5079064	I'm like, as I can think of a few we haven't done.
5079624	5080105	Like what?
5080986	5083187	You have never named one single solitary Commodore 64 game.
5084401	5086303	Guess what system Jamie didn't play.
5087244	5092168	Well, if you're ever out during a week, I will bring a Commodore 64 game in the picture.
5092188	5093429	I already know which one I'm going to do, too.
5094130	5094631	I already know.
5094931	5095231	Okay.
5095311	5098194	And it's one of those games people are going to go, WTF is he picking that game?
5098214	5101016	Because you better watch out or I'll start busting out the ColecoVision, yo.
5101116	5101437	All right.
5101517	5101737	Wait.
5102217	5103599	Mousetrap, Venture.
5104199	5105380	Alright, plenty more to come.
5105400	5107321	She's got enough to carry us through episode 400.
5107901	5108342	GORF.
5108742	5110022	I freaking love GORF.
5110403	5111343	I almost did GORF.
5112184	5113484	Okay, GORF is soon.
5113725	5114345	Maybe next week.
5115065	5116106	Little teaser for next week.
5116186	5116486	GORF.
5116966	5117587	Alright, anyhow.
5118415	5135142	that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio but hey stay tuned there's plenty more to come after a quick break and hey during the break tonight since there's not a lot of free commercials for the free break anymore because no one's sending me stuff but that's okay we got something even better giving stuff away if you were paying attention to last week's show
5135762	5137123	We're drawing the names right after this.
5137203	5144307	If you weren't paying attention to last week's show, you got about five minutes to find it because we're giving away some free Xbox 360 games right after the ES.
5144367	5148550	I said games, and I'll explain more a little bit about that right after the break.
5148630	5152112	But for you podcast listeners, you have to wait like five seconds for that little transition noise.
5152432	5153033	That's all you need.
5153633	5158576	But live listeners, you have to sit and listen to some music while we take a break, rest our voices, potty, drinks, all that stuff.
5159457	5160797	Well, not like drink from the potty.
5160817	5162398	That would be nasty, but forget it.
5163399	5166093	Alright, we'll be right back with more Orange Launch Radio right after this.

5242537	5242997	Sorry, guys.
5243037	5243658	Maybe next time.
5244859	5247361	Alright, so we'll get those codes sent off to our winners.
5247622	5251025	But for now, we're going to get back into Orange Lounge Radio.
5257216	5264498	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 5th, 2008, where we are right in the middle of episode number 297.
5264918	5273620	And of course we tape live every week, Sunday nights, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
5274280	5281521	And if you can't join us live though, you know you can always interact with us through the Twitter, through the live journal, the email bag that we'll get to later.
5281581	5282782	There's just tons and tons of ways.
5282902	5283222	We will.
5283942	5284102	Yeah.
5284847	5286448	You have to do the mailbag, sorry, like it or not.
5287589	5290070	Alright, but first we're going to do some more gaming news, right Loki?
5290491	5291251	Yes, that's correct.
5291491	5298436	In fact, little known fact, there is a Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2 coming out.
5299316	5303719	And this is not to be confused with another expansion disc we'll be talking about in a little bit.
5304279	5312885	But Volume 2 of course contains some tracks that were available on the download sites, both PlayStation Network and...
5313545	5315909	and on Xbox Live Marketplace.
5316530	5328188	The track list contains 20 different songs and includes Avenged Sevenfold, Afterlife, Blondie with Call Me, Weezer, El Scorcho, Devo, Girl You Want,
5329666	5358075	Maximo Park, Girls Who Play Guitars, Disturbed, Indestructible, Angels and Airwaves, It Hurts, The Cars, Just What I Needed, The Police, Message in a Bottle, Pixies, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Duran Duran with Rio, Motley Crue, Saints of LA, which I want to say that was a free track, so that's not really fair, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Simple Man, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow, Heyo, and...
5360196	5361156	I actually like that song.
5361237	5367441	Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Fall Out Boy, This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race.
5367901	5369503	It's a goddamn arms race, actually.
5369823	5370463	But it's censored.
5370824	5371044	Yes.
5371924	5376368	Papa Roach, Time Is Running Out, Garbage, Why Do You Love Me,
5377148	5377888	JizzPriest, SmashingPumpkins0
5400240	5407548	and this will also have, I think, achievements as well because you can play this game standalone as well.
5408169	5410832	Well, that sucks because I have 10 of those songs already.
5410912	5412994	Is the game going to reimburse me for the 10 I already bought?
5413274	5413455	No.
5414015	5414376	Lame.
5414936	5417859	Well, you also have access to Xbox Live Marketplace.
5417879	5420022	I want achievements because I want achievements.
5422324	5426126	Well, I mean, you know, I don't really, but I'm being devil's advocate here.
5426266	5431969	I mean, why is that fair that somebody who waited to buy it gets to get a thousand more gamerscore?
5432129	5439213	This is really meant, I think, for the people that don't have live, and this is the only way that they can buy expansion packs.
5440013	5463182	but it says yeah included code allows these songs to be downloaded and played with Rock Band or Rock Band 2 via the PlayStation Network of course this is the PlayStation 3 version I'm looking at the back of so that's interesting though they can be downloaded for Rock Band 1 as well so hmm interesting but yeah this game you do not it does not require you to have the first game or the second game
5465342	5465882	Interesting.
5466102	5466622	I don't know, though.
5466662	5469663	Again, I already kind of own pretty much the whole game, so there you have it.
5469803	5472804	But for those who don't, and you know, to be honest, probably just buy them online.
5472844	5473844	Probably a little cheaper anyways.
5475084	5475825	Well, actually, no.
5475865	5484487	If it's $2 a song, that'd be about $40, and this is going to retail for $29.99, so you save a little bit of money.
5484647	5485067	I'm curious.
5485107	5487768	Is there anyone in our chat room right now that would be interested in buying this?
5488568	5489248	I bet not a one.
5490899	5498242	Just because everybody in our chatroom is obviously online enough where they're online chatting with our show that they probably don't, you know, their console's online too, I imagine.
5499622	5504144	I guess it's good for those that don't have it, or for those that are on the Wii where that's not really implemented yet, even though it's supposed to be.
5504264	5506165	Yeah, it will be, hopefully, with this one.
5506405	5513047	So maybe, you know, by the time the Wii version comes out, because I think this is not scheduled to come out until November.
5513347	5515228	It's around the same time as the Wii version, so...
5516828	5519469	All right, well, that's not the only expansion for Rock Band coming soon.
5519489	5520309	But here's the interesting thing.
5520329	5523750	The other expansion that's coming is not something that you can already download.
5523790	5525351	It's a brand new track pack.
5525411	5528611	It's ACDC Live is coming.
5528691	5529192	Sweet.
5529272	5530072	Here's the weird thing, though.
5530112	5535993	It's a Walmart and Sam's Club exclusive because I believe there's a new ACDC album that is an exclusive.
5536574	5537434	So go figure.
5538354	5541595	And for those of you in foreign countries that are pouting about that, hey,
5541915	5542335	Guess what?
5542515	5545596	Also for Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in early December.
5545696	5548617	So they didn't forget about you unless you're not in one of those countries.
5548637	5549577	And they did forget about you.
5551038	5556980	All the songs from the disc, you can use them in Rock Band and Rock Band 2 using an export authentication code.
5557000	5557660	But here's the thing.
5558000	5560661	You can only use that once per disc.
5561461	5564622	And I think that's the same with this track pack 2 as well.
5564662	5566363	I think it's only once per disc.
5567469	5568509	Because, I mean, come on.
5568549	5573170	They're smart enough to know, hey, they're just going to buy it and download it for five bucks to all their friends.
5573190	5575351	You can only do that with Rock Band 1.
5575971	5579752	And, by the way, that $29 price point is only for the PlayStation 2 version.
5579772	5585013	If you want the fancier ones for a 360, PS3, or Wii, $39.88 is the magic price.
5585133	5585653	That's fucked up.
5585673	5588274	November 2nd for... Here's the weird thing.
5588314	5590114	Again, if you want it on Wii, though, you've got to wait.
5590194	5591635	November 16th is the date for you.
5591655	5594915	360, PS3, and PS2, you get it on November 2nd.
5595276	5596756	That's ACDC Live.
5597336	5605320	And apparently the game has its own set of achievements, which is very much in line with the same thing Loki was talking about.
5605360	5608862	Although, funny enough, I'm seeing a lot of news this week on the blogs about this.
5608962	5610803	I'm not seeing a damn thing about what you just told us.
5611663	5613704	Is that because you told us a secret or what?
5614265	5616106	No, I don't know why this isn't out there.
5616146	5617927	I mean, it's going to be available soon.
5617967	5620488	It's just I guess maybe it's not as exciting as ACDC.
5620908	5621448	I guess not.
5621788	5624849	But there was a lot of confusion, I know, with at least us selling this.
5624910	5627691	You know, it's like, is this the same damn thing as the Walmart one?
5628231	5628511	Right.
5628571	5630091	But no, it's actually something completely different.
5630452	5630992	Interesting.
5631552	5642936	And I was going to say, probably the reason why it's not coming out on the 16th for the Wii is because Rock Band 2 is going to be the only one you'll be able to download that one for, I think.
5643536	5644797	Or to do download play on.
5645653	5645993	All right.
5646574	5647214	Well, there you have it.
5647274	5647875	Coming soon.
5648315	5651897	If you like ACDC, get ready to ring your hell's bells.
5651937	5652758	Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
5653798	5655360	Actually, no, wait, no, that doesn't make any sense.
5655600	5657681	I was going to say, well, that doesn't make any sense.
5657701	5663525	That's coming out on the 16th, and that means that you'll be able to save stuff to your SD member cards, but I forgot games already allow you to do that.
5663565	5665146	It's channels that will be coming in 2009.
5665546	5665986	Right, and it's 2009.
5666026	5666367	Yeah.
5667147	5667708	So there you have it.
5668368	5669108	All right, we'll move on.
5669148	5669689	More gaming news.
5671212	5679015	Well, for anyone who played the first episode for Penny Arcade and liked it, the second one is going to be cheaper.
5679335	5691299	Hot Head Games is actually listening to consumer feedback and is going to be releasing the game for 1,200 Microsoft points, which is...
5693620	5696261	10 pounds 20 pence in pounds.
5698082	5709890	It'll be $14.95 US dollars on a PC, which is 7 pounds 50 in the UK.
5709910	5712291	$15 is still expensive for that game anyways.
5713792	5715633	It's ridiculous to charge $20 for it.
5715653	5717274	I'm not sure if I want to buy the sequel.
5718495	5720617	Well, I'm still interested.
5721852	5724994	I haven't finished the demo of the first one yet, to be honest.
5725134	5727255	I don't know.
5727355	5728436	I never finished the first one.
5728676	5730277	I got bored with it too quick.
5730818	5731438	Played other things.
5732987	5733227	Oh well.
5754272	5776378	a bunch of titles and a few unannounced titles which we'll just have to be surprised about but some of the things they're going to be showing off Sengoku, Basara, Battle Heroes looks like Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Fantasy Dissida or Dissida Final Fantasy I like how they have Isn't that that awesome looking fighting game?
5776538	5779119	Yeah that's the fighting game for the Final Fantasy fighting game.
5779419	5783400	I want to see more on that Ratchet and Clank, Maru High Mission Ignition
5785131	5788744	that's kind of a cool name Bleach, Soul Carnival, Pot of Pond 2
5792330	5801297	Shin, uh, Stapatapon, Shin, um, Sengoku, Musou, or Musoui, I guess, uh, Multirade.
5802077	5804799	I think that's, uh, that's not the Gundam one.
5805019	5805219	Hmm.
5806460	5808542	And, uh, let's see what else we have here.
5808562	5811784	Like, uh, new Idolmaster game, Idolmaster SP.
5812765	5813085	Awesome.
5813285	5815106	Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam.
5816087	5826274	Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology 2, 3 unannounced Sony titles, Guitar Hero, Legend of the Rock, FIFA 09, Street Fighter 4, Resident Evil 5, Luminous Supernova, Metal Gear Online, Way of the Samurai 3, Sonic World Adventure,
5842035	5857504	SoCalm Confrontation, PlayStation Home, that's not a game, and MotorStorm 2, LittleBigPlanet, Resistance 2, SmackDown vs. Raw 9, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2, and R2 Ultimate Ninja Storm.
5858084	5860545	GS68 in the chatroom asks, Luminous Supernova?
5860966	5862346	I believe that was a game that came up earlier.
5862406	5866088	It's the new PS3 Network Luminous game, right?
5866188	5867149	Yes, yes, that's the one.
5868544	5869445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5889904	5891566	for a company to show games that are already out.
5891606	5894068	I mean, hell, when we went to E3 one year, they were still showing off Oblivion.
5894468	5898672	Granted, they were still releasing download content on a regular basis at Bethesda, but whatever.
5899572	5901554	Konami is also showing off World Soccer Winning 11 2009.
5901634	5901994	Gensu Suikoden...
5905217	5910301	Actdeft, Tikris, Castlevania Judgment, Silent Hill Homecoming, Chaotic Eden, Tongari Bushi, Tumaho no 365, Nichi
5930397	5931978	Your guess is as good as mine as to what that is.
5933039	5938042	Also showing friendly company to Konami, Hudson will be showing some titles on the floor.
5938703	5941225	Some Wii titles that they'll be showing on the Tokyo Game Show floor.
5941365	5946108	Fishing Master World Tour, Marble Saga Kororimpa.
5946228	5949490	So now it's another, it looks like a new Kororimpa game coming exclusively to the Wii.
5950271	5954493	It's new levels, four-person multiplayer gameplay apparently is going to be in this new game.
5954754	5956515	You can actually use your Mii this time around.
5956795	5965862	I'll tell you what, the first Kororimpa game, hours of entertainment by making the little Marba the panda ball and changing the sound effects to the farting noise every time it would hit the wall.
5969525	5973828	That's what the game sounds like, it's hours of entertainment because we all are seven at heart.
5974849	5980674	But here's the thing, now they've built like a story around it, because the first game was just kind of like, eh, just kind of go, but now they're-
5986345	5988086	I mean, come on, stop beating around the bush.
5988106	5989146	Just make a new Marvel Madness game.
5989166	5989867	Okay, wait, hold on, though.
5989887	5990287	Hold on, though.
5990307	5991807	You've got to listen to this story, okay?
5992548	5999251	In this game, you are going to go on a quest with a character named Anthony the Ant, and Anthony the Ant is searching for the golden sunflower.
6000538	6008844	and you guide Anthony's marble around the ant world and you get items that will help you reach the golden sunflower and you will help save Anthony's colony.
6010105	6016309	Also, many more dangering mazes, amazing widgets and gadgets to help your little ant friend out.
6017490	6019932	Oh, and one more thing.
6020372	6022213	We connect 24 capability.
6022513	6024074	You can make your own stages in edit mode.
6025095	6026076	Kind of neat, huh?
6027277	6028558	That's what the first game should have been.
6029465	6030025	That's alright though.
6030246	6030666	We forgive him.
6030926	6033268	Hey, one more game to announce from Hudson.
6033288	6034289	It's going to be a Tokyo Game Show.
6034729	6036711	Not on the Wii, but on PlayStation Network.
6037132	6038493	Bomberman Ultra.
6039714	6040514	Bomberman Ultra.
6040534	6042136	8-player multiplayer online.
6042776	6043457	14 different arenas.
6043477	6044858	4-player local gaming.
6045138	6047320	You can customize your own Bomberman character.
6047981	6048922	50 different costumes.
6049302	6050263	Adding up to 150,000 possible combinations.
6050363	6051444	Of which 149,000 probably look like shit.
6056240	6056921	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6083871	6086318	Well, I think we have at least a couple listeners who are going.
6086639	6087903	I do believe so.
6087923	6090570	I've seen it around the Twitter, so I expect many pictures.
6091283	6108969	There's actually certain things that I would like to see, but one that actually I'm very interested in that's only going to be a video only for PlayStation 3 is the game that was the new game done by the creator of Katamari Damashii, which is Keita Takahashi.
6109049	6116112	It's called Nobi Nobi Boy, and really he just looks sort of green and cylindrical with the prince face.
6117512	6122234	It's like if they made the Prince of the Cosmos or whatever with a wiener dog.
6123355	6123895	I know, right?
6124735	6138441	But I would love for someone to get out a video camera and tape me some footage of that because there hasn't been anything really specific out on it yet except some people playing with something that looked like a dildo.
6139022	6144504	And I will send you a dollar if you dress up your wiener dog like Noby Noby Boy for Halloween.
6146372	6147474	One whole dollar?
6147534	6148134	One whole dollar.
6148875	6149976	That's pure U.S.
6150136	6151077	currency for you.
6151598	6155182	There's also another game there that I want someone to tape me footage of so I can see it.
6155862	6157604	And that's, um, don't laugh.
6158065	6160127	Anpanmanto Touch de Waku Waku Training.
6161388	6161948	What is that?
6162128	6162808	Anpanman.
6163668	6163949	Huh.
6164109	6165569	He's cute and made of bread.
6166089	6166469	Alright.
6166809	6169590	But this is some stuff that's actually going to be video only.
6170810	6175851	It's Nobi Nobi Boy, Galaga Legends for... I'm sorry, Legions for Xbox 360.
6176671	6184792	On Wii is One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Kotoba No Puzzle, Mojipitan Wii Deluxe, and Progolf for Saru.
6185092	6186113	Doesn't Saru mean monkey?
6186613	6186813	Anyway.
6188073	6197077	On DS, the video-only ones are Dr. Slump, Arale-chan, Dragon Ball Origins, and Anpanman To Touch, DewakuWaku Training.
6197157	6197997	Someone tape it for me.
6198877	6203479	We also have on PSP, Idle Master SP, Wandering Star, and Missing Moon.
6203900	6209162	PlayStation 2 is Super Robot Taisen Z, and PC, Legend of Galactic Heroes, which is pretty cool.
6209682	6212263	There are some playable things, though, things of interest.
6213666	6214166	Like what?
6214807	6217089	Like whatever happy dance collection is, I guess.
6217649	6218069	I don't know.
6218870	6220491	Soul Eater, Medusa's Conspiracy.
6221032	6223834	Soul Eater is a pretty freaking cool manga, what I've seen of it.
6224214	6228418	There's also, yes, Precure 5, Gogo, Zen and Shugo, Dream Carnival.
6230399	6234220	There's also some Tales of Hearts stuff going on.
6234640	6236841	I really do want to see Macross Ace Frontier.
6237641	6242222	And there's also Tales of the Radiant World Mythology 2.
6243182	6243982	Also on PSP.
6246763	6247183	Alrighty.
6248503	6248843	Well, cool.
6248964	6250444	What about Sega?
6252344	6253505	It's just listed by systems.
6253645	6254325	Oh, I'm sorry.
6254745	6255085	That's all right.
6256186	6261230	GameStop has now bought a brand new chain in France for $700 million, and they have gained 332 stores out of the deal.
6261270	6261610	And apparently...
6280497	6287520	I don't know, the two stores that they bought, I guess, the Gaming Guild and it's Navigators.
6288640	6289561	I guess those are a chain.
6290261	6294443	Oh, Micromania, I'm sorry, is the French company.
6295843	6299125	Micromania, never heard of them, but of course I don't live in France, so.
6301166	6302946	Isn't that kind of scary, though?
6303507	6307048	They're seriously trying to be like the McDonald's of fucking gaming.
6308736	6309877	Yeah, beware, kids.
6310818	6314100	You will be assimilated into the GameStop collective, apparently.
6314680	6315821	It's just a matter of time.
6317903	6324647	I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about GameStop taking over the world, it makes me a little bit angsty, especially for the independent shops out there.
6325208	6328290	And when I get angsty, we play the mean music and say mean things.
6342396	6344045	and Fuse of the Week time, DarkSakura.
6344962	6348223	F you to me for forgetting one of the stories that I had to do just a moment ago.
6349004	6351985	And F you to Rob for not actually telling me the story.
6352005	6353265	I tried to drop a hint.
6354245	6356226	Yeah, but I'm a little pissed off right now.
6356846	6357767	I'm a lot pissed off.
6358067	6358487	Why?
6358887	6363889	Because I need my... I hurt.
6364689	6364849	Aww.
6365709	6370251	So F you goes to my hip hurting like really, really freaking bad.
6371111	6372452	And F you to...
6374582	6375282	Stuff in general.
6376923	6377643	Damn that stuff.
6378123	6379783	I know, stuff just sucks.
6381124	6381424	Loki.
6381664	6390506	I feel like people that run red lights with their cars, I don't know, they think it's fun or something, or they just say forget it, you know.
6392006	6400368	Anyways, so yeah, there was a guy today, we're driving, and he just, you know, right turn on a red, and just kind of didn't even stop, just whoo!
6401365	6428535	I'm going and then he pulled right in front of me and went super slow just to add insult to injury and then there's numerous days where I see people just blowing through red lights well after they've turned red because they're in a hurry well good, I hope you murder somebody and end up in jail forever and sued for all the money that you have all few bucks of it and you rot in hell that's it
6430068	6433891	I want to say F you to the Italian dinner I had last night, which was not at Olive Garden.
6433911	6435832	I went to another place around here.
6436072	6439014	And man, I don't know what it was about the food.
6439074	6443197	It was bad or something because it's like World War III was occurring in my colon.
6443577	6445178	It was really, really horrible.
6445318	6446799	So F you to that.
6450020	6452502	I wonder if I ate uncooked meat or something.
6452522	6453602	It was pretty terrible.
6453822	6454883	I'm going to do my story now.
6454923	6456304	You sure can do your story now.
6457024	6460126	This is the list of stuff that Sega is going to have at Tokyo Game Show.
6461067	6465409	For PlayStation 3 is Yakuza 3, Bayonetta, Sonic Unleashed.
6465469	6470933	For Wii is 428, Bleach vs. Crusade, the arrangement of Haruhi Suzumiya, another Haruhi...
6471793	6472494	I like Haruhi.
6473014	6473594	That's really cool.
6474095	6495431	Sonic Unleashed, Samba de Amigo, Xbox 360, Bayonetta, Sonic Unleashed, DS, Mystery Dungeon, Children of Wonder, DS2, Demon Castle in the Desert, Phantasy Star Zero, which is going to be awesome, Infinite Space, Seventh Dragon, Shining Force Feather, that's another cool thing, Cold Deceptor DS, which actually someone IM'd me the other day saying, look, Cold Deceptor!
6495451	6496631	I'm like, I don't like tactics games.
6499273	6525101	There's the Haruhi game, Blazer Drive, World Destruction, Sakatsuku Dia's Touch and Direct, Kaete Oboeru Doragana, Garnet Chronicle, Crimson Gen, Saga on PSP, Hatsune Miku, Project Diva.
6525561	6526441	You know what that is, right?
6527752	6542625	Virtual Idol Nice Yep And Phantasy Star Portable And PC is getting Internet Adventure Internet Adventure The internet is an adventure It is an adventure Dude, that's okay I want the Hatsune Miku game I totally want the Hatsune Miku game
6543613	6543913	Alright.
6544653	6546454	Lots to look forward to at Tokyo Game Show.
6565800	6567682	And a follow-up to a story we had last week.
6567702	6570464	Remember how we talked about that the co-op was going to be delayed via a patch?
6570524	6577129	Well, suddenly there's some backtracking this week from the infamous Peter Molyneux, the Lionhead CEO.
6577189	6581192	He is saying that the co-op actually might be available at launch day.
6582152	6584354	So now they're kind of going back and forth.
6584434	6588397	But this was said in some video at a game festival that was going on in Paris.
6588978	6593481	He said that Fable 2 will have the online co-op at launch, but he can't confirm that.
6595540	6621532	But the ambition is there But just in case, be prepared for disappointment I'm not sure how exactly I'm supposed to take that It's only about a week of disappointment I know, it'll be all over within a week Which, quite frankly, I have enough games to play anyway I don't fucking need another one But I do still kind of want Fable 2, I gotta admit You need to play Saints Row 2 No, I don't Because you can make all sorts of tranny characters Oh, because that's why I play games, Loki To make tranny characters Exactly!
6621572	6622172	Who doesn't play games?
6622192	6623473	That was a sexist comment
6624332	6625572	How is that a sexist comment?
6625592	6630414	Tranny is both sexist.
6632035	6637256	Fable 2 is getting a collector's edition, but it's slowly slipping away.
6638257	6645199	Some of the cards that were supposed to be in it, the figure and all this stuff, the box itself is not actually going to be there.
6645279	6646179	Oh, but the cards will.
6646620	6647580	The cards will be there.
6648480	6649520	But here's the other weird thing.
6650301	6653922	The cards are going to be there in a downloadable PDF format.
6655259	6656880	So you can print your own damn cards.
6658622	6663346	I'm getting the feeling nobody pre-ordered the collector's edition and that's why they're suddenly having to do this.
6663426	6664126	I don't know what it is.
6664567	6664907	Did you?
6665727	6666088	Yeah.
6666468	6669551	How do you feel about the fact that it's suddenly like disappearing?
6669831	6672293	I didn't give a shit about the cards or the DVD or anything.
6672333	6673133	I just wanted like...
6673988	6674768	Thanks for watching!
6694203	6698584	No, I'm buying it now so I can play it after I'm done with Saints Row 2, which will be for a while.
6698844	6702565	My friend wants to play Fable 2 co-op, so that sounds kind of like fun.
6702945	6703365	That'll be fun.
6703745	6707546	But then again, I want to play Saints Row 2 co-op, so I don't know.
6708086	6710467	Henderson Ma'am says, I wanted the Master Chief outlet.
6710527	6712568	Is that the thing they're getting with the pre-order?
6712688	6714628	Yes, that comes with the pre-order still.
6714728	6718249	There's a lightsaber type of weapon or something that you get.
6718369	6722010	There's also some additional dungeon or something that's coming.
6724414	6724894	That's about it.
6724954	6727055	And you get like a bonus DVD of behind the scenes crap.
6727135	6730136	I kind of wanted the figurine for my desk and that would have been kind of cool.
6730456	6735398	I also have a regular version on order as well in case I decide at the last minute I don't want, you know.
6736059	6737459	Well, I have it on order at work.
6737519	6738880	I mean, I can cancel at any time.
6738920	6741080	There's no $5 deposit for me, so.
6741381	6742221	Cancel at any time.
6743208	6745250	Why don't you order like 50 of them and then cancel them all?
6745450	6746010	Or will they get mad?
6746150	6748932	They get mad at that.
6749192	6750933	Well, that is coming out soon.
6750973	6754696	Hey, speaking of the Master Chief outfit, completely random off-topic story.
6755196	6760379	I went to a party store here locally yesterday and you know everybody's gearing up for Halloween, right?
6760420	6763942	Did you know they're selling a Halo 3 branded Master Chief outfit?
6764322	6764922	Have you seen that?
6765043	6765803	I have seen that.
6766103	6768765	I was at party stores yesterday.
6768865	6769866	Do you know what's really sad?
6769906	6771286	Is I was considering buying it.
6771567	6772667	Because I'm kind of pathetic.
6772847	6774028	Well, it would be fun, wouldn't it?
6774608	6775829	Dress up as a video game character.
6776970	6779471	Especially one as well-known as Master Chief.
6779591	6779811	What?
6779991	6780331	Um, what?
6781512	6781632	Um?
6781712	6783113	You know tons of cosplayers.
6783133	6784014	You wouldn't have a problem.
6784094	6784434	True.
6785134	6786875	I could save that for an army convention.
6786975	6789677	Our manager in Dallas, he has a kick-ass Halo.
6789737	6792118	I think he actually bought one of those Halo costumes.
6792178	6793979	Like, a custom-made one or something.
6794740	6797101	He has, like, literally the full outfit.
6797423	6799824	Rob Chico is the king of the universe.
6800444	6802004	Oh, the king of the cosmos?
6802044	6802705	That'd be hilarious.
6802825	6806886	Actually, we're talking about doing that as a Rocky Horror Gold scene at some point, if you even know what I'm talking about.
6807906	6814388	Deekman in chat, live in our chatroom, chat.orangeonstranger.com says, I saw that at Walmart yesterday here in Canada.
6815689	6816709	So it's even at Walmart.
6817549	6819150	Dan's shadow is going to be Dr. Horrible.
6819830	6820690	That's a pretty good outfit.
6821471	6824072	You know what I'm hearing is going to be a really popular outfit this year, I heard?
6824752	6825252	Sarah Palin.
6828082	6829084	One of my friends is going to Sir.
6829725	6832250	Deakman says a lot of people won't cancel it regardless.
6832290	6833793	Going back to the pre-order, speaking of that.
6835339	6835739	There you go.
6837320	6838661	Alright, so Fable 2.
6839162	6839642	I'll buy it.
6839682	6842884	It'll just be one of those games I only have 30 minutes to play, so go figure.
6842944	6846166	Oh, Deekman says my wife is going as Grunty from Banjo-Kazooie.
6846386	6847367	You know what I saw?
6848007	6851770	Someone made a costume or at least a guide on how to make it.
6851970	6854092	They have a Sackboy costume that someone made.
6854792	6855953	Oh yeah, I saw that.
6855993	6857754	I think I might actually want to make that.
6858715	6863758	I don't have a costume to wear and my wife is dressing up as Darthina Vaderina.
6865599	6871344	and pink Barbie-ish secret girlfriend of Darth Vader.
6871824	6873766	She's going as an awful Mary Sue.
6873866	6883893	She's literally like, you know, she's dressing, or it kind of looks like her cape's going to be bedazzled and stuff like that.
6884054	6886575	It's ridiculous, but funny.
6886836	6889198	SSJ100 Matt says, I'm thinking of going as the Hebrew Hammer.
6890098	6890739	That would be funny.
6890759	6893541	We'll have to ask this question again on our Twitter or something right before Halloween.
6893661	6894182	You know what?
6894302	6894462	What?
6894602	6902549	If it wasn't so freaking hot to wear and didn't need to be taken in a bit, I'd wear my Organization XIII costume from YaliCon the other year.
6902749	6906893	I'm probably going to recycle my Jack Skellington costume from last year, because seriously, I paid good money for it.
6906933	6908013	I need to wear it more than once.
6908274	6912277	You know, I actually, though, I really want someone... I need to redo the claw.
6912337	6913578	I could do my Baiken costume.
6913838	6914039	Oh, fun.
6914079	6914639	Show off my boobs.
6915925	6916305	All right.
6916725	6918446	How about you show off the next gaming story?
6918766	6920626	How about I do just that?
6920666	6921287	You do it.
6923207	6927808	Well, for anyone who's been interested in The Force Unleashed, you're getting some treats.
6928489	6933010	You're getting Luke and Obi-Wan, which is pretty freaking cool.
6933030	6938131	You're also getting Ki-Adi-Mundi and Kit Fisto.
6938171	6939772	That sounds like a porn star name.
6939792	6940612	Yeah.
6941252	6942713	Kid Fisto!
6943993	6944553	Fisting.
6944594	6945034	Wow.
6946314	6947635	It's actually a pretty cool looking character.
6949416	6955498	But also, there's supposed to be new costumes and a new mission.
6956418	6961821	One for the Jedi Temple and the apprentice will learn more about his father, blah blah blah.
6963362	6964682	So you get more stuff.
6965743	6972626	There's no dates left for the download content packs, but it will be posted at some point, I guess.
6973807	6974407	Pretty game.
6975288	6977969	Yeah, the Sackboy costume looks really easy to make.
6978029	6981491	It's like a sweatshirt and a garbage bag, or a garbage pail.
6981571	6983172	You should wear a Kit Fisto costume.
6983948	6984748	and I'll see you next time.
7007395	7032598	so uh yeah apparently all that drama with uh EA trying to buy take two is made take to say hey you know what we're just gonna be a bachelor for a long time how about that so they've decided that they're not going to we need a little me time they're not gonna mate with any other game companies right now or merge with any they're not we're gonna return your phone calls
7033353	7034113	They're not calling you back.
7034154	7037115	They're like, you know... They just want the one night stand.
7037135	7039077	They're going to go, bye.
7039117	7039777	It's not you.
7039917	7040317	It's you.
7042259	7047302	They're like, you know, when they're getting up in the morning and whoever they're in bed with is saying, call me.
7047562	7048683	Take two is just like, sure.
7049323	7050184	I'll call you something.
7053809	7057272	Alright, well, too bad for those that were interested in Take-Two, I suppose.
7057352	7060374	But, you know, good for them, I guess, sticking to it if they want to stay independent.
7060895	7066299	Hey, on completely different news, this is a game, another, god, another freaking game I want to get this year.
7066319	7067400	I'm just not going to have time for it.
7067700	7068821	The Last Remnant.
7069501	7071543	The Last Remnant, you know, it's coming out worldwide.
7071643	7078969	Japan, of course, one place that they really need to sell more Xbox 360s, even though, you know, they've had a lot of good luck and some turnaround thanks to Tales of Vesperia.
7079369	7081431	They're gonna try to do that even more with The Last Remnant.
7081471	7085654	It's a special Xbox 360 bundle that's gonna be coming out in Japan.
7085754	7092639	This box is gonna come with a DVD remote, the game, a faceplate, and a soundtrack CD.
7092860	7095422	That's $331 for all that shit together.
7095462	7097984	It's about $30 off of what it would cost separately.
7098922	7103045	And they're hoping that's going to push them over the million Xbox 360 sold in Japan mark.
7103305	7104406	Because that's pretty big.
7105607	7108990	And again, Tales of Vesperia has been very good at helping them get there.
7109010	7111732	A little bit Infinite Undiscovery, too, as well.
7112473	7117517	The Last Remnant, by the way, though, is not solely on the Xbox 360.
7117557	7119999	It will be coming out on the PlayStation 3, but later.
7120399	7123121	So Xbox 360 does get a little bit of an exclusive window.
7123181	7123882	So there you go.
7124422	7125303	That's a lot of stuff, too.
7128220	7130481	So if you're waiting in Japan, now might be a good time.
7130981	7134382	Alright, now's a good time for us to go and open the email bag.
7134602	7142585	Every week you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick a few of our favorites to read here on the program and that's what we're going to do right now.
7142685	7145326	DarkSakura's going to dive in the mail bag and read some emails.
7145746	7146707	How many emails do we have tonight?
7147947	7148387	Five!
7149408	7149728	Alright.
7149748	7151388	Let's make it quick.
7151869	7152389	Five emails.
7152429	7152709	Here we go.
7153628	7155870	The first one comes from Daniel.
7156550	7159592	I swear this is going to be my last email regarding Warhammer Online.
7159652	7163335	I'm calling all MMO gamers to join the order on the Iron Fist server.
7164155	7174462	I'm trying to get a guild together, but because the hours I work 2pm until 11pm Monday through Saturday Thank you for telling us your hours, I will find out where you work.
7175263	7176383	It's becoming difficult.
7176924	7179946	I have a close group of experienced MMO gamers I'm going to stalk the Iron Fist.
7180928	7188674	on this server already, but we have all work similar hours, so none of us are in-game during peak hours.
7189114	7191956	The game really requires you to be in a guild to get some extra bonuses.
7192357	7192737	P.M.
7193638	7194338	Ballhair?
7196720	7197661	With three L's.
7197761	7206768	Okay, it's B-A-L-L-L-H-A-I-R
7210494	7228026	or PunkyDunch if interested I like how these guys are sending us an email about look we're on this roleplay server and we really want our guild to be taken seriously we can't figure out why people won't join our guild
7229287	7230467	and play this game with us.
7230847	7232308	Maybe it's our work hours.
7232488	7233108	I don't know.
7233768	7235848	Please send a message to Ball Air.
7238629	7240069	Rob is turning red in the face.
7240109	7240869	This is cute.
7245630	7245850	Rob.
7247171	7247431	Look.
7247731	7247931	Rob.
7248571	7248731	I'm not.
7249271	7249531	Rob.
7250851	7251471	Punky dunch.
7253132	7253952	That one's funny too.
7257097	7261560	Do you think that person might have just made this whole story up just to get us to say those names on here?
7261820	7265742	I think possibly that whole thing was a trap to get you to say ball hair.
7265822	7266283	You know what?
7266343	7267603	I'll say ball hair anyway.
7268804	7269705	Ball hair!
7271946	7273387	I'll also say sweaty balls.
7275808	7276149	Alright.
7277129	7278730	I am not afraid to go there, Rob.
7278970	7279791	Alright, I know.
7279851	7280351	You live there.
7280391	7281152	You own a house there.
7282110	7282550	P.S.
7282671	7284232	LittleBigPlanet is insane.
7284712	7288996	On the surface, it's a cute platformer, but once you dive into the level builder, you will be hooked.
7289877	7291078	It is difficult but addictive.
7291138	7294581	One of my favorite things about it is the ability to borrow someone's creations.
7295121	7299105	If someone else makes a really cool figure or building, you can borrow it and put it on your own stages.
7299545	7301427	Look on YouTube for some really cool creations.
7301527	7306051	The body level and LittleBigColossus are some of the more popular levels out there.
7308325	7309906	That's from Daniel, a.k.a.
7310227	7310707	Ball Hair.
7310787	7314470	Dan's in chat right now and says, no, it's real, I swear.
7314490	7317012	So you should sign all your letters, Ball Hair.
7317032	7318413	He is Ball Hair the Dwarf.
7318894	7319374	Ball Hair.
7319394	7320295	Come on, it's awesome.
7320695	7322517	No, dude, it is awesome.
7322597	7323497	That's the whole thing.
7323537	7324738	It's just really funny.
7324799	7325359	I'm sorry.
7325419	7327601	Just because the whole setup of the email and everything.
7328261	7330183	So we have to have fanfare for you.
7330543	7332165	Ball Hair the Dwarf.
7334568	7335229	Can I move on?
7335889	7336190	Yes.
7337211	7338172	Hi, folks!
7339253	7340695	I just had a few questions for you.
7340795	7345400	Maybe you might have some possible answers and slash or feedback.
7346301	7353429	Considering how retro gaming is on consoles nowadays, as well as indie games, see Everyday Shooter, Mega Man 9, X-Men, etc.
7353489	7354029	for reference.
7355010	7358151	I have decided to make my own games for both the 360 and PS3.
7358171	7367574	The catch is, the last game I made was a borderline pornographic mod of an Apple IIe edutainment game originally called Turtle Trot.
7368734	7373496	What classes should I take, or alternatively, what books should I read and what programming languages should I learn?
7373856	7376476	Are most games using the C languages or a variation thereof?
7376877	7377977	Dude, I have no fucking clue.
7379602	7381103	To actually learn how to write games?
7381123	7382144	You should write them in BASIC.
7382724	7386227	And release it on the TI computer.
7386287	7389169	Actually, that's not a bad point to email.
7389209	7393431	I'll tell you, when I was in school studying computer science, C++ was where you started.
7393752	7395593	It's one of those things where you have to start somewhere.
7395653	7399956	I mean, programming languages aren't that much different.
7400016	7400957	I mean, they are and they aren't.
7400977	7402778	The way you learn...
7403098	7403358	Shut up.
7403678	7409941	The way you learn languages is that whole logic, if, then, and building flowcharts in your mind.
7410301	7413043	And any language is going to be a foot in the door at that.
7413343	7419565	But if you want something to be practical and learn something, you go with C or the languages that are really out there.
7419846	7421766	Rob, I have to say something.
7421846	7422207	What's that?
7422527	7424628	Yeah, my flowchart is in my mind.
7427349	7427749	There you go.
7430030	7430971	As for the rest of the email?
7431611	7431771	Yes.
7432478	7437982	In case you're wondering, I'm looking to develop games that have the look and feel of old school 8 and 16-bit arcade and console games.
7438403	7447930	This catches that A, they're simple to pick up and learn, B, difficult to master, C, fun, and D, they have my goofy, corny, off-the-wall sense of humor injected into them.
7448490	7456096	An example would be an NPC in an adventure game complaining about being forced to pace back and forth in a certain path and saying the same thing over and over again to adventurers.
7456737	7461180	In a fit of rage or fed up, he declares that he quits and orders the gaming gods to take his job and shove it.
7463106	7464447	That came from Spazinator, by the way.
7466148	7468269	Wait, what was the question in there?
7468349	7471951	What games have that type of... That's what he said his goals for making the games.
7472131	7474053	Oh, I see.
7475233	7475593	I don't know.
7475673	7478455	Loki, you're probably the closest thing we have on staff to a programmer.
7478475	7479275	What are your thoughts on this?
7480636	7482857	For someone that doesn't program, I'm pretty good.
7483458	7485099	You hack and stuff, but I don't know.
7485819	7486880	Do you have any thoughts on this?
7486920	7487920	He hacks with a butter knife.
7488361	7488501	Um...
7489534	7497232	Well, I mean, if you're trying to get into it professionally, I guess, then, like, C would be good, or, like, Visual Basic or something like that.
7497773	7497893	Um...
7500097	7523332	probably if you're just doing it for fun and you want to do something like that there's like GameMaker 7 that I don't know if you've seen there was that Mario game that had like the Mega Man levels and all that like crazy shit in it that was made with GameMaker 7 so you can actually make full like games out of it and distribute them to your friends and that kind of thing and that's what you're interested in you know doing um
7525447	7526528	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
7526748	7527289	That's Bobby.
7527489	7528250	I don't know.
7528851	7529311	Good luck to you.
7529531	7530292	Pass off the blame.
7531033	7531553	Next email?
7531794	7532414	Yes, next email.
7532695	7534597	Hello cast of OLR, especially Loki.
7536004	7536464	DarkSakura, Loki,
7558121	7568706	If you have a Guitar Hero controller for PS2 and another system that's wired, you can get a converter that will allow you to plug in these controllers and play.
7569566	7578711	Lastly, if you decide to get this game, at first it sucks because the game itself has a lot of bugs, which makes it bad, and it looks nothing like Guitar Hero 3, but if you...
7579731	7583594	Get it, download the Elyrian mod because it's designed to make it look and feel just like Guitar Hero 3.
7583634	7588797	The best thing about this game is that you can add your own songs and download ones made by other people.
7588977	7597263	Lastly, all of the real gaming companies like Activision and Harmonix have released songpacks for each of their games that are exactly the same as the real ones.
7597703	7603787	That makes me laugh because Guitar Hero 3 is on PC, but you can just download the songs for Farts on Fire and play them for free, so please check it out.
7604007	7604688	This is from Blade 3.
7605288	7607609	P.S.
7609110	7610410	Sorry this email is so long.
7610450	7611170	Thanks for reading it.
7611190	7611630	P.S.S.
7611650	7613611	I hope I passed the grammar Nazis test.
7614191	7616112	No, you didn't because you didn't punctuate that sentence.
7616893	7619974	And the last one was a run-on sentence and also Nazis spelled N-A-Z-I.
7621134	7643836	um not with a t they also have a game called guitar fun on the wii that's basically the same thing and you can use that for like a homebrew stuff plus now the new version has usb support so you can use your usb guitars uh i think for rock band um and then you can also use usb keyboards if you want to um and that's also available and i think you can do two player on that you can also do uh
7645578	7645938	May I continue?
7670788	7672089	you may, I shall
7690407	7692269	Wait, is that the old, old-ass game?
7692289	7693250	It's the one I mentioned.
7693430	7694611	No, I mentioned this last week.
7694651	7696293	Yes, it's a remake of Pipe Dream.
7696373	7700336	Okay, I was going to say, that game is like... God, they had the game on the Commodore 64.
7700376	7702098	That shit is old school.
7702799	7703880	I mean, it's a very simple puzzle.
7703940	7704540	It's like Tetris.
7705121	7706842	It's also like Bioshock's hacking.
7707363	7708324	Ah, yes, yes, it is.
7710031	7711092	Well, to continue.
7711332	7711532	Sorry.
7713513	7716515	I'd never heard of the video game My Boyfriend, but it came out this week.
7716955	7726141	I'm sure it can't be as bad as Imagine Babies, or whatever horrible crime against grammar Ubisoft perpetrated against the English language while concocting the spelling of that game's name.
7726201	7727382	And yes, you did spell it correctly.
7729003	7735647	And regardless, the game is called My Boyfriend, and apparently the game lets the player, as a teenage girl, have her first boyfriend.
7736327	7737267	Now that I haven't heard of.
7737588	7741089	Maybe I can play as a boy and that would make it the most awesome game ever.
7742009	7748232	While your news is usually awesome and definitely entertaining to listen to, I just wanted to point out these two horrible omissions in your release sources.
7748672	7749772	Thanks, Hephaestus.
7750012	7755294	I mentioned Pipe Mania last time we did releases and yes, I did mention the exact same stuff.
7755334	7758856	It's a remake of Pipe Dream and it's the same thing as the hacking in it.
7758996	7761737	I remember specifically saying that because I have to sell this crap.
7761757	7765278	I think I kind of want to play that one though because it makes me think of Tokimeki Girlside.
7766192	7767292	Well, if you want to... Let's see.
7767332	7770974	If you want to... What other games are people going to accuse me of forgetting to mention?
7771034	7778796	Gravity, which is a game that's going to be coming out that's kind of like the... Was it Pocket Physics game that's out now?
7778856	7779776	Dude, that sounds cool.
7780717	7782617	There's also... I like physics.
7783057	7792480	There's also a crappy Rubik's World game that's coming out later on that's like Rubik's Cube stuff, but they're trying to make it expanded and it's going to be like a puzzle game and stuff.
7793641	7793781	Um...
7796158	7799319	I'm trying to think of what else that people might be remotely interested in.
7801199	7801500	I don't know.
7801620	7802560	I just mentioned everything.
7803560	7804200	I don't miss a thing.
7804861	7809842	A face that's in chat right now says, by the way, my boyfriend is totally a bad GTA clone.
7809982	7814063	I want to say there was a story about this a long, long time ago on the show.
7814083	7819825	The company that made my boyfriend apparently also made a PC game called So Blonde.
7821158	7821418	DarkSakura
7843251	7843911	And us now.
7844611	7847412	Because if you had moved out here, you would never have met me.
7847692	7851313	If not for my husband, I would never have been the internet celebrity I am today.
7851513	7851953	There you go.
7853394	7854774	Or as Actdeft calls him, Edan.
7855134	7857314	He facilitates my rock and roll lifestyle.
7858635	7859455	Or lack thereof.
7860335	7861195	So, last email?
7861275	7861996	Yes, last email.
7862356	7864056	Dear OLR, oh, we're dear.
7864876	7871078	I would just like to say that yesterday's show, the 28th, was my first time listening live while interacting with the chat room.
7871838	7872839	Thank you for watching!
7888892	7904555	if this gets read on air this statement needs to be made if you love the podcast and only listen via the podcast you're doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing all the OLR has to offer there's also some post show goodness to be found on occasion which is definitely also worth your time well thank you
7904795	7906677	God, you'd think we'd paid somebody to write that.
7906717	7907397	That's very sweet.
7907617	7909219	I know we didn't because we don't have any money.
7909679	7910400	Exactly.
7910700	7911701	We used that all up in Seattle.
7913142	7917125	At the risk of sounding like a complete suck-up, I'm going to end the email.
7919107	7926353	But first, I would just like to remind the OLR staff how awesome they are and reiterate that every listener should go to the chat room sometime.
7927014	7930036	I know I will be listening live and chatting every week that I'm able.
7930276	7932698	So here's hoping everyone listens live sonic
7933479	7934059	and Mediate.
7934559	7937480	By the way, I have to commend your spelling and your grammar.
7937981	7938841	It's beautiful.
7938961	7939941	It's freaking gorgeous.
7939961	7941162	Wow, a rare compliment.
7942062	7942862	Seriously.
7943062	7946284	See, that's how you get DarkSakura to kiss your ass is kiss her ass.
7946604	7948004	Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7948504	7952806	I actually, because, you know, I'm used to, and it's kind of hard.
7952866	7958148	I don't catch it so much in myself, but I catch it in other people's writing because I've gotten kind of used to being the beta reader.
7958968	7959508	But, wow.
7961289	7963170	This is actually very, very well done.
7963210	7963571	Thank you.
7963971	7966052	This is actually a good question in chat.
7966072	7968294	Whatever happened to the midday show for the European listeners?
7968334	7969134	We still need to do that.
7969775	7970355	At some point.
7971016	7973197	It's probably realistically not going to happen until after 300.
7975359	7983364	I don't know how much I want to get into this now until I know some details, but I'm going to be off for several shows in a row because I'm having surgery.
7983724	7985466	If you've been listening to the show, I just don't know when.
7985966	7987067	The when is the big question mark.
7987087	7988808	Bob's having a pancreactomy.
7989329	7990829	No, not, I, well, no.
7991230	7993610	And then he's having a duodenumectomy.
7993990	7996311	But if I get the gallbladder out, which is the surgery I'm having.
7996351	7997311	And then he's having a stomachectomy.
7997431	7997811	Shut up.
7998412	7999792	And I'm getting a face job.
8000432	8002753	But no, I'm going to have the gallbladder out, which is very common.
8002773	8004133	I'm sure plenty of our listeners have had it done.
8004173	8006354	I'm not that worried about it, except for the fact it's just surgery.
8006674	8010015	But, you know, there's going to be recovery time, and I have no OLR for me while I'm recovering.
8010055	8012676	So probably at least two, if not three weeks, I'm going to be out.
8013536	8015537	So I don't know what's going to happen to the show during that time.
8015557	8016757	The return of Pump Up the Volume.
8016977	8017898	Oh, Jesus Christ.
8018358	8020220	But, yeah, something will happen.
8020260	8021541	But I am not missing episode 300.
8021581	8027285	We will put this damn show on hiatus at 299 if I'm having the surgery in two weeks, which I don't think I am.
8028206	8029046	We'll figure out something.
8029086	8029767	Yeah, we'll figure something out.
8029787	8030147	We always do.
8030327	8033029	We'll bring the computer in to Rob's bedside.
8033310	8034651	Live from surgery.
8034691	8035751	Live from my bedroom.
8035772	8036672	There you go.
8037313	8039014	We'll put your surgery on Justin TV.
8039034	8043838	That would be just, it would be almost Shakespearean to have episode 300 from the hospital.
8046570	8048311	I don't know why.
8048531	8051972	We should totally, seriously, webcast your surgery.
8052972	8054592	I'm not Katie Couric, for fuck's sake.
8055092	8055373	Alright.
8055693	8057253	Seg says, need a guest host.
8057433	8059174	Well, we always want guests.
8059834	8060694	So come up, be on the show.
8060874	8062014	I think Bobby should fly out here.
8062575	8063675	Alright.
8063795	8065535	So that's the end of the segment tonight, yes?
8065875	8066396	For the mailbag?
8066736	8067076	Yes.
8067356	8070697	Alright, we want to thank our sponsor for tonight's... Let's fly Tiara back out here.
8070837	8073338	We want to thank tonight's sponsor for our mailbag segment.
8073358	8074578	Sauce is going to be our guest host.
8078550	8091524	Give it up for tonight's sponsor, everybody.
8092705	8094207	Oh, hair!
8094247	8095268	The dwarf!
8099692	8100173	I don't get it.
8101107	8102007	No, just kidding, I do get it.
8102027	8102508	Alright, good.
8102808	8104448	I was going to say, don't make me explain it to you.
8104929	8105989	Alright, let's move on.
8106029	8110551	A couple more gaming news stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and hopefully we'll get some calls.
8111471	8120655	So, there's plenty of ways to save money with your car insurance, but there may be a new way soon, especially if you're of the old variety.
8122095	8129178	Apparently, there is Allstate, and they're, I guess, testing a new...
8131041	8131281	DarkSakura,
8152595	8156517	Also kind of just different reflex tests and that kind of stuff.
8157017	8162039	And they're seeing if the performance in that game correlates to how safe the drivers are.
8162379	8168461	And if they find that to be true, then you may get discounts based on how well you perform in a game.
8169561	8170862	Or how often you play said game.
8171202	8173723	I hope they do the tests on Crazy Taxi.
8174503	8175584	Crazy Taxi.
8176004	8178205	I'm ready to save some crazy money.
8179805	8181586	That's like a future Geico commercial right there.
8184042	8186865	Wow, who knew some video games might actually save me money in the future?
8190488	8192130	Do you think this is really going to happen though?
8192210	8197455	Or is this like one of those things where like so-and-so says something to so-and-so and now it's like fact?
8197615	8200378	It's less of a game, more of like software.
8200518	8201919	I wouldn't even call it a game.
8204182	8204502	All right.
8205458	8209100	Hey, we are going to be opening the Skype line very soon to your calls.
8209120	8215945	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so you definitely should be adding us on there.
8216766	8225391	But first, we have one more story for you tonight about, what else, the most important video game of the 21st century.
8229194	8230715	Of course I mean SingStar ABBA.
8233467	8235348	It is being released on December 2nd.
8236669	8238411	And the track listings have been announced.
8238551	8242474	There are going to be 20 tracks on the PlayStation 2 for $30.
8243955	8246757	25 tracks on the PlayStation 3 for $40.
8248618	8250300	And yes, Dancing Queen's on both.
8252101	8254185	Some of the highlights from both track lists.
8254285	8263143	Chiquiquita, Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man After Midnight, Take A Chance On Me, SOS, Dancing Queen, Fernando, I Do I Do I Do,
8264557	8269579	Knowing Me, Knowing You, The Winner Takes It All, Mamma Mia, Money, Money, Money, and of course, Waterloo.
8269899	8275981	Some of the exclusives on the PlayStation 3 that you will not see on the PlayStation 2, if you were curious, I know I was.
8276441	8285584	Under Attack, When All Is Said And Done, which by the way is my favorite of the song ever, and Head Over Heels, and Happy New Year, and The Day Before You Came are the five.
8287887	8290709	So that goes out to all two of you that care about that news.
8290749	8293751	But I'm telling you, this game is going to be epic.
8294092	8294432	I care.
8294512	8295253	In so many ways.
8295333	8295933	I care too.
8297554	8298475	When's it coming out in the U.S.?
8298635	8299396	December 2nd.
8299696	8300657	You know what, Rob?
8301837	8303799	I might have to pick it up.
8304646	8305968	I'm going to pick it up.
8306228	8319680	My PlayStation 3, I told America, and the world, I told the world, not just America, we have listeners all over the world, I told the world, I will buy the PlayStation 3 when that one game comes out that I have to have.
8320621	8322023	And it is coming December 2nd.
8322403	8323364	It's not even Final Fantasy.
8323384	8324785	Well, and there's LittleBigPlanet too.
8324905	8326327	But there's SingStar ABBA.
8327054	8328195	I can't speak for DarkSakura
8348413	8350053	and I certainly can't speak for Loki.
8350414	8351094	Yes, you can.
8351434	8353274	And Loki says no.
8354335	8365377	But I will do a Justin TV special even if I have to get my fabulous friends over here to play the game with me like Extifer and Irene and Victoria and some of the fabulous friends.
8365477	8366538	Get me drunk enough, I'll do it.
8367935	8369236	Now, Deekman asks a good point.
8369296	8371798	Why can't these just be DLC for the current SingStar?
8371818	8373199	That actually isn't a bad question.
8373599	8377842	But something as momentous as ABBA deserves its own release.
8377902	8378403	Don't you think?
8378503	8379063	I mean, shit.
8379604	8395335	If a little podunk band like ACDC, a little band that nobody's heard of called Aerosmith, this no-name thing out of the Bay Area named Metallica, if they can all get their games, why can't ABBA have their own damn game?
8396516	8397557	I still have to give you your record.
8398936	8399396	Yes, you do.
8400177	8402659	When Ranma was here, he got Rob an ABBA album.
8402859	8403720	That's amazing, by the way.
8403740	8404561	Got him Super Trooper.
8404981	8405682	That's amazing.
8406222	8407563	That's what's going in the blank spot.
8409104	8409645	Pinball.
8409985	8410285	All right.
8410866	8411807	Maybe we'll just rearrange.
8411847	8414068	I mean, some of these, I mean, Poppin' Music 11.
8414109	8414689	How old is that?
8414949	8415450	That can come now.
8415470	8416350	But it's still cute.
8416410	8417171	You should give that to me.
8417812	8418652	The other one is Autograph.
8418672	8419913	You know this Dear Friends poster?
8419933	8422716	I don't know if it comes through on JustTV, but there's no Bowie Matsu's autograph right there.
8423316	8424197	That's something my friends got me.
8424821	8425682	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8451240	8452000	Something different.
8452020	8454741	I want everyone's opinion in the studio about this.
8455101	8460642	As some of you know, I go to cons and I sell hentai video games.
8461102	8469003	Now, we're thinking about changing the packaging design to make it look more like normal Wii, PS2, PS3 boxes.
8469683	8478845	I had said that I don't think that's a very good idea because we'd have to deal with the ESRB who would want the games rated and it would just go into a...
8479881	8480902	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8503857	8506119	Are you redistributing them from another person, or what is this?
8506179	8508280	I didn't know you wrote games, or what the hell is this?
8508780	8510941	We've redistributed them from a company called J-List.
8511322	8512042	Oh, okay, cool.
8512102	8512802	I know J-List.
8512842	8514263	I've ordered lots of snacks from them.
8515244	8518786	I think you're okay designing box art that's similar.
8519306	8523228	I mean, honestly, if you want good examples of parody, go to the porn industry.
8523608	8525930	That's kind of what you're going to have to do for these games.
8526030	8527331	You know... Hey, wait, hold on.
8527511	8527691	What?
8529132	8530454	Random porno fact here.
8530955	8534400	Did you remember that Not the Brady's thing that they had?
8534700	8536563	They have Not the Munsters now.
8537644	8539006	It's a porno Munsters movie.
8539026	8540768	We have in our house Not Another Porn Movie.
8541778	8542479	Oh, that's what we do now.
8569062	8585508	Yeah, so why not design, yeah, you could design something, come up with something unique, but you could certainly do something that's consistent across the hentai land so that, you know, when you see the purple border on the top of a certain shape or whatever, you know you're getting quality J-list hentai.
8585648	8588469	Now, why exactly are you redesigning the packaging in the first place?
8589508	8591690	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8610632	8616534	Design something consistent, like a purple bar along the top that's in a pixely art or something.
8616714	8620155	Do they have a name for the series?
8621835	8623416	Well, they're different hentai titles.
8623436	8624396	That's just it.
8624416	8625917	What's the name of a hentai title?
8626637	8630038	One of them is Almar's Professor Cherry.
8630058	8631578	That's one of the games that we sell.
8631918	8637860	Sexy Professor Series or something like that along the top in a pixely type art that makes me think of video games.
8640137	8647921	That could work, but I'm just more worried about the fact that expanding that the ESRB may be like, hey, you're selling PC games without our rating.
8648721	8650642	We don't want to deal with that.
8650742	8651583	You don't put their rating on it.
8651603	8652703	You're not making the games.
8652723	8653664	They don't give a shit.
8653684	8654704	And you're not big enough.
8654925	8655845	They're not going to notice.
8656145	8657546	That's what I said.
8657726	8662949	As long as it's very clear on the box, not for children, you'll be fine.
8664089	8666151	You gotta have it somewhere on the box, very clear.
8666611	8667672	Not for children.
8668032	8672935	Of course, if the box art is like a dick going in a pussy, I think that's gonna get the message across.
8672955	8674156	No, no, that's on the inside.
8674176	8675617	The actual DVD.
8676397	8678819	Are the fronts rather artistic?
8679539	8680700	Yes, they very artistic.
8682581	8683181	Hey, wait a minute.
8683582	8685323	We should get some of these games.
8685343	8689325	What they need to do is have embossed packaging, especially around the boobular area.
8689345	8689946	Yeah.
8689966	8690266	Yeah.
8691405	8693266	Well, I'll tell you guys what.
8693286	8696329	We do have some open copies I can send you guys in Sky.
8696449	8698050	I have some Yaoi titles for you.
8698070	8698370	Sweet!
8698390	8698750	Yes!
8700352	8702213	Look who's really excited about the Yaoi titles.
8702233	8702733	Did you hear that?
8703033	8704755	No, there's actually a couple I almost bought.
8705815	8706176	You know what?
8706476	8708237	Again... I'll review them for the show.
8708357	8709358	Ranma, here's my advice.
8709518	8710959	You can do the DVD packaging.
8711199	8713241	It's on a small enough scale I don't think they're going to care.
8713641	8716363	Don't flat out copy what the big boys are doing.
8716603	8718304	Come up with something similar.
8718364	8718865	Nothing like that.
8719045	8719225	Yeah.
8719585	8719846	Alright.
8720586	8720966	There you go.
8721067	8724049	And some of the chat room wants to see some of this art.
8745530	8746210	No!
8746290	8749412	Yeah, no, they're not going to want to carry it, but you might be able to get it in indie game stores.
8749552	8750533	You never know, with back rooms.
8750853	8752114	Hey, here's my thought, though.
8752234	8768662	Honestly, I know this is going to sound crazy, but go back in gaming's history and look at some of the box art that came out for games like Custer's Revenge, or even on the completely opposite end of the spectrum, go look at some of the box art for Bible Adventures and some of those games that came out on the NES, because those games were unauthorized, correct?
8768682	8769983	They were not official Nintendo products.
8770643	8770983	Correct.
8771264	8773845	And some of the Color Dreams games, you might find some inspiration.
8776547	8778867	Alright, well Ranma, we gotta let you go though, but good luck with the business.
8778887	8780588	You're doing a great thing for the community.
8781408	8782668	Oh, we definitely do.
8782688	8787269	Oh, and Rob, before I go, I know you and Jamie like Rumble Roses.
8787769	8790390	There is a porn version of that available.
8791230	8792650	It's called Ready to Rumble.
8792750	8794491	Is there a hentai podcast?
8795911	8796771	Probably.
8796991	8798872	I know my podcast gets a little bit hentai-ish.
8798892	8799592	Check the chat room.
8801951	8802231	You know what?
8802271	8802992	I think there is one.
8803032	8807333	I don't know if this guy listens anymore, but I remember way, way, way back in the day when we first, first started podcasting.
8807353	8808634	We were doing the to-go stuff, right?
8809034	8812755	There was a guy who ended up starting a hentai podcast because we got referrals from his site.
8813075	8813715	I remember that.
8814236	8821638	So there's at least a hentai podcast, but a hentai gaming podcast, that might be a niche that needs to be discovered, my friend.
8823099	8825780	Well, I might have to start reviewing them on my own podcast then, huh?
8825960	8826240	All right.
8826260	8826640	There you go.
8827854	8834259	Alright, we gotta let you go Ranma, have a good one buddy Thanks a lot, y'all have a good one You're a true American You know the company that made Custer's Revenge?
8834459	8834880	What, who?
8835260	8838142	I have a friend named Mystique Oh, Mystique Entertainment?
8838363	8840224	Yeah I met Mystique, right?
8840404	8851613	Yeah, the Amazonian girl Yes, she was nice Yeah, she is, she's great She's fun But the box is so funny It is very funny See, but it's shaped like a normal Atari box Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
8852974	8856677	Hi folks, this is a standing neighbor I'm sorry, what was your name again?
8857921	8858922	and Spazinator.
8859442	8860202	Spazinator!
8860242	8861483	What's on your mind, Spazinator?
8862964	8863825	Not much.
8863865	8870069	There was two questions I neglected to put into my email that I just thought of.
8871229	8885418	First off, considering that Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting and Samurai Shodown 2 are both available for Xbox Live Arcade, do you suppose there's any chance that
8886024	8897110	Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Samurai Shodown 4 Avacoustas will eventually come out for Xbox Live Arcade or no?
8897370	8899671	Where there is money to be made, they will make it.
8899731	8902252	But aren't they doing the Super Street Fighter 2 High Def thing?
8902332	8905234	That is coming out on Xbox Live, the Super Street Fighter 2 High Def Remix.
8905534	8906094	They're doing that.
8907075	8908936	I don't know about Samurai Shodown 4 so much, though.
8908956	8910296	It really depends on how the other one sells.
8910577	8911077	That's what it is.
8912392	8940907	yeah well honestly if you ask me I think that at least with the samurai showdown series the fourth game is probably the best in the series if you ask me but that's just one person's opinion but you know what else is selling though are those compilations and you never know one of those is probably going to come out at some point for xbox 360 because they have them on playstation 2 why not there's people that buy that stuff like candy so you know even if it doesn't show up on arcade you'll probably see it in a compilation down the line
8944533	8945254	What was the other question?
8946934	8968766	Now, considering that sometime next year in the United States to come out with the DSi, these polls that for someone that only got the DS Lite within the past few months and really only got it for certain third-party games like
8969710	8973293	The Final Fantasy Remakes, The Genealogy Wars and what not.
8973313	8982681	Do you suppose there's any good reason for someone to upgrade to the DSi or should we just stick to the DS Lite?
8984451	8985351	Well, this is interesting.
8985532	8995516	Systems like the DSi are kind of starting to blur the line of our golden rule of gaming, and we've said this a million times on the show, but the golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
8996177	9002840	So if there are games that are going to take advantage of the DSi's features that you absolutely have to have the DSi for...
9003480	9004080	Thanks for watching!
9024608	9025610	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9039810	9040431	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
9055531	9057512	or do I already have what I really want on my iPhone?
9057932	9061233	I don't think we know enough about the system yet to really answer these questions.
9061313	9067795	I think there's definitely the oohs and ahs factors going on there, but the problem is the camera, we've seen it before.
9068215	9070476	The downloadable content, we've seen it before.
9070956	9074518	Everything they're putting into the DSi, we've seen before, we just haven't seen Nintendo do it.
9075138	9079439	So the question is, how is Nintendo going to do this and make it their own?
9079699	9081620	And I think that's really what has to be demonstrated.
9082240	9083681	Anybody have anything else they want to add to that?
9083701	9084701	I don't know.
9084929	9092216	Yeah, not to go poo-pooing on Nintendo or anything, but... Oh, why not?
9092256	9093337	I was poo-pooing on them earlier.
9093397	9106630	I kind of got away from Nintendo over the past 10 years, simply because, at least with the F64, they have had not too great of a game lineup.
9106710	9110053	They have a handful of games, but...
9111441	9114104	It's not overly great.
9114344	9121591	It goes with the GameCube and even to a certain extent, even the Wii.
9122372	9129419	I mean, yeah, the Wii is good for like the retro games and whatnot, but aside from that, I don't think it's useful.
9130404	9131465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9156998	9160861	We're probably like a year or two away from hearing something like that, and it's going to be the same question.
9160901	9165825	Do I really need to get one the first day, or does that game I have to have, is that a ways out?
9166766	9167046	You know?
9167287	9184541	Yeah, ironically, I think I heard either on Tech of the Show or X-Play within the past couple days that Nintendo's actually, you know, has formally announced or leaked some information about, you know,
9185410	9188631	You know, like a Wii 2 or Wii HD.
9188811	9190032	It was actually a dork.
9190172	9193053	It was some dude that quit EGM and 1UP or whatever.
9193093	9195033	He's a former editor that made that comment.
9195073	9198195	And to be honest, that type of rumor shows up every six months.
9198315	9199875	I mean, let's face reality.
9200255	9202556	Will Nintendo make another video game system?
9202936	9203857	Fuck yes, they will.
9204117	9205717	They've done extremely well with Wii.
9206097	9207858	Yes, they're going to make another video game system.
9208298	9210559	Will Nintendo make the system backwards compatible?
9211059	9211799	Yes, they will.
9211859	9215621	It was a big selling point of the Wii was the fact that they had all the GameCube games available.
9215981	9220844	So the fact that there will be another video game system from Nintendo is not news.
9221244	9221944	It's really not.
9222485	9231249	I don't know why all these... There will be another, whether they call it Wii or Wii 2 or, you know, Turkey Butt.
9231369	9232849	It doesn't matter what they call it.
9233010	9233950	I vote Turkey Butt.
9235231	9238572	There will be some new Nintendo system.
9238712	9240113	Turkey Butt, the game system.
9241273	9242834	But hey, we all laughed at Wii.
9245055	9247517	Dude, there's a new Mario game coming out on Turkey Butt.
9250939	9251319	There you go.
9251379	9256702	Honestly, I still give Nintendo a whole lot of crap about Wii.
9256882	9265967	It sounds like you're telling someone they're about to use the restroom or you're trying to speak French or something.
9266527	9267488	Maybe both, I don't know.
9269034	9269274	Right.
9269654	9272856	Well, Spazinator, good luck in your quest for the DSi.
9272936	9273296	You know what?
9273476	9274577	You don't have to decide right now.
9274597	9275877	We're not getting it for a year anyway.
9276078	9282000	Honestly, I would not import them unless, like, I had no digital camera or, you know, I don't know.
9282020	9283521	But then again, Loki's really big on the whole.
9283601	9286783	I want to exploit that SD card best I can, so maybe I can see that angle too.
9287083	9288103	But I'm lazy too.
9288123	9289624	You have a lot of time to decide this.
9289904	9290725	So good luck to you.
9290965	9293286	We'll keep bringing you the updates so I know what games are going to release.
9293546	9294106	So take care, buddy.
9295967	9296247	All right.
9296267	9296447	You too.
9296467	9296928	Thanks for the call.
9297028	9297268	Bye-bye.
9298322	9302232	Alright, let's take another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9303314	9306723	This will be the one and only Dark Knight Hey Dark Knight, what's on your mind, my friend?
9306743	9306883	Hello
9308021	9314185	I'm talking about the DSi thing, talking about the innovation, and I remember you made a mistake earlier calling the DSi phone.
9314626	9318068	Watch it probably end up being the next thing they'll probably do down the line.
9318108	9320029	Well, it's just a matter of time.
9321090	9323232	Tons of fucking people own a DS.
9323392	9324092	I mean, really.
9324553	9329556	I mean, I remember back in the day you were kind of a nerd if you had the old school Game Boy brick or whatever.
9329596	9330697	Very few people had those.
9330937	9331317	I know.
9331337	9332258	The God Matrix one.
9332618	9340045	We were sitting in a plane coming back from Penny Arcade Expo and I looked across the aisle and there was an old lady with gray hair playing her DS.
9340345	9346191	And I think that shows you just what a long way gaming has come in handheld gaming in so many years.
9346831	9349294	It's funny though when you think about it though.
9350509	9358614	You know, and really a more appropriate pun would be a DSi Touch is really what this thing is kind of to me because it's going to have like little calendars and all sorts of things.
9358994	9359395	And you know what?
9359695	9360755	It might be kind of cool.
9360835	9366639	Like I said, I'm going to get one, but it's just I joke because it's kind of like, well, I feel like we've kind of seen this all before.
9366719	9369321	How is Nintendo going to make this special?
9371198	9374621	Should we go through the history list of the Game Boy again like I did the previous night?
9376963	9379406	I mean, so many sad things they did to it and whatnot.
9379466	9386032	You can go all the way back from the dot matrix Game Boy to Game Boy Color, Game Boy Microphone.
9386452	9387033	Game Boy, um...
9405248	9405468	Right?
9405748	9409029	Like they were showing off the headset and I think they do have the headset.
9409049	9411910	They're not quite as on board as the PSP is with Skype and everything.
9412250	9412970	But what do you want to bet?
9413251	9418752	Nintendo could Nintendo-fy the entire way we think about VOIP.
9418852	9422714	And when I say that, I mean make it disgustingly simple so that even grandma can use it.
9423354	9425174	That's how they're going to get into the phone industry.
9425815	9428275	Well, think about this though.
9429016	9433317	In the homebrew community, somebody actually already did that a while back.
9434329	9437331	Yeah, the grandma on the airplane doesn't know that.
9438291	9439632	Yeah, not many people don't know that.
9440113	9442434	There's one that somebody already made like a little what?
9442874	9446236	Like a little V over IP thing in the homebrew community already.
9446556	9450419	It's just that not many people don't know about it nor have the equipment to do so.
9451403	9452804	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9470851	9472293	That might be kind of neat.
9472593	9474315	Yeah, that would be a killer vibe.
9474335	9476438	That would be kind of neat, but that will never happen.
9477299	9482205	As hard of a time as we give Nintendo, they might actually be sitting on Genius.
9482785	9484828	It's just a matter of, will they do it?
9485882	9487043	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9503740	9505300	DarkNight specifically, are you going to get the DSi?
9526593	9532556	I'm probably going to pass on it because I'm basically going to be like... I'll wait for it when a graphical change hits the DS.
9532656	9536359	I'm not going to... I mean, innovation alone is not really going to wow me this much.
9536399	9539340	I'm still happy with my DS fat.
9539380	9540141	Yeah, exactly.
9540321	9543123	I mean, why did we even really need to upgrade to the light in the first place?
9543443	9546124	Although I did, so it's hard for me to talk.
9546905	9549727	I told him, I said... I was telling some people tonight, I said...
9550569	9553911	If the DS were to have a slight graphical upgrade, I may jump on it.
9553951	9558394	But right now, the DS, I just basically like niche stuff and whatnot.
9558434	9560215	I don't need all that niche stuff right now.
9560235	9560756	I really don't.
9561036	9563117	It's not really worth it.
9563618	9563898	All right.
9564098	9566219	Well, any other thoughts tonight, Dark Knight, before we let you go?
9566239	9567500	We want to try to get one.
9569577	9574259	I had so many thoughts, but I left my brain, but I'll be discussing it next week when I do my thing.
9574919	9576260	Alright, it's all good, Dark Knight.
9576500	9577300	You have a good night, okay?
9577480	9578121	And thanks for calling.
9578801	9579541	Yeah, you do the same.
9579581	9580121	Take care, guys.
9580181	9581042	Talk Nintendo with us.
9581062	9581482	Have a good one.
9583003	9585083	Alright, we'll take one more call.
9585103	9590886	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9591666	9596148	And you can talk about Nintendo, or you can talk about Tokyo Game Show, you can talk about SingStar ABBA.
9598146	9598647	Orange Lounge Radio
9619551	9625377	Well, basically about the ACDC track pack Walmart is going to sell.
9625937	9626137	Yes.
9626738	9635426	I'm thinking that maybe Harmonix and EA in this case are taking the steps of Activision and...
9636687	9642309	What they're doing with Guitar Hero, you know, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, and next year, Guitar Hero Metallica.
9642329	9644369	Maybe they're going the same steps.
9645070	9649951	Though, I'm thinking that they are doing the wrong thing with it.
9650311	9651592	I think they should have...
9652712	9671937	maybe release the disc itself but also made it download content and maybe offer it for a cheaper price because $30 for 20 or so songs, for me, I think it's expensive even though it's a new game.
9672697	9673377	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9695330	9698532	Look at how much I am freaking obsessed over seeing Star ABBA.
9698592	9701694	Half of it is in jest, but the other half really isn't.
9701995	9703315	I freaking love ABBA.
9703335	9705117	They're the best band out of the 70s.
9705177	9710020	Call me the biggest gay or whatever you want, but I will buy this game because it's awesome.
9710320	9713182	There are people like that out there for ACDC.
9713562	9717825	The question is, how much are going to put $40 out there to get this game?
9718145	9725050	And if this sells even remotely well, the floodgates are going to burst open next year and you are going to see this kind of stuff.
9725470	9727472	for 10 bands next year.
9728773	9732777	I mean, if they can make that much money off of it, this is where music is going.
9733097	9750274	Yeah, that's why I'm worrying because if it sells, and I know it will sell because there are a lot of ACDC fans, but maybe they could offer the same thing
9751209	9755572	just on the Xbox Live Marketplace or on the PlayStation Network.
9756432	9765177	And we made it also downloadable because not everyone is a fan of ACDC, but some of them like their songs.
9767679	9770180	Maybe the same thing you could say with ABBA.
9771041	9779706	Like someone said on chat earlier, you could make the songs downloadable content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3, but there aren't.
9781914	9782694	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9804645	9813846	with you know monies and shirts and everything these are not the people that want their songs going two dollars a pop i mean they probably want to go all in with this stuff you know what i mean
9816002	9820745	They don't want their song thrown in as an afterthought in the game.
9821065	9823626	They want an experience built around their band.
9823686	9825267	You know this is how they're selling it to them.
9825547	9838474	When they sit down at the table with ABBA, with ACDC, they're sitting there saying, we want to make this game a whole new way to experience your band and your music and the brand you built.
9838494	9839475	Just feeding the ego.
9841912	9842773	Yeah, that's true.
9843613	9855221	But still, I think they could offer the disc for all the fans because I know there are going to be people that are going to buy it just because it's ACDC.
9856722	9861445	Like I said, and even you, you're going to buy the disc because it's up.
9862065	9867229	If they make a Deftones track pack, I know I'm going to buy it because I'm a big Deftones fan.
9867769	9870691	But still, they could offer
9871691	9876153	The same thing for a cheaper price, at least.
9876834	9880875	I would buy the ACDC pack for $30, at least.
9881536	9885878	It's going to be a separate game.
9886318	9889359	It's going to have its own achievements and everything.
9890660	9891220	Think about this.
9891420	9892381	Here's what it is.
9893755	9895636	I bet you this is it.
9895876	9898177	Look at the time of year this game is coming out too.
9898818	9903220	It's really hard to buy someone download content as a present.
9904021	9909864	But if you're Grandma and you're walking in the aisles of Walmart and you know little Timmy loves ACDC...
9911258	9913441	What do you think you might end up buying him as a present?
9913481	9915705	Because you know he loves ACDC, you know he loves Rock Band.
9916426	9918168	That's a huge factor in this.
9918228	9919089	Don't discount that.
9919470	9927181	Grandma's less likely to pick up the point cards than she is to pick up ACDC Rock Band track pack as a present.
9929779	9931400	Something to think about.
9931440	9931740	I don't know.
9931940	9933601	All these are things to consider.
9933981	9934761	They definitely all are.
9936342	9942705	Blackwolf wants to point out also the ACDC pack is cheaper as a track pack than it would if it were separate.
9942745	9944265	It's $30 as a track pack.
9944645	9948507	It's $35 if each song was available for $2 a pop individually.
9949567	9952028	But again, I think they're catering to the impulse buys.
9952889	9953429	That's what they are.
9954093	9959024	Yeah, the 360 and the PlayStation 3 version is going to sell for $39.99, so $40 exactly.
9963338	9979850	It's still a little bit expensive, especially because of people that download songs and maybe have a particular song they like and they would like to play.
9979930	9984654	But still, they would have to buy the $30 disc and just for one song.
9985583	10000889	And here's the thing, too, is if you have a friend that, say, likes ECDC and doesn't really necessarily have Rock Band or doesn't really care about dumping the songs onto his hard drive, you could dump them on your own hard drive and then maybe go in half with him for the actual game.
10001289	10003590	I don't think there's enough people that are going to think about that.
10004770	10012113	All right, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for your call, and hey, I'll be crossing my fingers for the Deftones game for you, okay?
10013694	10013994	Thanks.
10014134	10014814	All right, take care, buddy.
10016534	10017534	Quick comments from chat, though.
10017554	10019055	We're going to wrap up for the Skype line tonight.
10019095	10021595	Sorry to those who didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up the show here.
10022276	10023396	Reading some comments from chat.
10024196	10024696	I like this.
10024876	10027697	Redertainment says, Grandma is not likely to pick up a game anyway.
10028237	10029558	For herself, no.
10030238	10037100	But if your grandma does buy ACDC Rock Band for herself, you do have the coolest fucking grandma in the world.
10037200	10041661	My grandmother drove me all over Mobile trying to find Killer Instinct when it came out.
10041921	10042281	Awesome.
10043021	10043622	That is very awesome.
10043642	10045102	I do have the coolest grandmother in the world.
10045362	10050145	I don't, but I think Grandma might buy it for, I don't, you know, I use Grandma loosely, you know what I mean?
10050185	10054788	Like, you know, a friend trying to, or a relative trying to buy it for, you know, but you know what I mean?
10054808	10056129	I still have the coolest grandmother in the world.
10056149	10061313	And nobody said that it wasn't exclusive, you know, permanently for Walmart.
10061813	10067177	I mean, seriously, I have a feeling that maybe it will come out as download content later on.
10067997	10068497	That's true.
10069298	10070619	Wherever they can sell it, they will.
10072209	10075091	Grandma is person buying a game for other people, says Seg.
10075191	10077192	That's the point.
10077312	10077692	You got it.
10078733	10079734	Alright, that's it.
10079794	10080534	We're going to wrap up.
10081154	10081815	It's another show.
10081855	10082295	We're done.
10082355	10083015	We're out of here.
10083075	10085617	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10086117	10088399	And we will start off with Loki, your final thought tonight.
10089139	10094802	My final thought is I have a game that I'm going to be playing a lot of and you'll see some of that very soon.
10095303	10095563	Alright.
10095803	10097284	I never ask for any last minute stories.
10097304	10098404	I have a last minute story.
10098484	10099605	Okay, some quick headlines.
10099645	10099965	I'm sorry.
10100546	10100946	Dark Sakura.
10101970	10121404	for anyone who actually is interested in playing on the international Ragnarok Online server they have a free server up it's called Valkyrie and you've got a couple of detriments to playing on it but really it's good if you want to get into the official Ragnarok Online community and I'll link a page in the chat room alright, very cool
10122942	10126545	PopCap is releasing Bejeweled Twist in October.
10126625	10128266	I told my wife and she didn't give a shit.
10128907	10130348	Apparently she's over Bejeweled now.
10130628	10130968	I don't know.
10131508	10131989	It's weird.
10132449	10134591	But it's supposed to add some new features to it.
10134931	10138373	No word on what those features are yet, but something that has to do with probably twisting, I'm guessing.
10139995	10151203	The PSP 5.0 firmware is out there in testing phase right now, and it is going to add the Wi-Fi store and also allow you to do screen captures.
10151863	10157673	which are currently available in the not so official homebrew firmwares right now.
10158774	10166026	And no word on when that's going to be coming, but hopefully, probably sometime in October.
10167784	10176406	Finally, it's rumored that Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood is becoming Rock Band download content on October 14th.
10176466	10184367	This actually comes from a post on iMeme.com where they are doing a giveaway of Motley Crue's albums.
10184547	10189728	They also mentioned that Dr. Feelgood will be coming as download content on Rock Band starting October 24th.
10194835	10195415	Taiko no Tachigen
10214386	10215566	or 7,980 yen.
10216306	10221388	And the drums also can be purchased separately for 3,990 yen or approximately $38.
10221788	10226709	And of course the game will be out in Japan on the Wii December 12th.
10227950	10228370	It's kind of neat.
10230859	10237065	So since I kind of derailed your other thought, do you now have a final thought now that we've gotten all the last-minute stories taken care of?
10237225	10237365	No.
10237946	10238246	All right.
10239367	10244232	My final thought is I hear they're opening a Pinkberry in the Bay Area, and I want to go because it's good.
10245233	10246153	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10252019	10252379	All right.
10253701	10255162	Hey, knock it off.
10255722	10255963	All right.
10256812	10258013	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10284590	10295290	and it helps spread the word because the more 5 star reviews we get the higher we get in the rankings so please leave us some more nice reviews on iTunes you guys are awesome for that and one other quick thing before we head out tonight
10296147	10298048	One other very, very quick thing before we head out tonight.
10298868	10305410	As I understand it, two of OLR's listeners, Deke Mann and Kiki Nico, I don't know if you know, but last year they had a baby.
10306330	10308811	One year ago, they had a baby, Kylie.
10309211	10312892	And Kylie is turning one year old this week.
10313272	10316913	So we want to say happy birthday to Kylie on baby's first birthday.
10316953	10321455	You know, I was going to say, because I don't have any, I'm not going to sing happy birthday because I don't sing.
10321775	10322755	I will give you a little bit of this.
10329991	10331272	Happy birthday to baby Kylie.
10332732	10334913	And also happy birthday to Kylie Minogue whenever her birthday is.
10334933	10336394	Sorry, I had one last story.
10336434	10337374	No, the show's over.
10337414	10338275	No, one more.
10339035	10339735	This is kind of cool.
10339775	10340036	Okay.
10340176	10340436	All right.
10340456	10343537	Bungie's bringing out a video renderer soon to Halo 3.
10344298	10355803	So they'll actually have an option for those who subscribe to the Bungie Pro where you'll be able to actually export videos made in Halo to Windows Media Format.
10356584	10358545	for whatever you may want to use that for.
10359106	10360146	Okay, that is kind of cool.
10360427	10360587	Yeah.
10360967	10364849	But not nearly as awesome as Kylo Minogue.
