166000	169000	Oh, I'm sorry. What? Is it something in the air? What you ate?
169000	172000	It's probably allergies or an extra.
172000	173000	That's too bad.
173000	174000	That's usually the one of the two.
174000	177000	Does that have to do with the seasons changing? Because I'll tell you, like overnight.
177000	182460	I know you're only supposed to talk about the weather when you're bored, but here in the OLR headquarters of Sacramento, California
182460	186800	it's been scorching hot and then last week it starts raining and like the the
187800	189800	Climate has completely changed
191200	196620	Allergies have been hitting me a little bit harder lately, but not as hard as they're going to just
197460	202320	You know cuz they're raining and got dry again and kind of warm again. So you get a lot of mold
202320	204080	You know that means though, right?
204080	208400	You get an old ball. No. All right enough weather chat

228280	233300	297 we're gonna start it off as we always do talking a little bit about our gaming weeks dark soccer
233300	235300	I'll start off with you. How was your gaming week?
235560	241520	My gaming week was a lot of Ragnarok as usual addict. Hey
242780	246800	Okay, mr. World of Warcraft. Hey, what was the last time I said on this show? I played World of Warcraft
246800	248800	When's the last time you actually did?
248880	250880	today, okay
251800	257120	But wait a minute, wait, wait a minute yesterday was the first time in like three weeks, so give me a break
257120	259120	I also watched game shows
259120	261120	Awesome, namely the VP debate
261120	268480	Mm-hmm who wants to be a vice president? Yeah, I don't know. I actually I I won't get into it, but I actually was
269640	276000	Moderately disappointed in one party and moderately impressed by the other party even though I thought they both were kind of I will say this
276080	276720	You know
276720	280340	We'd like to keep our eyes on gaming blogs around the internet and the things they're reporting and of course
280340	283120	I'm sure you guys have talked about or I'm sure you guys have heard about Kotaku
283420	287920	They just ran a story that's towards the top of their feet. It looks like it got pushed at five o'clock today
287920	295220	Sarah Palin in video games and if you haven't seen this article, I'm gonna link it to you guys here in chat and you know
295800	297520	Democrat Republican
297520	299120	Independent I don't care who you are
299120	303720	You've probably seen the jokes about Sarah Palin and hopefully no matter where you stand
303720	307520	I'm not full of nanomachines. You have a sense of humor about it. Look at this
307520	309920	They'd like put her face on all these different
310440	313800	famous video game shots like there's like Tomb Raider Sarah and
313800	320440	And here's Metroid Sarah is the Metroid one actually looks cool and Cortana. Yeah, actually, they're not bad
320440	326180	The Photoshop jobs are actually pretty good. I got to say my favorite one though is uh, you know that one move every zig
326180	332600	Right there from God. What the hell was the game that game all your base are belong to us zero wings. You're wing. Thank you. Oh
333680	335840	My god, that's great. Very nice. I
336720	338720	like Alaskan Avengers
339160	340120	So you can check that out
340120	343800	It looks like it's on Kotaku, but I think it originally comes from a site called pwn or die
344520	349400	Something like that. There you have it. Get your politics on. Hey, no matter where you are, though
349400	351400	Just just vote freaking vote
351520	357440	Play photo the same as one. In fact, I'm feeling politically inspired today because I'm wearing my ECA shirt here
357440	359300	Only the Justin TV folks can see it
359300	360320	I was showing it off earlier
360320	364520	But we have a Justin TV feed that tapes our show even though we're a radio show and not a TV show
364520	366640	So, I don't know why we do it, but the listeners wanted it
366640	371760	So he said all right, if if you want but it's got little controllers on it and it says I got this at PAX
371760	378520	Thanks to Jamie. I'm batting her eyelashes at the ECA booth. It says contrary to popular opinion. These do not make me a killer
380720	385400	How's that because it's supposed to get $5 off because I have my student ID only I didn't have my student ID
385400	389560	And I was like, well crap I could prove I go to school. I have some homework on me
389800	393560	Nice, and so they just gave me another shirt and I paid the full price cool
393560	398800	So Jamie sweet talked her way to my t-shirt. Awesome. All right, so I know how to haggle
401760	404160	What I got some guitar here
404160	408560	I'm not sure here what played um rock band rock band the first one. Mm-hmm because
409080	411840	We had to have get our Jimmy Buffett on this week
412640	417040	And I'll tell you Jimmy Buffett songs are really great when you're out of your brain on Vicodin
417040	422700	Music in general, uh, you know, where do you think drug culture started?
423520	429280	At probably at a Jimmy Buffett concert, but I have to say there's another video and well not really video
429280	435600	But another game related thing going on. What's that my school life? I'm working on an objects in space
436400	441560	Project as in basically just stuff, you know hanging out in open space and whatever and I'm doing a pinball machine
441560	446640	Oh for my art class and my teachers thought it was quite you're gonna take pictures and blog it
446640	449900	Actually, I put it on your Twitter. I'm going to make prints of it
450200	454880	Okay, if it doesn't turn out like utter crap like I feel it will but we still have the space
454880	456800	I've been too lazy on Justin TV
456800	460800	I'm pointing to the space where I kept saying I was gonna get the GameStop whiteboard
461240	464320	Things that what was the things that suck about GameStop or something that we were gonna do
464640	468080	And we saw the space so we could have a picture of it
468080	475040	my husband's told me in no uncertain terms that I have to to have it preserved forever, so I
475040	479320	Figured I'm you know, cuz that's gonna do something for a pinball room. Mm-hmm
479320	485980	So I figured you know, I could do it for the pinball room get a grade for it and maybe people might like it
485980	491120	I don't know. There you go. They just might so alright, so getting a little bit arts
491120	494320	Maybe you could show it in a future video game related art show. Who knows?
494320	498800	I don't think it'd be that good Rob. Oh, you never know. All right, uh Loki. How was your gaming week?
498800	501400	I game week was alright. I played of course
501400	507080	Saints Row in the first one quite a bit because lives been fucked up
507480	511600	For a few days finally started working again around like Wednesday Thursday
512360	519040	But yeah, we were playing some Saints Row multiplayer because it can do system link and you know couldn't play Grand Theft Auto
520040	526840	Then when it started working played more Grand Theft Auto multiplayer because that game is awesome. I actually went back to play some Earth Defense Force
526840	528840	Uh
529560	530920	2017 and
530920	533040	God that game is still very hard
533680	539000	Still very very very chance of an Earth Defense Force 2018 someday. No
541120	544000	Let's see, what else did I play? Oh, I also played
544800	550080	Mercenaries 2 some more did another co-op session with my friend and that was pretty fun
550080	557640	And then of course, you know the the big one I've been playing this week Saints Row 2. Oh my god. This game is awesome
559120	562520	Seriously if you're gonna compare, you know Saints Row 2
563800	568320	to Grand Theft Auto 4, I think the real thing that kind of stands out is
569000	572240	This game is a lot more fun. I guess it's
573800	576860	Right from the get-go very over-the-top very
576860	580700	Just fun to play so it's it's can't be fun
580700	585780	It is kind of can't be fun, but like I'm playing right now through one of the gang missions
586260	590980	through the Brotherhood, which is one of the three will technically four gangs in the game and
591940	597180	It just keeps getting more fucked up as you play it. I mean, I don't want to spoil anything but
598100	600460	They kind of are getting back at each other
600460	605900	You know one does something to the other group and you know in return
605900	608540	they retaliate with something even more harsh and
609060	611060	It's getting nuts
611580	617340	But the game it's got a lot of really good radio stations on the actual, you know vehicles and stuff
617340	620780	They have a lot of good licensed music. In fact, their 80s station is fucking awesome
621020	625060	Did you say something on your Twitter about crashing while you were listening to something?
625060	625500	Oh, no
625500	631500	We were we were flying in a biplane buzzing over a freeway shooting at cars while listening to man
631500	637340	or was it land from down under I mean, that's just it's just so crazy and
638140	642300	There's a lot so that catches you off guard. There's a mission that there is a direct
643900	645900	reference to Jack Thompson in
647060	655040	Just a lot of really fun stuff and I mean this game is literally maybe forget about Grand Theft Auto 4. It's that good now
655900	660820	First I must say though the graphics in the game. They are a step up from the the first game
660820	668500	The glitches there are still some glitches in this game and some pretty bad ones at times
668500	672860	Like there'll be nothing that really stops the game from working. Just kind of like, huh?
673780	675940	Here's here's Loki playing a Saints Row 2
675940	677940	Now
691660	698220	Anyways, I've seen the first act deaf says in chat a man six feet down under yeah get it get it
700020	702980	So, yeah going back to the glitch why we have a chat room there was
702980	708900	One time where I had blown up a bunch of stuff during a mayhem mission and when I came back
709460	716020	You know after the mission was done the park benches hadn't respond, but people are still sitting down like there was benches there
716540	719580	There's another one where I was watching a cutscene with
720140	726060	Some vehicles or whatever in a caravan and each one of the vehicles in the caravan ran into a telephone pole
726060	731700	That was on the corner because they were it's like the AI is sort of off a little bit like in their past
731700	733700	It's just like off
733860	737740	Slightly like there'll be another move you can do with a samurai sword
737740	741020	We can literally like stab someone up through their throat, but it's too high
741100	745260	So you're stabbing above them and it just you know reacts the nose
745580	751140	No, like above their head it just acts like you're reacting to hitting them, but it's not quite right
751140	754700	And this is a release version. Yes, but here's the thing
755500	760940	It doesn't matter though. It's still early awesome and they have like chainsaw kills just like Gears of War
760940	767100	Which you know it sounds like it's not gonna be graphically the greatest game ever or the sound or whatever
767100	772740	But it's just for you. It's just it's fun. It's big dumb stupid blow shit up fun. It is
772740	776980	It's like blow shit up the game. That's pretty much what it is. That's what you've always something like that
776980	781940	But yeah, it's that's pretty much what if you're looking for game is supposed to be like cutting-edge and stuff
782580	784260	This is probably not it for you
784260	789460	But you know as far as you know the activities in this game are definitely a lot better than Grand Theft Auto
789460	794260	And it's a lot of fun, and the story is actually pretty crazy, so
795300	797700	in fact actually the one of the girlfriends in the
798740	805980	Brotherhood kind of looks like that redheaded chick from Final Fantasy 13 that they have in the promo shots lightning so I
806620	810900	Don't know, but we'll us. Hopefully see a little more of this later very nice
811660	815120	Rama says I'm not touching Saints Row 2 until I finish one lol
815180	818340	Yeah, it probably a good thing to finish one because there are I mean
818340	820780	I don't want to spoil anything, but yeah
820780	826460	There's a lot of stuff that ties back actually it's kind of cool about this game is the map itself. It's
827580	832620	Not exactly the same as the first game in fact. It's very different, but there's a lot of parts in here like wow
832620	835580	Hey, I remember that you know like streets and stuff
835580	839900	They're kind of the same, but a lot of it's changed, so it kind of gives you that hey
839900	845540	I've sort of been here before but a lot has changed because you know there's about five years in between the first and second game
845540	847260	a
847260	851440	Retertainment in chat says thank God for patches. How is the developer with patches?
852900	855540	Pretty good, I guess I mean last game
855540	857180	They only do one patch on it
857180	862420	So I didn't really fix a lot of glitches in there are still some glitches from the first game that you can do in
862420	866900	This one like for example if you hop on top of a car and you hit the Y button to get in
867700	872100	You'll just instantly teleport into this inside the car. Just like you could in the first game
872100	877560	I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that they've added in they have a new system for
878260	885500	driving that kind of is like burnout a little bit where if you get points for you know oncoming you know
885900	887900	traffic near misses
888620	890620	Drifting that kind of stuff and you get little
891220	893420	respect bonuses with that and
894700	898180	They have a whole the customization of the characters is just insane
898180	902660	They've added so many different sliders when I literally spent 40 minutes in this game
903740	905580	Setting up my character look like me
905580	911140	So, you know, it's so elaborate with like actually taking pictures of my face and trying to get the proportions, correct?
911140	915060	I don't know. We'll see if it looks correct when we we actually show it off. But uh
916300	923340	They have you can make some really fucked up looking characters in this game though. Seriously, and it's funny because they always comment to you
923340	925340	They're like, did you do something with your hair?
925340	930180	That's nice on me because you could be a totally different gender nice, but they have three different
930940	933900	voices for male and female you can pick from you can pick your
935420	942220	Your stance you they have a taunt and they also have kind of like a a compliment little
943140	946740	gesture you can do they have everything for doing the little jig that uh
948900	950900	What's-her-name did and
950900	956060	To like Michael Jackson's stuff. I have my guy kind of doing that. Hey
957900	963220	And then my my taunt is just you know, flipping someone the bird no, it's funny nice
963420	968900	But yeah, lots lots of customization a really fun game. Seriously. You gotta check it out
969700	971220	All right
971220	973300	I've been playing some new games this week as well
973300	977780	I've been playing the old standbys as well World of Warcraft as I mentioned dark soccer earlier
977780	982340	I just squeezing some more in before the new wrath of Lich King comes out, which by the way
982340	983900	I'm thinking I'm gonna buy at 7-eleven
983900	986220	I was at 7-eleven randomly because I was craving a Slurpee
986580	991180	Like two o'clock in the morning and I actually they have a big old ad there for reserving games
991340	996660	Like wrath of the Lich King and and all these other, you know, like what else was coming out that they were pushing
996980	998060	I
998060	1003460	Like, you know other sports games are coming out and all this stuff and I'm thinking who's gonna buy their freaking games at 7-eleven
1003460	1008300	There's gonna be nobody there the night it launches. So I think that might be where I go to get it. We'll see but also
1008300	1012880	There's a big big content patch coming to Warcraft on Tuesday and it's gonna change it. It's like the pre
1013400	1018740	Release patch so it's gonna be most of the major changes are hitting not this Tuesday next Tuesday
1018740	1023320	So I'm trying to squeeze in the last bit of a burning crusade while I can before the patch
1023860	1027500	Also been playing rock band 2 tons and tons of rock band 2
1027660	1031220	I'm having that moment where like today I was at Sonic randomly and you know
1031220	1034140	I was sitting there talking to a friend of mine and then I heard over the speaker
1034380	1039040	That's what you get done and I'm like, oh, this is a rock band 2 song. I know this song now
1039340	1043660	It's pretty bad when I'm going out in public and like oh, hey rock band. I'm like thinking in my mind
1043660	1045660	Okay, strum strum strum strum
1045780	1046940	anyhow
1046940	1050420	New games. I've been playing this week Mega Man 9 finally came out on the Xbox 360
1050420	1052380	So I decided to pick it up because I wasn't gonna get it on the week
1052380	1054940	So I don't have the space and then on PlayStation 3
1054940	1058780	I don't even have yet because a little big planets not out and so I probably won't crack until like next week and get a
1058780	1065100	PlayStation 3 now, but I did finally get Mega Man 9 and Xbox 360. It's fun. It's hard. It's retro
1065100	1069860	It's probably everything you've heard about although I will say this the controls were not as bad as I was expecting
1069860	1073740	I thought the controls are gonna be horrific on the Xbox 360. It actually isn't that bad
1073740	1079940	I'm actually able to use the analog controller and still kind of get that old-school Mega Man feeling
1080340	1082820	Which is very necessary especially for you know
1082820	1088460	Because you know all the old cliches are in it where you have to have perfect timing to jump from block to block or moving
1088460	1092780	Platform a moving platform where you're gonna fall in spikes and you know be done for
1093540	1098980	You know what the game is though. It's not that it's necessarily hard. It's just about learning patterns. It's patterns patterns patterns
1098980	1102900	That's all the old Mega Man games were too. Except I think the difficulty was toned down in them
1102900	1104900	I think what Mega Man 2 was released here in the US
1104900	1108860	We got like the Japanese easy version or something like that where it was much easier, you know
1108860	1112320	That's the one most people remember this game, you know, they don't apologize for the difficulty
1112320	1115320	But it's just about memorizing patterns, you know a splash woman stage
1115320	1118380	I probably played that like 25 times and died many many times
1118380	1123580	But now I can get through it without dying because it's just about memorizing where you jump win. That's that's what it is
1123580	1125600	It's all pattern memorization. That's it
1126700	1129680	Rama says Mega Man 9 is on the Mega Man 2 engine hard as fuck
1129680	1133500	They should have packed a vibrator with the game and told you to stick it in your ass and turn it on high
1133780	1138560	Wow, I don't know about that. I think that's more of a res application actually
1140060	1141500	So, yeah, I've played it quite a bit
1141500	1145740	I've probably sank in at least two hours in the game and I've not even beat like four bosses
1145740	1147740	I think I've beat three so
1147900	1149900	But I'm having fun
1150100	1158260	Also, I've been playing Silent Hill homecoming. I checked out I bought earlier this week and I made a mistake playing Silent Hill homecoming
1158260	1159460	This week because I'll tell you what
1159460	1163940	Remember I said earlier in the show when I opened the show it rained for the first time in Sacramento this week
1163940	1167620	Right for it since February ever. Yeah, I think it was the first time ever
1167620	1170580	No rain here for like the first time since February. It's been a long time
1170580	1176780	So we've gotten rain here. So my roommates gone all weekend. He went to Disneyland this weekend the bastard. So he's gone
1176780	1182980	I'm completely by myself in the house. It's midnight. The winds blowing outside. It's raining and
1183460	1185820	Suddenly I find myself in Silent Hill
1187500	1188500	And
1188500	1192700	It's just scary, you know, we got the ambient music playing, you know
1192700	1196180	You're kind of this actually track from Silent Hill 3 not the new game. That's right, you know
1196180	1202320	And I'm just walking around and everything's all dark and scary and I'll tell you what this game
1203140	1205660	Totally relies on cheap thrills, you know
1205660	1211300	like I'll be walking around and exploring trying to find the other half of the x-ray so I can solve that first little puzzle and
1211300	1216960	Then BAM the wheelchair falls down from the staircase and scares the fucking shit out of me
1217820	1221420	Because all you have is like a little lot of flashlight, right and then um
1221420	1227700	God, there's also like a part where you're just like walking through a hall and a fucking body just falls out the ceiling
1227820	1234420	This game definitely relies on a lot of boo tactics, but it definitely has that ambience as well to it
1234420	1240380	Um, the graphics aren't quite as good as I would have expected for a next generation Silent Hill game
1240380	1246580	But it's by no means bad. It's probably on par with the last generation of games, but just a widescreen and a little bit crisper
1246580	1251820	Um tiger class when I saw a pyramid head was I scared and screaming with joy. Here's the thing
1251820	1256840	I didn't get far enough because that night seriously after the wheelchair found out that fell down the staircase and
1257060	1258760	My no, I'm not even kidding with you
1258760	1263460	My front door blew open right after that happened because of the wind and I was like fuck this
1263460	1267580	I can't play this game right now. So I turned it off. I tried playing a little more
1267580	1272220	I played for about another 90 minutes the next day and I noticed there was a distinct lack of save points
1272220	1275300	But I got through the first little area and got to another one
1275300	1277300	But I haven't gotten to pyramid head yet
1277540	1280380	Which I you know that tells you I'm not that far in the game at all
1280380	1284180	So I I can't give a full review to this game because I haven't really seen enough of it
1284180	1289020	But I definitely can already tell it's it's worthy of being a Silent Hill game. And if you like cheap scares
1289660	1291660	You'll enjoy it
1292380	1297740	Henderson man in chat says Silent Hill looks better than that siren crap and I couldn't get into siren. Hmm. I
1298460	1304780	will say though in the very very beginning of the game is one of those places where it starts to turn from
1304780	1311460	Day to night, you know good Silent Hill dark Silent Hill or whatever you want to call it and that's creepy is very creepy
1311460	1315740	But it's pretty much the same. It's a cinematic. It's not really something that happens live as is going on
1315740	1322700	So Henderson man does confirm the save points are few and far between so when you see a save point in Silent Hill
1323220	1325220	Cherish it. Although from what I understand
1326100	1329420	The game does kind of autosave as you go so that if you do die
1329420	1331900	You don't have to go all the way back to your last save point
1331900	1337300	But if you turn it off you do so there you go. I'm having fun with Silent Hill homecoming
1337300	1338780	I will play more of it this week
1338780	1345140	Maybe not when I'm home by myself though, because it's a little bit scary a little bit scary. All right, that's our gaming weeks
1345140	1350340	Let's talk a little bit about housekeeping of which we don't have a whole lot to say except in three weeks is episode number
1350680	1356940	300 of our show we'll have more details on that when we get a little bit closer to it because we really haven't planned anything yet
1358260	1359580	also
1359580	1365680	Don't forget to check us out on our live journal at username orange lounge or our Facebook the ol army just search for ol army
1365680	1370260	Under groups or our myspace at username orange lounge radio or the Twitter at olr. Yes
1370260	1374100	That's four different social networking sites and four different names that we have on each of them
1374100	1377780	We have a real problem with consistency here at our launch radio
1378300	1382240	All right. Let's get into some gaming news tonight. There's just a
1382940	1387280	Part a tonight is almost all Nintendo news. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's a little press conference
1387280	1392660	They had just dominated the news this week tons and tons of Nintendo news. So that's what we're gonna start tonight, right?
1392660	1400260	Loki yes, and of course the big news coming out of Nintendo's press conference was that they're announcing the brand new revision for the DS
1401060	1403060	Boy, we didn't see that coming
1403220	1408960	And apparently the new DS is called a DS. I what makes it different is it's slightly smaller
1408960	1416080	It is missing the Game Boy Advance slot, but replacing it with a brand new SD memory card slot
1416080	1421240	Also, the system has two cameras on it a point three megapixel camera
1421240	1428240	Which will be facing the user kind of in between the two touch or the one touch screen and the other screen there
1428960	1433100	Also, there is a 1.3 megapixel camera on the outside
1433640	1437400	the screens are slightly larger now there are three and a quarter inches and
1437400	1445920	And you can also sync your photos with the Wii photo channel and also will include a free web browser application built inside as well
1446960	1453780	Also, just like the rumor said you can play back your music on there. It will be using AAC
1455440	1459680	compliant music files, so no mp3s unfortunately and
1460680	1466460	Is scheduled to ship November 1st in Japan in both black and white and will cost
1466460	1467780	approximately
1467780	1469780	178 dollars US or
1470860	1472860	189,000 yen and
1474460	1476460	Yeah, it's kind of cool US
1477340	1479340	Not getting it for a while
1479340	1480380	unfortunately
1480380	1483820	So why because they hate us yes because they hate us
1483820	1487180	I see and because they say that the DS is selling so well over here
1487460	1492520	Not anymore now that you announced a brand new version that will be coming out next year stupid
1493180	1494380	God
1494380	1495580	but uh
1495580	1499260	Yeah, and also the other big thing about it is there will be a new DS
1499260	1504180	I shop where you'll be able to download games kind of like we wear, but you know for the DS and
1505660	1510500	Some of the games there range from free to about 800 points, so
1511220	1512940	kind of cool
1512940	1519300	You're obviously the homebrew fan on this show and Tiger Claw and chat says the DS homebrew community are gonna pretty much find ways
1519300	1523360	To hack the DS I says they can use the SD cards to do all sorts of things. Yes fault
1523360	1525700	yes, definitely and you know the
1527060	1532620	The memory card thing will definitely help also the fact that there's cameras built into it
1533820	1536860	I'm assuming there's gonna be a little bit more RAM built into it as well
1537500	1538860	it just
1538860	1542900	It's not gonna be that hard especially since it has to play all the other
1543500	1547560	DS or the yeah the DS cartridges so at the very least it will
1547560	1553100	Still work the way the DS does as far as homebrew step goes so does this mean you're gonna kind of want one
1553700	1556940	Yeah, the thing though that you have to understand though with this one
1557340	1562220	And I thought that they had onboard storage as well like a little bit of onboard storage
1562220	1568140	I could be wrong though is that this one will probably be able to receive any some sort of firmware updates
1568620	1570620	Whereas the other ones weren't I don't know
1571340	1574500	But what if this didn't have the SD card slot on it?
1574500	1578060	Would you still be as interested or would it be not interested because there's no way to hack it no
1578060	1581160	I'd still be interested really. Yeah, you can still hack it. I mean you just
1582040	1584440	Do it the way you're doing it now is it the camera?
1584440	1585300	What it what is it you are?
1585300	1588380	You just want a new system to hack or do you want you like the other features?
1588380	1588740	No
1588740	1593860	I like the the cameras and I'm interested to see because they're gonna have games that they're releasing for it that are only
1594020	1597080	Dsi games, so it's not gonna be able to be played on the DS
1597700	1602860	So I'm kind of wondering what other features they're gonna have on there, or how they're gonna utilize different things
1602860	1609400	I guess we have a lot of time, so we'll get to see, you know, what comes out in Japan first, I guess.
1611100	1612660	Comments from Chaurum.
1612660	1614660	Segg says, about the web browser,
1614660	1619620	it's roundabout free. Each DSI will get 500 Nintendo points, known as Wii points formerly,
1619620	1622920	which can be used to buy the 500 point opera browser on the DSI.
1622920	1625500	I heard about that whole 500 free points thing they were supposed to be doing.
1626860	1630620	Thoughts? I think that the web browser is just free anyways for like,
1630620	1633220	it's kind of like how it was when it came out over here,
1633220	1635780	where it's free for a while and now they charge for it.
1635780	1637900	I like this comment too. I want to read this.
1637900	1640580	The Rob D in our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com says,
1640580	1644760	you can't play your older games, you get a lousy camera, you get an SD slot,
1644760	1648180	you spend more money, and you get to spend more money in the shop. Yay.
1648180	1653800	Wait, I have to admit, I kind of agree. I'm not that excited about this little device.
1653800	1658420	In fact, I've been jokingly call it the DSI phone, because that's pretty much what it is,
1658420	1661220	but without the phone. It's kind of like an iTouch.
1661220	1666140	So it's a DSI phone, no, iPod light or touch or whatever?
1666140	1668260	An iTouch, yeah, DSI touch or whatever you want to call it.
1668260	1673840	In my mind, that's kind of what they're trying to do with this whole download store thing,
1673840	1678500	is that it's kind of trying to mirror that applications thing that the iTouch or the iPhone does,
1678500	1681060	which, you know, I don't think they're trying to copy or anything,
1681060	1684820	because this thing's probably been in development for a long, long time, but I don't know.
1684820	1690180	I can't... Here's the thing. I think I'm going to have to get one anyway,
1690180	1693780	because you know there's going to be that game that comes out at some point
1693780	1696980	where you have to use the camera that, you know, Nintendo just freaking does this.
1696980	1698820	There'll be some Mario game I'm going to want to get.
1698820	1708100	If this is as secure as the Wii was with their virtual console and their, you know, WiiWare games,
1708100	1712340	I don't think we'll have to worry about spending money on the application store.
1712340	1714980	Well, but hold on though. I mean, you know, come on.
1714980	1719620	I don't like to do that unless it's usually like import stuff or things you can't get here,
1719620	1723620	because, you know, I like to support stuff that's good, but, you know...
1723620	1724980	No, I'm wondering though if they're gonna...
1724980	1727780	They haven't announced yet anything about the virtual console stuff.
1727780	1730660	I wonder if some virtual console games will be compatible with this,
1730660	1731780	because that'd be kind of cool.
1731780	1732820	That might... You know what?
1732820	1735700	That alone would actually make me seriously consider getting one,
1735700	1738660	because that would really justify all those purchases I've been making.
1738660	1739380	That would be awesome.
1739380	1744180	Yeah, because can you imagine download to your SD memory card slot or whatever for like...
1744180	1748100	Maybe, you know, stop it at like Super Nintendo games or something like that.
1748100	1752100	I've gotten to the point where I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo,
1752100	1754660	because I'm like, well, yeah, that would be cool, but they're not gonna do it.
1754660	1756100	They're not... Or there'll be some...
1756100	1759460	There'll be an adapter that you're gonna have to pay 40 bucks for that'll do it.
1759460	1760420	You know, I'm...
1760420	1764820	I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo just based on history at this point.
1764820	1767380	So I don't get excited about these types of things anymore.
1767380	1768100	It's kind of sad.
1768100	1771940	Uh, Tigerclaw says, DSI also opens a new can of worms.
1771940	1775380	People will be sharing very inappropriate photos with each other via PictoChat.
1775380	1776020	Oh, great.
1776020	1780580	So if I go into the Penny Arcade Expo room at next year's PAX 09 and DSI or whatever,
1780580	1783060	am I gonna get cock shots all over my DS from people put...
1783060	1785460	Or from people putting it down their pants and taking a picture?
1786900	1787300	Maybe.
1788500	1789220	Hooray.
1789220	1789380	But...
1790340	1790980	But...
1790980	1791220	What?
1791780	1792100	But what?
1792100	1793300	I might get boob shots too.
1793300	1793780	I might.
1794420	1795300	I wouldn't mind that.
1795300	1801700	All right, uh, if you want to chat on this, uh, chat.orangeonstrategy.com.
1801700	1803700	Other things that were announced at Nintendo's press conference.
1803700	1808180	Speaking of SD cards, finally, and you know this has been a big thing for me lately,
1808180	1812260	I've bitched and bitched and bitched and belly ached and cried and been a big baby
1812260	1816900	about the fact that I do not believe I should have to remove my games from the Wii
1816900	1819140	to put them on a card and then bring them back.
1819140	1821300	You know, this whole, like, slow process.
1821300	1825620	I think they just should address the stupid onboard storage problem on the Wii
1825620	1827380	and they finally have.
1827380	1832820	You will finally be able to load channels directly from the SD cards in spring of 2009.
1832820	1834260	The biggest duh in the world.
1834260	1837460	The thing that we knew should have been there the whole freaking time.
1837460	1839140	Finally, they are installing in spring of 2009.
1839140	1841780	Why is it taking till spring 2009?
1841780	1843060	Why can't they do it now?
1843060	1843540	I mean...
1843540	1847380	I think they honestly didn't program it in to begin with and there's all the bug...
1847380	1852420	I think what they're trying to do, they're trying to close up homebrew loops with this too.
1852420	1853620	I bet you that's what they're trying to do.
1853620	1857780	When they release this patch, they're going to do their damnedest to stop the exploiting.
1857780	1861220	They're not going to stop it, but I guess they feel they have an obligation
1861220	1863220	to all the people that developed for their system to try.
1864660	1865940	Good luck with that.
1865940	1869860	Maybe you should talk to Sony and see how well that went with them and the PSP.
1870820	1871620	Were they up the home...
1871620	1874500	Don't you think they owe it to their developers to try?
1874500	1877380	Yeah, they owe it to their developers to try, but you know...
1878420	1882180	I don't think it's really hurting them right now as far as it's not allowed...
1882180	1888340	Well, I guess it could allow piracy, but so far the community has been good about keeping that out.
1889220	1894340	They do have a thing to load ISO's off of the memory cards or whatever,
1894340	1895860	but it doesn't work really well.
1896500	1898580	Here's why the update's taken forever.
1898580	1901700	They don't want you to copy stuff on your SD card,
1901700	1903940	take it to your friend's house and put it on their Wii.
1903940	1905780	So they're having to come up with the whole,
1905780	1907460	how are we going to get around this copy thing?
1907460	1910820	And the DRM basically, they're implementing DRM.
1910820	1912900	That's part of the testing that's pushing this thing back.
1912900	1914660	They already have DRM implemented.
1915780	1916740	Because if you save...
1916740	1917380	I guess it's true.
1920100	1922740	They're Nintendo, it takes them fucking forever to do something.
1922740	1923460	There, that's it.
1923460	1924420	We'll just leave it at that.
1925540	1928500	They're also the masters of making us buy new things.
1928500	1929620	But guess what?
1929620	1931380	To be fair, this is a free update.
1931380	1933300	It's not something that's going to cost us any money,
1933300	1935860	except for the fact that Nintendo-branded SD cards
1935860	1937700	are always $10 more than the other ones.
1937700	1939220	Well, then don't buy them.
1939220	1939940	I know, don't.
1939940	1942820	Well, here's the other thing that you're going to have a problem with too,
1942820	1944740	is they haven't announced that they're going to expand
1944740	1946100	the number of channels you can have,
1946100	1947300	so you're still fucked.
1947300	1948900	You're going to run out of channels eventually.
1948900	1951860	Well, but maybe that's just kind of a given.
1951860	1953540	I'm not going to hold that against them yet.
1954980	1956500	And that is a lot of space.
1956500	1959780	Or maybe the thing's smart enough to fill in with more channels.
1959780	1961620	I don't know, has anybody ever filled the damn thing up?
1961620	1962900	I imagine it's possible.
1962900	1964260	If you download nothing but Nintendo games.
1964260	1964740	And what happens?
1964740	1965620	You just can't put any more?
1965620	1966260	You can't put any more.
1966260	1967060	Wow, that sucks.
1968500	1969140	Huh.
1969140	1969540	Patch!
1970100	1970980	All right.
1970980	1973780	Oh, it might be a part of this patch that you'll add new channels.
1973780	1975540	I'm not getting negative about that yet.
1975540	1976260	But we'll see.
1976260	1977460	More to come in 2009.
1978100	1981140	Well, as far as other things that are going to be coming out for the Wii,
1981860	1984420	the Wii Speak channel was unveiled.
1984420	1988020	It actually, Wii Speak is the microphone peripheral
1988020	1990740	that's coming with Animal Crossing and is getting its own channel.
1990740	1994980	Um, and that's about all that we know right now.
1995620	1997620	That it's just Wii Speak.
1999380	2000740	So it's going to get its own channel, though,
2000740	2003060	so it's not something you're going to have to use Animal Crossing for.
2003060	2003940	You can just...
2003940	2004820	I would assume.
2005620	2009620	But, you know, there's no true details yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.
2010180	2014420	I mean, I'm actually thinking that something like that would work for them to do,
2014980	2016500	like, karaoke games.
2017140	2017780	Hmm.
2017780	2018660	Wouldn't that be cool?
2018660	2019460	That'd be interesting.
2019460	2022020	Um, or just call your friends.
2022020	2023540	I mean, seriously.
2023540	2024340	Well, but, but...
2024340	2025060	Do you really...
2025060	2026100	Well, hold on, hold on.
2026100	2026420	Nintendo...
2026420	2029060	Long distance costs money, minutes cost money,
2029060	2031780	that's why VoIP is getting popular.
2031780	2032340	So I...
2032340	2036900	Yeah, but most people have, like, you know, pretty decent phone plans.
2036900	2040660	I mean, hell, people are spending, like, 100 bucks a month on stupid unlimited plans.
2040660	2045220	Hell, my plan, which is dirt cheap, has unlimited nights and weekends,
2045220	2047940	and, you know, long distance is included in there.
2047940	2049780	I mean, seriously, just...
2051060	2053300	Okay, what if I want to talk to someone at four in the afternoon?
2053940	2055300	I have a cell phone.
2055300	2055800	Hmm.
2056820	2058340	I don't have a landline.
2058340	2060100	I know, I don't have a landline either.
2060100	2062580	But myself, I only have so many daytime minutes on my cell.
2062580	2064180	Maybe I want to talk to people, or maybe...
2064180	2066820	The one other thing is that, you know, maybe I want to talk to rooms,
2066820	2068420	like, you know, so we can talk to a party.
2068420	2068980	I text.
2068980	2070500	I text more than I talk on the phone,
2071060	2073860	and Dan uses his phone pretty much only people call him or business,
2073860	2075700	and you get those rollover minutes and there you go.
2075700	2078100	Um, Sagan Chat says,
2078100	2080980	WeSpeak will also use friend codes for chatting with friends,
2081540	2082580	and follows up with, I don't know,
2082580	2085140	WeSpeak would make a great room phone.
2085140	2086340	Groups talking to groups.
2086340	2087140	That's what I'm saying.
2087140	2088420	Network parties together.
2088420	2090260	That's going to be its biggest benefit.
2090260	2092740	But yeah, I think the friend codes for WeSpeak is a given.
2092740	2095060	I cannot imagine a Nintendo place
2095060	2098500	where you could go into a room and chat with strangers.
2099060	2102180	Can you imagine the potential for horrible stories that come with that?
2102180	2103380	You know what would be cool?
2103380	2103860	What?
2103860	2109220	Is doing the next Mario Party game with the voice over IP.
2109220	2110020	Okay.
2110020	2112740	So you can, like, talk shit to everybody you're playing with.
2112740	2113460	Okay, nice.
2113460	2115460	Call them dirty whores when they get a higher, you know.
2115460	2116580	That's an awesome idea,
2116580	2119060	which is why it'll never be implemented ever.
2119700	2120900	I know, sad.
2121460	2123220	You have to understand, they come up with these ideas,
2123220	2124900	they're all, sorry, that's too cool for our console.
2124900	2127380	You could kind of do that on Xbox Live now,
2127380	2129620	except you're going to have to settle for Fusion Frenzy 2.
2129620	2135220	I've put my phone on speaker.
2135220	2136980	In which case, I think I'd rather chew glass.
2138340	2142020	There's always Vivo Piñata Party, which is slightly better.
2142020	2145300	So instead of chewing glass, Rob would want to chew plastic.
2145300	2148980	Mario Party is definitely the top tier, you know what I mean?
2150740	2151060	All right.
2152100	2152740	Let's move on.
2152740	2154260	You should make your own party game.
2155300	2157620	What would an Orange Launch Radio Party game be?
2157620	2159940	Well, it'd have your weirdo map all over the place.
2159940	2161380	Get naked and tell your friends.
2161380	2164340	No, like Mario Party, except you've got, like, weapons.
2165700	2170180	And, like, you can get a tank, or a Humvee with a rocket launcher on it.
2170180	2171380	Mortal Kombat Party.
2171380	2172500	And, and, and, and, and.
2172500	2173220	What?
2173220	2175140	Sometimes the dice will have dirty commands on it,
2175940	2177940	and there'll be lots of guys making out.
2180500	2182580	Wait, lick, kiss, suck.
2183140	2185700	You've got the dirty dice part of the game.
2185700	2187540	Dirty? I don't know.
2187540	2189460	You have to roll them for guys making out.
2190500	2190820	Okay.
2191380	2192420	Anyways.
2192420	2194260	Sadly, I think no one would buy this game.
2194900	2195940	Yes, exactly.
2197380	2199620	So, a game that someone might buy.
2200500	2201060	Pikmin.
2201060	2208100	They're actually doing a brand new series of games called Play on the Wii, or Wii Day Asobu.
2208100	2212820	And I guess, of course, Pikmin is going to be one of the first games.
2212820	2216500	Basically what they're doing, it's kind of like what they alluded to before,
2216500	2219780	like they're, like, kind of a matter of fact stuff when they're talking during E3.
2219780	2220580	They're just like,
2220580	2225620	yeah, you know, who's to say that we couldn't take, I don't know, GameCube games and just,
2225620	2231140	I don't know, throw the Wii controls onto them and release them for cheaper?
2232100	2234260	And didn't everybody say back then,
2234260	2238660	oh, just you wait, here comes the tidal wave, everything will be re-released.
2238660	2243540	And, sure enough, here they go, they're re-releasing Pikmin,
2244340	2250420	basically the GameCube version with, you know, fucking Wii controls thrown in there, woohoo.
2251300	2257220	And, yeah, so that'll be the first game that's going to be part of that.
2257940	2264500	But, never fear though, it's not actually the Pikmin game they were talking about before,
2264500	2266900	which, you know, Miyamoto alluded to.
2266900	2271780	He is actually making a new Pikmin game, so, you know, this is not, like, you know,
2271780	2273780	hey, we're going to release a new Zelda game.
2273780	2275540	Oh, just kidding, it's the old Zelda game.
2275540	2278900	I'm actually kind of okay with this whole re-releasing of games things,
2278900	2283300	because you know everybody has that one game that they want out of this.
2283300	2288180	For me, it's F-Zero, and, you know, maybe there's people that won't win Waker, I don't know.
2288180	2292260	Isn't there something on GameCube, or what about, like, Metroid Prime 1 and 2?
2292260	2295540	There's got to be something you want out of this, right, Loki?
2295540	2296040	Uh, no.
2297540	2299460	Maybe win Waker, but that's it.
2299460	2303060	Anyways, the Pikmin game is coming out December 25th in Japan.
2303060	2309060	It's going to be available for 3,800 yen, and that's approximately $36 US.
2309060	2313060	And, also, some other games that are going to be coming later on.
2313060	2318900	Nintendo is going to be re-releasing Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, apparently on...
2318900	2322420	Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
2322420	2323540	But with the lack of beat.
2324180	2327540	Yes, I guess before Pikmin, even though this was supposedly the first game,
2327540	2332580	but Donkey Kong Jungle Beat will be coming out on December 11th in Japan.
2332580	2341460	Also coming soon will be Chibi-Robo Pikmin 2, Mario Tennis, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2, and...
2341460	2342820	Of course, of course.
2342820	2345540	That's it, no word on release dates for the rest of those.
2345540	2348820	But, um, yeah.
2348820	2350260	That's kind of cool, I guess.
2350260	2354740	You know, because the Wii certainly doesn't have enough GameCube ports.
2356580	2357140	All right.
2357780	2358820	I'm currently depressed.
2360020	2361700	While Loki was reading that story, what happened?
2361700	2366260	I pulled my DS out of my purse because I was looking for something, and the corner broke off.
2366260	2366980	How did that happen?
2366980	2367380	I don't know.
2367380	2369380	It must have gotten broken in my purse.
2369380	2370180	That sucks.
2370180	2371620	I guess I have to get a DSi now.
2373380	2374580	That's what she does.
2374580	2375780	No, but she's totally serious.
2375780	2376580	She was just showing it.
2376580	2377940	The corners, like, snapped off.
2377940	2379540	Yeah, I'll put it on the camera.
2379540	2381620	Is that how you get the husband to buy you new toys?
2381620	2382900	Aw, Dan, I broke it.
2382900	2383780	Get toys anyway.
2383780	2384340	It doesn't matter.
2384340	2385300	Dan, I broke it.
2385300	2386020	I'm sorry.
2386020	2386980	I need a new one.
2386980	2388180	Here, you know, I have a-
2388180	2390980	No, I can fix this with, um, duct tape and silicone glue.
2390980	2392580	There ain't nothing duct tape can't fix.
2392580	2393620	Seriously, just look at it.
2393620	2395300	I can fix it with silicone glue.
2395300	2399220	If you guys want these games, I mean, why don't you just buy the original GameCube games?
2399220	2401140	Remember, they do play on the Wii.
2401140	2403300	But, but, but enhanced Wii controls.
2403300	2404100	Really?
2404100	2405220	Widescreen.
2405220	2410420	Have you known, have you known any games that the game, or that the controls actually enhance
2410420	2412340	the, you know, the playability?
2412340	2417060	How many times, how many people were, you know, prefer to play on the GameCube controller
2417060	2419460	for, like, Mario Kart and Smash Brothers?
2419460	2421220	Is it really enhancing stuff?
2421220	2422260	I'm sorry, no.
2422260	2427700	It's just gonna get people to, I don't know, buy more of their products, and it's an excuse
2427700	2430420	they're saying, look, we're still releasing first-party products.
2430420	2432420	Oh, but they are remakes.
2432420	2434020	What if the games are only 20 bucks?
2434020	2438180	That's about how much a lot of the GameCube games still cost, like the old Smash Brothers.
2438740	2440260	If they're 20 bucks, then awesome.
2442500	2443000	Alright.
2443540	2445620	Would you consider buying them if they were only 20 bucks?
2445620	2446120	No.
2447060	2451300	Darkstalker is currently showing off that the DS does still work over on our Justin TV feed,
2451300	2454180	which you can see at Justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2454820	2458500	Meanwhile, back to more news about the DSi, and earlier, Loki had mentioned that there's
2458500	2462020	gonna be a store that's opening up, and that's why I kind of joked that it's the DSi phone,
2462020	2465860	but it is opening up, and they've already announced what the first few games are gonna
2465860	2468340	be available on the DSi shop, but guess what?
2468340	2471620	They are games that you can already get in a traditional card format.
2471620	2476900	Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2, but, but, but retooled.
2478020	2480820	So that means they're gonna have some extra new feature that's gonna want to make you
2480820	2485460	buy these games again, and that's what Reggie Fils-Aime announced at the US press event
2485460	2489140	that is Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2, even though the games have already sold over 10
2489140	2494340	million units, it just made the most sense to be the kickoffs for the new DSi shop.
2494340	2498900	See, I'm wondering though when the microtransactions are gonna start, because you know before too
2498900	2504020	long in this DSi shop, it'll be download new games for Brain Age, not like necessarily
2504020	2508980	a full blown Brain Age 3, but like download new brain training sequences as if they were
2508980	2510420	rock band songs.
2510420	2512020	You know it's coming, right?
2512020	2513220	That's why they're doing this.
2513940	2518660	They want a piece of the microtransaction pie, and the, the Wii wasn't really set up
2518660	2522100	to handle it very well, even though I guess maybe Rock Band 2 is gonna have it after all,
2522100	2523060	but still.
2526500	2526980	Why not?
2526980	2528180	The DS is out there.
2528180	2529540	Tons and tons of people have one.
2529540	2531220	It's a hugely popular system.
2531220	2532820	I have a broken one!
2532820	2534820	Let's bring microtransactions to it.
2534820	2536820	Let's get you to buy another DS system.
2536820	2539620	Maybe Nintendo will sell you some duct tape for 500 Nintendo points.
2539620	2543860	Because really the DS is just kind of like an upgraded Game Boy Advance, and how many
2543860	2545780	times did they try to get you to buy the Game Boy?
2547060	2547560	Yeah.
2547560	2548360	But, but, but.
2548360	2548860	Too many.
2549480	2550200	But, but, but.
2551000	2552680	I have to get another one now.
2552680	2558360	And besides, with them releasing a new system, like the DSi, they can release Mario, Super
2558360	2561960	Mario Brothers DSi, and Mario Kart DSi, and Metroid DSi.
2561960	2563400	How about CSI DSi?
2565400	2565900	Rob?
2567000	2567400	The what?
2567400	2568200	CSI DSi.
2568200	2569160	CSI DSi?
2569160	2569800	I like that idea.
2569800	2571960	Yeah, that would be like a major awesome marketing point.
2571960	2572760	That would be awesome.
2573720	2574600	Alright, let's move on.
2574600	2575320	I'm going to weep.
2575960	2576280	Why?
2576280	2578040	I'm weeping inside of my soul.
2578040	2579320	Why, because you're your DS?
2579320	2580040	I am.
2580040	2581560	Can we have a moment of silence, please?
2581560	2582200	Silence, please.
2583080	2583720	Excuse me.
2583720	2584360	Alright, there we go.
2585720	2592280	The ferret would like to make a statement on behalf of my poor, broken, like me, DS.
2592280	2593160	And what could that be?
2596120	2597240	Game news!
2597240	2598280	Senate Punishment 2!
2599800	2600680	It's coming on Wii.
2602840	2603340	That's it.
2603340	2609260	Um, interesting, because Sin and Punishment 1 was never really released in the US.
2609260	2610460	So that's kind of interesting.
2611340	2612140	I mean, it was.
2612140	2613260	We got it on Virtual Console.
2613260	2614700	Yeah, years later on Virtual Console.
2615260	2618540	That thing must have sold real well for them to want to bring that out over here.
2618540	2620860	Because that's an interesting game to dig out of the archives.
2621820	2623100	It's pretty badass looking, though.
2623900	2625580	Yeah, is that something you might be interested in picking up?
2625580	2626060	Yes.
2626060	2627260	It's looking pretty cool to me.
2627260	2632220	I wanted the first one to come out, although we didn't pick up the Nintendo 64 one online,
2632220	2633900	but, you know.
2633900	2636540	You can always maybe get an import one of the real thing.
2636540	2638140	But they're probably hard to come by at this point.
2638140	2638700	I doubt it.
2638700	2639260	I've seen them.
2639820	2640620	I've seen carts.
2640620	2644220	You can get imported Nintendo 64 carts for not bad.
2645420	2645920	Alright.
2646860	2651660	Well, hey, if they release a demo or something, or I can play a little bit of it, maybe I'll
2651660	2651980	buy it.
2651980	2652700	It looks interesting.
2653420	2655740	Yep, and we need more reasons to buy games.
2655740	2659820	And Nintendo has now provided us with yet another reason to buy games.
2659820	2665740	And that would be Club Nintendo is finally coming to North America by the end of this
2665740	2666240	year.
2666700	2670460	And you'll be able to get points with their loyalty program.
2671180	2676540	And by earning points, by purchasing their games, and I guess accessories, I'm not really
2676540	2677100	sure about that.
2678300	2684700	You will be able to trade those points in for Nito rewards, like different accessories
2684700	2686540	that are exclusive to the program.
2686540	2690300	You might remember in Japan they did some of those Game & Watch DS games.
2690300	2693900	There was a Tingle Balloon Flight game, or Balloon Fight.
2696220	2699820	There was that weird Power Rangers looking thing.
2699820	2700620	I don't know.
2700620	2702540	But yeah, lots of exclusive stuff.
2702540	2704300	So that's pretty cool.
2704300	2707740	Hopefully we don't get lame shit on our side, you know?
2707740	2710300	Because they may have Club Nintendo and it's like, stickers!
2711740	2713340	Temporary tattoos.
2713340	2714380	Plastic rings.
2714380	2715820	Wallpapers, yay.
2715820	2717180	Mario underwear, yay.
2718700	2724700	Well, I've registered a lot of old Nintendo games on Nintendo's official site just in
2724700	2726220	case something like this ever happened.
2726220	2727900	Am I going to get credit for that?
2727900	2728780	No, you're not.
2729580	2731500	I'm not registering anything else until this comes out.
2732140	2733420	Because I bought Wii Fit this week.
2733420	2735580	It doesn't matter because there's going to be something different.
2735580	2739740	There's a different Club Nintendo thing that you're going to have to register, not the
2739740	2741020	actual games themselves.
2741660	2743100	But isn't that where the whole...
2743100	2745820	Well, isn't that what I get the points from?
2745820	2747580	Yes, but that's going to be something separate.
2748460	2750540	Well, then why should I continue to register?
2750540	2752620	Why should you continue to buy anything from them?
2752620	2753500	That's what I say.
2753500	2755660	Well, if they put out a good game, I'm going to buy it.
2755660	2758220	And I wanted Wii Fit anyway, because I'm fat.
2758860	2759360	So...
2760220	2760780	Rob.
2760780	2761280	What?
2762620	2763120	Come here.
2763820	2764320	Stand up.
2765020	2765420	Stand up.
2765420	2766300	Put your microphone down.
2766860	2767420	Stand up.
2768940	2770940	Come this way, because I'm not getting up.
2770940	2773340	Hold out your hand.
2773340	2773840	Ow!
2775420	2776940	Now, S-T-F-U.
2778540	2779740	Whatever, I need to tone.
2780300	2781180	But you're not fat.
2784940	2786460	All right, now that I've been...
2787340	2788140	Chest-ized!
2788140	2789420	...abused during this program, can we please...
2789420	2791180	It's not abuse, it's chest-isement.
2791180	2793180	Can we please move on with gaming news?
2793180	2793820	Oh, it's me.
2793820	2794380	Hey.
2794380	2795180	Yeah, Rob.
2795180	2796860	All right, well, the game The Conduit.
2796860	2800780	Lots of people have been looking forward to this, because it's all sci-fi, futuristic
2800780	2803100	y, first-person, shootery, but hey, it's on the Wii.
2805260	2805980	Apparently...
2807420	2808300	Here's the weird thing.
2808300	2813580	The Conduit was announced at the press event that it's going to be an exclusive first-party
2813580	2814060	shooter.
2814060	2815500	That's because she's a dumbass.
2815500	2816940	A lot of people got really excited about it.
2816940	2818460	Who do we mean by she, Loki?
2819260	2820140	The dumbass.
2820140	2826380	The one that talks about, you know, snowboarding, her son is so awesome because he makes cards
2826380	2826700	for her...
2826700	2827580	Cami Dunaway.
2827580	2827980	Cami Dunaway.
2827980	2829260	Yes, the dumbass.
2829260	2829900	All right.
2829900	2831660	So, um, here's the thing.
2831660	2836060	So, apparently, you know, it was called the first-party title, but then, a little later,
2836620	2842060	apparently, it actually was retracted that, uh, Nintendo is not actually publishing The
2842060	2842540	Conduit.
2843260	2846060	I knew right away that she was an idiot when she said that.
2846060	2848060	I'm like, it said, you know, first-party shooter.
2848060	2850060	I'm like, she meant first-person shooter.
2850060	2851020	She's just dumb.
2852460	2852860	Whatever.
2854300	2857820	But really, I wouldn't be surprised if they picked this up, and I think that they should
2857820	2860940	anyways because, come on, man.
2861660	2862140	Seriously.
2862700	2865820	Um, I guess the only concern would be that they're competing with themselves.
2865820	2867340	Does it really matter?
2867340	2871020	I mean, is it just, like, the ad dollars and the marketing push that'll come out of it
2871020	2872060	depending on who picks it up?
2872060	2873580	You know, who's got the money to sell it?
2873580	2873980	I guess.
2873980	2878460	The game is, it's not going to change a damn thing about the game itself, right?
2878460	2883260	No, it's not, but it's just that if there's a publisher, then it means it's coming out
2883260	2883740	sooner.
2883740	2884940	It's just, you know, that.
2884940	2887980	And I don't understand why anyone wouldn't publish this game anyways.
2887980	2891740	There's been so much hype around it, and Nintendo's been pushing it so much anyways, and they
2891740	2893020	don't have a publisher yet.
2893900	2897100	I mean, it's kind of retarded to be pushing a game that's not going to be coming out anytime
2897100	2898220	soon, but whatever.
2900540	2902460	Well, I don't know.
2902460	2905420	Loki, this looks like something, and you've talked about this game before.
2905420	2908540	Is this a, do you care who publishes it, or you can get the game, or what?
2908540	2909500	No, I don't care.
2910140	2910620	All right.
2911740	2912700	Well, then let's move on.
2912700	2914700	Well, then let's move on.
2914700	2919740	Well, Ian, remember that we talked about the game that even a penguin could play?
2920860	2922140	And, Rob, you like penguins!
2922140	2923340	I love penguins!
2923340	2925660	Rob, that's why you should be running Linux.
2925660	2926380	Hi!
2926380	2928220	Well, you know, I like penguins just not that much.
2928220	2928460	Penguins.
2929180	2929580	Anyway.
2929580	2931660	That's why you should be wearing tuxedos, Rob.
2931660	2933900	I know, and that's why I should live in Antarctica.
2933900	2935420	And you should eat tuna.
2935420	2937020	You know, there's warm water penguins.
2939020	2940220	All right, well anyway, what about the damn penguin game?
2940220	2947820	Anyway, the penguin game is actually made by Yuji Naka that's called Let's Tap, which
2947820	2952780	is, and it has nothing to do with penguins, I think.
2952780	2953980	Like tap dancing?
2953980	2961180	I don't know, but I guess it's supposed to be another kind of, I guess, I don't know
2961180	2966700	if it's a music kind of game, but you use the Wiimote face down.
2966700	2971500	You basically, the game is played by facing the Wiimote, right?
2971500	2976300	You put it face down on something, a surface, and you hit that surface with your fists,
2976300	2979820	and it makes the Wiimote bounce, and then you use that in different little mini games.
2982700	2983180	Interesting.
2984220	2985500	I still think Let's Tap sounds-
2985500	2986620	Can I continue with my story, too?
2986620	2989980	Well, Let's Tap sounds like a tap dancing game to me.
2991340	2992380	I don't know if you remember this.
2992380	3003180	Well, also, first of all, had I not been interrupted, I would have actually said something about
3003180	3003660	games.
3003660	3005820	Oh, that's what we do on this show.
3006620	3007820	All right, what else?
3007820	3015900	Well, the other game is one called 428, which is a game that uses real photos of people
3015900	3022860	in the city with text on it, but it was actually shown in the whole show role thing that they
3022860	3023980	did at the conference.
3023980	3026220	So this will be out in December.
3026220	3032060	I think we should release a sequel to Let's Tap called Let's Tap That Ass, or Let's Tap
3032060	3032620	That Keg.
3033500	3033980	There you go.
3035900	3039100	It should be like WarioWare, but everything is tap, you know?
3039100	3041260	Anyway, it pops, so it's all tap.
3041260	3042220	Tap Keg!
3042220	3045980	Also, release date for Let's Tap will be on the 4th of December.
3047100	3047660	Nice.
3047660	3049180	National Penguin Day.
3049180	3049820	Is it?
3049820	3050700	No, I made that up.
3055180	3056300	All right, we'll see.
3056300	3057340	Uh, yes.
3057340	3058300	Let's Read a Book.
3058300	3059900	That should be a game that comes out on DS.
3059900	3060620	Let's Read a Book.
3060620	3061580	Let's Read a Book.
3061580	3063260	Let's Get Edumacation.
3063260	3065420	Let's Watch Television Instead.
3065420	3068220	I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with Let's Read a Book.
3068220	3070380	I mean, seriously, some of the stuff that they come out with?
3070380	3071100	Weird.
3071100	3071900	Let's Poop.
3071900	3072400	Yeah.
3073260	3079100	So, um, anyways, there's some other announcements that they made during the second day of their
3079100	3086380	press event, and these were, of course, um, new WiiWare games, and of course the first
3086380	3090060	one, which I think they've already talked about before, Tetris Party.
3090620	3092620	It's a brand new Tetris game.
3092620	3098380	In fact, there's modes in it that kind of look like Luminous a bit, and, um, they're
3098380	3106460	actually going to even have a mode where it's called, um, Squat Mode, where you play using
3106460	3111180	your ass on, um, the Wii Balance Board, and you drop your pieces that way.
3111180	3113020	Squat?
3113020	3116060	I don't like hearing you squat and drop your pieces.
3118380	3120380	Yeah, I pay good money for my Wii.
3123820	3124320	Wow.
3125020	3125520	Yeah.
3125520	3127440	Yeah, they went there.
3128320	3133680	Um, and then of course, um, there's another game, which they're comparing to Little Big
3133680	3134320	Planet.
3134320	3135280	I'm sorry, no.
3135840	3137360	That's not even close.
3137360	3142320	But it's called Boings, because there's a Z at the end, because that's hip and cool.
3142880	3147680	Um, it's from the company Ninja Bees who have put out a bunch of other games which all seem
3147680	3153040	to look similar to each other, and, um, I guess they were saying that this game's kind
3153040	3159840	of, uh, Little Big Planet meets LocoRoco, and, um, it's a 2D, 3D puzzler platformer,
3159840	3167760	and it's gonna be, I guess it follows these elastic creatures who are called the Boings,
3167760	3173360	and, um, they can be grabbed and stretched and flicked across 30 levels of the game.
3174320	3177680	And I guess the game should be coming out pretty soon, because it's just been submitted
3177680	3183600	to Nintendo for approval, and, uh, should be out either October 20th or 27th.
3185360	3187440	Is no Little Big Planet, though, that's for sure.
3189120	3190880	But seriously, all their games look similar.
3192880	3195520	Um, I guess the Tetris one kind of looks interesting.
3196640	3197200	We'll see.
3197200	3198080	It's neat.
3198080	3201120	Um, by the way, we were talking about TapIt obviously a little bit ago.
3201120	3203600	Our chat room broke out in a game of BopIt.
3204720	3205920	Oh, wait, you remember BopIt?
3205920	3207120	BopIt!
3207120	3207680	Twist it!
3207680	3208080	Pull it!
3208080	3209200	You remember that whole thing?
3209200	3210000	The little device?
3210000	3210400	You had one of those.
3211280	3212880	I don't think I have one.
3212880	3213600	You had one.
3213600	3215280	I had one a long time ago.
3215280	3219600	Because I remember us trying to do it very drunkenly at one of those fantastic parties
3219600	3220640	that used to occur at your place.
3220640	3222880	Yeah, that was before OLR was on the air.
3222880	3224400	That was years ago.
3224400	3226080	But yeah, that was, uh, good times.
3227600	3231680	And anyway, I was trying to look on that for a clip of that commercial on YouTube to play
3231680	3234400	in the background, but all I could find were commercials for Kidz Bop.
3234400	3236400	I didn't want to play those on the air.
3236400	3237760	It would be kind of frightening.
3237760	3239840	Can you imagine if there was a Kidz Bop Sing Star?
3241040	3244400	All right, we've got to wrap up the Nintendo Press Conference, but there are so many more
3244400	3245840	games we didn't even begin to talk about.
3245840	3247120	Like Punch Out!
3247120	3248640	Hello, Punch Out!
3248640	3250560	Also, a new WarioWare game's coming out.
3250560	3251840	Mario & Luigi 3.
3252480	3255840	We have some of the other games that were coming out announced.
3255840	3260320	For the Wii, there's a Klonoa remake, apparently.
3260320	3261200	Or it might be a new...
3262480	3263200	No, it's a remake.
3263200	3264640	Door to Phantomville, it's new.
3264640	3265600	Klonoa, Klonoa!
3265600	3267840	There is a karaoke game coming from Hudson.
3267840	3268400	Punch Out!
3268400	3271840	We didn't even talk about that, but it looked like in the previews there was King Hippo
3271840	3272640	was back in it.
3272640	3273520	I know, I heard you.
3275280	3279040	A game called Cosmic Walker, which is a spacewalking game.
3279040	3281520	A memory game called Start with 100 Words.
3281520	3282640	But Klonoa.
3282640	3283360	I know there is...
3283360	3285120	Remember these 100 words or you die!
3286960	3291520	Forever Blue 2 Beautiful Ocean, the sequel to Endless Ocean, was also announced.
3291520	3297280	And, and, and, some video from Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time that connects
3297280	3298880	the DS to the Nintendo Wii.
3298880	3300400	Wasn't this supposed to be a launch title?
3301520	3302240	Klonoa.
3303360	3303840	Shut up!
3304480	3304800	Maybe?
3305520	3307680	Trace Memory, also known as another code.
3309280	3310800	Wand of Magic, an action RPG.
3310800	3311840	That's all on the Wii.
3311840	3317760	And then, of course, plenty of crap on the DS as well, including Mario & Luigi RPG 3
3317760	3319440	and another WarioWare game.
3319440	3325040	And, uh, a 3D version of Picross is supposed to come out as well.
3325040	3327200	Wow, that sounds boring.
3327200	3329040	And a fortune-telling game.
3329040	3331280	You remember the old Taboo game on the NES?
3331280	3332320	I remember Klonoa.
3334080	3335360	I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.
3336320	3338800	But, oh, Jamie, Jamie, this game's right up your alley.
3338800	3339920	This is, uh, this is great.
3340800	3342800	Uh, Wagga, wait, what is this?
3342800	3344640	Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode.
3344640	3346080	It's a fashion game from Nintendo.
3346080	3346720	But Klonoa.
3347600	3349040	No, Klonoa's not in it.
3349040	3350000	I have Klonoa.
3350960	3352800	That game has a sad bummer ending.
3354400	3354960	Spoiler!
3354960	3359120	This show's gonna have a bummer ending if you don't shut up about Klonoa.
3359120	3360960	Voldemort kills Klonoa.
3360960	3361440	Really?
3361440	3364080	Klonoa sounds like a sexually transmitted disease.
3364080	3365440	It kind of does, actually.
3365440	3365940	Oh.
3366560	3369520	Hey, uh, that's about it we have for the Nintendo Press Conference.
3369520	3374960	But in our pre-OLR Twit that we asked on the Twitter, uh, it's Twitter.com slash OLR,
3374960	3376640	we asked this question to you guys.
3376640	3381360	Did Nintendo's press conference this week make up for their lackluster E3 showing?
3381360	3382080	Why or why not?
3382080	3384400	Loki, what do you think before we get to the Twitter answers?
3384400	3388240	Um, I thought that they made up for it a little bit, but there's still no mention of Disaster
3388240	3393440	Day of Crisis, which I heard that they're waiting to see how it does in Europe before
3393440	3394560	they release it over here.
3395120	3395920	What?
3395920	3397280	I mean, that's kind of retarded.
3398480	3401040	Seriously, you're just waiting to see how it does in Europe?
3401040	3402480	That's gonna piss people off.
3402480	3407280	Um, but, I mean, I don't know.
3407280	3412160	I'm kind of, it was a little bit more exciting than what they showed at E3, but at the same
3412160	3413840	time, I look at what they're putting out.
3414560	3416080	A remake of Punch-Out.
3417120	3418320	A remake of Pikmin.
3419840	3422960	Uh, I don't know.
3423920	3427200	You know, a sequel to a game that we didn't get over here, which looks alright.
3427200	3428560	But it's just, you know, it's just okay.
3428560	3430560	It's something like, woo, awesome.
3430560	3432960	So in other words, you wanted more original IPs.
3432960	3436720	I want something a little bit, you know, they could have just shown Disaster Day of Crisis,
3436720	3437920	because that actually looked pretty cool.
3437920	3438960	What about Conduit?
3438960	3439920	They did show Conduit.
3439920	3440960	I mean, that's a new thing.
3440960	3444160	Yeah, they showed Conduit, which, who knows when the hell that's gonna be published.
3444160	3449040	In fact, um, there was something I heard about, like, WeMotion Plus being added to it, and
3449040	3451280	so that means it's not coming out until after March.
3452560	3455840	Probably, probably fall of next year by this, no, this time.
3455840	3457040	You know, what are they, Sony?
3457040	3457540	Seriously.
3457540	3462100	Alright, uh, DarkSakura, what do you think?
3462100	3463780	Did they redeem themselves from E3, or?
3464740	3466740	Um, I don't know.
3467620	3468340	I really don't know.
3469060	3472580	It's kind of one of those things where you have to have, sometimes these press conferences
3472580	3475460	look great, but then when you actually use the things that are teasing?
3476500	3480980	I really, it's a really wait and see thing for me.
3480980	3482740	It really is a wait and see thing for me.
3483300	3486500	Just because I've gotten excited about stuff.
3486500	3490900	And then found out it to be a big load of crap, and I don't like to be excited about
3490900	3491620	loads of crap.
3493860	3496820	I would rather think, oh, that looks like crap, and be pleasantly surprised.
3497780	3499300	The conference was okay for me.
3499300	3501060	There wasn't anything that made me squee.
3501060	3501940	I think that's the thing.
3501940	3508020	It was missing that certain Nintendo, that Nintendo fanboy squee giggle, I love you,
3508020	3510900	Nintendo, have my babies, that was kind of missing.
3510900	3515300	Well, then I'm glad you got something out of it, but for me, there wasn't really any
3515300	3515780	of that.
3515780	3521860	Seriously, punch out, punch out didn't look that, I mean, it just looked updated, like
3521860	3522660	graphics wise.
3522660	3524660	I mean, that's something that could have been released on WiiWare.
3525620	3527780	Yeah, it doesn't look that different.
3527780	3530340	It's just like, ooh, look, now it's like cel shaded.
3531140	3531860	Awesome.
3531860	3532820	Is it any different?
3534100	3536100	All right, well, let's see what your Twitter users thought.
3536660	3538820	GS68 says, sin and punishment too.
3538820	3542900	Too bad I was in computer lab when I read that, so I had to contain my phantasmic screens.
3542900	3548020	DJ Rama S says, nope, as much as I like the DSi and the new games, still wasn't much to
3548020	3548740	bring to the table.
3548740	3550820	Nice try, Nintee, see you next year.
3550820	3554340	Act Def says, at first I thought it was going to be the same lackluster conference for the
3554340	3557300	exception of the DSi, but then Nintendo went on and it was better.
3558180	3562660	Crows said, yeah, at least this one wasn't about cowbells, animal crossing, Wii sport
3562660	3564740	puppies, Wii music, or crazy drummers.
3564740	3565700	I don't want the new DS.
3566260	3570100	Dark Tetsuya says, well, I wasn't crazy about the idea of buying another DS revision.
3570100	3572820	However, the new punch-out sounds kick-ass even without Tyson.
3572820	3574580	Here's, okay, real quick.
3574580	3576420	Here's what's bugging me about Nintendo.
3576420	3578740	They're not trying to innovate at all.
3578740	3579300	They're not.
3579300	3582740	They're just putting out what they can get by is something new.
3582740	3584100	Well, hold up, though.
3584100	3586820	Oh, and wasn't the Wii console itself innovation?
3586820	3589700	That's fine, but they did that, what, a couple years ago?
3589700	3591140	Now it's time for something new.
3591140	3592820	Time to keep up with the innovations.
3592820	3595300	No, don't encourage them to put out new peripherals.
3595300	3596820	No, I'm not talking about new peripherals.
3596820	3600500	I'm talking about something new and innovative with the stuff that they already have.
3600500	3602180	I mean, look at Animal Crossing.
3602180	3603860	Oh, we added Wii Speak to it now.
3603860	3606820	I mean, seriously, that is just tacked on right there.
3606820	3608580	I mean, punch-out.
3608580	3611780	Oh, now it's just like Wii Boxing, but it's cel-shaded.
3612500	3613620	Big deal.
3613620	3614820	It's not anything new.
3614820	3615940	It's not a new IP.
3615940	3617380	It's not anything new.
3617380	3621220	It's just old made slightly new again.
3621220	3622020	They don't get it.
3622020	3625460	I think they're just watching what other people are doing, what's succeeding, and trying to
3625460	3627940	emulate that, but they don't understand why it's working.
3628740	3630340	More responses from the Twitter.
3630340	3634740	Did the Nintendo press conference this week make up for the lackluster showing at E3?
3634740	3637940	Chris says, almost everything at the conference was rumored for a while, so it was pretty
3637940	3638740	meh itself.
3639380	3641460	Picaruno says, just flat out hell no.
3642100	3644100	Jacksonman says, yes, to an extent it did.
3644100	3645380	Something new is better than nothing.
3646580	3651380	Joshua Rover says, Rowever, Joshua Rowever.
3652020	3653220	I had to spell it out.
3653220	3657460	So it says, the recent press conference Nintendo held has completely redeemed them to me.
3657460	3659700	They really do care about the hardcore that built them.
3660340	3662500	Deakman says, nope, still pretty lackluster.
3663220	3666660	Ionotropic says, hell no, they're still not catering to the core gamer.
3666660	3668580	That's almost two completely conflicting answers there.
3668580	3671220	That's really interesting between that and what Joshua said.
3671220	3675300	And then Gerardimo says, no, their excuse for being lackluster will never be forgiven.
3675300	3678980	They could have done all this at E3 and a separate event for Wii Music.
3678980	3679860	Interesting.
3679860	3681140	Very differing responses, too.
3681140	3683380	Those are almost like polar opposites, some of those.
3683380	3687860	So Nintendo definitely knows how to get people talking, if nothing else.
3688580	3691780	All right, well, let's take a look at what's coming out a little sooner than some of these
3691780	3695700	things we might have seen at the Wii conference, including, or DS, the Nintendo conference,
3695700	3697540	including this week's release dates.
3697540	3698580	Let's start overseas.
3698580	3700340	We've got a few today's worth.
3700340	3708420	On the 10th in the UK, we have Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway on PC, Korg DS10 on DS,
3708420	3714100	Midnight Club Los Angeles on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and Midnight Club Los Angeles
3714100	3715860	Remix on PSP.
3715860	3720020	On the 13th, we have Equestrian Training on DS, which I know that you're just so looking
3720020	3720980	forward to.
3720980	3721780	Yay.
3721780	3727380	On the 14th, we have NBA Live 09 coming out on damn near everything, but no one cares.
3729140	3729940	Well, there you have it.
3730580	3732420	Let's head on over to the US of A.
3733380	3733860	Okay.
3733860	3739060	In the US, there's actually a pretty good release week, starting off with some really
3739060	3739700	stupid stuff.
3739700	3744660	Pop QT Street Fashion Simulator from Koei is coming out on the DS.
3745540	3750820	And on the Wii, we've got another party game collection, Game Party 2.
3751460	3754900	Pretty much the same thing as Game Party 1, plus a little bit extra.
3754900	3759060	Line Rider 2 Unbound, hopefully actually coming out this time on the Wii.
3761460	3762340	Let's see here.
3762340	3764740	We've got a lot of NBA games coming out this week.
3764740	3770020	NBA 09 from Sony on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.
3770020	3775460	NBA 2K9 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.
3776020	3784260	And NBA Live 09 on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Live 09 all play on the Wii.
3785140	3788740	On DS, we have Spectrobes Beyond the Portals.
3788740	3790260	It's a sequel to that game.
3790260	3793780	Tenpin Alley 2, another bowling game for the Wii.
3795220	3797140	And let's see here.
3799780	3805620	Crash Mind Over Mutant on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Wii and DS this week.
3807300	3809540	Legend of Kage 2 on the DS.
3810980	3812340	Oh cool, I remember that game.
3812340	3812820	Yep.
3813460	3815540	Bleach Dark Souls on the DS.
3815540	3818820	Fracture on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3819700	3822180	Imagine Babysitters on the DS.
3822180	3824180	Eeeehhhhh!
3825060	3826580	What, you have a problem with that game?
3828420	3833860	Pray the Stars, it's actually kind of a neat little game, kind of like Katamari from Koe.
3835860	3837700	And let's see here.
3837700	3841700	Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune on the Wii and DS.
3841700	3844740	Soldiers of Misfortune on the Wii and DS.
3850740	3852100	Let's see here.
3852100	3855460	Guilty Gear 2, Overture on Xbox 360.
3857620	3863700	And some more Imagine games.
3863700	3865300	Imagine Fashion Designer, New York.
3866260	3870580	The Onimusha, The Essentials on 3-disc collector set.
3870580	3873140	It's the first three Onimusha games.
3874260	3876660	And My Spanish Coach on PSP.
3879060	3884420	And that is it.
3885620	3890180	Let's travel over to Japan and look at what's coming out over there on the Friday, October
3890180	3890820	the 9th, right?
3890820	3891540	9th is Friday.
3892340	3895060	Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock makes its way to Japan.
3895060	3897140	I do believe, though, this is not the bundle version.
3897140	3899140	I think it's getting a standalone release this week.
3899140	3903780	I think that's why it's on the release calendar again because Guitar Hero Aerosmith is also
3903780	3904820	hitting Japan this week.
3904820	3905780	I think that's the new one.
3905780	3908420	They're getting a bundle and the standalone game.
3908420	3911860	So that way I think, you know, I think Guitar Hero 3 was their first Guitar Hero game, if
3911860	3912660	I remember correctly.
3912660	3915220	So this is probably the first time they're seeing it standalone.
3915940	3917940	That is all coming out on the Xbox 360.
3917940	3920660	I imagine it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.
3920660	3921220	Yes, it is.
3921940	3924420	That's really it for those two systems this week.
3924420	3926260	You gotta wait till next week for some of the bigger stuff.
3926260	3931380	Uh, however, let's take a look and see what's coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
3931380	3934980	Uh, Harvest Moon, Tree of- I'm sorry, that's a US release.
3934980	3939140	Uh, Star Wars, The Force Unleashed comes out in Japan on the 9th.
3939140	3940100	So that's pretty awesome.
3941060	3943060	And let's check the PlayStation 2.
3944020	3945460	Uh, same Guitar Hero games.
3945460	3952660	Also, Infinity Plus gets a release as well as Daito Gaiken Koshiki Pachi Slot Simulator
3952660	3953620	24.
3953620	3957300	I don't think that's based off the TV series though, just so you know.
3958020	3962500	Also, the PlayStation 2 version of Star Wars, The Force Unleashed, and a game called Will-O-Wisp
3962500	3964740	Easter No Kiseki comes out as well.
3965380	3968580	Checking out the handheld systems to see what's coming out on there.
3968580	3971060	On the Nintendo DS, Snoopy DS.
3972020	3974100	Squeenix is putting out a Snoopy DS game.
3974100	3979060	Snoopy 2 Chuu Gen Taichi Ni Ei Ni Iku comes out.
3979060	3981540	And yes, that is Snoopy as in Peanut Snoopy.
3981540	3984900	Because those characters are very popular over there still.
3984900	3991620	Nihongo de Asobo, Kawaii Konyu DS 2 comes out as well.
3991620	3999300	And Tetsudo Musume DS Terminal Memory comes out in both a regular and limited edition
3999300	4000820	pack on the Nintendo DS.
4001780	4008740	And it looks like some game that centers around like, uh, uh, fly- uh, stewards and stewardesses
4008740	4009940	on airlines.
4009940	4012500	I don't know if it's some type of, like, drama turned game, but there you go.
4013140	4019140	Um, also coming out on the Sony PSP.
4022420	4028100	Um, Mahjong Portable Jansou Battle is getting a price reduction.
4028740	4029700	And that's really about it.
4029700	4031220	There is one other game coming out.
4031220	4032900	Looks like- looks to be a big one.
4032900	4034500	Uh, Macross Ace Frontier.
4035380	4036340	Sweet!
4036340	4037620	From Bandai Namco.
4037620	4038740	And, and one more-
4038740	4040660	Wait, wait, it's Ace Frontier?
4040660	4042740	I thought the series was Macross Frontier.
4042740	4043540	That's what they're calling it.
4043540	4044900	Macross Ace Frontier.
4044900	4049380	And one other game, uh, that looks- I think it's like an Othello- oh no, it's Go.
4049380	4052420	It's a, uh, version of Go on your, uh, PSP.
4052420	4056820	It's, uh, Umewaza Ikari no Yashi Igo.
4056820	4059380	And I think that must be, like, a championship player that's on the cover.
4060020	4061700	So, she's pretty.
4062740	4064660	They're using her pretty face to sell just Go.
4064660	4067780	So, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.
4069060	4070500	Let's move back into some gaming news.
4070500	4071380	Dark Sakura.
4071380	4072420	Do we gotta?
4072420	4073060	Yes, we gotta.
4073060	4076420	Actually, this makes me very happy, and I'm gonna download it depending on how it plays.
4077060	4082100	Um, but, um, they're bringing, um, pole position to the iPhone.
4082100	4083140	That makes me very happy.
4083140	4085140	It's all cutesy 3DE.
4085140	4087060	It looks like- they look like little toy cars.
4087780	4093860	Um, but it's, um, basically gonna be pole position.
4093860	4097540	I mean, I- I hopefully- hopefully it doesn't play like Pac-Man did,
4097540	4101460	because Pac-Man was a pain in the ass, or like, uh, Monkey Ball did.
4101460	4107220	You know, where you have to move the- if- if you- if you do do it- do- do-
4107220	4113220	if you do play with using- with moving the iPhone around, um, I would prefer that it
4113220	4119220	be a little bit more natural and intuitive and not have to be held at some funky-ass bizarre angle.
4119220	4120420	But, I'm gonna give it a try.
4120420	4127060	I mean, it's $9.99, but I think that, um, I think that it might be worthwhile
4127060	4128660	after a check arrives at my house.
4130020	4130520	All right.
4132500	4133540	And it's pole position.
4133540	4134180	It's old school.
4136420	4136660	Yeah.
4137780	4140580	Sadly, you don't really get the cool crashes in pole position.
4140580	4143380	It was just a little explosion graphic, but at least it was an explosion.
4145220	4149540	And who- I- I- I did- I remember the pole position cabinets from back in the day.
4149540	4150660	That was good times.
4150660	4152100	That's- that was 80s gaming.
4152100	4153140	I loved the sit-down ones.
4153140	4155780	You know that we actually built our first main cabinet out of a pole position?
4155780	4157220	Yeah, you still got it, right?
4157220	4158180	Somewhere, I think?
4158740	4162340	Well, now we've got our- our, uh, reefer Pac-Man thing that we were gonna put it in.
4163060	4163560	Cool.
4165860	4166420	All right.
4166420	4172020	Well, uh, D3 is putting out a new game, um, called Eat Lead.
4172580	4177860	And, um, it's kind of interesting the way that they promoted this thing.
4177860	4184900	Um, it stars a supposedly old school, uh, action game superhero called Mat Hazard,
4185460	4190100	who they created his own, um, kind of legacy, basically.
4190100	4195940	A bunch of knockoff games they have screenshots for, uh, from a website that they created
4195940	4197780	called Weapons of Mat Destruction.
4198420	4202420	And, um, they have one that looks just like, uh, Altered Beast.
4202420	4210180	They've got, um, you know, Mat Hazard 3D, Fistful of Hazard, Mat- Hazmat Carts.
4210820	4216500	And, uh, you only live, uh, 1370 times.
4216500	4222740	And, um, so along with all this stuff, the game itself is actually gonna be a 3D, um,
4222740	4223240	shooter.
4224020	4228980	And, um, some interesting stuff to go along with- along with that.
4228980	4234180	Let's see, got a bunch of, uh, information that you probably haven't heard yet, including,
4234180	4237860	um, the fact that there's gonna be some pretty cool voice actors in there.
4237860	4243060	You've got, uh, Neil Patrick Harris in there, as long- um, along with, uh, Will Arnett,
4243060	4245060	who are gonna be doing some of the voice talent for the game.
4245060	4250260	It's actually gonna be a third person shooter, and it's got a script written by, I guess,
4250260	4254900	this guy, uh, David Ellis, who did, um, I guess the Doctor Who serial, the Faceless
4254900	4255400	Ones.
4255400	4259480	And the game itself is gonna be- it kinda reminds me a little bit of Coded Arms, I
4259480	4264680	guess, because, um, the shooter game itself will take place across all sort of different,
4264680	4269400	um, video game cliches, but you can actually hack into the different characters and do
4269400	4271400	different things to them, so that's kinda neat.
4272040	4278280	And, um, also, they're gonna be, I guess, releasing later on some Flash games based
4278280	4283320	off the, um, 16-bit retro games that they were teasing that he actually made.
4283320	4285560	So, those will be coming out a little bit later.
4287000	4289640	So, what is this, like, a parody of games?
4289640	4293080	Yeah, basically, here's what it is, it's all, get ready for a fictional account of
4293080	4298040	the world's most popular video game hero of the 1980s, Matt Hazard is coming out of
4298040	4300280	retirement and making his next-gen comeback.
4300280	4302440	Okay, to me, this sounds like one of those things that could be actually, like, really
4302440	4305560	genius or really stupid, you know what I mean?
4305560	4306680	It sounds like a serious-
4306680	4309080	Some of those movies like Meet the Spartans, right?
4309080	4313400	Hey, it makes fun of all these great movies that came out in the past year, but it's
4313400	4315560	just, just the dumbest thing you'll ever see.
4315560	4319560	There's a lot of, like, games that have done it right, like, I think, like, Time
4319560	4324040	Splitters did the whole making fun of shooters games, uh, kind of, right?
4324040	4327960	They actually just went really bizarre with that game, but it was fun, and that was the
4327960	4331880	best part about it, and I hope they come out with a new one, because they released some
4331880	4336760	teaser, uh, concept art for it this week as well.
4336760	4341400	Uh, but anyways, um, and then it says, um, he's making his next-gen comeback in all of
4341400	4346440	his old enemies in a hilarious, um, or against all of his old enemies in a hilarious parody
4346440	4349640	of the last 25 years of gaming.
4349640	4352120	I don't know, it reminds me of something like a character that could have been, like, one
4352120	4357960	of the shareware characters, you know, from, like, you know, Apogee or, uh, Epic.
4357960	4359400	Uh, it could be cool.
4359400	4362680	Guess we'll see, comes out in, uh, I think February.
4362680	4364680	All right, we'll see.
4364680	4369480	Uh, one other thing that's coming out relatively soon, a Spore expansion.
4369480	4372760	That's right, because Spore wasn't enough.
4372760	4377400	Spore expansion, November 18th, the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack.
4377400	4382880	It's only 20 bucks, um, and, you know, there isn't much out there about what this is, but,
4382880	4386680	you know, if it's the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack, do you think it might be, oh, I don't
4386680	4389400	know, new parts for your creatures that you make?
4389400	4393640	Uh, well, it was leaked on, uh, apparently Amazon had the store pages up first, but now
4393640	4398480	that's also being spotted on GameStop, so, it is coming, and on November 18th, I, now,
4398480	4402080	my question is, digital download, surely this has to be something they're going to offer
4402080	4404920	as that as well, I mean, why not, right?
4404920	4409220	You're willing to give them money, so, uh, no word as to how many parts we're talking
4409220	4412320	about yet, but for $20, there better be quite a few.
4412320	4414560	Ooh, does the new expansion come with new DRM?
4414560	4415560	Because that'd be awesome.
4415560	4418920	I mean, yeah, I'd pay the 20 bucks if it'll uninstall, uninstall Secure ROM.
4418920	4422480	No, I'm just kidding, I shouldn't have to pay anything to get rid of that, but, you
4422480	4423800	know what I'm saying.
4423800	4429000	So, there you go, Spore expansion, for those of you Spore addicts, and, uh, I think I said
4429000	4431600	this during Bobby's show, I don't know if I said this earlier in this show, but, uh,
4431600	4435000	some of the monsters in Silent Hill Homecoming kind of look like they were made in Spore.
4435000	4440000	They're kind of creepy looking, like arms off people's backs and stuff, scary.
4440000	4441000	Very scary.
4441000	4442240	Are there any penis monsters?
4442240	4443680	There are no penis monsters.
4443680	4444680	Fail!
4444680	4450320	Why would you want to ruin Silent Hill with penis monsters, you know, put penis monsters
4450320	4451320	in a game that's already-
4451320	4452960	It's in your head, so that's good enough.
4452960	4453960	Exactly.
4453960	4455080	Is he just as prolific?
4455080	4458480	That's what I hear, but I haven't gotten to him yet, I haven't played enough, so we'll
4458480	4459480	see.
4459480	4462200	Yeah, VX JasonXV in chat says, no one bought Spore except for you.
4462200	4463200	Yeah, probably true.
4463200	4464200	Bobby did!
4464200	4465200	I'm probably the only one that actually bought it.
4465200	4466200	Oh yeah, that's right, Bobby did.
4466200	4468200	So, two people have Spore!
4468200	4469200	In the whole world.
4469200	4473600	No, apparently they've sold at least a million, I think, as I saw some figure earlier, so
4473600	4474600	go figure.
4474600	4481200	Alright, anyhow, um, let's take a moment to travel back in time and revisit the classics
4481200	4486360	in a little segment we call the Classic Video Game of the Week.
4486360	4490240	And DarkSakura is the one that likes to dig through her massive gaming collection to find
4490240	4491960	a game worthy of the title.
4491960	4494080	DarkSakura, what'd you pick for us tonight?
4494080	4500000	Well, first of all, I'd like to play the intro to this in just a second, which is why I like
4500000	4501000	the one I did.
4501000	4502000	Okay.
4502000	4503000	But wait a second before you try it.
4503000	4507240	But the game is called Nekkatsu Koko Dodgeball Boo, which is basically Super Dodgeball over
4507240	4508240	here.
4508240	4510240	It's one of the Kunio games.
4510240	4511240	So.
4511240	4512240	Nice.
4512240	4513240	Shall we have a little bit of intro?
4513240	4514240	Uh, we shall.
4514240	4517240	Let's see, do we want the whole Neo Geo splash screen and everything?
4517240	4518240	Why not?
4518240	4524240	That's what a Neo Geo sounds like when you press the on button.
4524240	4526240	Yep.
4526240	4530240	Super Dodgeball!
4530240	4543240	Can I tell us a little bit more about Super Dodgeball?
4543240	4548440	Anyway, um, Super Dodgeball basically is just that.
4548440	4549440	It's dodgeball.
4549440	4555000	You've got your characters, you've got your captain and your other characters, and then
4555000	4559440	you have the ones that are inside the court, and then you have the ones that stand around
4559440	4567480	the court, and as you eliminate characters, basically a little angel takes them to the
4567480	4569940	top of the screen and they go away.
4569940	4574920	But your life bar is basically how many teammates you have left.
4574920	4581340	So you defeat the other team by knocking out the teammates, I mean it is, you know, dodgeball.
4581340	4584700	So you have to keep knocking them down with the ball until they're just done.
4584700	4590160	And you've also got, um, a special throw called your power shot that your, um, team captain
4590160	4592360	can use.
4592360	4595920	I have to clarify some things in chat, because I love this game.
4595920	4598600	I was very excited when Dark Cyber picked it.
4598600	4599800	I really do love this game.
4599800	4604360	Uh, Rama asked in chat, isn't this the same version as on NES, same characters?
4604360	4609040	No it's not, because these are like custom characters, whereas the NES had the very general,
4609040	4611960	you know, like it was, they're definitely related games.
4611960	4612960	They play very similarly.
4612960	4616080	They're both in the Kunio series.
4616080	4621980	The one that I linked here, though, is actually the, uh, I believe the captain is like the
4621980	4633040	main character from, um, what we got is River City Ransom, uh, Nekketsu, um, Hot Blooded
4633040	4634880	High School Story or whatever.
4634880	4641080	Um, but anyway, uh, but with, uh, I think the special edition, because honestly it has
4641080	4642080	better music.
4642080	4647000	But in this one, though, you start off, you know, by going around the world, and you pick
4647000	4650440	your team from different places, but you start off with a game between Dallas and Chicago
4650440	4654440	to show who's gonna, you know, represent the United States.
4654440	4659680	And then you go around to England, Iceland, uh, China, Africa, although in later versions
4659680	4665120	it was changed to Kenya, you know, so you could run as fast as Kenyans, and Japan.
4665120	4674640	Um, but you, uh, when you beat Japan you actually get your, uh, World Cup gift to you by a ninja.
4674640	4681120	So, um, yeah, what I was basically saying is that the game, um, was part of the, uh,
4681120	4686480	the Kunio series, um, the first one being Nekketsu Koha Kunia-kun, which was what we
4686480	4689880	got as, uh, Renegade over here.
4689880	4694200	And we know that the other one in the series was, uh, River City Ransom.
4694200	4699200	The, the way that the game starts is basically Kunio gets hit in the head with a dodgeball,
4699200	4702200	and his teammates go and beat him up.
4702200	4709040	And the teams of Dallas and Chicago were actually, um, the teams of Nekketsu High School and,
4709040	4714600	um, Hanazono High School in the Japanese version, so, they, they of course modified it.
4714600	4720160	There was an NES version, um, that actually was, uh, published by Technos, which was the
4720160	4722280	one that released the arcade version.
4722280	4727000	But it's not even the same, it's not, I mean, from what I remember, okay, sorry, I just,
4727000	4729320	I'm very passionate about my dodgeball games.
4729320	4734320	Um, it actually had six members, you had the team captain and five others, and they were
4734320	4738280	all the same size instead of having your captain be, like, over huge.
4738280	4742880	And, um, you could only have three players inside the court, and you could arrange your
4742880	4747720	positions though, um, at the beginning of each match, so you could, you know, make use
4747720	4749880	of your different techniques.
4749880	4755040	Um, you could actually adjust, um, your energy, throwing power, throwing technique, and ball
4755040	4757440	break, which is, um, the, the curve.
4757440	4760040	You had agility, catching technique, and damage capacity.
4760040	4768960	Um, there are also two extra teams, there was, uh, India and USSR, um, so, it was, it
4768960	4773520	had a lot of the same stuff, but had some pretty significant changes, I guess, to make
4773520	4777400	it work on the NES, that's, that's, we had to deal with a lot of that, you remember the
4777400	4780040	original version of Strider in the middle of the NES?
4780040	4781040	Yeah, but...
4781040	4782040	It was based off of comic books, though.
4782040	4784920	Yeah, and Strider was just, like, like, it was also a totally different game.
4784920	4786960	It was, it was, the story was based off of comic books.
4786960	4790800	It's not even the same type of game, like, the Sega Strider was just, like, a straight
4790800	4795320	up, like, arcade action game, whereas, I, I don't know, there was that more open world
4795320	4796320	feel to the NES one.
4796320	4798920	They had, they had to do with the actual storage, they used to make it to fit all the levels
4798920	4799920	well.
4799920	4800920	I remember that.
4800920	4801920	But anyway, we've already done Strider.
4801920	4802920	Yeah, sorry.
4802920	4803920	Freakin' art-ass game.
4803920	4807640	Let me just say this, because VX JasonXV in chat brings up a related game.
4807640	4811160	Was anyone else epic disappointed by Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball?
4811160	4815760	Yes, I played the demo, and I thought it was awful, awful, awful, awful, and I, I quit
4815760	4818620	in about five minutes, and maybe I shouldn't judge something completely based off five
4818620	4822440	minutes of gameplay, but honestly, with demos, that's about how long you have to sell me,
4822440	4825760	and I, it made me miss this game, is what it did.
4825760	4829040	Well there's, um, other ones, and one of them is, I, I'm gonna mention the one that we're
4829040	4832560	playing the music for right now, because I love this version, but the other versions
4832560	4839400	that were released, um, was the X6800, um, that was put out, see, um, uh, Tecmos only
4839400	4844800	did the Famicom and, um, arcade versions, uh, I caught my breath for a second, but there
4844800	4849960	were other ones on X6800, it was released by SPS, which was a direct arcade port.
4849960	4858400	PC Engine had, um, Nekketsu Koko Dojiboru Bupishi Bangai-hen, which translates to Nekketsu
4858400	4864440	High School Dodgeball Club Bonus PC Edition, that was released by Natsoftsoft, um, in 1990,
4864440	4870280	which I've played this version a ton, it's actually pretty cool, um, and you actually
4870280	4875080	are having to fight off, um, aliens, disguised as dodgeball fighters.
4875080	4880360	There's a Windows version of the Famicom port that was done by BRS Corps, in 2003, PlayStation
4880360	4885960	2, um, had an, uh, arcade port, that was put out by Hamster Corps, as part of the Oretachi
4885960	4891680	Gessen Zoku line-up, uh, the Famicom version came out on, um, Gameboy as part of the Kunio
4891680	4897080	Kuneketsu Collection 1, there was, um, the version on Wii Virtual Console, which we got
4897080	4904920	over on September 22nd, so not too long ago, um, there also are official, um, sequels,
4904920	4911180	so there was Nekketsu Koko Dodgeball Bu-kyoteki, Dodgeball Soldier no Maki, which is Fearsome
4911180	4917120	Rival, Tale of the Dodge Soldier, for Gameboy, um, we also got Kunio Kuno Dodgeball Daiyo
4917120	4922760	Zenin Shugo, which is, um, it's Kunio's Dodgeball Gather Everyone, that came out on Super Famicom,
4922760	4927760	which I have played that one before too, and you have other teams, like, um, Italy, um,
4927760	4932840	it just is Arab, it doesn't say Arabia, uh, France, Brazil, and Germany, and then the
4932840	4938520	one that we're having a video of here, which is, um, the Kunio no Nekketsu Dojiboro Densetsu,
4938520	4944360	which is Kunio's Nekketsu Dodgeball Legends, um, the Neo-Geo release, um, that actually,
4944360	4950960	um, Tecmos did release this one, so that was pretty cool, but you also have, um, special
4950960	4955360	moves not just for your captain, but for, you have several main characters, and you
4955360	4959680	have to do Street Fighter II-like commands to get them to go off, like you saw the girls
4959680	4965040	do their little attacks in there, um, but you've got seven playable characters, and,
4965040	4970920	um, you also have your, uh, them being the main characters, so Nekketsu Kōha Kunio Kun,
4970920	4978280	you know, like in Renegade over here, um, also Super Dodgeball Advance, we, um, it wasn't
4978280	4985560	actually a Kunio game, so, but it was done with a lot of the same character style and
4985560	4990520	game play, it was put out by a million of you, but they also, the million did do an
4990520	4996360	official DS sequel called Chō Nekketsu Kōha Kunio Kun Dodgeball Boo, I just like saying
4996360	4997360	it.
4997360	4998360	Well.
4998360	5003360	And, there's also Super Dodgeball Brawlers that's supposed to be by Axis, it was supposed
5003360	5006360	to come out, did it already come out?
5006360	5007360	Yeah.
5007360	5008360	It came out, like, in May.
5008360	5009360	Yeah, it was supposed to be out.
5009360	5013000	I haven't played that one yet, I played the Game Boy Advance one, but not that one.
5013000	5016560	But it's supposed to, um, be used in the, the River City Ransom characters.
5016560	5017560	Awesome.
5017560	5018560	Let's check that out.
5018560	5025040	Which was, you know, the downtown hot-blooded fight, bar, story, whatever.
5025040	5029160	I wonder if you can go in there and order food at, um, a, uh, deli.
5029160	5033000	I wonder if it has that booty, like in the spa, remember, remember River City Ransom?
5033000	5034000	8-bit ass?
5034000	5041920	I just, I'm still gonna have to play the Japanese version of the PC engine of, uh, River City
5041920	5042920	Ransom for you.
5042920	5046920	Just because it's so cool, they go into a little, um, kisaten and order food, and they're
5046920	5049400	all like, I need a little out of me smiley faces.
5049400	5051680	I always liked that the smiles were free.
5051680	5053000	I always liked that the smiles were free.
5053000	5054000	Yeah.
5054000	5055000	That was great.
5055000	5056000	Alright, anything else on Super Dodgeball?
5056000	5057000	Um, no.
5057000	5059520	Alright, there you have it.
5059520	5065000	Your classic game of the week, and a real classic, and, yeah, don't bother with pirates
5065000	5066000	and ninjas.
5066000	5067400	This is because I picked something I had already done before and forgot about it.
5067400	5068400	Dodgeball.
5068400	5069400	That's alright, it's bound to happen.
5069400	5070400	How many weeks have we been doing this now?
5070400	5071400	At least 50.
5071400	5073480	We're, we started it on episode 250.
5073480	5075160	Are we running out of classic games?
5075160	5076160	No!
5076160	5077160	Never!
5077160	5079680	I'm like, cause I can think of a few we haven't done.
5079680	5080680	Like what?
5080680	5084480	Uh, you have never named one single, solitary Commodore 64 game.
5084480	5086920	Guess what, uh, System Jamie didn't play.
5086920	5092160	Well, what, if you're ever out during a week, I will bring a Commodore 64 game in the picture.
5092160	5093840	I already know which one I'm gonna do, too.
5093840	5094840	I already know.
5094840	5095840	Okay.
5095840	5098360	And it's one of those games people are gonna go, WTF is he picking that game?
5098360	5101200	Cause you better watch out, or I'll start busting out the Colecovision, yo.
5101200	5102200	Alright, wait.
5102200	5103840	Mouse Chaps, Venture.
5103840	5104840	Alright.
5104840	5105840	Plenty more to come.
5105840	5106840	We have to carry us through episode 400.
5106840	5107840	Carnival of Gorf.
5107840	5108840	Gorf.
5108840	5110240	I frickin' love Gorf.
5110240	5111760	I almost did Gorf.
5111760	5113880	Okay, Gorf is this soon.
5113880	5114880	Maybe next week.
5114880	5115880	Maybe next week.
5115880	5116880	Little teaser for next week, Gorf.
5116880	5117880	Alright, anyhow.
5117880	5122280	Uh, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but hey, stay tuned.
5122280	5126240	There's plenty more to come after a quick break, and uh, hey, during the break tonight,
5126240	5129120	since there's not a lot of free commercials for the free break anymore, cause no one's
5129120	5131920	sending me stuff, but that's okay, we got something even better.
5131920	5133440	Giving stuff away.
5133440	5137080	If you were paying attention to last week's show, we're drawing the names right after
5137080	5139640	this, if you weren't paying attention to last week's show, you got about five minutes to
5139640	5144920	find it, cause we're giving away some free Xbox 360 games, right after the, yes, I said
5144920	5148720	games, and I'll explain more, a little bit about that, uh, right after the break, but
5148720	5151880	for you podcast listeners, you have to wait like five seconds for that little transition
5151880	5152880	noise.
5152880	5153880	That's all you need.
5153880	5156360	Uh, but live listeners, you have to sit and listen to some music while we take a break,
5156360	5158920	rest our voices, potty, drinks, all that stuff.
5158920	5162720	So uh, well not like drink from the potty, that would be nasty, but you know, pot, yeah,
5162720	5163720	forget it.
5163720	5168120	Alright, we'll be right back with more Orange Lamps Radio right after this.
5168120	5176400	Alright, if you were listening last week, at this part of the show where we usually
5176400	5181280	do the free break, you know that we are doing a contest, and we are giving away copies of
5181280	5186000	Feeding Frenzy 2, that's right, the sequel to Feeding Frenzy, uh, available on the Xbox
5186000	5189040	360 is where we're giving away the game for, thank you to PopCap for sending along the
5189040	5191840	codes, so some of our listeners could try out the game.

5246000	5249960	get those codes sent off to our winners, but for now we're going to get back into Orange
5249960	5257280	Lounge Radio.
5257280	5260880	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, October
5260880	5267600	the 5th, 2008, where we are right in the middle of episode number 297, and of course we tape
5267600	5272760	live every week, Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby
5272760	5276720	Black Wolf show, and if you can't join us live though, you know you can always interact
5276720	5281600	with us through the Twitter, through the live journal, the email bag that we'll get to later,
5281600	5286080	there's just tons and tons of ways, we will, yeah, you have to do the mailbag, sorry, like
5286080	5290600	it or not, alright, but first we're going to do some more gaming news, right Loki, yes
5290600	5298120	that's correct, in fact, little known fact, there is a Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2 coming
5298120	5303320	out, and this is not to be confused with another expansion disc we'll be talking about in a
5303320	5310720	little bit, but Volume 2 of course contains some tracks that were available on the download
5310720	5317840	sites, both PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Marketplace, the track list contains
5317840	5324360	20 different songs, and it includes Avenged Sevenfold Afterlife, Blondie with Call Me,
5324360	5333720	Weezer, El Scorcho, Devo, Girl You Want, Maximo Park, Girls Who Play Guitars, Disturbed, Indestructible,
5333720	5339920	Angels and Airwaves, It Hurts, The Cars, Just What I Needed, The Police, Message in a Bottle,
5339920	5347600	Pixies, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Duran Duran with Rio, Motley Crue, Saints of LA, which
5347600	5353600	I want to say that was a free track, so that's not really fair, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Simple
5353600	5364320	Man, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow, Hayo, Nighish Nails, The Perfect Drug, Fall Out Boy, This
5364320	5371960	Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race, it's a goddamn arms race actually, but it's censored, yes,
5371960	5378400	Papa Roach, Time is Running Out, Garbage, Why Do You Love Me, Jesus Priest, You've Got
5378400	5384640	Another Thing Coming, and Smashing Pumpkins Zero, and this will be available for all four
5384640	5392400	systems and will also, and I guess this may be a trend coming soon to download packs,
5392400	5398440	it will allow you to basically download this to your hard drive with a code that's included
5398440	5405200	in the back of the manual, and this will also have I think achievements as well, because
5405200	5410060	you can play this game standalone as well. Well that sucks, because I have ten of those
5410060	5414480	songs already, is the game going to reimburse me for the ten I already bought? No. Lame.
5414480	5422360	Well you also have access to Xbox Live Marketplace, why would you spend this? Because I want achievements.
5422360	5426240	Why I cannot, well I mean you know, I don't really, but I'm being Devil's Advocate here,
5426240	5431240	I mean why is that fair that somebody who waited to buy it gets to get a thousand more
5431240	5437160	gamerscore? This is really meant I think for the people that don't have live, and this
5437160	5441320	is the only way that they can buy expansion packs. Fine. But it says yeah, included code
5441320	5446200	allows these songs to be downloaded and played with Rock Band or Rock Band 2 via the PlayStation
5446200	5450720	Network, of course this is the PlayStation 3 version I'm looking at the back of. So that's
5450720	5455800	interesting though that it can be downloaded for Rock Band 1 as well, so, hmm, interesting.
5455800	5465960	But yeah, this game does not require you to have the first game, or the second game. Interesting,
5465960	5469280	I don't know though, again I already kind of own pretty much the whole game, so there
5469280	5472480	you have it. But for those who don't, and you know to be honest, probably just buy them
5472480	5478400	online, probably a little cheaper anyways. Well actually no, if it's $2 a song, that'd
5478400	5484520	be about $40, and this is going to retail for $29.99, so you save a little bit of money.
5484520	5487720	I'm curious, is there anyone in our chat room right now that would be interested in buying
5487720	5493680	this? I bet not a one. Just because everybody in our chat room is obviously online enough
5493680	5497280	where they're online chatting with our show that they probably don't, you know their console's
5497280	5501360	online too I imagine. I guess it's good for those that don't have it, or for those that
5501360	5504720	are on the Wii where that's not really implemented yet even though it's supposed to be. Yeah,
5504720	5510160	it will be hopefully with this one, so maybe by the time the Wii version comes out, because
5510160	5514160	I think this is not scheduled to come out until November, it's around the same time
5514160	5519440	as the Wii version. Alright well that's not the only expansion for Rock Band coming soon,
5519440	5522840	but here's the interesting thing, the other expansion that's coming is not something that
5522840	5529400	you can already download, it's a brand new track pack, it's ACDC Live is coming. Sweet!
5529400	5533320	Here's the weird thing though, it's a Walmart and Sam's Club exclusive because I believe
5533320	5539480	there's a new ACDC album that is an exclusive, so go figure. And for those of you in foreign
5539480	5544200	countries that are pow pow pouting about that, hey, guess what, also for Europe, Australia,
5544200	5547860	and New Zealand in early December, so they didn't forget about you unless you're not
5547860	5552440	in one of those countries, and they did forget about you. All the songs from the disc, you
5552440	5557280	can use them in Rock Band and Rock Band 2 using an export authentication code, but here's
5557280	5563400	the thing, you can only use that once per disc. And I think that's the same with this
5563400	5568880	track pack 2 as well, I think it's only once per disc. Because, I mean come on, they're
5568880	5572480	smart enough to know, hey, they're just going to buy it and download it for five bucks to
5572480	5576800	all their friends, you know. You can only do that with Rock Band 1. And by the way,
5576800	5581000	that $29 price point is only for the Playstation 2 version, if you want the fancier ones for
5581000	5587880	a 360 PS3 or Wii, $39.88 is the magic price. That's fucked up. November 2nd, here's the
5587880	5591280	weird thing again, if you want it on Wii though, you gotta wait, November 16th is the date
5591280	5598120	for you. 360 PS3 and PS2, you get it on November 2nd. That's ACDC Live. And apparently the
5598120	5604800	game has its own set of achievements, which is very much in line with the same thing Loki
5604800	5608140	was talking about, although, funny enough, I'm seeing a lot of news this week on the
5608140	5612280	blogs about this, I'm not seeing a damn thing about what you just told us. Is that because
5612280	5616880	you told us a secret or what? No, I don't know why this isn't out there, I mean, it's
5616880	5621880	going to be available soon, it's just maybe it's not as exciting as ACDC. I guess not.
5621880	5625720	But there is a lot of confusion, I know, with at least us selling this, you know, it's like,
5625720	5629200	is this the same damn thing as the Walmart one, and this is something, but no, it's actually
5629200	5633560	something completely different. Interesting. And I was going to say, probably the reason
5633560	5639800	why it's not coming out on the, or coming out on the 16th for the Wii is because Rock
5639800	5643560	Band 2 is going to be the only one you'll be able to download that one for, I think,
5643560	5648680	or to do download play on. Alright. Well, there you have it, coming soon. If you like
5648680	5653980	ACDC, get ready to ring your hell's bells. Whoa, whoa, hold on a second, let me, actually
5653980	5657400	no, wait, no, that doesn't make any sense. I was going to say, well, that doesn't make
5657400	5660480	any sense, it's coming out on the 16th, and that means that you'll be able to save stuff
5660480	5664120	to your SD member cards, but I forgot, games already allow you to do that, it's channels
5664120	5668520	that'll be coming in 2009. Right, and it's 2009. Yeah, so there you have it. Alright,
5668520	5675000	we'll move on, more gaming news. Well, for anyone who played the first episode for Penny
5675000	5681020	Arcade and liked it, their second one is going to be cheaper. Hothead Games is actually listening
5681020	5691040	to consumer feedback, and is going to be releasing the game for 1200 Microsoft points, which
5691040	5705400	is 10 pounds 20 pence in pounds. It'll be 1495 US dollars on PC, which is 7 pounds 50
5705400	5714520	in the UK, so. 15 dollars is still expensive for that game anyways. That's ridiculous to
5714520	5721720	charge 20 bucks for, and I'm not sure if I want to buy the sequel. Well, I'm still interested.
5721720	5727880	I haven't finished the demo of the first one yet, to be honest. I don't know, I never finished
5727880	5736360	the first one. I got bored with it too quick, played other things. Oh well. Well, if Penny
5736360	5740880	Arcade Adventures Volume 2 is not the thing for you, then maybe something that they'll
5740880	5746180	show at Tokyo Game Show will be, and of course, Tokyo Game Show is right around the corner,
5746180	5751240	and we've got a listing of stuff that they're going to show off there, at least in Sony's
5751240	5756920	booth. There's going to be a bunch of titles, and a few unannounced titles, which we'll
5756920	5760000	just have to be surprised about. But some of the things that they're going to be showing
5760000	5768860	off, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes, looks like Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Final Fantasy
5768860	5775560	Dissida, or Dissida Final Fantasy. I like how they have Ratchet- Isn't that that awesome
5775560	5779280	looking fighting game? Yeah, that's the fighting game for the Final Fantasy fighting game.
5779280	5785560	I want to see more on that. Ratchet and Clank, Maruhai Mission Ignition, that's kind of a
5785560	5802040	cool name, Bleach Soul Carnival Potapon 2, Shin Sengoku Masui, I guess, Multirade. I
5802040	5811360	think that's the Gundam one. Let's see what else we have here. New Idolmaster game, Idolmaster
5811360	5817720	SP, Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam. Wow, there's three Gundams in that title.
5817720	5823920	That's kind of crazy. Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology 2, and of course in there
5823920	5828600	there's going to be three unannounced Sony titles as well. And then some third party
5828600	5833000	titles are going to be showing off. Guitar Hero, Legend of the Rock, FIFA 09, Street
5833000	5839640	Fighter IV, Resident Evil 5, Luminous Supernova, Metal Gear Online, Way of the Samurai 3, Sonic
5839640	5847320	World Adventure, SOCOM Confrontation, PlayStation Home, that's not a game, and Motorstorm 2,
5847320	5856560	Little Big Planet, Resistance 2, Smackdown vs. Ral 9, Dice Warriors Gundam 2, and R2
5856560	5861320	Ultimate Ninja Storm. GS68 in the chat room asks, Luminous Supernova? I believe that was
5861320	5866960	a game that came up earlier, it's the new PS3 network Luminous game, right? Yes, that's
5866960	5871160	the one. That's pretty much the same damn game you've played for years, but with new
5871160	5876560	skins and new modes, I think we talked about it on a previous show. There you go. Hey,
5876560	5880400	Sony's not the only one that's exhibiting some stuff at Tokyo Game Show. Konami's going
5880400	5884000	to be showing some things on the show floor, which, here's the interesting part, Metal
5884000	5889240	Gear Solid 4 is one of the games they're showing, so, I don't know. I guess, well, it's alright,
5889240	5892360	I mean, for a company to show games that are already out. I mean, hell, when we went to
5892360	5895920	E3 one year, they were still showing off Oblivion. Granted, they were still releasing download
5895920	5900960	content on a regular basis, at Bethesda, but whatever. Konami is also showing off World
5900960	5908280	Soccer, winning 11, 2009. Gensu Suikoden Tikris, which is that new DS one, and it's going to
5908280	5912800	be playable, that new Suikoden on the DS. Ah, it looks pretty hot. Castlevania Judgment
5912800	5917120	will be out on the floor, so will the new Castlevania Order of Ecclesia. Silent Hill
5917120	5920040	Homecoming will also be on the floor, even though it's out, and I believe it's out in
5920040	5924360	Japan as well. Chaotic Eden for the PC will also be on the show floor, and a game called
5924360	5931680	Tongari Bushi To Maho No 365 Nichi on the DS. Your guess is as good as mine as to what
5931680	5937480	that is. Ah, also showing a friendly company to Konami. Hudson will be showing some titles
5937480	5941660	on the floor. Ah, some Wii titles that they'll be showing on the Tokyo Game Show floor. Fishing
5941660	5948040	Master World Tour. Marble Saga Kororimpa, so now it's another, it looks like a new Kororimpa
5948040	5953080	game coming exclusively to the Wii. Ah, it's new levels, four person multiplayer gameplay
5953080	5956720	apparently is going to be in this new game. You can actually use your Mii this time around.
5956720	5960920	I'll tell you what, the first Kororimpa game, hours of entertainment by making the little
5960920	5964920	marba, the panda ball, and changing the sound effects to the farting noise every time it
5964920	5971500	would hit the wall. Ah, yes. That's what the game sounds like, it's hours of entertainment
5971500	5976100	because we all are seven. At heart. Um, but here's the thing, now they've built like a
5976100	5980200	story around it, because the first game was just kind of like, eh, just kind of go, but
5980200	5985440	now just license Marble Madness for god's sake. Seriously, make a new Marble Madness
5985440	5989480	game. I mean, come on, stop beating around the bush, just make a new Marble Madness game.
5989480	5992740	Hold on though, hold on though, you've got to listen to this story, okay? Ah, in this
5992740	5997060	game you are going to go on a quest with a character named Anthony the Ant, and Anthony
5997060	6002760	the Ant is searching for the golden sunflower. And you guide Anthony's marble around the
6002760	6007040	ant world and you get items that will help you reach the golden sunflower and you will
6007040	6013360	help save Anthony's colony. Ah, also, many more dangering mazes, amazing widgets and
6013360	6020440	gadgets to help your little ant friend out. Oh, oh, and one more thing, one more thing,
6020440	6025720	Wii Connect 24 capability, you can make your own stages in edit mode. Kind of neat, huh?
6025720	6029640	That's kind of neat. There you go. That's what the first game should have been. That's
6029640	6033560	alright though, we forgive him. Hey, one more game to announce from Hudson that's going
6033560	6040120	to be a Tokyo Game Show, not on the Wii, but on PlayStation Network, Bomberman Ultra. Bomberman
6040120	6045880	Ultra 8 player multiplayer online, 14 different arenas, 4 player local gaming, you can customize
6045880	6051800	your own Bomberman character, 50 different costumes, adding up to 150,000 possible combinations
6051800	6057440	of which 149,000 probably look like shit. But there you have it, that's how they are
6057440	6062400	selling the game. So it looks like pretty much what we got on the 360, a newer version
6062400	6065080	or whatever, a different version is coming to the PlayStation Network, but pretty much
6065080	6069760	the same type of game. I hope it's not what we got on 3, oh, yeah, the Xbox Live one,
6069760	6075800	I'm sorry. It wasn't bad, it was certainly better in Bomberman 0. It was extreme! Yes,
6075800	6080600	it was very extreme. There you have it, Konami and Hudson games to see at Tokyo Game Show.
6080600	6084960	Have fun to those that are going, you lucky bastard. Send us pictures. Well, I think we
6084960	6089160	have at least a couple listeners who are going. I do believe so, I've seen it around the Twitter,
6089160	6094280	so I expect many pictures. There's actually certain things that I would like to see, but
6094280	6099080	one that I'm actually very interested in that's only going to be a video only for PlayStation
6099080	6107760	3 is the game that was, the new game done by the creator of Katamari Damacy, which is
6107760	6113000	Keita Takahashi. It's called Nobi Nobi Boy, and really he just looks sort of green and
6113000	6120240	cylindrical with the prince face. It's like if they made it, you know, the Prince of the
6120240	6127800	Cosmos or whatever with a wiener dog. I know, right. But I would love for someone to get
6127800	6132640	out a video camera and tape me some footage of that, because we really, there hasn't been
6132640	6137760	anything really specific out on it yet, except some people playing with something that looked
6137760	6142860	like a dildo. And I will send you a dollar if you dress up your wiener dog like Nobi
6142860	6150520	Nobi Boy for Halloween. One whole dollar? One whole dollar! That's pure US currency
6150520	6154520	for you. There's also another game there that I want someone to tape me footage of so I
6154520	6163080	can see it, and that's, um, don't laugh, Anpanmantotuch de Waku Waku Training. What is that? Anpanman.
6163080	6168680	Huh. He's cute and made of bread. Alright. But just some stuff that's actually going
6168680	6177440	to be video only is Nobi Nobi Boy Galaga Legends for, I'm sorry, Legions for Xbox 360. On Wii
6177440	6184240	is One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Kotoba no Puzzle, Mojipitan Wii Deluxe, and Progolf
6184240	6192320	for Saru. Doesn't Saru mean monkey? Anyway. On DS, the video only ones are Dr. Slump,
6192320	6197760	Arale-chan, Dragon Ball Origins, and Anpanmantotuch de Waku Waku Training. Someone tape it for
6197760	6204480	me. Um, we also have, um, on PSP, Idolmaster SP, Wandering Star, and Missing Moon. PlayStation
6204480	6209760	2 is Super Robot Tyson Z, and PC, Legend of Galactic Heroes, which is pretty cool. There
6209760	6215700	are some playable, uh, things though, things of interest. Like what? Like whatever Happy
6215700	6221320	Dance Collection is, I guess? I don't know. Um, Soul Eater Medusa's Conspiracy. Soul Eater
6221320	6225880	is a pretty freakin' cool manga, what I've seen of it. There's also, um, yes, Pre-Care
6225880	6233640	Five Gogo Zen and Shugo Dream Carnival. Um, there's also, uh, some Tales of Heart stuff
6233640	6241280	going on. I really do want to see Macross Ace Frontier, and, um, there's also, uh, Tales
6241280	6250200	of the Radiant World mythology too. Also on PSP. Alrighty. Well cool. What about, uh,
6250200	6258240	Sega? Uh, it's just listed by systems. Oh, I'm sorry. That's alright. Okay. Well anyways,
6258240	6262560	um, we've got some, uh, interesting information. Uh, big surprise, because they seem to be
6262560	6269360	gobbling up all sorts of game store chains, but GameStop has now bought a brand new chain
6269360	6277640	in France, uh, for 700 million dollars, and they have gained 332 stores out of the deal.
6277640	6284600	And apparently, um, I don't know, the two stores that they, um, bought, I guess, uh,
6284600	6290920	the Gaming Guild and its, um, Navigators. I guess those are a chain. Oh, Micromania,
6290920	6298280	I'm sorry, is, uh, the French company. Micromania. Never heard of them, but of course I don't
6298280	6304740	live in France, so. Isn't that kind of scary though? There's like, they're seriously trying
6304740	6311960	to be like the McDonalds of fucking gaming. Uh, yeah, beware kids, um, you will be assimilated
6311960	6318240	into the GameStop collective, apparently. It's just a matter of time. I don't know about
6318240	6322360	you guys, but when I hear about GameStop taking over the world, it makes me a little bit angsty,
6322360	6327440	especially for the independent shops out there. And when I get angsty, we play the mean music
6327440	6346200	and say mean things. F.U.'s of the week time, Dark Sakura. And F.U. to me for forgetting
6346200	6350960	one of the stories that I had to do just a moment ago. And F.U. to Rob for not actually
6350960	6355720	telling me to do the story. I tried to drop a hint! Yeah, but I'm a little pissed off
6355720	6367120	right now. I'm a lot pissed off. Why? Because I need my... I hurt. Aww. So F.U. goes to
6367120	6376840	my hip hurting like really, really freaking bad, and um, F.U. to uh, stuff in general.
6376840	6383640	Damn that stuff. I know, stuff just sucks. Loki. F.U. to people that run red lights with
6383640	6389800	their cars. Um, I don't know, they think it's fun or something? Or they just say, forget
6389800	6395920	it, you know? Um, anyways, so yeah, they, there was a guy today, we're driving, and
6395920	6401240	he just, you know, right turn on a red, and just kind of didn't even stop, just, woo!
6401240	6406160	I'm going! And then he pulled right in front of me, and went super slow, just to add, you
6406160	6410720	know, insult to injury. And then, um, you know, there's numerous days where I see people
6410720	6415040	just blowing through red lights, like well after, you know, they've turned red, because
6415040	6419600	they're in a hurry. Well good, I hope you murder somebody, and end up in jail forever,
6419600	6425800	and sued, you know, for all the money that you have, all a few bucks of it, and um, you
6425800	6432760	rot in hell. That's it. Um, I wanna say F.U. to the Italian dinner I had last night, which
6432760	6437620	was not at Olive Garden, I went to another place, um, around here, and um, man, I don't
6437620	6441640	know what it was about the food, it was bad or something, because it's like World War
6441640	6450160	3 was occurring in my colon. It was really, really horrible, so uh, F.U. to that. I wonder
6450160	6454560	if I, like, ate uncooked meat or something, it was pretty terrible. I'm gonna do my story
6454560	6459000	now. You sure can do your story now. Uh, this is the list of stuff that Sega's gonna have
6459000	6464880	at Tokyo Game Show. Um, for Playstation 3 is Yakuza 3, Bayonetta, Sonic Unleashed. For
6464880	6471880	Wii is 4.28, Bleach vs. Crusade, the arrangement of Haruhi Suzumiya, another Haruhi, oh, I
6471880	6477480	like Haruhi. That's really cool. Sonic Unleashed, Samba de Amigo, Xbox 360 is Bayonetta, Sonic
6477480	6482920	Unleashed, DS is Mystery Dungeon, Shiro and the Wanderer, DS2, Demon Castle in the Desert,
6482920	6488360	Phantasy Star Zero, which is gonna be awesome, Infinite Space, 7th Dragon, Shining Force
6488360	6493440	Feather, that's another cool thing, Cold Accept DS, which actually someone IMed me the other
6493440	6499320	day saying, look, Cold Accept! I'm like, I don't like tactics games. Cold Accept's neat
6499320	6505200	though, cause it's like Monopoly meets, yeah, I like Cold Accept. Um, there's the Haruhi
6505200	6512200	game, um, Blazer Drive, World Destruction, um, Sakatsuka DS Touch and Direct, Kaite Obe,
6512200	6521600	oh, bleh, Kaite Oboeru Doragana, Doragana, Doragana. Okay. Garnet Chronicle, um, Crimson
6521600	6528080	Jen, Saigon PSP, Hatsune Miku, Project Diva, you know what that is, right? What? Virtual
6528080	6535400	Idol. Nice. Yep. And Phantasy Star Portable, and PC is getting Internet Adventure. Internet
6535400	6539560	Adventure? The Internet is an adventure. It is an adventure. Dude, that's okay, I want
6539560	6545300	the Hatsune Miku game. I totally want the Hatsune Miku game. Alright. Lots to look forward
6545300	6552720	to a Tokyo game show. Rob, we'll have to play some of the Vocaloid for people who don't
6552720	6556280	know what it is. Someday. That's why we have a Justin TV channel. Hey, uh, other games
6556280	6559840	coming out in the US, kinda coming away from Japan, coming back to the US, well I imagine
6559840	6563840	this game will come out in Japan as well at some point, but, we're getting it in the US
6563840	6568240	first, it's Fable 2, and a follow up to a story we had last week, remember how we talked
6568240	6572200	about that the co-op was gonna be delayed via a patch? Well, suddenly there's some backtracking
6572200	6579200	this week from the infamous Peter Molyneux, the Lionhead CEO, he is saying that the co-op
6579200	6584460	actually might be available at launch day. So now they're kinda going back and forth,
6584460	6589160	but this was said at some video at a game festival that was going on in Paris, he said
6589160	6595680	that Fable 2 will have the online co-op at launch, but he can't confirm that. But the
6595680	6602840	ambition is there, but just in case we prepare for disappointment. I'm not sure how exactly
6602840	6605960	I'm supposed to take that. It's only about a week of disappointment. I know, it'll be
6605960	6609840	all over within a week, which quite frankly I have enough games to play anyway, I don't
6609840	6613920	fuckin' need another one, but, I do still kinda want Fable 2, I gotta admit. You need
6613920	6618160	to play Saints Row 2. No I don't. Cause you can make all sorts of tranny characters and
6618160	6622000	like- Oh, cause that's why I play games, Loki, to make tranny characters. Exactly! Who doesn't
6622000	6626720	play games? That was a sexist comment. How was that sexist comment? Tranny is both sexist.
6626720	6638320	Cause you're- Fable 2 is getting a collector's edition, but it's slowly slipping away. Some
6638320	6643600	of the cards that were supposed to be in it, the figure and all this stuff, the box itself
6643600	6648640	is not actually going to be there. Oh, but the cards will. The cards will be there. But
6648640	6655280	here's the other weird thing. The cards are going to be there in a downloadable PDF format.
6655280	6660640	So you can print your own damn cards. I'm getting the feeling nobody pre-ordered the
6660640	6663760	collector's edition and that's why they're suddenly having to do this. I don't know what
6663760	6669720	it is. Did you? Yeah. How do you feel about the fact that it's suddenly like, disappearing?
6669720	6674360	I didn't give a shit about the cards or the DVD or anything, I just wanted like, the extra
6674360	6678640	weapons in it and stuff. And even then, you know, the only reason I'm buying it is because
6678640	6684000	I get a kickass discount, so it actually doesn't really cost me that much. You know, it's actually
6684000	6687400	cheaper than buying the retail version of the game. So wait a minute, even though you
6687400	6691540	were yelling at me to make trannies in Saints Row, you were actually going to be leaving
6691540	6696880	for a while to play Fable 2? No, I'm buying it now so I can play it after I'm doing Saints
6696880	6701660	Row 2, which will be for a while. My friend wants to play Fable 2 co-op, so you know,
6701660	6705200	that'd sound kinda like fun. That'd be fun. But then again, I want to play Saints Row
6705200	6710880	2 co-op, so I don't know. HendersonMam says, I wanted the Master Chief Outlet. Is that
6710880	6714900	the thing they're getting with the pre-order? Yes, that comes with the pre-order still.
6714900	6719240	There's like a lightsaber type of weapon or something that you get. There's also like
6719240	6725320	some additional dungeon or something that's coming. That's about it, and you get like
6725320	6729320	a bonus DVD with behind the scenes crap. I kinda wanted the figurine for my desk, and
6729320	6733120	that would've been kinda cool. I also have a regular version on order as well in case
6733120	6737680	I decide last minute I don't want, you know. Well, I have it on order at work. I mean,
6737680	6743080	I can cancel at any time. There's no $5 deposit for me, so. Cancel at any time. That's right.
6743080	6746200	Why don't you order like 50 of them and then cancel them all? Or will they get mad? They
6746200	6751640	get mad at that. Oh, I see. Alright. Well, that is coming out soon. Hey, speaking of
6751640	6756420	the Master Chief Outfit, completely random off-topic story. I went to a party store here
6756420	6760760	locally yesterday, and you know everybody's gearing up for Halloween, right? Did you know
6760760	6766120	they're selling a Halo 3 branded Master Chief Outfit? Have you seen that? I have seen that.
6766120	6769920	As something else. I was at a party store yesterday. Do you know what's really sad is
6769920	6774080	I was considering buying it, because I'm kinda pathetic. No. Well, it would be fun, wouldn't
6774080	6779440	it? No. Dressed up as a video game character? Especially one as well known as Master Chief?
6779440	6785260	What? Um, what? Um. You know tons of cosplayers, you wouldn't have a problem. True. I could
6785260	6789680	save that for an Iron Man convention. Our manager in Dallas, he has a kick-ass Halo.
6789680	6794760	I think he actually bought one of those Halo costumes, like a custom-made one or something.
6794760	6799840	He has, like, literally the full outfit. Rob should go as the, um, the king of the universe.
6799840	6803520	Uh, Deep Man. Oh, the king of the cosmos? That'd be hilarious. Actually, we're talking
6803520	6806680	about doing that as a Rocky Horror Gold scene at some point, if you even know what I'm talking
6806680	6812240	about. Um, Deep Man in chat, uh, live in our chatroom, chat.orangemanstrategy.com says,
6812240	6818080	uh, I saw that at Walmart yesterday here in Canada. So it's even at Walmart. Dan Shadow's
6818080	6822280	gonna be Dr. Horrible. That's a pretty good outfit. You know what I'm hearing is gonna
6822280	6827760	be a really popular outfit this year, I heard? Uh, Sarah Palin. I wouldn't doubt it. One
6827760	6832320	of my friends is going to Sarah. Uh, Deep Man says a lot of people won't cancel it regardless,
6832320	6839320	going back to the pre-order, speaking of that. There you go. Alright, so, Fable 2. I'll buy
6839320	6843080	it. It'll just be one of those games I only have 30 minutes to play. So, go figure. Oh,
6843080	6848160	Deep Man says my wife is going as Grunty from Banjo-Kazooie. You know what I saw as someone
6848160	6853240	made a costume or released a, uh, a guide on how to make it? They have a Sackboy costume
6853240	6857120	that someone made. Oh my. Oh yeah, I saw that. I saw that. I think I might actually want
6857120	6861800	to make that. That's cool. I don't have a costume to wear, and, uh, my wife is dressing
6861800	6872200	up as Darthina Vaderina, the, um, pink, Barbie-ish, secret girlfriend of Darth Vader. She's going
6872200	6879600	as Awful Mary Sue. It's, she's literally like, you know, um, she's dressing, or, it kinda
6879600	6885720	looks like, uh, like her cape's gonna be bedazzled and stuff like that. It's, it's ridiculous,
6885720	6890040	but, uh, funny. SSJ100Matt says I'm thinking of going as the Hebrew Hammer. That would
6890040	6893200	be funny. We'll have to ask this question again on our Twitter or something right before
6893200	6897400	Halloween. You know what? What? If, if I, if it wasn't so freakin' hot to wear and didn't
6897400	6902480	need to be, uh, taken in a bit, I'd wear my Organization 13 costume from YALIcon the other
6902480	6906200	year. I'm probably gonna recycle my Jack Skellington costume from last year, cuz seriously, I paid
6906200	6909440	good money for it. I need to wear it more than once. You know, I actually, though, I
6909440	6914080	really want someone, I, I need to redo the claw. I could do my bike-in costume. Oh, fun.
6914080	6918840	Show off my boobs. Alright. Not really. How about you show off the next gaming story?
6918840	6924840	How about I do just that? How about you do it. Um, well, for anyone who's been interested
6924840	6931840	in The Force Unleashed, you're getting some treats. You're getting, um, Luke and Obi-Wan,
6931840	6938240	which is pretty freakin' cool. You're also getting, um, uh, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Kit Fisto.
6938240	6946840	That sounds like a porn star name. Um, Kit Fisto! Fisting. Wow. It's actually a pretty
6946840	6954540	cool-looking character. Um, but also, um, there's supposed to be, um, new costumes and
6954540	6960680	a new mission, um, one for the Jedi Temple, and the, uh, apprentice will learn more about
6960680	6966640	his father, blah blah blah. Um, so you get more, uh, stuff. There's no dates left for
6966640	6974000	the, for the download content packs, but, um, it will be posted at some point, I guess.
6974000	6978960	Pretty game. Yeah, that, that Sackboy costume looks really easy to make. It's like a sweatshirt
6978960	6984320	in a garbage bag, or a garbage pail. You should wear a Kit Fisto costume. I'm not gonna wear
6984320	6987440	a Kit Fisto costume, but see, look at that. It just makes the head. Isn't that kinda cool?
6987440	6991120	That's cool. No, I saw that on, uh, bloggers in the last week. I'm gonna do that. Totally
6991120	6994560	gonna do that. I still think you should be Kit Fisto. What's Kit Fisto? I don't know,
6994560	7001240	it's just a funny name. Yeah, you're right, that is funny. Kit Fisto. Fisto. Fisto Ophirio.
7001240	7011400	Fisto, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Next story. So, uh, yeah. Apparently all that drama with,
7011400	7018000	uh, EA trying to buy Take-Two is made Take-Two say, hey, you know what? We're just gonna
7018000	7023240	be a bachelor for a long time. How about that? So they've decided that they're not going
7023240	7028640	to... We need a little me time. They're not gonna mate with any other game companies right
7028640	7033600	now, or merge with any of them. They're not gonna return your phone calls. They're not
7033600	7037360	calling you back, they're like, you know... They just want the one night stand, they're
7037360	7043080	gonna go, bye! They're like, it's not you, it's you. They're like, you know, when they're
7043080	7047040	getting up in the morning and, you know, whoever they're in bed with is saying, call me, you
7047040	7054480	know, Take-Two's just like, sure, yeah, I'll do that. I'll call you something. Alright,
7054480	7057960	well, too bad for those that were interested in Take-Two, I suppose, but, you know, good
7057960	7062080	for them, I guess, sticking to it, if they want to stay independent. Hey, on completely
7062080	7066320	different news, this is a game, another, god, another freaking game I want to get this year,
7066320	7070720	I'm just not gonna have time for. The Last Remnant. The Last Remnant, you know, it's coming
7070720	7075860	out worldwide. Japan, of course, one place that they really need to sell more Xbox 360s,
7075860	7078440	even though, you know, they've had a lot of good luck and some turnaround, thanks to Tales
7078440	7082240	of Vesperia. They're gonna try to do that even more with The Last Remnant. It's a special
7082240	7087920	Xbox 360 bundle that's gonna be coming out in Japan. This box is gonna come with a different
7087920	7094920	DVD remote, the game, a face plate, and a soundtrack CD. That's $331 for all that shit
7094920	7099440	together. It's about $30 off of what it would cost separately. And they're hoping that's
7099440	7104120	gonna push them over the million Xbox 360s sold in Japan, Mark, because that's pretty
7104120	7108880	big. And, you know, again, Tales of Vesperia has been very good at helping them get there.
7108880	7113440	A little bit infinite on discovery, too, as well. So, The Last Remnant, by the way, though,
7113440	7117680	is not, I should kind of step back a little bit, is not solely on the Xbox 360. It will
7117680	7122680	be coming out on the PlayStation 3, but later. So, Xbox 360 does get a little bit of an exclusive
7122680	7128800	window. So, there you go. That's a lot of stuff, too. Yep. So, if you're waiting in
7128800	7133480	Japan, now might be a good time. All right, now's a good time for us to go and open the
7133480	7138920	email bag. Every week, you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we
7138920	7142000	pick a few of our favorites to read here on the program, and that's what we're gonna do
7142000	7146080	right now. Dark Soccer's gonna dive in the mailbag and read some emails. How many emails
7146080	7152400	do we have tonight? Five. Five? Very on. All right. Let's make it quick. Five emails. Here
7152400	7158200	we go. Okay. The first one comes from Daniel. I swear this is going to be my last email
7158200	7162840	regarding Warhammer Online. I'm calling all MMO gamers to join the order on the Iron Fist
7162840	7170840	server. I'm trying to get a guild together, but because the hours I work 2 p.m. until
7170840	7173960	11 p.m. Monday through Saturday, thank you for telling us your hours. I will find out
7173960	7178880	where you work. Um, it's becoming difficult. I have a close group of experienced MMO gamers
7178880	7188000	on the server already, but we have all worked similar hours, so none of us are in-game during
7188000	7193560	peak hours. The game really requires you to be in a guild to get some extra bonuses. p.m.
7193560	7216000	Ball Hair with three L's. Okay, it's B-A-L-L-L-H-A-I-R. Or, Punky Dunch if interested. I like how these
7216000	7222360	guys are sending us an email about, look, we're on this roleplay server and we really
7222360	7229320	want our guild to be taken seriously. We can't figure out why people won't join our guild
7229320	7234680	and play this game with us. Maybe it's our work hours. I don't know. Please send a message
7234680	7250840	to Ball Hair. Rob is turning red in the face. This is cute. Rob. Look. Rob. I'm not. Rob.
7250840	7258800	Punky Dunch. That one's funny, too. Do you think that person might have just made this
7258800	7263600	whole story up just to get us to say those names on here? I think possibly that whole
7263600	7268160	thing was a trap to get you to say Ball Hair. You know what? I'll say Ball Hair anyway.
7268160	7279400	Ball Hair! I'll also say Sweaty Balls. Alright. I am not afraid to go there, Rob. Alright.
7279400	7285480	I know. You live there. You own a house there. P.S. LittleBigPlanet is insane. On the surface
7285480	7290000	it's a cute platformer but once you dive into the level builder you will be hooked. It is
7290000	7293920	difficult but addictive. One of my favorite things about it is the ability to borrow someone's
7293920	7298120	creations. If someone else makes a really cool figure or building you can borrow it
7298120	7302120	and put it on your own stages. Look on YouTube for some really cool creations. The Body Level
7302120	7309040	and Little Big Colossus are some of the more popular levels out there. That's from Daniel.
7309040	7315800	A.K.A. Ball Hair. Dan's in chat right now and says, no, it's real, I swear. So you should
7315800	7319840	sign all your letters, Ball Hair. He is Ball Hair the Dwarf. Ball Hair. He says, come on,
7319840	7324800	it's awesome. No, dude, it is awesome. That's the whole thing. It's just really funny. I'm
7324800	7329480	sorry just because the whole setup of the email and everything. So we have to have fan
7329480	7339840	fear for you to go, Ball Hair the Dwarf. Can I move on? Yes. Hi folks. I just had a few
7339840	7346720	questions for you. Maybe you might have some possible answers and slash or feedback. Considering
7346720	7351440	how retro gaming is on consoles nowadays as well as indie games, see Everyday Shooter,
7351440	7357280	Mega Man 9, XNA, etc. for reference. I have decided to make my own games for both the
7357280	7362440	360 and PS3. The catch is the last game I made was a borderline pornographic mod of
7362440	7369440	an Apple IIe edutainment game originally called Turtle Trot. Excuse me. What classes should
7369440	7373080	I take or alternatively, what books should I read and what programming languages should
7373080	7377760	I learn? Are most games using the C languages or a variation thereof? Dude, I have no fucking
7377760	7384120	clue. To actually learn how to write games? You should write them in BASIC. You know what
7384120	7389080	everybody does? And release it on the TI computer. Actually, that's not a bad point to the email
7389080	7393080	because I'll tell you, when I was in school studying computer science, C++ was where you
7393080	7396360	started. It's one of those things where you have to start somewhere. I mean, programming
7396360	7401960	languages aren't that much different. I mean, they are and they aren't. I mean, the way
7401960	7408920	you learn, shut up. The way you learn languages is that whole logic if then and building flow
7408920	7413600	charts in your mind. And any language is going to be a foot in the door at that. But if you
7413600	7419200	want something to be practical and learn something, you go with C or the languages that are really
7419200	7427440	out there. Rob, I have to say something. What's that? Yeah, my flow chart is in my mind. There
7427440	7433980	you go. As for the rest of the email? Yes. In case you're wondering, I'm looking to develop
7433980	7438480	games that have the look and feel of old school 8 and 16 bit arcade and console games. This
7438480	7444320	catch is that A, they're simple to pick up and learn, B, difficult to master, C, fun,
7444320	7448920	and D, they have my goofy corny off the wall sense of humor injected into them. An example
7448920	7452640	would be an NPC in an adventure game complaining about being forced to pace back and forth
7452640	7457000	in a certain path and saying the same thing over and over again to Avengers. In a fit
7457000	7460760	of rage or fed up, he declares that he quits and orders the gaming gods to take his job
7460760	7468420	and shove it. That came from Spazinator, by the way. Wait, what was the question in there?
7468420	7472240	What games have that type of... That's what he said is goals for making the games. Oh,
7472240	7478500	I see. I don't know, Loki, you're probably the closest thing we have on staff to a programmer.
7478500	7483460	What are your thoughts on this? For someone that doesn't program, I'm pretty good with...
7483460	7487320	You hack and stuff, but I don't know. Do you have any thoughts on this? He hacks with a
7487320	7493200	butter knife. Well, I mean, if you're trying to get into it professionally, I guess, then
7493200	7501360	C would be good or Visual Basic or something like that. Probably, if you're just doing
7501360	7507840	it for fun and you want to do something like that, there's Game Maker 7. I don't know if
7507840	7512520	you've seen, there was that Mario game that had the Mega Man levels and all that crazy
7512520	7516720	shit in it. That was made with Game Maker 7. So you can actually make full games out
7516720	7520640	of it and distribute them to your friends and that kind of thing. And that's what you're
7520640	7528920	interested in doing. But yeah, that's pretty much it. That's Bobby. I don't know. Good
7528920	7534560	luck to you. Pass off the blame. Next email? Yes, next email. Hello, cast of OLR, especially
7534560	7539200	Loki. I just wanted to tell the listeners and you guys about something cool for the
7539200	7542620	PC, which I've read this email and we pretty much know about. First of all, I'm sure Loki
7542620	7547200	has heard about Fretz on Fire. It's a free Guitar Hero game for the PC. If you have an
7547200	7551160	Xbox 360, you can plug in your wired controller into your computer, download a driver for
7551160	7555280	it, and play this game just like Guitar Hero 3. Also, the wireless ones work too. You just
7555280	7559880	have to buy a special wireless receiver for your computer. If you have a Guitar Hero controller
7559880	7563240	for PS2 and other systems that's wired, you can get a converter that will allow you to
7563240	7572040	plug in these controllers and play. Lastly, if you decide to get this game, at first it
7572040	7577480	sucks because the game itself has a lot of bugs, which makes it bad, and it looks nothing
7577480	7582220	like Guitar Hero 3, but if you get it, download the Olarian mod because it's designed to make
7582220	7585720	it look and feel just like Guitar Hero 3. The best thing about this game is that you
7585720	7590320	can add your own songs and download ones made by other people. Lastly, all of the real gaming
7590320	7595200	companies like Activision and Harmonix have released song packs for each of their games
7595200	7599480	that are exactly the same as the real ones. That makes me laugh because Guitar Hero 3
7599480	7603080	is on PC, but you can just download the songs for Fronts on Fire and play them for free,
7603080	7607440	so please check it out. This is from Blade 3. It's basically like StepMania, but for
7607440	7612680	Guitar Hero. PS, sorry this email is so long, thanks for reading it. PSS, I hope I passed
7612680	7617280	the Grammar Nazis test. No, you didn't because you didn't fluctuate that sentence, and the
7617280	7622280	last one was run on sentence, and also Nazi is spelled N-A-Z-I, but not with a T. They
7622280	7626520	also have a game called Guitar Fun on the Wii that's basically the same thing, and you
7626520	7631360	can use that for like home brew stuff, plus now the new version has USB support, so you
7631360	7639080	can use your USB guitars, I think for Rock Band, and then you can also use USB keyboards
7639080	7643040	if you want to, and that's also available, and I think you can do two player on that.
7643040	7649240	You can also do playing over the internet with that game as well, Guitar Fun, so that's
7649240	7653840	kind of cool, and I think Fronts on Fire can do the same thing, but yeah, I mean it's got
7653840	7657640	a big community, they've got all the Rock Band songs, all the Guitar Hero songs available
7657640	7662640	to download in packs and stuff, so if you like, you know, StepMania, and you're now
7662640	7669560	moving on from DDR to Guitar Hero, this is probably something you'll be interested in.
7669560	7676680	May I continue? You may. I shall. Hello, this is Hephaestus in chat. When the time zones
7676680	7681440	align themselves appropriately, I have a bone to pick. Two games came out this past week
7681440	7686160	that I'm totally into and have heard zero mention of them. Pipe Mania, which I recognize
7686160	7690880	is a remake of the Game Boy game that I played incessantly, and My Boyfriend. Wait, is that
7690880	7694960	the old, old-ass game? It's the one I mentioned, no, I mentioned this last week, yes, it's
7694960	7699040	a remake of Pipe Dream. Okay, I was gonna say, that game is like, god, they had the
7699040	7703840	game on the Commodore 64, that shit is old school. I mean, it's a very simple puzzle,
7703840	7711240	it's like Tetris. It's also like Bioshock's hacking. Ah, yes, yes, it is. Well, to continue?
7711240	7717000	Sorry. Um, I'd never heard of the video game My Boyfriend, but it came out this week. I'm
7717000	7721480	sure it can't be as bad as Imagine Babies or whatever horrible crime against grammar
7721480	7725880	Ubisoft perpetrated against the English language while concocting the spelling of that game's
7725880	7730720	name, and yes, she did spell it correctly. And regardless, the game is called My Boyfriend
7730720	7736380	and apparently the game lets the player as a teenage girl have her first boyfriend. Now
7736380	7740160	that I haven't heard of. Maybe I can play as a boy, and that would make it the most
7740160	7744640	awesome game ever. While your news is usually awesome and definitely entertaining to listen
7744640	7749040	to, I just wanted to point out these two horrible omissions in your release sources. Thanks,
7749040	7754500	Hephaestus. I mentioned Pipe Mania last time we did releases, and yes, I did mention the
7754500	7758560	exact same stuff. It's a remake of Pipe Dream, and it's the same thing as like the hacking
7758560	7762040	in it. I remember specifically saying that, because I have to sell this crap, so. I think
7762040	7766440	I kinda wanna play that one though, because it makes me think of Tokimeki Girlside. Well,
7766440	7770400	if you wanna, let's see, if you wanna, whether games or people are gonna accuse me of forgetting
7770400	7776040	to mention Gravity, which is a game that's gonna be coming out that's kinda like the,
7776040	7782520	was it Pocket Physics game that's out now? Dude, that sounds cool. There's also. I like
7782520	7786280	physics. There's also a crappy Rubik's World game that's coming out later on that's like
7786280	7791560	Rubik's Cube stuff, but they're trying to make it like expanded and it's gonna be like
7791560	7798440	a puzzle game and stuff. I'm trying to think of what else that people might be remotely
7798440	7802280	interested in. Rubik's Cube yourself by peeling off the stickers. I don't know, I just mentioned
7802280	7807220	everything. You know, I don't miss a thing. Hephaestus is in chat right now and says,
7807220	7811120	by the way, my boyfriend is totally a bad GTA clone. Didn't we, I wanna say there was
7811120	7814800	a story about this a long, long time ago on the show, like when it was in development.
7814800	7818400	Yeah. Okay, yeah, sorry. The company that made my boyfriend apparently also made a PC
7818400	7824000	game called So Blonde. I did, I wanna say it came up a long time ago. Yeah, I do remember
7824000	7827520	that. There was something, cause we were making fun of it and almost the same jokes are coming
7827520	7831600	up now, like Frisbee says in the game, you can make sandwiches. That's how you get a
7831600	7837280	boyfriend, cook him something. Isn't that right, DarkSakura? Dude, I found my man on
7837280	7842120	the internet. I downloaded him. And then I had to fly out here and now I have to put
7842120	7846480	up with him every day. And us now. Cause if you had moved out here, you would never have
7846480	7850600	met me. If not for, if not for my husband, I would never have been the internet celebrity
7850600	7856920	I am today. There you go. Or Zach Deft calls him Edan. He facilitates my rock and roll
7856920	7864760	lifestyle. Or lack thereof. So, last email? Yes, last email. Dear OLR. Oh, we're dear.
7864760	7868260	I would just like to say that yesterday's show, the 28th, was my first time listening
7868260	7874080	live while interacting with the chat room. I had previously listened live on one other
7874080	7878400	occasion. I would just like to say that the whole experience of listening live while chatting
7878400	7883360	with the OLR listeners takes this amazing show to a whole new level. It really is something
7883360	7886920	every listener should experience because it's so unique and makes the show that much more
7886920	7891760	fun and interactive. If this gets read on air, this statement needs to be made. If you
7891760	7896400	love the podcast and only listen via the podcast, you're doing yourself a disservice by not
7896400	7901520	experiencing all the OLR has to offer. There's also some post-show goodness to be found on
7901520	7905440	occasion, which is definitely also worth your time. Well, thank you. God, you'd think we'd
7905440	7908880	paid somebody to write that. That's very sweet. I know we didn't because we don't have any
7908880	7915760	money. Exactly. We used that all up in Seattle. At the risk of sounding like a complete suck-up,
7915760	7922400	I'm going to end the email, but first, I would just like to remind the OLR staff how awesome
7922400	7927220	they are and reiterate that every listener should go to the chat room sometime. I know
7927220	7931240	I will be listening live and chatting every week that I'm able, so here's hoping everyone
7931240	7938060	listens live, SonicM88. By the way, I have to commend your spelling and your grammar.
7938060	7944400	It's beautiful. It's freaking gorgeous. A rare compliment. See, that's how you get dark
7944400	7949320	soccer to kiss your ass is kiss her ass. Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I actually
7949320	7953880	because you know, I'm used to, and I, I, it's kind of hard. I don't catch it for so much
7953880	7957400	of myself, but I catch it in other people's writing because I've gotten kind of used to
7957400	7963640	being the beta reader, but, um, wow. This is actually very, very well done. Thank you.
7963640	7966840	Um, my face is actually actually good. Good question. Chat. What about whatever happened
7966840	7971080	to the midday show for the European listeners? We still need to do that. So probably it's
7971080	7975920	not probably realistically not going to happen until after 300 and I don't know how much
7975920	7980080	I want to get into this now until I know some details, but, um, I'm going to be off for
7980080	7984640	like several shows in a row because I'm having surgery. If you've been listening to the show,
7984640	7989800	I just don't know when the, when is the big question. I'm having a pancreas. No, I not.
7989800	7995520	I, well, no, he's having a duodenum ectomy, but if I get the gallbladder out, which is
7995520	8001680	having a stomach, shut up. I'm getting a face job. Uh, but no, I'm going to have the gallbladder
8001680	8004400	out, which is very common. I'm sure plenty of our listeners have had it done. I'm not
8004400	8007240	that worried about it except for the fact that it's just surgery, but you know, there's
8007240	8010760	going to be a recovery time and I have no OLR for me while I'm recovering. So probably
8010760	8014080	at least two, if not three weeks, I'm going to be out. Um, so I don't know what's going
8014080	8020000	to happen to the show during that time. Oh, Jesus Christ. But, um, yeah, something will
8020000	8024400	have to buy. I'm not missing episode 300. We will put this damn show on hiatus at two
8024400	8028540	99 if I'm having the surgery in two weeks, which I don't think I am. Well, we'll figure
8028540	8031760	out something. We'll figure something out. We always do. We'll bring the computer in
8031760	8038160	to Rob's bedside, live from surgery, live from my bedroom. We'll put your surgery on
8038160	8043200	Justin TV. That would be just, it would be almost Shakespearean to have episode 300 from
8043200	8051480	the hospital. I don't know why. We should, we should, we should totally seriously webcast
8051480	8057360	your surgery. I'm not Katie Couric for fuck's sake. All right. Seg says need a guest host.
8057360	8061520	Well, we always, we always want guests. So come up, be on the show. I think Bobby should
8061520	8066000	fly out here. All right. So that's, that's the end of the segment tonight. Yes. For the
8066000	8070360	mailbag. Yes. All right. We want to thank our sponsor for tonight. Let's fly Ciara back
8070360	8073960	out here. We want to thank tonight's sponsor for our mailbag segment is going to be our
8073960	8101560	guest host. Give it up for tonight's sponsor. Everybody. I don't get it. No, just kidding.
8101560	8105000	I do get it. All right, good. I was going to say, don't make me explain it to you. All
8105000	8107920	right, let's move on to a couple more gaming news stories and we're going to open up the
8107920	8115320	Skype line and hopefully we'll get some calls. So there's plenty of ways to save money with
8115320	8120000	your car insurance, but there may be a new way soon, especially if you're of the old
8120000	8131560	variety. Apparently there is Allstate and they're I guess testing a new, I guess a new
8131560	8138200	video game product for PCs that they're going to give to 100,000 customers in Pennsylvania
8138200	8145120	between the ages of 50 and 75. The games are basically different tests. Kind of think of
8145120	8153260	like almost like brain training a little bit. They test for visual alertness and also kind
8153260	8159320	of just different reflex tests and that kind of stuff. And they're seeing if the performance
8159320	8164760	in that game correlates to how safe the drivers are. And if they find that to be true, then
8164760	8170160	you may get, you know, discounts based on how well you perform in a game or how often
8170160	8176320	you play said game. I hope they do the tests on Crazy Taxi. Crazy Taxi? That'd be awesome.
8176320	8184160	Are you ready to save some crazy money? That's like a future Geico commercial right there.
8184160	8190760	Wow, who knew some video games might actually save me money in the future? Do you think
8190760	8194600	this is really going to happen though or is this like one of the things where like so
8194600	8198920	and so says something to so and so and now it's like fact? It's less of a game, more
8198920	8206160	of like software. I wouldn't even call it a game. All right. Hey, we are going to be
8206160	8212880	opening the Skype line very soon to your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is
8212880	8218040	Orange Lounge Radio. So you definitely should be adding us on there. But first, we have
8218040	8224320	one more story for you tonight about what else? The most important video game of the
8224320	8236840	21st century. Of course, I mean SingStar ABBA. It is being released on December 2nd and the
8236840	8241800	track listings have been announced. There are going to be 20 tracks on the PlayStation
8241800	8252200	2 for $30, 25 tracks on the PlayStation 3 for $40. And yes, Dancing Queens on both.
8252200	8257040	Some of the highlights from both track lists, Chiquiquita, Gimme Gimme Gimme a Man After
8257040	8264920	Midnight, Take a Chance on Me, SOS, Dancing Queen, Fernando, I Do I Do I Do, Knowing Me
8264920	8270040	Knowing You, The Winner Takes It All, Mamma Mia, Money Money Money, and of course, Waterloo.
8270040	8274120	Some of the exclusives on the PlayStation 3 that you will not see on the PlayStation
8274120	8279380	2, if you were curious, I know I was, Under Attack, When All is Said and Done, which by
8279380	8284200	the way is my favorite ABBA song ever, and Head Over Heels, and Happy New Year, and The
8284200	8290300	Day Before You Came are the five. So that goes out to all two of you that care about
8290300	8295800	that news. But I'm telling you, this game is going to be epic in so many ways. I care
8295800	8302080	too. Rob, when's it coming out in the US? December 2nd. You know what, Rob? I might
8302080	8308840	have to pick it up. I'm going to pick it up. You already know, my PlayStation 3, I told
8308840	8315720	America, and the world, I told the world, not just America, I told the world, I will
8315720	8321220	buy the PlayStation 3 when that one game comes out that I have to have. And it is coming
8321220	8325280	December 2nd. It's not even Final Fantasy. Well, there's Little Big Planet 2, but there's
8325280	8329360	Sing Star ABBA. See, you're going to come play that at my house too. This is a life
8329360	8334520	or death scenario. I better be better from surgery by the time Sing Star ABBA comes out.
8334520	8341020	My surgery is scheduled for December 2nd. God hates me. That's what it is. And the chat
8341020	8349280	room is demanding a Justin TV special. I can't speak for Dark Sakura, and I certainly can't
8349280	8356980	speak for Loki. Yes, you can. And Loki says no. But I will do a Justin TV special even
8356980	8361400	if I have to get my fabulous friends over here to play the game with me, like Extifer,
8361400	8367680	and Irene, and Victoria, and some of the fabulous friends. Get me drunk enough, I'll do it.
8367680	8371920	Now, Deep Man asks a good point. Why can't these just be DLC for the current Sing Star?
8371920	8378040	That actually isn't a bad question. But something as momentous as ABBA deserves its own release.
8378040	8383820	Don't you think? I mean, shit. If a little podunk band like ACDC, a little band that
8383820	8390960	nobody's heard of called Aerosmith, this no-name thing out of the Bay Area named Metallica,
8390960	8396840	if they can all get their games, why can't ABBA have their own damn game? I still have
8396840	8403000	to give you your record. Yes, you do. When Ron Mo is here, he got Rob an ABBA album.
8403000	8406840	That's amazing, by the way. Got him Super Trooper. That's amazing. That's what's going
8406840	8412920	in the blank spot. Um, pinball. Alright. Maybe we'll just rearrange. I mean, some of these,
8412920	8416680	I mean, Pop'n Music 11. How old is that? I can come now. That is still cute. You should
8416680	8420120	give that to me. The other one is Autograph. You know this Dear Friends poster? I don't
8420120	8423440	know if it comes through on Just TV, but there's no Bully Motz's autograph right there. That's
8423440	8426960	something my friends got me. I should put my Gorillaz poster up there. Maybe you should.
8426960	8431200	Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls. Hey, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
8431200	8436000	Who's this? Hey, it's Ron Mo again. What's up, everyone? Hey, Ron Mo. Ron Mo, what's
8436000	8445000	your favorite ABBA song? I don't have one. What? Get off my show! I'm just kidding. Hey!
8445000	8448800	I'm just kidding. You better find one before December 2nd. Alright, no, just kidding. What's
8448800	8453840	on your mind for real, DJ Ron Mo? Something different. I want everyone's opinion in the
8453840	8460480	studio about this. As some of you know, I work, I go to cons and I sell hentai video
8460480	8465520	games. Now, we're thinking about changing the packaging design to make it look more
8465520	8471000	like, you know, normal like Wii, PS2, PS3 boxes. I had said that I don't think that's
8471000	8476880	a very good idea because we'd have to deal with the ESRB who would want the games rated
8476880	8483600	and it would just go into just a very bad mess. And my thing is, I don't think that
8483600	8489500	these adult hentai games should be like in stores or anything like that. I mean, how
8489500	8494040	would you feel if you walked into a GameStop or Target or Walmart and saw these games on
8494040	8498880	the store shelves? Hold up. I would be delighted. Actually, yeah, that would be awesome, actually.
8498880	8504640	Can you back up to square one a minute? You sell hentai games? Yeah. Are you redistributing
8504640	8507800	them from another person or what is this? I didn't know you wrote games. What the hell
8507800	8512760	is this? We redistribute them from a company called Jlist. Oh, okay, cool. I know Jlist.
8512760	8519080	I've ordered lots of snacks from them. I think you're okay designing box art that's similar.
8519080	8523680	I mean, honestly, if you want good examples of parody, go to the porn industry. That's
8523680	8528040	kind of what you're going to have to do for these games. Do you know? Hey, wait, hold
8528040	8533920	on. What? Random porno fact here. Did you know, remember that Not the Bradys thing that
8533920	8539440	they had? They have Not the Munsters now. It's a porno Munsters movie. We have a house
8539440	8545720	not another porn movie. All right, look, look. I think you can get away with certain things
8545720	8551280	under parody. I mean, I would just be cautious using the same color scheme and using a lot
8551280	8555840	of those things and not making, but there's nothing to stop you from doing like, you know,
8555840	8560120	what's a color they don't use in games? Like purple, you know, purple is kind of a passion
8560120	8563720	color. Put a purple bar on the top and on the bottom that has the company and you can
8563720	8568320	certainly put it in a DVD shaped case. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean, that's what
8568320	8572440	we do now. Yeah. So why not does that? Yeah, you could design something, come up with something
8572440	8577540	unique, but you could certainly do something that's consistent across the hentai land so
8577540	8581960	that, you know, when you see the purple border on the top of a certain shape or whatever,
8581960	8586280	you know, you're getting, so why exactly are you quality J list hentai? Now, why exactly
8586280	8591640	are you redesigning the packaging in the first place? Well, we feel that if we can convince
8591640	8595520	J list to redesign the packages, the games would sell better. Cause if you look at it,
8595520	8599160	cause if you look at the games that we sell now, they look like normal DVD box arts, you
8599160	8603040	know, like normal movies. But if you pick it up and look like something like a game
8603040	8607840	box, it would probably be more appealing. But most game boxes are just basically DVD
8607840	8612880	cases. What you need to do, design something consistent, like, you know, like a purple
8612880	8618160	bar along the top, that's in like a pixel art or something, you know, uh, uh, J what
8618160	8622760	it, what do they, do they have a name for the series? Well, they're different hentai
8622760	8629240	titles. That's just it. What's the name of a hentai title? One of them is, um, Amorous
8629240	8633480	Professor Cherry. That's one of the games that we sell. All right. Sexy Professor Series
8633480	8637200	or something like that along the top. And like a pixel-y type art that makes me think
8637200	8643560	of video games. That could work, but I'm just more worried about the fact that expanding
8643560	8648720	that the ESRB may be like, hey, you're selling PC games without our, um, rating, you know,
8648720	8652240	we don't want to deal with that. You don't put their rating on it. You're not making
8652240	8655280	the games. They don't give a shit. And you're not, you're not big enough. They're not going
8655280	8659920	to notice. As long as you make it. That's what I said. As long as it's very clear on
8659920	8665440	the box, not for children, you'll be fine. You've got to have it somewhere on the box
8665440	8670760	very clear, not for children. Of course, like if the box art is like a dick going in a pussy,
8670760	8673760	I don't think that, I think that's going to get the message. No, no, no. That's on the
8673760	8683600	inside. Okay. Are the fronts like rather artistic? Yes, they're very artistic. Hey, wait a minute.
8683600	8686920	We should, we should get some of these games. What they need to do is have like embossed
8686920	8693320	packaging, especially around the boobular area. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you guys what.
8693320	8697920	We do have some open copies. I can send you guys in sky. I have some Yowie titles for
8697920	8705880	you. Yes. Look, who's really excited about the Yowie titles. Did you hear that? No. You
8705880	8710360	know what? Again, I'll review them for the show. Rama, here's my advice. You can do the
8710360	8714200	DVD packaging. It's on a small enough scale. I don't think they're going to care. Don't
8714200	8718640	flat out copy what the big boys are doing. Come up with something similar. Nothing like
8718640	8724040	that. Yeah. All right. There you go. And some of the chat room wants to see some of this
8724040	8728840	art. Well, we're still working on the design. Once we get them up, let's see if I post them
8728840	8731960	to the site so you can get everyone's opinion on it. Cause I do like the fact that we can
8731960	8737280	make them look more like video game style boxes, but I'm just fearing that a parent's
8737280	8742240	going to see this and just flip a shit. You know what you ought to do? And my director's
8742240	8747120	like, maybe we can get these in the game stuff. I'm like, uh-uh. No. Yeah, no, they're not
8747120	8749640	going to want to carry out, but you might be able to get into indie game stores. You
8749640	8753480	never know with back rooms. Hey, here's my thought though. Honestly, I know it's going
8753480	8757400	to sound crazy, but go back in the game in gaming's history and look at some of the box
8757400	8761680	art that came out for games like Custer's revenge or even on the completely opposite
8761680	8765400	end of the spectrum. Go look at like some of the box art for like Bible adventures and
8765400	8768720	some of those games that came out on the NES because those games were unauthorized. Correct.
8768720	8772840	They were not official Nintendo products. Correct. And some of the color dreams games,
8772840	8778080	you might find some inspiration. No. All right. Well, Rama, we got to let you go though, but
8778080	8781200	good luck with the business. You're doing, you're doing a great thing for the community.
8781200	8786860	Oh, we definitely do. Oh, and Rob, before I go, I know you and Jamie like, um, rumble
8786860	8792720	roses. There is a porn version of that available. Nice. Yeah, it's called ready to rumble. Nice.
8792720	8798200	I want to see that. Is there a hentai podcast? Probably. I know my podcast gets a little
8798200	8803480	bit hentai-ish at times. You know what? I think there is one. I think, I don't know
8803480	8806400	if this guy listens anymore, but I remember way, way, way back in the day when we first
8806400	8809960	first started podcasting, we were doing the to go stuff, right? There was a guy who ended
8809960	8814320	up starting a hentai podcast because we got referrals from his site. I remember that.
8814320	8819480	So, um, there's at least a hentai podcast, but a hentai gaming podcast, that might be
8819480	8824440	a niche that needs to be discovered. My friend. Well, I might have to start reviewing them
8824440	8828720	on my own podcast then. Huh? All right. There you go. Yeah. All right. We got to let you
8828720	8831440	go around. I have a good one, buddy. Thanks a lot. Y'all have a good one. You're a true
8831440	8837680	American company that made Custer's Revenge. I have a friend named Mystique. Oh, Mystique
8837680	8842840	Entertainment. Yeah. Yeah. I met Mystique, right? Yeah. I did. The Amazonian girl. Yes.
8842840	8847840	She was nice. She is. She's great. She's fun. But the box is so funny. It is very funny.
8847840	8851320	See, but it's, it's, it's shaped like a normal Atari box. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8851320	8859320	Who's this? Hi folks. Uh, this is Spazinator. I'm sorry. What was your name again? Spazinator.
8859320	8865000	Spazinator. What's on your mind Spazinator? Uh, not much. Uh, there was two questions
8865000	8874280	I neglected to put into my email, um, that I just thought of. Um, first off, uh, considering
8874280	8880440	that, uh, Street Fighter II, Hyper Fighting, and Samurai Shodown II are both available
8880440	8887520	for Xbox Live Arcade. These posters achieved a chance that Super Street Fighter II, you
8887520	8894040	know, Turbo, and Samurai Shodown IV, Abacuscus Revenge will eventually come out for Xbox
8894040	8900120	Live Arcade, or no? Where there is money to be made, they will make it. But, aren't they
8900120	8903600	doing the Super Street Fighter II High Def thing? That is coming out on Xbox Live. The
8903600	8907760	Super Street Fighter II High Def remix. They're doing that. Um, I don't know about Samurai
8907760	8910840	Shodown IV so much, though. It really depends on how the other one sells. That's what it
8910840	8917320	is. Yeah. Well, honestly, to be honest with you, I think that, at least with, uh, the
8917320	8922160	Samurai Shodown series, uh, the fourth game is probably the best in the series, to be
8922160	8926800	honest with you. But, that's just one person's opinion. But, you know what else is selling,
8926800	8930320	though, are those compilations. And you never know. One of those is probably going to come
8930320	8934200	out at some point for Xbox 360, because they have them on PlayStation 2. Why not? You know,
8934200	8938720	there's people that buy that stuff, like candy. So, you know, even if it doesn't show up in
8938720	8944720	Arcade, you'll probably see it in a compilation down the line. Possibly, yeah. Um. What was
8944720	8951400	the other question? Um, now, you know, considering that, uh, you know, next year, sometime next
8951400	8959160	year in the United States, uh, to come out with, uh, was the DSi. Now, these posts that,
8959160	8965720	for someone that's only gotten, uh, the DS Lite, uh, within the past few months, and
8965720	8971560	really only got it for, sort of, third-party games, like, uh, the Final Fantasy remakes
8971560	8977280	and Gene Albert rewards and whatnot, do you suppose there's any, you know, you know, good
8977280	8984680	reason for someone to upgrade to the DSi, or should we just stick to the DS Lite? Well,
8984680	8988800	this is interesting. Systems like the DSi are kind of starting to blur the line of our
8988800	8992240	golden rule of gaming, and we've said this a million times on the show, but the golden
8992240	8996880	rule of gaming is, a system is only as good as the games that are on it. So, if there
8996880	9001120	are games that are going to take advantage of the DSi's features that you absolutely
9001120	9005920	have to have the DSi for, um, you know, it just depends what you like. You know Nintendo's
9005920	9009360	going to come out with something. There's going to be that camera game, like Pokemon
9009360	9013360	Snap Real Life or something, that's going to take advantage of some of those features,
9013360	9017240	um, on the DSi that's, that's going to make you want it. That doesn't mean you have to
9017240	9021300	go out and buy one, buy one right away. But the reason why I say that line is starting
9021300	9025320	to be blurred a little bit is because look at systems like the PSP that don't really
9025320	9031240	just focus on gaming, whereas, like, the fact that PSP plays games is kind of a sideshow
9031240	9034760	to the fact that it surfs the internet, it downloads podcasts, you can, you know, do
9034760	9038160	all this other stuff with it and interface with your PlayStation 3 on top of everything
9038160	9042280	else. Um, it's made things very interesting. So, I think you also have to ask yourself
9042280	9048240	if there's not any games I want day one, do I really need that camera? Would I take pictures
9048240	9053700	to justify it? Or is the camera I have on my cell phone good enough? Do I want the applications
9053700	9057680	that are going to be in the store? Or do I already have what I really want on my iPhone?
9057680	9061560	I don't think we know enough about the system yet to really answer these questions. I think
9061560	9067000	there's definitely the oohs and aahs factors going on there. But the problem is, the camera,
9067000	9071320	we've seen it before. The downloadable content, we've seen it before. Everything they're
9071320	9075360	putting into the DSi, we've seen before, we just haven't seen Nintendo do it. So the
9075360	9080280	question is, how is Nintendo going to do this and make it their own? And I think that's
9080280	9085040	really what has to be demonstrated. Anybody have anything else you want to add to that?
9085040	9092880	Yeah, not to go poo-pooing on Nintendo or anything, but... Oh, why not? I was poo-pooing
9092880	9100520	on a Murphy car. I kind of got away from Nintendo over the past ten years, simply because, at
9100520	9109080	least with the F64, they have had not too great of a game lineup. Now, they have a handful
9109080	9120040	of games, but it's not overly great. It goes with the GameCube and even, to a certain extent,
9120040	9126600	even with the Wii. I mean, yeah, the Wii is good for like the retro games and whatnot,
9126600	9130760	but aside from that, I don't think what to use for it.
9130760	9134080	Spaznator, the simplest way I can say this is that there's going to be that game you're
9134080	9140000	going to want the DSi for eventually, but that happens to the best of us. You know what?
9140000	9144800	It is going to be the same damn thing. Mark my words, one or two years from now, it is
9144800	9149740	going to be the same damn thing because they're going to announce Wii HD or some shit that's
9149740	9153920	going to be like, it'll play all your old Wii games, but it also now has the HD graphics
9153920	9157840	and everything they were missing that Xbox had on them before. We're probably like a
9157840	9160960	year or two away from here and something like that, and it's going to be the same question.
9160960	9165240	Do I really need to get one the first day, or does that game I have to have, is that
9165240	9166240	a ways out?
9166240	9175960	Yeah, ironically, I think I've heard either on Tech of the Show or X-Play within the past
9175960	9186080	couple days that Nintendo has actually finally announced or leaked some information about
9186080	9190200	like a Wii 2 or Wii HD.
9190200	9194400	It was some dude that quit EGM and one up or whatever. He's a former editor that made
9194400	9195400	that comment.
9195400	9200380	And to be honest, that type of rumor shows up every six months. I mean, let's face reality.
9200380	9205000	Will Nintendo make another video game system? Fuck yes, they will. They've done extremely
9205000	9209120	well with Wii. Yes, they're going to make another video game system. Will Nintendo make
9209120	9213280	the system backwards compatible? Yes, they will. It was a big selling point of the Wii,
9213280	9217640	was the fact that they had all the GameCube games available. So the fact that there will
9217640	9222720	be another video game system from Nintendo is not news. It's really not. I don't know
9222720	9230840	why all these, there will be another, whether they call it Wii or Wii 2 or, you know, Turkey
9230840	9236320	Butt. It doesn't matter what they call it. I vote Turkey Butt. There will be some new
9236320	9237320	Nintendo system.
9237320	9240480	Yeah, we could go out and trademark that name, Turkey Butt, the game system.
9240480	9243200	Yeah, but hey, we all laughed at Wii.
9243200	9244200	Yeah.
9244200	9251320	Dude, there's a new Mario game coming out on Turkey Butt. Oh, there you go.
9251320	9257000	Yeah, honestly, I still give Nintendo a whole lot of crap about Wii. You know, I mean, it
9257000	9261520	sounds like, you know, like you're telling someone about, they're about to use their
9261520	9266360	restroom or, you know, you're suddenly, you know, trying to speak French or something.
9266360	9269240	Maybe both, I don't know.
9269240	9273720	Right. Well, Spazinator, good luck in your quest for the DSi. You know what? You don't
9273720	9277560	have to decide right now. We're not getting it for a year anyway. Honestly, I would not
9277560	9282480	import them unless like I had no digital camera or, you know, I don't know. But then again,
9282480	9285800	Loki's really big on the whole. I want to exploit that SD card best I can. So maybe
9285800	9290320	I can see that angle too. But for me, you have a lot of time to decide this. So good
9290320	9293560	luck to you. We'll keep bringing you the updates though on what games are going to release.
9293560	9294560	So take care, buddy.
9294560	9301080	All right, you too. Thanks for the call. Bye-bye. All right. Let's take another call. Hi, you're
9301080	9303400	on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9303400	9305000	This will be the one and only Dark Knight.
9305000	9307600	Hey, Dark Knight. What's on your mind, my friend?
9307600	9308600	Hello.
9308600	9312440	Talking about the DSi thing, talk about the innovation. And I remember you made a mistake
9312440	9316520	earlier calling the DSi phone. Watch it. It'll probably end up being the next thing they'll
9316520	9317520	probably do.
9317520	9324360	Yeah. Well, it's just a matter of time. Tons of fucking people own a DS. I mean, really.
9324360	9328160	I mean, I remember back in the day, you were kind of a nerd. If you had the old school
9328160	9330760	Game Boy brick or whatever, very few people had those.
9330760	9332400	I know. The Dark Matrix one.
9332400	9336720	I was, we were sitting in a plane coming back from Penny Arcade Expo, and I looked across
9336720	9340760	the aisle, and there was an old lady with gray hair playing her DS. And I think that
9340760	9346040	shows you just what a long way gaming has come in, you know, handheld gaming in so many
9346040	9347040	years.
9347040	9350560	But it's fine, though, when you think about it now.
9350560	9354980	You know, and really a more appropriate pun would be a DSi touch is really what this thing
9354980	9358760	is kind of to me, because it's going to have like little calendars and all sorts of things.
9358760	9362040	And you know what? It might be kind of cool. Like I said, I'm going to get one, but it's
9362040	9366760	just, I joke because it's kind of like, well, I feel like we've kind of seen this all before.
9366760	9368840	How is Nintendo going to make this special?
9368840	9371320	That's what I really want to know.
9371320	9374960	Should we go through the history list of the Game Boy again, like I did the previous nights?
9374960	9379880	I mean, so many, I mean, so many sad things they did to it and whatnot. You can go all
9379880	9386760	the way back from the Dark Matrix Game Boy to Game Boy Color, Game Boy Mike, Game Boy
9386760	9392680	I got to jump in here with a really good comment and chat from Seg. I don't think Nintendo
9392680	9397560	has the pull enough to play with the telecom industry enough to make a DS phone thing.
9397560	9400760	You know what? That's a darn good point. But here's something else to consider. Nintendo's
9400760	9406320	already kind of got their foot in the water with the whole VOIP thing, right? Like they
9406320	9409080	were showing off the headset and I think they, you know, they do have the headset. They're
9409080	9413760	not quite as on board as the PSP is with Skype and everything. But what do you want to bet?
9413760	9419880	Nintendo could Nintendofy the entire way we think about VOIP. And when I say that, I mean
9419880	9424080	make it disgustingly simple so that even grandma can use it. That's how they're going to get
9424080	9425880	into the phone industry.
9425880	9432620	Well think about this, though. In the homebrew community, somebody actually already did that
9432620	9435120	a while back. But right now it's kind of like-
9435120	9437440	Yeah, the grandma on the airplane doesn't know that.
9437440	9442000	Yeah. Not many people don't know that. There's one that somebody already made like a little
9442000	9447000	VOIP, like a little VOIP thing in the homebrew community already. It's just that not many
9447000	9450000	people don't, again, not many people don't know about it nor have the equipment to do
9450000	9455880	so with it. Because I even have it on my DS for a while, but I was like, who in the world
9455880	9458880	I know going to find, who in the world I know actually have this?
9458880	9462000	I got to say, I'm sorry. I just, while you're talking, the chat room is saying a lot of
9462000	9466800	great stuff. I mean, you are too, but act deaf says WeSpeak may be the test for that.
9466800	9471200	That's a darn good thought. What if your DS could interface with WeSpeak? That might be
9471200	9472200	kind of neat.
9472200	9474200	That, yeah, that would be a killer thought.
9474200	9477200	That would be kind of neat, but that will never happen.
9477200	9482800	As hard of a time as we give Nintendo, they might actually be sitting on genius. It's
9482800	9488720	just a matter of will they do it? Okay. It's like, seriously, they're like the retard in
9488720	9494000	a room with a big button that says, push button for million dollars. And they're like, duh.
9494000	9496360	I don't know what to do.
9496360	9500080	They might be sitting, no, no, here's a better example. Come on. A better example would be
9500080	9504800	that they are sitting on a freaking golden egg. And the question is, are they going to
9504800	9508600	get smart and market this golden egg or are they going to fuck up and make an omelet out
9508600	9510400	of it? That's the question.
9510400	9515080	Only time will tell. Only time will tell. I mean, it's Nintendo. Sometimes Nintendo
9515080	9520000	knows how to basically like, they want to milk everything for what it's worth. Why not?
9520000	9526240	All right. But you, you Dark Knight specifically, are you going to get the DSI?
9526240	9530080	I'm probably going to pass on it because I'm basically going to be like, I'll wait for
9530080	9534960	it when a graphical change hits the DS. I'm not going to, I mean, innovation alone is
9534960	9538360	not really going to wow me this much. I'm still happy with my DS fat.
9538360	9542800	Yeah, exactly. I mean, why did we even really need to upgrade to the light in the first
9542800	9546840	place? Although I did, so it's hard for me to talk.
9546840	9551560	I told him, I said, I was telling some people tonight, I said, if the DS were to have a
9551560	9557080	slight graphical upgrade, I may jump on it. But right now the DS, I just basically like
9557080	9561120	niche stuff and whatnot. I don't need all that niche stuff right now. I really don't.
9561120	9563320	It's not, not really worth it.
9563320	9566360	All right. Well, any other thoughts tonight, Dark Knight, before we let you go? We want
9566360	9569360	to try to get one more thing.
9569360	9573440	I had so many thoughts, but I left my brain, but I'll be discussing it next week when I
9573440	9574440	do my thing.
9574440	9578360	All right. It's all good, Dark Knight. You have a good night. Okay. And thanks for calling.
9578360	9580360	Yeah, you do the same. Take care guys.
9580360	9585080	Let's go talk to Nintendo with us. Have a good one. All right. We'll take one more call.
9585080	9591760	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9591760	9595440	And you can talk about Nintendo or you can talk about Tokyo Game Show. You can talk about
9595440	9598680	SingStar ABBA. I would love that.
9598680	9600040	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9600040	9603840	Hi, this is Hack Deft.
9603840	9608360	Hey, Hack Deft. Wow. It's almost like it's your show tonight. You won the code earlier
9608360	9611920	and we've been reading your chat comments and now here you are. That's all right, though.
9611920	9619640	We enjoy hearing from our friends, especially those abroad. What's on your mind tonight?
9619640	9625800	Well, basically about the ACDC track pack Walmart's going to sell.
9625800	9626800	Yes.
9626800	9635120	I'm thinking that maybe Harmonix and EA, in this case, are taking the steps of Activision
9635120	9642440	and what they're doing with Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero Aerosmith and next year Guitar Hero Metallica.
9642440	9649280	Maybe they're going the same steps, though I'm thinking that they are doing the wrong
9649280	9650280	thing with it.
9650280	9659600	I think they should have maybe released the disc itself but also made it download content
9659600	9669240	and maybe offer it for a cheaper price because $3 for 20 or so songs, for me, I think it's
9669240	9673320	expensive even though it's a new game.
9673320	9680960	Here's the weird thing. I kind of have a feeling this is the part just before the dam breaks.
9680960	9686080	This is the first little drop that leaks out the dam. This is them testing the waters to
9686080	9691600	see if this is going to sell. There's a lot of hardcore ACDC fans out there that are going
9691600	9695400	to be all over this crap.
9695400	9700400	Look at how much I am freaking obsessed over SingStar ABBA. Half of it is in jest but the
9700400	9705280	other half really isn't. I freaking love ABBA. They're the best band out of the 70s. Call
9705280	9710340	me the biggest gay or whatever you want but I will buy this game because it's awesome.
9710340	9715920	There are people like that out there for ACDC. The question is how much are going to put
9715920	9721680	$40 out there to get this game and if this sells even remotely well, the floodgates are
9721680	9726960	going to burst open next year and you are going to see this kind of stuff for 10 bands
9726960	9732840	next year. If they can make that much money off of it, this is where music is going.
9732840	9741760	That's why I'm worrying because if it sells, and I know it will sell because there are
9741760	9753480	a lot of ACDC fans but maybe they could offer the same thing just on the Xbox Live marketplace
9753480	9761060	or on the Playstation Network and make it also downloadable because not everyone is
9761060	9769360	a fan of ACDC but some of them like their songs. Maybe the same thing you could say
9769360	9776280	with ABBA. Like someone said on the chat earlier, you could make the songs downloadable content
9776280	9782000	for SingStar on the Playstation 3 but there aren't.
9782000	9786000	What maybe the artist didn't want it that way. Maybe the artist was one of those types
9786000	9789140	that was like, you know what, if we're going to do this, we want to go all in and maybe
9789140	9792700	that's how they get some of these artists on board because let's face it, these two
9792700	9797520	names we're looking at here, ABBA, ACDC, even things like Aerosmith and Metallica, these
9797520	9800840	are not, as much as I was joking earlier, these are not small time bands. These are
9800840	9807660	big deals. These are company bands with monies and shirts and everything. These are not the
9807660	9812160	people that want their songs going two dollars a pop. They probably want to go all in with
9812160	9815280	this stuff. You know what I mean?
9815280	9820100	They want people to have not just, they don't want their song thrown in as an afterthought
9820100	9824400	in the game. They want an experience built around their band. You know this is how they're
9824400	9829400	selling it to them. When they sit down at the table with ABBA, with ACDC, they're sitting
9829400	9836300	there saying, we want to make this game a whole new way to experience your band and
9836300	9840520	your music and the brand you built. Just feeding the ego.
9840520	9850040	Yeah, that's true. But still, I think they could offer the disc for all the fans because
9850040	9856760	I know there are going to be people that are going to buy it just because it's ACDC. Like
9856760	9862480	I said, and even you, you're going to buy the ABBA disc because it's ABBA. If they make
9862480	9867920	a Death Tones track pack, I know I'm going to buy it because I'm a big Death Tones fan.
9867920	9877080	But still, they could offer the same thing for a cheaper price, at least. I would buy
9877080	9882360	the ACDC pack for $30, at least. You know what, though? I bet for the...
9882360	9889760	I know it's going to be a separate game. It's going to have its own achievements and everything.
9889760	9896960	Think about this. Here's what it is. I bet you this is it. Look at the time of year this
9896960	9904040	game is coming out, too. It's really hard to buy someone download content as a present.
9904040	9908000	But if your grandma, and you're walking in the aisles of Walmart, and you know little
9908000	9913680	Timmy loves ACDC, what do you think you might end up buying him as a present? Because you
9913680	9918320	know he loves ACDC. You know he loves rock band. That's a huge factor in this. Don't
9918320	9923720	discount that. Grandma's less likely to pick up the point cards than she is to pick up
9923720	9930400	ACDC rock band track pack as a present. Something to think about.
9930400	9931400	Yeah, that's true.
9931400	9937000	I don't know. All these are things to consider. They definitely all are. BlackWolf wants to
9937000	9942720	point out also the ACDC pack is cheaper as a track pack than it would if it were separate.
9942720	9949560	It's $30 as a track pack. It's $35 if each song was available for $2 a pop individually.
9949560	9954080	But again, I think they're catering to the impulse buys. That's what they are.
9954080	9963200	Yeah, the 360 and the Playstation 3 version is going to sell for $39.99, so $40 exactly.
9963200	9964200	And if you have a friend who...
9964200	9974680	It's still a little bit expensive. Especially because of people that download songs and
9974680	9979840	maybe a track pack. They have a particular song they like and they would like to play.
9979840	9984560	But still, they would have to buy the $30 disc and just for one song.
9984560	9989920	And here's the thing too. If you have a friend that likes ACDC and doesn't really necessarily
9989920	9995560	have rock band or doesn't really care about dumping the songs onto his hard drive, you
9995560	10000440	could dump them on your own hard drive and then maybe go in half with him for the actual
10000440	10001440	game.
10001440	10003720	I don't think there's enough people that are going to think about that.
10003720	10004720	I don't know.
10004720	10007960	Alright, Act Def, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you
10007960	10012480	so much for your call and hey, I'll be crossing my fingers for the Deftones game for you,
10012480	10013480	okay?
10013480	10014480	Thanks.
10014480	10018200	Alright, take care, buddy. Quick comments from chat though. We're going to wrap up for
10018200	10021120	the Skype line tonight. Sorry if those didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up the
10021120	10024920	show here. Reading some comments from chat, I like this.
10024920	10030280	Retertainment says, Grandma is not likely to pick up a game anyway. For herself, no.
10030280	10036400	But if your grandma does buy ACDC rock band for herself, you do have the coolest fucking
10036400	10037400	grandma in the world.
10037400	10042120	My grandmother drove me all over Mobile trying to find Killer Instinct when it came out.
10042120	10043520	Awesome. That is very awesome.
10043520	10045200	So I do have the coolest grandmother in the world.
10045200	10049640	I don't, but I think grandma might buy it for, I don't, you know, I use grandma loosely,
10049640	10052840	you know what I mean? Like, you know, a friend trying to, or a relative trying to buy it
10052840	10055080	for, you know, but you know what I mean.
10055080	10056240	I still have the coolest grandmother in the world.
10056240	10062760	And nobody said that it wasn't exclusive, you know, permanently for Walmart. I mean,
10062760	10068080	honestly, I have a feeling that maybe it will come out as download content later on.
10068080	10071320	That's true. Wherever they can sell it, they will.
10071320	10076840	Yeah. Grandma is person buying a game for other people, says Seg. That's, that's the
10076840	10078160	point. You got it.
10078160	10082560	All right. That's it. We're going to wrap up. It's another show. We're done. We're out
10082560	10086640	of here. It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night. And we will start
10086640	10089120	off with Loki, your final thought tonight.
10089120	10093480	My final thought is I have a game that I'm going to be playing a lot of, and you'll see
10093480	10095000	some of that very soon.
10095000	10097600	All right. I never asked for any last minute stories. Do you have any?
10097600	10098600	I have a last minute story.
10098600	10102040	Okay. Some quick headlines. I'm sorry. Dark Sakura.
10102040	10106640	For anyone who actually is interested in playing on the International Ragnarok Online server,
10106640	10113540	they have a free server up. It's called Valkyrie. And you've got a couple of, you know, detriments
10113540	10117140	to playing on it, but really it's good if you want to get into the official Ragnarok
10117140	10120160	Online community. And I'll link a page in the chatroom.
10120160	10127160	All right. Very cool. PopCap is releasing Bejeweled Twist in October. I told my wife
10127160	10132560	and she didn't give a shit. Apparently she's ever bejeweled now. I don't know. It's weird.
10132560	10136120	But it's supposed to add some new features to it. No word on what those features are
10136120	10140000	yet, but something that has to do with probably twisting, I'm guessing.
10140000	10146960	The PSP 5.0 firmware has been, is out there in testing phase right now. And it is going
10146960	10153080	to add the WiFi store and also allow you to do screen captures, which are currently available
10153080	10160040	in the not so official homebrew firmwares right now. And no word on when that's going
10160040	10166040	to be coming, but hopefully, probably sometime in October.
10166040	10172440	And then finally, it's rumored that Motley Crue's Dr. Phil Good is going to be coming
10172440	10180760	Rock Band download content on October 14th. And this actually comes from a post on iMeme.com
10180760	10185520	where they are doing a giveaway of Motley Crue's albums. And they also mentioned that
10185520	10190180	Rock Band will be coming as download content on October, or Dr. Phil Good will be coming
10190180	10197720	as download content on Rock Band starting October 24th. So that's kind of interesting.
10197720	10206240	And finally, Taiko no Tatujin in Japan. The Wii version is getting a special wireless
10206240	10216440	drum that you can purchase as well in a bundle that will cost approximately $75 or $7,980.
10216440	10222280	And the drum is also getting purchased separately for $3,990 or approximately $38. And of course
10222280	10230880	the game will be out in Japan on the Wii December 12th. It's kind of neat.
10230880	10235600	So since I kind of derailed your other thought, do you now have a final thought now that we've
10235600	10237640	gotten all the last ministories taken care of?
10237640	10238640	No.
10238640	10242600	Alright. My final thought is, I hear they're opening a Pinkberry in the Bay Area and I
10242600	10255720	want to go. Cause it's good. DarkSocker, your final thought. Alright. Hey, knock it off!
10255720	10261160	Alright. Heart. Hey, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, then please help us spread the word.
10261160	10265320	We're independent radio. We don't get paid for this. We don't have a magazine backing
10265320	10269400	us or a TV station or any of that stuff. So please help spread the word about Orange Lounge
10269400	10272640	Radio because we do this for free. If you like what you've heard, tell two friends about
10272640	10276360	our show and help us spread the word slowly. Or hey, you can leave us a nice review on
10276360	10280320	iTunes. As many people have done lately, we're up to like 85 reviews on there right now and
10280320	10283640	a lot of them are really, really nice and really good and really make us feel good about
10283640	10287560	what we do. And it helps spread the word because the more 5-star reviews we get, the higher
10287560	10291820	we get in the rankings. So please leave us some more nice reviews on iTunes. You guys
10291820	10293680	are awesome for that.
10293680	10297200	And one other quick thing before we head out tonight. One other very, very quick thing
10297200	10303040	before we head out tonight. As I understand it, two of OLR's listeners, Dekeman and Kiki
10303040	10307640	Nico, I don't know if you know, but last year they had a baby. One year ago, they had a
10307640	10314200	baby, Kylie, and Kylie is turning one year old this week. So we want to say happy birthday
10314200	10316000	to Kylie on baby's first birthday.
10316000	10320280	You know what I was going to say, because I don't have any, I'm not going to sing happy
10320280	10323280	birthday because I don't sing, I will give you a little bit of this.
10323280	10332800	Happy birthday to baby Kylie.
10332800	10335320	And also happy birthday to Kylie Minogue whenever her birthday is because she's awesome.
10335320	10336680	Sorry, I had one last story and this was fun.
10336680	10337680	No, the show's over.
10337680	10340080	No, one more. This is kind of cool, okay.
10340080	10341080	All right.
10341080	10345500	Bungie's bringing out a video renderer soon to Halo 3. So they'll actually have an option
10345500	10353040	for those who subscribe to the Bungie Pro where you'll be able to actually export videos
10353040	10359000	made in Halo to a Windows Media format for whatever you may want to use that for.
10359000	10360360	Okay, that is kind of cool.
10360360	10361360	Yeah.
10361360	10364640	But not nearly as awesome as Kylie Minogue.
10364640	10369560	Thank you everybody for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio. We'll see you next time for
10369560	10374480	more wackiness and hopefully joining us in the studio will be Ball Hair the Dwarf. Good
10374480	10375480	night.
