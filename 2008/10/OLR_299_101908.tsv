13868	16073	and I, October 19th, 2008.
16213	18598	LittleBigPlanet generates some big controversy.
18738	22145	Download content comes to Soul Calibur 4 that will surprise no one.
22305	25532	And could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 soon be re-released?
31414	35435	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35475	38276	We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
38736	44118	And over the next three hours we'll be talking about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44178	50280	And with you for the next few hours is myself, Rob Roberts, and the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50820	51120	Hi.
51380	52541	How are you, Miss Jamie Summers?
52941	53641	Annoyed of the world.
54061	54481	Why is that?
54861	55401	People suck.
55802	56562	I'm sorry to hear that.
56582	59723	Alright, I guess we'll have some good rants tonight.
60203	60343	Mmm.
60763	61103	All right.
61363	61523	No.
61763	62324	Careful, chat.
62564	63544	Specific people suck.
63824	64124	Oh, boy.
64364	65525	It wasn't me.
65685	66345	I didn't do it, did I?
66445	66625	No.
66725	67465	You love me, right?
67766	68826	It's groups of people.
69266	69546	Okay.
69806	70106	All right.
70847	71427	Well, we'll see.
71647	74188	Maybe we'll catch on a little bit about what's going on a little later.
74208	75788	If I don't feel better about it by then.
76309	76629	All right.
77009	77349	We'll see.
78269	80590	Also, say hello to the one and only Loki.
81010	81410	Hello.
81631	82391	How are you, Tech Master?
82431	82671	Loki?
82891	83371	I'm fine.
83511	84051	You have a good week?
84512	84712	Yes.
84952	87012	Are you mad at certain groups of people, too?
87032	87072	No.
89213	89693	Maybe.
89894	91375	You're perpetually mad at somebody.
91415	91935	No, I'm just kidding.
117692	119973	on this lovely Sunday evening as we always do when we tape live.
120493	121233	Alright, let's start off.
121633	123114	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
123694	125434	I played Rock Band 2 and Ragnarok Online.
126455	127055	How was Rock Band 2?
127915	128615	It was very good.
128875	130176	Yeah?
131556	133497	What is your instrument of preference in Rock Band 2?
134477	135017	I don't have one.
135557	136858	You like to play a little bit of everything?
137498	138978	I really don't prefer to play.
139538	140259	Oh, you like to watch?
140579	141019	Well, no.
141119	145360	My shoulder hurt and I was in a lot of pain so they made me play based on a song.
145723	146103	Gotcha.
146544	148785	Alright, well, hey.
148825	150506	How did you like it compared to the first one?
151567	152407	It's all no different.
153908	154929	It's more rock band.
155589	156169	Yeah, more.
156430	157730	Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
157750	158291	More songs.
158371	164815	I mean, that was okay, but, you know, I wasn't, it wasn't anything to be impressed or displeased over.
164975	165895	It was just more rock band.
166776	167036	Alright.
167796	169497	Well, if there's nothing else, then we'll move on to Loki.
169517	170238	How was your gaming week?
171519	172599	Oh, the clothes in it suck.
173080	173460	Hahaha.
175593	177154	Better Barbie mode in the first game.
177614	178915	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
179035	183197	Well, they actually still have some of the same clothes from the first game and the second game.
183538	184618	They didn't really add that much.
185299	186519	The gore outfits were kind of neat.
189161	193063	Let's see, this week I played Saints Row 2, actually.
193303	197726	I think I'm about almost 50% done with the game.
198086	200767	It says I'm only like 37% or maybe it's 47% done.
200887	201108	Um...
204403	206303	Basically, I've gone through two of the gangs already.
206363	208924	I've finished the Brotherhood and the Son of Samidi.
211664	213805	That was a weird gang.
213945	215725	Finally, now I'm starting to run in a little bit.
218265	218605	I don't know.
218846	219366	It's pretty cool.
219406	225707	I still think, though, out of the three gangs so far, the Brotherhood have been... I think that storyline was the most brutal that was in it.
226347	228747	I played a little bit of the multiplayer.
228827	231648	They actually have a game mode that's pretty awesome.
231668	232608	It kind of mixes up...
233448	234309	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
264000	265002	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
280182	287187	All along, while this is going on, there's also different tags you can spray paint to give your teams different abilities.
287267	295373	Like double damage or double money for killing other gang members or a smoke screen.
296033	297574	Stuff like that.
298054	300176	Really cool gameplay.
300736	303058	The actual deathmatch mode is pretty fun.
303778	306800	I like the shopping mall level that they have.
306840	308101	That's kind of fun to play around in.
311768	312469	What else did I play?
312489	316451	I have a random off-the-wall question for you about Saints Row 2.
316511	319592	I know we have a news story coming up later on about some of the controversy this game is generating.
320133	328117	Which game do you think is more violent and has more potential for controversy, this game or Grand Theft Auto, seeing as they're very similar and appeal to the same audience?
329156	345784	Um, maybe this game a little bit, because they don't really get into, I mean, there's corrupt police in Grand Theft Auto 4, um, in this game you can actually dress up or impersonate a cop in this, like, fictional cops type show, um, called, uh, I forget what it was called now, um...
348433	350274	Oh, The Fuzz, that's what the show's called.
350794	359238	And you basically go around beating up people dressed up as cops while they're filming it and stuff.
359278	360299	And it's one of the activities.
362160	367543	Plus, there's a level where you break into a police station and do a bunch of stuff like that.
368223	371105	If anything, I'd say Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, I think, was more...
373188	373828	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
394815	396537	Grand Theft Auto 4
417556	418096	I'm not surprised.
418136	426101	If I'm the developers of Saints Row 2 and the people behind this game, I know one of the best ways I'm going to get at and get close to that number is to one-up the controversy they're doing.
426121	428982	Because that's half the reason why Grand Theft Auto sells.
429702	432404	People need to understand it's fiction.
432524	437526	It's not like I go and go shoot the cops in the game because I wish I could go shoot real cops.
437586	439427	I mean, that's not what happens.
439487	440608	It's just the opposition.
440668	444370	It could be Nazis running this entire city and it doesn't matter.
444770	445551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
471525	472368	It was Fable 2.
473091	476322	I thought it was an actual movie coming out, and it was a Fable 2 commercial.
476824	476984	Yeah.
478074	481275	I mean, games are getting... They've come a long way since combat.
481475	482155	Let's put it that way.
482735	488576	But, yeah, I mean, it's just if... Yeah, if you want to look at it like it's realistic or something like that, then yeah, okay, sure.
489176	494658	I guess it's offensive to cops or something, but you have to understand games aren't meant to be a simulation for real life.
494738	505580	I mean, granted, you can make a game that's like a simulation of real life if you want, but then again, you can also make pure fiction that's just way over the top, which is what Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto are doing, you know,
506300	507081	To an extent.
507681	511264	And Grand Theft Auto is a little bit more grounded, but still, it's pretty over the top.
512645	512985	I don't know.
513225	517028	It's just... You can find controversy anywhere.
520290	527095	And then the other game I've played, which also has controversy involved with it, would be LittleBigPlanet.
527656	529617	And LittleBigPlanet is amazing.
530178	532459	That's easy to say.
532499	534421	I mean, it's just an amazing game.
535595	536316	Thanks for watching!
551738	553238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
575281	579585	They're characters of different sections of the world.
579945	585090	So the African level is all like, think Lion King, basically.
586831	592076	Whereas the British levels are all knights in castles and that kind of thing.
593196	600182	So it's a little bit racist, but in the way that it's a small world is racist, where no one's going to possibly be offended because it's so damn cute.
600663	601383	It's incredibly cute.
601403	601603	Right?
602384	603345	Game of the Year?
603365	603705	Game of the Year?
632213	634174	It could definitely be a contender for Game of the Year.
635635	636856	Anything else in your gaming week this week?
638017	640199	Um... No.
640879	648584	I hate to take it back to Saints Row because you talk about that game an awful lot, but a good question from chatroom at chat.orangeonlinesradio.com First chat comment of the night goes to Seymour Booty.
649365	653808	Since you guys are talking about Saints Row 2, are you having any problems with crashing or freezing in the game?
653848	656109	It crashes my system every time I try to save manually.
657230	658391	Um... Not really.
658451	660112	I've had it lock up a few times.
660752	660853	Um...
661789	662550	But it's just random.
662690	663850	I mean, it's just like any other game.
664651	673537	I haven't really had any problems saving manually because I do it all the time just in case I want to quit or something at that time.
675699	677380	No, not really any problems with it.
678641	679382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
694542	695562	Starfall PvP Typhoon
713548	714129	Thank you for watching!
732579	736500	We went back to Ubers and the old WoW content and got ourselves the Jenkins title.
736940	742662	Because you can now, you know, WoW has this funny way of working in pop culture references about WoW into WoW.
743182	749324	And this whole Leroy Jenkins thing is now Leroy is an achievement and if you get that achievement you can have Jenkins as your title.
749544	754505	So that you're like, you know, if your character name is, you know, Sky, you would be Sky Jenkins.
755145	755806	Which is kind of funny.
756746	757206	So there you go.
758400	768145	Other than Warcraft and experiencing the new patch, I actually took a trip, and you folks that have been listening to the show for a long time since we were about music games will appreciate this, and you guys here in studio.
768605	770326	I went to Milpitas Golf Land this week.
770686	771927	I went to good old Miggle.
773508	776869	It's changed a lot since, you know, I hadn't been there in quite a few years.
777049	780691	Last time I was there, I think they still had Derby Owners Club, which is now at our Vigil.
781511	786034	And at Milpitas Golf Land, you know, you have to remember, this is like the holy land of...
787174	795318	of Beatmania and the Babani in, you know, between Milpitas and Sunnyvale Golf Land, you know, these were, I guess you could say Arcade Infinity to an extent, too.
795819	797800	It was like the trinity of California.
797820	798760	Northern California.
799180	802782	Well, Arcade Infinity is southern, technically, but you know what I mean, though.
802822	806684	It's like one of the west coast hubs of where DDR got big.
807084	809966	And it's interesting to see, you know how Milpitas...
811229	837056	used to have DDR in one of the rooms that room it's it's like two rooms you have to this arcade is like two separate buildings one building now is nothing but ticket games like I remember when we were first going there like half of it was ticket redemption it was slowly spreading well now it is nothing but ticket redemption in one room but it's interesting because they've turned the other room into you know like all the music games are on one one wall then all the driving games are over here and all the fighting games are over here so it's kind of like you have
837496	839997	Just different little sections that was kind of interesting.
840037	846258	But I did play... I played Midnight Maximum Tune 3 and I played Keyboard Mania even though it was sticking on the keyboard.
846298	849459	But a new game I played, Dance Dance Revolution Supernova 2.
850179	855320	It's been out this whole time and I have not yet played it in arcades and it was really the same damn thing as the last game.
855340	856320	There wasn't much difference.
856680	857560	Just some new songs.
857960	858361	Yippee!
858621	860561	And some little flashy graphics when you get combos.
860581	860761	That's it.
860781	861621	I forgot to let you know.
862441	864462	I mean, this is totally local news, but...
865442	871866	Remember that one store that we went to that's right there by the Folsom Theater, the Gamer's Empire or whatever?
871886	873688	They got a Supernova machine now.
874268	877550	It's untouched, basically.
878451	879652	Well, this is the other thing that surprised me.
879792	881873	Miggle is selling their DDR Extreme machine.
882193	883794	They have a little sign on it that says for sale.
883894	888497	Guess how much they want for this Miggle DDR Extreme machine as is.
889178	888497	$12,000.
889418	890879	No, a little high.
891219	891920	Very high, in fact.
892800	891920	$8,000.
892880	894301	It's a used machine.
894441	895102	No, much higher.
896483	896743	8,000 dollars.
897163	897684	A little lower.
898884	899105	7,000 dollars.
899145	899805	A little lower than that.
899825	901546	6,000 dollars.
901566	902807	6,000 dollars is what they want for this machine.
903227	904228	It's not bad.
904248	904768	5,999 to be exact.
905269	905509	I don't know.
905529	908471	You can take the machine, retrofit it, and upgrade it, I mean.
908491	910492	That's always interesting.
910852	911193	I don't know.
911333	911913	So, that was it.
911973	916596	And then I actually played miniature golf, which in all the times I've ever been to Milpitas Golf Line, I never have played miniature golf there.
916676	917377	But I did this time.
918357	918858	So there you go.
920754	946936	Miniature Golf the real game um that's it not a lot of whole other console games i've been playing just you know experiencing wow this week and you know some of the same old console stuff i've been playing like rock band and all that good stuff all right let's get into uh some housekeeping real quick it is episode number 299 tonight which means next week is episode number 300 if you can believe it and uh what we want you guys to do is we want you to leave your messages for us we're going to play them during next week's commercial break um
947436	950659	If you want to say a few words about Orange Launch Radio, just try to keep it a minute or less.
951139	953441	You can call the Skype line anytime when we're not live.
953521	966832	Don't call right now if you're listening live on Sunday night, but if you're listening to this in the podcast format, give 1-877-GAME-OLR a call and leave us a message about what you think about us making Episode 300, and we'll play it on the break next week.
966872	968774	Otherwise, it's going to be a good old-fashioned show.
969114	970715	You never know what kind of guests might show up.
970835	972657	Also, we have some games planned for next week.
972717	973337	It'll be a good time.
973818	974218	There you have it.
976332	979573	and something that... Loki has a huge surprise, we'll say that.
979793	980373	We'll say that much.
980433	981373	Loki has a huge surprise.
983314	985774	And let's see, what else do we have coming up?
986614	989755	If you've been listening to the show this year, you know I've had some medical issues going on.
990095	994956	I'm going to be having surgery right after episode 300, so we probably won't be having a show the next week.
995316	997256	So we might have a little bit of a break after episode 300.
997296	998897	We'll have more details on that next week.
999117	999497	That's all.
999957	1000697	So we'll talk about that.
1001497	1003499	And don't worry, the surgery is nothing major.
1003539	1004761	It's gallbladder surgery.
1004841	1005902	A million people have had it done.
1005942	1006963	I'm not that worried about it.
1007003	1008444	I just kind of want to get it over with at this point.
1009185	1010947	So, that's it for housekeeping.
1011227	1011968	Visit our MySpace.
1012208	1012949	Visit our Facebook.
1013609	1014871	Visit our LiveJournal, our Twitter.
1015832	1017113	Let's get into tonight's gaming news.
1017173	1017934	Loki, start us off.
1018464	1024307	Yes, anyways, so this is kind of interesting.
1024487	1028809	I mean, not too surprising because they haven't been doing well financially for a while now.
1029329	1034551	But Infogrames has finally now finished purchasing Atari.
1035272	1039074	They made an $11 million stock purchase.
1040310	1043832	of Atari, and previously they had owned 51.4%.
1047014	1052957	But now they are done with the purchase, and we'll see where they take it.
1053677	1059460	Hopefully in the right direction, and not, I don't know, into the red again.
1061641	1066004	This is the same company that brought us the Epic 2600 in My How Times Have Changed, right?
1066504	1067925	This is kind of, I don't know, kind of
1068922	1078004	Kind of sad in a way, but you kind of saw it coming because what has Atari done in the past five years that's been really huge, besides maybe their flashback consoles, which are really cool, actually.
1079945	1081185	Dragon Ball Z?
1082145	1084025	I guess, all right, but I don't know.
1084406	1085706	In a way, it's kind of the end of an era.
1086226	1086426	Era?
1086446	1087386	Did I say error?
1087926	1088647	No, I'm thinking of something else.
1088927	1090247	No, the end of an era, you know what I mean?
1092127	1094448	So, that's kind of sad, but there you go.
1095447	1099088	Hey, LittleBigPlanet has been stirring up a lot of talk this week.
1099308	1105010	And one thing that's got people talking about LittleBigPlanet is the new license agreement that Sony has.
1105831	1108952	Sony actually recently changed the PlayStation Network terms of use.
1109392	1123297	And basically, to make a long story short, Sony says now in the user license agreement, you also authorize us and our affiliated companies without payment to you to license, sell, and otherwise commercially exploit your user material.
1124246	1125547	So if you don't like it, don't use it.
1125747	1140112	If you create a little big planet level in the game and Sony decides they're going to sell it on a compilation later on, like maybe a best of for people that don't have online access, as I could possibly see forthcoming, depending on how big this game is, too bad, you're not getting any money for it.
1140512	1141813	And if you don't like it, don't play the game.
1142873	1145354	You know, I like how they actually have exploit in there.
1146934	1147975	It's an interesting word.
1148135	1149535	And we'll rape your mother.
1150576	1150796	What?
1150816	1151616	I don't know.
1151656	1153357	I don't think that'll be a little big planet level.
1154506	1156287	It could be.
1156947	1158327	It's kind of not surprising.
1158367	1165529	I know a lot of people are looking at this and say, oh my gosh, Sony is so big, bad, and evil corporate, but is it really that surprising in a way?
1166070	1166350	No.
1166550	1166970	Not really.
1167010	1172131	I would hope that they still give you credit for it at least or say, hey, it's going to be in here.
1172371	1174332	At least they have a free copy of the game.
1174372	1174632	Shit.
1175032	1176333	That's the least they could do.
1176353	1179414	I mean, a lot of people would probably be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put it in there.
1179574	1180754	I mean, I don't think they would.
1181601	1185082	I don't know, I would be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put that in there, just give me credit.
1186182	1188123	But if you don't like it, you don't like it, don't use it.
1189243	1191144	Don't play the game, I guess.
1191304	1198306	I mean, I don't know, if you were really expecting to profit off LittleBigPlanet, I think you might be playing the game for the wrong reasons, right?
1199146	1199326	Yeah.
1199646	1199946	I don't know.
1201566	1207308	Anyhow, we'll see how Sony plans to exploit user-created levels pretty soon.
1208345	1214449	Well, moving on to... I don't know if this... Well, exploitation just really isn't the best word for this.
1214489	1219152	I call it hypocrisy, but, you know, as we discussed with Bobby earlier, speaking of which...
1222168	1239879	This is LittleBigPlanet is being recalled because of religious content within the game and technically what it is is two expressions from the Koran have made it into the game by means of a song that was licensed to be in the game.
1240439	1242562	that came out a few years ago.
1244504	1258660	And one person in the beta found it and apparently took offense to its presence and therefore wrote a letter to Sony, which I have right here, because I love pulling up, you know...
1261163	1265108	and archived content off of message boards after posts have been deleted for days.
1268072	1272857	And I'm not even going to bother pronouncing any of the Arabic because I can't.
1273598	1274760	We'll play the clip in a little bit.
1276038	1278000	Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule
1291434	1298156	When I listened carefully, I was surprised to hear some very familiar Arabic words from the Quran.
1298877	1300837	You can listen to the track here, we'll play it in a second.
1301357	1311401	The words are, in the 18th second, it's to translate, "...every soul shall have the taste of death," and to, almost immediately after, in the 27th second, "...all that is on earth will perish."
1312341	1312621	Too late!
1329010	1334415	We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our Holy Quran deeply offending.
1335055	1342321	We hope you would remove the track from the game immediately via an online patch and make sure that all future shipments of the game do not contain it.
1342862	1346685	We'd also like to mention this isn't the first time something like this has happened in video games.
1347585	1356933	Nintendo's 1998 hit Zelda Ocarina of Time contained a musical track with Islamic phrases and was removed in later shipments of the game after Nintendo was contacted by Muslim organizations.
1357454	1368062	Last year Capcom's Zack and Wiki and Activision's Call of Duty 4 also contained objectionable material offensive to Muslims that was spotted before the release of the final games and both companies thankfully removed the content.
1368803	1375629	We hope that you act immediately to avoid any confusion and necessary controversy and we thank you for making such an amazing game.
1376349	1378530	Now, I think the letter was very well worded.
1378950	1384111	However, I'm going to go back and read a particular line from this, if I may.
1385571	1389512	We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our Holy Quran deeply offending.
1389832	1393813	So why aren't you offended at the artist that, you know, recorded the song in the first place?
1395254	1399114	Don't you think that's just a little bit of hypocrisy right there?
1399715	1405696	I mean, shouldn't you actually take issue up with the songwriter, who, by the way, is Muslim, right?
1406638	1408879	Yeah, and the song has been out since 2006.
1409980	1413482	Exactly, so why don't you do your homework first?
1414622	1418264	Okay, and to be honest, I mean, who is this really offending?
1418304	1421806	It's not like, you know, death to America, woohoo!
1422146	1424167	It's not, there's nothing like that.
1424267	1428069	I mean, most people are not going to know what it means.
1428589	1431251	They're just going to hear it and they're going to say, hey, that sounds African.
1431331	1433552	Hey, that fits with the level in the game.
1434343	1436124	Because that's what I heard, and that's what I thought.
1436164	1438065	I'm like, hell, this song is fucking awesome.
1438725	1445828	So to put this in context of the game of why this music would be here in the first place, like, you know, in the Africa level, you hear African-style music.
1445848	1448230	In the South America level, you hear South American-style music.
1448270	1452111	So in the, you know, in a level that's appropriate, you hear this music.
1452191	1454613	It's world music, basically, as you're traveling different parts of the world.
1455153	1461876	But somehow this slipped under the radar where, you know, people didn't realize that this could be offensive, even though the song's been out there for a while when nothing's said.
1462116	1465819	Well, keep in mind also, this is what I drew a parallel to.
1466439	1471443	Why aren't Christian groups being offended at Rock Band 2 for having System of a Down in it?
1471503	1472184	They probably are.
1472584	1473325	Lines from the Bible.
1473605	1474446	They probably are.
1474646	1476487	Why did the game come out then with that song in it?
1476828	1484153	Probably because Christian groups don't care because they have their own music with lines from the Bible and it's Christian rock and they're just like, hell yeah, spread the word.
1484514	1487096	But it's the same equivalent is what I'm saying.
1487136	1488517	But I'm just sorry, I mean...
1491182	1497627	If I get pissed off, okay, if something I find offensive in a game and I write Sony a letter, they're going to be like, fuck off.
1498608	1502511	If I say I'm Arab, then they're like, oh, oh, now we're going to listen to you.
1502872	1503692	Double fucking standard.
1503712	1504093	I disagree.
1504353	1504753	I disagree.
1504793	1505634	I completely disagree.
1505654	1520466	This is actually something that's going on in the country, especially over here, is that we're seeing people catering to different ethnic groups because of this whole perception of oppression that really should not exist in America in the modern world.
1520866	1549398	I am going to put together a letter then to Sony and Media Monocle and I'm going to tell them how deeply offended I am that they are censoring the game I don't understand why if we offend one person I don't get why it's a big deal I actually do wonder how Sony would have reacted if the letter came that had absolutely no reference to the person sending it being Muslim or if they specifically said I am not Muslim, however
1550791	1552277	Their reaction would have been different.
1552318	1553683	There is a freaking double standard.
1553864	1554306	I'm sorry.
1555793	1559495	Just to give some context to this, I'm going to play the clip from this game.
1560096	1561356	It's hit the gaming blog.
1561397	1562857	Somebody recorded it off their phone.
1562877	1564078	I'm going to give credit where credit is due.
1564118	1569861	We pulled this from Kotaku, where I believe one of their users got the sound clip and posted it on the site there.
1571382	1572003	I'm going to play it.
1572223	1577186	If you think for whatever reason this might offend you, I urge you to not listen to the next minute of the program.
1577226	1583469	But I just want to give this some context so that our listeners can understand where the controversy might be springing from.
1584030	1584690	I'm going to play the clip.
1596522	1600485	So it definitely sets a certain type of world mood, right, this music?
1600505	1600665	Yeah.
1618482	1622587	And there's an awful lot of ignorant Americans out there that are not going to know anything that was just said.
1623087	1624048	Not going to know any of that.
1624489	1627792	They're just going to think, oh, it matches the movie.
1628873	1632597	I know three words in Arabic and I couldn't say them off the top of my head.
1633518	1634299	So how was that?
1635681	1650595	Look, I want to present a different opinion here, because I think, although I do see the overreaction going on here a little bit, and I think you're right, there are other religious things that are offensive that are in video games, I think in a way, Sony's doing us all a favor by pulling this game.
1651075	1652356	Is it a little bit hypersensitive?
1652436	1652657	Yes.
1652777	1654298	But is it Sony's fault?
1654779	1654979	No.
1655259	1656000	Whose fault is it?
1656200	1656921	The media's fault.
1657301	1657661	Because...
1658582	1676168	Unfortunately, if this had gone out and the wrong person had heard about it, and instead CNN, Al Jazeera, MSNBC gets a letter about this, then it's suddenly going to be all over the mainstream press that, oh my gosh, video games are teaching children passages from the Quran.
1676328	1676848	And it's over.
1677168	1678088	You know what I mean at that point?
1678408	1685111	It's just another outrage of the violence in games and the messages that games are teaching us.
1685291	1686391	Now it's religious text.
1686731	1689614	Who's going to say that it's not going to happen anyways?
1691256	1697943	How about the people representing Mexico saying that they don't like the way that Mexicans are portrayed in this game?
1698023	1700245	Or how about the way that South America is portrayed in this game?
1701447	1705491	I see Sony sees smoke and they're trying to put out the fire before it spreads.
1705991	1714295	I kind of, and forgive me for going to a comedian on this one, but I kind of want to quote Carlos Mencia about talking about people being offended about the Taco Bell dog.
1716456	1722880	He's like, the Taco Bell dog sends out messages for people that Mexicans are stupid.
1722900	1725101	He's like, no, it's sending out messages to buy more tacos.
1726241	1729283	You know, it's people looking to be offended at something.
1729323	1733285	It's people that are trying to find an excuse to...
1734993	1744698	I really do think it's people just trying to find some sort of excuse to put a little drama into their lives, to break up the monotony, instead of trying to just say, hey, it's in there.
1745518	1746198	I don't care.
1749820	1753742	If you're going to be offended at it being in the game, be offended at the person that recorded the song to begin with.
1754719	1756200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1774514	1796762	I don't think the mainstream media would have given a fuck I think they would have placed blame on the game and I think Sony is just trying to put out that fire it's sad but that's the world we live in it sucks but I agree with you that Sony is trying but I also do think that it would not have gotten as much attention from Sony had it not specifically said I and other Muslims are offended by this
1799048	1808337	Because we do have that double standard that if you are some sort of oppressed group, and I say oppressed in quotes, that you automatically have to have someone throw you a bone.
1808498	1809579	I'm sorry, that's not how it works.
1809599	1813663	So was this dude like the only Muslim person playing this game, you know, in the beta or something?
1813683	1815344	It was one person in the beta.
1815384	1819929	He posted about it and found other people in his religious group that were equally offended.
1820069	1820910	were they playing the game?
1820930	1824012	I have a hard time believing he was the one and only Muslim in the beta.
1824032	1824793	That's what I just said.
1825514	1828737	He was talking to other people in other forums like you said in his letter.
1829317	1831979	To his credit, his letter was well worded and very respectful.
1832540	1834201	That I do have to commend him on.
1834221	1840346	And he wasn't asking for the game to be recalled and I don't think we're placing any of the blame on this guy at all for maybe bringing it to light.
1840367	1841147	He even specifically said
1842248	1844189	Future releases not contain it.
1844229	1847190	Patch the first releases, future printings, don't include it.
1847990	1858133	That's acceptable, and that's part of what the beta is there for, to weed out offensive material, to weed out bugs, to make sure that you're releasing clean, safe content.
1858413	1858733	and so on.
1875954	1883439	But I am going to, you know, like I said before, I don't know that Sony, I think he was right.
1883900	1887022	The guy who sent the letter was right to voice his concern.
1887082	1890244	If he felt like it was a big enough concern, he was right to voice it.
1890264	1895768	Because what was one thing that I always say, nothing changes until you put forth the effort to make it change.
1895788	1896268	Am I correct?
1896568	1898810	I think, though, that the recall should be voluntary.
1898930	1905776	Because if you are offended by it, then yes, they should give you the opportunity to send in your copy of the game so they don't have to hear that.
1906116	1914504	But if a person like me, who thinks the song is pretty kick-ass and doesn't really care what it says, wants to keep it, then I don't see what the big deal is.
1914904	1928119	And see, that's part of what I... Because now they're oppressing me and my desire to have this song in the game for my own personal use, and they're oppressing me to benefit somebody else.
1928219	1929180	That is my problem.
1929260	1930221	I don't have a problem with...
1931022	1931682	Thanks for watching!
1949457	1950818	There's... It's pointless.
1950958	1952320	You're wasting time and money.
1952400	1954161	You could just put out a patch.
1954702	1965872	Why should one... Because one group of people is offended by content that does not offend... Now, especially when the content is not attacking another group.
1965912	1971597	Now, if this was content that was saying, we hate all of so-and-such group, kill them all...
1972478	1974439	Then, yes, it should be removed, don't you think?
1975239	1984242	But if it's just something, not even a specific statement, just saying, oh, well, one day the earth is gone and all this stuff is going to happen.
1984262	1985842	Well, it's just like reading Revelations, really.
1986542	1995525	I mean, it's nothing that's directed towards a party that anyone who is not in that faith would really get the reference to.
1997618	1999219	I just don't think there's an easy answer to this.
1999319	2001801	I think this whole story is just a reflection of the world we live in.
2002282	2003863	People are just too fucking offended.
2004223	2004464	I know.
2004964	2012550	But you know, I'm sitting here thinking, it's live radio, and sometimes I'm giving a lot of these stories a lot of thought as we're sitting here talking about them.
2012571	2019577	And I'm thinking, there's a story coming up later in the show in Part B where we're going to talk about something that's coming out in an upcoming game that kind of offends me a little bit.
2020937	2033762	and although I can take offense I know how to be offended or whatever it's just kind of one of those things where even I look at some of the things that happen in video games and I go this is so stupid I wish games would kind of learn how to
2034761	2037323	I don't know, address some of these things more appropriately.
2037383	2044948	In a way, I feel like a hypocrite kind of sitting here going, you know, well, everybody should just kind of learn to deal with it when I'm thinking about it.
2045208	2048210	But come to think of it, there are some things in video games that offend me.
2049151	2054314	Do you think that you would get equal representation if you had emailed that company that makes that game?
2054534	2055455	Hell to the no.
2055655	2056176	Exactly.
2056736	2058317	Exactly my damn point.
2058978	2061759	What about Redneck Rampage, okay?
2062160	2063360	Now, while I personally...
2064461	2066183	Don't consider myself to be a redneck.
2066223	2075854	I do consider quite a number of my relatives to be purely... Jeff Foxworthy defines redneck as someone completely lacking in sophistication.
2076515	2076996	I agree.
2077416	2078537	That's most of my family.
2079158	2106698	Not my immediate, but aunts and uncles and cousins Anyway, so if I said I'm from Mobile, Alabama and I'm offended at this game or I'm offended at how you've portrayed this southern person in this game as being stupid just because they talk a little slower and have a thick accent that doesn't mean that their IQ is any lower than anybody else's I could say I'm offended at that or I could just laugh and go I'm related to people like that
2107758	2108779	Thanks for watching!
2122850	2123190	I don't know.
2123250	2124830	I don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open.
2124870	2125430	Well, what the hell?
2125610	2126031	We're here.
2126091	2127671	We do this show for a reason to talk about things.
2127731	2133272	But the story I want to talk about later has to do with an upcoming game that just reinforces gay stereotypes I wish would go away.
2133812	2138653	And as a gay man, it gets really old after a while seeing some of these gay stereotypes in games.
2139033	2144394	So I just kind of sit here and go, God, I wish it would just fucking grow up some of these people that program the games.
2144854	2151455	So I'm thinking to myself, but at the same time, maybe there's people that are Arab that are sick of some of these stereotypes that are in the game about the...
2152995	2154796	The verses that are being said, I don't know.
2155076	2157236	In a way, I just don't want to be a hypocrite here.
2157516	2158236	But see, that's the thing.
2158857	2161657	There's quite a bit of difference between what you're discussing and what's going on.
2161957	2168019	This is just... Well, at the same time, CNN would never run a story either on the fact that this other game comes out and offends gay people.
2168079	2168779	That would never happen.
2168899	2169319	Never happen.
2169499	2171740	Because it's stereotypes that a lot of people think about.
2172020	2179743	It was going back to the massive double standard about what's considered bigotry and what's not, really.
2179803	2183445	It's like I was just saying in the chat room, racism is racism.
2183545	2184165	It doesn't matter.
2184765	2187046	I brought up an example.
2187226	2188587	We did a diversity class at my work.
2188807	2190648	Any corporation does diversity classes.
2191168	2196250	And I brought a situation, and I think I've said it on the show, when I worked in Alabama at Aladdin's Castle,
2196950	2198411	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2219986	2248111	there's a street fighter machine right there and she shut up and walked away but you see what I mean racism is racism, bigotry is bigotry and as long as we perpetuate that type of thought and as long as we keep getting offended instead of just learning to roll a little bit with the punches give a little, take a little then what's going to happen we're breeding a different kind of intolerance don't you think?
2248578	2249478	That's a reasonable answer.
2272885	2279833	The question we asked our folks on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, did Sony overreact by recalling LittleBigPlanet due to the controversial music in the game?
2279893	2280574	Why or why not?
2280614	2286841	And here's some of the responses that we got on our Twitter, starting off with DarkTetsuya.
2292608	2293369	And I don't know about lawsuit...
2309665	2314446	I'm not trying to prove all our listeners wrong, I'm sorry, but I just want to say, hey, look at this too.
2315186	2319287	Geekboy2424 says, yes, nobody would have noticed if they wouldn't have mentioned it.
2319347	2321528	The person who heard this had to have scanned it.
2322168	2323288	Well, he was a beta tester, right?
2323668	2331590	Well, okay, not to mention that he's also probably very familiar with the Koran as well, because I don't know about you, but if someone quotes Bible verses to me...
2332310	2332651	Wish!
2332691	2332771	Wish!
2332791	2332871	Wish!
2348680	2349901	Let me read some of these other responses.
2350201	2356523	Mar and Marvel says, I think that it was overreacting a bit, but I can understand because of not wanting to offend people, especially in this so happy day and age.
2357324	2360245	Dustoise says, wait, we have to please everyone and offend no one.
2360525	2361886	We better stop the world now then.
2362026	2362906	Big overreaction.
2363626	2364907	Pete Garuno says, hell no.
2365147	2366007	Oh, fine, enough of that.
2366047	2368268	To be honest, political correctness is going overboard.
2368308	2370429	It seems silly that nobody cared until launch.
2371289	2376672	Gold Anthro says, yes, with the game being awaited for so long, just to remove it for something so small seems unnecessary.
2377352	2380956	DJ Tyrant says, no, it was something that needed to be removed and caught earlier.
2381336	2383278	Not everyone is connected to the interwebs either.
2384319	2388683	The Sag says, considering worldwide reactions to cartoons, absolutely not.
2389003	2390725	Recalls are less expensive than riots.
2391085	2391866	Interesting point.
2392346	2392807	Interesting point.
2393327	2397409	Decipher13 says, With people suing for less these days, Sony didn't overreact.
2397529	2400631	Receiving the game at work and it being recalled in the same day was odd.
2400651	2401832	So there you have it.
2401852	2405554	Some of our comments from the Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR.
2405594	2408075	And I'm sure this will go on for quite some time.
2408295	2410316	I'm curious to see what kind of emails we get this week.
2412884	2413264	I don't know.
2414205	2417827	Again, I think this is a type of quandary to where there's no easy answer.
2417987	2425752	There's no easy solution because unfortunately there are people that will get offended and it could affect gaming's perception out there as a whole.
2425893	2426673	And it's just a shame.
2427554	2427914	It's a shame.
2430006	2443792	It's just, I really... My last two cents on it, really, is just I'm not looking forward to a world where no one can have any sort of free thought or opinion of their own without someone else trying to strike them down for being wrong.
2444913	2446974	My final thing is, I don't have a problem...
2449827	2450167	Perfect!
2450207	2450767	Perfect solution!
2480509	2482992	PS3 and PSP have received brand new firmware updates.
2500530	2507434	The PS3 at a whopping 2.50 and PSP at now 5.0 firmwares.
2508215	2510236	Some of the brand new features included with that.
2510496	2516960	The PSP version is getting the PlayStation Online store now, which is pretty awesome.
2518732	2522073	Also the PS3 version, Flash 9 support.
2550519	2561024	and also I guess they're including support now for the official PS3 Bluetooth adapter because they're now releasing a new headset that's going to be with SOCOM and stuff.
2561984	2565726	You can set your system to automatically shut down after downloading stuff.
2566867	2569928	I'm trying to remember what else was added with the PSP.
2571849	2575551	Probably just some minor fixes and stuff and trying to fix it so that no one can crack it.
2576189	2578533	Oh darn, too bad that failed again.
2578713	2585082	So apparently the day after it came out, it was already cracked and the custom firmware 5.0 was released.
2586003	2589108	Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail.
2590410	2592533	So, oh well.
2593837	2597820	Do you think somebody's going to come up with a patch to patch the offensive music back in LittleBigPlanet?
2598380	2604145	Not to go back to that story, but with people that want to keep breaking what Sony destroys.
2604965	2608068	I did want to mention, though, there was a story that we didn't make it in there.
2608528	2613992	One of the things that was included with the new PS3 firmware is there's a recovery...
2614512	2617734	So you can actually help recover your system so it doesn't break, which is nice.
2617754	2619295	I'm glad that they threw that in there.
2637065	2637385	All right.
2637426	2645856	Well, hey, you know, some of the things that they're also kind of reformatting on the Sony side, especially when it comes into the store and how things are being presented on the online store.
2646156	2649420	It looks like companies are now starting to get their own little special stores.
2649920	2651743	Capcom is one of the first we're hearing about.
2651783	2655087	Capcom has their own little like company version of the PlayStation store.
2655527	2660469	If you go to the Capcom store, you can get all of Capcom's stuff kind of in one little place on the PlayStation Network store.
2660749	2663110	You get the Capcom demos, their games, their themes.
2663490	2664470	It's all in one spot.
2664850	2666911	Now, funny enough, this wasn't an idea of Capcom's.
2666951	2670312	It was actually Sony's who, I guess, must have presented the idea to them.
2670652	2674073	And if you think this is going to be only in the Sony side of things, guess what?
2674113	2679515	They're saying that the new Xbox experience that's coming out means that Microsoft will be able to do something similar for their companies.
2680015	2681716	So it's going to be very interesting.
2682116	2683917	You almost now are going to go from one...
2684597	2685598	It's kind of cool in a way.
2685638	2702991	In my mind, I'm envisioning now that online shopping for these networks is now going from one giant everything-stop shop that the company owns, like Microsoft's Walmart or Sony's Target, is now going to be like a strip mall where you can go into the Capcom store and go into the Konami store.
2703712	2705914	It's going to be interesting to see what each company has to offer.
2706955	2711358	It's going to be very, very interesting to see what this does for company branding in the video games.
2711638	2712179	You know what I mean?
2712199	2712279	Yeah.
2713139	2714820	What stores will people visit first?
2715361	2716662	And who puts out what product?
2716842	2721225	Because back in the days of the NES, I don't think a lot of people followed these things.
2723406	2726869	Most people didn't even know that Konami and Ultra were really the same company.
2726889	2729070	They just would follow a particular series or whatever.
2729110	2733814	But it's very interesting now that we have this very company-branded atmosphere that these online stores are going to create.
2734414	2736155	I had to make a response to Geekboy2424 in the chat room.
2736175	2736575	What did he say?
2736595	2739176	He disagrees with me that parents shouldn't police what their children play.
2739437	2739937	Yes, they should.
2739977	2740577	It's the parent's job.
2740597	2740797	However...
2765510	2774813	Don't miss out that I have said parents need to be educated and actually research instead of making a blanket assumption.
2775293	2776973	It doesn't mean parents should put the band hammer down.
2777033	2785816	I think Geekboy2424 is a rather younger listener of ours, which is why I think he might get a little bit hurt that we're saying your parents need to be watching or whatever.
2786316	2788977	But we're not saying the parents need to ban everything.
2789277	2790417	The parents need to be watching.
2790838	2792158	And the parents should at least know what you're doing.
2792398	2792978	Educate themselves.
2793859	2801722	As far as this show is concerned, I don't think folks of a certain age should necessarily even be listening to this show without their parents kind of knowing what they're listening to on the internet.
2801742	2805403	I like to think we're a good influence and not a bad one, but your parents have a right to know.
2805603	2807244	This is my suggestion.
2807264	2808925	This is what I used to do with my mother.
2808985	2812206	True, it was over NES games when I was much younger.
2812786	2816348	But why don't you find a review of the game?
2817088	2822092	Find some video clips of the game, and then say, hey, this is the game that I want to play.
2822673	2823694	Do you mind if we pick it up?
2824495	2833943	And being an adult, hopefully they should be able to make a decision whether or not they consider what you think okay is okay.
2834063	2835884	Recognize some of your passion behind it, too.
2836285	2836625	Exactly.
2836645	2837306	You know what I mean?
2837326	2842190	Maybe you'll get props for like, wow, our kid actually put together a whole little prosecution program.
2842250	2842991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2864810	2865290	That's true.
2865830	2868971	So help your parents make an informed decision.
2869011	2873052	If you truly think that you should have this game, put some effort into it.
2873112	2873672	Let them know why.
2874492	2875393	So my next story.
2875773	2876253	Yeah, go ahead.
2876673	2878113	Sorry.
2878673	2893037	There has been a little bit of a tease now that those who finished the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock get a little teaser trailer saying Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams.
2893797	2896265	is supposed to come out sometime in the future.
2898628	2926818	and there's actually I think some video up around this up on Joystick if anyone wants to take a look at it and it's your typical teaser I watched it just because I thought the first Bioshock was pretty graphically stunning just to tell you the teaser is your typical teaser video it's nothing but you know the one shot of the girl standing on the beach or whatever and the one line it's a teaser in every sense of the word and just the fact it's coming and it gives you that tagline Sea of Dreams
2927518	2927918	That's it.
2928438	2929019	Yeah.
2929139	2930039	That's what a teaser is.
2932100	2934401	So, in other words, Bioshock 2 is coming.
2935202	2935822	Duh!
2935982	2936482	You know what I mean?
2936502	2938163	They needed some teasing to do that.
2938763	2940564	I guess now you have a subtitle, so there you go.
2941404	2942125	When's it coming out?
2942725	2943165	Soon.
2943325	2943645	Soon.
2943906	2944246	Someday.
2944426	2946007	Actually, I don't think it's coming out too soon.
2946387	2946987	A few years?
2947267	2948988	Well, maybe... 2010.
2949288	2950349	Soon is a blanket term.
2950369	2950589	Summer 2010.
2950629	2951249	I don't know.
2951269	2951689	That's a guess.
2951969	2952630	I say summer 2010.
2953990	2954310	I like that.
2954330	2955551	We'll just use that for everything now.
2956550	2956750	What?
2957370	2957570	Summer 2010.
2957610	2959651	That's when all the games are coming out.
2959671	2960911	That's when Final Fantasy XIII is coming out.
2960931	2961131	Summer 2010.
2961191	2963651	We'll be lucky if it comes out by that time.
2964912	2965352	Alright.
2965732	2966252	Release dates.
2967112	2969233	Well, there are other games coming out.
2970233	2970973	This week, at least.
2972253	2977894	Starting off, we've got The World of Goo, which is coming to PC.
2978435	2979655	Fun little casual game there.
2979835	2983156	Did very well on a... I think it's on the Wii already.
2983196	2983596	I'm not sure.
2984216	2984956	As far as a WiiWare...
2986402	2998183	and of course today Rock Band 2 finally made it out on the PS3 also the special edition bundles for PS3 and Xbox 360 are now available
3000492	3004914	The Naked Brothers Band is coming out with a game, a karaoke game.

3009096	3009636	Hooray.

3013118	3014838	Apparently that got delayed from last week.

3051845	3054267	Pass the Pigs coming to DS.
3055067	3057470	That's that old dice game, Pigs, if you remember that game.
3058070	3061091	Oh, where they would land in the certain formations?
3061471	3062791	Oh my god, okay.
3063391	3064751	A whopping 20 bucks for that.
3066912	3068932	Why would you play a dice game on a video game?
3069112	3070513	It's a good travel game.
3070813	3072553	You can't throw pigs around in a car.
3072873	3073633	They'll get lost.
3073673	3074474	Fair enough.
3074494	3076014	Why do people buy Uno on Xbox Live?
3076034	3077994	I throw pigs around all the time, just letting you know.

3239052	3240113	I'm taking a quick look here.
3240834	3243535	Well, let's travel over to Japan, take a look at the Japanese release dates.
3243715	3245836	There's not a lot to speak of on the Xbox 360.
3246717	3251879	NBA Live 09 gets its Japanese localization on October 23rd, that coming out from EA over in Japan.
3252680	3256402	Heading on over to the PlayStation 3, I imagine they're getting the same thing, and they sure are.
3257122	3264746	Also, by the way, on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, Gundam Musou is getting a price reduction on both systems, so if you haven't checked that out yet, you can.

3329721	3355747	on the Nintendo DS Dragon Quest Monsters Joker gets a price reduction as does Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 12 Revenant Wings both getting price reductions as well as far as new games go you got Katsui Death Label as well as Kimi no Yūsha comes out from SNK Playmore on the DS as well as Soul Eater Medusa no Inubu comes out and Wakamama Fashion Gals Mode because I know you were looking forward to that but that is a first party title in Japan so go figure
3356367	3356728	I want Soul Eater
3380029	3380649	You want Soul Eater?
3380889	3385152	I was going to say, there's one small game I missed.
3385272	3385492	What's that?
3385512	3386673	It's coming out a week from today.
3388233	3389894	Guitar Hero World Tour.
3390435	3392376	It will be coming out on everything.
3392396	3394697	Well, that's because it's not a Tuesday game.
3394777	3397318	It's a Sunday game.
3399119	3400180	It's going to be epic, I guess.
3401521	3405526	By the way, to specify, DJ Maxx is the Classic Y edition.
3405606	3407928	There already is several DJ Maxx games on the PSP.
3407968	3408989	This is the Classic Y edition.
3409370	3414916	By the way, one other game I want to point out on the PSP this week in Japan from Sega, Garnet Chronicle comes out as well.
3416001	3417421	DarkSakura, take us to Europe.
3417581	3419482	Here are our European releases.
3419662	3422023	Well, at least as far as the UK is concerned.
3422643	3426764	We have on the 21st EverQuest Seeds of Destruction.
3427625	3428925	I just like saying Destruction.
3428945	3430065	That's pretty freaking awesome.
3430085	3431246	Destruction of Destruction.
3432946	3459847	this should just be ultimate destruction destroying the destructors or something new game from OLR Studios on the 24th we have Dead Space looking forward to that Disaster Day of Crisis, Dungeon Maker Fable 2, which actually my husband has to work for the midnight launch tomorrow so I'm gonna laugh we also have Legendary on Xbox 360 well I don't LittleBigPlanet is given the 24th date um
3461869	3463550	Although we know that's not going to happen anymore.
3463630	3465052	Exactly, but I'm just saying.
3466012	3474399	Also, Midnight Club Los Angeles on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as well as Midnight Club Los Angeles Remix on PSP.
3475039	3477401	Star Ocean The First Departure on PSP.
3479743	3480484	Not too bad, huh?
3481484	3482685	Not a bad week at all.
3483026	3486829	And it's just going to get busier and busier as we get closer to the holiday.
3487489	3490151	Well, that one last game that I had mentioned...
3493041	3494402	Guitar Hero World Tour
3513817	3536317	Polly, Something in the Way, Stay Away, and Territorial Pissings And each of those is available for $2 Or you can save $3 by the whole packet for $11 or $880 But isn't it interesting that it's completely missing like the biggest songs on that album Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are I think was on that album too Isn't that strange?
3536957	3546430	Yeah, it is a little strange, except I think it smells like Teen Spirits in Guitar Hero World Tour, and I'm not sure about the rest of them.
3546670	3549033	Yeah, but it's not like games haven't shared the same songs before.
3549274	3551236	Well, they may have exclusive rights to that song.
3552098	3552778	Money talks.
3553680	3554020	I guess.
3555208	3560253	All right, well, hey, if you have opted for Guitar Hero World Tour, one of the things you can look forward to downloading next year.
3560454	3563257	That's right, they're announcing download stuff for next year on the Guitar Hero side.
3564238	3566300	The brand new Oasis album, Dig Out Your Soul.
3566720	3568903	I had no idea that Oasis was still putting out music.
3569563	3570965	I haven't heard much of their stuff.
3571125	3574589	There's probably some British folks over on the other side of the pond that are like bonk.
3575890	3578591	to me, but they don't play them on the radio at all here anymore.
3579051	3580812	Not since Wonderwall back in the mid-90s.
3581973	3583074	But they are still cranking out music.
3583114	3586976	They have a new album coming out, Dig Out Your Soul, and that will be coming out next year.
3587076	3593280	Some of the singles from that album, Bag It Up, Waiting for the Rapture, The Shock of the Lightning, are all coming out on Guitar Hero World Tour.
3593760	3601124	So if you are an Oasis fan, and you're mad at me for my comment of not hearing them lately, you at least have that to look forward to.
3602145	3602445	There you go.
3604315	3606096	Well, here's some more rumors.
3606216	3606757	Hey, wait a minute.
3606957	3608518	You're the resident Blur fan girl.
3608598	3612641	We haven't heard a lot of Blur, like, I love Blur talk on the show lately.
3613282	3616944	Didn't Blur and Oasis have like a feud thing years ago?
3617525	3618466	Did they ever get over that?
3619286	3626952	I think that, well, since Blur is basically disbanded because Graham Coxon got really offended when they told him, stop drinking!
3628313	3629934	And he's like, well, screw you guys.
3629974	3631555	You throw me out of the band, I'm never coming back.
3632436	3633557	You knew that was the story, right?
3634266	3635751	Did he call them all bloody wankers?
3635811	3637296	Because if he did, that's too good.
3638227	3641268	Probably things a lot worse than calling someone a wanker.
3642448	3646689	However, Graham Coxon has gone off to do his own thing.
3647329	3653491	Damon has gorillas and also has The Good, The Bad, and The Queen, which is pretty freaking good.
3653811	3658412	Well, I was thinking maybe if Guitar Hero is getting Oasis, this might mean Blur for Rock Band.
3658752	3662133	I would totally love it if we had Blur for Rock Band.
3662533	3667574	You know, we need to do a list list just for me of what Blur songs do we want to hear in Rock Band.
3668160	3668820	And those look good, Bob.
3693217	3695198	What I'm eating, by the way, Orange Lounge Foodio for a minute.
3695958	3699940	I found these when I was in the Bay Area this weekend, and I about crapped myself.
3700000	3700841	I was so excited.
3701181	3702622	They're flat fortune cookies.
3703262	3707444	So they're fortune cookies, but they're just ironed out flat and without the fortune, obviously, in them.
3707764	3708845	But I love the taste of fortune cookies.
3708865	3709665	So they're misfortune cookies.
3709845	3710045	Yes.
3710926	3713087	And I know there's probably some of our listeners going, big fucking deal.
3713307	3715468	But you can't get these here anywhere.
3715688	3716148	I've looked.
3716489	3720591	You have to go to the freaking fortune cookie factory in the Bay Area to find them or Long's Drugs, apparently.
3720951	3721331	Go figure.
3722716	3723998	Sorry, random thought.
3724219	3726183	I was just looking at the golden shiny goodness.
3726283	3726944	Would you like one?
3727145	3727826	I would love one now.
3727846	3728507	Alright, here you go.
3728608	3729209	I'm bringing it over.
3729807	3731969	Ooh, cookie.
3732750	3733530	It's like a pancake.
3733630	3734651	It looks like a freaking pancake.
3734691	3735372	Hold up to the camera.
3735412	3739175	Those of you that are watching on Justin.TV, I'll give you a cookie, too, while Jamie reads the story.
3739295	3740076	Okay.
3740136	3751045	Anyway, there is a very shaky teaser trailer up for Guitar Hero Metallica, which I had been hearing them speak of before, so I don't think it's that far off.
3751585	3752346	But it's saying...
3753767	3762833	The trailer is supposed to come with Guitar Hero World Tour, and it has a Ride the Lightning 2009 something.
3764894	3766375	Because that's not cheesy or anything.
3766515	3774120	I think Metallica has finally gotten off of their music, electronic distribution, and just said, cool.
3775182	3779223	No, they still have to do that to be edgy, you know, but they're going for it.
3779403	3784165	And I do also have to say that the Metallica tracks in Rock Band 2 are fucking hard!
3784865	3787086	Maybe they just like playing Rock Band and Guitar Hero.
3787506	3793308	So they decided to, you know, and Guitar Hero comes and says, hey, we'll do a whole freaking game about you guys.
3793468	3794269	And they're like, cool.
3794929	3797190	Or they saw what they did with Aerosmith and were like, we want that shit.
3798570	3803972	Well, and Metallica is the epitome of awesome rock before they sold out, so...
3807078	3825373	I hope for their sake that they learn from Rock Band and decide to go ahead and allow each of those games that they release separately to be able to be downloaded so that you can play tracks in your Guitar Hero World Tour game.
3826094	3827595	Because that would suck otherwise.
3828175	3832259	Especially if there's a lot of games coming out like they were saying that they were going to do.
3832279	3833640	I don't know.
3834987	3835808	Like a cock?
3852543	3854044	Yes, crazy like the cock.
3855365	3862070	Apparently, though, they release a lot of independent games, of course, like I think actually this week.
3862350	3862891	I can't remember.
3862931	3864051	I can't believe I forgot it.
3864372	3866713	Legendary should be coming out.
3867334	3871217	And that's one game that they're publishing as well as Velvet Assassin that's going to be coming out later on.
3871537	3875640	I'm sorry, but they did that Pirates and Ninjas dodgeball game that was horrible.
3875740	3876640	No, that's South Peak.
3876721	3876941	Yeah.
3877481	3879603	Yeah, South Peak did... I'm talking about Gamecock.
3880543	3881924	I thought Gamecock did that game.
3882184	3882645	No.
3884486	3885246	I don't think they did.
3885406	3886547	They may have been publishing it.
3886607	3887008	Whatever.
3887128	3887788	They're a publisher.
3888529	3889249	They don't make the games.
3889269	3891010	They just publish them.
3891991	3893992	Yes, the Pirates and Ninjas Dodgeball.
3894032	3897715	Maybe not exactly the glowing example of their portfolio, but...
3898536	3906766	Legendary looked good, and Mushroom Man sort of okay, but there's a lot more games they're putting out, and they're increasingly getting better.
3907186	3907887	So that's nice.
3909289	3912112	South Peak, on the other hand, they've been releasing what?
3912993	3913474	Overlord?
3914435	3914995	That's pretty cool.
3918069	3919110	Yeah, everyone was pretty sweet.
3920350	3921111	They had some other stuff.
3921611	3924172	X-Blades, I think, was one of theirs as well.
3924953	3930476	I wonder if one of the first orders of business at South Peak is going to be telling the guys at Gamecock to sit down and shut up.
3930696	3933357	Because, you know, they're kind of known for just making a lot of noise.
3933377	3933918	You know what I mean?
3933938	3934598	They just make noise.
3935478	3936399	Some people don't get it.
3936799	3939861	Like, sometimes you kind of look at them and go, they're just kind of weird and need to shut up.
3939881	3940181	I don't get it.
3940301	3941482	I don't think that they're, like...
3942322	3945323	I get the sense Gamecock kind of runs themselves like a fraternity.
3946823	3951665	For real, I get the sense that they have raging kegger parties at some of their company things, events, right?
3952165	3953205	Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that.
3953785	3960707	It seems like this giant gaming fraternity, and I'm sure it's a fun as hell place to work, but sometimes you look at that and go, okay.
3961167	3969890	They have to remember that in every good frat party movie that there's always a montage sequence where they have to pull it together and act a little bit less...
3970430	3971052	Thanks for watching!
3979926	3980827	Grand scheme of things.
3981307	3985570	GameGuru in chat wants to say, South Peak didn't have anything to do with Pirates vs. Ninjas dodgeball.
3985590	3986731	Gamecock published it, though.
3987892	3990474	I thought I saw their logo on that game, and I'm sorry.
3991015	4000862	We talked about this, I think, last week or two weeks ago when DarkSakura's classic game of the week was the dodgeball game from Neo Geo that I thought the Pirates vs. Ninja game was kind of assy compared to Neo Geo 1.
4000902	4002223	I thought it was a dumb idea to begin with.
4002263	4006607	Anyways, they're all, oh, Pirates vs. Ninjas, we're going to sell this match once and for all.
4007287	4008407	with Dodgeball.
4008487	4010008	And I'm like, lame.
4010608	4011108	Tune out.
4011628	4015869	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, if Gamecock has kegger parties, then OLR has pie parties.
4016670	4017110	Not true.
4017150	4018670	Tonight is a flat fortune cookie party.
4018690	4019651	Pancake cookie.
4020151	4021531	And they taste like pancakes too.
4021931	4022511	They're delish.
4022551	4023512	Don't they taste like pancakes?
4023552	4024512	They taste like yummy.
4025362	4027004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4045359	4048020	And there was video and screenshots of them playing.
4048640	4050381	No, it's totally exclusive.
4050461	4066708	Well, sure enough, they've confirmed this week that due to overwhelming fan response, that soon you will be able to download Darth Vader and Yoda in Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the respective versions that are missing it.
4067208	4069609	You'll be able to download them on October 23rd.
4069689	4073591	I'm not sure if that's a US or a Japanese date, but you know it's going to happen everywhere.
4073651	4074211	I mean, come on.
4074531	4079374	October 23rd, you know that's almost exactly three months from the game's release.
4079574	4080374	What a coinkydink.
4080434	4084857	Huh, wonder if they had an exclusive deal for three months.
4085097	4085817	It'll set you back $5.
4087138	4089880	That's 400 Microsoft points, or in Sony terms, $5.
4090700	4092421	Or $4.99, I'm sorry, in Sony terms, $4.99.
4092561	4098545	Because Sony's not going to do anything with that extra penny.
4099147	4100368	Yes, isn't that wonderful?
4100408	4107891	You have to put full amounts, full dollars into your account, but they charge you $4.99, so there's always a remainder.
4107911	4109692	But Loki, credit card fees.
4111153	4112033	Oh, cry.
4115135	4116395	You know, I'm a consumer whore.
4116415	4117216	I'll probably get it anyway.
4117236	4117776	And hell.
4117816	4118937	Just charge even amounts.
4118977	4120237	God, who cares?
4121058	4124199	$4.99 may seem cheaper, but seriously, people know how to do math.
4124219	4125980	They understand it's only one cent cheaper.
4127864	4156694	I'm glad though I can say I told you so I told you so to my friend that said I have to get the PlayStation 3 version of Soul Calibur because it's the only way I'll get to play Vader and secretly I think he just wanted to play me online and I'm like just wait there will be download content it's inevitable and I'll bet you what you know what I bet you money I will bet you money significant amount of money this is not download content it's pay to unlock content money I posted a picture in the chat room by the way of the view from where I sit
4159093	4160173	Well, thank you for that.
4160474	4161374	It's of Rob's head.
4161854	4162334	Oh, great.
4163915	4165015	And one of your pancake cookies.
4165436	4165676	Yummy.
4166036	4166296	All right.
4166496	4171138	Speaking of yummy, resistance to kids like aliens.
4173699	4175360	Kids should not be playing the game because it is mature.
4178898	4184445	The beta for Resistance 2 began on Friday.
4185126	4187970	So for those who got in, let us know how it is.
4188030	4189332	You know, what you can tell us.
4189753	4191074	You know, some opinion here or there.
4191875	4195200	And it's going to be going from...
4197742	4202965	Actually, the 20th of October, so I guess actually that's... No, I'm sorry, that's in Europe.
4203005	4208968	It's starting on Monday the 20th, and it's going to be going on until Thursday the 13th of November.
4209588	4219273	And there will be keys that are given out from IGN, but there's no date as to when those keys will be given out, so keep your eyes on IGN for a little bit more on that.
4219293	4221274	I like how the beta's going longer than actually the game.
4221614	4223695	You know, the game's coming out in the middle of the beta.
4225316	4226677	That's the UK dates.
4227765	4230066	Loki, you try to get into betas that you probably don't belong in.
4230086	4231246	Are you going to get into this one?
4232527	4233387	I'm not even going to try.
4233407	4235068	Alright.
4235448	4239249	I didn't really play much of the... Actually, I didn't play any of the multiplayer in Resistance 1.
4239409	4242831	In fact, I sold my copy back yesterday.
4242911	4243991	But you still enjoyed the game, right?
4244291	4245232	Yeah, the game was awesome.
4245532	4246772	And I will plan on getting it.
4246832	4250314	Unfortunately, I'm in brokery now, so I cannot buy the game.
4251874	4252174	Alright.
4252194	4253255	I'll have to wait a few weeks.
4253595	4254035	Oh, there you go.
4256116	4256476	But, um...
4257386	4258947	Yeah, so, I don't know.
4260067	4263409	The last few multiplayer betas I've been in, Call of Duty 4, I didn't really play much.
4263429	4266390	What else did I get in?
4266471	4268952	Battlefield Bad Company, I didn't even play that at all.
4269452	4272554	I'm a horrible beta tester.
4272634	4275035	For what it's worth, I played the Wrath of the Lich King beta once.
4275851	4278352	I went through all that patching and all that crap to play it once.
4278953	4279433	And that was it.
4279473	4280193	Then I went back to regular WoW.
4280213	4281474	Doesn't that mean you don't have to patch it later?
4282114	4284155	No, it was a completely separate thing.
4284776	4286477	No, because you still have to buy the retail copy of it.
4287017	4289858	They're going to change some things from what was in the beta.
4291179	4296662	Well, it's finally here for those people clamoring to play a translation of Mother 3.
4297683	4302445	You can now download the patch for your ROM that you may have of Mother 3.
4302545	4304246	Of course, you would
4304856	4309098	Need to have an import copy of the game because, you know, to make it legit.
4309178	4311158	But you can now download the patch.
4311258	4316820	The update, which has been worked on for a while now, is finally available.
4316940	4321402	So that's pretty awesome now that you get to play Mother 3, which I don't know.
4321422	4323843	I don't know why they don't just translate it.
4324363	4328885	Seriously, why do they refuse to put that game out over here?
4328965	4332966	I mean, it is literally a refusal on Nintendo's part to just put that game out here.
4340044	4345886	It's just weird how adamant they are.
4345906	4350387	I mean, I can't imagine it costs that much money to translate, but maybe it's because then they have to produce the game.
4350507	4350787	I don't know.
4350847	4352288	It's just sad.
4353408	4357409	And then you look at some of the stuff that is coming out from Nintendo on these systems, and you just go, why?
4358690	4360030	Personal training cooking.
4361849	4363069	That is awesome.
4364110	4374112	Not only are they a little behind in putting that out because there's going to be about four or five other cooking games coming out around the same time, I don't think anyone's going to buy it.
4374272	4382414	I mean, I'm sure there's people out there that actually purchase every single Nintendo game that comes out, but dude, seriously, you might start questioning that.
4384256	4387517	One more story before we get to the classic game of the week and get to our break tonight.
4387597	4397680	Hey, ladies, if you're still looking for a Halloween costume, you know your gamer man in your life might enjoy the sexy lingerie with Ms.
4397720	4399040	Pac-Man's likeness on it.
4399761	4401681	It will look like that Pac-Man and Ms.
4401721	4407023	Pac-Man are eating your boobies because that's what this bra looks like is that you actually have.
4407523	4408303	Pac-Man and Ms.
4408343	4408803	Pac-Man.
4408963	4411324	Or just click on the show roll link and you get this picture.
4411464	4412224	Dude.
4412665	4414985	But it looked, I mean, they're sexy little outfits.
4415005	4415765	I get that.
4415805	4421827	And I like how when the model, like there's a little like, I don't know what you want to call it, like gladiator style skirt with little flaps.
4422187	4428349	And if you lift up the flaps, it reveals Inky, one of the ghosts, or maybe it's Binky or Pinky, I don't know.
4428589	4431210	But on your panties, right where your cooter is.
4431490	4433951	So nice little surprise there.
4433971	4434671	Like, ooh, ghost.
4436464	4442647	And I would like to point out that the ghost is blue, which means it is an appropriate time to munch it.
4444428	4445468	For 200 points.
4448009	4452751	Anyway, 3wishes.com is where you can buy Miss Video Game.
4452971	4455913	Hey, while you're at it, you can also pick up their Chun-Li outfit if you'd like to.
4457173	4458974	I think I shall be clicking on a linky.
4461015	4463536	Are you going to be buying Miss Video Game for Dan this Halloween?
4464577	4465258	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4494801	4499305	And I think this week's Classic Game of the Week is probably one a lot of people have played, I'm guessing.
4500266	4501707	If they haven't, they suck.
4502808	4505069	Or maybe we're too young to see it the first time.
4505089	4505470	Or suck.
4505770	4508392	But you need to go find this game, right, DarkSakura?
4508973	4509393	Or you suck.
4509513	4510694	You can get it on PSP, shit.
4510834	4512395	All right, well, tell us about it.
4512436	4513757	What is this week's Classic Game of the Week?
4514037	4515818	We have two games, but they're together.
4515898	4516379	One's a sequel.
4516979	4518961	It's Parappa the Rapper and Parappa the Rapper 2.
4519001	4522324	So this is music from the first Parappa.
4522344	4522544	Parappa.
4525595	4526917	How do you not know this song?
4526937	4529621	Seriously, the demo came with what?
4538675	4539376	and I'll see you next time.
4559498	4564481	Basically, he goes around rapping against different people, so it's really a music rhythm game.
4564781	4578929	It's like Simon Says, really, where the words that whoever, you know, whichever the masters that you're going against, their words will have a pattern of button presses, and then you have to repeat it for yours, or do something that corresponds.
4578969	4580290	That's actually more proper, too.
4581190	4583991	Um, and of course the better you do, the better your score.
4584111	4588273	If you start sucking, then you go to bad, you're not rapping cool.
4588373	4601838	If you go, if you get from, you know, rapping good to rapping cool, then the stage just completely goes off and you take over and you just have to keep pressing buttons randomly until the stage is over, which was actually the only way I passed the stage from Jeremy Lammy, which we'll get to later.
4603298	4622732	So, um, speak, uh, the game was made by, um, uh, Masaya Matsura, um, who was, uh, actually, uh, one of the, uh, the leader of the Hyperpop unit for, uh, but he was also, um, the company that brought out the game was Nana Onsha, so, if anyone remembers.
4622752	4624273	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Onsha.
4624293	4624954	Yeah.
4626067	4627870	I played this game literally a million times.
4628510	4629432	And Unchamelami.
4629752	4630513	I love these games.
4631595	4635720	Well, your meter, like I was saying before, you have a rapping good.
4635780	4637643	That's when you're doing okay.
4638043	4639325	When you're doing as you're expected to.
4639785	4640767	If you're rapping bad...
4641227	4646469	The art was done by Rodney Greenblatt, and he's got a website that's just got tons of his art.
4646489	4648250	But it also did have a sequel.
4669557	4671118	which we're getting to the music of next week.
4671138	4672858	And we will hear the music from the sequel right now.
4676479	4677499	Well, this is just the start of it.
4677519	4678480	This is from Parappa 2.
4679280	4684902	I didn't put Umjermalami in here, while even though it plays the same, it feels differently, I think.
4684962	4685482	Don't you agree?
4686182	4691764	Yeah, I mean, it is a different game, but it's like, it's not a sequel, but an equal, if that makes sense.
4691784	4695925	Yeah, and Umjermalami and friends make an appearance in this game.
4696525	4698826	But I had to pick the best music in Parappa 2.
4699855	4701096	I think we get a cutscene with this one.
4701116	4702276	I don't know if we go straight to the song.
4702296	4703497	Nope, we go straight to the song.
4703537	4705657	Hey everybody, watch out for those flying noodles.
4705717	4709919	Cause if you don't do well here, all you get to eat are noodles.
4709959	4710680	Here we go.
4710800	4712860	Extra, extra, we'd all about it.
4712920	4714921	I'm back for more because my store's a bore.
4714981	4720223	I travel shore to shore, door to door, looking around for some perfect store.
4720243	4723425	Cut to lettuce, throw to savannas.
4725645	4729390	See if you can find Sister Musation.
4729690	4729951	I will.
4730651	4737300	But anyway, the reason why I had to put Parappa 2 up on there is because the music is just a lot better.
4737320	4738701	It goes into different styles.
4739242	4741485	I really love the Parappa 2 soundtrack.
4743907	4769956	But I had to pick that particular level because there's one stage where Parappa has to trap himself in a video game Or else everybody in the universe has to eat noodles forever And that's as far as I'll say without spoiling the rest of the story of the game If you haven't played it, God knows why you haven't But it also really goes there a lot more stylistically As far as having stages where you change perspective within your 3D environment Like the ant guru
4773144	4779868	or, um, you know, where you, uh... That's from the first Parappa.
4779948	4781229	Oh, I thought you wanted this from the movie show.
4781269	4782490	No, the one from Parappa 2.
4782830	4784011	No, what stage number was it?
4784411	4785532	Four, I think.
4785632	4786372	Okay.
4786552	4789354	Well, this is one of my favorite songs from Parappa, so... Yeah, we'll play a little bit of it.
4799540	4802963	Do you hear how it's doing the multiple things?
4803503	4811209	If you sort of freestyle a little bit with it, it increases your score and if it's good enough, that shoots you into cool mode.
4811810	4812210	Pretty much.
4813691	4828663	You know, so... Now, going back to this, I mentioned it before, is that there is a PSP version and I happened to look into my copy for about $13 when a Hollywood video was going out of business and
4830301	4832963	But, uh, it's, uh, it's the same thing.
4832983	4834864	You've got lots of different versus modes in it.
4835445	4842290	Um, Jammer Lamy, we will, we'll definitely be, uh... Yeah, here's another one.
4855273	4857115	And who could forget the bathroom rap in the first game?
4857135	4857775	God, I know.
4859477	4862079	Especially as often as it's been quoted.
4862979	4871687	But this was, I think that Parappa 2 though, if you can just listen to the difference between how much more complex the music is, I really like it a lot better, personally.
4873448	4886929	Umjermalami was another game that's in the same vein and I was saying I'll probably cover it on another one because it honestly is, I think, different enough within the style of music that it can qualify as a different game.
4887309	4888872	But there was Parabamon in it.
4890194	4895475	Parappa Mode was pretty freaking cool because it turned all these rockin' songs into rap.
4896175	4897616	There are some differences.
4898956	4905678	A few lines that were changed as far as one release to the other.
4907458	4911439	There was an anime, a Parappa anime, that I thought was really, really cute.
4912499	4914421	It came out in Japan.
4914441	4917084	It actually has a really cool little intro song to it, too.
4918085	4933139	But for anyone, when I was speaking about the artist, Rodney Greenblatt, his website is whimsyload.com, W-H-I-M-S-Y, load, L-O-A-D, dot com.
4933480	4934561	That's all one word, dot com.
4935702	4943429	And while his artwork may seem fairly simplistic, he's got some really nice and complex stuff on there.
4943709	4952317	Some sculpture, different medium he uses, and I really admire his work.
4952357	4954199	Give it my recent education.
4963305	4969467	I know all the lyrics to this tune.
4970107	4975629	I remember driving around San Francisco one time after picking up somebody and he brought the CD and we listened to it.
4976469	4977450	In the Rain or in the Snow.
4980310	4989235	We've often referred to as the after effects of certain eating at gym boys as the funky flow.
4990095	4990315	Nice.
4990936	4991836	Yes.
4992256	4992917	Really not joking.
4994037	4997919	But that's their game.
4997980	4999140	It's Parappa and Parappa 2.
4999460	5000221	There you go.
5000261	5001181	Your classic game of the week.
5001201	5004003	Parappa the Rappa and its sequel Parappa the Rappa 2.
5004403	5005384	Two for the price of one.
5006164	5008165	I couldn't mention one without mentioning the other.
5008285	5008705	Right.
5008765	5010166	It's like a necessity.
5010266	5020351	Personally, I like the second Parappa better as a game and music-wise, but you cannot mention the second one without mentioning the one that started it all.
5021011	5021191	Right?
5021511	5022671	You know, you sure cannot.
5023111	5025032	Alright, there you have it, your classic game of the week.
5025192	5026812	And that means it's break time, folks.
5026872	5030293	And when we come back, we haven't even really touched a lot of the Microsoft news going on in the world.
5030613	5034314	Microsoft might be giving out some free memory cards soon.
5034334	5036495	So we're going to be talking about that when we come back from this break.
5037155	5042176	And some other stuff, including that story I referenced a little bit earlier about something in a game that pisses me off a little bit.
5042976	5044357	And this is something...
5045382	5047104	Come participate with Orange Lounge Radio.
5069241	5069681	Orange... Lounge...
5099097	5100718	Hail to the king, baby!
5123317	5124158	I think that we're pretty smart.
5139336	5144040	This is the Oscar clip for tonight's episode, episode number 299.
5144260	5146062	It's going to be a big show next week.
5146082	5151907	Hey, that fart over there must mean that Fart Princess is joining us here in studio.
5151987	5154769	It just surprised us by joining us during the break.
5154789	5155810	I had no idea you were coming tonight.
5155850	5156511	Hi, Fart Princess.
5156531	5156831	How are you?
5157312	5159754	Hi, I was just supplementing the Oscar material.
5159914	5160555	Oh, thank you.
5160655	5160975	Farting.
5161255	5162977	And by the way, she's no longer Rice Princess.
5162997	5163938	She's Fart Princess.
5164957	5165497	You're a liar.
5165698	5167038	Alright, so there you go.
5167499	5170681	And also joining us tonight, I haven't seen you in a long time.
5170821	5171341	Yeah, what's up?
5171542	5172022	How you doing?
5172122	5172482	Pretty good.
5172622	5173723	Now, what are we calling you these days?
5173803	5176725	No, it used to be Casper the Gay, but I now go by the Doctor.
5177025	5178066	Now the Doctor, okay.
5178126	5178466	I'm the Doctor.
5178486	5179347	She's on a screwdriver.
5179587	5181569	I've got a sonic screwdriver right here.
5181609	5183490	Oh, and our guests are extremely loud tonight.
5183530	5184270	I don't know what happened there.
5184310	5184871	I'm very sorry.
5184911	5185872	I left mine at home.
5187473	5188053	We'll figure that out.
5188133	5188994	I'll adjust the volume.
5189514	5189934	Let me see.
5190134	5190715	As we move in.
5190935	5194077	We actually have a listener, I think, called The Doctor, too, and now there's going to be some confusion.
5194097	5195258	I can see Rob's butt.
5195378	5196338	Let me see your Sonic screwdriver.
5196358	5197339	Hold on, I've got to adjust the volume.
5198080	5198760	You've got the little one?
5199420	5199541	Oh.
5200961	5201742	It's not really.
5201782	5202683	It's not Sonic, then.
5202723	5205845	No, but after the show, I'm going to play with Captain Jack's on a screwdriver.
5205945	5207526	Ooh.
5208146	5208646	Oh, my.
5210187	5217192	You know, that's actually what I was planning on doing for Halloween, is getting a blue suit and tie and wearing my Converse's and going as Chick Doctor.
5217628	5219609	Oh my god, that'd be so awesome and then we would match.
5219689	5220290	For our work thing.
5220310	5221431	Because I'm going to be Doctor Who as well.
5221591	5223752	I've actually got, well, I've got the black ones.
5223792	5227695	I was actually either going to do the blue suit or do like a different color suit and be Chick Doctor.
5227835	5228655	That'd be so awesome.
5229056	5230176	It's nice to have guests in the studio.
5230216	5235280	It's been a long time, especially considering episode 300 of this program, if you can believe it, is next week.
5236080	5237001	Oh my.
5237021	5238542	Yeah, episode 300 is next week.
5238742	5239062	Oh my.
5239162	5246587	And we're doing nothing special for it except soliciting congratulations and whatever's memories from our listeners on 877-GAME-OLR when we're not live.
5248168	5249289	You should do something special.
5250470	5252852	We might do some games next week, so you kids should come back.
5253573	5254113	So there you have it.
5254734	5256755	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
5256795	5259157	If you guys want to comment on the news, you have a microphone, feel free to comment.
5259197	5261439	Just refrain from fart noises, Fart Princess.
5261539	5262660	Do we need more fart noises?
5264341	5264641	Alright.
5266243	5273969	I love that I come back from break and talk about what an intelligent show we're having tonight, and then Fart Princess shows up to fuck the whole thing up.
5274657	5276118	What are you talking about?
5276658	5278259	Rob.
5278820	5279080	What?
5280381	5282102	What?
5282902	5283102	What?
5284103	5285584	We have to go from extremes.
5285684	5287485	We have to keep the listeners guessing.
5287505	5291427	There's the show I was missing somehow.
5291447	5291768	And Rob?
5292128	5292308	What?
5293593	5294213	Yeah, great.
5294533	5295394	Let's take this.
5295674	5296914	Oh, how much lower can we go?
5296974	5297194	Yes.
5297254	5304116	Did you ever see that skit on the state where they had the highbrow side and the lowbrow side shifting over to like to the lowbrow?
5304156	5305216	I think I vaguely remember.
5305256	5305516	Yes.
5305616	5306757	Yeah.
5306957	5308237	The state was a cool show.
5308457	5310378	I had the guy who had to put his balls and stuff.
5310478	5312298	Can we get back to the news, please?
5312378	5314359	No, we're supposed to make the show crappy now.
5314679	5317161	Loki, some gaming news for the love of God.
5317682	5325868	So yes, there is this rumor going around that the next Xbox system will be forwards compatible.
5325948	5329992	Yeah, I know you've heard all about backwards compatibility.
5330152	5332754	Oh, but we got the brand new forwards compatibility.
5332774	5334736	We'll play the games of the future!
5335456	5340178	No, really what it means is it will... And I think this technology is already available now.
5340718	5343700	It will make your Xbox 360 games better.
5343920	5349142	Same, you know, either at a higher resolution or make them play smoother.
5349762	5356625	I don't know, like the PlayStation... Isn't that the exact same fucking thing the 360 was supposed to do to original Xbox games?
5356905	5358326	And it does to a certain extent.
5358526	5361727	It does, you know, smooth out the graphics a little bit.
5362367	5362988	And it also...
5363888	5364588	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5386072	5390773	I'll tell you the last system that had true forwards compatibility was the Dreamcast, and I'll tell you why.
5391553	5399674	Because with every new game, they would load a new version of Windows CE that would have an improved running environment for each game that came out subsequent.
5400214	5404035	So, in that respect, that's forward compatibility.
5404875	5406315	We haven't had a system do that since.
5406455	5415477	But it's also firmware updates, and they have those available now, and with each firmware update, it could make your system run smoother.
5417487	5419413	Isn't it just a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo?
5419453	5421360	It is a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo and rumor!
5421601	5423226	Marketing mumbo jumbo, might I add.
5425424	5426244	So who cares?
5426464	5431966	The system isn't going to be out for a while anyways, and we'll listen to all the marketing mumbo-jumbo when that actually happens.
5432246	5433067	Moral of the story?
5433827	5434567	Sega is awesome.
5435207	5435487	Alright.
5436708	5438248	I'm not sure how we got to that, but okay.
5438929	5439569	Dreamcast!
5440449	5445131	Let's read some comments from chat, because our first half of the show tonight was missing too much of the chat room.
5445151	5447291	Let's get some comments from chat, make up for it, part B here.
5447592	5451713	Redertainment says, Forward's compatibility sounds like new things can be promoted and such.
5452093	5454334	Backward's compatibility sounds old and dated.
5455293	5458916	So like with forwards compatibility, Yoda and Vader will already be unlocked.
5459457	5459997	Is that what it is?
5460157	5460397	Maybe?
5461098	5461398	I don't know.
5461418	5461699	Maybe.
5461859	5462119	Sure.
5462139	5463660	All right.
5463800	5465582	You don't even know what the hell I'm talking about, dude.
5465622	5466963	We're like acting right now.
5466983	5467904	All right.
5468344	5474970	By the way, if you're not watching Justin TV, all Rice Princess and the Doctor are doing are beating each other up on cam for your entertainment.
5475010	5475570	So check that out.
5475590	5476471	That's all we're doing.
5476491	5477132	That's all you're doing.
5477592	5477832	All right.
5478612	5480033	Hey, I want to talk about a little bit of news.
5480073	5482093	And actually, this might be something you guys might have an opinion on.
5482133	5482413	I don't know.
5482533	5484174	And this is not out there yet.
5484254	5485634	This news is not out there yet.
5485974	5487815	This actually was my buddy Shane.
5488255	5490275	He's been on the show here before plenty of times.
5490315	5491416	He actually works at a game store.
5491436	5496097	And he sent me a picture from a strategy guide coming out for Fable 2.
5499516	5513343	There are plenty of quality tailors scattered throughout the cities of Albion, and each of them are capable of crafting some fine handmade clothing.
5514804	5523388	Many items are unisex, but those that are designed specifically for one sex carry a cross-dressing rating should the other sex wear them.
5524088	5532791	Heroes wishing to experiment with gender play should consider wearing up clothes of the opposite gender, especially if looking to start a same-sex relationship.
5534411	5535131	Interesting.
5535291	5548796	So, in other words, what I can infer from this, from the strategy guide, is that in Fable 2, if you want to start a same-sex relationship, because you know the game will allow you to basically have whatever types of relationships you want, the way to do that is by cross-dressing.
5549236	5550076	You have to trick them.
5551458	5552759	That's wrong.
5553960	5554420	That's crazy.
5577432	5578553	Nobody applies logic.
5578593	5582076	It's like, you're gay and you like men, not women.
5582136	5584258	Like, why would you... Hello?
5585419	5587461	That's like the epitome of being gay.
5587601	5587962	Hello?
5588422	5597691	You know, and maybe I'm just being a little hypersensitive about this, and I'm just, you know, I'm letting the trigger figure go off too soon on this and being offended, but I'm just kind of like, come on, people.
5598051	5598651	Is this really...
5599352	5599792	Thanks for watching!
5615899	5616660	Yeah, it's dumb.
5616680	5622465	That's what people think, though, because it's like, oh, well, this one girl in a club was like, oh, do you wear panties?
5622485	5624167	And I'm like, I'm not a woman.
5625228	5626209	I don't wear panties.
5626529	5627831	No, that's what they make mantis for.
5628051	5629612	Yeah, maybe mantis.
5630173	5631194	Fruit of the Looms are mantis.
5631234	5631674	Like, I don't know.
5631734	5632735	Well, it's...
5634384	5644388	For all we know, and I don't know how much further into the strategy guide he looked at it, it could be possible that maybe it's just a small start game?
5644468	5649730	No, apparently later in the guide, each article of clothing actually has a cross-dress rating.
5650430	5650730	Okay.
5651030	5652951	So cross-dressing is a facet of the game.
5653231	5654712	And I don't know if it's the guide.
5654832	5655832	I don't know if it's the game.
5655972	5658914	I'm assuming the guide is just reporting on how the game was designed.
5659174	5659734	You know what I mean?
5659774	5662195	But that sentence to me stings.
5662475	5666397	The way they say that is that if you want to improve your chances in a same-sex relationship, you've got to cross-dress.
5667757	5669518	They make it sound like that's an integral part of it.
5670083	5673626	Redertainment in chat says, can I attract people of the opposite gender while cross-dressing?
5673686	5678410	Dude, I know in real life, there's a lot of women that do find that hot, actually.
5678850	5679511	Hell yeah.
5679831	5681252	A man who's comfortable with their sexuality.
5681273	5684215	All the teenage guys that go to cosplay dressed as Japanese schoolgirls.
5684355	5687418	I'm sure there's a lot of chicks there that get off on that.
5687878	5691922	I almost became a cosplay stalker because of this one guy dressed as Utena.
5692142	5692582	There you go.
5693002	5694904	And he looked freaking gorgeous.
5695545	5697106	I was like, I'm going to follow you now.
5697506	5697847	Oh my.
5698818	5703862	Acidic Vampire in chat says, at least you can have a same-sex relationship in The Sims without cross-dressing.
5704442	5706243	I think The Sims is a game that does it right.
5707324	5709846	The game is not about same-sex relationships.
5710146	5712688	The game does not force you to do same-sex relationships.
5713028	5714489	It's just there.
5714889	5715870	Just like in real life.
5716190	5717211	It's just there.
5717391	5719453	In Bully, you have to dress up a little bit.
5719493	5722655	You have to wear your aqua-berry vest to get a kiss from a guy, but that's not too bad.
5723981	5726325	Well, at that point, it was just like, we'll take what we can get.
5726365	5728268	At least there's some representation in this game.
5728288	5729230	Sauce brought up Manfe.
5731954	5734178	And she can put Manfe right away.
5734318	5736221	Nobody is attracted to Manfe.
5738089	5738729	You don't want to know.
5738769	5739350	No, don't, don't.
5739370	5741310	The doctor just asked, what is Manfei?
5741330	5742591	Don't do much, Cowboy Bebop.
5743251	5744051	No, he doesn't.
5744332	5746272	Don't even bring up the picture, please.
5746593	5747053	Rob, do it.
5747813	5748313	I have to.
5748333	5749294	We need a reaction shot.
5749334	5750974	This is... It's news.
5750994	5751555	This is radio.
5751575	5752175	This is news.
5752215	5755936	Can you describe what Manfei is while I pull up the picture and chat here, for those of you who don't know?
5755956	5766601	The character of Fei in Cowboy Bebop has been cosplayed... Yes, a woman has been cosplayed by many pretty women and one hairy man.
5767856	5768677	That is Manfei.
5769979	5771421	Rob, share the picture of the chatroom, please.
5774464	5776167	Sailor Bubba is a close second.
5776427	5776867	Oh, yeah.
5777108	5777608	Oh, God.
5779451	5779811	Shudder.
5780993	5781593	There you have it.
5785596	5786436	Oh, oh.
5786496	5790077	No, I've been at conventions where Manfe has been present, so.
5790177	5790997	And see, look, look.
5791257	5793397	Manfe, we're all sitting here and laughing at.
5793477	5795118	And that's why I don't like this in the game.
5795158	5797018	Because we sit there and laugh at cross-dressers.
5797458	5797798	I don't know.
5797818	5798558	I mean, sometimes we sit.
5798578	5799818	And I don't think that should be associated with same-sex.
5799838	5801279	Okay, because they're obviously doing it for comedic relief.
5801419	5803499	This one person is cross.
5803819	5804519	It's cross-play.
5804659	5804919	I mean.
5805299	5806020	Cross-play.
5806040	5806360	I like that.
5806380	5807020	No, it's what it's called.
5807040	5807220	It's real.
5807660	5811901	Because, I mean, I know plenty of female cosplayers who do male characters.
5812881	5814301	To comedic effect, I must say.
5814361	5814661	And that's hot.
5815956	5817738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5833440	5836082	Shaoran in chat says, my friend saw Manfe at her first con.
5836122	5837083	I feel so bad for her.
5837443	5852594	All right, getting away from Manfe and all this funny stuff for right now, going kind of back to the point is that, and this is what I was talking about earlier, DarkSakura, when we were talking about the other story, and I was talking about, it's hard for me to sit here and go, oh, people should not find this offensive, when in the same breath, I'm looking at this story, and I'm going, you know what?
5852714	5855556	I'm kind of sort of offended at this story.
5855576	5856917	I think it's different, though.
5857338	5858859	It is, but I can't put my finger on it.
5858939	5860160	Why should I be offended
5861020	5868185	The difference being is that this is a specific component integral to the game.
5868725	5873368	This is something programmed specifically into the game as a facet of gameplay.
5874088	5879892	The other is background music that was made by someone of that faith.
5882253	5888577	Now, if that had been programmed in by the most flaming of all gay people ever, would you be as offended?
5888597	5888637	No.
5890069	5891991	Yes, because I think that person should know better.
5892011	5899437	Okay, but if that person personally thought it was funny and wondered why people would be offended... I mean, I'm not like offended.
5899937	5900938	Offended is not the word.
5901178	5902019	I'm disappointed.
5902499	5910026	I'm disappointed that it's 2008 and this is what I'm reporting on, is that cross-dressing in the game will help your chance of same-sex relationships.
5910046	5911787	It's just kind of like, can't we just move on?
5912348	5914850	You know, why can't it just be...
5916090	5923375	If this game wants to be so big about you have the character you want and you program the same way, why can't you just be?
5923635	5933640	Why can't you just be the hero with muscles and, I don't know, worked out, whatever, wearing manly clothes that attracts a lot of women and 10% of men?
5933961	5934441	You know what I mean?
5935421	5936222	Why can't we just have that?
5938427	5939507	You know what I think it should be?
5940207	5944409	Because keep in mind also, not everyone who cross-dresses is gay.
5945310	5945870	We know this.
5946270	5947271	Yes, very, very true.
5947431	5949892	Not everyone who is gay cross-dresses.
5950152	5951293	Also, importantly true.
5952210	5952670	Exactly.
5953171	5957955	And there are people, though, who cross-dress because they want to be that gender.
5958735	5971685	I think that if they were going to incorporate something like that in the game, and true, it would be some very complex programming, I do believe, it should be that you have the option of how you are going to make use of that option.
5971885	5972386	You know what I mean?
5973227	5977270	If you want to cross-dress because you want to be a woman, you should have that as an option.
5977770	5978611	I want boobs.
5979572	5983755	Solid Goomba in chat says, I want to be a man in a dress and have a relationship with a woman.
5984436	5985237	More power to you.
5985617	5988499	I do think the game should allow that if that's what you want.
5989300	5989721	You know what I mean?
5989741	5991402	I don't think cross-dressing should have a bearing on it.
5991442	5991702	I don't know.
5991742	5992263	Maybe I'm just...
5993459	5993939	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6012327	6013608	I'm just kind of getting sick of it.
6013888	6020211	One of these days I would just like to have a normal person who happens to be gay in my video game.
6020671	6022412	Just like in TV and all that.
6023333	6026675	If sexuality is not a part of the game's device at all, then fine.
6026775	6028496	We have no defined sexuality in the game.
6028516	6029396	That's just fine by me.
6029716	6036140	But amongst these RPG love stories, I would like one day for there to be a same-gender one that is not stupid.
6037100	6038763	if that makes sense.
6038783	6048477	That actually goes back to what I was talking about about the sort of singular directional bigotry, you know what I mean?
6049659	6050300	I think that
6053660	6056703	Every relationship is going to have its moments of dysfunction.
6058125	6061088	Some may have a very odd origin.
6061448	6062990	I ordered my husband on the internet.
6064551	6074402	I think that if it's going to have a quirk to it, the quirk should be there because of the people involved, not because of their orientation, right?
6076832	6077473	Oh, go ahead.
6077693	6078473	Just one other thing, though.
6079214	6086358	I think, though, that having an active... I don't even think it should be an active choice.
6086378	6089420	I think you should just start up your character and be born gay or not.
6089640	6090320	Because really, isn't that...
6092081	6094542	For the most part, I think it's genetic.
6094963	6096823	But I digress.
6098364	6104487	I think that as far as it being a part, that does determine a lot of who your character is.
6105407	6108869	But it does not define who your character is.
6110057	6110898	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6132932	6133332	Fair enough.
6133632	6135633	But how often does religion come into video games?
6135853	6140715	Of course, then again, saying all that with what we talked about earlier.
6142856	6147238	And then immediately follows that up and says, just because they always grab coins doesn't mean they're Jewish.
6149919	6151300	See, I like that you can have a little fun with it.
6151320	6152861	Mario's Catholic, you know that.
6152921	6154022	I like that you can have a little fun with it.
6154343	6157005	Alright, look, let's just move on.
6158145	6160347	Everybody's talking about they want to see representation of themselves.
6160367	6162769	GS68, I want more Filipino-Filipina characters, dammit.
6163870	6166652	I'm sure there's a lot of people saying I want to see a little more of this in games.
6166832	6170174	So maybe it's time for diversity the game.
6170234	6170635	I don't know.
6170735	6171936	It's a small world, the game.
6172176	6172516	Who knows?
6173197	6173477	I don't know.
6173717	6174277	Let's move on.
6174478	6176039	There's plenty more gaming news to talk about.
6176179	6177840	If you want to talk more about it, email us.
6178140	6178661	Call us later.
6179181	6179761	DarkSakura.
6181622	6184622	Take us to a game that has nothing to do with sexuality, religion, or race at all.
6185802	6187363	This one's about falling into holes.
6188543	6190183	That could be construed as sexuality.
6191604	6193684	Yeah, but how many holes do people really fall into?
6193704	6195104	I mean, sometimes... Oops, I tripped.
6195124	6195824	There's a vagina.
6196045	6198285	You might wake up with a hangover.
6198325	6200025	I think I fell into a hole while I was drunk.
6200585	6200986	Anyway, sorry.
6201006	6201366	Go ahead.
6201666	6202326	Okay, anyway.
6202886	6207247	Portal Still Alive is going to be on Xbox Live Arcade.
6209523	6213385	It will be up on Wednesday, October 22nd.
6214185	6227192	And it has the one that came out earlier plus 14 new exclusive challenge maps and 6 advanced maps and new achievements.
6228272	6233035	So in other words, if you bought the orange box just for this game, haha sucker, you're going to buy it twice.
6234365	6237006	But is Portal a game that you really mind buying twice?
6237126	6238386	I mean, it is pretty freaking good.
6238406	6240066	There are different levels, to be fair.
6240086	6240786	Yeah, to be fair.
6241026	6241266	I know.
6241666	6243507	There needs to be more GLaDOS.
6243747	6244207	On the PC.
6246527	6248348	First there will be cake, and then you will be baked.
6249168	6251288	But there's no story in the extra levels, right?
6251328	6252028	They're just kind of there.
6252048	6253068	It's just more crazy.
6253088	6256929	Will you be taunted by GLaDOS in these bonus levels, or are they just extra puzzles or something?
6257169	6258569	What's the point of not being taunted?
6259089	6259449	I don't know.
6259930	6261550	That's why I'm curious to see how...
6263996	6265537	How milked is this game?
6265717	6266698	That's what I want to see.
6266738	6269840	Are they really just milking it, or did they actually put a little thought into it?
6270101	6271822	That's what I'm really curious to see.
6273802	6301705	who knows well one thing that you can probably store that brand new game on would be a hard drive or a new memory unit and remember Microsoft was saying with the new Xbox experience that you would need some sort of storage device in order to download it because it does take 128 megs of space well their solution for people that I don't know how they went about existing with an Xbox with no storage whatsoever because that means you can't save games or anything
6303666	6310671	They are offering a free 512MB memory unit, or for $20 you can buy a 20GB hard drive.
6310731	6317876	Now, in order to qualify for this, you have to have a core system, or some arcade systems may qualify as well.
6318456	6329684	Basically, just go to their website, they have available for that, which is xbox.com, go to their support page, and there's a memory update thing where you enter your
6334148	6335870	And if you're eligible, they'll let you buy them.
6336150	6340156	If you're not eligible and you happen to have an arcade system, that's the other option.
6340657	6343982	For $29.99, you can get a 20GB hard drive and a 3-month live card.
6344582	6346465	Which is not a bad deal either.
6347707	6348488	Here's my question.
6350489	6352810	When I got my Xbox 360, I have a core.
6353110	6356832	Because I got my system during that time when Xbox 360s were really hard to find.
6357132	6362473	So I just ponied up the 20 extra dollars or whatever it was to buy the hard drive and the core system separately.
6362754	6365434	So is Microsoft going to know that I've had a hard drive this whole time?
6365494	6367775	No, it's all by the console ID number.
6367815	6368275	Sweet!
6368535	6369796	I get a free memory card!
6369816	6370936	Right?
6371096	6371316	Yes.
6371637	6371977	Awesome!
6371997	6372537	Just put it in your...
6373237	6374218	I'm good on your device.
6374258	6374578	Why not?
6374619	6375039	It's free.
6375660	6377201	Microsoft doesn't know that I have a hard drive.
6377862	6384949	And even though I do, why should I be treated differently from the other owners that bought the core early on, early adopters?
6385369	6386831	Yeah.
6387351	6389333	Yeah, for 20 bucks you can get a 20 gig hard drive.
6390434	6393818	That could just be the drive I install Final Fantasy XI on and never use.
6396627	6404857	or it could be, or better yet, it could be because I only have a 20 gig hard drive as it is now, I could have two drives and one of them can be like the movie's drive and the other one can be the game's drive.
6405257	6405558	Why not?
6406459	6410484	So I think, to be honest, I think that's an awesome solution for their problem.
6411185	6412066	And really, I mean...
6414135	6415376	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6430137	6430878	No, it's not.
6430918	6431258	No, hold on.
6454454	6459916	and HendersonManInChat says, Sky, I have a core, but it would not let me have a free memory card, so somehow they know.
6460236	6461337	That's from HendersonManInChat.
6461617	6462937	I don't think it's going to, eh.
6463097	6464378	Now I'm really curious.
6464398	6464878	I'm going to try it.
6464958	6466138	I'll let you guys know what happens next week.
6466158	6468799	Well, I've got about five different ones we can try.
6470000	6470700	We'll see what happens.
6471100	6472321	I mean, I don't know.
6472621	6478163	Actually, I want to get a bigger hard drive, but if I can get a 20 gig hard drive, another one for cheap, I'll do that switch out idea.
6478203	6479063	I think it's a great idea.
6480444	6480944	So we'll see.
6482748	6486369	Anyhow, thank you Microsoft for giving us some free stuff, right?
6487469	6487749	Oh yes!
6503072	6512174	They're trying to increase the amount of compatibility that occurs between the two, with the media sharing and the things that go on between the 360 and the Zune.
6512614	6519055	Well, actually, recently, some folks over at Gizmodo were talking about the new Gears of War Zune that's coming out.
6519335	6522216	And they were actually talking to Microsoft's marketing director.
6522836	6530838	And the marketing director was talking about that there is going to be a big step-up happening in the Zune 360 integration within a year.
6531832	6532913	So, that's all.
6532953	6537656	It's a very vague statement, but that supposedly it's going to step it up within a year.
6538076	6540238	Any thoughts as to what that could possibly be?
6540438	6543901	Well, they already have the X and A support that's supposed to be coming to it.
6543941	6545602	Maybe they're going to flesh that out a little bit more.
6546222	6549244	And maybe it would be kind of cool if they actually put some games on there.
6549705	6556009	Like, you know, they could even be like the Pocket Station stuff where you play a little mini game and you earn points for a game or something.
6556029	6557610	I have a thought, and I bet money I'm right.
6558311	6558611	Movies.
6558631	6558791	Movies.
6559983	6563764	You're going to be able to play movies on the Zune that you bought on Xbox.
6563804	6564644	I could see that happening.
6564924	6566785	It's going to be how they're going to compete with iPod.
6566825	6570646	Rob, remember when they were talking about the Zune E3?
6571326	6571486	Right.
6571826	6576388	And didn't they bring up something to that effect that it would be like a multi-entertainment?
6577948	6586050	I remember going in there with my camera and then telling you to turn it off at the Xbox 360 thing, and they were talking about having portable content.
6587130	6588651	So perhaps this is what they intended.
6588671	6588751	Yeah.
6589349	6592193	Cobra Kid says more XNA games to it in chat.
6592474	6592814	That's true.
6592854	6594637	They have that whole XNA thing coming out soon.
6594858	6595979	That could be a big part of it too.
6596059	6596841	So maybe it's all of it.
6597542	6601848	It could be just as much as the iPhone interfaces with your Mac or even your personal computer.
6601868	6603250	Maybe the Zoom will interface with the Xbox 360.
6603290	6603491	Who knows?
6606892	6608613	Will there be enough people that use it?
6609034	6610535	Or just a quick question in chat.
6610875	6613498	Let's say the Zune could do all of those things you suggested.
6613798	6615740	Let's say the Zune can do the XNA games.
6616080	6618403	Let's say the Zune can do the movies and all that stuff.
6619143	6620505	Would you be interested in a Zune?
6620825	6621225	Chat room.
6622689	6625092	As opposed to an iPhone or any of the other stuff that's out there.
6625112	6626253	Let's say you can only have one player.
6626293	6627575	Would you pick Zune?
6628435	6629336	Comment from Tigerclaw.
6629677	6631899	Tigerclaw says, doesn't Zune have built-in Wi-Fi?
6631919	6632840	They could make apps for it.
6632880	6637024	Like, for example, someone would eventually make an internet radio app to tune into the shoutcast streams over the Wi-Fi.
6639207	6639547	We'll see.
6640488	6643832	We'll come back to that story just after we get this next story out of the way.
6645293	6675002	this actually makes me a little bit happy even though I already own the game on multiple platforms Marvel vs. Capcom 2 which honestly I thought the first one was a little bit better but it actually has an ESRB rating now for PS3 and Xbox 360 so that leads speculation that it's going to be a downloadable version maybe like a Xbox Live Arcade or something like that
6675322	6676044	and that's pretty cool.
6676084	6677006	I mean, it's a good game.
6677647	6678709	So I'm looking forward to that.
6678949	6680953	It's a fucking awesome game, you mean, by good.
6681474	6682977	Well, I thought the first one was better.
6683579	6683979	Fair enough.
6685562	6687186	It's all about playing a strider here, you anyway.
6688450	6691911	Okay, looking at chatroom comments from the last story because we asked you guys, would you get one?
6692131	6695133	And would you get a Zune if they implemented all these features?
6695433	6697033	VXJSNXV says, Zunes blow?
6697533	6698334	Ranma says, yes.
6699014	6701615	GameGuru says, maybe, but I'm more interested in PSP right now.
6701935	6703075	Shaoran says, sure, why not?
6703936	6706437	VXJSNXV continues, I have my iPhone and I'm happy with it.
6706877	6709638	Redertainment says, does it do much better than my current touch?
6709838	6710598	If not, no.
6710698	6712379	I need a gross incentive to jump over.
6712639	6713319	That's how I feel.
6713519	6716581	There's got to be something really big to get me to have a Zune as well as an iPhone.
6717921	6719642	Cobra Kid says I would have to get a bigger Zune.
6721442	6724623	Deakman says I'm telling you they'll merge the music card and the gamer tag.
6725203	6725923	I didn't even think of that.
6725963	6726363	That could be.
6727064	6727524	So we'll see.
6728544	6728864	Alright.
6729865	6733145	So Marvel vs. Capcom 2 hopefully coming soon as it says.
6733746	6734706	Meanwhile, some other news.
6738291	6738712	Right, Loki?
6739152	6739513	Yes.
6739833	6741496	Sorry, someone was stepping on my mic.
6742397	6743659	Are our guests being unruly?
6744019	6745161	They are being very unruly.
6745181	6746583	Do they need to be punished?
6746803	6748846	We're playing Naughty Tic-Tac-Toe.
6749907	6751029	Anyways, um,
6752190	6758093	If you live in Europe, you're going to be in for a lot of holiday bundles for the Xbox 360.
6759074	6763016	They are getting quite a few, in fact, starting last week, actually.
6764236	6768939	The value packs that are available pretty much all around the world will be available for them as well.
6769039	6772661	That includes, of course, the games packed in LEGO Indiana Jones Kung Fu Panda for both
6773001	6779883	The Elite and Pro, and the Sega Superstar Tennis, and of course the Xbox Live Arcade Games.
6780944	6796449	Starting, looks like, November 7th, they're going to be getting two more bundles, both with the 60GB Pro system and either Gears of War 2 bundled in, or James Bond 007 Quantum of Solace bundled in.
6797050	6798950	And those are going to both be available for 269 euros.
6802012	6807876	Starting the 21st of November, there's going to be another one with Tomb Raider Underworld.
6808537	6813621	And that's also a pro system, the 60GB, with a 1200 Microsoft Points card.
6814021	6815563	And that's also available for 269 euros.
6815583	6825330	And then finally, the last-ditch effort before Christmas, there's another 60GB pro system bundled with Prince of Persia.
6826051	6827192	And that will also be for 269 euros.
6827212	6827252	So...
6831135	6835016	A little bit more expensive than your normal games, your normal pro system.
6835896	6839717	I mean, basically, you're kind of paying for the game itself anyways.
6841337	6843938	But hey, that's kind of neat, I guess, if you're shopping for the holidays.
6845878	6847119	Lots and lots to pick from.
6847559	6849799	Why do you think so many bundles over there are supposed to here?
6850359	6856821	I think it may have been just, you know, and I'm not even sure if it's actually... It could very well be like different...
6858137	6859841	Thank you for watching!
6869895	6871156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6893557	6894658	on certification from Microsoft.
6894678	6901285	I'm sorry, they are currently verifying the updates and then they're going to be sending it off to Microsoft for certification, which has probably already happened.
6902506	6904067	Kind of took them long enough in a way.
6904087	6909052	I mean, with as long as this game took to come out, I mean, couldn't they just kind of like fix this before it came out?
6909532	6910193	I mean, I don't know.
6910233	6911753	I guess, you know, they didn't know.
6911873	6912634	They tested the game.
6912654	6913414	They didn't find it.
6913454	6914215	Mistakes happen.
6914255	6914775	Blah, blah, blah.
6915155	6916236	But it's a little bit frustrating.
6916256	6919918	This game's been out how long and you still can't really have a multiplayer game on it.
6920318	6923900	But I guess to their credit, you know, a lot of people bought this game anyway.
6924240	6929243	And hearing about this patch is just going to cause another wave of people running out to get this game.
6929544	6934947	Whereas a lot of Xbox Live Arcade titles kind of have one shot the week they come out and then they kind of slip into obscurity.
6935327	6937868	So maybe it was pre-planned.
6937928	6938248	Who knows?
6938569	6939089	I doubt it, though.
6940356	6940616	All right.
6941636	6948898	Well, something pre-planned on Orange Lounge Radio is that every week we are going to take some time to read your emails that you send us to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
6949438	6950698	Why are you boycotting the mailbag?
6951258	6951598	Cookie.
6952378	6954539	I will get you a damn cookie if you read the emails.
6954859	6959059	Hey, Fart Princess, Doctor, do you guys want... I have flat fortune cookies.
6959099	6960200	They taste like pancakes.
6960780	6961440	They taste like pancakes.
6961460	6962060	Yeah, I want one.
6962240	6962480	All right.
6962660	6963140	Oh, my.
6963220	6963860	All right, I'll get some.
6964400	6965580	While DarkSakura reads us some email.
6972018	6975200	There is an email that I should have sent in response to you directly, Rob.
6975700	6977982	And I don't know if I should read it on air.
6978122	6981844	Well, if you read this first, then I'm going to have to wait on the cookies.
6982344	6983885	Okay, you can just read it at your leisure.
6984385	6986206	Well, give me a brief idea what it's about.
6986286	6988328	It's from Spazinator.
6988788	6989088	Hi.
6989588	6991670	Telling you what games you should get for PS3.
6993931	7000214	Oh, didn't I say... I think I said a while back about something like I need more games that I should... Yeah.
7000295	7000835	What games?
7001380	7012505	LocoRoco, Cocorecho, Lemmings, Elefunk, EchoChrome, WipeoutHD, Everyday Shooter, SuperPuzzleFight Are you farting glasses?
7012525	7014966	What are you doing?
7016686	7017407	Knock it off.
7017747	7018387	I'm trying to do a show.
7018407	7019167	So yeah, those games.
7020068	7024069	Wait, so they just list every game that happens to be exclusive?
7024089	7025410	A list of 36 games, Rob.
7025430	7027831	So just basically all the PlayStation 3 exclusives?
7028832	7030133	Um, some.
7031153	7031613	Some or not.
7031713	7033995	To be fair, I'm going to get a PlayStation 3.
7034435	7036836	It's just LittleBigPlanet's out sooner rather than later.
7036856	7038217	It'll probably happen this week.
7038437	7042018	There's more tips on what else you should get along with and what you should look for.
7042619	7048461	I'm having surgery soon, so, you know, probably having a Blu-ray player will be a good thing while I recover.
7050983	7053604	So, let's go on to the next email while I go get the cookies.
7053984	7057466	The next email is actually from...
7059680	7060080	Heart Heart Heart
7092106	7100394	and then, we only really have one other email.
7101813	7107256	Um, and it's actually from, um, Dan Shadow.
7107756	7111819	So, hey guys, my nephew's birthday was last week so I missed the show.
7112279	7116101	Took him to the movie of his choice and he chose, wait for it, quarantine.
7116681	7118002	Yeah, it sucked so bad.
7118582	7122605	I mean, it was so bad that people would start talking during the movie and no one cared.
7123085	7123785	Fucking rabies.
7125146	7129827	Anyways, been trying to catch up on my OLR since I had to leave in the middle of another episode.
7130427	7137189	Just got one episode on Friday and I'm sure... I guess you meant to have the word... Rob?
7138610	7139250	I'm on the last email.
7140450	7140950	Rob's gay.
7144451	7145851	I'm sure I'll get the other one soon.
7146372	7147752	Been playing Dead Space this week.
7147792	7150693	I recommend it to anyone who has a good sound setup.
7151133	7151493	Thank you.
7151693	7152093	Ooh, quickie.
7153902	7157644	It's not as scary visually as much as it is audibly.
7159105	7163908	The visuals are great, they're just not as scary as the EA's been telling all of us.
7164729	7166169	Man, can you believe the news this week?
7166189	7170212	LittleBigPlanet gets delayed, Ghostbusters gets picked back up, and Obama's appearing in video games.
7170632	7172173	Didn't a caller bring that up a few weeks ago?
7172893	7175255	Oh, and before I forget, Ballhair says hi.
7176095	7178096	He's got a last name now and he's doing well.
7178156	7183579	He's got a guild and we're at guild level 14 at this moment and we're talking keeps.
7184760	7185600	And we're taking keeps.
7186160	7187201	Is it Ballhair Jenkins?
7187261	7187621	Oh wait, no.
7187641	7189222	Ballhair was a Warhammer character, right?
7190323	7190823	Yeah, I'm looking.
7191003	7193324	Okay.
7193724	7194505	Ballhair Trimmer.
7195305	7196066	The Dawnbringer.
7197126	7197446	Nice.
7197867	7198147	Alright.
7198887	7199628	Ballhair Trimmer.
7199768	7200508	That's lovely.
7201048	7201509	That's great.
7202309	7203270	And Ballhair got a guild.
7203310	7203970	Congratulations.
7206752	7207632	That's it for email?
7208412	7208512	Oh.
7210153	7211233	We have one from Redertainment.
7211833	7212814	Less email, more cookie?
7213174	7213534	Oh, yes.
7213654	7214034	One more email.
7214054	7214514	I'm eating cookie.
7214834	7215074	Alright.
7215934	7217335	And this is actually in response.
7217615	7219135	But we were CC'd on this, so I'm gonna read it.
7219275	7219555	Alright.
7222096	7223516	I brought... This is from Redertainment.
7224376	7229798	I bought LittleBigPlanet on Friday and found out about the recall right before I sent this message.
7230498	7233899	What the expletive deleted for Bobby, fuck for OLR, should I do?
7235131	7239893	Should I contact Sony, wait for a patch, or keep the game as a collector's item and buy another copy?
7240734	7241554	Thank you for your time.
7259628	7263009	Yeah, well, he probably already did because he didn't know about the change.
7264309	7265010	Just hang on to it.
7265090	7271992	Sony's going to patch it out anyway, so you're not going to really have a choice because they're doing both, but the serial number on that box will make... Unless you want to disconnect yourself from the internet.
7272312	7275793	It's going to be like those pennies that have, like, the misprint on the back.
7275973	7276953	You know, those type of things.
7276973	7277533	That's what it's going to be.
7278574	7282795	If you want to play your copy that's been unedited, then disconnect from the internet.
7284976	7288797	Yeah, Red Entertainment's in chat right now and says he already opened it because how would he know that it was going to be recalled?
7289017	7289157	So...
7290697	7291417	Can't say I blame you there.
7292178	7292778	All right, let's get back.
7292818	7293679	If that's it for Mailbag.
7293899	7294259	That's it.
7294499	7296180	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7296440	7300482	While we chow down on cookies, Loki the cookie hater will bring us back to some gaming news.
7300502	7301123	There's one more thing.
7301603	7303384	Ow, I hit myself in the face with the microphone.
7303524	7304184	Was that the thing?
7305405	7306085	You know what, Rob?
7306485	7306686	What?
7308266	7318372	You know, one thing that I every so often will get an email on and didn't this time, and I meant to plug it during my Classic Game of the Week, was a review done by Sauce.
7319864	7321245	Oh yes, I was reading about this on Twitter.
7322446	7323627	And I am getting the link now.
7324308	7328251	If you go to twitter.com slash Mar and Marvel, there is a link to it.
7329171	7333115	And her review of the week is ActRaiser, her classic game review.
7334396	7335537	I know, isn't it great?
7336037	7339059	We just had an exclamation of, I love ActRaiser.
7340160	7341241	So go look at it.
7341301	7342242	I'm linking it in the chat room.
7343323	7344304	And I'll link it on our Twitter.
7344824	7346705	Irene's god name in ActRaiser is...
7349650	7350050	Actraiser.
7350090	7350811	I love Actraiser.
7350871	7351272	How funny.
7351312	7353494	That's what I named Link in Legend of Zelda was poop.
7354275	7354595	Wow.
7354635	7355256	Copycat.
7355656	7357839	I named him GGG because I was lazy.
7359180	7359641	Nice.
7359901	7361723	I named him Zelda so I could get the extra.
7361763	7362123	No, I'm kidding.
7362664	7362944	All right.
7363565	7364586	Back to news.
7364646	7365147	Cookie Hater.
7366417	7372498	Okay, well, there is some controversy around another game, Saints Row 2.
7372939	7378620	Apparently, New York police unions condemn Saints Row 2 because, well, you kill policemen in the game.
7379480	7389322	And according to them, New York's powerful police unions say that a violent new video game called Saints Row 2 is an abomination.
7389843	7395884	In the game, the players control a gang member who can steal, do drugs, kill as many characters as possible, including...
7396404	7397186	Thanks for watching!
7409315	7410335	College Students.
7411095	7415556	Do we hear any unions for college students coming out, you know, saying this game sucks?
7415596	7416937	I'm a college student and I'm offended.
7418917	7420977	Or taxi drivers or rednecks.
7421037	7423018	Do unions for students exist?
7423238	7425038	It's not like a paying job.
7425198	7427139	I guess that makes sense, huh?
7428699	7429119	I don't know.
7429139	7432800	The whole thing is just like, okay, this doesn't take place in New York, so...
7436366	7441068	Before this game, no one's ever thought, hey, let's make a game where we can kill cops in it.
7441628	7443549	This is the first game to ever do that.
7443629	7445769	Thank you for pointing this out.
7447330	7453392	This also, I might add, comes from WPEC News 12 Now.
7456093	7460554	They're a CBS affiliate in, I would assume, the New York area.
7462623	7466329	Redertainment in chat says, I'm mad because they can kill redheaded dorks.
7468192	7468492	Me too.
7468572	7470736	I should be angered about that too, actually.
7471557	7472618	So is the doctor.
7472659	7473460	He's waving his hand over there.
7473500	7474061	I'm pissed too.
7476431	7478612	Yeah, I don't even know where the hell this takes place.
7478672	7484194	It's somewhere on the East Coast that this actual newscast is from.
7484814	7487615	To which the legend of Zaku promptly follows up and says, Yay!
7487715	7489476	I didn't know you could kill gingers in the game.
7489496	7492217	Like, it's incentive to buy it now.
7494758	7495598	Oh, gingers.
7497139	7500000	Alright, Ranma... Oh, North Carolina!
7500420	7502021	Not even close, senor!
7502181	7504942	Ranma in chat says News Channel 12 is a local cable news network.
7508007	7514134	All right, well, look, you know, this kind of just dumb assedness always brings on our FUs of the week.
7514795	7517979	And especially since Saints Row is a game that Loki loves and adores.
7518039	7520202	How dare the police department condemn it?
7520322	7521404	They can condemn it all they want.
7535984	7546211	DarkSakura, FU's The Week, The Election Season, all of it, and, um, uh, Sarah Palin for thinking she's funny.
7548193	7548493	Loki.
7550394	7561102	Um, god, I had something early that I was mad at about, but I don't remember, so, FU to News 12, because they have, looks like a
7562048	7564090	Cast of douchebags that run this thing.
7564670	7566371	They're all kind of ugly in weird ways.
7567832	7572055	My FU of the week goes to still not having a solid date for my surgery.
7572216	7581282	I think I know when it's going to be, but because some people haven't gotten to my paperwork, I only kind of know that it's probably going to be not this coming week, but the next week.
7581863	7582403	So there you go.
7583304	7584825	Fart Princess, do you have any FUs of the week?
7586146	7586566	The Doctor?
7586586	7587187	Somebody?
7587247	7587587	Somebody?
7588815	7592683	I'm the doctor and I'm mad at poop.
7594286	7595188	I'm the doctor.
7595990	7597212	Well, thank you, doctor.
7597332	7598034	The parrot has one.
7598234	7598535	How about...
7599440	7600721	How about the real doctor?
7600901	7602122	Oh, the real doctor.
7602142	7602822	What is the real doctor?
7602882	7606704	My FU's is all the crazy yes on 8 signs in Amador County.
7606844	7608646	Oh, you missed last week.
7608786	7609426	No, you don't even know.
7609446	7610347	It's like a gauntlet.
7610367	7612788	You go through town and there's about 70,000 of them.
7612908	7615550	I already went off on Prop 8 last week.
7615610	7616710	You missed it.
7616770	7619432	So fuck you to everyone in Amador County who's going to vote yes on 8.
7620873	7621733	Protect my rights, bitch.
7621753	7623474	Fuck you to everyone in the state that's going to vote yes on 8.
7623515	7625796	If it makes you feel any better, I already voted and I voted no.
7626236	7626616	Yay.
7626937	7627437	Absentee.
7629313	7630555	Fart Princess, do you have any real FUs?
7632919	7633860	FU to poop.
7635903	7636204	All right.
7637245	7637766	Oh, Ferret.
7637866	7638968	Yes, Ferret would like me to FU.
7639589	7640170	Thank you very much.
7640710	7641672	I agree with you, Ferret.
7642953	7645496	The Ferret is saying to vote no on 8 as well.
7645756	7646277	Exactly.
7646477	7648179	Alright, let's get back into some gaming news.
7649240	7654025	Settlers of Catan, you guys know this game from Xbox Live, or you probably know the original board game, hello.
7655787	7657088	I never played it.
7657368	7663315	Well, it broke down some walls when it came to Xbox Live Arcade, because it was the first, besides Uno, it was the first really in-depth
7663615	7664255	Settlers of Catan
7686171	7690453	And of course, if you don't know what Catan is, it's a game about bartering and trading.
7690473	7695196	It's kind of like Civilization in board game format, except it made no sense to me when I tried to learn how to play it.
7695536	7698117	But I have a limited attention span for these type of things.
7698397	7698577	What?
7698677	7699878	I was more of a Carcassonne fan.
7700138	7700338	What?
7700558	7700979	Exactly.
7701799	7701959	Who?
7702459	7702639	Yep.
7703120	7703480	You got it.
7703600	7704440	What about carcasses?
7705581	7705721	No.
7706021	7706401	Just no.
7707262	7707562	Okay.
7707802	7709983	How about games we do understand?
7710123	7711424	Games where we just shoot and kill things.
7711929	7713251	Well, kind of, sort of.
7713311	7721520	We actually have ratings for the ESRB for stuff to come out on Virtual Console, and that would be Metal Slug 2.
7722962	7726726	You can ride a camel in it, and the camel has a gatling gun.
7727847	7728668	Watch out, they spit.
7729830	7731592	This one spits bullets out of his hip.
7732822	7733342	Awesome.
7733602	7734823	Best camel ever.
7735543	7738964	The other game is A Boy and His Blob.
7738984	7741125	Trouble on Blobolonia.
7741345	7743926	What happened to the DS version that was supposed to come out?
7744486	7745226	Did it ever come out?
7745747	7749828	I don't think it ever did, actually.
7749948	7751208	Maybe the publisher went under, I don't know.
7751228	7752629	Get those jelly beans ready.
7754770	7755410	Jelly beans.
7756450	7757130	That's it.
7757310	7758431	Nobody gets that.
7759381	7759942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7779366	7780827	Wow, that's sadness.
7780867	7781367	Never happened.
7781688	7785130	It didn't really pique my interest anyway when we went to E3 and we saw it.
7785350	7786010	Rob, Rob.
7786130	7786310	What?
7786771	7787811	That makes my heart hurt.
7787892	7788932	I know, it makes my heart hurt too.
7788952	7790093	But we have a new one coming out.
7790493	7791014	Can we?
7791114	7791914	So that's exciting.
7791994	7793035	Well, the virtual console one.
7793055	7793735	I mean, virtual console.
7793775	7794476	Yeah, that's okay.
7795136	7795717	It's not the same.
7795817	7797438	It's the same damn game I've already played.
7798038	7799699	I could just play the Nintendo.
7800320	7804002	Before we get back into some news, I want to take a little detour because you guys got to the show late.
7804022	7808685	You didn't get to talk about your gaming week, but you were telling me, Fart Princess, that there was a game you wanted to talk about.
7809659	7810260	Yes, there is.
7812704	7814606	I've been playing Hello Kitty online.
7816169	7816770	For real?
7816790	7817491	This isn't a joke?
7817831	7819073	No, why would it be a joke?
7820535	7822118	There really is a Hello Kitty online?
7822709	7824871	Rob, I'd appreciate it if you stopped farting.
7824891	7825572	That's really rude.
7825592	7828975	No, you play as a boy or a girl character.
7845469	7846470	I don't remember.
7846850	7847750	I think you do.
7848550	7848811	Okay.
7849131	7850651	I'm pretty sure you have a butt too.
7851172	7857074	You can like... You're interrupting me, Rob.
7857274	7857694	Okay.
7857894	7858414	What?
7859035	7859615	What's so funny?
7860075	7860475	Nothing.
7860515	7862116	Go ahead.
7864597	7865017	Rob!
7865557	7866118	Jeez, Rob.
7866138	7866638	Close your ass.
7866658	7867458	Knock it off.
7867538	7868299	Gaming news.
7868779	7871740	I'm not going to let you talk about Hello Kitty if you don't get to it.
7872145	7872926	Hello, farty.
7877289	7888818	You level in the traditional sense of an MMO, but there's no... You can't kill anything in the game unless you fart on it.
7891179	7895343	The way you level in the game is... Yes, that's totally it.
7895443	7900967	You forage for stuff, like you gather plants and stuff, and then when you eat it, you go...
7901147	7902649	Thanks for watching!
7911107	7912608	Thank you for watching!
7938780	7939461	Stop it, Rob.
7939481	7942827	New from Squeenix, Fatal Fletchlets.
7943288	7945412	Yeah, and that's basically the gist of the game.
7953893	7955094	Look what you did, Rob.
7956155	7957896	You should be ashamed of yourself.
7958196	7962340	Now I'm thinking there actually should be a game called Hello Farty.
7962540	7964181	Alright, stop it.
7964261	7966403	People in the chatroom are complaining about their speakers.
7969505	7971406	They should be complaining about the smell.
7973127	7974887	Can we get on to some gaming?
7975487	7977828	I thought I would actually learn something about Hello Kitty.
7977868	7978849	I told you about it.
7978989	7980049	All about it.
7980069	7980990	You just farted a lot.
7981030	7982710	You didn't even listen.
7982750	7984951	SSJ100Matt says Rob's going to write a hate letter to the show.
7984991	7985491	That is true.
7986592	7986872	Loki.
7987492	7991415	I'm going to make sure that before the podcast goes out, we strip out all the fart noises.
7991515	7992896	But then it wouldn't make sense.
7992916	7993796	There would just be a bunch of giggling.
7993816	7999060	And we're going to patch it for day one release, so that anybody who does obtain the podcast early does not get to hear the fart noises.
7999080	8001241	Every fart noise is going to be replaced with birds chirping.
8002082	8003083	Oh, that'd be great.
8003123	8005584	Then we'd be giggling at birds chirping.
8005604	8006525	We'd need to be farting.
8006565	8007385	Happy little birds.
8007405	8008566	It'd be Hello Birdie.
8009507	8011108	How about Rock Band?
8011570	8012491	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8030270	8030710	Guitar Hero 3
8058146	8061229	No, but they had a demo at the store.
8061450	8062931	Oh, okay, so you haven't really played rock band.
8063832	8065193	You've been in a Best Buy band.
8067496	8072081	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Wii Music, the other type of band game.
8072421	8074824	Wii Music is doing very well in Japan.
8074884	8077727	I know it's been getting a little bit of negative press around the fan.
8078367	8080289	Well, actually, here's what I'm curious about.
8081290	8084293	Doctor, you're a big, giant Nintendo whore.
8084673	8086054	Like, you love everything Nintendo.
8086494	8088556	Now, we're kind of not feeling Wii music.
8088656	8089376	Nope.
8091198	8096042	By Wii, he means himself and Loki.
8096062	8098604	I would like to point out, though, DarkSakura has said she wouldn't pay for it.
8099144	8099344	No.
8099905	8101986	I might have paid for it if I didn't know I was getting one for free.
8102106	8102346	Alright.
8102647	8102907	Anyhow.
8102987	8103027	Um...
8105290	8107312	The Doctor, are you interested in Wii music at all?
8107752	8108533	Why not?
8109094	8110615	Well, you know, and I am the biggest.
8110635	8111676	I'm Nintendo.
8112277	8116721	And I'm just like, I'm kind of bored with these completely novelty games.
8116781	8122726	Like, you know, there's so many cool things that they could do on the Wii, and they're just not.
8123427	8127391	And I'm just like, okay, here's another game where you get to wave the Wii mode around.
8127491	8128352	And I'm just like, eh.
8130762	8131502	Alright, well guess what?
8131522	8134344	The country of Japan disagrees with us and agrees with DarkSakura.
8134864	8143148	According to Famitsu, I'm sorry, according to Famitsu's publisher, InnerBrain, 50,000 units were sold on day one in Japan.
8143668	8146529	So the game is doing huge in Japan and sold a lot.
8147249	8147370	So...
8148590	8152434	Like it or not, it looks like this game will probably have similar success over here.
8152514	8161182	But again, to recap what we've kind of said before on this program, at least myself, if it gets young kids interested in music, it's not a bad thing.
8161222	8164606	But for this old kid, no thank you, I'll pass.
8165487	8166207	More gaming news.
8167386	8168307	Do I gotta?
8168827	8175693	Just one more, then we're gonna open up the Skype line pretty soon at 877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Noms Radio.
8176093	8176834	Nice plug.
8177234	8177534	Thank you.
8177834	8183879	Well, this goes back to a series that was one of the first ones I ever played when the PlayStation first came out.
8184340	8190144	In fact, it was one of the first games that anyone played on the PlayStation when it first came out.
8191005	8192126	It was Toshinden.
8193490	8194912	I love Toshinden, actually.
8195112	8200518	The third one was great because it was awful and had the butt monkey in it and the guy with the chainsaw named David.
8200818	8202060	Everyone loves the butt monkey.
8202240	8203421	He did the butt monkey dance!
8203982	8204302	Okay.
8204843	8206004	Did he spank his butt?
8206084	8208467	No, he was like a baboon and he had like a big red butt.
8208868	8211611	And whenever he went, he would do this little clappy dance.
8211951	8212552	With his butt?
8213112	8213593	With his butt.
8214694	8224076	So anyway, there's actually news in Famitsu that says Takara Tomy is going to be bringing out the Toshinden series on the Wii.
8224756	8227697	So maybe they'll actually make it better?
8229197	8229637	Who knows?
8230257	8231958	Do you get to spank the monkey's butt?
8232498	8233618	But it looks kind of cool.
8234738	8235619	I love Toshinden.
8237259	8242220	You know, I guess retro games making a comeback is nothing new in this current-gen world.
8243106	8245547	I need to go, that just means I need to go find that issue of Fummy 2.
8246408	8248028	Wario Land is pretty good for that.
8249169	8251010	Wario, have you bought the new Wario Land?
8251030	8251830	Yeah, well, yeah.
8251870	8252751	That game is actually really fun.
8252771	8256953	It's very good, and it has really, I mean, it's this great 2D animation, like, it's good.
8258273	8262716	Anyhow, sorry, let's talk about PC games a little bit quickly before we get to some calls.
8262736	8262976	No!
8262996	8263216	Boycott!
8264468	8266431	Well, there's no boycott yet.
8267393	8272781	But Far Cry 2 is going to be bundled with everybody's favorite sport, digital rights management.
8272962	8273442	That's right.
8273903	8277950	You can get Securom technology along with...
8280654	8284136	It will have these restrictions.
8284557	8289059	The purchasers will have up to five activations on three separate PCs.
8290000	8295584	Uninstalling Far Cry 2 refunds an activation, and this process is known as a revoke.
8296184	8301988	As long as you properly uninstall the game, you'll be able to reinstall it an unlimited number of times on three machines.
8302868	8308112	A computer can be upgraded an unlimited number of times using revoke.
8309413	8312996	Ubisoft is willing to provide additional activations if necessary.
8313537	8319482	Ubisoft is committed to a long-term support of their games and you'll always be able to play Far Cry 2.
8321684	8324127	So apparently this is what they're going to start doing from now on.
8324387	8328030	I don't understand why they're still using secure ROM technology since it can be so easily broken.
8328451	8329812	And people just hate it in general.
8329872	8332755	But do people as a whole, do they really seem to care?
8333123	8356558	Well, not according to EA, who says that the small percentage, they're claiming that 99.8% of consumers will never notice the digital rights management that's in the game, which I think is kind of sad that they don't notice that it's in there because it could potentially harm their system, especially when it comes to CD burning software and stuff like that, whatever, that it interrupts.
8358396	8364478	And the fact that these people are unaware that this game is actually causing this problem, that they will go take it in at the cost of money.
8365018	8371179	But either way, it says we can eliminate piracy by essentially blocking the online service from the pirate.
8372019	8374900	It's called the future of digital rights management.
8375320	8381662	Well, that's nice, you know, but some people don't really care about the online portion of your game, and they will still pirate it.
8381982	8385603	In fact, I think there was quite a few copies of Spore that were pirated.
8386403	8400131	and to be honest all they're losing is the online portion of it and if you really don't give a crap about seeing other people's penis monsters then you can still play the game Legend of Zaku in chat says gotta love EA pulling voodoo stats out of their asses is that what this is?
8400751	8412718	I think so I mean I don't know we don't know for sure how many people actually know about it so we have to take their word for it it's not necessarily they're pulling it out of their ass it's just the way they report the numbers that's just politics
8414676	8414936	Anyhow.
8415016	8421540	It's like they think that people that are complaining about it are going to go, Oh, well, okay, so not that many people are complaining about it.
8421640	8422841	I guess I'll just stop complaining.
8423021	8423481	You're right.
8424101	8425022	No, that's not going to happen.
8426786	8427006	All right.
8427466	8430507	Anyhow, one more story, then we're going to get to some calls on the Skype line.
8430707	8432548	And this one has to do with Ghostbusters.
8432568	8435989	You know that game that we hear things about it, then it goes away, then it comes back?
8436030	8442112	Well, people are talking about Ghostbusters again, and it's all thanks to Dan Aykroyd, which, of course, is one of the actors in the original movie.
8442612	8445153	And he was on a Dallas radio station this week, 105.3.
8446313	8450375	And he actually talked to the radio station and actually confirmed...
8450715	8451576	Thanks for watching!
8478587	8481610	Sats crazier than a vaporous full torso apparition.
8484732	8485033	Thanks.
8485233	8487595	That makes me giddy, but we're talking about piss in the chat room.
8488495	8490077	Um, okay.
8490897	8491358	Exactly.
8491658	8495862	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com for an experience that really can't be described.
8496382	8496822	Oh my.
8497843	8501827	It's talking about scientific fact that urine is a sterile solution.
8502762	8504964	Do you ever talk games in the chatroom out of curiosity?
8505204	8505985	Okay, just curious.
8506045	8507126	Do you pee on your video games?
8507226	8509288	Okay, someone brought up peeing in the shower.
8509648	8510309	Oh, God.
8510649	8513932	I was making fun and doing the girly thing.
8514232	8515753	Who wants to stand in their own piss?
8515793	8517034	Blah, blah, blah.
8517054	8519256	1-877-GAME-OLR now is a great time.
8519356	8520237	Just want to point that out.
8520337	8521518	Now is an excellent time.
8522039	8523500	I hope Sigourney Weaver's in the game.
8525334	8526795	Yes, acidic vampire is a very good point.
8526835	8527956	Will Soren Weaver be in the game?
8528016	8531919	And of course, Dark Tetsuya brings up OLR, it's like pissing in an ocean of piss.
8532039	8536542	Will the game be nearly as cool as the Commodore 64 version of Ghostbusters?
8536562	8537102	As long as it has piss.
8537122	8537863	That's what I want to know.
8540004	8540805	Dude, you are red.
8540945	8542726	Porn is better than the original version.
8542886	8549031	I love that the first half of the show was really smart and intelligent, and the second half has been nothing but piss and fart.
8549111	8549211	Pfft.
8550796	8553237	God, this show is just so strange.
8553677	8558318	Maybe our caller... Look, let's go to the phones.
8558358	8558999	We have a caller.
8559039	8562099	Let's see what IQ level they're at tonight.
8562460	8563460	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
8563480	8563840	Who's this?
8564720	8567761	This is Ranma, who is just as immature as everybody else in the studio.
8568041	8569282	Oh, hooray.
8569722	8570782	Ranma, what's on your mind?
8571702	8574543	Not much, but, Ranma, I have a bone to pick with you.
8575043	8576184	Oh, God, what did I do now?
8577364	8580045	I'm offended by how you pronounce people's names.
8581966	8590468	Yeah, you know, I find it pretty offensive, too, that I can't learn to fucking read, especially with all the languages in the world that people derive their names from.
8590508	8600851	I'm very offended that I just don't, like, fucking know because, you know, sometimes you read things one way in one language and they read another way in another, and I'm offended by my lack of edumacation.
8603532	8604813	You know we love you, Rob, right?
8604973	8605653	Yeah, I know.
8606113	8607953	Are you just trying to be a smartass about something?
8608674	8608914	Yes.
8609594	8609974	And what?
8611732	8613612	Talk about the whole little big planet.
8613933	8614633	It's ridiculous.
8614673	8615953	That's all it is.
8616033	8617153	Why do you say ridiculous?
8619754	8626976	Everybody gets offended over something, and the problem is not enough people in this world is open-minded to realize it's nothing to be that serious.
8627376	8628216	That's all it is.
8629036	8634918	I'm just saying, in a way, how Muslims are kind of being subjugated about what's going on in the news and the media.
8634958	8638699	So, of course, something like this they're going to pick up on, and they're going to lose their minds about it.
8639767	8641527	Is that really Sony's fault, though?
8641607	8650869	Because, you know, kind of like I was saying before, is that if Sony doesn't do anything about this, and then the mainstream media picks up on this, I mean, it's going to do a lot of damage.
8651009	8654450	Whereas Sony's trying to put out a fire here before it gets too big.
8656230	8657290	Yeah, but why should they?
8657450	8659971	I mean, it's a normal song.
8660011	8660471	Big deal.
8660631	8662071	Sadly, it's the world we live in.
8662171	8663371	And I'm not saying it's alright.
8663411	8665352	It's just, you know, it's what it is.
8666152	8666452	Yeah.
8668583	8669324	What else is on your mind?
8669344	8671087	Have you been to any cons lately you want to talk about?
8671768	8675974	Yes, I just got back from a convention about six, seven hours ago.
8676054	8677295	You are the con king.
8677396	8678858	What con did you go to this time?
8679696	8680776	I'm a con whore.
8681036	8682517	I went to Zenkai Con.
8682957	8684177	Where is Zenkai Con?
8684858	8687499	Valley Forge Convention Center, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
8687519	8689779	It's where Classic Game Expo was a few years ago.
8690099	8690620	Ah, okay.
8690720	8691600	So how was it?
8692100	8693661	Was there a lot of gaming stuff to be seen there?
8693721	8694641	Was it mostly anime or what?
8695501	8700023	It was a mix of A and B, but wasn't that many video gaming cosplay.
8700043	8702523	But I will say the game room was nice.
8702643	8705104	It was great.
8705404	8707385	Did you get to play anything in the game room you hadn't played before?
8708457	8711060	I've pretty much played the new Bleach game for the Wii.
8711220	8712482	That one I have not played yet.
8714905	8715325	What did you think?
8716306	8717027	I thought it was pretty good.
8717067	8725096	I like the fact that to attack, you actually shake the Wii mode to attack in the game, which is something I've never seen in a Wii game before, really.
8726137	8727599	Yeah, never heard of that one.
8730100	8730360	Which one?
8730400	8731901	Oh yeah, that was a good one.
8758137	8760079	Well, if you got the important one, it was good.
8760099	8760199	Hmm.
8784011	8784671	What system was this?
8784771	8785892	I never played the Ranma.
8786932	8789032	I played a Ranma game on Super Nintendo.
8789052	8792633	There was also one on PC Engine.
8792673	8796514	There's an RPG on PC Engine, which I've played a little bit of.
8796574	8797195	It's kind of hard.
8798015	8802316	And then on PlayStation, there was Ranma 1 Half Battle Renaissance, which I've got, and it's kind of fun.
8802816	8807657	Rice Princess is like Ranma, because if you pour water on her, she goes... Shut up.
8807777	8809538	Did you play Battle Renaissance?
8811045	8811866	Yeah, I played it.
8812706	8815028	I thought the engine was a little bit loose, but it was still fun.
8815268	8816869	Especially when you get to fight in the curse forms.
8817130	8819211	I love actually kicking people's butt as peach on.
8819952	8820512	There you go.
8820972	8821513	Yeah.
8823034	8824935	Alright, well, any other comments before we get to some more calls?
8826296	8830660	Um, one thing you'll probably get a real kick out of, I have pictures up there uploaded soon and sent to you guys.
8830700	8834342	We had a Samba de Amigo dance party at the convention Friday night.
8834703	8835603	Oh, dear good lord.
8835683	8838926	How exactly does one go to a Samba de Amigo dance party?
8840526	8842127	You should put that on YouTube.
8867209	8868370	It probably is.
8868710	8873952	If it's not up now, it should be up by later this week, and I will find images and links to it, and I'll send it to you guys.
8874372	8877173	Alright, Ranma, we've got to let you go, but have a good one, buddy.
8877873	8878694	You too, enjoy.
8878894	8879774	Uh-huh.
8879794	8883976	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
8884936	8886017	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8886037	8886417	Who's this?
8887397	8888978	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio land.
8889018	8894820	It is he who seeks to replace the train wreck of the General Messes with the train wreck of his own choosing.
8895160	8897201	Hello, and you are?
8899461	8900101	Introduce yourself.
8900361	8901642	Bob, Adrian at Hydra.
8903942	8906203	I know who you are, but you have to introduce yourself to the listeners.
8906983	8907383	I'm Jason.
8907643	8908084	Hi, Jason.
8908224	8908944	Alright, what's on your mind?
8909844	8916266	So, since we ever so briefly touched on it, I thought I'd add in a couple little comments since we didn't really go onto it.
8917426	8918746	Two side notes before I do that.
8919086	8921007	Jump Superstars, while it wasn't really in
8921502	8922864	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8939622	8948690	Yeah, I have the first game, and I don't have the second game, I have the first game, and although Quest Mode was awful, awful, awful, I like the song List and Steps of what there was.
8950192	8957799	When I bought my Xbox, I have quite a few other games as well, but my initial reasoning for wanting to buy it was pretty much purely the Ultimate series.
8958459	8958739	Right.
8958779	8959320	They were great.
8959978	8969604	and then E3 came around with the universe redone banners from boring hell and I've just never cared to play the universe series at all.
8970236	8974257	Yeah, but past the banners, it's kind of nice to have the game in high def and widescreen.
8974557	8976357	It's a neat little change for the game.
8976557	8977878	It probably is.
8978018	8978778	I don't doubt that.
8978978	8983099	I mean, Ultramix was never the most visually appealing game in the first place.
8983139	8984879	I don't think anybody's going to deny that.
8985319	8994061	It played really well past the first one, but it never looked... Universe 2 was kind of just like Universe 1 from what I understood, but Universe 3 is supposed to be a lot different.
8994501	8995721	So I'm curious.
8996101	8997161	I'll check it out, probably.
8998402	8999982	Funny, all this from the Bomani
9000686	9001446	The main note.
9001506	9002167	Funny story.
9002227	9005809	Have you guys heard of the there's a sim file that DM Ashura made quite a while ago called Delta Max.
9005829	9006329	Ever heard of it?
9030927	9031227	Yes.
9031287	9031768	Vaguely.
9032428	9034369	I don't know who DM Assure is, but I vaguely know.
9034389	9035930	You know the gimmick, so to say, about it.
9037290	9037870	I don't remember the gimmick.
9037890	9039591	Isn't it that you hit all four notes at once or something?
9040131	9042212	No, and that's an old gimmick, but that's okay.
9043793	9045214	I don't... There's a lot of gimmicks.
9045234	9048675	The gimmick is that it's a DM Assure remix of the Max series.
9049696	9053798	It starts at, I think, 130 beats per minute, and it ends at 573.
9054963	9055343	Is that the one?
9055363	9055984	Oh, okay.
9056704	9058106	Or is it the one that rolls backwards?
9058146	9059467	Because I remember that being a gimmick too.
9059507	9059847	Alright.
9060608	9060868	Go ahead.
9060928	9062769	Okay, so it starts... It's all progression.
9062849	9063510	130 to 573.
9064070	9070255	It's kind of like a BPM per measure, but it speeds up.
9071596	9073458	The speed is not statically increasing.
9073498	9074399	It is very variable.
9074539	9075319	It goes with the tune.
9075379	9076460	It's actually really cool.
9076480	9077181	Okay.
9077588	9085614	There's a Stepmania cabinet that a friend of ours built into the DDR machine down in Colorado Springs that there's a tournament going on at next month.
9085714	9091619	Not that anybody, hey, if you're in the Colorado area, come down to Mr. Bakes next weekend, rather, not next month.
9091639	9092740	There's going to be a lot of cool people there.
9092960	9093280	Ding!
9093320	9094141	That's my plug for the day.
9095782	9104109	So he has a Stepmania cab with all of the official DDR songs, a ton of sim files, Delta Max being one of them, and a couple of other little bonus extras like in the groove.
9106249	9115776	I was very, very disappointed to hear that DeltaMax in Universe 3 isn't going to have the sim-created background video.
9116417	9122842	Because if it did, I could have claimed my own little piece of assistance property in a DDR official game.
9124423	9124583	Why?
9124623	9128026	Did you do something with this?
9128086	9129687	There's a person nicknamed Tora.
9130188	9159362	that I believe he actually did all of the background work basically I don't even remember what the image background is but he created a series of text of all of the beats per minute all the BPM numbers and they have this shaky fluid effect and he put the videos for that together amazingly but what I did was I wrote out a quick little script to actually put in the changes that he wanted to and again it goes up it was a pain in the ass too
9160249	9167234	Just the changes in the videos, the fact that it's not just linear straight up, calculating which measurement and time that it happens on.
9167755	9168455	I barely even remember.
9168475	9169476	That was like three years ago.
9169976	9172038	But it was a very awesome video.
9172058	9173138	It was very simple.
9173259	9174740	But Konami came in and changed it all.
9175380	9177281	Yeah, I don't know what it's going to be, but they changed it.
9177542	9178943	They want to do their own thing, probably.
9179383	9180924	There'll be flowers and sparkles.
9183005	9183686	No, it's universe.
9183726	9186888	It'll be spaceships and Uranus.
9187429	9187749	There'll be...
9190166	9195987	On that note, it'll be a lot of delta triangles flying over the screen because, you know, delta and triangles.
9196527	9198848	Like, oh my god, trigonometry, no!
9198868	9205609	Well, sorry to hear you just missed your chance for remote video game stardom, but hey, you have OLR stardom.
9206069	9207889	Any other things you want to say real quick before we move on?
9209610	9211910	No, I think that was my excuse for calling in tonight.
9212330	9213570	Alright, well, Jason, take care.
9213670	9214291	Thanks for your comments.
9214311	9215171	See ya.
9218193	9218933	We'll take one more call.
9218953	9220894	1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype.
9221014	9222595	Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
9223015	9225436	And then we have some last minute stories to do before we get on out of here.
9225476	9228817	Hey, live listeners, you'll want to stay tuned tonight past the show.
9228837	9230118	We have a little treat for you guys.
9230218	9231318	We'll get into that in a little while.
9231698	9234739	Those of you guys listening on the podcast, though, be sure to join us next week for episode 300.
9234999	9237240	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9237260	9237580	Who's this?
9239561	9240081	It's just me.
9240101	9241522	I hope my call is not screwed up.
9241882	9243483	Well, hello, GS68.
9243503	9244063	What's on your mind?
9245483	9245543	Um...
9251529	9262272	Now that the Mario 3 fan translation is out, I hope that Nintendo takes notice and starts working on an official one.
9262292	9264293	That's a good question, eh?
9278996	9281917	I myself would buy the official thing if it were to come out.
9281977	9288380	In fact, the translators encourage buying the official merchandise and stuff.
9289501	9304367	But as far as the Nintendo side of things, I just hope that if they decide to do something like sue the translators or something like that, that it means that they're working on an official translation and they're not just going to leave it.
9305860	9317626	You know, I think a lot of people are like you, and, you know, if they're real, true fans of the series, they would buy an official translation anyway, but do you think there's some people that would feel so slighted that once they played through the translation, they're just gonna be like, yeah, screw the real one.
9317646	9332192	Yeah, that's a good... That's a good point, like, kind of like when I... Like, I used to download a lot of, like, the money songs, they're, like, buying them, so I was like, nah, screw buying the real thing, I'll just...
9332833	9333293	Keep it.
9333514	9333854	Right.
9334394	9334634	Right.
9335035	9335295	Yeah.
9335455	9336576	Especially with the import stuff.
9337216	9338477	Well, I guess we will see.
9338797	9341959	I'm very curious to see if it does catch the attention of people in Nintendo.
9341999	9344381	I'm waiting for the cease and desist myself, but we'll see.
9345362	9346903	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, GS68?
9347063	9347243	Yeah.
9349485	9350686	Sky, you went to Milpitas Golf Land.
9350886	9352827	Damn, we need to come down to Sunnyvale Golf Land again.
9353948	9354648	You know, I know.
9354748	9355889	I knew I was in the area.
9356290	9359192	It worked out so that we were at Milpitas, and I didn't make it over there.
9359232	9361553	But I'll get to Sunnyvale at some point, I'm sure.
9361853	9362254	Yeah, maybe...
9363484	9365985	NorCal Division of the All-Army can meet up there.
9366345	9367226	We'll see, we'll see.
9367286	9371827	You know, with the surgery coming up and everything, it won't be anytime soon, but who knows, maybe by the end of the year.
9373368	9378250	Yeah, I was saying, maybe we should be going to Svega lately for Poppin' 16.
9379010	9380231	Ooh, hey, I like poppin' music.
9380711	9382131	It's certainly better than Beatin' Groovy.
9383972	9385593	Yeah, I've gotten back into it recently.
9386348	9387388	Yeah, it's fun.
9387428	9388769	I might get a job.
9390390	9397172	I'm possibly getting a job where I might use the money to get a desktop arcade so I can play the real thing at home instead of freaking 9K 2DX.
9398953	9400294	Good times, good times.
9401254	9409977	I wish I... Of course, then again, I'm like, I wish I had that kind of disposable income, but then again, I'm looking at my new iPhone when I'm saying that.
9410418	9411378	We all have priorities.
9411678	9413699	Alright, GS6 here, we gotta let you go, but have a good one, buddy.
9414540	9415080	You too.
9439031	9440872	Loki, you always have something for Last Minute Stories.
9441132	9442653	Yeah, a few more things real quick.
9443194	9449118	We know that Guitar Hero, they're talking about making God knows how many games next year for it.
9449218	9452320	Well, there's yet another one that's been discovered.
9452920	9458644	A trademark has recently been placed for the title Guitar Hero Modern Hits.
9459705	9464648	And no word on exactly what that is, but... Of course, the term hit is relative.
9465069	9465649	Exactly.
9466009	9466169	It's...
9468482	9468842	Who knows?
9469222	9471484	If I were to take a guess, I think it's another DS version.
9471944	9473465	It sounds like a DS version to me.
9473745	9474345	That's a good point.
9474525	9474806	Probably is.
9474826	9475466	It's pretty vague.
9477547	9477847	Alright.
9478388	9488633	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to Xbox Live Marketplace as an Xbox original starting, well, actually this Monday, October 20th.
9489054	9494217	So you'll be able to download the full game for $15 or 1,200 Microsoft points.
9494677	9495337	So that's pretty cool.
9496318	9496418	Um...
9497552	9498653	Also, Fable 2.
9499893	9502995	You should definitely go to Microsoft's website.
9503015	9504957	They have a special website made for Fable 2.
9505997	9506958	Xbox.com.
9507238	9509019	I believe you just go to the Fable 2 page.
9509940	9513502	They have a little game that you can play, including Chicken Kickin'.
9514222	9518545	And you can actually win prizes for your in-game character.
9518985	9522967	So you can win gold and different prizes in Fable 2.
9523868	9524548	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9549963	9552424	Yeah, so interesting.
9552504	9553865	Area 51, the movie.
9554445	9556486	Hopefully it's cheesy and motion captured.
9558567	9566170	Then there's going to be some new download content for Mega Man 9 coming soon, including a brand new bonus level with a bonus boss, Fake Man.
9567751	9571392	And you'll be able to purchase that for 100 Wii Points.
9571552	9573073	Will it not be impossibly hard?
9574134	9574654	Probably not.
9575834	9577354	but it's a brand new special stage.
9577494	9580275	Oh my god, I can't play that game.
9580675	9588196	And lastly, to kind of talk a little bit about another game that we'll be seeing a little bit more pretty soon, LittleBigPlanet.
9588216	9590196	They actually have some more videos from the beta.
9590236	9595897	Someone has actually recreated some of the levels from Mirror's Edge in this game.
9596157	9605579	So you can actually play some of the Mirror's Edge levels in the beta and of course the full game when it comes out because all those levels are being transferred over which is pretty freaking awesome.
9607577	9607977	That's it.
9609479	9615743	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, but before we finish the show tonight, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9617245	9621128	Fart Princess, thank you for coming to the show when you did and everything.
9621148	9623630	Do you have a final thought for us, even though you were late?
9624230	9625591	Vote no on Poop 8.
9626532	9626972	Thank you.
9628353	9629935	The Doctor, do you have any final thoughts?
9636434	9638394	We're getting a little political tonight.
9640255	9641915	Loki, do you have a final thought?
9642875	9648637	My costume is freaking awesome and you may see it next week.
9649357	9650197	Is it Tingle?
9651917	9653098	It's a video game character.
9655698	9658679	My final thought is Mentos.
9659119	9659959	Fresh and full of life.
9660819	9661880	DarkSakura, your final thought.
9662060	9663660	I fucking love Ichiban Khan.
9666366	9670609	IchibanConUSA.com I shop there every time I'm in San Francisco.
9671790	9672851	Sounds good.
9673652	9676935	Next week, episode 300 of Orange Lounge Radio.
9676995	9679377	What guests and surprises await the crew?
9680498	9683881	What messages will you guys leave for us on our Skype line when we're not live?
9684061	9685502	Will it potentially be a fuck show?
9685983	9686423	Who knows?
9686903	9689225	All that to be determined in one week's time.
9690206	9693908	Come back for episode 300 of Orange Lounge Radio next week.
9693928	9697549	Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard tonight, tell two friends about the show.
9697569	9698449	That's how we spread the word.
9698470	9705973	And if you don't have any friends, just kidding, even if you do, you should post a review on our iTunes on the store.
9706033	9707933	And I'll post the link in chat for our live listeners.
9708013	9712735	If you're not listening live, you should go search for it in iTunes and leave us a nice five-star review.
9712855	9714116	Yes, every little bit helps.
9714756	9716237	The more listeners we have, the better.
9716297	9718518	Because it's not about awards.
9719502	9720362	It's about listeners.
9720783	9722423	About you guys that show up every week.
9722463	9723344	So thank you guys so much.
9724004	9724424	Have a good one.
9724444	9726025	We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9742933	9745437	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
