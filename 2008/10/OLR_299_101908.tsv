0	2000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
7000	12000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Loco
13000	16000	Tonight, October 19th, 2008
16000	18000	LittleBigPlanet generates some big controversy
18000	22000	Download content comes to SoulCalibur 4 that will surprise no one
22000	25000	And could Marvel vs. Capcom 2 soon be re-released?
25000	29000	Orange, Lounge, Radio
56000	58000	I'm sorry to hear that
58000	60000	I guess we'll have some good rants tonight
62000	64000	Careful Chat
65000	67000	I didn't do it, did I?
67000	69000	You love me, right?
69000	71000	It's groups of people
71000	75000	Maybe we'll catch on a little bit about what's going on later
75000	77000	If I don't feel better about it by then
77000	79000	Alright, we'll see
79000	81000	Also, say hello to the one and only Loki
81000	82000	Hello
82000	83000	How are you, Techmaster? Loki?
83000	84000	I'm fine
84000	85000	Are you having a good week?
85000	86000	Yes
86000	88000	Are you mad at certain groups of people too?
88000	90000	Maybe
90000	92000	You're perpetually mad at somebody
92000	93000	No, I'm just kidding
93000	94000	Alright, I feel fine
94000	95000	I'm having a good week
95000	96000	I'm not really mad at anybody
96000	97000	Well, I guess that's a lie
97000	98000	I'm mad at some people
98000	100000	But I look past it
100000	101000	For the sake of the show
101000	103000	Where we talk about just the games
103000	105000	And kick them back and have a little bit of fun
105000	107000	And in order to talk about the games
107000	109000	We gotta talk about our gaming weeks
109000	111000	And what we've been doing lately
111000	112000	If you want to join us
112000	114000	chat.orangelandradio.com
114000	116000	Is where we are reading comments from you guys
116000	118000	In our chat room
118000	119000	On this lovely Sunday evening
119000	121000	As we always do when we tape live
121000	122000	Alright, let's start off
122000	123000	DarkSakura
123000	124000	How was your gaming week?
124000	126000	I played Rock Band 2 and Ragnarok Online
126000	128000	How was Rock Band 2?
128000	129000	It was very good
129000	130000	Yeah?
130000	134000	What is your instrument of preference in Rock Band 2?
134000	136000	I don't have one
136000	138000	You like to play a little bit of everything?
138000	140000	I really don't prefer to play
140000	141000	Oh, you like to watch?
141000	142000	No, my shoulder hurt
142000	143000	And I was in a lot of pain
143000	145000	So they made me play bass on a song
145000	146000	Gotcha
146000	148000	Alright, well, hey
148000	151000	How did you like it compared to the first one?
151000	153000	I saw no difference
153000	155000	It's more Rock Band
155000	156000	Yeah, more
156000	157000	Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, right?
157000	159000	More songs, I mean, that was okay
159000	161000	But, you know, I wasn't
161000	163000	It wasn't anything to be impressed or
163000	165000	Displeased over
165000	166000	It was just more Rock Band
166000	167000	Alright
167000	168000	Well, if there's nothing else
168000	169000	Then we'll move on to Loki
169000	170000	How was your gaming week?
170000	171000	Hi
171000	173000	Oh, the clothes in it suck
175000	177000	Better Barbie mode in the first game
177000	179000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
179000	181000	Well, they actually still have some of the same
181000	183000	Clothes from the first game and the second game
183000	185000	Didn't really add that much
185000	187000	The GWAR outfits were kind of neat
189000	191000	Let's see, this week I played
191000	193000	Singing Zero 2, actually
193000	195000	I'm thinking about
196000	198000	Almost 50% done with the game
198000	200000	It says I'm only like 37%
200000	202000	Or maybe it's 47% done
204000	206000	Basically, I've gone through two of the gangs already
206000	209000	I've finished the Brotherhood and the Son of Samedi
209000	211000	And
211000	213000	That was a weird gang
213000	216000	And then finally now I'm starting to run in a little bit
216000	218000	And
218000	219000	I don't know, it's pretty cool
219000	221000	I still think, though, out of the three gangs so far
221000	223000	The Brotherhood have been
223000	226000	I think that storyline was the most brutal that was in it
226000	228000	Played a little bit of the multiplayer
228000	230000	And they actually have a game mode
230000	231000	That's pretty awesome
231000	233000	It kind of mixes up
233000	235000	Different modes of the single player game
235000	238000	Some of the activities it can do with multiplayer
238000	240000	So basically it's team based
240000	242000	You start off and you have about a minute
242000	244000	That's just pure deathmatch
244000	246000	And then an activity will start
246000	249000	So the first game I played, there was a mayhem activity
249000	251000	So basically
251000	253000	You have to go and destroy as many things as possible
253000	257000	Just the environment, cars, other people, etc.
257000	259000	And so we did that
259000	262000	And then after about, say, five minutes or so
262000	264000	The activity stops
264000	266000	And then there's a break in between it
266000	268000	Like another minute where it's just a deathmatch
268000	271000	And then a new activity will start
271000	274000	And then the new activity, I think, was insurance fraud
274000	276000	So we had to throw ourselves in front of cars and stuff like that
276000	279000	Or you can hit your own teammates and you get points for that
279000	281000	But all along, while this is going on
281000	285000	There's also different tags you can spray paint
285000	287000	To give your teams different abilities
287000	293000	Like double damage or double money for killing other gang members
293000	297000	Or a smokescreen, stuff like that
297000	300000	So really cool gameplay
300000	303000	The actual deathmatch mode's pretty fun
303000	305000	Doing some of that
305000	307000	I like the shopping mall level that they have
307000	309000	That's kind of fun to play around in
309000	313000	And then, what else did I play?
313000	315000	I got a random off-the-wall question for you about Saints Row 2
315000	318000	I know we have a news story coming up later on
318000	320000	About some of the controversy this game is generating
320000	322000	Which game do you think is more violent
322000	324000	And has more potential for controversy?
324000	326000	This game or Grand Theft Auto?
326000	329000	Seeing as they're very similar and appeal to the same audience
329000	331000	Maybe this game a little bit
331000	333000	Because they don't really get into
333000	335000	I mean, there's corrupt police in Grand Theft Auto 4
335000	339000	In this game you can actually dress up or impersonate a cop
339000	342000	In this fictional cops type show
342000	346000	Called, I forget what it's called now
346000	349000	But it's, oh, The Fuzz
349000	351000	That's what the show's called
351000	353000	And you basically go around beating up
353000	354000	Like Hot Fuzz?
354000	355000	Yes
355000	357000	You go around beating up people dressed up as cops
357000	359000	While they're filming it and stuff
359000	361000	And it's one of the activities
361000	365000	Unless there's a level where you break into a police station
365000	367000	Do a bunch of stuff like that
367000	370000	If anything, I'd say Grand Theft Auto San Andreas
370000	372000	I think was more
372000	375000	Kind of showing cops in a bad light
375000	377000	But both games, I mean, the kill count
377000	379000	As far as police officers go
379000	381000	Is going to be pretty high
381000	383000	I would think if anything Grand Theft Auto
383000	385000	Might be a little bit higher just because
385000	387000	You don't really have gang members chasing after you
387000	390000	In Grand Theft Auto, it's mainly just the police
390000	392000	Whereas in Saints Row, you have gang members
392000	394000	And the police chasing after you
394000	397000	So, you know, just out of sheer numbers
397000	399000	I think Grand Theft Auto 4, probably the percentage
399000	401000	Of police officers killed would be a lot larger
401000	403000	You know, I'm somehow not surprised by that answer
403000	405000	Because I would think if I'm the designers
405000	406000	Behind Saints Row 2
406000	408000	And I want to kind of break through that
408000	410000	You know, ceiling that Grand Theft Auto
410000	412000	Has kind of put out there where, you know, Grand Theft Auto
412000	415000	Is the creme de la creme of these sandbox games
415000	417000	You know, it's by far and wide the most popular
417000	419000	I'm not surprised if I'm the developers of Saints Row 2
419000	421000	And the people behind this game
421000	423000	I know one of the best ways I'm going to get at
423000	425000	And get close to that number is to one up
425000	427000	The controversy they're doing
427000	429000	Because that's half the reason why Grand Theft Auto sells
429000	431000	God, people need to understand
431000	433000	It's fiction, it's not like
433000	435000	I go and go shoot the cops in the game
435000	437000	Because I wish I could go shoot real cops
437000	439000	I mean, that's not what happens
439000	441000	It's just the opposition
441000	443000	It could be Nazis running this entire city
443000	445000	And it doesn't matter
445000	447000	If, you know, they're still coming after you
447000	449000	Well, it's funny
449000	451000	That you mention that, you know, this might seem completely random
451000	453000	But it is related, you know, I was at the movies
453000	455000	The other day and they were showing that little
455000	457000	What's that thing they do before? Like, you know how they play commercials
457000	459000	Like 20 minutes while people walk in
459000	461000	Okay, whatever it's called, the 20
461000	463000	Well, I was only like half watching and I was kind of distracted
463000	465000	Talking to somebody else and I look at the screen and go
465000	467000	Oh, what's this movie? This looks neat
467000	469000	And then, like, I saw some guy that looked like they were on fire
469000	471000	And I'm like, wow, I'm kind of surprised I can show that in a trailer
471000	473000	It was Fable 2
473000	475000	Like, I thought it was like an actual movie coming out
475000	477000	But it was a Fable 2 commercial
477000	479000	Yeah
479000	481000	I mean, games are getting...
481000	483000	They've come a long way since combat, let's put it that way
483000	485000	But, yeah, I mean, it's just if
485000	487000	Yeah, if you want to look at it like it's realistic
487000	489000	Or something like that, then yeah, okay, sure
489000	491000	I guess it's offensive to cops or something
491000	493000	But you have to understand, games aren't meant to be
493000	495000	A simulation for real life
495000	497000	I mean, granted, you can make a game that's like
497000	499000	A simulation of real life
499000	501000	If you want, but then again, you can also make
501000	503000	Pure fiction that's just way over the top
503000	505000	Which is what Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto are doing
505000	507000	You know, to an extent
507000	509000	And Grand Theft Auto is a little bit more grounded
509000	511000	But still, it's pretty over the top
511000	513000	I don't know
513000	515000	It's just
515000	517000	You can find controversy anywhere
517000	521000	And then, the other game I've played
521000	525000	Which also has controversy, I guess, involved with it
525000	527000	Would be Little Big Planet
527000	529000	And Little Big Planet is amazing
529000	531000	That's easy to say
531000	533000	I mean, it's just an amazing game
533000	535000	The fact, from the very beginning of the game
535000	537000	Even through the title credits sequence
537000	539000	Which I might add is all in-game engine
539000	541000	It's just incredible
541000	543000	It's just all of the stuff that was actually
543000	545000	In the game was made with the creator
545000	547000	In the game
547000	549000	So, you know, just going through
549000	551000	Each of the levels of stuff in there
551000	553000	They kind of have a basic tutorial
553000	555000	To walk you through of how to play the game
555000	557000	As time goes on
557000	559000	And then
559000	561000	Each level, they actually have a storyline
561000	563000	That continues on
563000	565000	And it's really, really cool
565000	567000	Mildly offensive, but really, really cool
567000	569000	I think some of the levels are
569000	571000	As we were talking about during the break
571000	573000	They're characters of
573000	575000	Different sections of the world
575000	577000	So, like, the African level
577000	579000	Is all like
579000	581000	Think Lion King, basically
581000	583000	Whereas the
583000	585000	British level
585000	587000	Is the
587000	589000	British levels
589000	591000	Are all knights in castles
591000	593000	And that kind of thing
593000	595000	So it's a little bit racist
595000	597000	But in the way that it's a small world
597000	599000	Is racist, where no one's gonna possibly be offended
599000	601000	Because it's so damn cute
601000	603000	It's incredibly cute
603000	605000	It's incredibly cute
605000	607000	Now, my thing with Sony, if they were smart
607000	609000	This sucker would be
609000	611000	In the next bundle that they're doing
611000	613000	This would be a bundle that's out
613000	615000	This holiday
615000	617000	They need to be bundling this game with the system
617000	619000	Because I'm telling you, this game will sell systems
619000	621000	Easy. You just get this out
621000	623000	People are gonna look at this and they're like
623000	625000	Oh my god, you know, that's just an amazing game
625000	627000	It's way more amazing than Wii Sports
627000	629000	And I think it's gonna appeal to everybody
629000	631000	Game of the year?
631000	633000	It could definitely be a contender
633000	635000	For game of the year
635000	637000	Anything else in your gaming week this week?
637000	639000	Umm
639000	641000	No.
641000	643000	I hate to take it back to Saints Row because you talk about that game an awful lot
643000	645000	But, a good question from chatroom
645000	647000	At chat.orangesonsrady.com
647000	649000	First chat comment of the night goes to C-more Booty
649000	651000	Since you guys are talking about Saints Row 2
651000	653000	Are you having any problems with crashing or freezing
653000	655000	In the game? It crashes my system every time
655000	657000	I try to save manually
657000	659000	Umm, not really
659000	661000	I've had it lock up a few times
661000	663000	But it's just random
663000	665000	I mean, it's just like any other game
665000	667000	It's...
667000	669000	You know, I haven't really had any problems saving manually
669000	671000	Because I do it all the time
671000	673000	I want to quit or something
673000	675000	At that time
675000	677000	No, not really any problems with it
677000	679000	Alright
679000	681000	My gaming week, not a lot of new stuff this week
681000	683000	Sadly, I'm sorry to disappoint
683000	685000	But I've had a lot going on in my personal life
685000	687000	But I will say this, the new WoW 3.0 patch came out this week
687000	689000	Of course WoW being World of Warcraft
689000	691000	Had a huge content upgrade this week
691000	693000	And you guys know I'm the resident Warcraft addict
693000	695000	On staff here
695000	697000	Just having a lot of fun with that
697000	699000	There's been a lot of new things added into the game
699000	701000	With regards to talents
701000	703000	I don't know how much I mentioned this on the show
703000	705000	But I play a balanced druid as my main character
705000	707000	And so our class really got a lot of love
707000	709000	We have some new talents that are just awesome
709000	711000	I was using Starfall and PvP today and it's great
711000	713000	And one of my favorite new talents is something called Typhoon
713000	715000	Where when you click it, it's like this big blue sploosh
715000	717000	That goes across the screen and everybody gets knocked back
717000	719000	So it's kind of awesome to use
719000	721000	That and PvP around the world
721000	723000	So, achievements as well have finally
723000	725000	Come to World of Warcraft and a lot of time
725000	727000	Kind of spent getting the achievements and new titles
727000	729000	To come with them
729000	731000	One of the first things my guild did as soon as the patch went live
731000	733000	Probably about an hour of the patch going live
733000	735000	We went back to Ubers and the old WoW content
735000	737000	And got ourselves the Jenkins title
737000	739000	Because you can now, you know
739000	741000	WoW has this funny way of working in pop culture references
741000	743000	About WoW into WoW
743000	745000	And this whole Leroy Jenkins thing
745000	747000	Is now Leroy is an achievement
747000	749000	And if you get that achievement you can have Jenkins as your title
749000	751000	So that you're like, you know, if your character name is
751000	753000	Sky
753000	755000	You would be Sky Jenkins
755000	757000	Which is kind of funny
757000	759000	So there you go
759000	761000	Other than Warcraft and experiencing the new patch
761000	763000	I actually, I took a trip
763000	765000	And you folks that have been listening to the show for a long time
765000	767000	Since we were about music games will appreciate this
767000	769000	And you guys here in studio
769000	771000	I went to Milpitas Golf Land this week
771000	773000	I went to good old Miggle
773000	775000	It's changed a lot
775000	777000	Since, you know, I hadn't been there in quite a few years
777000	779000	Last time I was there I think they still had Derby Owners Club
779000	781000	Which is now at our Miggle
781000	783000	And at Milpitas Golf Land
783000	785000	You know, you have to remember
785000	787000	This is like the holy land of
787000	789000	BeatMania and the Bobani
789000	791000	Between Milpitas and Sunnyvale Golf Land
791000	793000	You know, these were
793000	795000	I guess you could say Arcade Infinity to an extent
795000	797000	It was like the trinity of California
797000	799000	Northern California
799000	801000	Well, Arcade Infinity is southern technically
801000	803000	You know what I mean though
803000	805000	It's like one of the west coast hubs
805000	807000	Of where DDR got big
807000	809000	And it's interesting to see, you know how
809000	811000	Milpitas
811000	813000	Used to have DDR in one of the rooms
813000	815000	That room, it's like two rooms
815000	817000	This arcade is like two separate buildings
817000	819000	One building now is nothing but ticket games
819000	821000	Like I remember when we were first
821000	823000	Going there, like half of it was ticket redemption
823000	825000	It was slowly spreading, well now it is
825000	827000	Nothing but ticket redemption in one room
827000	829000	But it's interesting because they've turned the other room into
829000	831000	You know, like all the music
831000	833000	Games are on one wall
833000	835000	Then all the driving games are over here
835000	837000	And all the fighting games are over here
837000	839000	So it's kind of like you have just different little sections
839000	841000	It was kind of interesting, but I did play
841000	843000	I played Midnight Maximum Tune 3
843000	845000	And I played Keyboard Mania
845000	847000	Even though it was sticking on the keyboard
847000	849000	But a new game I played, Dance Dance Revolution
849000	851000	Supernova 2, it's been out this whole time
851000	853000	And I have not yet played it in arcades
853000	855000	And it was really the same damn thing as the last game
855000	857000	There wasn't much difference
857000	859000	Just some new songs, yippee
859000	861000	And some little flashy graphics when you get combos
861000	863000	Forgot to let you know
863000	865000	This is totally local news
865000	867000	Remember that one store that we went to
867000	869000	That's right there by the Folsom Theater
869000	871000	The Gamer's Empire, whatever
871000	873000	They got a Supernova machine now
873000	875000	Oh, nice
875000	877000	It's untouched, you know, basically
877000	879000	Nice, well this is the other thing that surprised me
879000	881000	Miggle is selling their DDR Extreme machine
881000	883000	They have a little sign on it that says
883000	885000	For Sale, guess how much they want for this
885000	887000	Miggle machine, DDR Extreme machine
887000	889000	As is
889000	891000	$12,000
891000	893000	No, a little high, very high in fact
893000	895000	It's a used machine, no much higher
895000	897000	$8,000
897000	899000	A little lower
899000	901000	$7,000
901000	903000	$6,000 is what they want for this machine
903000	905000	$5,999 to be exact
905000	907000	If you can take the machine, retrofit it
907000	909000	And upgrade it, I mean
909000	911000	That's always interesting
911000	913000	So that was it, and then I actually played miniature golf
913000	915000	Which in all the times I've ever been to Milpitas Golf Line
915000	917000	I never have played miniature golf there
917000	919000	But I did this time
919000	921000	So there you go
921000	923000	Miniature golf, the real game
923000	925000	That's it, not a lot of whole other console games I've been playing
925000	927000	Just, you know, experiencing wow this week
927000	929000	And, you know, some of the same old console stuff I've been playing
929000	931000	Like Rock Band and all that, good stuff
931000	934000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping real quick
934000	936000	It is episode number 299 tonight
936000	939000	Which means next week is episode number 300
939000	941000	If you can believe it
941000	943000	And what we want you guys to do is
943000	945000	We want you to leave your messages for us
945000	947000	We're going to play them during next week's commercial break
947000	949000	If you want to say a few words about Orange Launch Radio
949000	951000	Just try to keep it a minute or less
951000	953000	You can call the Skype line anytime when we're not live
953000	955000	Don't call right now if you're listening live on Sunday night
955000	957000	But if you're listening to this in the podcast format
957000	961000	Give 1-877-GAME-OLR a call
961000	963000	And leave us a message about
963000	965000	What you think about us making episode 300
965000	967000	And we'll play it on the break next week
967000	969000	Otherwise, it's going to be a good old fashioned show
969000	971000	You never know what kind of guest might show up
971000	973000	Also, we have some games planned for next week
973000	975000	It'll be a good time, there you have it
975000	977000	Yeah, and something that
977000	979000	Loki has a huge surprise, we'll say that
979000	981000	We'll say that much, Loki has a huge surprise
981000	985000	And let's see, what else do we have coming up?
985000	987000	If you've been listening to the show this year
987000	989000	You know I've had some medical issues going on
989000	991000	I'm going to be having surgery right after episode 300
991000	995000	So we probably won't be having a show the next week
995000	997000	So we might have a little bit of a break after episode 300
997000	999000	We'll have more details on that next week, that's all
999000	1001000	So we'll talk about that
1001000	1003000	And don't worry, the surgery is nothing major
1003000	1005000	It's gallbladder surgery, a million people have had it done
1005000	1007000	I'm not that worried about it
1007000	1009000	I just kind of want to get it over with at this point
1009000	1011000	So, that's it for housekeeping
1011000	1013000	Visit our MySpace, visit our Facebook
1013000	1015000	Visit our live journal, our Twitter
1015000	1017000	Let's get into tonight's gaming news
1017000	1019000	Loki, start us off
1019000	1021000	Yes, anyways
1021000	1025000	So, this is kind of interesting
1025000	1029000	Not too surprising because they haven't been doing well financially for a while now
1029000	1035000	But Infogrames has finally now finished purchasing Atari
1035000	1041000	They made an $11 million stock purchase of Atari
1041000	1047000	And previously they had owned 51.4%
1047000	1051000	But now they are done with the purchase
1051000	1053000	And we'll see where they take it
1053000	1057000	Hopefully in the right direction
1057000	1061000	And not, I don't know, into the red again
1061000	1065000	This is the same company that brought us the Epic 2600
1065000	1067000	And my how times have changed, right?
1067000	1069000	This is kind of, I don't know, kind of sad in a way
1069000	1071000	But you kind of saw it coming
1071000	1073000	Because what has Atari done in the past five years
1073000	1075000	That's been really huge
1075000	1077000	Besides maybe their flashback consoles
1077000	1079000	Which are really cool, actually
1079000	1081000	Dragon Ball Z
1081000	1083000	I guess, alright
1083000	1085000	But, I don't know, in a way it's kind of the end of an era
1085000	1087000	Did I say error?
1087000	1089000	No, I'm thinking of something else
1089000	1091000	The end of an era, you know what I mean?
1091000	1095000	So, it's kind of sad, but there you go
1095000	1099000	Hey, LittleBigPlanet has been stirring up a lot of talk this week
1099000	1101000	And one thing that's got people talking about LittleBigPlanet
1101000	1105000	Is the new license agreement that Sony has
1105000	1109000	Sony actually recently changed the PlayStation Network terms of use
1109000	1111000	And basically to make a long story short
1111000	1113000	Long story short
1113000	1115000	Sony says now in the user license agreement
1115000	1119000	You also authorize us and our affiliated companies without payment to you
1119000	1123000	To license, sell, and otherwise commercially exploit your user material
1123000	1125000	So if you don't like it, don't use it
1125000	1127000	If you create a LittleBigPlanet level in the game
1127000	1130000	And Sony decides they're going to sell it on a compilation later on
1130000	1134000	Like maybe a best of for people that don't have online access
1134000	1138000	As I could possibly see forthcoming depending on how big this game is
1138000	1140000	Too bad you're not getting any money for it
1140000	1142000	And if you don't like it, don't play the game
1142000	1146000	You know, I like how they actually have exploit in there
1146000	1148000	An interesting word
1148000	1150000	I will rape your mother!
1150000	1152000	What? I don't know
1152000	1154000	I don't think that'll be a LittleBigPlanet level
1154000	1156000	Could be
1156000	1158000	It's kind of not surprising
1158000	1160000	I know a lot of people are looking at this as a
1160000	1163000	Oh my gosh, Sony is so big, bad, and evil corporate
1163000	1165000	But is it really that surprising in a way?
1165000	1166000	No
1166000	1167000	Not really
1167000	1169000	I would hope that they still give you credit for it at least
1169000	1172000	Or say, hey, you know, it's going to be in here
1172000	1175000	At least send you a free copy of the game, shit
1175000	1177000	That's the least they could do
1177000	1179000	I mean a lot of people would probably be like, hell yeah, go ahead and put it in there
1179000	1181000	I mean, I don't think they
1181000	1183000	I don't know, I would be like
1183000	1185000	Hell yeah, go ahead and put that in there, just give me credit
1185000	1188000	But if you don't like it, you don't like it, don't use it
1188000	1190000	Don't play the game
1190000	1192000	I guess, I mean
1192000	1196000	I don't know, if you were really expecting to profit off LittleBigPlanet
1196000	1198000	I think you might be playing the game for the wrong reasons, right?
1198000	1200000	Yeah
1200000	1202000	I don't know
1202000	1208000	Anyhow, we'll see how Sony plans to exploit user-created levels pretty soon
1208000	1210000	Well, moving on to
1210000	1212000	I don't know if this
1212000	1214000	Well, exploitation just really isn't the best word for this
1214000	1216000	I call it hypocrisy
1216000	1218000	But, you know, as we discussed with Bobby earlier
1218000	1220000	Speaking of which
1222000	1224000	This is
1224000	1226000	LittleBigPlanet is being recalled
1226000	1230000	Because of religious content within the game
1230000	1232000	And technically, what it is
1232000	1234000	Is two expressions from the Quran
1234000	1240000	Have made it into the game by means of a song that was licensed to be in the game
1240000	1243000	That came out a few years ago
1243000	1247000	And one person in the beta found it
1247000	1250000	And apparently took offense to its presence
1250000	1254000	And therefore wrote a letter to Sony
1254000	1256000	Which I have right here
1256000	1259000	Because I love pulling up, you know
1259000	1265000	Archived content off of message boards after posts have been deleted for days
1265000	1271000	And I'm not even going to bother pronouncing any of the Arabic
1271000	1273000	Because I can't
1273000	1275000	We'll play the clip in a little bit
1275000	1278000	Well, this is to Sony Computer Entertainment and Media Molecule
1278000	1280000	While playing your latest game LittleBigPlanet
1280000	1285000	In the first level of the third world in the game titled Swinging Safari Smiley Wink
1285000	1291000	I've noticed something strange in the lyrics of the music track of the level
1291000	1293000	When I listened carefully
1293000	1294000	I hit the fair by accident
1294000	1295000	When I listened carefully
1295000	1298000	I was surprised to hear some very familiar Arabic words from the Quran
1298000	1300000	You can listen to the track here
1300000	1301000	We'll play it in a second
1301000	1303000	The words are in the 18th second
1303000	1305000	It's to translate
1305000	1307000	Every soul shall have the taste of death
1307000	1309000	And to almost immediately after in the 27th second
1309000	1311000	All that is on earth will perish
1311000	1314000	I asked many of my friends online and offline
1314000	1317000	And they had heard the exact same thing I heard easily
1317000	1319000	When I played that part of the track
1319000	1322000	Certain Arabic hardcore gaming forums are already discussing this
1322000	1326000	So we decided to take action by emailing you before this spreads to mainstream attention
1326000	1328000	TOO LATE
1328000	1334000	We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our holy Quran deeply offending
1334000	1338000	We hope you would remove the track from the game immediately via an online patch
1338000	1342000	And make sure that all future shipments of the game do not contain it
1342000	1346000	We'd also like to mention this isn't the first time something like this has happened in video games
1346000	1352000	Nintendo's 1998 hit Zelda Ocarina of Time contained a musical track with Islamic phrases
1352000	1357000	And was removed in later shipments of the game after Nintendo was contacted by Muslim organizations
1357000	1360000	Last year Capcom, Zach and Wiki and Activision's Call of Duty 4
1360000	1365000	Also contained objectionable material offensive to Muslims that was spotted before the release of the final games
1365000	1368000	And both companies thankfully removed the content
1368000	1373000	We hope that you act immediately to avoid any confusion and necessary controversy
1373000	1376000	And we thank you for making such an amazing game
1376000	1378000	Now I think the letter was very well worded
1378000	1384000	However, I'm going to go back and read a particular line from this, if I may
1384000	1389000	We Muslims consider the mixing of music and words from our holy Quran deeply offending
1389000	1394000	So why aren't you offended at the artist that, you know, recorded the song in the first place?
1394000	1399000	Don't you think that's just a little bit of hypocrisy right there?
1399000	1406000	I mean, shouldn't you actually take issue up with the songwriter who, by the way, is Muslim, right?
1406000	1410000	Yeah, and the song has been out since 2006
1410000	1414000	Exactly, so why don't you do your homework first?
1414000	1418000	Okay, and to be honest, I mean, who is this really offending?
1418000	1421000	It's not like, you know, death to America, woohoo!
1421000	1424000	You know, it's not, there's nothing like that
1424000	1428000	I mean, most people are not going to know what it means
1428000	1431000	They're just going to hear it and they're going to say, hey, that sounds African
1431000	1434000	Hey, that fits with the level in the game
1434000	1436000	Because that's what I heard and that's what I thought
1436000	1438000	I'm like, hell, this song is fucking awesome
1438000	1442000	So put this in context to the game of why this music would be here in the first place
1442000	1446000	Like, you know, in the Africa level you hear African style music
1446000	1448000	In the South America level you hear South American style music
1448000	1452000	So in the, you know, in a level that's appropriate you hear this music
1452000	1455000	It's world music, basically, so you're traveling to different parts of the world
1455000	1459000	But somehow this slipped under the radar where, you know, people didn't realize that this could be offensive
1459000	1462000	Even though the song's been out there for a while when nothing's said
1462000	1466000	Well, keep in mind also, this is what I drew a parallel to
1466000	1471000	Why aren't Christian groups being offended at Rock Band 2 for having System of a Down in it?
1471000	1473000	They probably are
1473000	1474000	They probably are
1474000	1477000	Why did the game come out then with that song in it if people are going to be offended?
1477000	1480000	Probably because Christian groups don't care because they have their own music with lines for the Bible
1480000	1482000	And they're, you know, it's Christian rock
1482000	1485000	And they're just like, hell yeah, spread the word, you know, but, um
1485000	1487000	But it's the same equivalent is what I'm saying
1487000	1489000	But I'm just sorry, I mean
1491000	1496000	If I get, you know, pissed off, okay, if something I find offensive in a game and I write Sony a letter
1496000	1498000	They're going to be like, fuck off
1498000	1502000	If I say I'm Arab, then they're like, oh, oh, now we're going to listen to you
1502000	1504000	Double fucking standard
1504000	1506000	I disagree, I disagree, I completely disagree
1506000	1509000	And especially something that's going on in the country
1509000	1514000	Especially over here is that we're seeing people catering to different ethnic groups
1514000	1517000	Because of this whole perception of oppression
1517000	1520000	That really should not exist in America in the modern world
1520000	1524000	I am going to put together a letter then to Sony and Media Monocle
1524000	1529000	And I'm going to tell them how deeply offended I am that they are censoring the game
1529000	1534000	You know, when, I don't understand why if we offend one person
1534000	1537000	I don't get why it's a big deal if we're offended
1537000	1545000	I actually do wonder how Sony would have reacted if the letter came that had absolutely no reference to the person sending it being Muslim
1545000	1549000	Or if they specifically said, I am not Muslim, however
1549000	1552000	Their reaction would have been different
1552000	1554000	There is a freaking double standard, I'm sorry
1554000	1557000	I'm going to, just to give some context to this
1557000	1559000	I'm going to play the clip from this game
1559000	1562000	It's hit the gaming blog, somebody recorded it off their phone
1562000	1564000	I'm going to give credit where credit is due
1564000	1570000	We pulled this from Kotaku where I believe one of their users got the sound clip and posted it on the site there
1570000	1574000	I'm going to play it, if you think for whatever reason this might offend you
1574000	1577000	I urge you to not listen to the next minute of the program
1577000	1579000	But I just want to give this some context
1579000	1583000	And so that our listeners can understand kind of where the controversy might be spreading from
1583000	1596000	I'm going to play the clip
1596000	1618000	So it definitely sets a certain type of world mood, right, this music
1618000	1623000	And there's an awful lot of ignorant Americans out there that are not going to know anything what was just said
1623000	1628000	Not going to know any of that, just going to think, oh it matches the mood
1628000	1633000	I know three words in Arabic and I couldn't say them off the top of my head
1633000	1635000	So how was that?
1635000	1638000	Look, I want to present a different opinion here
1638000	1642000	Because I think although I do see the overreaction going on here a little bit
1642000	1646000	And I think you're right, there are other religious things that are offensive that are in video games
1646000	1651000	I think in a way Sony's doing us all a favor by pulling this game
1651000	1655000	Is it a little bit hypersensitive? Yes, but is it Sony's fault? No
1655000	1657000	Whose fault is it? The media's fault
1657000	1663000	Because unfortunately if this had gone out and the wrong person had heard about it
1663000	1670000	And instead CNN, Al Jazeera, MSNBC gets a letter about this
1670000	1672000	Then it's suddenly going to be all over the mainstream press that
1672000	1676000	Oh my gosh, video games are teaching children passages from the Quran
1676000	1678000	And it's over, you know what I mean at that point
1678000	1685000	It's just another outrage of the violence in games and the messages that games are teaching us
1685000	1686000	Now it's religious text
1686000	1688000	Well who's going to say that it's not going to happen anyways?
1688000	1698000	And now let's see, how about the people representing Mexico saying that they don't like the way that Mexicans are portrayed in this game
1698000	1700000	Or how about the way that South America is portrayed in this game
1700000	1701000	Or how about the way that, you know
1701000	1705000	I see Sony sees smoke and they're trying to put out the fire before it spreads
1705000	1708000	I kind of, and forgive me for going to a comedian on this one
1708000	1714000	But I kind of want to quote Carlos Mencia about talking about people being offended about the Taco Bell dog
1714000	1722000	He's like, the Taco Bell dog sends out messages for people that Mexicans are stupid
1722000	1725000	He's like, no, it's sending out messages to buy more tacos
1725000	1729000	You know, it's people looking to be offended at something
1729000	1738000	It's people that are trying to find an excuse to, I really do think it's people just trying to find some sort of excuse
1738000	1741000	To put a little drama into their lives, to break up the monotony
1741000	1746000	Instead of trying to just say, hey, it's in there, I don't care
1746000	1751000	You know, why, it's not, if you're going to be offended at it being in the game
1751000	1754000	Be offended at the person that recorded the song to begin with
1754000	1759000	And in a way, yeah, I'm kind of like, well, where is the stink about this back in 2006
1759000	1762000	But then again, us being gamers, you know, maybe we didn't hear about it
1762000	1764000	Maybe there was a fuss and we didn't hear about it, I don't know
1764000	1767000	But I highly doubt there was or, you know, it would have been on the news
1767000	1769000	And I think all of us watch the news on a regular enough basis
1769000	1773000	We would have heard something about it, especially considering the guy who recorded this won a Grammy
1773000	1777000	However, I don't think the mainstream media would have given a fuck
1777000	1779000	I think they would have placed blame on the game
1779000	1781000	And I think Sony is just trying to put out that fire
1781000	1784000	It's sad, but that's the world we live in
1784000	1785000	It sucks, but
1785000	1787000	No, I agree with you that Sony is straight
1787000	1792000	But I also do think that it would not have gotten as much attention from Sony
1792000	1797000	Had it not specifically said, I and other Muslims are offended by this
1797000	1801000	Because we do have that double standard
1801000	1805000	That if you are some sort of oppressed group, and I say oppressed in quotes
1805000	1808000	That you automatically have to have someone throw you a bone
1808000	1810000	I'm sorry, that's not how it works
1810000	1812000	Was this dude like the only Muslim person playing this game?
1812000	1814000	You know, in the beta or something?
1814000	1816000	It was one person in the beta, he posted about it
1816000	1820000	And found other people in his religious group that were equally offended
1820000	1821000	Were they playing the game?
1821000	1824000	I have a hard time believing he was the one and only Muslim in the beta
1824000	1825000	No, that's what I just said
1825000	1829000	He was talking to other people in other forums like he said in his letter
1829000	1832000	To his credit, his letter was well worded and very respectful
1832000	1834000	That I do have to commend him on
1834000	1836000	And he wasn't asking for the game to be recalled
1836000	1840000	And I don't think we're placing any of the blame on this guy at all for maybe bringing it to light
1840000	1844000	I believe it specifically said, future releases not contain it
1844000	1847000	Patch the first releases, future printings, don't include it
1847000	1851000	That's acceptable, and that's part of what the beta is there for
1851000	1854000	To weed out offensive material, to weed out bugs
1854000	1858000	To make sure that you're releasing clean, safe content
1858000	1861000	Relative to the content you're releasing, you know what I mean?
1861000	1869000	To be honest, that's about the equivalent of what they would have done had, granted that I was San Andreas, come out on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3
1869000	1875000	They would have patched it, and then they would have made sure that all additional copies would not contain that content
1875000	1881000	But I am going to, like I said before, I don't know that Sony
1881000	1883000	I think he was right
1883000	1887000	The guy who sent the letter was right to voice his concern
1887000	1890000	If he felt like it was a big enough concern, he was right to voice it
1890000	1892000	Because what's one thing that I always say?
1892000	1896000	Nothing changes until you put forth the effort to make it change, am I correct?
1896000	1899000	I think though that the recall should be voluntary
1899000	1901000	Because if you are offended by it, then yes
1901000	1906000	They should give you the opportunity to send in your copy of the game so that you don't have to hear that
1906000	1911000	But if a person like me, who thinks the song is pretty kick-ass and doesn't really care what it says
1911000	1915000	Wants to keep it, then I don't see what the big deal is
1915000	1917000	And see, that's part of what I-
1917000	1923000	Because now they're oppressing me and my desire to have this song in the game
1923000	1925000	For my own personal use
1925000	1928000	And they're oppressing me to benefit somebody else
1928000	1929000	That is my problem
1929000	1933000	I don't have a problem with someone being offended by it and they're fixing it for them
1933000	1936000	But I want to be able to keep my game the way it is
1936000	1938000	That's the point I was getting to
1938000	1941000	If you are offended by something, then sure
1941000	1944000	They should give you the option to remove the offensive content
1944000	1948000	But for those who are not offended by it, those who don't care
1948000	1951000	It's pointless
1951000	1952000	You're wasting time and money
1952000	1954000	You could just put out a patch
1954000	1956000	Why should one-
1956000	1962000	Because one group of people is offended by content that does not offend
1962000	1966000	Now, especially when the content is not attacking another group
1966000	1968000	Now if this was content that was saying
1968000	1972000	We hate all of so-and-such's group, kill them all
1972000	1975000	Then, yes, it should be removed, don't you think?
1975000	1980000	But if it's just something, not even a specific statement just saying
1980000	1984000	Oh, well one day the Earth is gone and all this stuff is gonna happen
1984000	1986000	Well it's just like reading Revelations, really
1986000	1988000	I mean, that-
1988000	1994000	It's nothing that's directed towards a party that anyone who is not in that faith
1994000	1996000	Would really get the reference to
1996000	1999000	You know, I just don't think there's an easy answer to this
1999000	2002000	I think this whole story is just a reflection of the world we live in
2002000	2004000	People are just too fucking offended
2004000	2005000	I know
2005000	2008000	But you know, I'm sitting here thinking, it's live radio
2008000	2011000	And sometimes I'm giving a lot of these stories a lot of thought
2011000	2013000	As we're sitting here talking about them
2013000	2016000	And I'm thinking, there's a story coming up later in the show in Part B
2016000	2018000	Where we're gonna talk about something that's coming out in an upcoming game
2018000	2020000	That kind of offends me a little bit
2020000	2025000	And although I can take offense, I know how to be offended or whatever
2025000	2027000	It's just kind of one of those things where, gosh
2027000	2029000	You know, even I look at some of the things that happen in video games
2029000	2031000	And I go, this is so stupid
2031000	2035000	Like, I wish games would kind of learn how to, I don't know
2035000	2037000	Address some of these things more appropriately
2037000	2041000	And in a way I feel like a hypocrite kind of sitting here going
2041000	2044000	You know, well everybody should just kind of learn to deal with it
2044000	2046000	When I'm thinking about, well come think of it
2046000	2048000	There are some things in video games that offend me
2048000	2051000	And exactly, but do you think that you would get equal representation
2051000	2054000	If you had emailed that company that makes that game
2054000	2056000	Hell to the no
2056000	2058000	Exactly, exactly my damn point
2058000	2062000	I'm sorry, there's, what about Redneck Rampage, okay?
2062000	2066000	Now while I personally don't consider myself to be a redneck
2066000	2071000	I do consider quite a number of my relatives to be purely
2071000	2076000	Jeff Foxworthy defines redneck as someone completely lacking in sophistication
2076000	2079000	I agree, that's most of my family
2079000	2082000	Not my immediate, but aunts and uncles and cousins and what have you
2082000	2086000	Anyway, but then, so if I said, you know, I'm from, you know
2086000	2090000	Mobile, Alabama and I'm offended at this game
2090000	2095000	Or I'm offended at how you've portrayed this southern person in this game as being stupid
2095000	2098000	Just because they talk a little slower and have a thick accent
2098000	2101000	That doesn't mean that their IQ is any lower than anybody else's
2101000	2104000	You know, I could say I'm offended at that
2104000	2107000	Or I could just laugh and go, I'm related to people like that
2107000	2111000	Which is basically my opinion towards Larry the Cable Guy
2111000	2115000	Basically, just watch South Park, there was that one episode basically saying
2115000	2117000	You know, about pulling a family guy off TV
2117000	2121000	If you do it for one person, then what's, you know, you have to do it for everybody
2121000	2125000	You know, I don't know, I don't know if this is a can of worms I want to open
2125000	2128000	But what the hell, we're here, we do this show for a reason to talk about things
2128000	2131000	But, you know, the story I want to talk about later has to do with an upcoming game
2131000	2134000	That just reinforces gay stereotypes I wish would go away
2134000	2137000	You know, and as a gay man, it gets really old after a while
2137000	2139000	You know, seeing some of these gay stereotypes in games
2139000	2143000	So I just kind of sit here and go, God, I wish I would just, you know, fucking grow up
2143000	2145000	You know, some of these people that program the games
2145000	2148000	So I'm thinking to myself, but at the same time, you know, maybe there's people that are Arab
2148000	2151000	That are sick of some of these stereotypes that are in the game
2151000	2154000	About, you know, the, you know, the verses that are being said
2154000	2157000	I don't know, you know, in a way, I just don't want to be a hypocrite here
2157000	2158000	But see, that's the thing
2158000	2161000	There's quite a bit of difference between what you're discussing and what's going on
2161000	2162000	This is just
2162000	2165000	Well, at the same time, CNN would never run a story either
2165000	2168000	On the fact that this other game comes out and offends gay people
2168000	2169000	That would never happen, never happen
2169000	2172000	Because it's stereotypes that a lot of people think about
2172000	2175000	Well, going back to the massive double standard
2175000	2179000	About what's considered bigotry and what's not, really
2179000	2181000	You know, it's like I was just saying in the chat room
2181000	2183000	You know, racism is racism
2183000	2184000	It doesn't matter
2184000	2187000	Like, I brought up an example
2187000	2188000	We did a diversity class at my work
2188000	2190000	You know, any corporation does diversity classes
2190000	2192000	And I brought a situation
2192000	2194000	And I think I said it on the show
2194000	2196000	When I worked in Alabama at Aladdin's Castle
2196000	2202000	Where this black lady and her children wanted me to change out quarters
2202000	2204000	Give them, you know, make change for them
2204000	2207000	And I said, I'm sorry, I can't make change for you because you're not a customer
2207000	2210000	She just wandered in from the store across the street
2210000	2211000	And not across the street, but across the aisle
2211000	2214000	And she's like, you're just doing that because I'm black and love
2214000	2218000	I'm like, no, I'm doing it because you're not a paying customer here
2218000	2221000	If you want me to make change for you, there's a street fighter machine right there
2221000	2223000	And she shut up and walked away
2223000	2225000	So, but you see what I mean
2225000	2227000	Racism is racism
2227000	2228000	Bigotry is bigotry
2228000	2233000	And as long as we perpetuate, you know, that type of thought
2233000	2236000	And as long as we keep getting offended
2236000	2239000	Instead of just learning to roll a little bit with the punches
2239000	2241000	Give a little, take a little
2241000	2243000	Then what's going to happen?
2243000	2246000	You know, we're breeding a different kind of intolerance
2246000	2248000	Don't you think?
2248000	2250000	That's a reasonable answer, thank you
2250000	2253000	Alright, let's go see what the Twitter had to say
2253000	2256000	Every week we like to post something on OLR
2256000	2260000	And obviously this is a story that's generating a lot of buzz out there in the gaming community
2260000	2264000	And just, I think it's invoking a reaction that goes a lot of ways beyond gaming
2264000	2267000	So I'm kind of curious to see what happens over the next couple of weeks
2267000	2269000	Of course then this game will come out censored
2269000	2271000	And people will forget years from now
2271000	2274000	But anyhow, the question we asked our folks on Twitter
2274000	2275000	Twitter.com slash OLR
2275000	2279000	Did Sony overreact by recalling LittleBigPlanet due to the controversial music in the game?
2279000	2280000	Why or why not?
2280000	2283000	And here's some of the responses that we got on our Twitter
2283000	2286000	Starting off with Dark Tetsuya
2286000	2289000	Yes, since the fix was the simplest day one patch
2289000	2292000	There wasn't that much of a need to delay the game a whole week
2292000	2295000	But let's not forget, not everybody has online capability
2295000	2298000	Crows says, of course they didn't overreact
2298000	2301000	This being America, everyone sues for anything
2301000	2302000	Sony wants to avoid a lawsuit
2302000	2305000	Point, but this was also a worldwide recall
2305000	2306000	Let's not forget that
2306000	2308000	And I don't know about lawsuit
2308000	2311000	I'm not trying to prove all our listeners wrong
2311000	2314000	I'm sorry, but I just want to say
2314000	2315000	Look at this too
2315000	2319000	Geekboy2424 says, yes, nobody would have noticed if they wouldn't have mentioned it
2319000	2322000	The person who heard this had to have scanned it
2322000	2324000	Well, he was a beta tester, right?
2324000	2328000	Not to mention that he's also probably very familiar with the Quran as well
2328000	2332000	I don't know about you, but if someone quotes Bible versus me
2332000	2334000	I don't know what the hell they're talking about
2334000	2338000	Well, I do know, and this is just a little bit I know
2338000	2340000	Because one of my co-workers is Muslim
2340000	2344000	Is that their prayers are done in Arabic, if I'm correct
2344000	2348000	And so you do end up learning a little bit of Arabic as you study
2348000	2350000	Let me read some of these other responses
2350000	2353000	Marin Marvel says, I think that it was overreacting a bit
2353000	2355000	But I can understand because of not wanting to offend people
2355000	2357000	Especially in this too happy day and age
2357000	2360000	Dust Stories says, wait, we have to please everyone and offend no one
2360000	2362000	We better stop the world now then
2362000	2363000	Big overreaction
2363000	2366000	Peter Uno says, hell no, oh fine, enough of that
2366000	2368000	To be honest, political correctness is going overboard
2368000	2371000	It seems silly that nobody cared until launch
2371000	2374000	Gold Anthro says, yes, with the game being awaited for so long
2374000	2377000	Just to remove it for something so small seems unnecessary
2377000	2381000	DJ Tyrant says, no, it was something that needed to be removed and caught earlier
2381000	2384000	Not everyone is connected to the interwebs either
2384000	2389000	The SEG says, considering worldwide reactions to cartoons, absolutely not
2389000	2391000	Recalls are less expensive than riots
2391000	2393000	Interesting point, interesting point
2393000	2397000	Decipher13 says, with people suing for less these days, Sony didn't overreact
2397000	2401000	Receiving the game at work and it being recalled in the same day was odd
2401000	2403000	So there you have it, some of our comments from the Twitter
2403000	2405000	At twitter.com slash OLR
2405000	2408000	And I'm sure this will go on for quite some time
2408000	2411000	I'm curious to see what kind of emails we get this week
2411000	2418000	I don't know, again, I think this is the type of quandary to where there's no easy answer
2418000	2421000	There's no easy solution because unfortunately there are people that will get offended
2421000	2426000	And it could affect gaming's perception out there as a whole
2426000	2429000	And it's just a shame, it's a shame
2429000	2435000	It's just, I really, my last two cents on it really
2435000	2441000	Is just, I'm not looking forward to a world where no one can have any sort of free thought or opinion of their own
2441000	2444000	Without someone else trying to strike them down for being wrong
2444000	2448000	My final thing is, I don't have a problem
2448000	2452000	He wants to make a comment, so do I
2452000	2455000	Don't be oppressing me, woman, seriously
2455000	2457000	Estrogen Brigade!
2457000	2462000	Now, I don't have a problem with them fixing it for the people that want it to be fixed
2462000	2466000	But I do have a problem with them fixing it for the people that don't really care
2466000	2469000	Or want it to be fixed in the first place
2469000	2474000	All I gotta say is they better replace it with a damn good song because that really fit with the game
2474000	2477000	And, I don't know, make an instrumental version of it or something
2477000	2479000	Perfect, perfect solution
2479000	2482000	Alright, well, we'll see what happens
2482000	2487000	I don't really have a final thought on this because I think I'm still developing one
2487000	2489000	So, let's go back to the Dick and Fart jokes
2489000	2491000	They should totally put in Two Knock Two Knock
2491000	2496000	Well, I don't know if Dick and Fart jokes were included with these
2496000	2500000	But PS3 and the PSP have received brand new firmware updates
2500000	2504000	The PS3 at a whopping 2.50
2504000	2507000	And PSP at, now, 5.0 firmwares
2507000	2510000	Some of the brand new features included with that
2510000	2515000	The PSP version is getting the PlayStation Online Store now
2515000	2517000	Which is pretty awesome
2517000	2522000	Also, the PS3 version, Flash 9 support
2522000	2525000	Oh boy, that's gonna be some good stuff
2525000	2528000	That probably means that some of those Flash IRC chats work now
2528000	2530000	Or what about some of those Flash emulators?
2530000	2532000	Or some of the Flash emulators
2532000	2534000	That's where my mind went instantly
2534000	2539000	Half the reason people bought a PSP in the beginning was to play Nintendo emulators on them
2539000	2541000	And now everything kind of comes full circle
2541000	2544000	Well, I was kind of disappointed that Flash 9 is not on the PSP
2544000	2546000	Because that makes things a lot easier
2546000	2548000	But no, just on the PS3
2548000	2557000	And also, I guess, they're including support now for the official PS3 Bluetooth adapter
2557000	2561000	Because they're now releasing a new headset that's gonna be with SOCOM and stuff
2561000	2566000	You can set your system to automatically shut down after downloading stuff
2566000	2570000	And then, I have to remember what else was added with the PSP
2570000	2573000	Probably just some minor fixes and stuff
2573000	2576000	And trying to fix it so that no one can crack it
2576000	2578000	Oh darn, too bad that failed again
2578000	2581000	So apparently the day after it came out
2581000	2585000	It was already cracked and the custom firmware 5.0 was released
2585000	2589000	Ah, Sony, you try, you try, but you fail and you fail
2589000	2593000	So, uh, oh well
2593000	2598000	Do you think somebody's gonna come up with a patch to patch the offensive music back in LittleBigPlanet?
2598000	2600000	Not to go back to that story, but
2600000	2604000	You know, with people that want to keep breaking Sony, what Sony destroys
2604000	2608000	I did want to mention though, there was a story that we didn't make it in there
2608000	2611000	One of the things that was included with the new PS3 firmware
2611000	2617000	Is there's a recovery menu that you can access now by holding down the power button
2617000	2619000	Until you hear three beeps
2619000	2621000	And that'll allow you to fix bad firmware updates
2621000	2624000	Say your power goes out or something like that while it's installing
2624000	2626000	Or god knows something happens
2626000	2628000	And a bunch of other things
2628000	2631000	So you can actually help recover your system so it doesn't break
2631000	2635000	Which is nice, I'm glad that they threw that in there
2635000	2641000	Alright, well hey, you know, some of the things that they're also kind of reformatting on the Sony side
2641000	2646000	Especially when it comes into the store and how things are being presented on the online store
2646000	2649000	It looks like companies are now starting to get their own little special stores
2649000	2651000	Capcom is one of the first that we're hearing about
2651000	2655000	Capcom has their own little like company version of the Playstation store
2655000	2660000	If you go to the Capcom store you can get all of Capcom stuff kind of in one little place on the Playstation Network store
2660000	2664000	You get the Capcom demos, their games, their themes, it's all in one spot
2664000	2668000	Now funny enough this wasn't an idea of Capcom's, it was actually Sony's
2668000	2670000	Who I guess must have presented the idea to them
2670000	2673000	And if you think this is going to be only in the Sony side of things
2673000	2676000	Guess what, they're saying that the new Xbox experience that's coming out
2676000	2679000	Means that Microsoft will be able to do something similar for their companies
2679000	2684000	So it's going to be very interesting is that you almost now are going to go from one
2684000	2688000	It's kind of cool in a way, in my mind I'm envisioning now that online shopping for these networks
2688000	2694000	Is now going from one giant everything stop shop that the company owns
2694000	2697000	Like Microsoft's Walmart or Sony's Target
2697000	2700000	Is now going to be like a strip mall
2700000	2703000	Where you can go into the Capcom store and go into the Konami store
2703000	2706000	It's going to be interesting to see what each company has to offer
2706000	2711000	It's going to be very very interesting to see what this does for like company branding in the video games
2711000	2712000	You know what I mean?
2712000	2714000	Like what stores will people visit first?
2714000	2716000	And who puts out what product?
2716000	2718000	Because you know back in the days of the NES
2718000	2721000	I don't think a lot of people followed these things
2721000	2726000	Most people didn't even know that Konami and Ultra were really the same company
2726000	2729000	They just would follow a particular series or whatever
2729000	2732000	But it's very interesting now that we have this very company branded atmosphere
2732000	2734000	That these online stores are going to create
2734000	2735000	Could be interesting
2735000	2737000	Of course I could be talking a whole lot of nothing
2737000	2739000	What ends up being really no big deal
2739000	2742000	Because it still is going to be one centralized place too I'm sure
2742000	2746000	But who knows? We'll see when the new Xbox experience comes out
2746000	2748000	When more of these stores launch on the Playstation side
2748000	2753000	I had to make a response to Geekboy2424 in the chat room
2753000	2754000	What did he say?
2754000	2759000	He disagrees with me that parents shouldn't please let their children play
2759000	2761000	Yes they should
2761000	2763000	It's the parent's job
2763000	2765000	However
2765000	2770000	Don't miss out that I have said parents need to be educated
2770000	2775000	And actually research instead of making a blanket assumption
2775000	2777000	It doesn't mean parents should put the ban hammer down
2777000	2780000	I think Geekboy2424 is a rather younger listener of ours
2780000	2783000	Which is why I think he might get a little bit hurt
2783000	2786000	That we're saying your parents need to be watching or whatever
2786000	2789000	But we're not saying the parents need to ban everything
2789000	2791000	The parents need to be watching
2791000	2793000	And the parents should at least know what you're doing
2793000	2796000	As far as this show is concerned
2796000	2799000	I don't think folks of a certain age should necessarily even be listening to this show
2799000	2802000	Without the parents kind of knowing what they're listening to on the internet
2802000	2804000	I like to think we're a good influence and not a bad one
2804000	2806000	But your parents have a right to know
2806000	2809000	This is my suggestion, this is what I used to do with my mother
2809000	2812000	True, it was over NES games when I was much younger
2812000	2816000	But why don't you find a review of the game
2816000	2819000	Find some video clips of the game
2819000	2822000	And then say, hey, this is the game that I want to play
2822000	2824000	Do you mind if we pick it up?
2824000	2830000	And being an adult, hopefully they should be able to make a decision
2830000	2834000	Whether or not they consider what you think okay is okay
2834000	2836000	Recognize some of your passion behind it too
2836000	2837000	Exactly
2837000	2842000	Maybe you'll get props for like, wow, our kid actually put together a whole little prosecution
2842000	2845000	Instead of just going, but I want it
2845000	2847000	Which was, I've tried that a couple times too
2847000	2848000	Yeah, me too
2848000	2851000	Then they'll say, well, you've obviously put some thought into it
2851000	2856000	Maybe I should think that maybe you're old enough to have an opinion
2856000	2859000	I'm sorry, kids, we've got smart kids out there
2859000	2863000	People who definitely have an opinion shouldn't just be discounted because of their age
2863000	2864000	Right?
2864000	2865000	That's true
2865000	2869000	So help your parents make an informed decision
2869000	2873000	If you truly think that you should have this game, put some effort into it
2873000	2874000	Let them know why
2874000	2875000	So my next story
2875000	2876000	Yeah, go ahead
2876000	2877000	Sorry
2877000	2882000	There has been a little bit of a tease now
2882000	2887000	That those who finished the PlayStation 3 version of Bioshock
2887000	2893000	Get a little teaser trailer saying Bioshock 2 Sea of Dreams
2893000	2896000	Is supposed to come out sometime in the future
2896000	2902000	And there's actually, I think, some video up around this
2902000	2906000	Up on Joystiq if anyone wants to take a look at it
2906000	2907000	And it's your typical teaser
2907000	2911000	I watched it just because I thought the first Bioshock was pretty graphically stunning
2911000	2914000	Just to tell you the teaser is your typical teaser video
2914000	2919000	It's nothing but, you know, the one shot of the girls standing on the beach or whatever
2919000	2922000	And the one line, it's a teaser in every sense of the word
2922000	2923000	On the Atlantic Coast
2923000	2924000	And just the fact it's coming
2924000	2927000	And it gives you that tagline, Sea of Dreams
2927000	2928000	And that's it
2928000	2929000	Yeah
2929000	2931000	That's what a teaser is
2931000	2935000	So in other words, Bioshock 2 is coming
2935000	2936000	Duh, you know what I mean?
2936000	2938000	They needed some teasing to do that
2938000	2941000	I guess now you have a subtitle, so there you go
2941000	2943000	When's it coming out? Soon
2943000	2944000	Soon, someday
2944000	2946000	Actually I don't think it's coming out too soon
2946000	2948000	A few years, well maybe
2948000	2949000	2010
2949000	2950000	Soon is a blanket term
2950000	2952000	Summer 2010, I don't know, that's a guess
2952000	2953000	I say summer 2010
2953000	2956000	I like that, we'll just use that from everything now
2956000	2957000	What?
2957000	2958000	Summer 2010
2958000	2959000	That's when all the games are coming out
2959000	2961000	That's when Final Fantasy 13 is coming out, summer 2010
2961000	2964000	We'll be lucky if it comes out by that time
2964000	2965000	Alright
2965000	2966000	Release dates
2966000	2969000	Well there are other games coming out
2969000	2971000	This week at least
2971000	2975000	Starting off, we've got
2975000	2978000	The World of Goo, which is coming to PC
2978000	2979000	Fun little casual game there
2979000	2981000	Did very well on a
2981000	2983000	I think it's on the Wii already, I'm not sure
2983000	2985000	As part of the WiiWare
2985000	2989000	And of course, today
2989000	2992000	Rock Band 2 finally made it out on the PS3
2992000	2998000	Also the special edition bundles for PS3 and Xbox 360 are now available
2998000	3003000	The Naked Brothers Band is coming out
3003000	3005000	With a game, a karaoke game
3005000	3008000	Playstation 2 and the Wii for that one
3008000	3010000	Hooray
3010000	3013000	Penny Racer's Party Turbo Q Speedway
3013000	3015000	Apparently that got delayed from last week
3015000	3017000	And that's hopefully coming out this week now
3017000	3021000	Spongebob
3021000	3024000	Featuring Nicktoons and the Globs of Doom
3024000	3029000	Will be out on Playstation 2, the Wii, and on the DS
3029000	3032000	Let's see here
3032000	3036000	Back at the Barnyard, slot bucket games for the DS
3036000	3040000	We have Midnight Club Los Angeles on Playstation 3
3040000	3042000	And the Xbox 360
3042000	3046000	Also Midnight Club LA Remix for the PSP
3046000	3049000	Midnight Club is a pretty awesome racing game
3049000	3051000	I'll play that a little bit at PAX
3051000	3055000	Pass the Pigs, coming to DS
3055000	3058000	That's that old dice game, Pigs, if you remember that
3058000	3061000	Oh, they would land in the certain formations?
3061000	3063000	Oh my god, okay
3063000	3065000	Yeah, whopping 20 bucks for that
3065000	3069000	Why would you play a dice game on a video game?
3069000	3070000	I don't know
3070000	3071000	It's a good travel game
3071000	3073000	You can't throw pigs around in a car
3073000	3074000	They'll get lost
3074000	3075000	Alright, fair enough
3075000	3076000	Why do people buy Uno on Xbox Live?

3108000	3109000	What does it matter?
3109000	3111000	If you had to pay for it, would you?
3111000	3112000	No
3112000	3113000	Okay, that's what I thought
3113000	3114000	I'm getting it for free

3235000	3236000	Whoopee
3236000	3239000	I think that's all the big stuff
3239000	3241000	Taking a quick look here
3241000	3243000	Let's travel over to Japan, take a look at the Japanese release dates
3243000	3246000	There's not a lot to speak of on the Xbox 360
3246000	3250000	NBA Live 09 gets its Japanese localization on October 23
3250000	3252000	That coming out from EA over in Japan
3252000	3254000	Heading on over to the PlayStation 3
3254000	3256000	I imagine they're getting the same thing, and they sure are
3256000	3260000	Also, by the way, on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3
3260000	3263000	Gundam Musou is getting a price reduction on both systems
3263000	3265000	So if you haven't checked that out yet, you can
3265000	3268000	Moving on to the Nintendo Wii in Japan
3268000	3271000	The Happy Dance Collection comes out from Namco Bandai this week
3271000	3273000	As well as Gensai Table Games Wii
3273000	3276000	Pro Golfers Saru and Tenchu 4 comes out

3283000	3286000	Devil Summoner, a new game in the Devil Summoner series
3286000	3288000	Comes out on October 23
3288000	3291000	As well as Ever17, the Out of Infinity
3291000	3293000	Although I think that might just be a price reduction
3293000	3295000	Yeah, that's just a price reduction
3295000	3300000	Also, Hakugen no Soryou Contract to Future comes out as well
3300000	3303000	And NBA Live 09 on PlayStation 2 as well
3303000	3306000	And a game called Never 7, the End of Infinity
3306000	3308000	Also gets a price reduction as well as Remember 11
3308000	3312000	And Sakura Taisen 3 also goes into Sega The Best series
3312000	3314000	So lots of price reductions this week
3314000	3316000	Price reductions this week
3316000	3319000	Didn't it get out to like 5 in the Sakura Taisen series?
3319000	3322000	I don't know how far they got, but it's just number 3
3322000	3324000	I think 4 came out on Dreamcast, didn't it?
3324000	3326000	3 was out on PlayStation 2, I guess
3326000	3328000	I don't know if that was a newer version or what
3328000	3329000	Could be
3329000	3334000	On the Nintendo DS, Dragon Quest Monsters Joker gets a price reduction
3334000	3336000	As does Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 12 Revenant Wings
3336000	3338000	Both getting price reductions as well
3338000	3341000	As far as new games go, you got Katsuie Death Label
3341000	3344000	As well as Kimi no Yuusha comes out from SNK Playmore
3344000	3348000	On the DS, as well as Soul Eater, Medusa no Inubu comes out
3348000	3351000	And Wakamama Fashion Gals Mode
3351000	3352000	Because I know you were looking forward to that
3352000	3353000	That sounds funny
3353000	3356000	That is a first party title in Japan, so go figure
3356000	3359000	Quickly looking at the Sony PSP to see what comes out this week
3359000	3362000	Bleach Soul Carnival looks to be a big title they're getting
3362000	3366000	And I know a lot of Bamani and music game fans are very excited about this
3366000	3370000	One of my really good friends is obsessed with DJ Max
3370000	3374000	And there's a new DJ Max game coming out this week on the Sony PSP
3374000	3377000	From what I understand, there also is going to be a US version of this game before November
3377000	3378000	I want Soul Eater
3378000	3379000	So there you go, what's that?
3379000	3380000	I want Soul Eater
3380000	3381000	You want Soul Eater?
3381000	3385000	I was going to say their one small game I missed
3385000	3386000	What's that?
3386000	3388000	Coming out a week from today
3388000	3390000	Guitar Hero World Tour
3390000	3393000	It will be coming out on everything
3393000	3395000	Well that's because it's not a Tuesday game
3395000	3397000	It's a Sunday game
3397000	3401000	And it's going to be epic I guess
3401000	3405000	By the way, to specify, DJ Max is the Classic Y edition
3405000	3408000	There already is several DJ Max games on the PSP
3408000	3409000	This is the Classic Y edition
3409000	3412000	By the way, one other game I want to point out on the PSP this week in Japan
3412000	3415000	From Sega, Garnet Chronicle comes out as well
3415000	3417000	DarkSaga, take us to Europe
3417000	3419000	Here are our European releases
3419000	3422000	Well at least as far as the UK is concerned
3422000	3427000	We have on the 21st EverQuest seeds of destruction
3427000	3430000	I just like saying destruction, that's pretty freaking awesome
3430000	3431000	A name with destruction
3431000	3432000	Destruction of destruction?
3432000	3434000	This should just be ultimate destruction
3434000	3436000	Destroying the destructors
3436000	3437000	Or something
3437000	3439000	New game from OLR Studios
3439000	3441000	On the 24th we have Dead Space
3441000	3443000	Looking forward to that
3443000	3445000	Disaster Day of Crisis
3445000	3446000	Dungeon Maker
3446000	3447000	Fable 2
3447000	3450000	Which actually my husband has to work for the midnight launch tomorrow
3450000	3452000	So I'm going to laugh
3452000	3455000	We also have Legendary on Xbox 360
3455000	3457000	Well I don't
3457000	3460000	LittleBigPlanet is given the 24th date
3460000	3463000	Although we know that's not going to happen anymore
3463000	3465000	Exactly, but I'm just saying
3465000	3470000	Also Midnight Club Los Angeles on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
3470000	3474000	As well as Midnight Club Los Angeles remix on PSP
3474000	3477000	Star Ocean The First Departure on PSP
3477000	3480000	Not too bad, huh?
3480000	3482000	Not a bad week at all
3482000	3486000	And it's just going to get busier and busier as we get closer to the holiday
3486000	3490000	Well that one last game that I had mentioned
3490000	3494000	Guitar Hero World Tour
3494000	3497000	Is very similar to another game series, Rock Band
3497000	3499000	And Rock Band of course is getting
3499000	3500000	You don't say
3500000	3502000	Yes, I don't say
3502000	3505000	Rock Band is getting a brand new download pack as it does every week
3505000	3508000	And this time it's Nirvana
3508000	3510000	You get 7 songs from Nirvana
3510000	3513000	Including Breed, Lounge Act, On a Plane
3513000	3518000	Polly, Something in the Way, Stay Away, and Territorial Pissings
3518000	3521000	And each of those is available for $2
3521000	3524000	Or you can save $3, buy the whole pack
3524000	3527000	For $11 or $880
3527000	3530000	But isn't it interesting that it's completely missing
3530000	3532000	Like the biggest songs on that album
3532000	3534000	Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are
3534000	3536000	I think was on that album too
3536000	3537000	Isn't that strange?
3537000	3539000	Yeah it is a little strange except
3539000	3541000	I think Smells Like Teen Spirit is in
3541000	3543000	Guitar Hero World Tour
3543000	3546000	And I'm not sure about the rest of them
3546000	3549000	Yeah but it's not like games haven't shared the same songs before
3549000	3551000	Well they may have exclusive rights to that song
3551000	3553000	Money talks
3553000	3555000	I guess
3555000	3558000	Alright well hey if you have opted for Guitar Hero World Tour
3558000	3560000	One of the things you can look forward to downloading next year
3560000	3562000	That's right they're announcing download stuff for next year
3562000	3564000	On the Guitar Hero side
3564000	3566000	The brand new Oasis album Dig Out Your Soul
3566000	3569000	I had no idea that Oasis was still putting out music
3569000	3571000	I haven't heard much of their stuff
3571000	3574000	There's probably some British folks over on the other side of the pond
3574000	3576000	That are like bonk to me
3576000	3578000	But they don't play them on the radio at all here anymore
3578000	3580000	Not since Wonderwall back in the mid 90's
3580000	3582000	But they are still cranking out music
3582000	3584000	They have a new album coming out Dig Out Your Soul
3584000	3586000	And that will be coming out next year
3586000	3588000	Some of the singles from that album
3588000	3590000	Bag It Up, Waiting For The Rapture, The Shock Of The Lightning
3590000	3592000	Are all coming out on Guitar Hero World Tour
3592000	3594000	So if you are an Oasis fan
3594000	3598000	And you're mad at me for my comment of not hearing them lately
3598000	3600000	You at least have that to look forward to
3600000	3602000	There you go
3602000	3604000	Well
3604000	3606000	Here's some more rumors
3606000	3608000	Hey wait a minute, you're the resident Blur fangirl
3608000	3610000	We haven't heard a lot of Blur
3610000	3612000	Like, I love Blur talk on the show lately
3612000	3616000	Didn't Blur and Oasis have like a feud thing years ago?
3616000	3618000	Did they ever get over that?
3618000	3622000	I think that, well since Blur is basically disbanded
3622000	3626000	Because Graham Coxon got really offended when they told him
3626000	3628000	STOP DRINKING
3628000	3630000	And he's like, well screw you guys
3630000	3632000	You throw me out of the band, I'm never coming back
3632000	3634000	You knew that was the story right?
3634000	3636000	Did he call them all bloody wankers?
3636000	3638000	Because if he did, that's too good
3638000	3642000	Probably things a lot worse than calling someone wanker
3642000	3644000	However
3644000	3646000	Graham Coxon has gone off to do his own thing
3646000	3652000	Damon has Gorillaz and also has The Good, The Bad, and The Queen
3652000	3654000	Which is pretty freaking good
3654000	3656000	Well I was thinking maybe if Guitar Hero is getting Oasis
3656000	3658000	This might mean Blur for Rock Band
3658000	3660000	If that whole little feud is totally on
3660000	3662000	I would totally love it if we had Blur for Rock Band
3662000	3664000	You know, we need to do a list list just for me
3664000	3668000	Of what Blur songs do we want to hear in Rock Band
3668000	3670000	We'll put that on the list of things to do
3670000	3672000	I'm sorry, we can move on now with news
3672000	3674000	Speaking of music games, there's a trailer
3674000	3678000	A trailer that doesn't really have much to do with anything as far as I'm concerned
3678000	3682000	But it's the Guitar Hero Metallica trailer
3682000	3686000	Obviously taken with a shaky webcam or phone cam
3686000	3690000	Or, you know, has no gameplay shown, no nothing like that
3690000	3692000	And those look good, Rob
3692000	3694000	What I'm eating, by the way
3694000	3696000	Orin Sam's Foodio for a minute
3696000	3698000	I found these when I was in the Bay Area this weekend
3698000	3700000	And I about crapped myself
3700000	3702000	I was so excited
3702000	3704000	They're flat fortune cookies
3704000	3706000	So they're fortune cookies, but they're just ironed out flat
3706000	3708000	And without the fortune, obviously, in them
3708000	3710000	But I love the taste of fortune cookies
3710000	3712000	And I know there's probably some of our listeners going
3712000	3714000	Big fucking deal
3714000	3716000	But you can't get these here, anywhere
3716000	3718000	I've looked
3718000	3720000	In the factory in the Bay Area to find them
3720000	3722000	Or Long's Drugs, apparently
3722000	3724000	Go figure
3724000	3726000	Sorry, random thought
3726000	3728000	I was just looking at the golden shiny goodness
3728000	3730000	Would you like one?
3730000	3732000	I would love one now
3732000	3734000	Here you go, I'm bringing it over
3734000	3736000	It's like a pancake, it looks like a freaking pancake
3736000	3738000	Hold up to the camera
3738000	3740000	Those of you that are watching on Justin TV, I'll give you a cookie too
3740000	3742000	While Jamie reads the story
3742000	3744000	Anyway, there is a very shaky teaser trailer
3744000	3746000	Up for Guitar Hero Metallica
3746000	3748000	Which I had been hearing
3748000	3750000	Them speak of before
3750000	3752000	So I don't think it's that far off
3752000	3754000	But it's saying
3754000	3756000	The trailer is supposed to come with Guitar Hero World Tour
3756000	3758000	And it has
3758000	3760000	A Ride the Lightning
3760000	3762000	You know, 2009
3762000	3764000	Something, so
3764000	3766000	Cause that's not cheesy or anything
3766000	3768000	I think Metallica has finally
3768000	3770000	Gotten off of their music
3770000	3772000	And electronic distribution
3772000	3774000	And just said, cool
3774000	3776000	Though they still have to do that
3776000	3778000	To be edgy, you know, but
3778000	3780000	They're going, so
3780000	3782000	And I do also have to say that the Metallica tracks
3782000	3784000	In Rock Band 2 are fucking hard
3784000	3786000	Maybe they just like playing Rock Band
3786000	3788000	In Guitar Hero
3788000	3790000	So they decide, you know, when Guitar Hero comes and says
3790000	3792000	Hey, we'll do a whole freaking
3792000	3794000	Game about you guys
3794000	3796000	And they're like, cool
3796000	3798000	Or they saw what they did with Aerosmith and were like, we want that shit
3798000	3800000	Well, and Metallica
3800000	3802000	Is the epitome of awesome
3802000	3804000	Rock before they sold out
3804000	3806000	So
3806000	3808000	Well, I hope
3808000	3810000	For their sake that they learn
3810000	3812000	They learn from Guitar Hero
3812000	3814000	Or not Guitar Hero
3814000	3816000	They learn from Rock Band and decide to
3816000	3818000	Go ahead and allow each of those
3818000	3820000	Games that they release separately
3820000	3822000	To be able to be downloaded
3822000	3824000	So that you can play tracks
3824000	3826000	In your Guitar Hero World Tour game
3826000	3828000	Cause that would suck otherwise
3828000	3830000	Especially if there's
3830000	3832000	A lot of games coming out like they were saying that they were gonna do
3832000	3834000	I don't know
3834000	3836000	Oh well
3836000	3838000	Well, something completely un-Guitar Hero related
3838000	3840000	South Peak
3840000	3842000	Has now bought the small independent
3842000	3844000	Game publishing company
3844000	3846000	Gamecock
3846000	3848000	Who apparently acts
3848000	3850000	I don't know, they act crazy
3850000	3852000	But they do release a lot of
3852000	3854000	Like a cock?
3854000	3856000	Yes, crazy like the cock
3856000	3858000	Apparently though, they release a lot of independent
3858000	3860000	Games of course like
3860000	3862000	I think actually
3862000	3864000	This week, I can't believe I forgot it
3864000	3866000	Legendary
3866000	3868000	Should be coming out
3868000	3870000	And that's one game that they're publishing as well as
3870000	3872000	Velvet Assassin that's gonna be coming out later on
3872000	3874000	I'm sorry, but they did that Pirates and Ninjas
3874000	3876000	Dodgeball game that was horrible
3876000	3878000	No, that's South Peak, yeah
3878000	3880000	South Peak did, I'm talking about Gamecock
3880000	3882000	I thought Gamecock did that game
3882000	3884000	No
3884000	3886000	I don't think they did
3886000	3888000	They're publishing it, whatever
3888000	3890000	They don't make the games, they just publish them
3890000	3892000	Yes
3892000	3894000	The Pirates and Ninjas Dodgeball
3894000	3896000	Maybe not exactly the glowing
3896000	3898000	Example of their portfolio
3898000	3900000	Legendary looked good
3900000	3902000	And Mushroom
3902000	3904000	Sort of okay, but there's
3904000	3906000	A lot more games they're putting out
3906000	3908000	And they're increasingly getting better
3908000	3910000	So that's nice
3910000	3912000	South Peak on the other hand, they've been releasing
3912000	3914000	Overlord
3914000	3916000	That's pretty cool
3918000	3920000	Overlord is pretty sweet
3920000	3922000	They had some other stuff, X-Planes
3922000	3924000	I think that was one of theirs as well
3924000	3926000	I wonder if Bang Mini
3926000	3928000	One of the first orders of business at South Peak
3928000	3930000	Is gonna be telling the guys at Gamecock to sit down
3930000	3932000	And shut up, cause you know, they're kinda
3932000	3934000	Known for just making a lot of noise, you know what I mean
3934000	3936000	They just make noise, and some people don't
3936000	3938000	Get it, like sometimes you kinda look at them and go
3938000	3940000	They're just kinda weird and need to shut up
3940000	3942000	I don't think that they're like
3942000	3944000	I get the sense Gamecock kinda runs
3944000	3946000	Themselves like a fraternity
3946000	3948000	And for real, I get the sense
3948000	3950000	That they have raging kegger parties at some of their
3950000	3952000	Company things, events, right
3952000	3954000	Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that
3954000	3956000	It seems like this giant gaming fraternity
3956000	3958000	And I'm sure it's a fun as hell place to work
3958000	3960000	But sometimes you look at that and go
3960000	3962000	Okay, they have to remember
3962000	3964000	That in every good frat party movie
3964000	3966000	That there's always a
3966000	3968000	Montage sequence where they have to pull it
3968000	3970000	Together and act a little bit less
3970000	3972000	Like a fraternity and more like
3972000	3974000	A brotherhood and actually come together and do business
3974000	3976000	Instead of just fuck around all the time
3976000	3978000	And they haven't really gotten to that point
3978000	3980000	In the grand scheme of things
3980000	3982000	Gameguru in chat wants to say
3982000	3984000	South Peak didn't have anything to do with
3984000	3986000	Pirates vs Ninjas Dodgeball, Gamecock published it though
3986000	3988000	I thought I saw their logo on that game
3988000	3990000	And I'm sorry
3990000	3992000	We talked about this, I think
3992000	3994000	Last week or two weeks ago when Dark Star Wars
3994000	3996000	Classic Game of the Week was the dodgeball game for Neo Geo
3996000	3998000	That I thought
3998000	4000000	The Pirates vs Ninja game was kind of assy
4000000	4002000	Compared to Neo Geo
4002000	4004000	I thought it was a dumb idea to begin with
4004000	4006000	Oh, Pirates vs Ninjas, we're gonna settle this match
4006000	4008000	Once and for all with Dodgeball
4008000	4010000	And I'm like, lame
4010000	4012000	Tune out
4012000	4014000	SSJ100Matt in chat says if Gamecock has
4014000	4016000	Kager parties, then OLR has pie parties
4016000	4018000	Not true, tonight is a flat fortune cookie party
4018000	4020000	Pancake cookie
4020000	4022000	And they taste like pancakes too
4022000	4024000	They're delish
4024000	4026000	They taste like yummy
4026000	4028000	Awesometasticness
4028000	4030000	Also pretty awesometastic
4030000	4032000	Is the game Soul Calibur 4
4032000	4034000	But what is less awesome
4034000	4036000	Is that we all saw this coming a mile away
4036000	4038000	They swore up and down
4038000	4040000	Oh yeah, Darth Vader, Yoda, exclusive
4040000	4042000	To their respective consoles
4042000	4044000	Even though there's that big gap in the character
4044000	4046000	List select screen
4046000	4048000	And there was video and screenshots of them playing
4048000	4050000	No, it's totally exclusive
4050000	4052000	Well, sure enough, they've confirmed this week
4052000	4054000	That due to
4054000	4056000	Overwhelming fan response
4056000	4058000	Mhm
4058000	4060000	That soon you will be able to download
4060000	4062000	Darth Vader and Yoda
4062000	4064000	In Xbox 360 and Playstation
4064000	4066000	Three, you know, the respective versions
4066000	4068000	That are missing it
4068000	4070000	You'll be able to download them on October 23rd
4070000	4072000	I'm not sure if that's a US or a Japanese date
4072000	4074000	But you know it's gonna happen everywhere
4074000	4076000	I mean, come on
4076000	4078000	October 23rd, you know that's almost exactly three months
4078000	4080000	From the game's release
4080000	4082000	What a coinkydink
4082000	4084000	You've had an exclusive deal for
4084000	4086000	Three months
4086000	4088000	It'll set you back $5
4088000	4090000	That's 400 Microsoft points
4090000	4092000	Or in Sony terms, $5
4092000	4094000	I'm sorry, in Sony terms, $4.99
4094000	4096000	So you have
4096000	4098000	Because Sony's not gonna like
4098000	4100000	Do anything with that extra penny
4100000	4102000	Yes, isn't that wonderful
4102000	4104000	You have to put full amounts
4104000	4106000	Full dollars into your account
4106000	4108000	But they charge you $4.99
4108000	4110000	So there's always a remainder
4110000	4112000	Oh, cry
4114000	4116000	You know, I'm a consumer whore
4116000	4118000	I'll probably get it anyway
4118000	4120000	Just charge even amounts, god, who cares
4120000	4122000	$4.99 may seem cheaper
4122000	4124000	But seriously, people know how to do math
4124000	4126000	They understand it's only one cent cheaper
4126000	4128000	I'm glad though
4128000	4130000	I can say I told you so, I told you so
4130000	4132000	To my friend that said I have to get the Playstation 3
4132000	4134000	Version of Soul Calibur because it's the only way I'll get to play
4134000	4136000	Vader, and secretly I think
4136000	4138000	He just wanted to play me online
4138000	4140000	And I'm like, just wait
4140000	4142000	There will be download content
4142000	4144000	It's inevitable, and I'll bet you what
4144000	4146000	You know what, I bet you money
4146000	4148000	I will bet you money, significant amount of money
4148000	4150000	This is not download content
4150000	4152000	It's pay to unlock content
4152000	4154000	Money
4154000	4156000	I posted a picture in the chatroom, by the way
4156000	4158000	Of the view from where I sit
4158000	4160000	Well, thank you for that
4160000	4162000	It's of Rob's head
4162000	4164000	Oh, great
4164000	4166000	And one of your pancake cookies
4166000	4168000	Speaking of yummy
4168000	4170000	Resistance 2
4170000	4172000	Kids like aliens
4172000	4174000	Kids should not be playing the game
4174000	4176000	Because it is mature
4176000	4178000	Oh
4178000	4180000	The beta
4180000	4182000	For Resistance 2
4182000	4184000	Began on Friday
4184000	4186000	So
4186000	4188000	For those who got in, let us know how it is
4188000	4190000	You know what you can tell us
4190000	4192000	Some opinion here or there
4192000	4194000	It's going to be
4194000	4196000	Going from
4196000	4198000	Actually
4198000	4200000	The 20th of October
4200000	4202000	So I guess actually that's
4202000	4204000	I'm sorry, that's in Europe
4204000	4206000	It's starting on Monday the 20th
4206000	4208000	And it's going to be going on until Thursday
4208000	4210000	The 13th of November
4210000	4212000	And there will be keys that are given out
4212000	4214000	From IGN, but there's no date
4214000	4216000	As to when those keys will be given out
4216000	4218000	So keep your eyes on IGN for
4218000	4220000	A little bit more on that
4220000	4222000	I like how the beta is going longer than actually the game
4222000	4224000	The game is coming out in the middle of the beta
4224000	4226000	That's the UK
4226000	4228000	Dates
4228000	4230000	Loki, you try to get into betas that you probably don't belong in
4230000	4232000	Are you going to get into this one?
4232000	4234000	I'm not even going to try
4234000	4236000	I didn't really play much
4236000	4238000	Actually, I didn't play any of the multiplayer
4238000	4240000	In Resistance 1
4240000	4242000	In fact, I sold my copy back
4242000	4244000	Yesterday
4244000	4246000	But you still enjoy the game, right?
4246000	4248000	Yeah, the game was awesome
4248000	4250000	And I will plan on getting it
4250000	4252000	I'll enjoy the game
4252000	4254000	I'll have to wait a few weeks
4254000	4256000	There you go
4256000	4258000	But, yeah
4258000	4260000	I don't know
4260000	4262000	The last few multiplayer betas I've been in
4262000	4264000	Call of Duty 4 didn't really play much
4264000	4266000	What else did I get in?
4266000	4268000	Battlefield Bad Company
4268000	4270000	I didn't even play that at all
4270000	4272000	I'm a horrible beta tester
4272000	4276000	For what it's worth, I played the Wrath of the Lich King beta once
4276000	4278000	I went through all that patching and all that crap to play it once
4278000	4280000	And that was it
4280000	4282000	Doesn't that mean you don't have to patch it later?
4282000	4284000	No, it was a completely separate thing
4284000	4286000	No, because you still have to buy the retail copy of it
4286000	4288000	And you know, they're going to change some things
4288000	4290000	From what was in the beta
4290000	4292000	Well, it's finally here
4292000	4294000	For those people clamoring to play
4294000	4296000	A translation of Mother 3
4296000	4298000	You can now download the patch
4298000	4300000	For your ROM
4300000	4302000	That you may have of Mother 3
4302000	4304000	Of course you would
4304000	4306000	Need to have an import copy of the game
4306000	4308000	Because, you know
4308000	4310000	To make it legit
4310000	4312000	You can now download the patch
4312000	4314000	The update, which has been worked on
4314000	4316000	For a while now
4316000	4318000	Is finally available
4318000	4320000	So that's pretty awesome now that you get to play
4320000	4322000	Mother 3, which, I don't know
4322000	4324000	I don't know why they don't just translate it
4324000	4326000	Seriously, why do they refuse
4326000	4328000	To put that game out over here?
4328000	4330000	I mean, it is literally
4330000	4332000	A refusal on Nintendo's part
4332000	4334000	To just put that game out here
4334000	4336000	And remember how
4336000	4338000	How long it
4338000	4340000	You know, the fans put effort into
4340000	4342000	Doing second to three and we never got it
4342000	4344000	So
4344000	4346000	It's just weird how adamant they are
4346000	4348000	I mean, I can't imagine it costs that much money
4348000	4350000	To translate, but maybe it's because then they have to
4350000	4352000	Produce the game, I don't know, it's just
4352000	4354000	It's just sad
4354000	4356000	And you look at some of the stuff that is coming out from Nintendo
4356000	4358000	On these systems and you just go, why?
4358000	4360000	Personal training cooking
4360000	4362000	That is awesome
4362000	4364000	Not only are they
4364000	4366000	Little behind in putting that out
4366000	4368000	Because there's going to be about four or five
4368000	4370000	Other cooking games coming out around the same time
4370000	4372000	I don't think anyone's going to buy it
4372000	4374000	I mean
4374000	4376000	I'm sure there's people out there that actually
4376000	4378000	Purchase every single Nintendo game that comes out
4378000	4380000	But, dude, seriously, you might start
4380000	4382000	Questioning that
4382000	4384000	Alright, one more story before we get to the classic
4384000	4386000	Game of the week and get to our break tonight
4386000	4388000	Hey ladies
4388000	4390000	If you're still looking for a Halloween costume
4390000	4392000	You know your gamer man
4392000	4394000	In your life might enjoy the sexy
4394000	4396000	Lingerie
4396000	4398000	With Ms. Pac-Man's likeness on it
4398000	4400000	It will look like that
4400000	4402000	Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are eating your boobies
4402000	4404000	Because that's what this bra looks like
4404000	4406000	Is that you actually have
4406000	4408000	Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man
4408000	4410000	Just click on the show roll link
4410000	4412000	And you can get this picture
4412000	4414000	But it looks, I mean, they're sexy little outfits
4414000	4416000	I get that
4416000	4418000	And I like how when the model
4418000	4420000	I don't know what you want to call it
4420000	4422000	Gladiator style skirt with little flaps
4422000	4424000	And if you lift up the flaps
4424000	4426000	It reveals Inky
4426000	4428000	One of the ghosts, or maybe it's Binky or Pinky
4428000	4430000	I don't know, but on your panties
4430000	4432000	Right where your cooter is
4432000	4434000	So, nice little surprise there
4434000	4436000	Like, ooh, ghost
4436000	4438000	And I would like to point out
4438000	4440000	That the ghost is blue
4440000	4442000	Which means it is an appropriate time
4442000	4444000	To munch it
4444000	4446000	For 200 points
4446000	4448000	Anyway
4448000	4450000	3wishes.com is where you can
4450000	4452000	Buy Ms. Video Game

4458000	4460000	Clicking on a linky
4460000	4462000	Are you going to be buying
4462000	4464000	Ms. Video Game for Dan this Halloween?
4464000	4466000	Not for Dan to wear, but for

4478000	4480000	Alright
4480000	4482000	Hell fuck yes, though, to the classic game of the week
4482000	4484000	Right, DarkSakura?
4484000	4486000	Hell fuck yes, let's check it out
4486000	4488000	We're going to travel gaming's history
4488000	4490000	To find a game that DarkSakura
4490000	4492000	Thinks you all should be playing
4492000	4494000	It's the classic game of the week
4494000	4496000	And I think this week's classic game of the week
4496000	4498000	Is probably one a lot of people have
4498000	4500000	Played, I'm guessing
4500000	4502000	If they haven't, they suck
4502000	4504000	Or maybe we're too young
4504000	4506000	To see it the first time
4506000	4508000	But you need to go find this game
4508000	4510000	Right, DarkSakura?
4510000	4512000	We can get it on PSP, shit
4512000	4514000	Alright, well, tell us about it
4514000	4516000	What is this week's classic game of the week?
4516000	4518000	We have two games, but they're together, one's a sequel
4518000	4520000	It's Parappa the Rapper
4520000	4522000	And Parappa the Rapper 2
4522000	4532000	Parappa
4532000	4534000	How do you not know this song?
4534000	4538000	Seriously, the demo came with what?
4538000	4540000	I think it was on one of the old Sony magazines
4540000	4544000	It was, and I played the fuck out of it?
4544000	4546000	Anyway
4546000	4548000	You basically play
4548000	4552000	It's all done in sort of a 2D flat style
4552000	4554000	For all the characters
4554000	4556000	And you play as a little dog named Parappa
4556000	4558000	Who has to believe, because I gotta believe
4558000	4560000	And basically
4560000	4562000	He goes around rapping
4562000	4564000	Against different people
4564000	4566000	So it's really a music rhythm game
4566000	4568000	It's like Simon Says, really
4568000	4570000	Where they, the words that
4570000	4572000	Whichever the masters that you're going against
4572000	4574000	Their words have a pattern of button presses
4574000	4576000	And then you have to repeat it for yours
4576000	4578000	Or do something that corresponds
4578000	4580000	That's actually more Parappa 2
4580000	4582000	And of course the better you do
4582000	4584000	The better your score
4584000	4586000	If you start sucking, then
4586000	4588000	You go to bad, you're not rapping cool
4588000	4590000	If you get from
4590000	4592000	Rapping good to rapping cool
4592000	4594000	Then the stage just completely goes off
4594000	4596000	And you take over and you just have to keep pressing buttons
4596000	4598000	Randomly until the stage is over
4598000	4600000	Which was actually the only way I passed the stage
4600000	4602000	From Jeremy Lammy, which we'll get to later
4602000	4604000	So
4604000	4606000	The game was made by
4606000	4608000	Masaya Matsura
4608000	4610000	Who was
4610000	4612000	Actually
4612000	4614000	One of the, the leader of the Hyperpop unit
4614000	4616000	For
4616000	4618000	But he was also, the company
4618000	4620000	That brought out the game was Nana Oncha
4620000	4622000	So
4622000	4624000	If anyone remembers
4624000	4626000	Nana Nana Nana Nana Oncha
4626000	4628000	I played this game literally a million times
4628000	4630000	And Unchan Malami
4630000	4632000	I love these games
4632000	4634000	You have the meter like I was saying before
4634000	4636000	You have the rapping good
4636000	4638000	That's when you're doing okay
4638000	4640000	When you're doing as you're expected to
4640000	4642000	If you're rapping bad, the music gets a little worse
4642000	4644000	If you're rapping awful, it's just
4644000	4646000	Depressing sounding
4646000	4648000	And the stage is rain
4648000	4650000	And it gets awful
4650000	4652000	And the better you do, it starts going back to normal again
4652000	4654000	You know, like you'll have this little
4654000	4656000	Minor, you know, chord
4656000	4658000	Baseline to it
4658000	4660000	So
4660000	4662000	The art was done by Rodney Greenblatt
4662000	4664000	And um
4664000	4666000	He's got a website that's just got
4666000	4668000	Tons of his art
4668000	4670000	But it also did have a sequel
4670000	4672000	Which we're getting to the music of next time
4672000	4674000	And we will hear the music from the sequel right now
4676000	4678000	Well this is just the start of it
4678000	4680000	This is from Parappa 2
4680000	4682000	I didn't put Unchan Malami in here
4682000	4684000	While even though it plays the same
4684000	4686000	It feels differently, I think, don't you agree?
4686000	4688000	Yeah, I mean it is a different game
4688000	4690000	It's like um
4690000	4692000	It's not a sequel but an equal, if that makes sense
4692000	4694000	Yeah, and um
4694000	4696000	Unchan Malami and friends make an appearance in this game
4696000	4698000	But I had to pick the best music in
4698000	4700000	Parappa 2
4700000	4702000	I think we get a cut scene with this one
4702000	4704000	I don't know if it goes straight into the song
4704000	4706000	Hey everybody, watch out for those flying noodles
4706000	4708000	Cause if you don't do well here
4708000	4710000	All you get to eat are noodles
4710000	4718000	And here we go
4728000	4730000	So you can find Sister Mustachio
4730000	4732000	I will
4732000	4734000	But anyway, the reason why I had to put Parappa 2 up on there
4734000	4736000	Is because the music is just
4736000	4738000	A lot better
4738000	4740000	Different styles
4740000	4742000	I really love the Parappa 2 soundtrack
4742000	4744000	And um
4744000	4746000	But I had to pick that particular level
4746000	4748000	Cause there's one stage where Parappa has to trap himself
4748000	4750000	In a video game or else everybody in the universe has to eat noodles forever
4750000	4752000	And that's
4752000	4754000	As far as I'll say without spoiling the rest of the story of the game
4754000	4756000	If you haven't played it
4756000	4758000	God knows why you haven't
4758000	4760000	But um
4760000	4762000	It also really goes there
4762000	4764000	A lot more stylistically
4764000	4766000	As far as having stages
4766000	4768000	Where you change perspective
4768000	4770000	Within your 3D environment
4770000	4772000	Like the
4772000	4774000	Ant guru
4774000	4776000	Or um
4776000	4778000	You know where you uh
4778000	4780000	That's the first Parappa
4780000	4782000	Oh I thought you wanted this movie show
4782000	4784000	The one from Parappa 2
4784000	4786000	What stage number was it?
4786000	4788000	4 I think
4788000	4790000	Well this is one of my favorite songs from Parappa
4790000	4798000	When I say boom boom boom
4798000	4800000	You say bam bam bam boom
4800000	4802000	When I say boom boom boom
4802000	4804000	I love this song
4804000	4806000	If you sort of freestyle a little bit with it
4806000	4808000	It increases your score
4808000	4810000	And if it's good enough
4810000	4812000	That shoots you into cool mode
4812000	4814000	Pretty much
4814000	4816000	You know so
4816000	4818000	Now going back to this I mentioned it before
4818000	4820000	Is um
4820000	4822000	That there is a PSP version
4822000	4824000	And I happen to look into my copy for about 13 bucks
4824000	4826000	When a Hollywood video
4826000	4828000	Is going out of business
4828000	4830000	Um
4830000	4832000	But uh
4832000	4834000	It's the same thing
4834000	4836000	You've got lots of different versus modes in it
4836000	4838000	Um jammerlami
4838000	4840000	We will definitely be
4840000	4852000	Yeah here's another one
4852000	4856000	And who can forget the bathroom rap in the first game?
4856000	4858000	God I know
4858000	4860000	Um especially as often as it's been quoted
4860000	4862000	Um
4862000	4864000	But this is why I think that um
4864000	4866000	Parappa 2 though
4866000	4868000	If you can just listen to the difference between
4868000	4870000	How much more complex the music is
4870000	4872000	I really like it a lot better personally
4872000	4874000	Um
4874000	4876000	Jammerlami was another
4876000	4878000	Game that's in the same vein
4878000	4880000	And I was saying I'll probably cover it
4880000	4882000	On another one because it honestly is
4882000	4884000	I think different enough
4884000	4886000	Within the style of music that it can qualify
4886000	4888000	As a different game
4888000	4890000	But there was Parappa mode in it
4890000	4892000	And Parappa mode was pretty freaking cool
4892000	4894000	Because it turned all these rocking songs into rap
4894000	4896000	Um
4896000	4898000	There are some differences
4898000	4900000	Um
4900000	4902000	A few lines that were changed
4902000	4904000	As far as
4904000	4906000	You know one released to the other
4906000	4908000	Um
4908000	4910000	There was an anime
4910000	4912000	A Parappa anime that I thought was really really cute
4912000	4914000	Um it came out
4914000	4916000	In Japan it actually has a really cool little intro song to it too
4916000	4918000	Um
4918000	4920000	But for anyone
4920000	4922000	When I was speaking about the uh
4922000	4924000	Um
4924000	4926000	I was talking to a guy named Rodney Greenblatt
4926000	4928000	His uh website
4928000	4930000	Is um
4930000	4932000	Wednesdayload.com
4932000	4934000	W-H-I-M-S-Y
4934000	4936000	Load L-O-A-D dot com
4936000	4938000	That's all one word dot com
4938000	4940000	Um and
4940000	4942000	While his artwork may seem fairly simplistic
4942000	4944000	He's got some really nice and complex stuff on there
4944000	4946000	Uh some uh
4946000	4948000	Uh sculpture
4948000	4950000	Um different uh
4950000	4952000	You know medium he uses
4952000	4954000	Work you know
4954000	4956000	Given you know my recent educational career
4968000	4970000	I know all the lyrics to these today
4970000	4972000	I remember driving around San Francisco one time after
4972000	4974000	Picking up somebody and um
4974000	4976000	He had brought the CD and we listened to it
4976000	4978000	In the Rain or in the Snow
4978000	4980000	Um
4980000	4982000	We've often referred to as um
4984000	4986000	The After Effects of certain
4986000	4988000	Eating at Gem Boys as
4988000	4990000	The Funky Flow
4990000	4992000	Nice
4992000	4994000	Um really not joking
4994000	4996000	But um
4996000	4998000	That's their game
4998000	5000000	Parappa and Parappa 2
5000000	5002000	There you go here classic game of the week
5002000	5004000	Parappa the Rappa and it's sequel Parappa the Rappa 2
5004000	5006000	Two for the price of one
5006000	5008000	I couldn't mention one without mentioning the other
5008000	5010000	Right it's like a necessity
5010000	5012000	Personally I like the second
5012000	5014000	Parappa better
5014000	5016000	As a game and music wise
5016000	5018000	But you cannot mention the second
5018000	5020000	One without mentioning the one that started
5020000	5022000	At all right you know
5022000	5024000	You sure cannot alright there you have it
5024000	5026000	Your classic game of the week and that means it's break
5026000	5028000	Time folks and when we come back we haven't even
5028000	5030000	Really touched a lot of the Microsoft news going on in the world
5030000	5032000	Microsoft might be giving out
5032000	5034000	Some free memory cards
5034000	5036000	Soon so we're going to be talking about that when we come back
5036000	5038000	From this break and some other stuff
5038000	5040000	Including that story I referenced a little bit earlier
5040000	5042000	About something in a game that pisses me off a little bit
5042000	5044000	And this is something
5044000	5046000	We actually found ourselves
5046000	5048000	Here at Orange Lounge Radio you will not have read about
5048000	5050000	This on any blogs yet
5050000	5052000	Kind of some I guess you could say exclusive news
5052000	5054000	But I don't like using that term it's just kind of one of those
5054000	5056000	You may not have heard of this yet
5056000	5058000	We'll be talking about it in part B when we come back
5058000	5068000	After this break
5088000	5098000	Orange Lounge Radio
5098000	5100000	Hail to the king baby
5100000	5102000	Hey welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio
5102000	5104000	And thanks J-Rod for that new little commercial there
5104000	5106000	I love it when other people do the commercials for us
5106000	5108000	If you have a promo you want to run for your
5108000	5110000	Nonprofit website or if you have a
5110000	5112000	Podcast you want to plug that's independent
5112000	5114000	You can always send us a commercial
5114000	5116000	Or if you just want to do something cool for Orange Lounge Radio
5116000	5118000	Like J-Rod did
5118000	5120000	You can put that together and send it to us
5120000	5122000	At Orange Lounge Radio there's more information available on the forums
5122000	5124000	Meanwhile we're coming back to our show
5124000	5126000	After a pretty fun first half
5126000	5128000	Which I must say for this show
5128000	5130000	Was surprisingly intelligent
5130000	5132000	Considering we were talking about the Quran
5132000	5134000	And the controversy around the little big planet
5134000	5136000	And all that
5136000	5138000	I think we're pretty smart
5138000	5140000	So this is the Oscar clip
5140000	5142000	Tonight's episode
5142000	5144000	Episode number 299
5144000	5146000	It's going to be a big show next week
5146000	5148000	Hey that fart over there must be
5148000	5150000	Mean that Fart Princess
5150000	5152000	Is joining us here in studio
5152000	5154000	Who just surprised us
5154000	5156000	By joining us during the break I had no idea you were coming tonight
5156000	5158000	Hi Fart Princess how are you?
5158000	5160000	Hi I was just supplementing the Oscar material
5160000	5162000	Oh thank you
5162000	5164000	And by the way she's no longer Rice Princess
5164000	5166000	She's Fart Princess
5166000	5168000	You're a liar
5168000	5170000	And also joining us tonight
5170000	5172000	I haven't seen you in a long time
5172000	5174000	Now what are we calling you these days?
5174000	5176000	It used to be Casper the Gay
5176000	5178000	But I now go by The Doctor
5178000	5180000	Now The Doctor
5180000	5182000	I've got a Sonic Screwdriver right here
5182000	5184000	Oh and our guests are extremely loud tonight
5184000	5186000	I'm very sorry
5186000	5188000	I left mine at home
5188000	5190000	I'll adjust the volume
5190000	5192000	As we move in
5192000	5194000	We actually have a listener called The Doctor too
5194000	5196000	And now there's going to be some confusion
5196000	5198000	Let me see your Sonic Screwdriver
5198000	5200000	You've got the little one?
5200000	5202000	It's not Sonic then
5202000	5204000	No but after the show
5204000	5206000	I'm going to play with Captain Jack's Sonic Screwdriver
5206000	5208000	Oh my
5208000	5210000	Oh my
5210000	5212000	You know that's actually what I was planning on doing for Halloween
5212000	5214000	Is getting a blue suit
5214000	5216000	And tie and wearing my con verses
5216000	5218000	And going as Chick Doctor
5218000	5220000	Oh my god that'd be so awesome and then we would match
5220000	5222000	Because I'm going to be Doctor Who as well
5222000	5224000	I've got the black ones
5224000	5226000	I was actually either going to do the blue suit
5226000	5228000	Or do a different color suit and be Chick Doctor
5228000	5230000	That'd be so awesome
5230000	5232000	It's nice to have guests in the studio it's been a long time
5232000	5234000	Especially considering episode 300 of this program
5234000	5236000	If you can believe it is next week
5236000	5238000	Oh my
5238000	5240000	Yeah episode 300 is next week
5240000	5242000	Oh my
5242000	5244000	And we're doing nothing special for it except soliciting congratulations
5244000	5246000	And whatever memories from our listeners
5246000	5248000	On 877 Game OLR when we're not live
5248000	5250000	You should do something special
5250000	5252000	We might do some games next week
5252000	5254000	So you kids should come back
5254000	5256000	So there you have it
5256000	5258000	This is some gaming news if you guys want to comment on the news
5258000	5260000	You have a microphone feel free to comment
5260000	5262000	Just refrain from fart noises fart princess
5262000	5264000	Do we need more fart noises?
5264000	5266000	Alright
5266000	5268000	I love that I come back from break
5268000	5270000	And talk about what an intelligence show we're having tonight
5270000	5272000	And then fart princess shows up
5272000	5274000	To fuck the whole thing up
5274000	5276000	What are you talking about?
5276000	5278000	What?
5278000	5280000	What?
5280000	5282000	What?
5282000	5284000	What?
5284000	5286000	We have to go from extremes
5286000	5288000	We have to keep the listeners guessing
5288000	5290000	And Rob?
5290000	5292000	There's the show I was missing somehow
5292000	5294000	And Rob?
5294000	5296000	Yeah great
5296000	5298000	Oh how much lower can we go? Yes
5298000	5300000	Did you ever see that skit on the state where they had the high brow side
5300000	5302000	And the low brow side
5302000	5304000	Shifting over to the low brow side
5304000	5306000	I think I vaguely remember yes
5306000	5308000	The state was a cool show
5308000	5310000	I had the guy who had to put his balls and stuff
5310000	5312000	Can we get back to the news please?
5312000	5314000	No we're supposed to make the show crappy now
5314000	5316000	Loki some gaming news for the love of god
5316000	5318000	So yes
5318000	5320000	There is this rumor
5320000	5322000	Going around that the next
5322000	5324000	Xbox system
5324000	5326000	Will be forwards compatible
5326000	5328000	Yeah I know you've heard
5328000	5330000	All about backwards compatibility
5330000	5332000	Oh but we got the brand new forwards
5332000	5334000	Compatibility
5334000	5336000	It will play the games of the future
5336000	5338000	No really what it means is it will
5338000	5340000	And I think this technology is already available now
5340000	5342000	It will make your Xbox
5342000	5344000	360 games better
5344000	5346000	Same you know either at a higher
5346000	5348000	Resolution or
5348000	5350000	Make them play smoother
5350000	5352000	I don't know like the Playstation
5352000	5354000	Isn't that the exact same fucking thing
5354000	5356000	The 360 was supposed to do to original
5356000	5358000	Xbox games? And it does to a certain
5358000	5360000	Extent it does you know
5360000	5362000	Smooth out the graphics a little bit
5362000	5364000	And it also
5364000	5366000	You know kind of up rezzes it
5366000	5368000	A little bit same with the Playstation 2
5368000	5370000	It kind of made it a little bit smoother
5370000	5372000	Decreased loading times
5372000	5374000	Depending on which option you chose
5374000	5376000	So how is this any different
5376000	5378000	Than backwards compatibility? In fact I would say
5378000	5380000	It's exactly the same as backwards compatibility
5380000	5382000	Just with a different name to it
5382000	5384000	Because obviously your Xbox 360 is not going to be able to play
5384000	5386000	New games
5386000	5388000	I don't know I'll tell you the last system that had
5388000	5390000	True forwards compatibility was the Dreamcast
5390000	5392000	And I'll tell you why
5392000	5394000	Because with every new game
5394000	5396000	They would load a new version of Windows CE
5396000	5398000	That would have an improved running environment
5398000	5400000	For each game that came out subsequent
5400000	5402000	So in that respect
5402000	5404000	That's forward compatibility
5404000	5406000	We haven't had a system do that since
5406000	5408000	But it's also firmware updates
5408000	5410000	And you know they have those
5410000	5412000	Available now and you know with
5412000	5414000	Each firmware update it could make your
5414000	5416000	System run smoother
5416000	5418000	Isn't it just a bunch of
5418000	5420000	Marketing mumbo jumbo?
5420000	5422000	It is a bunch of marketing mumbo jumbo and rumor
5422000	5424000	Marketing mumbo jumbo might I add
5424000	5426000	So who cares
5426000	5428000	The system isn't going to be out for a while
5428000	5430000	Anyways and we'll listen to all the marketing
5430000	5432000	Mumbo jumbo when that actually happens
5432000	5434000	Moral of the story?
5434000	5436000	Sega is awesome
5436000	5438000	I'm not sure how we got to that but okay
5438000	5440000	Dreamcast
5440000	5442000	Let's read some comments from chat
5442000	5444000	Our first half of the show tonight was missing
5444000	5446000	Too much of the chat room. Let's get some comments from chat
5446000	5448000	Make up for it part B here
5448000	5450000	Redertainment says forwards compatibility sounds like
5450000	5452000	New things can be promoted and such
5452000	5454000	Backwards compatibility sounds old and dated
5454000	5456000	So like with forwards compatibility
5456000	5458000	Yoda and Vader will already be unlocked
5458000	5460000	Is that what it is?
5460000	5462000	Maybe?
5462000	5464000	You don't even know what the hell I'm talking about
5464000	5466000	I'm sorry we're like acting right now
5466000	5468000	Alright
5468000	5470000	By the way if you're not watching Justin TV
5470000	5472000	All rice princess and the doctor
5472000	5474000	Are doing are beating each other up on cam
5474000	5476000	For your entertainment so check that out
5476000	5478000	That's all we're doing
5478000	5480000	Hey I want to talk about a little bit of news
5480000	5482000	And actually this might be something you guys might have an opinion on
5482000	5484000	I don't know and this is not out there yet
5484000	5486000	This news is not out there yet
5486000	5488000	This actually was my buddy Shane
5488000	5490000	You know he's been on the show here before
5490000	5492000	Plenty of times he actually works at a game store
5492000	5494000	And he sent me a picture
5494000	5496000	From a strategy guide coming out for Fable 2
5496000	5498000	And it's the Brady Games
5498000	5500000	Strategy guide for Fable 2
5500000	5502000	And there's a section in it that talks about clothing
5502000	5504000	There are plenty of quality
5504000	5506000	Tailors scattered throughout the cities of
5506000	5508000	Albion and most of them are
5508000	5510000	I'm sorry and each of them are
5510000	5512000	Cable of crafting some fine handmade clothing
5512000	5514000	Etc, etc, etc. Let me get to this part
5514000	5516000	Many items are unisex
5516000	5518000	But those that are designed
5518000	5520000	Specifically for one sex
5520000	5522000	Carry a cross-dressing rating
5522000	5524000	Should the other sex wear them
5524000	5526000	Heroes wishing to experiment with gender
5526000	5528000	Play should consider wearing up
5528000	5530000	Clothes of the opposite gender
5530000	5532000	Especially if looking to start a same
5532000	5534000	Sex relationship
5534000	5536000	Interesting
5536000	5538000	So that's what I can infer from this
5538000	5540000	From the strategy guide
5540000	5542000	Is that in Fable 2
5542000	5544000	If you want to start a same sex relationship
5544000	5546000	Because you know the game will allow you to basically
5546000	5548000	Have whatever types of relationships you want
5548000	5550000	The way to do that is by cross-dressing
5550000	5552000	You have to trick them
5552000	5554000	Apparently
5554000	5556000	That's wrong
5556000	5558000	That's crazy
5558000	5560000	This is what I was talking about in the first half
5560000	5562000	Where even I looked at this and I went
5562000	5564000	Okay I'm a little bit offended by this
5564000	5566000	Because we've been trying to combat
5566000	5568000	For years and years and years
5568000	5570000	When they splash images of the pride parade on the news
5570000	5572000	And that's what people think
5572000	5574000	The culture is all about
5574000	5576000	Well some of us don't even like that kind of stuff
5576000	5578000	And it's like
5578000	5580000	Nobody applies logic
5580000	5582000	It's like you're gay and you like men
5582000	5584000	Not women
5584000	5586000	Hello
5586000	5588000	That's like the epitome of being gay
5588000	5590000	Hello
5590000	5592000	And maybe I'm just being a little hypersensitive about this
5592000	5594000	And letting the trigger figure go off
5594000	5596000	Too soon on this and being offended
5596000	5598000	But I'm just kind of like come on people
5598000	5600000	Is this really the way the game
5600000	5602000	Has to be designed is that if I want to impress
5602000	5604000	People of the same gender I have to cross-dress
5604000	5606000	I'm sure the designers will come back and say
5606000	5608000	Well you don't have to cross-dress
5608000	5610000	You don't have to do it
5610000	5612000	But I'm sure it improves your chances and to me that's wrong
5612000	5614000	Yeah no and it's just
5614000	5616000	I'm not mad about it
5616000	5618000	Yeah it's dumb
5618000	5620000	That's what people think though because it's like
5620000	5622000	This one girl in a club was like
5622000	5624000	Oh do you wear panties and I'm like
5624000	5626000	I'm not a woman
5626000	5628000	I don't wear panties
5628000	5630000	No that's what they make mantis for
5630000	5632000	Yeah maybe mantis
5632000	5634000	Well it's
5634000	5636000	For all we know
5636000	5638000	And I don't know how much further
5638000	5640000	Into the strategy guide he looked at it
5640000	5642000	It could be possible
5642000	5644000	That maybe it's just a small
5644000	5646000	No apparently later in the guide
5646000	5648000	Each article of clothing
5648000	5650000	Is actually has like a cross-dress rating
5650000	5652000	Okay
5652000	5654000	So cross-dressing is a facet of the game
5654000	5656000	And I don't know if it's the guide
5656000	5658000	I don't know if it's the game
5658000	5660000	I'm assuming the guide is just reporting on how the game was designed
5660000	5662000	You know what I mean but that sentence to me
5662000	5664000	Stings the way they say that
5664000	5666000	Is that if you want to improve your chances
5666000	5668000	In a same-sex relationship you gotta cross-dress
5668000	5670000	Then make it sound like that's an integral part of it
5670000	5672000	Reddertainment in chat says
5672000	5674000	Can I attract people of the opposite gender while cross-dressing
5674000	5676000	Dude I know in real life
5676000	5678000	There's a lot of women that do find that hot actually
5678000	5680000	Hell yeah
5680000	5682000	A man who's comfortable with their sexuality
5682000	5684000	All the teenage guys that go to cosplay dressed as like Japanese school girls
5684000	5686000	Like I'm sure there's a lot of chicks there
5686000	5688000	That get off on that
5688000	5690000	I almost became a cosplay stalker
5690000	5692000	Because of this one guy dressed as Utena
5692000	5694000	There you go
5694000	5696000	And he looked freaking gorgeous
5696000	5698000	I was like I'm gonna follow you now
5698000	5700000	Oh my
5700000	5702000	AcidicVampire in chat says
5702000	5704000	At least you can have a same-sex relationship in The Sims
5704000	5706000	Exactly I think The Sims is a game that does it right
5706000	5708000	The game is not about
5708000	5710000	Same-sex relationships
5710000	5712000	The game does not force you to do same-sex relationships
5712000	5714000	It's just there
5714000	5716000	Just like in real life
5716000	5718000	Or like in Bully
5718000	5720000	In Bully you have to dress up a little bit
5720000	5722000	You have to wear your aqua-weary vest to get a kiss from a guy
5722000	5724000	But that's not too bad
5724000	5726000	Well at that point it was just like
5726000	5728000	We'll take what we can get
5728000	5730000	Sauce brought up Manfay
5730000	5732000	And she can
5732000	5734000	She can put Manfay right away
5734000	5736000	Nobody is attracted to Manfay
5736000	5738000	Okay that's
5738000	5740000	You don't want to know
5740000	5742000	The doctor just asked what is Manfay
5742000	5744000	Did you watch Cowboy Bebop?
5744000	5746000	No he doesn't
5746000	5748000	Don't even bring up the picture please
5748000	5750000	Rob do it
5750000	5752000	We need a reaction shot
5752000	5754000	This is radio
5754000	5756000	Can you describe what Manfay is while I pull up the picture in chat here
5756000	5758000	The character Fay in Cowboy Bebop
5758000	5760000	Has been cosplay
5760000	5762000	Yes a woman
5762000	5764000	Has been cosplayed
5764000	5766000	By many pretty women
5766000	5768000	And one hairy man
5768000	5770000	That is Manfay
5770000	5772000	Rob share the picture in the chat room please
5774000	5776000	Sailor Bubba is a close second
5776000	5778000	Oh yeah, oh god
5778000	5780000	Shut her
5780000	5782000	There you have it
5786000	5788000	I've been at conventions
5788000	5790000	Where Manfay has been present
5790000	5792000	And see look look
5792000	5794000	Manfay we're all sitting here and laughing at
5794000	5796000	And that's why I don't like this in the game
5796000	5798000	Because we sit there and laugh at crossdressers
5798000	5800000	I don't know
5800000	5802000	And I don't think that should be associated with same sex
5802000	5804000	This one person is
5804000	5806000	It's crossplay
5806000	5808000	Crossplay I like that
5808000	5810000	I know plenty of female cosplayers
5810000	5812000	Who do male characters
5812000	5814000	To comedic effect
5814000	5816000	And that's hot
5816000	5818000	Sometimes
5818000	5820000	I've even considered doing a couple of costumes myself
5820000	5822000	I wanted to go as Richter one year
5822000	5824000	You know with the Ryu hairband look
5824000	5826000	And everything
5826000	5828000	But you know I have a friend of mine who's very tall
5828000	5830000	Who went as
5830000	5832000	Larva from Vampire Princess Mio
5832000	5834000	So
5834000	5836000	Alright Shauran in chat says
5836000	5838000	My friend saw Manfay at her first con
5838000	5840000	I feel so bad for her
5840000	5842000	Alright getting away from Manfay and all this funny stuff
5842000	5844000	For right now
5844000	5846000	We were talking about the other story
5846000	5848000	You know it's hard for me to sit here and go
5848000	5850000	People should not find this offensive
5850000	5852000	When in the same breath I'm looking at this story
5852000	5854000	And I'm going you know what I'm kind of sort of offended
5854000	5856000	At this story
5856000	5858000	I think it's different though
5858000	5860000	It is but I can't put my finger on it
5860000	5862000	Why should I be offended
5862000	5864000	The difference being is that
5864000	5866000	This is a specific component
5866000	5868000	Integral to the game
5868000	5870000	This is something programmed specifically
5870000	5872000	Into the game
5872000	5874000	As a facet of gameplay
5874000	5876000	The other is background music
5876000	5878000	That was made
5878000	5880000	By someone of that faith
5880000	5882000	It's
5882000	5884000	Now if that had been programmed in by
5884000	5886000	The most flaming of all gay people ever
5886000	5888000	Would you be as offended
5888000	5890000	Yes
5890000	5892000	Because I think that person should know better
5892000	5894000	Okay but if that person
5894000	5896000	Personally thought it was
5896000	5898000	Funny and wondered why people would be offended
5898000	5900000	I mean I'm not like offended
5900000	5902000	Offended is not the word
5902000	5904000	I'm disappointed
5904000	5906000	I'm disappointed that it's 2008
5906000	5908000	And this is what I'm reporting on
5908000	5910000	Is that cross-dressing in the game will help your chance
5910000	5912000	With same sex relationships
5912000	5914000	Can't we just move on
5914000	5916000	Why can't it just be
5916000	5918000	If this game wants to be so big
5918000	5920000	You have the character you want
5920000	5922000	And you program the same way
5922000	5924000	Why can't you just be
5924000	5926000	Why can't you just be the hero
5926000	5928000	With muscles and I don't know
5928000	5930000	Whatever wearing manly clothes
5930000	5932000	That attracts a lot of women
5932000	5934000	And 10% of men
5934000	5936000	You know what I mean
5936000	5938000	Why can't we just have that
5938000	5940000	You know what I think it should be
5940000	5942000	And keep in mind also
5942000	5944000	Not everyone who cross-dresses
5944000	5946000	Is gay
5946000	5948000	We know this
5948000	5950000	Not everyone who
5950000	5952000	Who is gay cross-dresses
5952000	5954000	Also importantly true
5954000	5956000	Exactly and there are people
5956000	5958000	Who want to be that gender
5958000	5960000	I think that if they were
5960000	5962000	Going to incorporate something like that in the game
5962000	5964000	And true it would be some very
5964000	5966000	Complex programming I do believe
5966000	5968000	It should be
5968000	5970000	That you have the option of how you are going
5970000	5972000	To make use of that option
5972000	5974000	You know what I mean
5974000	5976000	If you want to cross-dress because you want to be a woman
5976000	5978000	You should have that as an option
5978000	5980000	I want boobs
5980000	5982000	Solid Goomba in chat says I want to be a man
5982000	5984000	In a dress and have a relationship with a woman
5984000	5986000	More power to you
5986000	5988000	I do think the game should allow that
5988000	5990000	If that's what you want
5990000	5992000	You know what I mean I don't think cross-dressing should have a bearing on it
5992000	5994000	I don't know maybe I'm just
5994000	5996000	Maybe I just need to cool it but it just seems a little silly to me
5996000	5998000	And you know if the designers
5998000	6000000	Take issue with how I'm reporting on that
6000000	6002000	Well look at the strategy guy the official strategy guy for the game
6002000	6004000	That's where it comes from
6004000	6006000	I agree that's boring
6006000	6008000	It's like oh my god we got another flamer
6008000	6010000	Is the gay character in the game you know I don't know
6010000	6012000	People need to get on with it
6012000	6014000	I'm just kind of getting sick of it
6014000	6016000	Like one of these days I would just like to have
6016000	6018000	A normal person
6018000	6020000	Who happens to be gay in my video game
6020000	6022000	Just like you know in TV and all that
6022000	6024000	You know and even if sexuality
6024000	6026000	Is not a part of the game's device at all
6026000	6028000	Then fine we have no defined sexuality
6028000	6030000	In the game that's just fine by me
6030000	6032000	But amongst these RPG love stories I would like
6032000	6034000	One day for there to be
6034000	6036000	A same gender one that is not stupid
6036000	6038000	If that makes sense
6038000	6040000	And you know that actually
6040000	6042000	Goes back to what I was talking about
6042000	6044000	About the sort of
6044000	6046000	A
6046000	6048000	Singular directional bigotry
6048000	6050000	You know what I mean
6050000	6052000	I think that
6052000	6054000	Every you know
6054000	6056000	Every relationship is going to have its moments
6056000	6058000	Of dysfunction
6058000	6060000	Every relationship is you know some may have
6060000	6062000	A very odd origin you know
6062000	6064000	I ordered my husband on the internet
6064000	6066000	You know
6066000	6068000	I think that
6068000	6070000	It doesn't have a quirk to it
6070000	6072000	The quirk should be there because of the people involved
6072000	6074000	Not because of their orientation
6074000	6076000	Right
6076000	6078000	Um
6078000	6080000	Just one other thing though
6080000	6082000	I think though that having
6082000	6084000	An active
6084000	6086000	You know I don't even think it should be
6086000	6088000	An active choice I think you should just
6088000	6090000	Start up your character and be born gay or not
6090000	6092000	Because really isn't that
6092000	6094000	For the most part you know
6094000	6096000	I think it's genetic
6096000	6098000	Progress
6098000	6100000	I think that
6100000	6102000	As far as it being a part that does
6102000	6104000	Determine a lot of who your character
6104000	6106000	Is
6106000	6108000	But it does not
6108000	6110000	Define who your character is
6110000	6112000	Um let me read some comments in chat here real quick
6112000	6114000	Because they're good
6114000	6116000	Acidic vampire says play indigo prophecy
6116000	6118000	There's a normal quote unquote
6118000	6120000	Gay male in it
6120000	6122000	And no I haven't and that's one of those Xbox games
6122000	6124000	That like I should have played but I never did
6124000	6126000	Fair but you know I guess maybe we
6126000	6128000	Need a little more of that
6128000	6130000	SG100Matt says I'm still waiting on a video game
6130000	6132000	Hero who happens to be Jewish
6132000	6134000	Fair enough
6134000	6136000	But how often does religion come into video games
6136000	6138000	Of course then again
6138000	6140000	Saying all that with what we talked about earlier
6140000	6142000	But you know just
6142000	6144000	And then immediately follows
6144000	6146000	That up and says just because they always grab coins
6146000	6148000	Doesn't mean they're Jewish
6148000	6150000	See
6150000	6152000	I like that you can have a little fun with it
6152000	6154000	Alright
6154000	6156000	Look let's just move on
6156000	6158000	And you know everybody's talking about
6158000	6160000	They want to see representation of themselves
6160000	6162000	GS68 I want more Filipino
6162000	6164000	Filipina characters dammit
6164000	6166000	I'm sure there's a lot of people saying I want to see a little more
6166000	6168000	Of this in games so maybe it's time
6168000	6170000	For diversity the game
6170000	6172000	I don't know it's a small world the game
6172000	6174000	Who knows I don't know
6174000	6176000	Let's move on there's plenty more gaming news to talk about
6176000	6178000	If you want to talk more about it email us
6178000	6180000	Call us later
6180000	6184000	Take us to a game that has nothing to do with sexuality, religion or race at all
6184000	6186000	This one's about falling into holes
6186000	6188000	That could be construed as sexuality
6188000	6192000	Yeah but how many holes do people really fall into
6192000	6194000	I tripped there's a vagina
6194000	6196000	You might wake up with a hangover
6196000	6198000	I think I fell into a hole while I was drunk
6198000	6200000	Anyway sorry go ahead
6200000	6202000	Okay anyway
6202000	6204000	Portal Still Alive
6204000	6206000	Is going to be on the Xbox Live arcade
6206000	6208000	It will be
6208000	6210000	It will
6210000	6212000	Be up on Wednesday October 22nd
6212000	6214000	And
6214000	6216000	It has the
6216000	6218000	One that came out
6218000	6220000	Earlier
6220000	6222000	Plus 14 new exclusive
6222000	6224000	Challenge maps
6224000	6226000	And 6 advanced maps
6226000	6228000	And new achievements
6228000	6230000	So in other words if you bought the orange box
6230000	6232000	Just for this game
6232000	6234000	Haha sucker you're going to buy it twice
6234000	6236000	But is Portal a game that you really
6236000	6238000	Mind buying twice I mean it is pretty freaking good
6238000	6240000	There are different levels to be fair
6240000	6242000	Yeah to be fair I know
6242000	6244000	There needs to be more GLaDOS
6244000	6246000	On the PC
6246000	6248000	First there will be cake and then you will be baked
6248000	6250000	There's no story in the extra levels right?
6250000	6252000	They're just kind of there
6252000	6254000	It's just more crazy
6254000	6256000	Will you be taunted by GLaDOS in these bonus levels or are they just extra puzzles or something?
6256000	6258000	What's the point of not being taunted?
6258000	6260000	I don't know
6260000	6262000	That's why I'm curious to see like
6262000	6264000	How
6264000	6266000	How milked is this game?
6266000	6268000	That's what I want to see like are they really just milking it
6268000	6270000	Or did they actually put a little thought into it?
6270000	6272000	That's what I'm really curious to see
6272000	6274000	Who knows
6274000	6276000	Well
6276000	6278000	One thing that you can probably store that brand new game on
6278000	6280000	Would be a hard drive
6280000	6282000	Or a new memory unit
6282000	6284000	And remember Microsoft was saying with the new
6284000	6286000	Xbox experience
6286000	6288000	That you would need some sort of storage
6288000	6290000	Device in order to download it because it does take
6290000	6292000	128 megs of space
6292000	6294000	Well their solution
6294000	6296000	For people that
6296000	6298000	I don't know how they went about
6298000	6300000	Existing with an Xbox with no storage whatsoever
6300000	6302000	Because that means you can't save games or anything
6302000	6304000	They are offering
6304000	6306000	A free 512 megabyte memory unit
6306000	6308000	Or for 20 bucks
6308000	6310000	You can buy a 20 gigabyte hard drive
6310000	6312000	Now in order to qualify for this
6312000	6314000	You have to have a core system
6314000	6316000	Or some arcade systems
6316000	6318000	May qualify as well
6318000	6320000	Basically just go to their
6320000	6322000	Website
6322000	6324000	They have available for that
6324000	6326000	Which is xbox.com
6326000	6328000	Go to their support page
6328000	6330000	And there is a memory update thing
6330000	6332000	Where you enter your serial number and console ID
6332000	6334000	Into the program
6334000	6336000	And if you are eligible
6336000	6338000	Let you buy them
6338000	6340000	If you are not eligible and you happen to have an arcade system
6340000	6342000	That's the other option
6342000	6344000	For $29.99 you can get a 20 gig hard drive
6344000	6346000	And a 3 month live card
6346000	6348000	Which is not a bad deal either
6348000	6350000	Now my question
6350000	6352000	When I got my xbox 360
6352000	6354000	I have a core
6354000	6356000	Because I got my system during that time
6356000	6358000	When xbox 360s were really hard to find
6358000	6360000	So I just ponied up the 20 extra dollars
6360000	6362000	Or whatever it was to buy the hard drive
6362000	6364000	And the core system separately
6364000	6366000	So is Microsoft going to know that I have had a hard drive this whole time
6366000	6368000	Or do you think you will qualify for this
6368000	6370000	Sweet! I get a free memory card
6370000	6372000	Right?
6372000	6374000	Awesome!
6374000	6376000	I'm good! Why not? It's free!
6376000	6378000	Microsoft doesn't know that I have a hard drive
6378000	6380000	And even though I do
6380000	6382000	Why should I be treated differently
6382000	6384000	From the other owners that bought the core
6384000	6386000	Early on, early adopters
6386000	6388000	Yeah!
6388000	6390000	For 20 bucks you can get a 20 gig hard drive
6390000	6392000	That could just be the drive I install
6392000	6394000	Final Fantasy XI on and never use
6394000	6396000	Or it could be
6396000	6398000	Or better yet
6398000	6400000	Because I only have a 20 gig hard drive as it is now
6400000	6402000	I could have two drives and one of them
6402000	6404000	Can be like the movies drive
6404000	6406000	Or it could be the games drive
6406000	6408000	Why not?
6408000	6410000	To be honest, I think that's an awesome solution
6410000	6412000	For their problem
6412000	6414000	And really, I mean
6414000	6416000	Who would not have a hard drive
6416000	6418000	Or a memory unit
6418000	6420000	I mean, seriously, I could see some people that may have
6420000	6422000	Only a 64 megabyte memory unit
6422000	6424000	Say they bought it back when the
6424000	6426000	Xbox 360 came out and stuff
6426000	6428000	And they're only using it for, say, save games
6428000	6430000	But, I mean
6430000	6432000	I can't imagine someone that would have
6432000	6434000	An Xbox 360 that actually plays games
6434000	6436000	That you have to progress in
6436000	6438000	That does not have a way to save their game
6438000	6440000	Because that would be kind of retarded
6440000	6442000	You have to start over every time
6442000	6444000	I didn't even know they made Xboxes without memories
6444000	6446000	Well, they don't anymore
6446000	6448000	I have several people telling me in chat and
6448000	6450000	Aim and everywhere that, hey, Microsoft's gonna hear
6450000	6452000	What you just said and you're screwed
6452000	6454000	But, actually, it may even be before that
6454000	6456000	No, it's not
6456000	6458000	Henderson Man in chat says, Sky, I have a core
6458000	6460000	But it would not let me have a free memory card
6460000	6462000	That's from Henderson Man in chat
6462000	6464000	I don't think it's gonna, eh
6464000	6466000	Now I'm really curious, I'm gonna try it
6466000	6468000	I'll let you guys know what happens next week
6468000	6470000	Well, I've got about five different ones we can try
6470000	6472000	We'll see what happens
6472000	6474000	I do, actually, I want to get a bigger hard drive
6474000	6476000	But if I can get a 20 gig hard drive
6476000	6478000	Another one for cheap, I'll do that switch out idea
6478000	6480000	I think it's a great idea
6480000	6482000	So, we'll see
6482000	6484000	Anyhow, thank you, Microsoft
6484000	6486000	For giving us some free stuff
6486000	6488000	Right?
6488000	6490000	Alright, moving on to some more news
6490000	6492000	And talking about the Xbox 360
6492000	6494000	A little further, and the Zune
6494000	6496000	I don't know how many folks out there actually own Zunes
6496000	6498000	I know it's got a loyal following
6498000	6500000	There's a few people out there that own the Zunes
6500000	6502000	But, you know, they're
6502000	6504000	They're trying to increase
6504000	6506000	The amount of flexibility that
6506000	6508000	Or, I should say, compatibility that occurs between the two
6508000	6510000	You know, with the media sharing
6510000	6512000	And, you know, the things that go on between the 360 and the Zune
6512000	6514000	Well, actually, recently
6514000	6516000	Some folks were
6516000	6518000	Over at Gizmodo were talking about the new Gears of War
6518000	6520000	Zune that's coming out
6520000	6522000	And they were actually talking to Microsoft's marketing director
6522000	6524000	And the marketing director
6524000	6526000	Was talking about that there is going to be a big
6526000	6528000	Step up
6528000	6530000	Happening in the Zune 360 integration within
6530000	6532000	A year
6532000	6534000	So, that's all, it's a very vague statement
6534000	6536000	But that supposedly
6536000	6538000	It's going to step it up within a year
6538000	6540000	Any thoughts as to what that could possibly be?
6540000	6542000	Well, they already have the XNA
6542000	6544000	Support that's supposed to be coming to it
6544000	6546000	They're going to flesh that out a little bit more
6546000	6548000	And maybe it would be kind of cool
6548000	6550000	They actually put some games on there
6550000	6552000	Like, you know, they could even be like
6552000	6554000	The Pocket Station stuff where you play a little mini game
6554000	6556000	You earn points for a game or something
6556000	6558000	I have a thought, and I bet money I'm right
6558000	6560000	Movies
6560000	6562000	You're going to be able to play movies on the Zune that you bought on Xbox
6562000	6564000	I could see that happening
6564000	6566000	It's going to be how they're going to compete with iPod
6566000	6568000	Rob
6568000	6570000	Remember when they were talking about the Zune E3?
6570000	6572000	Right
6572000	6574000	Didn't they bring up something to that effect
6574000	6576000	That it would be like a multi-entertainment
6576000	6580000	I remember going in there with my camera
6580000	6582000	And them telling me to turn it off
6582000	6584000	At the Xbox 360 thing
6584000	6586000	And they were talking about having portable content
6586000	6588000	So perhaps this is what they intended
6588000	6592000	Cobra Kid says more XNA games to it in chat
6592000	6594000	That's true, they have that whole XNA thing coming out soon
6594000	6596000	That could be a big part of it too
6596000	6598000	So maybe it's all of it
6598000	6600000	It could be just as much as the iPhone interfaces
6600000	6602000	With your Mac or even your personal computer
6602000	6604000	Maybe the Zune will interface with the Xbox 360
6604000	6606000	Who knows
6606000	6608000	Will there be enough people that use it
6608000	6610000	Or just a quick question in chat
6610000	6612000	Let's say the Zune could do all of those things you suggested
6612000	6614000	Let's say the Zune can do the XNA games
6614000	6616000	Let's say the Zune can do the movies
6616000	6618000	And all that stuff
6618000	6620000	Would you be interested in a Zune chat room
6620000	6622000	As opposed to an iPhone
6622000	6624000	Or any of the other stuff that's out there
6624000	6626000	Let's say you can only have one player
6626000	6628000	Would you pick Zune
6628000	6630000	Comment from Tigerclaw
6630000	6632000	Tigerclaw says doesn't the Zune have built in Wi-Fi
6632000	6634000	They could make apps for it
6634000	6636000	Like for example someone would eventually make an internet radio app
6636000	6638000	To tune into the shotcast streams over the Wi-Fi
6638000	6640000	We'll see
6640000	6642000	We'll come back to that story
6642000	6644000	Just after we get this next story out of the way
6644000	6646000	This actually makes me a little bit happy
6646000	6648000	Even though I already own the game
6648000	6650000	On multiple platforms
6650000	6652000	Marvel vs Capcom 2
6652000	6654000	Which
6654000	6656000	Honestly I thought the first one was a little bit better
6656000	6658000	But um
6658000	6660000	It actually has an ESRB rating now
6660000	6662000	For PS3 and Xbox 360
6662000	6664000	So that leads speculation
6664000	6666000	That it's going to be a
6666000	6668000	Downloadable version
6668000	6670000	Maybe like a
6670000	6672000	Xbox Live Arcade
6672000	6674000	Or something like that
6674000	6676000	And that's pretty cool
6676000	6678000	I mean it's a good game
6678000	6680000	So I'm looking forward to that
6680000	6682000	It's a fucking awesome game you mean
6682000	6684000	By good
6684000	6686000	It's all about
6686000	6688000	Playing a Strider hear you anyway
6688000	6690000	Okay looking at chatroom comments
6690000	6692000	From the last story because we asked you guys would you get one
6692000	6694000	And would you get a Zune if they
6694000	6696000	Implemented all these features
6696000	6698000	VxJsonXV says Zunes blow
6698000	6700000	Rama says yes
6700000	6702000	GameGuru says maybe but I'm more interested in PSP right now
6702000	6704000	Sharan says sure why not
6704000	6706000	VxJsonXV continues I have my iPhone
6706000	6708000	And I'm happy with it
6708000	6710000	Redertainment says does it do much better than my current touch
6710000	6712000	If not no I need a gross incentive to jump over
6712000	6714000	That's how I feel
6714000	6716000	There's got to be something really big to get me to have a Zune
6716000	6718000	As well as an iPhone
6718000	6720000	Cobra Kid says I would have to get a bigger Zune
6720000	6724000	Deekman says I'm telling you they'll merge the music card and the gamer tag
6724000	6726000	I didn't even think of that
6726000	6728000	That could be so we'll see
6728000	6730000	Alright
6730000	6732000	So Marvel vs Capcom 2 hopefully coming soon
6732000	6734000	As it says
6734000	6736000	Meanwhile some other news
6738000	6740000	Right Loki?
6740000	6742000	Sorry someone was stepping on my mic
6742000	6744000	Are our guests being unruly?
6744000	6746000	They are being very unruly
6746000	6748000	They need to be punished
6748000	6750000	We're playing naughty tic tac toe
6750000	6752000	Anyways
6752000	6754000	If you live in Europe you're going to
6754000	6756000	Be in for a lot of holiday bundles
6756000	6758000	For the Xbox 360
6758000	6760000	They are getting quite a few
6760000	6762000	In fact starting
6762000	6764000	Well last week actually
6764000	6766000	The value packs that are available
6766000	6768000	Pretty much all around the world
6768000	6770000	Are available for them as well
6770000	6772000	That includes of course the games packed in
6772000	6774000	Lego Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda
6774000	6776000	For both the Elite and Pro
6776000	6778000	And the Sega Superstar Tennis
6778000	6780000	And of course the Xbox Live arcade games
6780000	6782000	Starting
6782000	6784000	Looks like
6784000	6786000	November 7th
6786000	6788000	They're going to be getting two more bundles
6788000	6790000	Both with the 60GB Pro system
6790000	6792000	And either Gears of War 2 bundled in
6792000	6796000	Or James Bond 007 Quantum of Solus bundled in
6796000	6798000	And those are going to both be available
6798000	6800000	For 269 euros
6800000	6802000	Starting
6802000	6804000	The 21st of November
6804000	6806000	There's going to be another one with
6806000	6808000	Tomb Raider Underworld
6808000	6810000	And that's also a Pro system
6810000	6812000	The 60GB with a 1200
6812000	6814000	Microsoft points card
6814000	6816000	And that's also available for 269 euros
6816000	6818000	And then finally
6818000	6820000	The Last Stitch effort before Christmas
6820000	6822000	There's another 60GB Pro system
6822000	6824000	Bundled with
6824000	6826000	Prince of Persia
6826000	6828000	And that will also be for 269 euros
6828000	6830000	So
6830000	6832000	A little bit more expensive than your normal games
6832000	6834000	Your normal Lake Pro system
6834000	6836000	I mean
6836000	6838000	Basically you're kind of paying for the game itself
6838000	6840000	Anyways
6840000	6842000	But hey that's kind of neat
6842000	6844000	I guess if you're shopping for the holidays
6844000	6846000	Lots and lots to pick from
6846000	6848000	Why do you think so many bundles over there
6848000	6850000	Are supposed to here?
6850000	6852000	I think it may have been just
6852000	6854000	And I'm not even sure if it's actually
6854000	6856000	It could very well be
6856000	6858000	Like different
6858000	6860000	Say bundles that are being
6860000	6862000	Done by retailers and stuff like that
6862000	6864000	I don't know if these are official
6864000	6866000	Or what the case may be
6866000	6868000	I don't know it's interesting
6868000	6870000	I guess
6870000	6872000	Alright well hey one game that they aren't
6872000	6874000	Bundling in right now is Castle Crashers
6874000	6876000	Maybe someday
6876000	6878000	Some people will tell you Castle Crashers is still borked
6878000	6880000	That it's online multiplayer mode is still
6880000	6882000	Not that great and we've been waiting and waiting
6882000	6884000	And waiting for a patch well
6884000	6886000	Guess what Behemoth the developer of the game
6886000	6888000	Has just posted on their site this week that
6888000	6890000	They have figured out how to fix the problem
6890000	6892000	They have finished the patch and it is
6892000	6894000	Currently waiting on certification
6894000	6896000	For Microsoft I'm sorry they are currently verifying
6896000	6898000	The updates and then they're going to be sending it off to Microsoft
6898000	6900000	For certification which has probably
6900000	6902000	Already happened
6902000	6904000	Kind of took them long enough in a way
6904000	6906000	I mean with as long as this game took
6906000	6908000	To come out I mean couldn't they just kind of like
6908000	6910000	Fix this before it came out
6910000	6912000	I mean I don't know I guess you know they didn't know
6912000	6914000	They tested the game they didn't find it
6914000	6916000	Mistakes happened blah blah blah
6916000	6918000	But it's a little bit frustrating this game has been out how long
6918000	6920000	And you still can't really have a multiplayer game on it
6920000	6922000	But I guess to their credit
6922000	6924000	You know a lot of people bought this game anyway
6924000	6926000	And hearing about this patch is just going to cause
6926000	6928000	Another wave of people
6928000	6930000	Running out to get this game
6930000	6932000	Whereas a lot of Xbox Live Arcade titles kind of have
6932000	6934000	One shot the week they come out
6934000	6936000	And then they kind of slip into obscurity
6936000	6938000	Maybe it was pre-planned who knows
6938000	6940000	I doubt it though
6940000	6942000	Alright
6942000	6944000	Well something pre-planned on Orange Lounge Radio is that
6944000	6946000	Every week we are going to take some time to read your
6946000	6948000	Emails that you send us to mailbag at
6948000	6950000	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
6950000	6952000	Why are you boycotting the mailbag?
6952000	6954000	I will get you a damn cookie if you read the emails
6954000	6956000	Hey FartPrincess
6956000	6958000	Doctor do you guys want
6958000	6960000	I have flat fortune cookies
6960000	6962000	They taste like pancakes
6962000	6964000	Oh my
6964000	6966000	Well Dark Soccer reads us some email
6972000	6974000	There is an email that I should have sent in response
6974000	6976000	To you directly Rob
6976000	6978000	And I don't know if I should read it on air
6978000	6980000	Well if you read this first
6980000	6982000	Then I am going to have to wait on the cookies
6982000	6984000	Okay you can just read it at your leisure
6984000	6986000	Well give me a brief idea of what it's about
6986000	6988000	It's from Spazinator
6988000	6990000	Hi
6990000	6992000	Telling you what games you should get for PS3
6992000	6994000	Oh

6996000	6998000	About something like I need more
6998000	7000000	Games that I should
7000000	7002000	What games?

7010000	7012000	Everyday Shooter, Super Puzzle Fight
7012000	7014000	Are you farting glasses?
7014000	7016000	What are you doing?
7016000	7018000	Knock it off
7018000	7020000	Trying to do a show
7020000	7022000	Wait did they just list
7022000	7024000	Every game that's not
7024000	7026000	A list of 36 games Rob
7026000	7028000	Just basically all the PS3 exclusives
7028000	7030000	Some
7030000	7032000	Some are not
7032000	7034000	To be fair I am going to get a PS3
7034000	7036000	LittleBigPlanet is out
7036000	7038000	Sooner rather than later
7038000	7040000	There is more tips on what else you should get along with
7040000	7042000	And what you should look for
7042000	7044000	I am having surgery soon
7044000	7046000	So you know
7046000	7048000	Probably having a blu-ray player will be a good thing
7048000	7050000	As they recover
7050000	7052000	So let's go on to the next email
7052000	7054000	While I go get the cookies
7054000	7056000	The next email
7056000	7058000	Is actually from
7058000	7060000	Did you lose a sock?
7060000	7062000	No I know where my socks are
7062000	7064000	Cookie!
7064000	7066000	Bye

7070000	7072000	Heart
7072000	7074000	We love you
7074000	7076000	So excited for the cookies
7076000	7078000	Okay
7078000	7080000	Never mind I was told not to
7080000	7082000	Read this email on the air
7082000	7084000	So I've already addressed this situation
7084000	7086000	Multiple times before
7086000	7088000	So stop reminding me I know
7088000	7090000	Heart
7092000	7094000	And then
7098000	7100000	We only really have one other email
7102000	7104000	And it's actually
7104000	7106000	From
7106000	7108000	Dan Shadow
7108000	7110000	Hey guys my nephew's birthday
7110000	7112000	Was last week so I missed the show
7112000	7114000	Took him to the movie of his choice
7114000	7116000	And he chose, wait for it, quarantine
7116000	7118000	Yeah it sucked so bad
7118000	7120000	I mean it was so bad
7120000	7122000	That people would start talking during the movie and no one
7122000	7124000	Cared, fucking rabies
7124000	7126000	Anyways
7126000	7128000	Been trying to catch up on my OLR since I had
7128000	7130000	To leave in the middle of another episode
7130000	7132000	Just got one episode on Friday
7132000	7134000	And I'm sure
7134000	7136000	I guess you meant to have the word
7136000	7138000	Rob
7138000	7140000	I'm on the last email
7140000	7142000	Rob's gay

7148000	7150000	I recommend it to anyone who has a good
7150000	7152000	Sound setup
7152000	7154000	Thank you, ooh cookie
7154000	7156000	It's not as scary visually
7156000	7158000	As much as it is audibly
7158000	7160000	The visuals are great
7160000	7162000	They're just not as scary as the
7162000	7164000	EA's, as EA's been telling all of us
7164000	7166000	Man can you believe the news this week
7166000	7168000	LittleBigPlanet gets delayed, Ghostbusters gets
7168000	7170000	Picked back up and Obama's appearing in video games
7170000	7172000	Didn't a caller bring that up a few weeks ago
7172000	7174000	Oh and before I forget
7174000	7176000	Ballhair says hi
7176000	7178000	He's got a last name now and he's doing well
7178000	7180000	He's got a guild and we're at guild level 14
7180000	7182000	At this moment
7182000	7184000	And we're talking keeps
7184000	7186000	And we're taking keeps
7186000	7188000	Is it Ballhair Jenkins? Oh wait no
7188000	7190000	Ballhair was a Warhammer character right?
7190000	7192000	Yeah I'm looking
7192000	7194000	Ballhair Trimmer
7194000	7196000	The Dawnbringer
7196000	7198000	Nice
7198000	7200000	Ballhair Trimmer
7200000	7202000	That's lovely
7202000	7204000	And Ballhair got a guild
7204000	7206000	Congratulations
7206000	7208000	That's it for email?
7208000	7210000	We have one from
7210000	7212000	Entertainment
7212000	7214000	Less email, more cookie? Oh yes
7214000	7216000	One more email
7216000	7218000	I mean this is actually in response
7218000	7220000	But we were cc'd on this so I'm gonna read it
7220000	7222000	Alright
7222000	7224000	I brought, this is from Entertainment
7224000	7226000	I bought LittleBigPlanet
7226000	7228000	On Friday
7228000	7230000	And found out about the recall right before I sent this message
7230000	7232000	What the expletive deleted
7232000	7234000	For Bobby fuck for OLR should I do?
7234000	7236000	Should I contact Sony
7236000	7238000	Wait for a patch or keep the game as
7238000	7240000	A collector's item and buy another copy?
7240000	7242000	Thank you for your time
7242000	7244000	Entertainment
7244000	7246000	Yes that's an awesome idea, let's call Sony
7246000	7248000	And tell them not only did you break street on the game
7248000	7250000	He didn't break street, the person that sold it
7250000	7252000	Broke street
7252000	7254000	Keep it
7254000	7256000	And then buy another one
7256000	7258000	Keep it, collector's item, maybe the serial number or something will be different
7258000	7260000	Do not open it
7260000	7262000	Yeah well he probably already did because he didn't know about the
7262000	7264000	Change
7264000	7266000	Just hang on to it, Sony's gonna patch it out
7266000	7268000	Anyway so you're not gonna really have a choice
7268000	7270000	Cause they're doing both but
7270000	7272000	The serial number on that box will make
7272000	7274000	It's gonna be like those pennies that have
7274000	7276000	Like the misprint on the back
7276000	7278000	You know those type of things, that's what it's gonna be
7278000	7280000	If you wanna play your copy
7280000	7282000	That's been unedited then
7282000	7284000	Just come in from the internet
7284000	7286000	Yeah entertainment's in chat right now
7286000	7288000	It says he already opened it cause how would he know
7288000	7290000	That it was gonna be recalled so
7290000	7292000	Can't say I blame you there
7292000	7294000	Alright let's get back, if that's it for Mailbag
7294000	7296000	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com
7296000	7298000	While we chow down on cookies
7298000	7300000	Loki the cookie hater
7300000	7302000	Here's one more thing
7302000	7304000	Ow I hit myself in the face with the microphone
7304000	7306000	Was that the thing?
7306000	7308000	You know what Rob
7308000	7310000	One thing that I
7310000	7312000	Every so often will get an email on
7312000	7314000	And I'm meant to plug it during my classic game
7314000	7316000	Of the week
7316000	7318000	Was a review done by
7318000	7320000	Sauce
7320000	7322000	Oh yes I was reading about this on Twitter
7322000	7324000	And I am getting the link now
7324000	7326000	Cause if you go to Twitter.com
7326000	7328000	Slash Mar and Marvel there is a link to it
7328000	7330000	And her review of
7330000	7332000	The week is Actraiser
7332000	7334000	For classic game review
7334000	7336000	I know isn't it great
7336000	7338000	We just had an exclamation of
7338000	7340000	I love Actraiser
7340000	7342000	So go look at it I'm linking it in the chatroom
7342000	7344000	And I'll link it on our Twitter
7344000	7346000	Irene's god name in Actraiser
7346000	7348000	Is Poop
7348000	7350000	Oh Actraiser I love Actraiser
7350000	7352000	How funny that's what I named Link
7352000	7354000	In Legend of Zelda was Poop
7354000	7356000	Wow copycat
7356000	7358000	I named him GGG cause I was lazy
7358000	7360000	Nice
7360000	7362000	I named him Zelda so I could get the extra
7362000	7364000	No I'm kidding
7364000	7366000	Back to news cookie hater
7366000	7368000	Okay
7368000	7370000	Well there is some controversy
7370000	7372000	Around another game Saints Row 2
7372000	7374000	Apparently New York
7374000	7376000	Police unions condemn Saints Row 2
7376000	7378000	Because well you kill policemen
7378000	7380000	In the game
7380000	7382000	And according to them
7382000	7384000	New York's powerful police unions say that
7384000	7386000	A violent video
7386000	7388000	Or a violent new video game called Saints Row 2
7388000	7390000	Is an abomination
7390000	7392000	In the game the players control a gang member
7392000	7394000	Who can steal do drugs
7394000	7396000	Kill as many characters as possible
7396000	7398000	Including police officers
7398000	7400000	Well you said it right there
7400000	7402000	They're killing everybody so you know what
7402000	7404000	I'm pissed off at Saints Row 2
7404000	7406000	Because they're killing doctors
7406000	7408000	And prostitutes
7408000	7410000	And college students
7410000	7412000	And cookies
7412000	7414000	Do unions for college students coming out
7414000	7416000	You know
7416000	7418000	I'm a college student and I'm offended
7418000	7420000	Or taxi drivers
7420000	7422000	Or rednecks
7422000	7424000	Do unions for students exist
7424000	7426000	They have the student union
7426000	7428000	I guess that makes sense huh
7428000	7430000	The whole thing is just like
7430000	7432000	Okay this doesn't take place in New York
7432000	7434000	So
7434000	7436000	God yeah
7436000	7438000	Because you know what before this game
7438000	7440000	No one's ever thought hey you know what
7440000	7442000	We can kill cops in it
7442000	7444000	This is the first game to ever do that
7444000	7446000	Thank you for pointing this out
7446000	7448000	This also I might add
7448000	7450000	Comes from
7450000	7452000	WPEC
7452000	7454000	News 12 now
7454000	7456000	As you know
7456000	7458000	They're a CBS affiliate
7458000	7460000	And I would assume
7460000	7462000	The New York area
7462000	7464000	But I could be wrong
7464000	7466000	Redertainment in chat says I'm mad because they can kill
7466000	7468000	Redheaded dorks
7468000	7470000	Me too I should be angered about that too
7470000	7472000	Actually
7472000	7474000	So is the doctor he's waving his hand over there I'm pissed too
7476000	7478000	Yeah I don't even know where the hell this
7478000	7480000	Takes place it's somewhere on the east coast
7480000	7482000	That this um
7482000	7484000	Actual uh newscast is from
7484000	7486000	To which the legend of Zaku
7486000	7488000	Promptly follows up and says yay I didn't know
7488000	7490000	You can kill gingers in the game
7490000	7492000	Like it's incentive to buy it now
7494000	7496000	Oh gingers
7496000	7498000	Alright
7498000	7500000	Oh North Carolina
7500000	7502000	Not even close
7502000	7504000	Rama in chat says news channel 12 is a local
7504000	7506000	Cable news network
7506000	7508000	I don't know
7508000	7510000	Alright well look um
7510000	7512000	This kind of just dumbass-edness
7512000	7514000	Always brings on our FUs of the week
7514000	7516000	And especially since Saints Row
7516000	7518000	Is a game that Loki loves and adores
7518000	7520000	How dare the police department condemn it
7520000	7536000	You can condemn it all they want
7536000	7538000	Dark Sakura FUs of the week
7538000	7540000	The election season
7540000	7542000	All of it
7542000	7544000	And um
7544000	7546000	Sarah Palin for thinking she's funny
7546000	7548000	Loki
7548000	7550000	Um
7550000	7552000	God I had something early
7552000	7554000	That I was mad at about
7554000	7556000	But I don't remember so
7556000	7558000	FU to news 12
7558000	7560000	Because they have
7560000	7562000	Looks like a
7562000	7564000	Cast of douchebags that run this thing
7564000	7566000	They're all kind of ugly in weird ways
7566000	7568000	Um
7568000	7570000	My FU of the week goes to still not having
7570000	7572000	Like a solid date for my surgery
7572000	7574000	Like I think I know when it's gonna be
7574000	7576000	But because some people haven't gotten to my
7576000	7578000	Paperwork I only kind of know that it's
7578000	7580000	Probably gonna be not
7580000	7582000	This coming week but the next week
7582000	7584000	So there you go
7584000	7586000	Uh fart princess do you have any FUs of the week?

7610000	7612000	It's like a gauntlet you go through town and there's about
7612000	7614000	70,000 of them
7614000	7616000	I already went off on Prop 8 last week
7616000	7618000	So fuck you to everyone in Amador

7624000	7626000	I already voted and I voted no
7626000	7628000	Absentee
7628000	7630000	Fart princess do you have any real
7630000	7632000	FUs?

7642000	7644000	I agree with you ferret
7644000	7646000	The ferret is saying to vote no on 8 as well
7646000	7648000	Exactly
7648000	7650000	Alright let's get back into some gaming news
7650000	7652000	Sellers of Catan you guys know this game from
7652000	7654000	Xbox Live or you probably know the original board game
7654000	7656000	Hello
7656000	7658000	It kind of broke
7658000	7660000	I found some walls when it came to Xbox Live arcade
7660000	7662000	Because it was the first, besides Uno
7662000	7664000	It was the first really in depth board game
7664000	7666000	To really come out
7666000	7668000	On Xbox Live and that was really cool
7668000	7670000	But now it's not gonna stop there
7670000	7672000	Sellers of Catan is coming out on the Nintendo DS
7672000	7674000	As well
7674000	7676000	It's actually gonna be a version of a mobile
7676000	7678000	Game that's coming out called
7678000	7680000	Catan the first island but of course
7680000	7682000	The graphics and such will be much better than they are on mobile
7682000	7684000	So there's even a trailer up for it
7684000	7686000	On YouTube and you can take a look at it
7686000	7688000	And of course if you don't know what Catan is
7688000	7690000	It's a game about bartering and trading
7690000	7692000	It's kind of like Civilization and board game format
7692000	7694000	Except it made no sense to me
7694000	7696000	When I tried to learn how to play it
7696000	7698000	But I have a limited attention span for these types of things
7698000	7700000	What? I was more of a Carcassonne fan
7700000	7702000	What? Exactly
7702000	7704000	Who? Yep, you got it
7704000	7706000	What about carcasses? No
7706000	7708000	Just no
7708000	7710000	How about games we do understand
7710000	7712000	Games where we just shoot and kill things
7712000	7714000	Well kind of sorta
7714000	7716000	We have ratings
7716000	7718000	For the ESRB for stuff to come out on Virtual Console
7718000	7720000	And that would be
7720000	7722000	Metal Slug 2
7722000	7724000	You can ride a camel in it
7724000	7726000	And the camel has a gatling gun
7726000	7728000	Watch out, they spit
7728000	7730000	This one spits bullets
7730000	7732000	Out of his hip
7732000	7734000	Awesome
7734000	7736000	Best camel ever
7736000	7738000	The other game is
7738000	7740000	A boy and his blob
7740000	7742000	Trouble on Blobolonia
7742000	7744000	This is a DS version that was supposed to come out
7744000	7746000	Did it ever come out?
7746000	7748000	I don't think it ever did actually
7748000	7750000	It never came out
7750000	7752000	Maybe the publisher went under, I don't know
7752000	7754000	Get those jelly beans ready
7754000	7756000	Jelly beans
7756000	7758000	That's it
7758000	7760000	Nobody gets that
7760000	7762000	You have to feed him jelly beans
7762000	7764000	No, I get that
7764000	7766000	It may actually have come out
7766000	7768000	I'm looking, there's a little review
7768000	7770000	Here
7770000	7772000	It's actually come out
7772000	7774000	I'm looking here to see
7774000	7776000	Oh no, it was cancelled
7776000	7778000	They had a box art and everything
7778000	7780000	And the release was cancelled
7780000	7782000	That's sadness
7782000	7784000	It didn't really peak my interest anyway
7784000	7786000	When we went to E3 and we saw it
7786000	7788000	Rob, that makes my heart hurt
7788000	7790000	I know, it makes my heart hurt too
7790000	7792000	But we have a new one coming out
7792000	7794000	Well the Virtual Console one
7794000	7796000	Yeah, that's ok
7796000	7798000	It's the same damn game I've already played
7798000	7800000	I should just play the Nintendo
7800000	7802000	Before we get back into some news
7802000	7804000	I want to take a little detour because you guys got to the show late
7804000	7806000	You didn't get to talk about your gaming week
7806000	7808000	But you were telling me, Fart Princess
7808000	7810000	That there was a game you wanted to talk about
7810000	7812000	Yes, there is
7812000	7814000	I've been playing Hello Kitty online
7816000	7818000	For real, this isn't a joke
7818000	7820000	No, why would it be a joke?
7820000	7822000	There really is a Hello Kitty online?
7822000	7824000	Yeah, didn't you see that person
7824000	7826000	Post a link in your livestream?
7826000	7828000	Yes, but it's for the sake of the radio
7828000	7830000	Rob, I'd appreciate it if you stopped farting
7830000	7832000	That's really rude
7832000	7834000	Shut up and tell us about the game
7834000	7836000	No, I haven't checked it out
7836000	7838000	Tell us about the game, what do you do in the game?
7838000	7840000	Do you get to play as Hello Kitty?
7840000	7842000	No, you play as a boy or a girl character
7842000	7844000	Do you have a mouth?
7844000	7846000	I don't remember
7846000	7848000	I think you do
7848000	7850000	I'm pretty sure you have a butt too
7850000	7852000	You can like
7852000	7854000	You're interrupting me, Rob
7854000	7856000	What?
7856000	7858000	What's so funny?
7858000	7860000	Nothing, go ahead
7860000	7862000	Rob!
7862000	7864000	Jeez, Rob, close your eyes
7864000	7866000	Knock it off, gaming news
7866000	7868000	I'm not going to let you talk about Hello Kitty
7868000	7870000	If you don't get to it
7870000	7872000	Hello farty
7872000	7874000	You level the traditional sense of an MMO
7874000	7876000	But there's no
7876000	7878000	You can't kill anything in the game
7878000	7880000	Unless you fart on it
7880000	7882000	The way you level in the game is
7882000	7884000	Fatal flatulence
7884000	7886000	Yes, that's totally it
7886000	7888000	You forage for stuff
7888000	7890000	Like you gather plants and stuff
7890000	7892000	And then when you eat it, you go
7892000	7914000	That was a long fart
7914000	7916000	Wow, that took all of my breath
7916000	7918000	My butt breath
7918000	7920000	Your butt breath?
7920000	7922000	You're derailing the show, Rob
7922000	7924000	And you fight enemies too
7924000	7926000	But you don't kill them
7926000	7928000	Are they giant enemy crabs?
7928000	7930000	They are, they're crabs
7930000	7932000	Or do they just give you crabs?
7932000	7934000	They might do that too
7934000	7936000	They might also give you gas
7936000	7938000	Like
7938000	7940000	Stop it, Rob
7940000	7942000	New from Squeenix, fatal flatulence
7942000	7944000	And that's basically
7944000	7954000	The gist of the game
7954000	7956000	Look what you did, Rob
7956000	7958000	You should be ashamed of yourself
7958000	7960000	Now I'm thinking there actually should be a game
7960000	7962000	Called Hello Farty
7962000	7964000	Alright, stop it
7964000	7966000	People in the chatroom are complaining about their speakers
7966000	7972000	They should be complaining about the smell
7972000	7974000	Can we get on to some gaming?
7974000	7976000	I thought I would actually learn something about Hello Kitty
7976000	7978000	I told you about it, all about it
7978000	7980000	You just farted a lot
7980000	7982000	You didn't even listen
7982000	7984000	SSJ100Matt says Rob's gonna write a hate letter to the show
7984000	7986000	That is true
7986000	7988000	Uh, Loki
7988000	7990000	I'm gonna make sure that before the podcast goes out
7990000	7992000	We strip out all the fart noises
7992000	7994000	Then it wouldn't make sense
7994000	7996000	We're gonna patch it for day one release
7996000	7998000	So that anybody who does obtain the podcast early
7998000	8000000	Does not get to hear the fart noises
8000000	8002000	I'm gonna be replaced with birds chirping
8002000	8004000	Aw, that'd be great
8004000	8006000	Then we'd be giggling at birds chirping
8006000	8008000	Alright
8008000	8010000	I'm gonna be Hello Birdy
8010000	8012000	How about Rock Band?
8012000	8014000	How about Rock Band?
8014000	8016000	Rock Band 2 is coming to the Wii in November
8016000	8018000	And with it
8018000	8020000	All the features that you love in Rock Band 2
8020000	8022000	On the other platforms
8022000	8024000	Including, you will be able to download
8024000	8026000	The Rock Band 1 tracks
8026000	8028000	As well when they become available
8028000	8030000	And also
8030000	8032000	That the Guitar Hero 3 controller
8032000	8034000	Will work with the game now
8034000	8036000	So that's kinda cool
8036000	8038000	And of course any additional download content will be available
8038000	8040000	On the network as well
8040000	8042000	And you can store them on your SD memory card
8042000	8044000	So that's kinda cool
8044000	8046000	Sweet
8046000	8048000	I played a demo of this and dare I say
8048000	8050000	I pwned at the drums
8050000	8052000	Good
8052000	8054000	Because I suck at drums
8054000	8056000	So we should start a band
8056000	8058000	Wait, so you have Rock Band on the Wii?
8058000	8060000	No, but they had a demo
8060000	8062000	Oh, I see
8062000	8064000	So you haven't really played Rock Band
8064000	8066000	You've been in a Best Buy band
8066000	8068000	Alright
8068000	8070000	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about Wii Music
8070000	8072000	The other type of band game
8072000	8074000	Wii Music is doing very well in Japan
8074000	8076000	I know it's been getting a little bit of negative press around the fan
8076000	8078000	Well actually
8078000	8080000	Here's what I'm curious about
8080000	8082000	Doctor
8082000	8084000	You're a big giant Nintendo whore
8084000	8086000	Like you love everything Nintendo
8086000	8088000	Now we're kinda not feeling Wii Music
8088000	8090000	Nope
8090000	8092000	By Wii
8092000	8094000	He means himself
8094000	8096000	And Loki
8096000	8098000	I would like to point out that Dark Saga has said she wouldn't pay for it
8098000	8100000	No
8100000	8102000	I might have paid for it if I didn't know I was getting one for free
8102000	8104000	Anyhow
8104000	8106000	The Doctor
8106000	8108000	Are you interested in Wii Music at all?
8108000	8110000	Why not?
8110000	8112000	I am the biggest Nintendo
8112000	8114000	And I'm just like
8114000	8116000	I'm kinda bored with these completely novelty games
8116000	8118000	Like
8118000	8120000	You know, there's so many cool things
8120000	8122000	That they could do on the Wii
8122000	8124000	And they're just not
8124000	8126000	And I'm just like, okay, here's another game
8126000	8128000	Where you get to wave the Wii mode around
8128000	8130000	And I'm just like, ugh
8130000	8132000	Alright, well guess what
8132000	8134000	The country of Japan disagrees with us
8134000	8136000	And agrees with Dark Sakura
8136000	8138000	According to Famitsu
8138000	8140000	I'm sorry, according to Famitsu's publisher
8140000	8142000	50,000 units were sold on
8142000	8144000	Day 1 in Japan
8144000	8146000	So the game is doing huge in Japan
8146000	8148000	And sold a lot
8148000	8150000	Like it or not, it looks like this game
8150000	8152000	Will probably have similar success
8152000	8154000	Over here, but again, you know
8154000	8156000	To recap what we've kinda said before on this program
8156000	8158000	At least myself
8158000	8160000	If it gets young kids interested in music
8160000	8162000	It's not a bad thing, but for this old kid
8162000	8164000	No thank you, I'll pass
8164000	8166000	So
8166000	8168000	More gaming news
8168000	8170000	Just one more
8170000	8172000	Then we're gonna open up the Skype line pretty soon
8172000	8174000	At 877-GAME-OLR
8174000	8176000	Nice plug
8176000	8178000	Nice plug
8178000	8180000	Well, this goes back to a series
8180000	8182000	That was one of the first ones I ever played
8182000	8184000	When the Playstation first came out
8184000	8186000	In fact, it was one of the
8186000	8188000	First games that anyone played
8188000	8190000	On the Playstation when it first came out
8190000	8192000	It was Toshinden
8192000	8194000	I love Toshinden
8194000	8196000	Actually, the third one was great
8196000	8198000	Because it was awful
8198000	8200000	It had the butt monkey in it and the guy with the chainsaw
8200000	8202000	Named David
8202000	8204000	He did the butt monkey dance!
8204000	8206000	Okay
8206000	8208000	No, he was like a baboon and he had a big red butt
8208000	8210000	And whenever he went
8210000	8212000	He would do this little clappy dance
8212000	8214000	With his butt
8214000	8216000	So anyway
8216000	8218000	There's actually news
8218000	8220000	In Famitsu that says
8220000	8222000	Takara Tomy is going to be bringing
8222000	8224000	Out the Toshinden series on the Wii
8224000	8226000	So maybe they'll actually
8226000	8228000	Make it better?
8228000	8230000	Who knows?
8230000	8232000	You get to spank the monkey's butt
8232000	8234000	But it looks kinda cool
8234000	8236000	I love Toshinden
8236000	8238000	You know, I guess
8238000	8240000	Retro games making a comeback is nothing new
8240000	8242000	In this current gen world
8242000	8244000	I need to go
8244000	8246000	That just means I need to go find that issue of Famitsu
8246000	8248000	Wario Land is pretty good for that
8248000	8250000	Wario Land?
8250000	8252000	Have you bought the new Wario Land?
8252000	8254000	It's very good
8254000	8256000	It's this great 2D animation
8256000	8258000	It's good
8258000	8260000	Anyhow, sorry
8260000	8262000	Let's talk about PC games a little bit quickly
8262000	8264000	No! Boycott!
8264000	8266000	Well, there's no boycott
8266000	8268000	Yet
8268000	8270000	But Far Cry 2 is going to be bundled with
8270000	8272000	Everybody's favorite sport
8272000	8274000	Digital Rights Management
8274000	8276000	You can get Securom
8276000	8278000	Technology
8278000	8280000	Along with Far Cry 2
8280000	8282000	It will be
8282000	8284000	It will have these restrictions
8284000	8286000	The purchasers will have up to
8286000	8288000	Five activations on three
8288000	8290000	Separate PCs
8290000	8292000	Uninstalling Far Cry 2
8292000	8294000	Refunds in activation
8294000	8296000	This process is known as a revoke
8296000	8298000	As long as you properly uninstall the game
8298000	8300000	You'll be able to reinstall it an unlimited
8300000	8302000	Number of times on three machines
8302000	8304000	A computer
8304000	8306000	Can be upgraded an unlimited
8306000	8308000	Number of times using revoke
8308000	8310000	Ubisoft is
8310000	8312000	Willing to provide additional activations
8312000	8314000	If necessary
8314000	8316000	Ubisoft is committed to a long term support
8316000	8318000	Of their games
8318000	8320000	And you'll always be able to play Far Cry 2
8320000	8322000	So apparently
8322000	8324000	This is what they're going to start doing from now on
8324000	8326000	I don't understand why they're still using Securom
8326000	8328000	Technology since it can be so easily broken
8328000	8330000	And people just hate it in general
8330000	8332000	But do people as a whole
8332000	8334000	Do they really seem to care?
8334000	8336000	Well, not according to EA who says that
8336000	8338000	With a small percentage
8338000	8340000	They're claiming that 99.8%
8340000	8342000	Of consumers will never notice
8342000	8344000	The digital rights management
8344000	8346000	That's in the game
8346000	8348000	Which I think is kind of sad that they don't notice
8348000	8350000	That it's in there because it could potentially
8350000	8352000	Harm their system
8352000	8354000	Especially when it comes to
8354000	8356000	CD burning software and stuff like that
8356000	8358000	Whatever that it interrupts
8358000	8360000	And the fact that these people are unaware
8360000	8362000	That this game is actually causing this problem
8362000	8364000	That they will go take it in
8364000	8366000	And cost them money
8366000	8368000	But either way they say we can eliminate piracy
8368000	8370000	By essentially blocking the online service
8370000	8372000	From the pirate
8372000	8374000	It's called the future of
8374000	8376000	Digital rights management
8376000	8378000	Well, that's nice, you know, but some people don't really care about
8378000	8380000	The online portion of your game
8380000	8382000	And they will still pirate it
8382000	8384000	In fact, I think there was quite a few copies
8384000	8386000	Of Spore that were pirated
8386000	8388000	And to be honest, all they're losing
8388000	8390000	Is the online portion of it
8390000	8392000	And if you really don't give a crap about seeing other people's penis monsters
8392000	8394000	Then you can still play the game
8394000	8396000	LegendofZaco in chat says
8396000	8398000	Gotta love EA pulling voodoo stats out of their asses
8398000	8400000	Is that what this is?
8400000	8402000	I think so
8402000	8404000	I mean
8404000	8406000	I don't know, we don't know for sure how many people actually know about it
8406000	8408000	So we have to take their word for it
8408000	8410000	It's not necessarily that they're pulling it out of their ass
8410000	8412000	It's just the way they report the numbers
8412000	8414000	That's just politics
8414000	8416000	Anyhow
8416000	8418000	It's like they think that people that are complaining about it are gonna go
8418000	8420000	Oh, well, okay
8420000	8422000	So not that many people are complaining about it
8422000	8424000	I guess I'll just stop complaining
8424000	8426000	You're right
8426000	8428000	No, that's not gonna happen
8428000	8430000	Anyhow, one more story
8430000	8432000	Then we're gonna get to some calls on the skype line
8432000	8434000	And this one has to do with Ghostbusters
8434000	8436000	You know that game that we hear things about it
8436000	8438000	Then it goes away, then it comes back
8438000	8440000	Well, people are talking about Ghostbusters again
8440000	8442000	And it's all thanks to Dan Aykroyd
8442000	8444000	Which of course is one of the actors in the original movie
8444000	8446000	And he was on a Dallas radio station this week
8446000	8448000	105.3
8448000	8450000	And he talked to the radio station
8450000	8452000	And actually confirmed that the Ghostbusters title
8452000	8454000	Has been picked up by Atari to be published
8454000	8456000	And said that the game
8456000	8458000	Will be less than a year away from being released
8458000	8460000	So apparently
8460000	8462000	It is confirmed that Atari
8462000	8464000	Has picked up the game
8464000	8466000	And Atari will be publishing the game
8466000	8468000	Don't expect to see it tomorrow, though
8468000	8470000	They're saying the polish and cleaning up the game
8470000	8472000	Could take as long as May of 2009
8472000	8474000	So you'll see this game
8474000	8476000	At some point next year
8476000	8478000	That could also mean Christmas 2009
8478000	8480000	That's crazier than a
8480000	8482000	Vaporous full torso apparition
8482000	8484000	Thanks
8484000	8486000	That makes me giddy
8486000	8488000	But we're talking about piss in the chat room
8488000	8490000	Um, okay
8490000	8492000	Exactly
8492000	8494000	Chat.orangelandsradio.com for an experience
8494000	8496000	That really can't be described
8496000	8498000	Oh my
8498000	8500000	It's talking about scientific fact
8500000	8502000	That urine is a sterile solution
8502000	8504000	Do you ever talk games in the
8504000	8506000	Area of medical curiosity?
8506000	8508000	Do you pee on your video games?
8508000	8510000	Someone brought up peeing in the shower
8510000	8512000	And I was
8512000	8514000	I was making fun and doing the girly thing
8514000	8516000	Who wants to stand in their own piss?
8516000	8518000	1877 game O.L.R.
8518000	8520000	Now is a great time
8520000	8522000	Now is an excellent time
8522000	8524000	I hope Sigourney Weaver is in the game
8524000	8526000	Yes, the acidic vampire
8526000	8528000	Is a very good point
8528000	8530000	And of course Dark Tetsuya brings up
8530000	8532000	O.L.R. is like pissing in an ocean of piss
8532000	8534000	Will the game be nearly as cool
8534000	8536000	As the Commodore 64 version
8536000	8538000	Of Ghostbusters? That's what I want to know
8540000	8542000	Dude, you are red
8542000	8544000	I love that the first
8544000	8546000	Half of the show was really smart
8546000	8548000	And intelligent and the second half has been nothing
8548000	8550000	But piss and fart
8550000	8552000	God
8552000	8554000	This show is just so strange
8554000	8556000	Maybe our caller
8556000	8558000	Let's go to the phones
8558000	8560000	We have a caller, let's see if they're gonna
8560000	8562000	What IQ level they're at tonight
8562000	8564000	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio, who's this?
8564000	8566000	This is Ranma, who is just as immature
8566000	8568000	As everybody else in the studio
8568000	8570000	Oh, hooray
8570000	8572000	Ranma, what's on your mind?
8572000	8574000	Not much, Rob
8574000	8576000	I have a bone to pick with you
8576000	8578000	Oh god, what did I do now?
8578000	8580000	I'm offended by how you pronounce people's names
8582000	8584000	Yeah, you know, I find it pretty offensive too
8584000	8586000	That I can't learn to fucking read
8586000	8588000	Especially with all the languages
8588000	8590000	In the world that people derive their names from
8590000	8592000	I'm very offended that I just don't, like, fucking know
8592000	8594000	Because, you know, sometimes
8594000	8596000	You read things one way in one language
8596000	8598000	And they read another way in another
8598000	8600000	And I'm offended by my lack of edumacation
8602000	8604000	You know we love you, Rob, right?
8604000	8606000	Yeah, I know
8606000	8608000	Are you just trying to be a smartass about something?
8608000	8610000	Yes
8610000	8612000	And what?
8612000	8614000	But the whole little big plan is just
8614000	8616000	It's ridiculous, that's all it is
8616000	8618000	And why do you say ridiculous?
8620000	8622000	Everybody gets offended over something
8622000	8624000	And the problem is, not enough people in this world
8624000	8626000	Is open-minded to realize it's nothing to be
8626000	8628000	It's nothing that serious
8628000	8630000	That's all it is
8630000	8632000	I'm just saying, in a way, how Muslims are kind of being
8632000	8634000	Like, subjugated
8634000	8636000	About what's going on in the news and the media
8636000	8638000	So, of course, something like this they're gonna pick up on
8638000	8640000	And they're gonna lose their minds about it
8640000	8642000	Is that really Sony's fault, though?
8642000	8644000	Because, you know, kind of like I was saying before
8644000	8646000	If Sony doesn't do anything about this
8646000	8648000	And then the mainstream media picks up on this
8648000	8650000	I mean, it's gonna do a lot of damage
8650000	8652000	Whereas Sony's trying to put out a fire here
8652000	8654000	Before it gets too big
8654000	8656000	But why should they?
8656000	8658000	I mean, it's a normal song, big deal
8658000	8660000	Sadly, it's the world we live in
8660000	8662000	And I'm not saying it's alright
8662000	8664000	It's just, you know, it's what it is
8664000	8666000	Yeah
8666000	8668000	What else is on your mind?
8668000	8670000	Have you been to any cons lately you wanna talk about?
8670000	8672000	Yes, I just got back from a convention
8672000	8674000	About six, seven hours ago
8674000	8676000	You are the con king
8676000	8678000	What con did you go to this time?
8678000	8680000	I'm a con whore
8680000	8682000	I went to Zenkai Con
8682000	8684000	Where is Zenkai Con?
8684000	8686000	Valley Forge Convention Center
8686000	8688000	Valley Forge, Pennsylvania
8688000	8690000	It's where Classic Gaming Expo was a few years ago
8690000	8692000	Ah, okay, so how was it?
8692000	8694000	Was there a lot of gaming stuff to be seen there?
8694000	8696000	Or was it mostly anime, or what?
8696000	8698000	It was a mix of A and B
8698000	8700000	But it wasn't that many video gaming cosplay
8700000	8702000	But I will say the game room was nice
8702000	8704000	It was...
8704000	8706000	It was great
8706000	8708000	Did you get to play anything in the game room you hadn't played before?
8708000	8711000	I pretty much, I played the new Bleach game for the Wii
8711000	8713000	That one I had not played yet
8713000	8715000	What'd you think?
8715000	8717000	I thought it was pretty good
8717000	8719000	I liked the fact that to attack
8719000	8721000	You actually shake the Wii mode to attack
8721000	8723000	You attack in the game
8723000	8725000	Which is something I've never seen in a Wii game before, really
8725000	8727000	Yeah
8727000	8729000	Never heard of that one
8729000	8731000	Well that's cool
8731000	8733000	What do you think about anime games
8733000	8735000	On gaming consoles in general
8735000	8737000	Because a lot of us kind of write them off as crap
8737000	8740000	Just like a lot of movie and TV show game translations
8740000	8743000	Are there anime games out there that seem to transcend this
8743000	8745000	Or are they just crap too?
8745000	8747000	It depends
8747000	8749000	I mean, when I got into Ranma 1.5
8749000	8751000	And then the video game came out
8751000	8753000	I thought the game was good
8753000	8755000	But looking back, I kind of hard battled
8755000	8757000	The only one that came to the states
8757000	8759000	That was a good one
8759000	8761000	It didn't really follow the story line though
8761000	8763000	It was good
8763000	8765000	Nowadays with a lot of anime games
8765000	8767000	They're actually taking the story lines
8767000	8769000	And putting it into the game
8769000	8771000	If you notice how all the Dragon Ball Z games are
8771000	8773000	Even though they're rehashes
8773000	8775000	But they're actually taking the story line
8775000	8777000	And following along with this
8777000	8779000	Why there's like five different sequels to a game
8783000	8785000	What system was this?
8785000	8787000	I've never played the Ranma
8787000	8789000	I played a Ranma game on Super Nintendo
8789000	8791000	That's the one
8791000	8793000	There's also one on PC Engine
8793000	8795000	There's an RPG on PC Engine
8795000	8797000	Which I've played a little bit of
8797000	8799000	It's kind of hard
8799000	8801000	On Playstation there was a Ranma 1.5 Battle Renaissance
8801000	8803000	Which I've got and it's kind of fun
8803000	8805000	Rice Princess is like Ranma
8805000	8807000	Because if you pour water on her she goes
8807000	8809000	Shut up
8809000	8811000	Did you play Battle Renaissance?
8811000	8813000	Yeah, I played it
8813000	8815000	The engine was a little bit loose
8815000	8817000	But it was still fun
8817000	8819000	I love actually kicking people's butts
8819000	8821000	There you go
8821000	8823000	Yeah
8823000	8825000	Alright, well any other comments before we get some more calls?
8825000	8827000	One thing
8827000	8829000	You'll probably get a real kick out of
8829000	8831000	I'll have pictures uploaded soon
8831000	8833000	We had a samba de amigo dance party
8833000	8835000	At the convention Friday night
8835000	8837000	Oh dear good lord
8837000	8839000	How exactly does one go to a samba de amigo dance party?
8839000	8841000	You get
8841000	8843000	You show up
8843000	8845000	You grab the maracas
8845000	8847000	You start playing
8847000	8849000	You start freestyling and dancing
8849000	8851000	First few minutes no one really showed up
8851000	8853000	But as the music started blasting
8853000	8855000	We had a line going all the way down
8855000	8857000	People just wanted to get up and have fun with it
8857000	8859000	We were giving out little maracas
8859000	8861000	As prizes
8861000	8863000	We had sombrero hats giving them out to
8863000	8865000	Where we could do the best funky dance ever
8865000	8867000	You should put that on YouTube
8867000	8869000	Promptly
8869000	8871000	If it's not up now it should be up by later this week
8871000	8873000	And I will find images and links
8873000	8875000	And I'll send it to you guys
8875000	8877000	Alright Rama we gotta let you go
8877000	8879000	But have a good one buddy
8879000	8881000	You too enjoy
8881000	8883000	Our username on skype is OrangeLoungeRadio
8883000	8885000	If you want to give us a call
8885000	8887000	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this?
8887000	8889000	Hello OrangeLoungeRadio
8889000	8891000	Is he who seeks to replace
8891000	8893000	The train wreck of the general masses
8893000	8895000	With the train wreck of his own choosing
8895000	8897000	Hello
8897000	8899000	R
8899000	8901000	Introduce yourself
8901000	8903000	Bob Adrian of Hydra
8903000	8905000	I know who you are
8905000	8907000	But you have to introduce yourself to the listeners
8907000	8909000	I'm Jason
8909000	8911000	Alright what's on your mind
8911000	8913000	Since we ever so briefly touched on it
8913000	8915000	I thought I'd add in a couple little comments
8915000	8917000	Since we didn't really go onto it
8917000	8919000	Two side notes before I do that
8919000	8921000	Jump Superstars while it wasn't really
8921000	8923000	An anime game to the same extent
8923000	8925000	You were talking about
8925000	8927000	A good game, it was a very good fighter
8927000	8929000	Not one that I've really
8929000	8931000	I'm not much of a fighter person but I had a lot of fun with Jump Superstars
8931000	8933000	I played that a little bit and it is fun
8933000	8935000	And the other side note
8935000	8937000	Has anybody even played
8937000	8939000	The DR Universe series?
8939000	8941000	Yeah I have the first game
8941000	8943000	I don't have the second game
8943000	8945000	I have the first game and although quest mode
8945000	8947000	Was awful awful awful I like the song list
8947000	8949000	And steps of what there was
8949000	8951000	When I bought my
8951000	8953000	Xbox I have quite a few
8953000	8955000	Other games as well but my initial reasoning
8955000	8957000	For wanting to buy it was pretty much purely
8957000	8959000	The UltraMix series
8959000	8961000	And they were great
8961000	8963000	And then E3 came around with the
8963000	8965000	Universe redone banners from
8965000	8967000	Boring hell
8967000	8969000	And I've just never cared to play the
8969000	8971000	Universe series at all
8971000	8973000	Yeah but past the banners it's kind of nice to have the game
8973000	8975000	In high def and wide screen
8975000	8977000	It's a neat little change for the game
8977000	8979000	It probably is I don't doubt that
8979000	8981000	But I mean UltraMix was never
8981000	8983000	The most visually appealing game in the first place
8983000	8985000	I don't think anybody is going to deny that
8985000	8987000	It played really well past the first one
8987000	8989000	But it never looked that way
8989000	8991000	Universe 2 was kind of just like Universe 1 from what I
8991000	8993000	Understood but Universe 3 is supposed
8993000	8995000	To be a lot different so I'm
8995000	8997000	I'm curious I'll check it out probably
8997000	8999000	Funny all this from
8999000	9001000	The Bimani series
9001000	9003000	The Bimani show that was and
9003000	9005000	Is only a footnote now
9005000	9007000	Yeah well you know and a lot of shows
9007000	9009000	Still don't even talk about it at all and a lot of shows
9009000	9011000	Would just say oh it's another
9011000	9013000	DDR game they're all the same and to some
9013000	9015000	Extent they're right but there are
9015000	9017000	There are definitely those differences out there
9017000	9019000	Well now it's time to talk about it
9019000	9021000	And in the process talk about me
9021000	9023000	Kind of, not really
9023000	9025000	Funny story, have you guys heard of the
9025000	9027000	There's a sim file that DMSura
9027000	9029000	Made quite a while ago called DeltaMax
9029000	9031000	Ever heard of it?
9031000	9033000	Yes, vaguely, I know what DMSura
9033000	9035000	Is but I vaguely know
9035000	9037000	The gimmick so to say about it
9037000	9039000	Isn't it that you hit all four notes
9039000	9041000	At once or something?
9041000	9043000	That's an old gimmick but that's okay
9043000	9045000	I don't
9045000	9047000	The gimmick is that it's a
9047000	9049000	DMSura remix of the Max series
9049000	9051000	And it starts at I think
9051000	9053000	130 beats per minute
9053000	9055000	And ends at 573
9055000	9057000	Is that the one, oh okay
9057000	9059000	Is it the one that rolls backwards because I remember that being
9059000	9061000	A gimmick too, alright
9061000	9063000	Okay so it starts
9063000	9065000	It's all progression, 130 to 573
9065000	9067000	It's kind of like a
9067000	9069000	BPM per measure
9069000	9071000	But it speeds up
9071000	9073000	The speed is not statically
9073000	9075000	Increasing, it is very variable, it goes with the
9075000	9077000	Tune, it's actually really cool
9077000	9079000	There's a step mania cabinet
9079000	9081000	That a friend of ours built into
9081000	9083000	The DDR machine down in Colorado Springs
9083000	9085000	That there's a tournament going on
9085000	9087000	At next month, not that anybody
9087000	9089000	Hey if you're in the Colorado area come down to Mr. Big's
9089000	9091000	Next weekend rather, not next month
9091000	9093000	There's going to be a lot of cool people there
9093000	9095000	Ding, that's my plug for the day
9095000	9097000	So he has a step mania
9097000	9099000	Cab with all of the official DDR songs
9099000	9101000	A ton of sim files, delta max
9101000	9103000	Being one of them and a couple of other little
9103000	9105000	Bonus extras like in the groove
9105000	9107000	I was very very
9107000	9109000	Disappointed to hear that
9109000	9111000	Delta max in universe
9111000	9113000	3 isn't going to have
9113000	9115000	The sim created background
9115000	9117000	Video, because if it
9117000	9119000	Did I could have claimed a
9119000	9121000	My own little piece of assistance
9121000	9123000	Property in a DDR official game
9123000	9125000	Why did you do
9125000	9127000	Something with this?
9127000	9129000	There's a person nicknamed
9129000	9131000	Tora that I
9131000	9133000	Believe he actually did all of the background work
9133000	9135000	Basically, I don't even remember what the
9135000	9137000	Image background is, but he
9137000	9139000	Created a series of text of all of the beats per minute
9139000	9141000	All the BPM numbers
9141000	9143000	And they have this
9143000	9145000	Shaky fluid effect
9145000	9147000	And he put the
9147000	9149000	Videos for that together amazingly
9149000	9151000	But what I did was I wrote out a quick
9151000	9153000	Little script to actually put
9153000	9155000	In the changes that he wanted to
9155000	9157000	And again it goes up
9157000	9159000	It was a pain in the ass
9159000	9161000	Too
9161000	9163000	Just the changes in the videos
9163000	9165000	The fact that it's not just linear straight up
9165000	9167000	Calculating which measurement and time that it happens on
9167000	9169000	I barely even remember
9169000	9171000	That was like 3 years ago
9171000	9173000	But it was a very awesome video
9173000	9175000	It was very simple
9175000	9177000	But Konami came in and changed it all?
9177000	9179000	They want to do their own thing probably
9179000	9181000	It'll be flowers and sparkles
9181000	9183000	No it's
9183000	9185000	Universe, it'll be spaceships
9185000	9187000	And Uranus
9187000	9189000	On that note
9189000	9191000	It'll be a lot of
9191000	9193000	Delta triangles flying over the screen
9193000	9195000	Because you know, Delta and
9195000	9197000	Triangles
9197000	9199000	Oh my god, trigonometry, no!
9199000	9201000	Well sorry to hear you just missed your chance
9201000	9203000	For remote video game stardom
9203000	9205000	Hey you have OLR stardom
9205000	9207000	Any other things you want to say
9207000	9209000	Real quick before we move on?
9209000	9211000	No I think that was my excuse
9211000	9213000	For calling in tonight
9213000	9215000	Well Jason take care, thanks for your comments
9215000	9217000	Alright guys
9217000	9219000	We'll take one more call
9219000	9221000	1877 game OLR, username on skype
9221000	9223000	Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call
9223000	9225000	And then we have some last minute stories to do
9225000	9227000	Before we get on out of here, hey live listeners
9227000	9229000	You'll want to stay tuned tonight
9229000	9231000	Past the show, we have a little treat for you guys
9231000	9233000	We'll get into that in a little while
9233000	9235000	Be sure to join us next week for episode 300
9263000	9265000	Do you think though that they might have
9265000	9267000	Lasted a lot of sales chance because a lot of the
9267000	9269000	People that would have been interested in this are just going to go to
9269000	9271000	The fan translation? I guess let me rephrase
9271000	9273000	How many of the people that end up playing the fan
9273000	9275000	Translation do you think would turn around and buy something official
9275000	9277000	From Nintendo?
9277000	9279000	That's a good question
9279000	9281000	I myself would buy the official thing
9281000	9283000	If it were to come out
9283000	9285000	In fact the translators encourage
9285000	9287000	Buying the official
9287000	9289000	Merchandise and stuff
9289000	9291000	But as far as the
9291000	9293000	Nintendo side of things I just hope that
9293000	9295000	If they
9295000	9297000	Decide to do something like sue the translators
9297000	9299000	Or something like that
9299000	9301000	It means that
9301000	9303000	That they're working on an official translation
9303000	9305000	That they're not just going to leave it
9305000	9307000	Dead. You know I think a lot of people
9307000	9309000	Are like you and you know if they're real true
9309000	9311000	Fans of the series they would buy an official
9311000	9313000	Translation anyway but do you think there's some people
9313000	9315000	That would feel so slighted that once they play
9315000	9317000	Through the translation they're just going to be like
9317000	9319000	Yeah screw the real one
9319000	9321000	Yeah that's a good
9321000	9323000	That's a good point
9323000	9325000	Kind of like when I
9325000	9327000	Like I used to download
9327000	9329000	A lot of like money songs
9329000	9331000	They're like buying it and stuff
9331000	9333000	Nah screw buying the real thing
9333000	9335000	I'll just keep it
9335000	9337000	Especially with the import stuff
9337000	9339000	Well I guess we will see
9339000	9341000	I'm very curious to see if it does
9341000	9343000	Catch the attention of people in Nintendo
9343000	9345000	I'm waiting for the cease and desist myself
9345000	9347000	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight
9347000	9349000	Yeah
9349000	9351000	Sky you're in Milpitas Golf Land
9351000	9353000	Damn we need to come down to Sunnyville Golf Land again
9353000	9355000	Um you know I know I knew
9355000	9357000	I was in the area just it worked out
9357000	9359000	So that we were at Milpitas and I didn't make it over there
9359000	9361000	But I'll get to Sunnyville at some point
9361000	9363000	I'm sure
9363000	9365000	Yeah maybe the NorCal division of the
9365000	9367000	All-Armor can meet up there
9367000	9369000	We'll see we'll see you know um
9369000	9371000	With the surgery coming up and everything it won't be anytime soon
9371000	9373000	But who knows maybe by the end of the year
9373000	9375000	Yeah I was saying
9375000	9377000	We're going to Svega Lailies
9377000	9379000	For Popin' 16
9379000	9381000	Oh hey I like popin' music
9381000	9383000	It's certainly better than beatin' groovy
9383000	9385000	Yeah I've gotten back into it recently
9385000	9387000	Yeah
9387000	9389000	I might get a job
9389000	9391000	Like I'm possibly getting a job
9391000	9393000	Where in the winter I might use the money to get a desktop arcade
9393000	9395000	So I can play the real thing at home
9395000	9397000	Instead of frickin' 9 key 2DX
9399000	9401000	Good times good times
9401000	9403000	I wish I
9403000	9405000	I wish I had that kind of disposable income
9405000	9407000	But then again I'm looking at my new iPhone
9407000	9409000	When I'm saying that
9409000	9411000	We all have priorities
9411000	9413000	Alright GS6 here we gotta let you go
9413000	9415000	But have a good one buddy
9415000	9417000	Alright bye bye
9417000	9419000	You know Dekeman in chat has a good point
9419000	9421000	He says they've had two years to give them a cease and desist
9421000	9423000	Sometimes it's not until you start getting noticed
9423000	9425000	Like hello in the groove
9425000	9427000	Remember that?
9427000	9429000	Nobody cared until they tried to put out a home version of the game
9429000	9431000	Alright anyway
9431000	9433000	Last minute stories
9433000	9435000	DarkSoccer anything for us tonight for last minute stories?
9435000	9437000	Yeah
9437000	9439000	What?
9439000	9441000	Fire
9441000	9443000	Loki you always have something for last minute stories
9443000	9445000	Yeah a few more things real quick
9445000	9447000	We know that Guitar Hero they're talking about
9447000	9449000	Making god knows how many games next year
9449000	9451000	Well there's yet another one that's been
9451000	9453000	Discovered
9453000	9455000	A trademark has recently been placed
9455000	9457000	For the title
9457000	9459000	Guitar Hero Modern Hits
9459000	9463000	And no word on exactly what that is
9463000	9465000	Of course the term hit is relative
9465000	9467000	Exactly
9467000	9469000	Who knows
9469000	9471000	If I were to take a guess I think it's another DS version
9471000	9473000	It sounds like a DS version to me
9473000	9475000	That's a good point
9475000	9477000	It's pretty vague
9477000	9479000	Alright
9479000	9481000	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas will be coming to
9481000	9483000	Xbox Live Marketplace
9483000	9485000	As an Xbox original
9485000	9487000	Starting well actually
9487000	9489000	This Monday October 20th
9489000	9491000	So you'll be able to download the full game
9491000	9493000	For $15 or
9493000	9495000	1200 Microsoft Points
9495000	9497000	So that's pretty cool
9497000	9499000	Also
9499000	9501000	Fable 2
9501000	9503000	You should definitely go to
9503000	9505000	Microsoft's website
9505000	9507000	They have a special website made for Fable 2
9507000	9509000	Xbox.com
9509000	9511000	I believe you just go to the Fable 2 page
9511000	9513000	They have a little game that you can play
9513000	9515000	Including Chicken Kickin
9515000	9517000	You can actually win prizes
9517000	9519000	For your in-game character
9519000	9521000	So you can win gold and different prizes
9521000	9523000	In Fable 2
9523000	9525000	Playing this Flash game
9525000	9527000	Which I think is pretty cool and hasn't been done before
9527000	9529000	So hopefully you see some more
9529000	9531000	Website integration with different games
9531000	9533000	If it's not another week
9533000	9535000	With another movie announcement
9535000	9537000	Based on a game
9537000	9539000	Well Grant Morrison is now
9539000	9541000	Doing the Area 51 game
9541000	9543000	You know what though? Max Payne was number one
9543000	9545000	At the box office this week beating that very
9545000	9547000	Hyped W movie
9547000	9549000	So there's money to be made
9549000	9551000	Yeah
9551000	9553000	So interesting
9553000	9555000	Area 51 the movie
9555000	9557000	Hopefully it's cheesy and motion captured
9557000	9559000	Then there's
9559000	9561000	Going to be some new download content for Mega Man
9561000	9563000	9 coming soon including a brand new
9563000	9565000	Bonus level with a bonus boss
9565000	9567000	Fake Man
9567000	9569000	And you'll be able to purchase
9569000	9571000	That for 100 Wii
9571000	9573000	Points
9573000	9575000	Will it not be impossibly hard?
9575000	9577000	Probably not
9577000	9579000	But it's a brand new special stage
9579000	9581000	Oh my god I can't play that game
9581000	9583000	And lastly to kind of talk a little bit about
9583000	9585000	Another game that
9585000	9587000	We'll be seeing a little bit more pretty soon
9587000	9589000	Little Big Planet
9589000	9591000	They actually have some more videos from the beta
9591000	9593000	Someone has actually recreated some of the levels
9593000	9595000	From Mirror's Edge
9595000	9597000	In this game
9597000	9599000	So you can actually play some of the Mirror's Edge
9599000	9601000	In the beta and of course the full game
9601000	9603000	When it comes out because all those levels are
9603000	9605000	Being transferred over which is pretty
9605000	9607000	Freaking awesome
9607000	9609000	And that's it
9609000	9611000	Well that's going to do it for tonight's episode of
9611000	9613000	Orange Lounge Radio but before we
9613000	9615000	Finish the show tonight we got to go around and get everybody's
9615000	9617000	Final thought
9617000	9619000	Fart Princess thank you for coming to the show
9619000	9621000	When you did and everything
9621000	9623000	Do you have a final thought for us?
9623000	9625000	Even though you were late
9625000	9627000	Vote no on Poop 8
9627000	9629000	The Doctor
9629000	9631000	Do you have any final thoughts?
9633000	9635000	Don't vote for McCain
9635000	9637000	He's crazy
9637000	9639000	We're getting a little political tonight
9639000	9641000	Loki do you have
9641000	9643000	A final thought?
9643000	9645000	My costume
9645000	9647000	Is freaking awesome
9647000	9649000	And you may see it next week
9649000	9651000	Is it Tingle?
9651000	9653000	It's a video game character
9653000	9655000	Okay
9655000	9657000	My final thought is
9657000	9659000	Mentos
9659000	9661000	Fresh and full of life
9661000	9663000	Darsakha your final thought?
