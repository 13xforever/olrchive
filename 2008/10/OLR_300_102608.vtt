the sniffles um all right well hey you know what otherwise as far as what we have planned tonight

05:57.200 --> 06:01.840
it's just another show nothing special lots of gaming news to talk about tonight but we have to

06:01.840 --> 06:06.160
start it off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week dark soccer how was

06:06.160 --> 06:13.360
your gaming week um it was a big fable i didn't do much playing in it however dan did and he's

06:13.360 --> 06:18.080
been throwing fire at people and showing off his trophy which i think is entirely and flipping

06:18.080 --> 06:25.120
everyone off which is just the best ever and his guy looks kind of like a gorilla um with a red

06:25.120 --> 06:30.160
coat and it's kind of cool and i've decided that when i play fable um play fable 2 i'm going to

06:30.160 --> 06:37.600
make the biggest raging lesbian ever you're still a chicken chaser you chase chickens i'm okay and

06:38.480 --> 06:42.720
but he had to do the thing where he had to wear dreads and mutton chops and the dress and they

06:42.720 --> 06:47.760
said it was the wrong dress and that was kind of funny and i've been playing ragnarok of course

06:48.720 --> 06:55.440
and um i got my ds finally however it's not here it's at home but dan got me a black ds

06:56.640 --> 07:02.640
much very similar to melton's black ds you have a blue one that melton has like a little star

07:02.640 --> 07:08.320
wars thing on it's pretty neat little uh i could i could totally bust out my uh miyamoto stickers

07:08.320 --> 07:16.800
though from e3 a few years ago but um but yes i have a nice one i babysat yesterday too really

07:16.800 --> 07:22.560
yes did you play any games with the baby we went to the jungle gym and played let's splash

07:22.560 --> 07:28.320
all of the water in the fountain and um baby's gonna slide down whether you're at the bottom

07:28.320 --> 07:38.160
to catch him or not and let's see how many times catch the baby and it was also let's let's see

07:38.160 --> 07:43.600
how often julian will run back to the swings and beg to be in it only to not do anything but look

07:43.600 --> 07:48.240
at the other children i think the orange lounge radio official game should be something a lot like

07:48.240 --> 07:52.320
wario wear where all the little micro games are like little in-jokes from the show and there

07:52.320 --> 07:57.760
should be one where dark sakura is there with a big net and it says catch and baby stars and

07:57.760 --> 08:04.720
there's babies falling from the sky i do have to say i do have to say and this he's such a

08:04.720 --> 08:10.000
good kid that he's the reason why i'm no longer afraid of most babies in small numbers namely one

08:10.000 --> 08:17.680
do you want to eat them like shane no shane has um subscriptions we we heart you shane you've

08:17.680 --> 08:21.520
got subscriptions he's not listening he hates this show all right well he hates everything

08:21.520 --> 08:29.600
that he likes anything else high school musical oh lord my god all right uh you're cut off all

08:29.600 --> 08:35.200
right no no loki sack boy sack loki how was your gaming week um i didn't play that much this week

08:35.200 --> 08:44.080
mainly i played um little big planet i love that game um it's actually i'm now in the japanese

08:44.080 --> 08:48.640
level which is pretty cool so i'm dressed up like a ninja and i've got uh i'm a ninja pirate because

08:48.640 --> 08:55.440
i'm wearing the ninja the ninja uh and i've got the uh pirate outfit and um i'm carrying a frying

08:55.440 --> 09:01.360
pan so that's awesome and how is everyone's a little bit racist the game um pretty good but it

09:01.360 --> 09:08.480
apparently uh it's not going to be as racist soon so um no i mean come on it was we were looking at

09:08.480 --> 09:12.320
it on justin tv last week after the show it's like a little present for our live listeners and we

09:12.320 --> 09:18.320
saw like a bunch of like you know that the africa level is all the africa stereotypes and you know

09:18.320 --> 09:23.360
the south america level is all those stereotypes you know and the america level was hot dogs and

09:23.360 --> 09:29.120
cheeseburgers just i know actually it was it was race cars and jazz there you go wait wait wait

09:29.120 --> 09:36.080
if you go to maticas car will they shut down everything i don't know um now i'm glad though

09:36.080 --> 09:41.520
when they did fix the song um that they didn't actually remove it from the game they just edited

09:41.520 --> 09:45.840
out the lyrics which is awesome because the song itself was awesome and to be honest if the lyrics

09:45.840 --> 09:50.800
aren't in there i'm not sad so all right whatever but um other than that i've been playing saints

09:50.800 --> 09:56.240
row 2 multiplayer because that's fun still glitchy in fact we found a new trick now apparently if you

09:56.240 --> 10:00.080
throw satchel charges on people because you can actually stick them to other players if i like

10:00.080 --> 10:04.480
for example stick multiple satchel charges on when they respawn they still have the ones that haven't

10:04.480 --> 10:09.680
exploded yet so you can detonate them again and kill them again which is uh kind of a boo-boo

10:09.680 --> 10:15.760
there but um and then oddly enough i've been watching someone play fable can you guess who

10:15.760 --> 10:23.120
is playing fable 2 my wife is playing fable 2 wait your wife the game hater is playing fable 2

10:23.120 --> 10:27.280
yes she's playing fable 2 she here's how it happened she saw the commercial fort that they

10:27.280 --> 10:32.320
have now where the guy is playing with the little uh i forget what you call those things um and

10:32.320 --> 10:37.440
balls no not balls the little thing the fortune things that you open in your hand it looked like

10:37.440 --> 10:42.160
a little pac-man i don't remember they call those kids in elementary school play with them anyways

10:42.160 --> 10:47.200
so and each time he changes it it's a fortune kudi catcher thank you kudie catcher okay

10:47.200 --> 10:50.880
so he's playing with that and each time he changes it it changes his appearance and

10:50.880 --> 10:54.160
kind of looks evil and stuff like that and ellie's like what game is that that looks

10:54.160 --> 10:58.640
cool because she's really into the whole people becoming evil thing you know like darth vader

10:58.640 --> 11:02.880
she loved the whole like story of darth vader aren't you a little worried that your wife likes

11:02.880 --> 11:08.080
it when people become evil i don't know but anyways so she's like what game is that i'm

11:08.080 --> 11:11.520
I'm like, oh, Fable 2. I'm like, I've had that for a while now. Do you want to play it? She's like,

11:12.800 --> 11:17.040
she's all, yeah, set it up for me. So I set it up for her, kind of helped her walk through it. Now

11:17.040 --> 11:20.400
she's way further in the game than I am. But granted, I've only played the game for like less

11:20.400 --> 11:25.520
than an hour, so, you know. But she, she was like literally when I was leaving today to go finish my

11:25.520 --> 11:30.560
costume before I came over here. She was just like, she's okay, I gotta quit in like half an

11:30.560 --> 11:34.640
hour because I have to go to the gym. And she's just seriously contemplating not going to the

11:34.640 --> 11:41.600
gym to play the game. Nice. Yeah. Wow. Just getting to that point. Yeah. I know it brings

11:41.600 --> 11:47.520
back memories of Final Fantasy XI. I know, a proud gamer moment. Are you a proud gaming husband now?

11:48.880 --> 11:52.160
I, I don't think she's gonna, she's gonna get bored with it because she's not paying attention

11:52.160 --> 11:55.840
to any of the storyline or any of like what's supposed to go on. She's like, kill, kill, die,

11:55.840 --> 11:59.520
die, die, kill, kill, die, die, die. It keeps giving her like helpful hints like, you know,

11:59.520 --> 12:02.800
her life is low, you should go find an inn or some potion. She's like, I don't know where the

12:02.800 --> 12:07.200
hell the inn is. I'm like, go to one of the towns. She's like, I went to the towns, there's no inns

12:07.200 --> 12:12.160
there. I'm like, you need to look around to see if you can find it. Well, I don't know how to do

12:12.160 --> 12:16.240
that. Or like she still doesn't have, she hasn't quite figured out the right analog stick so she

12:16.240 --> 12:20.080
can't change the camera angle very well. Look for the building that says inn on it. I know,

12:20.080 --> 12:23.600
but she doesn't have patience for that stuff. I'm like, well, she's like, what am I supposed

12:23.600 --> 12:26.240
to be doing now? I'm like, well, what'd that guy say to you? I don't know, I wasn't listening to

12:26.240 --> 12:31.520
him. Stuff like that. Let's read some comments from chat. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com. By the way,

12:31.520 --> 12:35.200
I know we have a lot of people on Justin TV tonight because of a Loki being sack boy. I

12:35.200 --> 12:40.320
don't know what it is. If Justin TV highlighted us or something, but please keep in mind, we only

12:40.320 --> 12:44.320
read our regular chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com. That's not because we hate you

12:44.320 --> 12:48.800
guys, Justin TV, but it's because, well, it's partially that, but no, we have a real hard time

12:48.800 --> 12:53.040
reading two chat rooms at once. Cause we are trying to do a show here. So chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

12:53.040 --> 12:58.480
Redertainment in chat says the last time I skipped the gym to game was five years ago. I haven't been

12:58.480 --> 13:05.920
back to the gym since. There you go. All right. Anyhow, I'm assuming that's it for Loki's gaming

13:05.920 --> 13:12.400
week. So I'll talk about my gaming week. Um, I finally bought a PlayStation three after all.

13:12.400 --> 13:18.800
Why are you booing? At least there's good games on it. At least you didn't buy it just because,

13:18.800 --> 13:25.120
Oh, I want a PlayStation 3. Now there were finally games I wanted out. I want little big planet,

13:25.120 --> 13:29.040
even though I wasn't able to get it yesterday, contrary to popular rumor, but I have it all set

13:29.040 --> 13:33.120
up. I have a Blu-ray disc. At least I have Edward Scissorhands on Blu-ray cause that movie is

13:33.120 --> 13:36.560
awesome. You have to get an Amber before Christmas too. It looks good on Blu-ray. And I like to

13:36.560 --> 13:41.040
mention though that last week I was concerned that I may have to return my copy a little bit.

13:41.040 --> 13:45.600
It's my turn. Sorry. So I didn't have to thank God. So I get to keep the slightly offensive

13:45.600 --> 13:49.920
version. Awesome. All right. So yeah, I finally got, took the plunge and got a PlayStation three

13:49.920 --> 13:55.280
for SingStar ABBA as well, even though that's not out till December, but I did buy SingStar

13:55.280 --> 14:00.000
PlayStation three and a, you know, the game itself is kind of crappy compared to like Rob

14:00.000 --> 14:03.840
Band and other songs that you can sing it. But I will tell you the best thing about SingStar

14:03.840 --> 14:07.360
PlayStation three. Actually, there's a couple of good things about it. It's, it's a really good

14:07.360 --> 14:12.000
party game because it has the music videos in the back. It's a, it's a good game for non-gamers.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.880
If that makes sense. Like it's a good game for people to just pick up the mics and sing and have

14:14.880 --> 14:18.800
fun with it. And there are a lot of songs on the SingStar, even though I haven't heard of half of

14:18.800 --> 14:23.120
them. There's like 300 songs on that store, but I'll tell you the best part is that part. That's

14:23.120 --> 14:27.520
like YouTube that you can go in there and look at the community videos. Um, I don't have a webcam

14:27.520 --> 14:31.280
myself. Thank you very much. I don't want to put myself on there now. Don't worry about it, but

14:32.080 --> 14:36.800
you can go look at other people and there are some awesome videos on there. Like they have people

14:36.800 --> 14:41.440
dressed up in star Wars costumes, dancing to some of the songs, but I'll tell you that the cutest

14:41.440 --> 14:46.560
ones are people that have their kids singing the song. Like there's this little three-year-old girl

14:46.560 --> 14:55.920
singing a blink 182 dammit. And she's so cute doing it. She's like, she's so cute. And so

14:55.920 --> 14:59.840
that's the best part of the game is just going on like the YouTube type thing and looking at that.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.720
So I had fun with it. So, um, yeah, I don't know that it's not for everyone. Get it. If you have

15:04.720 --> 15:08.480
a lot of parties, but if you're a solo gamer, I don't think there's a lot here for you unless

15:08.480 --> 15:12.160
you like to sing to yourself. Um, otherwise I'm just holding out for a little big planet

15:12.160 --> 15:16.480
and I'll probably be going back to the three 60 in the meantime. However, I will say this, uh,

15:16.480 --> 15:22.240
PlayStation three has, I got to say that Blu-ray player is pretty awesome. Um, and it does upscale

15:22.240 --> 15:26.880
the old movies pretty good on DVD and the media server I thought was a lot easier to use the

15:26.880 --> 15:32.080
Microsoft's servers. I was really surprised that kind of surprised me. I was thinking that the

15:32.080 --> 15:36.320
three 60 media server would be a lot easier cause you know, hello windows, you know, Microsoft,

15:36.320 --> 15:42.640
no, the PlayStation three one was disgustingly simple. However, here's a word of advice for you

15:42.640 --> 15:46.720
folks. Don't run the media server and your internet connection at the same time. Cause

15:46.720 --> 15:50.400
it can't, your internet connection can't hold it on the PlayStation three. That's the one thing

15:50.400 --> 15:54.800
about it. So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week. Otherwise I haven't played a whole

15:54.800 --> 15:59.760
lot. Um, Aurora faint on the iPhone, which is pretty awesome for a free game. That game is

15:59.760 --> 16:04.480
all kinds of awesome. Huh? I had another game. What's that? I downloaded pull position remix.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.560
How'd you like that? Um, it's actually surprisingly easy to play, but I still suck at

16:08.560 --> 16:15.760
pole position. So, but the crashes and everything are fantastic. I suck the pole position. Uh,

16:15.760 --> 16:20.400
black Wolf in chat room says, uh, Rob, like confirmed Rob likes parents exploiting children

16:20.400 --> 16:29.680
on the internet. Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's cute. All right. If you don't do this,

16:29.680 --> 16:35.520
you don't get to eat. Um, and Ross to UT says, Rob, I have media server and internet running

16:35.520 --> 16:39.680
at the same time. No problem. Well, that's you. Congrats to you. All right. It didn't

16:39.680 --> 16:45.520
work right for me. I know my special, but now I have all the next gen systems. So there you have

16:45.520 --> 16:50.720
it. I did get, you know, if you got pole position on the phone, I will say I got Pac-Man on the

16:50.720 --> 16:55.520
iPhone, which is kind of neat. Cause you can do motion. You can tilt it. Yeah. It's kind of dumb.

16:55.520 --> 16:58.800
Like you play it once and then it's over. So just get the free trial. Don't pay for it.

16:58.800 --> 17:03.440
But, but the pole position one though, honestly, it really is playable. And on top of that,

17:03.440 --> 17:08.560
not only can you have it use motion, uh, use, uh, your tilt to turn left to right. You can choose

17:08.560 --> 17:15.200
to have your accelerator or your brake on screen. Um, or you can actually have a steering wheel on

17:15.200 --> 17:22.320
screen to steer with, or you can use a slider. So that's kind of cool. Um, looking in chat and I'm,

17:22.320 --> 17:27.280
I lied. I looked at Justin TV chat for a minute. Um, and the, a person by the name of Sony PS3

17:27.280 --> 17:31.360
sucks. So I'm sure it's just thrilled to hear my news this week says that jelly car is on iPhone

17:31.360 --> 17:34.800
for free. I forgot about that. I read about that somewhere. And that was actually a really awesome

17:34.800 --> 17:38.960
game on the XNA service. Um, the little beta thing they had there. So I really want to check

17:38.960 --> 17:45.840
that out on iPhone. So there you go. All right. Anyhow, uh, real quickly, uh, going around and

17:45.840 --> 17:49.520
seeing what other kinds of games, uh, people have been playing this week. Uh, Mel Chan,

17:49.520 --> 17:55.600
what's one game you've been playing this week? Sadly, my Japanese coach, your Japanese coach.

17:55.600 --> 18:00.160
Well, how, how exactly does it teach you Japanese? Uh, it's actually pretty neat. It's got an

18:00.160 --> 18:04.400
interface that you can trace the writing so you can really learn your brush strokes and stuff.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.880
It's got a bunch of fun little games to play that actually really have been helping my memory and

18:08.880 --> 18:13.360
helping me remember the shit that I learned a few years ago when I actually did take Japanese class.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.080
Would you say that it's something that somebody could pick up and learn Japanese with,

18:18.080 --> 18:23.280
or is it better a supplement to an actual Japanese class as a supplement to an actual Japanese class?

18:23.280 --> 18:28.000
But it is nice because it does have a dictionary and a phrase guide thing built into it. So if you

18:28.000 --> 18:31.200
are somewhere, you need to say something that you don't exactly know how to say. You can look

18:31.200 --> 18:34.320
up real quick and be like, this is what I need to say. This is how I have to say it.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.120
Awesome. Um, Drew, what's one thing you've been playing this week?

18:38.240 --> 18:44.080
World of Warcraft, the burning crew. Brains. We have a story coming on that later,

18:44.080 --> 18:46.400
but how, how's Wobbling? Are you excited about Lich King?

18:46.400 --> 18:51.600
Oh, very excited. I've been, uh, leveling with, uh, Camara lately. Uh, thanks to that

18:51.600 --> 18:55.360
recruit a friend thing, triple experience. She and I are going through Outlands as mage and warlock

18:55.360 --> 18:59.600
63. So far it's, it's a blast. What are you most looking forward to about Lich King?

18:59.600 --> 19:05.840
Uh, death knights, that and motorcycles. Awesome. Uh, the doctor who, by the way,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.720
brought us some mushrooms for the studio. I don't know if you can see them on Justin TV.

19:08.720 --> 19:14.080
Can you hold one up for the Justin TV folks? Uh, what the mushrooms look like here. There you go.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.000
Look at that. And, uh, those are awesome. Where did you make those just for this? Or did you

19:18.000 --> 19:22.640
steal those from your work? Last year, my work, we did Mario as a theme for Halloween. So, uh,

19:22.640 --> 19:25.520
one of my coworkers made them. Awesome. Well, thank you for stealing them and bringing them

19:25.520 --> 19:28.240
here. Um, what's one game you've been playing this week, doctor?

19:28.880 --> 19:32.560
Actually, Hiccup Boy has gotten me back into DDR, which, oh my God, that's like the best

19:32.560 --> 19:37.440
exercise ever. You've lost some weight too. Well, maybe like, yeah, just today. Oh my God,

19:37.440 --> 19:41.280
because my hand's all sweaty from DDR. What kind of DDR? What?

19:41.280 --> 19:45.120
Um, like it's old school DDR. It's like, like extreme DDR from like the arcade.

19:45.120 --> 19:50.800
So, but I love it. Like it's good. It's good times. It is. It's very good exercise. And I,

19:50.800 --> 19:54.480
I like though the here on our 300th episode, somebody brings up DDR. So thank you. Oh my God.

19:54.480 --> 19:58.160
No. And that's, I don't think a boy like you are the one of the DDR Kings. So there you go.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.520
There you go. Uh, Arcadian. What, what's one game you've been playing this week? I picked up,

20:01.520 --> 20:06.640
uh, Sonic Chronicles yesterday and play that a bit. Nice. It's actually pretty good. What system?

20:06.640 --> 20:10.640
So it's a DS DS. And that's like, what is all the old school, old school Sonic games?

20:10.640 --> 20:16.960
No, no, it's a new RPG. Oh, I thought it was actually called Sonic RPG. Okay. How is it?

20:16.960 --> 20:20.560
Good. It's pretty good so far. I've played like a, like three or four hours. You just

20:21.840 --> 20:24.800
halfway the second mission. Is there any other RPGs you can kind of compare to?

20:26.480 --> 20:32.320
I don't know. It's a little bit different cause, cause you're kind of moving around with the

20:32.320 --> 20:37.200
stylus and the, cause you're not, and actually cause there's an interesting system where you,

20:37.200 --> 20:41.520
if you, you got to chase, sometimes you have to chase the enemies or run away from them. So you

20:41.520 --> 20:47.520
have to basically have the characters running away or running towards the, uh, the, uh, the enemy.

20:47.520 --> 20:52.000
So you have to like make them jump over boxes and stuff. So that kind of, so if you need to escape

20:52.000 --> 20:55.360
from an enemy, you're going to kill you. You can try to do that. Or if they want to get away from

20:55.360 --> 21:00.160
you, you have to chase them. So if you got four characters, it's really hard to sometimes to

21:00.160 --> 21:06.080
actually keep everyone from hitting the boxes so that they don't, that they can catch up.

21:06.080 --> 21:11.440
Cool. It sounds like this game might be redeeming the Sonic franchise a little bit after a relatively

21:11.440 --> 21:16.560
last few week years. I actually haven't played any of the games and it's for the best. It's for

21:16.560 --> 21:19.920
the best Bradley. If you want to stay a Sega fan boy, you probably should stay away from him.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.840
All right. Uh, let's also ask Kick Up Boy. Uh, what, what's, what's one game you've been playing

21:23.840 --> 21:30.720
this week? Well, um, I kind of haven't, haven't gotten over, um, Cod 4 at all yet. All right. A

21:30.720 --> 21:37.120
shooter fan. It's amazing. Except you get those people that just like, Oh, on one on one, I can

21:37.120 --> 21:43.680
kick your ass. And then we go on one on one and they leave shortly after that. So what would you

21:43.680 --> 21:51.840
say is the singular best thing about that game? The best thing is gotta be just, Hmm. Uh, there's

21:51.840 --> 21:59.040
not just one, uh, you looking forward to the COD five. Yeah. Yes and no. Just, they kind of went

21:59.040 --> 22:03.440
back in time. So I'm kind of like, Oh, I feel like a back to the future kind of thing. What's

22:03.440 --> 22:09.360
something they need to do in COD five they didn't do for four. Um, they need to, um, make sure no

22:09.360 --> 22:15.280
juggernaut is allowed. Cause that's just kind of wimpy. All right. There you have it. All right.

22:15.280 --> 22:19.840
Um, we're going to move into some, uh, news here, but after some housekeeping here real quick.

22:19.840 --> 22:24.960
And, uh, first off I want to say, you know, cause I say it every week, join us on a live journal.

22:24.960 --> 22:29.920
Our username on life journals, orange lounge or a my space where orange lounge radio, uh, on

22:29.920 --> 22:34.320
Facebook or the OL army. And now on Twitter, we're OLR. Yes. That's four different sites and four

22:34.320 --> 22:39.520
different names. Go figure. It just never works out. Um, also I want to say this, uh, since we

22:39.520 --> 22:44.960
have been doing this diligently for 300 episodes, uh, we are taking next week off. There will be no

22:44.960 --> 22:51.760
show next week. So there you have it. Cause we earned it. We will be providing live footage of,

22:51.760 --> 22:56.400
um, a colonoscopy. No, I'm not. Here's the, here's the deal. I'm not having a colonoscopy,

22:56.400 --> 22:58.960
but you guys might remember if you've been listening to the show this year, I had some

22:58.960 --> 23:03.520
medical issues, um, back in April, um, that kept me out of the show for a week. Uh, I'm having

23:03.520 --> 23:06.560
surgery Wednesday and that's why there's not going to be a show on Sunday because I'm still

23:06.560 --> 23:10.080
going to be recovering. Um, I'm having a gallbladder removal. I'm sure I mentioned

23:10.080 --> 23:13.840
this a couple of weeks ago. It's not a big deal. Other people have had it done. It's laparoscopic,

23:13.840 --> 23:17.840
so it's not going to be a big deal, but I am planning to pretty much be out of everything

23:17.840 --> 23:23.040
for a week. So there you have it. So now you understand. So no, no kicking and screaming.

23:23.040 --> 23:27.200
There's no show. Take a chance to play some more games or listen to one of our other

23:27.200 --> 23:34.560
wonderful shows, uh, that we co broadcast with on all games radio. Um, so let's move into some

23:34.560 --> 23:39.360
gaming news then tonight, I think if we're ready. Yes. All right. All right. Uh, well,

23:40.160 --> 23:45.680
you may remember the, uh, new PSP 3000 was announced and is finally made it to the market.

23:45.680 --> 23:53.440
Um, although it's not really being received that well, um, problem is apparently the new advanced,

23:53.440 --> 24:00.400
um, LCD screen that's on it is causing some issues with scan lines, noticeable scan lines,

24:00.400 --> 24:07.920
and it looks very bad. Um, it is now a little bit brighter and the colors are a little bit better,

24:07.920 --> 24:14.240
but the scan lines look like crap and Sony is apparently looking into the problem right now.

24:14.240 --> 24:23.760
Um, but no sort of fix is, um, being, uh, taken, you know, being done. And, um, so since this is

24:23.760 --> 24:28.080
a phenomenon that is caused by hardware characteristics, there is no plan to fix it

24:28.080 --> 24:36.720
with the system software update. So you might want to hold on to those PSP 2000s and forgo the

24:36.720 --> 24:45.520
built-in, um, microphone and I don't know, better, uh, questionably better LCD screen.

24:45.520 --> 24:48.480
Or maybe just wait a little while for it to get fixed. Is it possible that they're

24:48.480 --> 24:54.800
going to like kind of fix these? Um, they're going to have to replace them if that's the case.

24:56.480 --> 25:02.480
Interesting. Um, well, what's kind of interesting also is that it seems like there might be some

25:02.480 --> 25:08.800
type of very, uh, quiet under the radar recall going on right now. Um, I guess it's because

25:08.800 --> 25:13.040
people are, you know, complaining about this and apparently the description actually got like this

25:13.040 --> 25:18.640
slight word change going on. Um, instead of saying the system features an improved LCD screen,

25:18.640 --> 25:23.600
it says the system features an advanced LCD screen. So you can kind of see that they might be,

25:23.600 --> 25:27.520
uh, kind of admitting that there's something going on there. It kind of reminds me of was it, uh,

25:27.520 --> 25:32.640
if anyone's watched Invader Zim when he's introduced to his sidekick Gur, he's like,

25:33.440 --> 25:37.600
um, he kind of looks broken. They're all, he's not broken. He's advanced.

25:40.160 --> 25:44.800
Well, here's the other interesting thing is that amazon.com just suddenly canceled a bunch of

25:44.800 --> 25:49.600
pre-orders for the PSP 3000. Um, some folks had the limited edition four gigabyte memory

25:49.600 --> 25:53.760
entertainment pack for this thing reserved. Amazon sent everybody emails that said, um,

25:53.760 --> 25:58.720
that the item was not available from the sources so that they canceled all the orders.

25:58.720 --> 26:05.840
Yeah. In fact, we got some similar that, um, they were expected in probably this week, I guess,

26:06.480 --> 26:13.040
but now they've been delayed to middle of January. So there's something going on. Something

26:13.040 --> 26:18.160
is afoot at the circle K. All right. So there you have it. Um, I don't know what's going on with the

26:18.160 --> 26:23.360
PSP 3000, but maybe you want to be cautious, play a friend's system, play it in stores and see if

26:23.360 --> 26:27.120
it's something that bugs you that bad, because I bet to a lot of gamers, um, they're not going

26:27.120 --> 26:32.080
to give a shit to be honest. I mean, it looks pretty bad. I mean, but there's a lot of PSP

26:32.080 --> 26:37.840
2000 systems out there and really all you're supposedly improving is the, you know, inner

26:37.840 --> 26:42.480
the LCD screen, which obviously is not improved this time and a built-in microphone. So if

26:42.480 --> 26:46.960
microphones aren't really big deal for you, I mean, you can go buy one for like 20 bucks.

26:46.960 --> 26:53.200
I don't know. So I would just maybe hold off. Besides, why do you, why do you need to buy

26:53.200 --> 26:58.720
another system? I mean, after all the last system update came about a year ago. All right. Well,

27:01.200 --> 27:06.080
what was that? She didn't have a mic. I said, not to mention, there's hardly any new PSP games

27:06.080 --> 27:09.840
coming out. They're like, here's a bunch of new systems without you. We've got like 20 games

27:09.840 --> 27:16.320
coming out in the next six months. Have fun. All right. Well, we'll see. We'll see what continues

27:16.320 --> 27:19.920
to develop, um, over there and hopefully some PSP games, a lot of good stuff in, um,

27:19.920 --> 27:25.520
2009. We'll see. That could possibly be, but honestly, you know, my opinion on the PSP

27:27.360 --> 27:32.800
actually is the same opinion I have on any system. It stinks only as good as the games that are on

27:32.800 --> 27:40.640
it, but it does have purple lacrosse, which is a cute game. Okay. Well, this comes as an absolute

27:40.640 --> 27:47.680
surprise to no one. Um, because what do you just like gasping into the microphone as if you're in

27:47.680 --> 27:54.800
a porn? I'm no one. I'm no one. Do that. Do that a little bit more throaty. No, no, no, I don't.

27:54.800 --> 28:02.400
No, no. Okay. Sorry. Anyway. Thank you, Rob. Now you have to mimic the master here.

28:02.400 --> 28:11.440
No, I don't. Anyway. Um, well there was, um, the game was trademarked in July, but there is going

28:11.440 --> 28:17.200
to be a Star Wars, the old Republic, which is the MMO that's based off of KOTOR, Knights of the Old

28:17.200 --> 28:23.840
Republic. Also the term coined by our friend Krista Skrotor when she worked for Lucas back

28:23.840 --> 28:30.720
in the day. Anyway. Um, with this, um, it says to be 300 years after, um, Knights of the Old Republic

28:30.720 --> 28:36.720
two, which is 3,500 years before the film. And you can choose between either the Republic or the

28:36.720 --> 28:44.720
Sith empire. You can either, um, be, uh, light side or dark side. Um, but you can be one of those

28:44.720 --> 28:52.400
alignments within whatever your faction is. So I guess you could be chaotic neutral or lawful evil

28:52.400 --> 28:57.760
or, Oh, wait, wrong game. Anyway. Um, there's two classes that have been revealed already. That's

28:57.760 --> 29:04.720
the Sith, the Jedi, and they use lightsabers and the force. And we have no idea when it's coming

29:04.720 --> 29:11.440
out or what it's coming out on, but, but, but, well, can I kill Jar Jar Binks? Jar Jar has not

29:11.440 --> 29:17.440
been born yet or conceived. She could probably find, can I find Jar Jar's super great ancestor

29:17.440 --> 29:25.520
and killer and super great cut off the fishy cock. That's the fishy cock.

29:25.520 --> 29:31.120
Did you just tell me to go slice off the fishy cock? Fish do not have cocks. They deposit their

29:31.120 --> 29:35.360
things into the ocean. But they're supposed to be human led creatures. So I assume that there's

29:35.360 --> 29:42.560
some cock involved. There's always cock involved. They're aquatic. Okay. Needless to say the

29:42.560 --> 29:48.320
internet and the gamers on the internet all had a, needless to say the collective internet gamers

29:48.320 --> 29:53.520
had a giant orgasm when this game was announced. Um, all their fish cocks went off at once.

29:53.520 --> 29:59.680
Uh, I know there's a fountain of, there's a lot of people definitely looking forward to a KOTOR

29:59.680 --> 30:05.680
MMO. A fountain of time ago. I've heard there are people that are going to leave wow for this.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.520
We'll see, just like you and I are going to go play Star Trek. But I'm not leaving wow because

30:09.520 --> 30:15.360
guess what? I am. I already left. I know. Fuck your KOTOR. We've got Star Trek MMO coming out.

30:15.360 --> 30:19.680
We're going to have some Star Trek. There's a Star Trek MMO coming out? Where the fuck have

30:19.680 --> 30:24.080
you been? Can I cream my shorts right now? Because I love Star Trek so much. Can you stand up so I

30:24.080 --> 30:30.960
can see? Star Trek Online. This is still Star Trek Online. But what time period? Uh, after

30:30.960 --> 30:37.360
current. I think it's set like 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. Oh

30:37.360 --> 30:43.120
man. So you get your own joystick for your ship. Or the Klingon Empire again though. No. Yes. All

30:43.120 --> 30:47.920
right. And Janeway's dead and Picard's dead. Well Janeway could still be alive. Sounds awesome.

30:47.920 --> 30:57.440
She can. All right. Anyhow. What? You can do customizing on your ship. So you can uh,

30:57.440 --> 31:01.520
calibrate the dilithium crystal. And I want there to be an achievement called Red Shirt Massacre.

31:02.960 --> 31:08.000
What? Oh wait. If it's set in that series. Okay. If it was red shirts first and then yellow in

31:08.000 --> 31:14.720
Next Generation, then what color are they going to go to for the next series to come out? Magenta.

31:14.720 --> 31:20.800
Magenta shirts. No. All right. I'm going to get some questions or some comments from chat.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.480
Rasteel UT says, what I'm concerned about with Old Republic is that A,

31:24.480 --> 31:29.360
virtually, this virtually guarantees no KOTOR 3 and B, Bioware's never done an MMO before. I

31:29.360 --> 31:35.840
can't shake the idea that they might try to ape WoW. WoW's a good game. Let's see. We also have

31:36.960 --> 31:41.600
GS68 says, I was going to get a PSP 3000 for Christmas, but I think I'll just save for a

31:41.600 --> 31:47.520
desktop arcade pop and con. We'll see. SJ100 Matt says, I'm waiting for the OLR Starfleet.

31:49.840 --> 31:55.840
All right. Let's move on with some more news. Back to PlayStation 3. Well, PlayStation Home

31:55.840 --> 32:02.240
isn't even out yet and it's already been hacked. So, you know, just like anything else that's Sony,

32:02.240 --> 32:08.880
especially the PSP, it has been hacked. The beta client has apparently been decrypted and hackers,

32:08.880 --> 32:18.880
especially this guy I guess named streetskaterfu, apparently he has decrypted over 9,000 files

32:18.880 --> 32:25.040
belonging to it and this is supposedly going to lead to better understanding how PlayStation 3

32:25.040 --> 32:31.440
games and the PlayStation Network works and its structure. So apparently it's all backend stuff

32:31.440 --> 32:36.880
and it'll allow you to, well, they're going to hopefully allow it to lead to other exploits and

32:36.880 --> 32:42.400
possibly custom stuff for the cross media bar and all that fun stuff. I don't know, right now it's

32:42.400 --> 32:47.040
a whole bunch of nothing, but it's progress and progress is always good, I guess. You know what

32:47.040 --> 32:53.280
I think is hilarious? That these people do this as a hobby. You know what? I bet the one, I bet

32:53.280 --> 32:59.120
the best way to end all the hacking and everything is to offer these guys jobs. Oh no, they wouldn't

32:59.120 --> 33:05.920
do that. It would actually be original content. We don't want that. Pay them. We want rehashes

33:05.920 --> 33:12.640
of everything. Yeah, but how long before Sony tries to close this gap? I mean, the home's not

33:12.640 --> 33:20.640
even out yet really. Yeah, not very long, but you know, hey, I don't know, it's neat I guess. It's

33:20.640 --> 33:26.960
fun to say, hey look, I hacked home. Hey, I'm skaterfu, I hacked home. But what's kind of neat

33:26.960 --> 33:34.000
though, speaking of the home beta, if you do want to get into the home beta, just keep an eye out

33:34.000 --> 33:39.520
for the next issue of Core, which is going to do some features behind the scenes regarding home,

33:39.520 --> 33:45.200
and they're also going to have home beta entries. So you will be able to test home before home

33:45.200 --> 33:48.960
launches, whenever home actually launches, although it's probably going to launch soon.

33:48.960 --> 33:53.200
Well, do you remember on last week's show, there was a big to-do about the whole censorship in the

33:53.200 --> 33:59.680
game LittleBigPlanet, and how one of the songs controversially quoted the Quran in its lyrics,

33:59.680 --> 34:03.280
and Sony was going to patch, they were really nervous about this, they're going to patch the

34:03.280 --> 34:09.680
game, take the lyrics out. It was retarded. Well, here's the thing, it's kind of an interesting

34:09.680 --> 34:14.160
follow-up to this whole thing, is that we're kind of waiting for comment from the other side, like

34:15.200 --> 34:18.640
what's the community going to think, what's the rest of the Muslim community going to think if

34:18.640 --> 34:22.080
this word gets out there, this is in the game. Well, you might be surprised at what happened.

34:22.800 --> 34:29.600
M. Zoudi Jasir, MD, and he is the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy,

34:29.600 --> 34:34.880
he talked to a website called Edge Gaming, or the Edge Game Network, and he said something

34:34.880 --> 34:40.720
kind of interesting here. He said that censorship and Sony being willing to bend at the request for

34:40.720 --> 34:45.920
censorship is counterproductive to the freedom of speech. Let me give you this quote, to demand that

34:45.920 --> 34:51.360
the game be withdrawn is predicated on a society which gives theocrats who wish to control speech

34:51.360 --> 34:56.240
far more value than the central principle of freedom of expression upon which the very practice

34:56.240 --> 35:01.440
and freedom of religion is based. The fact that the music writer is a devout Muslim should highlight

35:01.440 --> 35:05.680
that at the core of this issue is not about offending all Muslims but only about freedom

35:05.680 --> 35:10.880
of expression and the free market. He says he himself does not endorse the use of the

35:10.880 --> 35:17.360
Quran verses in non-educational video games, but he says in this case basically that the

35:17.360 --> 35:22.800
first amendment takes precedence and that the Islamic foundation stands against all forms of

35:22.800 --> 35:27.600
censorship. So, interesting. I think that's beautiful and isn't that sort of what we said

35:27.600 --> 35:34.640
last week? In a way, in a way, so it's uh it's it it is kind of interesting to see that now Sony

35:34.640 --> 35:39.280
has almost a little bit of egg on it they just can't win with this. Rice Princess was called and

35:39.280 --> 35:47.040
she said censorship equals... Thank you. Is she coming tonight? Actually she's she's sick so she's

35:47.040 --> 35:51.040
gonna try to make it. Isn't she far princess now? Yeah she is far princess. No she's sick she's

35:51.040 --> 35:55.200
gonna try to make it though. All right. But you know everybody say a fire princess. All right.

35:56.560 --> 36:01.280
All right. Let's move on and talk about some uh oh by the way just real quick note on Little

36:01.280 --> 36:06.480
Big Planet the 1.02 patch is out now and uh it basically just strips the lyrics out of the song.

36:06.480 --> 36:11.440
Yeah it doesn't take the song out just removes the lyrics which is fine. There you go. Because

36:11.440 --> 36:15.600
I didn't understand what they meant anyway so we're right here. Didn't didn't they have a

36:15.600 --> 36:20.960
very habit to do about this way back in the day with that game War Gods didn't they didn't uh

36:20.960 --> 36:24.800
when the tracks in that game quote the Quran or something they took that out. Oh who knows.

36:25.680 --> 36:29.120
This has been an issue for a while with other games you'd think people would learn.

36:30.160 --> 36:34.880
I honestly... It just seems like bullshit to me the whole time. It really is. Oh sorry I should

36:34.880 --> 36:41.040
be watching my language. Oh fuck that okay. It's like I said last week if they wanted to

36:41.040 --> 36:44.000
be offended at somebody they should have been offended at the artist that made the song

36:44.000 --> 36:49.280
who which I think is completely retarded anyway since he himself as stated was a devout Muslim so

36:50.400 --> 36:54.080
whatever. Yeah but isn't that so he he was a Muslim the guy that wrote the song because there's like

36:54.080 --> 37:00.080
you know like there's Ninju and that's made like by a Jewish guy like have you seen Ninju? No.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.520
No I haven't. All right before we unravel more controversy on the program tonight

37:03.520 --> 37:09.280
let's get to some release dates. Dark Sakura. Hey. Take us to the UK. In the UK we have Jesus

37:09.280 --> 37:15.760

dates over there on the Xbox 360. Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, Fracture and Grand Theft

43:00.800 --> 43:06.800
Auto IV all coming out this week. Again, that's Xbox 360. On the PlayStation 3, I imagine very

43:06.800 --> 43:12.640
similar stuff. Yes, Fracture is also coming out on the PlayStation 3, as is Grand Theft Auto IV.

43:12.640 --> 43:18.800
I guess some type of... No, is that the new one? No, we're waiting for V, aren't we?

43:20.000 --> 43:24.960
So, I don't know why this is just now coming out. Grand Theft Auto IV? Oh, never mind. I'm getting

43:24.960 --> 43:29.200
confused because right above it I'm reading Grand Turismo. Never mind. Hello. Okay, so yes, Japan

43:29.200 --> 43:34.880
finally gets their version of Grand Theft Auto IV. Grand Turismo V Prologue does come out in Japan

43:34.880 --> 43:39.920
this week. Spec 3. And Little Big Planet also makes its way to Japan this week on the 30th.

43:39.920 --> 43:47.440
And Grand Turismo V Prologue hasn't come out in... This is Spec 3, so it's probably like new...

43:47.440 --> 43:53.200
It's probably different cars to get people to buy it again. Sorry. Hey, now wait a minute.

43:53.200 --> 43:57.280
Sorry for the use of that term, but that's gay. Seriously. Wait a minute, wait a minute,

43:57.280 --> 44:01.040
wait a minute, wait a minute. I need to play something for Loki. Hold on, stop the show.

44:01.040 --> 44:04.720
Stop the show. I need to play something for Loki here.

44:04.720 --> 44:14.080
Hey, check out this shit, right? Right? It's so gay. It's really gay. Look at those pants.

44:14.080 --> 44:19.440
Please don't say that. What? Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something

44:19.440 --> 44:26.480
is dumb or stupid. It's insulting. It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said,

44:26.480 --> 44:34.000
man, this pepper shaker is so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache. Just saying. When you

44:34.000 --> 44:41.600
say that's so gay, do you realize what you say? Knock it off. She's so sassy. Me too.

44:41.600 --> 44:47.760
All right. Her show got canceled, so she sucks. I love her. I just downloaded one of her routines.

44:47.760 --> 44:54.960
All right. That's all right. I completely understand, you know, the use of, you know,

44:54.960 --> 44:57.920
gay and stuff, but I know, I know. I'm just messing with you. That's the whole point. I

44:57.920 --> 45:02.160
know you don't really mean it. On the Nintendo Wii, nevermind. I'm not going to get political

45:02.160 --> 45:09.040
right now. Nintendo Wii, My Sims Kingdom comes out this week, as does Bokuju Monogatari,

45:09.040 --> 45:16.880
Waku Waku Animal March, yay, on the Wii, as well as Hula Wii, Mina Di Furo Odoro,

45:16.880 --> 45:22.480
and Shape Boxing, We Day Enjoy Diet. It's probably Everybody Hula Hoop,

45:24.160 --> 45:28.960
which would be a very interesting game. I don't know how you make a game out of that.

45:28.960 --> 45:35.600
Hey, on the PlayStation 2, Scarlet, Nichijou no Kaiyou Kaisen comes out, as well as Thunder Force

45:35.600 --> 45:44.000
6 comes out from Sega, and Yumemi Hakusho, Second Dream makes its way to the PlayStation 2.

45:44.720 --> 45:51.040
On the Nintendo DS, ChocoBox comes out, Dr. Slump and Arale-chan.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.960
Is ChocoBox chocobo-boxing? Because that would be amazing.

45:54.960 --> 45:58.240
Dr. Slump was done by the artist that did Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.

45:58.240 --> 46:00.800
Ah, there you go. It is chocobo-boxing.

46:00.800 --> 46:02.960
Let's get back to boxing with ChocoBox.

46:02.960 --> 46:07.440
ChocoBox is not a game. It's a case for your DS.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.840
What are they making chocobo-boxing?

46:11.840 --> 46:12.720
That'd be pretty awesome.

46:13.920 --> 46:18.240
Tales of Innocence gets a price reduction, and a game called Vitamin Y comes out.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.400
Why? Because.

46:21.920 --> 46:26.080
Lastly, on the Sony PSP, is there anything coming out this week?

46:26.080 --> 46:29.440
Well, you actually would be surprised. Yes, there's quite a bit coming out this week.

46:29.440 --> 46:34.880
Cardinal Arc Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G gets a price reduction into the best,

46:34.880 --> 46:36.960
as does Rockman Rockman.

46:38.480 --> 46:41.360
That would just be, you know, you know how they remade Mega Man 1 for the PSP.

46:41.360 --> 46:41.860
It's just that.

46:42.640 --> 46:43.360
It's that whole thing.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.920
All right, that's it for Japanese release dates.

46:45.920 --> 46:47.840
Let's go back to some more gaming news.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.720
Do we gotta?

46:48.720 --> 46:49.360
Yes, we gotta.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.480
Well, this is about death.

46:53.200 --> 46:53.700
Cool.

46:53.700 --> 46:56.740
ULTIMATE FINAL CHARACTER DEATH.

46:58.180 --> 47:06.180
A 43-year-old Japanese woman was arrested for killing her virtual husband on MapleStory.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.860
I know, where's our stupid person music, Rob?

47:11.380 --> 47:13.460
Wait, did she kill him in-game?

47:13.460 --> 47:15.300
She killed him in-game.

47:15.300 --> 47:16.020
Oh, okay.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.700
But she got arrested for killing him in-game?

47:18.500 --> 47:19.620
Or did she kill him for real?

47:19.620 --> 47:20.340
Here's what happened.

47:20.340 --> 47:21.140
No, she killed him in-

47:21.140 --> 47:21.620
She-

47:21.620 --> 47:22.340
This is what happened.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.020
She, um, she's a piano teacher.

47:26.900 --> 47:34.340
43-year-old piano teacher was furious because, um, she had been divorced in-game.

47:35.540 --> 47:40.020
So she accessed his login and deleted his character.

47:41.380 --> 47:44.180
So she killed him in-game.

47:44.180 --> 47:51.380
She's, um, in jail in Sapporo, um, and she's facing charges of illegally accessing a

47:51.380 --> 47:52.980
computer and manipulating data.

47:53.460 --> 47:57.300
Um, her in-game husband was a 33-year-old office worker.

47:57.940 --> 48:04.180
And, um, I, I really don't know what he thinks, so there's no comment about that.

48:04.180 --> 48:10.020
But this happened last May and, um, the woman could, um, pay fines and potentially

48:10.020 --> 48:12.100
a five-year jail sentence if she's convicted.

48:14.740 --> 48:16.020
Dude, it's MapleStory.

48:16.020 --> 48:16.740
Who gives a shit?

48:16.740 --> 48:17.380
God, I know!

48:17.380 --> 48:20.660
Isn't that the biggest irony in this whole crappy story?

48:20.660 --> 48:21.540
It's-

48:21.540 --> 48:22.580
Get over yourself!

48:22.580 --> 48:24.100
It's fucking MapleStory.

48:24.100 --> 48:26.020
And besides that, what does it matter?

48:26.020 --> 48:26.900
Oh my God.

48:26.900 --> 48:27.380
Thank God.

48:27.380 --> 48:28.420
I hope I can't-

48:28.420 --> 48:31.860
She probably deleted, like, a couple years worth of data and-

48:32.500 --> 48:35.140
I hope I can't be held accountable for all the people I killed.

48:35.140 --> 48:36.660
You spend time working on that kind of shit.

48:36.660 --> 48:39.380
DJ Dark Knight says it's a huge crime in Japan.

48:39.380 --> 48:41.380
I- no, look, this is the thing.

48:41.380 --> 48:49.300
I, I understand it and honestly, I, I would, you know, want some sort of, you know, retaliation.

48:49.300 --> 48:51.220
She did break the law.

48:52.180 --> 48:57.460
She illegally accessed his information and she broke the law.

48:57.460 --> 49:02.980
However, I just think it's so fucking retarded that this is MapleStory!

49:04.260 --> 49:04.820
It's free!

49:05.860 --> 49:06.340
It's Ma-

49:06.340 --> 49:06.980
Okay, okay.

49:06.980 --> 49:10.900
I would be pissed off if someone did that to my Ragnarok account.

49:10.900 --> 49:13.380
I would be pissed off if that happened on my Ragnarok account.

49:14.340 --> 49:18.180
You know, but it's not the end of the world.

49:18.180 --> 49:19.540
Five years in jail?

49:19.540 --> 49:22.180
I mean, God, pissing you off is bad enough.

49:22.180 --> 49:22.900
Can you imagine the phone call?

49:22.900 --> 49:25.060
What do you mean pissing me off is bad enough?

49:25.060 --> 49:27.540
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Rob?

49:27.540 --> 49:28.100
Exactly.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.620
Exactly as it was intended.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.620
Can you imagine the, the phone call?

49:31.620 --> 49:34.580
I'd like to report a murder of my character in MapleStory.

49:34.580 --> 49:37.220
Okay, see, I was thinking of the World of Warcraft-

49:37.220 --> 49:37.860
Hello?

49:37.860 --> 49:38.980
Uh, South Park episode.

49:41.380 --> 49:44.660
It's like, and, and he's killing people's characters.

49:44.660 --> 49:48.020
Mom! Bathroom! Bathroom!

49:50.260 --> 49:51.860
I am such an achievement, Hornau.

49:52.500 --> 49:54.820
Um, anyhow, hey, let's move on with the news.

49:57.460 --> 50:00.660
Sorry, I've been distracted because the doctor has boobs now.

50:01.380 --> 50:02.740
And boobs are distracting.

50:03.380 --> 50:04.180
Uh, anyways-

50:04.180 --> 50:04.580
Ew.

50:05.220 --> 50:05.540
So-

50:05.540 --> 50:07.540
So that's what kind of doctor you are.

50:07.540 --> 50:08.340
That's a doctor.

50:08.900 --> 50:09.620
Hello, doctor.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.260
Now, um-

50:10.260 --> 50:10.660
Doctor.

50:10.660 --> 50:18.260
Apparently, Guitar Hero World Tour is facing some drum issues, um, as some other, um, hosts,

50:18.260 --> 50:21.380
uh, so, uh, viciously-

50:21.380 --> 50:23.620
Eloquently put it on previous shows.

50:23.620 --> 50:29.780
Viciously described, um, there's some issues with the drums, um, not sensing the hits,

50:29.780 --> 50:30.740
um, in this case-

50:32.260 --> 50:34.340
Sorry, that's to come later, ignore that.

50:35.620 --> 50:38.500
I let the, I let the audio run too long again, my bad.

50:38.500 --> 50:38.900
Shame, shame.

50:38.900 --> 50:41.220
Fucking drums aren't fucking working right.

50:41.220 --> 50:43.140
Anyway, so the drums aren't working correctly.

50:43.140 --> 50:49.540
Basically, they're either not sensing hits, or they're just playing, not doing anything.

50:49.540 --> 50:51.380
They're faulty like this show.

50:51.380 --> 50:52.500
They're very faulty.

50:53.300 --> 50:57.940
I mean, personally, I kind of called that they were faulty, but for whole different

50:57.940 --> 50:58.340
reasons.

50:58.340 --> 51:02.820
I mean, the thing looks like it's made out of PVC, and was seriously, like, rocking when

51:02.820 --> 51:05.220
people were playing it, and not rocking in the good way.

51:05.220 --> 51:07.540
But, I don't know.

51:09.460 --> 51:14.180
I think as, uh, Bobby Blackwolf put it on his show, if they're gonna brag that their

51:14.180 --> 51:18.500
instruments are better than, you know, Rock Band's instruments, then maybe they should

51:18.500 --> 51:18.820
work.

51:19.940 --> 51:21.780
Let's start with the working first.

51:24.500 --> 51:27.060
That's the only sound my, uh, Guitar Hero drums will make.

51:27.060 --> 51:29.620
I have, I have pumpkiny goodness in me, by the way, Rob.

51:29.620 --> 51:30.100
Thank you.

51:30.100 --> 51:30.820
You're welcome.

51:30.820 --> 51:33.060
We're eating pumpkin bagels here in Studio Justino.

51:33.060 --> 51:33.460
We are?

51:33.460 --> 51:34.580
I am.

51:35.380 --> 51:36.020
Yeah, that's fine.

51:36.020 --> 51:37.780
Actually, eat that Halloween candy.

51:37.780 --> 51:39.620
I can't have the candy, and John doesn't want it.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.460
So, bring the thing out here.

51:41.460 --> 51:42.660
Make everybody eat it.

51:42.660 --> 51:43.700
Give some to Justin TV.

51:43.700 --> 51:44.580
I don't care.

51:44.580 --> 51:44.980
All right.

51:44.980 --> 51:47.140
Hey, um, big news this week.

51:47.140 --> 51:47.620
Oh, my God.

51:47.620 --> 51:52.180
Huge news about, um, something, uh, we here at Orange Mountains Radio used to cover every

51:52.180 --> 51:53.460
year, and then kind of stopped.

51:54.100 --> 51:55.780
E3 is coming back.

51:56.740 --> 51:57.300
That's right.

51:57.300 --> 52:00.660
E3 2009, uh, is coming back the way we know it.

52:00.660 --> 52:05.300
Not this whole, like, scale down show we had, um, going on.

52:06.100 --> 52:11.060
This whole scale down show we had going on for just the media only, and the super special

52:11.060 --> 52:12.900
secret club invite is going away.

52:14.020 --> 52:15.300
Basically, I hope so.

52:15.300 --> 52:17.300
E3 is going to be just like it was before.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.260
However, that doesn't mean that anybody's going to be able to get in.

52:20.260 --> 52:21.460
It's not public.

52:21.460 --> 52:24.260
It's just, you know, it's going to be back to the same audience.

52:24.260 --> 52:24.660
Come on.

52:24.660 --> 52:27.700
When it was originally going on anyways, it was almost public.

52:27.700 --> 52:32.260
It's like I work at Walmart or I know someone that works at Walmart in the garden department

52:32.260 --> 52:36.180
because they, you know, it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or something like that.

52:36.180 --> 52:41.380
It's like I work in a store that looks at video games and therefore, you know, I should

52:41.380 --> 52:41.940
be able to go.

52:41.940 --> 52:43.620
I have a crappy podcast on the internet.

52:43.620 --> 52:44.820
It's been going for six years.

52:44.820 --> 52:45.700
I get to go.

52:45.700 --> 52:46.340
What?

52:46.340 --> 52:50.020
This means that we need to get our business stuff set back up.

52:50.020 --> 52:51.300
Yeah, we got to go.

52:51.300 --> 52:52.340
We're going.

52:52.340 --> 52:52.820
It'll be fun.

52:52.820 --> 52:54.500
Yeah, that's going to be tough.

52:54.500 --> 52:58.260
I'm going to try to get the wife to let me go, but uh, ouch.

52:58.260 --> 52:59.140
Tell her Fable 3 will be there.

52:59.140 --> 53:00.900
This is how it works at my house.

53:00.900 --> 53:02.260
Hey Dan, I'm going to E3.

53:03.620 --> 53:04.020
Okay.

53:04.020 --> 53:05.140
Yeah, but you can do that.

53:06.100 --> 53:06.980
He can come with me.

53:07.940 --> 53:10.020
By the way, he's come with me every year.

53:11.620 --> 53:16.180
The website Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q, actually interviewed the president of the

53:16.180 --> 53:21.540
ESA, Doug Lowenstein, and he actually said if you had to give, they asked him if you

53:21.540 --> 53:26.020
had to give E3 a six letter word or less tagline, what would it be?

53:26.020 --> 53:27.140
And uh, I'm sorry.

53:27.700 --> 53:30.660
Doug Lowenstein was the former president of the ESA.

53:30.660 --> 53:31.860
Now it's Mike Gallagher.

53:32.740 --> 53:33.780
Sorry, my bad.

53:33.780 --> 53:35.140
I just haven't been to E3 in so long.

53:35.700 --> 53:39.940
Mike Gallagher calls it the must attend event of 2009.

53:41.140 --> 53:41.940
That's what he's calling it.

53:42.580 --> 53:45.220
And they're saying it's going to be 40,000 or more in attendance.

53:46.020 --> 53:47.860
I believe that the last E3 was 70,000.

53:47.860 --> 53:48.980
And then they're complaining.

53:48.980 --> 53:53.140
Why are there so many people going in there and then Paris Hilton will be there pimping

53:53.140 --> 53:53.780
out whatever.

53:53.780 --> 53:55.940
I want to know what's the heavy cynicism for there in the back.

53:58.900 --> 54:05.140
When it was an industry only thing, it still was going down the tubes and you had better

54:05.140 --> 54:10.260
things like, you know, Leipzig and uh, PAX as the true gamers conventions.

54:11.140 --> 54:14.820
I mean, even for the industry, it's just not that good anymore.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.460
I'm kind of curious what effect this is going to have on PAX.

54:17.460 --> 54:20.100
If that's going to cause less people to want to go to PAX now, because they'll want to

54:20.100 --> 54:21.700
use their vacation on E3.

54:21.700 --> 54:23.780
Cause not everybody can take vacation all the time.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.580
You know what I mean?

54:24.580 --> 54:28.820
Honestly, if I had to choose between the two though, to be perfectly honest, I want to

54:28.820 --> 54:29.700
go to PAX again.

54:29.700 --> 54:30.900
I really want to go to PAX again.

54:30.900 --> 54:32.260
You know, PAX was a lot of fun.

54:32.260 --> 54:35.220
PAX was more of like the gamer show, but I'm a greedy bastard.

54:35.220 --> 54:35.940
I'm going to go to both.

54:35.940 --> 54:36.420
Hello.

54:36.420 --> 54:37.780
No, I'd love to go to both.

54:37.780 --> 54:43.060
I'd especially like to see what this E3 revival is, you know?

54:43.060 --> 54:47.700
But if I had to pick between one or the other, I would pick PAX.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.500
There you go.

54:48.500 --> 54:52.500
Uh, so orange launch radio live from E3 this June.

54:52.500 --> 54:52.900
What?

54:52.900 --> 54:55.540
If we do go to E3, we're totally freaking going to Disneyland.

54:56.420 --> 54:57.380
We'll see what we can do.

54:57.380 --> 54:57.860
We are.

54:58.660 --> 54:59.300
Yes, ma'am.

55:00.900 --> 55:03.700
Cause I, so what?

55:03.700 --> 55:04.260
Tea cups.

55:05.140 --> 55:07.700
Tea cups for the win and California screaming.

55:07.700 --> 55:07.940
All right.

55:08.500 --> 55:11.060
Let's move on with the news or we'll never get to Disneyland.

55:11.060 --> 55:11.300
Yes.

55:11.300 --> 55:14.980
But, you know what Disneyland could use more of?

55:14.980 --> 55:15.540
Zombies!

55:16.340 --> 55:18.100
You know what Call of Duty is getting more of?

55:18.100 --> 55:19.940
Um, my story.

55:20.500 --> 55:21.140
Well, I'm sorry.

55:21.140 --> 55:23.620
You were just talking about Disneyland and I stopped listening.

55:23.620 --> 55:24.120
Okay.

55:24.980 --> 55:25.480
Go ahead.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.900
Well, it was E3's revival.

55:28.900 --> 55:30.180
What happens to E4All?

55:31.060 --> 55:32.980
It gets flushed down the toilet.

55:38.020 --> 55:39.300
I don't have a toilet flush noise.

55:39.300 --> 55:43.540
Yup, there's no more E for All and I'm laughing my ass off.

55:43.540 --> 55:46.340
Why? Why all the negativity? There's too much cynicism in here tonight.

55:46.340 --> 55:50.340
I'm just laughing my ass off at all the people who said that, um,

55:50.340 --> 55:53.980
that E for All is gonna be the end all, the place to go,

55:53.980 --> 55:56.980
and we're gonna be all at E for All. And I'm like...

55:56.980 --> 56:01.100
Well, it definitely was the end all. Fuck you, I'm going to PAX.

56:01.100 --> 56:05.860
Nice. But seriously, I've heard from so many people about

56:05.860 --> 56:09.220
oh, E for All this and E for All that and I'm like, screw you.

56:09.220 --> 56:14.740
But they had fatality. Whatever. We got to, we got to do fatalities in

56:14.740 --> 56:18.940
DC vs Mortal Kombat, okay? Oh my god, we got someone who holds his, holds his mouth funny.

56:18.940 --> 56:22.900
Rob and I got to have the Katana Catwoman fight and that was

56:22.900 --> 56:27.980
epic. It was pretty cool. Plus, I got to meet Jonathan Coulton and Wil Wheaton and

56:27.980 --> 56:29.740
I couldn't do that at E for All.

56:29.740 --> 56:33.180
Uh, Jenai in chat makes the, uh,

56:33.180 --> 56:36.340
mandatory joke here that I think is pretty clever. E for End.

56:36.340 --> 56:39.940
Did you hear that one, Jenai?

56:39.940 --> 56:44.940
E for End. Aww, that's perfect. I was telling Mel about Wil Wheaton signing my iPhone

56:44.940 --> 56:47.060
and it rubbing off by the end of the day. But you saw it.

56:47.060 --> 56:51.500
I did see it. I'd said, now my phone is an extra limited edition and so he

56:51.500 --> 56:53.060
put a 1 slash 1 on it.

56:53.060 --> 56:58.300
That was pretty funny. Alright, now we can talk about zombies.

56:58.300 --> 57:02.940
That's what, because that's what you're going to see at E3 this year. A bunch of unshowered, unslept zombies.

57:02.940 --> 57:06.380
We should hand out care packs.

57:06.380 --> 57:10.900
Okay, no, we should, we should hand out con care packs like they did at AX that one year

57:10.900 --> 57:15.180
where they handed out deodorant and soap. Yeah, but unless you're going to put it on them

57:15.180 --> 57:19.020
yourself, it's not going to do any good. What's this? Cans of

57:19.020 --> 57:24.540
Axe. I can't use this, start away. Axe smells freaking good. Axe is better than confunk.

57:24.540 --> 57:27.500
Confunk is good. Confunk is...

57:27.500 --> 57:31.140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know what smells better than confunk?

57:31.140 --> 57:35.140
Cat piss. I'll take your word for it. How about zombies?

57:35.140 --> 57:41.340
Yes, zombies. Apparently the megaton bomb that was dropped by Game Trailers TV

57:41.340 --> 57:42.340
was that

57:42.340 --> 57:46.340
Call of Duty World of War is going to feature a four-player co-op zombie mode.

57:46.340 --> 57:50.060
That totally doesn't rip off of another game that's very similar having a

57:50.060 --> 57:51.100
four-player co-op

57:51.100 --> 57:54.260
zombie mode in it. Left 4 Dead.

57:54.260 --> 57:57.260
So I guess, you know, hey they want to make sure that people know that their game has

57:57.260 --> 57:58.380
zombies too.

57:58.380 --> 58:04.820
Wow, that's so World of War. You know, I remember the zombie wars back in World War II.

58:04.820 --> 58:08.420
My grandpa used to tell me all about those, how the zombies would attack and

58:08.420 --> 58:08.980
everything.

58:08.980 --> 58:12.700
Ah, yes, the zombies.

58:12.700 --> 58:16.940
Thank goodness that we, you know, defeated them and showed them democracy.

58:16.940 --> 58:20.740
Democracy! Bringing it to the rest of the world. And

58:20.740 --> 58:26.460
no zombies, because zombies are bad. But thankfully though Treyarch is able to come

58:26.460 --> 58:27.540
back and tell the

58:27.540 --> 58:30.900
you know, lost battles of zombies. You know,

58:30.900 --> 58:34.700
the part that was left out of the history books. Conspiracy, I say!

58:34.700 --> 58:39.220
No, but seriously, they're going to have four-player zombies and you'll be able to do

58:39.220 --> 58:42.420
zombie stuff. Can you eat brains? Yes or no?

58:42.420 --> 58:47.300
Well this sounds like it's basically, it's kind of weird though. There's a whole bunch of

58:47.300 --> 58:49.220
games this fall that have zombie things in them. Like

58:49.220 --> 58:53.700
Saints Row 2 has zombies in it. There's like a zombie game within the game.

58:53.700 --> 58:57.700
And now there's a zombie game within this. And then there's a zombie game coming out.

58:57.700 --> 58:58.420
There's zombie

58:58.420 --> 59:02.180
Xbox Live Arcade games. Zombie PlayStation Network games. It's like, seriously,

59:02.180 --> 59:03.140
Moonwalker!

59:03.140 --> 59:07.580
Brains or no brains? Actually, I do have to say there's something that completely

59:07.580 --> 59:09.260
bothers me about zombie games.

59:09.260 --> 59:13.300
About games with zombies in them. How you don't have a stench meter.

59:13.300 --> 59:16.420
In zombie movies and zombie games,

59:16.420 --> 59:21.100
why is it that you can't tell where the fucking zombies are by how much their decayed

59:21.100 --> 59:25.300
asses stink? They're decaying bodies. They're going to smell

59:25.300 --> 59:29.020
like rotten meat. Maybe someday there'll be a smell-o-vision.

59:29.020 --> 59:33.220
But, you know, nobody in zombie movies are so surprised that the zombies are there

59:33.220 --> 59:38.220
when they should have been able to freakin' smell corpse stench. Yeah, I know. You have games like, I don't know,

59:38.220 --> 59:42.620
Thief with sound meters. Why can't you have smell meters? Maybe there's a lot of zombies and so

59:42.620 --> 59:46.100
because they all smell like rotting flesh, the whole place smells like rotting

59:46.100 --> 59:49.300
flesh so you can't tell where it's coming from. It should still be stronger the closer you

59:49.300 --> 59:50.240
get to that much

59:50.240 --> 59:53.700
contained stench. It's just... It's like an anime con.

59:53.700 --> 59:57.700
It's just like last night. You can tell when you're getting close to the dealer's room

59:57.700 --> 01:00:02.420
by the stink. No, no, no, no. You can tell when you're getting close to the cosplay

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.500
competition

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.160
It's like a Dave Matthews Band concert. You can tell when you're getting close to

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.500
the smell of marijuana.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:13.460
No, when you're getting close to the cosplay competition is when you stop

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:13.980
smelling

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.540
funk and start smelling other things. I don't know if you heard Drew, but

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:20.540
the Grateful Dead. The one guy's keeping on trucking in heaven.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:24.540
I don't know if you've heard. Alright. He's gratefully dead.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.300
Anyhow. Unless he's a zombie! In which case,

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.500
you need to know how to defeat zombies by playing this game. Or

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.420
Left 4 Dead. Or Saints Row 2. Or another zombie game. World of Warcraft.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.820
Which has also started the zombie invasion. That's right. Zombie invasion has been hitting World of

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.960
Warcraft and there's been just craziness going on.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.180
Earlier in the week, there was infections going on. If you would kill an

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.180
infected critter

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.380
or the like, you would get turned into a zombie in 10 minutes and then you

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:53.900
could create other zombies. It was like a disease that was spread around.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:57.980
Well, as the week's been going on, now it takes 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:01.860
15 seconds? I thought it was one minute. No, that happened to me earlier today. It took me 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.060
The more you get hit by zombies, the faster they shave off

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.340
times. You gotta visit an Argent healer.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:12.620
Or if they haven't been turned into a zombie. Or you have a priest or paladin

01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:16.580
remove the disease. All last night I was going on my priest

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:20.580
through Orgrimmar making sure all the auction house street dealers were

01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.420
clean. Yeah, apparently it's a popular thing to do is turn yourself into a zombie and then do

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:28.360
a zombie explode. Because one thing you can do, you can just explode. You can self-destruct as a zombie

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.100
and spread your infection everywhere. So a lot of people have just been walking into the

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.060
auction house and exploding.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:39.060
And apparently they don't like the people who are cleaning up after the

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:39.740
zombies.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.420
They don't like the priests. They don't like the pallys. Oh, you're ruining our fun.

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.740
Hi, you guys are going to low-level zones and killing everything. Exactly.

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.900
You know, does anyone find this slightly offensive that there's

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:55.380
people walking around into, I don't know, public buildings and exploding?

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.940
I mean... There's zombies. Don't blame them, there are zombies.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:02.380
Everything is okay when it's zombies and green blood.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.060
It's not real. There were zombies that ate too many Twinkies. So if some zombies flew a

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.300
plane into a building, that would be okay too.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.780
They're zombies! Matt... I'm just checking.

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:16.860
Alright, because this is the World of Warcraft game that you're playing, and I don't see any

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:18.220
recalls on that. Yes, alright.

01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:21.620
Well, we did have people getting infected and then

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:24.900
flying to other cities and then exploding when they got there. The

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.220
zombified in mid-flight.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:31.080
You can't explode in mid-flight? They can't explode in mid-flight, but they can explode as soon as they land.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.780
Tenris Murkblood is a new boss that you can fight in Karazhan. My guild just took him

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.700
down today, and it was actually a fun fight.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.180
But you only are going to be able to see him for 10 days, which basically means if

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.980
you don't play him tonight or Monday,

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:46.900
you have one chance because of the resets in Karazhan. So, he drops an axe that is

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.580
awesome. He will drop this axe every time. He only drops two things. A little bat pet for

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.520
everybody in the raid,

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:55.500
and an axe that when you use it,

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:59.140
your character suddenly becomes a zombie or an undead, basically.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.420
It starts jamming like it's Guitar Hero. It goes...

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.860
It's awesome. Rob, get an extra one.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:11.820
We can't. Only Nathan got one today. Look at that! Now they're ripping off Darkstalkers! Awesome!

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.780
Arcanite Ripper!

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.020
Arcanite can rip off.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:19.940
Yeah, and I see XLink in chat says, Grand Theft Auto IV has zombies too.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:23.500
Yeah, they started putting out this thing like it was going to be an expansion or something like that,

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.700
but really they're just talking about the stupid

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:30.580
viral achievement that they've had since the beginning of the game, when it came out.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.100
And...

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:36.980
Tom, talk about like non-news, but they decided, hey, we're going to jump in on the zombie

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.660
fun as well, even though

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.180
this has been around forever. I want to point out, since we just started tonight's show,

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:45.660
a new phase just kicked in. Phase five and a half just started tonight

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:49.580
as we went live. Apparently what's happened, now there are quests all of a sudden

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.580
available in the main cities that send you to the faction leader,

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:57.260
and at some point you're going to be whispered by some type of either

01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.740
a frozen shade or a plagued brain that's going to be taunting you to join their

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.860
forces.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:05.260
And there's some type of quest going on to hopefully clean the world

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.660
of the plague. Interesting.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.460
So it's all going on right now in the world of Warcraft.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.740
Bathroom.

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.860
Bathroom.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:20.460
More gaming news.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:25.060
Well, there's another game called Pain,

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.100
and there is a character showing up in Pain

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:34.140
that you can beat the shit out of. Guess who that would be?

01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:38.220
I don't know. David Hasselhoff!

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:41.500
And he actually thinks that it's

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.700
completely, he actually said that it was hysterical, he's quoted as saying that,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.220
and that

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:50.620
he thinks that it's really great that he gets to be in it.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:55.320
And there's also his version of Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.920
as

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:02.340
the title to an in-game track, so I think that's pretty fun. Wow, you know that's just...

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.180
What the fuck was that? Rob's computer farted. I don't know what's going on. Well, hello

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:10.940
Rice Princess, glad to see you just arrived. I think a zombie is attacking us, actually.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:15.300
What the hell was that about? That was some weird shit. Anyways, I was going to say,

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.540
that's reason enough to hurt him.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.220
Well, also he's doing his own voice, so this information was provided to me by

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.180
the lovely and talented Zoss.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:29.220
Now I want to point out there's a new song available in Pain.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:34.220
I can't stop this feeling

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:38.220
deep inside of me

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.220
Girl, you just don't realize

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:44.220
what you do to me

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:48.220
I couldn't resist. You gotta love a guy that actually is famous for doing that shit.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:52.220
I mean, seriously, you know what, it's like, I wonder if he's just like,

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.220
what can I do that's so ridiculous that people would still like me? And he keeps

01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:00.220
making these songs and he's like, okay, people gotta hate me now. And then they're still like

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.220
buying his albums and he's still rich and putting them on TV shows and stuff.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:08.220
I don't know.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.220
He's still convinced that he's instrumental in the Berlin Wall coming down.

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.220
Rama in chat says... They love him in Germany. Rama in chat

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.220
says, I actually like this song. I only read that so that our, you know,

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.220
thousands of listeners could hear that. That's Rama, R-A-N-M-A, likes that song.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.220
DSSJ100 Matt says, we got Hofrolled.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.220
Yes you did. Yes you did. Alright, a little

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:36.220
more gaming news than the classic Game of the Week and then a break.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:40.220
If you bought Rock Band 2, you'll know that on the back of your manual, it says you can get 20

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:44.220
free tracks available at a later date. Well, that later date is

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.220
now November 4th and there are 20 different tracks you can get.

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:52.220
And to be honest, I don't know any of these artists at all.

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.220
So, real quick I'm going to read them off. The 88 Sons and Daughters.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.220
Authority Zero, no regrets. Between the

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:04.220
Buried and Me, prepare to the sequel.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.220
The Cab with Bounce. The Chevelle's, get it on.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.220
The Cocktail Slippers, give it to me. Dealership

The Feeling. The Len Price 3,

If I Ain't Got You. Lesley Roy, I'm Gone, I'm Going.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.220
Opiate for the Masses, Burn You Down.

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.220
Semi-Precious Weapons, Magnetic Baby.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.220
Shamius with Like a Fool. Magnetic Baby?

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:48.220
I don't know. The Nuno 2, Crazy Tuesday.

Tickle Me Pink with The Time is Wrong.

01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:56.220
Under oath with Desperate Times, Desperate Measures, and X Japan with

01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.220
IV. I have no idea any of those songs.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:04.220
I know that actually we were really excited about getting some X Japan.

01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:08.220
But hey, at least they're free, and free is awesome.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:12.220
No bitching, it's free. And there might be some cool songs in there that you've never heard of before.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:16.220
So make sure that you register before the 4th, I mean you probably can afterwards, but if you

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:20.220
want to make sure you get it day 1, register at rockband.com slash

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.220
bonus tracks, and they will send you an email with your code

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:28.220
to download them once they become available.

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:32.220
Awesome. What about what they're releasing for the people that want to pay?

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.220
Well, for the people that want to pay, there's going to be some other stuff coming out as well.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:40.220
Including, they've got Hong Kong Gardens,

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:44.220
Kiss Them For Me, and Killing Jar.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:48.220
Yay! And that's all by Soozee and the band Cheese.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.220
Yay! Which is like one of the greatest bands ever. Dammit by Blink

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.220
182, that song that Rob was talking about the little girl singing earlier

01:08:56.220 --> 01:09:00.220
in Sing Star. Let's see here, looks like

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.220
Metal Onan by the Silver Star, or Silver Sun

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:08.220
Pickups. Well Thought Out Twinkies by

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.220
or Twinkles, Twinkies would be funny though. Well Thought Out Twinkles

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:16.220
by Silver Sun Pickups, and Pretty In Pink by Psychedelic Furs.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:20.220
That's cool. You know what though, who cares, because it has Soozee and the band Cheese

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:24.220
in it, so all the rest of that is just crap.

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:28.220
Oh my god,

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:32.220
Rob are you straight now? No, I just

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:36.220
love Soozee and the band Cheese, they're awesome. She was on the Basement Jacks song too.

01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:40.220
They had a really cool video on top of it.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.220
There you go. Kish Cash. It's funny, my band right now

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:48.220
thankfully, because I'm not playing Rock Band 2, but my friend is on my account

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:52.220
so it counts, but we're in the top 600 now.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.220
Wow. Dang. Yes, I know, I'm

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.220
very pleased at my progress in the game. Oh, just to let

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:04.220
people know, our band name at my house is Detachable Penis.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.220
Like the King Missile song. Did it not get banned? No. Interesting.

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:12.220
The one I've been playing in mostly is actually Shane's band, it's Emergency Kittens.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:16.220
That's the name of our band. Does the Sassy Squad sing backup? No.

01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:20.220
That's just a Warcraft fan. But is Fluffles Trainset the third?

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:24.220
No. Alright, hey, by the way

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:28.220
if you want a real band game, you know, the hell with Rock Band or Guitar Hero

01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:32.220
get Rock Revolution. No, I'm kidding, I'm just so kidding. No, you want this

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.220
Strong Bad Episode 3, The Baddest of the Bands

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.220
is coming out. It's Episode 3, it comes out on the PC and WiiWare

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.220
when? Right now. Or Monday for those of you listening live, it's tomorrow.

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:48.220
October 27th, it's going to be as always 1,000 Wii Points or

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.220
$10. That's coming out from Telltale Games. So there you have it

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:56.220
those of you that are enjoying the Strong Bad games probably want to pick that up. And if you haven't

01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:00.220
picked up a Strong Bad game yet, you might want to do that. And yes, I'm talking to myself

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:04.220
because I still have not played the Strong Bad series. I really need to. Is the

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.220
ban over, Rob? No, you know your boycott's not over yet, is it? No, I can play it on PC.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:12.220
That's right. So that's what I plan to do. Oh, your boycott, because your memory

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:16.220
is full. Yeah, I'm boycotting the Wii download stuff. Your memory is full. Although, well

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:20.220
I don't know, I'm iffy on it because they have announced the remedy for it.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:24.220
Wait, what did, have you already announced that on the show, what the remedy is? Yeah, they

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.220
did announce they are going to let you run things off SD cards. But when's that happening, though?

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.220
That's a thing. So that's going to be a patch, right? Yeah, probably a patch. Alright, anyhow

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.220
hey, we're not even halfway done with this show yet, if you can believe it. We're going to take a

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.220
break here pretty soon. But first, we always like to end part A of our program by

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.220
taking a trip to the past and revisiting the archives and

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.220
trying to pick out a classic game of the week. Now, as I understand

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:52.220
though, tonight's game, because it is episode 300, Dark Sakura had to

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:56.220
pick like a fucking epic classic. Am I correct? I sure did.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.220
Alright, well let's get to it.

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:04.220
My classic game, actually I'm not going to say the title of it to

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.220
begin with. It should begin with the intro to the game.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:12.220
Which everyone will get from the first Tones.

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:16.220
And I'm getting grins from over here looking at my laptop.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:20.220
Oh my god. Oh my god.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:24.220
Oh my god.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:28.220
Oh my god.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:32.220
That only sounds like a porn star.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:36.220
Oh yeah. Do we get it yet

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:40.220
kids? Oh yeah. No it's not Castlevania.

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:44.220
It's Gutsman.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:48.220
Oh yeah. Tora is the first person to guess.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:52.220
And stop spamming the room now please. You get a no prize.

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.220
Stop it! Okay, someone kick Tora out of the chat room please.

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.220
Right the fuck now.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:04.220
Thank you. Okay, the classic game is Final Fantasy

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:08.220
6, which we got over here on Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy 3.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:12.220
Play the best music in the game ever please.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.220
This is the overworld music, which is also called Terra's theme.

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:22.220
Although in the Japanese version her name was Tina.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:26.220
Best music in the game. Sorry.

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:30.220
That's just my own opinion. And Sausa's best game ever.

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:34.220
I think this is probably one of the best video game songs ever.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:38.220
This game is the reason why I skipped a week of high school.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.220
While I had the flu. But that's beside the point.

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:46.220
My flu was prolonged. No, no. I started off having the flu and my grandma rented the game for me.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:50.220
And I ended up just having the flu a little bit longer than I really did.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.220
But the one thing about this one is it was the first in the series

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:58.220
that was not done by Sakaguchi. It was done by Yoshinori Kitase

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:02.220
and Hiroyuki Ito. And this is

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.220
considered pretty much the pinnacle of it. Although I really, really like Final Fantasy 5

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:10.220
a whole lot too. It has the largest

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:14.220
playable cast of any Final Fantasy game to date.

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:18.220
Pretty much it's standard Final Fantasy.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.220
You have your overworld map and you have your dungeons and you have

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:26.220
your towns and you've got your chocobo

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.220
and you have your airship and random encounters on land.

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.220
This one also has your

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.220
espers which give you your magic and you keep improving.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.220
And it's still menu based combat. I mean it's Final Fantasy

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:46.220
basically. There were a few different

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.220
innovative attacks. Like Selle's had the runic attack which could reflect

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:54.220
magical attacks back at somebody.

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:58.220
Although I'll be honest, I rarely ever freaking use that except for that one battle where you had to.

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:02.220
And I'm actually still playing this right now too.

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:06.220
But this has, for the active time

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:10.220
battle system, you actually can pick any character that has

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:14.220
filled up their action bar and you don't have to pick

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:18.220
the first one that pops up. You can actually change out which one you want to use as long

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.220
as their bar is their first.

01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:26.220
And this actually was incorporated into later ones. You could customize

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.220
your characters by your relics to change their stats.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:34.220
You could work with their spells a little bit. You could equip their

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.220
magicite which is like I was saying is basically some of the espers

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:42.220
helps with magic. They have the magic acquisition points for each time.

01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:46.220
You gain APs. You level up. This particular game

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:50.220
is where basically you've got

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:54.220
this one girl named Terra in the Japanese version. It was

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:58.220
Tina. And they find her and she can do magic.

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.220
And everyone's like, Oh my god! Magic! I'm going to barf! And then the rest of the story

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:06.220
comes off. This also has Kefka which is the

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:10.220
most annoying laugh

01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:14.220
in a video game ever.

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:18.220
Somebody poison the water hole!

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:22.220
But he had the best boss theme ever.

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:26.220
Actually I really like Jenova's better. But anyway.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.220
The one other really cool thing that I thought about this game is that it's very

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.220
punk. Really it is. I mean you've got

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:38.220
steam powered mecha in the game. It's all very

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:42.220
early industrial. Magitek. You have your magitek armor.

01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:46.220
You've got you know the empire in that is pretty much

01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.220
a magical industrial type

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:54.220
mesh. I know it's so fantastic. And you have toilets in it. You can use the toilet. Did you know that?

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:58.220
What if you don't use the toilet? Because in Sims that's not good.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:02.220
If you're in the empire castle or whatever

01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:06.220
and you're in one of the cells you can actually sit on the toilet and squat down on it.

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.220
And then when you hop off the toilet it flushes.

01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:14.220
Do they take down their little pants to do that?

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:18.220
No they have a trap door. They do? Okay.

01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:22.220
Also Saw says it has the freakiest clown in a video game ever.

01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:26.220
But you've got some of the best characters in this.

01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:30.220
I actually really liked

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:34.220
GoGo. I really liked GoGo.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:38.220
Because of the weird stuff he did. I loved Gal who was the

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:42.220
little feral boy. And Mog wasn't

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.220
you get Mog.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.220
I don't know why we're having mic issues in studio.

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:54.220
Is it? Oh keep it away from interference. I'm sorry. But Rob do me a favor

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:58.220
Alright I'll try to find it.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:02.220
This game had the single most hardcore awesome character in it.

01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:06.220
Which was um. We'll get to him in a second.

01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:10.220
But the main characters you have Terra slash Tina. You've got Locke who's your thief.

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:14.220
You have Sillies who's treasure hunter.

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:18.220
You have Sabin who's your martial artist.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.220
This is a special rendition of it. Oh no wait. Here we go.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:26.220
But here's the man.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:38.220
Shadow the ninja. Who we used to call Snake Eyes.

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:42.220
And you have Realm was cool. She had the drawing

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:46.220
attack. And you had her grandfather who's the blue mage. And you had

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:52.220
what's-his-face who looked like Billy Dee Williams.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:56.220
Who was the Doma castle guy.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:00.220
But he looked like Billy Dee. Sorry he looks like Billy Dee Williams.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:04.220
Edgar was the best. I bet he does. Edgar was awesome.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.220
Because it was all about the autocrossbow.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:12.220
And the chainsaw.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:16.220
And the graphics actually were

01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:20.220
the characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano and they were

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:24.220
actually converted to sprite.

01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.220
And there were also

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:32.220
in the Playstation version that came out later

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:36.220
the actual videos that were in the game

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:40.220
were directly from Amano's designs. That was pretty cool.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:44.220
It was one of the, it's not the first one that used mode 7 but it used

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:48.220
extensive mode 7 in this for lots of

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:52.220
scaling and scrolling. It was really fantastic.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:56.220
When it was localized there were changes

01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:00.220
like a little bit of nudity. For

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.220
example. One of the painting bosses.

01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.220
Yes one of those. Also

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.220
different characters for their full names. They romanized them differently

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:16.220
so that they would fix a six, fit a six character slot.

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:20.220
They were also changed quite a bit from Terra to Tina from

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:24.220
Mash to Sabin. From Kayen to Sion.

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:28.220
But I think that they

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.220
picked it in the way that people would most be able to

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:36.220
relate to it. Text, a lot of

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:40.220
dialogue was shortened. Because again

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:44.220
it could only store a certain number of characters

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:48.220
and I'm sorry Japanese lends itself a lot easier to extended conversation

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:52.220
within a limited character allotment because it's syllabic and

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:56.220
English isn't. This

01:20:56.220 --> 01:21:08.220
is so awesome.

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:12.220
This is the opera scene which is

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:16.220
to this day I think one of the most memorable ever scenes

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:20.220
in any video game ever are.

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:24.220
It really is. Did you see

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:28.220
what they did for the Dear Friends concert

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:32.220
where they did the opera scene

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:36.220
in Japanese. I saw YouTube of it. It was just

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:40.220
fantastic. It was so beautiful. And here's actually

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.220
one that we should realize

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.220
about the music. We've kept bringing up the music during

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:52.220
this. It was actually done by Uematsu

01:21:52.220 --> 01:21:56.220
who wrote all of the music in the game.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:22:00.220
Did everything for every location, all the battles

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:04.220
different themes. They actually use the music

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:08.220
from the games in Japanese music classes in Japan.

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.220
Also they wanted to

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:16.220
use an actual voice for the opera but the SBC

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:20.220
700 chip would not allow an actual

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:24.220
voice track so that's why they used

01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:28.220
the...well it would basically be

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:32.220
the Vox Organa or Vox Humana thing

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:36.220
for organ is what I recognized.

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.220
The sound chip itself didn't support the voices but later on

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.220
you had games like Tales of Fantasia and Star Ocean that did have

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.220
actual voice samples. But we're talking about full vocal track.

01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:52.220
It wouldn't support a full vocal track. It would support

01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.220
something that was short.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.220
The last Metroid is in captivity.

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:04.220
The galaxy is at peace. It's about as much as you can get.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:08.220
Or the clay fighters opening.

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:12.220
For the Final Fantasy 6 Grand Finale

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.220
album it actually was rearranged as an aria using

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:20.220
an actual singer in full

01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:24.220
accompaniment and this version was also in the full motion

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.220
video in the Playstation version so it was pretty cool.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:32.220
You can actually get...I've got the full soundtrack

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.220
to this. You can get all kinds of arranged versions but there's also

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:40.220
some pretty good versions of this

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:44.220
some of the music in the game and some of the Final Fantasy compilation

01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:48.220
discs. Although I still think

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:52.220
that the best of the compilation ones, which I don't think has any from this game in it, is still

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:56.220
Celtic Moon and Prey was very good. Prey had some stuff in here.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:00.220
We did, like I said, we got a Playstation version

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:04.220
but there's also Final Fantasy 6 Advance

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:08.220
which came out on DS. There's four new espers in this one which is

01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:12.220
Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar and Diabolos.

01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.220
I think it was on Game Boy Advance. Sorry, that's the Game Boy Advance one.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:20.220
I wish it was on DS, that'd be awesome. Yeah, well that's the one I've been playing through until my

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:24.220
DS broke. Also

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:28.220
for this game, as of March 31, 2003

01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:32.220
it shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide

01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.220
which is 2.6 million in Japan alone and

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:40.220
860,000 overseas and continued to be one

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:44.220
of the best selling games of all time. Did you, in that week that you were home

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:48.220
with it, did you beat it in the week, did you play it like non-stop? No, I didn't actually.

01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:52.220
You should have. I've had tons of other stuff to do. I'm in school, dude.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:56.220
Anyway, another neat thing about this though

01:24:56.220 --> 01:25:00.220
and this is what made me all hyper, is that when

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:04.220
I don't know if you remember when the Nintendo 64 was in

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.220
production, or sorry, when testing, they actually made

01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:12.220
a demonstration for the Nintendo 64 using

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.220
the cast from Final Fantasy

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:20.220
7 in a big battle, I think versus Bahamut

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:24.220
which I found video of finally and it's freaking crazy looking.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.220
Which is what we're looking at right now in studio. It was gonna be too expensive, right, to put

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:32.220
on a cartridge to do the game, right, for Final Fantasy 7?

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:36.220
Well, basically it was actually done on Silicon Graphics hardware

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:40.220
when they first put it out, but Square hadn't yet committed

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:44.220
and the technology in the game was

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:48.220
not up to their parts. They actually wanted to move it to PlayStation for the sake of full motion video.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:52.220
Which the PlayStation, of course, could easily handle.

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:56.220
But the demo actually had

01:25:56.220 --> 01:26:00.220
Terra, Locke, and Shadow.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:04.220
And it was controlled actually through using a mouse

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:08.220
instead of, you know, actual, like with a control.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:12.220
There was also Final Fantasy 6, the interactive CG game

01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:16.220
which was actually also called Final Fantasy X.

01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.220
Not a Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X.

01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:24.220
Which was the same demonstration, but with

01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:28.220
better touch-ups, textures.

01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:32.220
Oh no, this was basically...

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:36.220
But this was basically what they were using.

01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:40.220
It was a sort of

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:44.220
touchdown version that they were using for the Nintendo 64

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:48.220
demo test, but this was more

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:52.220
to demonstrate the actual use of CG in the

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.220
thing, so that's pretty cool.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:00.220
So that's our classic game is Final Fantasy 6.

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:04.220
Oh good, because I was running out of music. That was long. That's alright. It's worth it.

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:08.220
That game deserves it. I knew that this game would require a ton of

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.220
attention, so

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:16.220
how could we not dedicate more time to it? And it's Episode 300.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:20.220
I mean, hell, we have to pick the pinnacle. Alright. I don't know how you're going to follow that

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:24.220
next week. Alright. Because it's not better than Super Metroid.

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:28.220
Whatever. You know what? Honestly, you know, I actually like

01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:32.220
Final Fantasy 6 even more so than I do Chrono Trigger, so if any game you're going to say competes

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.220
for the best game of all time next to Super Metroid, I could see Final Fantasy 6.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:40.220
I would actually say Final Fantasy 6 is overall...

01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:44.220
Now, I used to say I really liked Final Fantasy 5

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:48.220
a whole lot, and I'll probably do that as a later game, because

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:52.220
of how customizable the job change system was, and Final Fantasy 3 was the

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:56.220
first one to do that of the Japanese releases, which was actually

01:27:56.220 --> 01:28:00.220
really fun, too. If anyone can find a translation of it, play it. It's fantastic.

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:04.220
Well, they've got it on DS. They have it now, but I mean, like, the old one.

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:08.220
But Final Fantasy 6, I think, for storytelling,

01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:12.220
for just how drawn in it brings you into everything, for

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:16.220
all the detail, and I mean, flushing toilets, a first for any Final Fantasy

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:20.220
game. I mean, but with the opera, by the time you get to the opera, there's

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:24.220
like this epic, crazy stuff, and so much has gone on already, and

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:28.220
you just, you're like, oh my god, this is some crazy adventure.

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:32.220
Plus, it's all about the

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:36.220
X-Zone. And the Vanish

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:40.220
Doom. No, it was...

01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:44.220
X-Zone was the one I used, but it was all about that.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:48.220
Alright, we're gonna wrap up, or we're gonna have no time for Skype calls in Part B. We're gonna

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:52.220
move on and take a break, but hey, don't go away. There'll be plenty more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.220
Some more news coming in Part B. We've got a new technology Microsoft might be

01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:00.220
building so that people will stop swearing on Xbox Live. I can't wait to see what people

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:04.220
have to say about this. Yeah, I know. Aw, fuck. Alright. So anyway,

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:08.220
we'll be talking about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:12.220
And for those of you guys

01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:16.220
listening live tonight, we have, for tonight's free break, your shout outs

01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:20.220
from our voicemail. So enjoy. We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:24.220
Music

01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:28.220
Music

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:32.220
Hey all our crew, happy 300k. Here's the turnaround of all our

01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:36.220
legendary DSX-B8. Yes, this voicemail is about the

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.220
value of the all our tech, or the never-ending trans class in DMN case.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:44.220
Hey, hey, hey! What's up? Dan Chateau here.

01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:48.220
So, 300. Episode

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:52.220
300. Wow. 300. Really?

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:56.220
I can't even get one. Can't get one?

01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:00.220
Just one. Really? No.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:04.220
300. Wow, man. Cool.

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:08.220
Yeah. 300. Sure.

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:12.220
Okay. Bye. Okay. Hi, it's

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:16.220
Goldampero. I haven't really left a message to

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:20.220
talk to you guys for a while, but I'm, and even though I'm probably

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:24.220
going to be there, I'm probably not going to be there just because of the stupid school reasons.

01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:28.220
So, hope you guys, your 300 episode is really good and I'll

01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:32.220
send it on the podcast. Anyway, real quickly, I want to tell my game

01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:36.220
spot so I can stop the story. Basically, there's one for the whiteboard.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:40.220
I went once with my mom a couple months ago,

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:44.220
and what happened was, well,

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:48.220
I got sent. We were waiting in line,

01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:52.220
and the lady was, we had to wait 10 minutes, they were

01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:56.220
ignoring us, and we were at the front of the line at the counter,

01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.220
and then they had the nerve to ask,

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:04.220
the nerve to ask, do you want to buy an edge cart with that, because you're 10% discount?

01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:08.220
My mom was like, no, and then we walked out. I mean,

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:12.220
after making us wait 10 minutes, we could tell they were pretty much a little bit

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:16.220
ignoring us, and you know, I know it's a bit busy, but

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.220
I mean, it's just so annoying.

01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:24.220
So there's one for the game spot, stop, whatever

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:28.220
message board thing. Sorry it was a little over a minute. Later.

01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:32.220
What's up, Orange Mouse Radio? This is Tigerclaw. I'd like to congratulate

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:36.220
you all for the 300th episode. Keep up the good fight.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:40.220
Take care. Alright? Well, happy 300th!

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:44.220
Or as we say in French,

01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:48.220
30, 30! Oh well, hell. Anyway,

01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:52.220
hi there, O.L.R., this is SakiRipper just calling you to say

01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:56.220
happy 300!

01:31:56.220 --> 01:32:00.220
300 after the arms jargon. That was Swedish.

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.220
So, oh well, hell. You're us at a later date.

01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:09.020
Hello there, Orange Mouse Radio, this is DMN, co-host of Under

01:32:09.020 --> 01:32:13.020
Shadow, and host of the old DMN Sanity. Yee-haw!

01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:17.020
Anyways, I'm calling to congratulate you guys on 300 episodes.

01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:21.020
That is a fantastic match. You guys are amazing.

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:25.020
I look forward to 300 more, and I know everyone else

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.020
listening is, so congratulations once again on 300, and

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:33.020
don't rob for too much, kids. Anyways, take care.

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:39.020
If you didn't understand that, well, it's basically access to Mexico,

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.020
your favorite neighborhood Mexican, and I want to

01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:47.020
congratulate Orange Mouse Radio for their 300th episode, so

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:51.020
congrats, and keep up the good fight.

01:32:51.020 --> 01:33:03.020
So, basically that, congratulations.

01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:09.020
300! 300! 300! 300!

01:33:09.020 --> 01:33:13.020
Excuse me, is it Rob? Hey, it's Misty.

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.020
What? You know I was going to call you.

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:21.020
Congrats on episode 300. You know, I heart you.

01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:25.020
I'll heart you guys forever. Bye.

01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:29.020
Hey, Orange is on Under Radio, it's CJ Tyrant. Just wanted to say congrats on

01:33:29.020 --> 01:33:33.020
300 episodes. That's amazing. Shout out to all the Be My Hands

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:37.020
out there in the chat room. You guys rock. Keep playing Be My Games.

01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:41.020
Keep playing music games, though, too. And congrats to Rob from Game of Ph.D.

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.020
Off the hat, you. Anyways, congratulations.

01:33:45.020 --> 01:33:49.020
300 episodes so far, looking forward to the next 300.

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:53.020
Have a good week, guys.

01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:57.020
I'd like to wish you guys a good 300th episode

01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.020
of OLR, so I will not be listening live tonight.

01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:05.020
I'm going to set out to actually play DDR in a few minutes, so I will

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:09.020
try for today for a special AAA for you guys, so

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:13.020
hopefully we look into a couple hundred more OLR episodes

01:34:13.020 --> 01:34:17.020
in the next couple of years before. And I'm going to be heading out, so peace out.

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:21.020
And AAA for these jammer games. Hey guys, if you're listening to your listeners,

01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:25.020
CJ Tyrant, and I'm calling to tell you that Orange is on Under Radio is the A show

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:29.020
when it comes to gaming projects. And I really don't understand how much this show does mean to us

01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:33.020
fans. 300 episodes, guys. Congratulations. Looking forward to more

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:43.020
A show in 2009.

01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:47.020
Hey. Hey. What?

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:51.020
Did you like, um, did you upload

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:55.020
the thing yet? I'm working on it right now, but before I get to

01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:59.020
upload it, there's one thing we gotta do first. What? We have to

01:34:59.020 --> 01:35:03.020
wish Orange is On's radio a happy 300. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely.

01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:07.020
So let's get it going. I'm DJ Ronn S. And I'm Kudo Osagie.

01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:07.020
And on behalf of the staff at Anime Jam

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:15.020
which is me, Kudo, and Sailor Flair, we want to congratulate Rob,

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:19.020
Jamie, and Loke, on an awesome 300 episode tonight.

01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:23.020
Oh my gosh, 300 episodes. What are you guys going to do now? Like go to Disney World?

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:27.020
I hope not. They've already done Disney World. I know, it's so

01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:33.020
I know but um tonight, I'm gonna I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna have a drink based on each one of them

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:39.000
So these are awesome funds tonight. You're gonna like totally plastered. I feel bad for you. I'm not gonna be fast

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.780
Hey, what instead of arguing won't you come into the chat room tonight?

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:52.060
Oh, it'll be fun

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:58.960
So, um, Rob Matt Jamie have a great show tonight and you know, I'll be there and see you for episode real one

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:02.160
Hey, so we're excited

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.760
Just a little bit

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:32.080
All right, awesome. Have a good show tonight. See you laters

01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.020
Welcome back everybody to episode number 300 of orange lounge radio in this Sunday evening, October the 26th

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.400
2008 just a reminder. There will be no show next week

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.980
I'm just due to the fact that hey

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:49.480
We deserve a week off after 300 episodes and the fact that I'm having surgery and I'm being held up by Loki

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:56.080
Dressed as sack boy, which you can see on our Justin TV feed at Justin TV slash orange lounge radio

01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:03.040
Right now he's holding up tipped gunny. Oh, he's holding up the Justin listeners with a gun. That's that's lovely. Where'd you get a gun?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.640
Okay, I'm like where the hell who got you a gun Rob I have airsoft guns, all right

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.320
Pistols, all right

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.560
Anyhow, I know we want to get to the skype line. We got a lot of people want to call in tonight

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:22.200
We're gonna try as many calls as possible

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:26.920
But first we got a little more news to get to and Loki you ready and situated there ready to get us back into some

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.000
Gaming news. Yeah, of course. All righty. All right, so

01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:38.800
Starting things off as I kind of hinted to earlier pin aircade adventures episode 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PC

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:40.880
on

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.720
October 29th

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.960
That's awesome news. No word on ps3 yet

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:51.200
Probably just because they just finally got the first episode so give it a little bit more time

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.800
but it will be $15 on both platforms and

01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.360
Will be all sorts of awesome. So sweet. It better be based on that recommendation

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:06.040
Well, it's supposed to be the first one was kind of fun. So we don't see why the second one would be as well

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.080
Well one thing you might not be getting to do when you play this game online

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:15.360
Even though you don't really play this game online, but other Xbox Live games would be you probably won't get to swear much longer

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:22.880
Apparently the US patent office has granted a patent to Microsoft for real-time censoring of audio streams

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.240
So, you know, this is pretty self-explanatory

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.480
Probably what Microsoft wants as far as they want to be able to censor what Xbox Live is probably most known for

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:38.080
Is the fuck fuck fuck fuck, you know and all that stuff that you hear when you go on Xbox Live, by the way

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:40.080
They can't censor this show. Haha

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.080
Fuck fuck fuck fuck

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.080
You know what though

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:50.680
You know what a writer on Ars Technica though Jonathan Gitlin though

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:55.720
Brings up a really kind of scary point think about this because you know, this is the technology, right?

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.120
I can also envisage a much sinister role

01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:05.400
However, imagine the same system applied to digital telephony then think how valuable such a system might be to an authoritarian

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.320
authoritarian regime

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:10.840
As we've seen to good effect in Burma and elsewhere the ubiquity of cell phones

01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:13.840
It's been a good thing for dissidents who need to get their message out or organize themselves

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:18.520
The Great Firewall of China already blocks objectionable web content from reaching Chinese computers

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:24.320
What's to stop cell phones from censoring anti-government conversations, too? That is kind of a scary thought

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:27.440
Let's hope that this isn't used for you know, anything

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.400
Pushing the limits I can imagine this is

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.800
Gonna be a scary thing if it falls into the wrong hands. So Janai brings up an interesting point

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.960
What's that in chat? Imagine censoring the angry video game nerd?

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.960
Well, yeah still just anything it's a it kind of threatens free speech. His powers are beyond Microsoft's comprehension

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:50.960
If indeed if in the wrong hands, I you know again in this country, you know, since free speech is in our Constitution

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:53.920
I don't think it's gonna be a big problem. But you know, it could be interesting to see the effect

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.800
This could have another place. I think the guy makes a good point

01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:00.360
What if it falls in the wrong hands, but also I can't imagine that this is going to be

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:06.120
That accurate, you know what I mean? That'd be ways. Will it catch me if I say frack?

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:13.280
The thing is with what if I'm talking about my shih tzu dog, am I gonna get censored thing is Rob about free speech rights

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.400
Yeah, the government can't inhibit your free speech rights

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:24.120
But companies sure can when you agree to play by their rules exactly as long as you've signed the agreement saying that you're going to use

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:25.840
their

01:40:25.840 --> 01:40:27.840
proprietary, you know

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.120
Software and I guess the hardware to since it's referring to the Xbox

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:36.640
Then they do have a right to censor any content that comes through their own

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.240
equipment it's just like a

01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.120
private

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:47.680
Organization denying people the use of their facilities exactly. All right, I get that I get that but still I'm gonna be very disappointed

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:50.180
Since I pay for Microsoft service if I can't say fuck

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.560
However, knowing Microsoft and based on track history only I'm going to assume it'll probably be a switch little

01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:59.520
You know help keep it safe for kids, which I'm cool with, you know

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.800
If parents want to turn it on but they shouldn't rely on it. That's the other dangerous thing

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.640
I don't want parents to rely on it to see it like, you know, some of those TBS

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320
comedies where they replace it with like

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.760
Stupid words just like ordinary thing like what a fruit

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.760
French toast

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.180
Shove it up your bologna. Yes, like

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:28.380
Well or kazoo or be perfectly honest the whole reason that swear words are considered swear words in the beginning is

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:32.820
Because people have given them the power to offend and what is it that I have been saying?

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:37.060
For a very long time now you find this show very offensive

01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:42.000
Oh, whatever learn to be offended the less of a big deal you make out of it

01:41:42.780 --> 01:41:44.780
The less it's gonna matter. I mean really

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:50.660
The whole reason that I think you know little kids think it's fun to go out and cuss from their little kids is because their

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:55.820
Parents say oh, that's bad. You shouldn't do it the less you're allowed to do something the more y'all want to do it

01:41:56.620 --> 01:42:00.500
Exactly it people do that because people do that because it raises eyebrows

01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.740
Well, look folks

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:08.860
No one gets offended. Why would they want to do it anymore? I would love to see Microsoft's and giggles

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:27.180
Well, that's why I would love to see Microsoft just try and censor this next segment of ours

01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.180
The FUs of the week

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:34.160
Fuck you with something hard and sandpaper II

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:47.360
to a certain closed-minded tight-assed bigoted conservatives that have been

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:55.440
Less than polite in regards to how they decide to phrase their personal points of view and

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:02.320
F you to other things that are personal. All right

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:06.760
Oh go and F you to my hair

01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:11.400
Loki F you the sack boy for being so fluffy cuz

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:18.000
Fluffy equals hot you're kind of you're kind of fluffy Loki. I am couple that's why I didn't have to pad the front

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.040
Yeah, no needing the pad myself. Well that and it's really friggin hot

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:28.120
But actually luckily the sweatshirt is quite thin so it's not too bad

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:33.440
I actually have like jeans under the pants and another t-shirt under this shirt

01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.840
so

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.800
All right, but the heads really fucking hot can't can't do anything with the head my turn

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.180
Yes, yay. I want to say F you to the people that decided to call me faggot yesterday

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:49.680
Well, I was out protesting prop 8 we were out there on the streets holding signs

01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.060
You know, I had a big thing said, you know protect civil rights and all stuff

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:59.680
there was a group of us out there and some guy as he drove by decided to yell faggots and throw candy corn at us cuz

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.680
That's that's the world. We live in folks. No, I don't know whether to be angry or happy that no

01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.600
It's like it's like and one hand I'm offended by what you said in the other hand candy corn

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.120
Not when they've fallen on the dirty-ass Street. I'm not oh, that's just not except that is I guess

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:20.540
So not only did he say faggot Loki. He wasted candy corn and if you don't know

01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.300
You don't waste time. I'm sorry

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:29.660
Is is it wrong for me to mention that we're supposed to learn to stop throwing things and having food fight

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.660
Yeah, when we're in kindergarten

01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:36.820
Yeah, and then oh, yeah, and then the lady as she was coming out of the drive-thru

01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:41.020
No, here's the best one the lady coming out the drive-thru faggots. You're all going to hell

01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:45.580
That's what she yelled at us. They should have thrown skittles. No, you know what I said, I yelled back

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:51.580
I said God loves a bigot too. That's what I said back to her. Then she drove off pissed off good. So

01:44:52.540 --> 01:44:56.580
You know and so don't sit there and tell me this proposition isn't about hate and discrimination

01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.940
Cuz I'll tell you what I've seen it right in the face and it is so yeah. All right

01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:05.060
Moving on some real quick F use from our guests because we have a lot in studio

01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:08.300
We'll start with Drew since he has a mic. All right F you to my student government for

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:13.900
being assholes about the whole proposition thing agreed, I didn't vote him in and

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:20.940
They're trying to speak for the entire student body and I don't like it one bit actually I did to go with this

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:25.900
I might have mentioned this earlier. There was a girl who was driving in front of me leaving school

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:33.380
We forget the same school and she wrote on her car. No to prop eight. The ARC Student Council does not represent me. I

01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.860
approve of that

01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:37.060
but

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:44.300
Also F you to people who are taking the zombie event in while a little too far and taking the hordes and hordes of zombies

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:51.180
People taking Wow too far to the low B zones and killing all the low B's are trying to start out

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:59.500
That's not cool. I mean, yeah, it's zombies and it's brains, but it's not cool. Don't be a dick

01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:03.480
All right, pick up boy. Do you have any F use of the week?

01:46:03.480 --> 01:46:06.800
I'm gonna send a nephew toward

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.960
the bimbo of politicians everywhere and I don't even think I need to you know,

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:16.560
Go any further with that because everybody should know who I'm talking about

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.480
But so I shall pass the mic on

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.560
Arcadian 42 fuck you to 65-hour work weeks. They suck

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.600
put me behind like

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:31.840
Way way behind on everything. But oh well give me money

01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:39.120
Good money is good. Doctor. Fuck you to expert on DDR because I look like a douche trying to do it nice

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.100
And lastly Mel Chan anything you want to say free no fuck use for Mel Chan. All right

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:54.600
All right, that's it for the F use of the week dark Sakura take us back to some gaming news and stuff happened the end

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.360
Okay, it'd be soft

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:01.720
as actually working on the latest I know game and

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:06.160
Actually have had to push it back a little bit

01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:12.320
As well as one that they have literally called an as yet unannounced

01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:17.280
Franchise they were gonna release it to the 2008-2009

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:24.520
Fiscal year, but it's actually going to be oh nine ten. We don't know what this is. But I know I'm 1404 is

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:26.960
a

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.880
settlement building game

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:30.880
This speaks for itself

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:34.960
There's there's a trailer around if someone wants to look at game trailers. I'm sure there's one there

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:41.360
But the other one they're not saying what it is, but they said that it's an unannounced one. So

01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.280
Maybe it's a brand new franchise

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.920
could be

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.160
Hmm

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:49.920
well

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:55.720
Something unfortunately hasn't been delayed is an update to the Wii firmware. That's now

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.120
disabling the homebrew channel from being installed

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.720
other possible

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:04.040
problems faced with that are some

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.840
homebrew programs not running also

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:09.680
the

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:16.240
video player that they had that also allowed you to watch DVDs is not working as well the end player and

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.280
Right now though if you do have the homebrew channel installed you're fine, but you won't be able to install it if you

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.280
You know do

01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:27.800
3.3 also in Japan

01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:35.840
They have the shop channel down right now for maintenance as they're changing all the references to Wii points to Nintendo points and other

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.760
Pre-dsi maintenance is that a little deceiving though because the points aren't going to be interchangeable that strikes me as kind of dumb it is

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.240
deceiving yes

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960
And then also apparently right now

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:53.360
If you don't update your system you will not be able to access the shop channel

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:58.480
Which is ironic because if you think about it if they're not able to access the shop channel

01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:01.000
They won't buy your crap that you're selling online

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.480
And you know with the homebrew stuff that it is easy to I don't know

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:08.760
Pirate said games that you're offering on the service

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:14.000
I would think that you would want to allow people to be able to purchase your games and let them have fun with the homebrew

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.800
stuff since

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.600
likely

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:24.800
Situation is is that they're actually not pirating games using that they're just you know playing with these home brew people

01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.280
jobs I

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:31.080
Don't think they need jobs. It's just if there's something offered to them for free

01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:35.840
They're gonna take the free route then rather than pay for a game that might be crap and unfortunately

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:38.160
There's a lot of might be crap games on the Wii

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:44.800
Um kloutipo in chat says so do the people who have to try and close all these homebrew exploits

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:50.080
Just completely and utterly hate their jobs. I see so no way someone could take pleasure from that well

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:56.720
I I can see the other side though. You know people stealing other people's work by pirating such games

01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:02.240
Don't lie. This is what a lot of the quote-unquote homebrew people do I can see both sides of it, though?

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:08.560
All right well um I guess maybe I should hurry up and install that before my Wii updates itself because I haven't updated it yet

01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:10.240
So maybe I should get that homebrew channel on there

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:15.320
I don't know is it is it gonna screw me over later if I put it on there now no you can always delete it

01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:20.200
It's not like you're gonna buy anything on the Wii shop channel Rob. Well. I don't know this this might do the trick

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:26.440
It's something new that was announced this week. It's Mart racer. Do you remember the old-school game show supermarket sweep?

01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:31.640
Dude, that's this the greatest ever that's this look. There's a little trailer here. We're playing in studio

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:35.400
It's yeah

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:41.400
Lifetime lawnmowers unpacked, but look at this you actually run around a supermarket with your cart

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:47.000
And you but you pick up plungers for some weird reason, but if you run into other shoppers

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.000
But yeah like it's everything you've always wanted to do in the supermarket

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.760
They're all kind of crazy out of eight characters, so there you have it. It's like it's gonna rock suit meets

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:04.040
Jet-set radio or something like that by the way according to Juan grill who is the studio manager for the developers Joju games?

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:07.160
He says that Mart racer was inspired from the shape of the wiimote

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:10.080
He says quote the first time I grabbed a wiimote instinctively

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.720
I grabbed it with both hands like a bar that made me start thinking on a game where you can maneuver it like you would

01:51:14.720 --> 01:50:52.000
Be grabbing a

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:20.480
So that is how we came to the game as a Mat

01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:23.720
would be grabbing a bar so there you go and if you want to play with a classic

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:27.460
controller you can but I guess it's probably more fun with motion controls

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:30.860
because you can imagine that you're pushing that cart just like a bat out of

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:35.700
hell up and down the aisles of Safeway it'll be lots of fun you know I wonder

01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:39.340
because people are always afraid about you know real life taking after video

01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:42.920
games I wonder if this is gonna cause an epidemic of like you know people running

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:47.300
around supermarkets like crazy let's go on a milkshake run as if this milkshake

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:51.260
as if this game get more stuff for milkshakes as if this game will sell that

01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:54.640
many copies although I don't know it sounds pretty awesome to me I might

01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:58.000
actually I might break my protest just for Mart racer because it looks that

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.440
awesome anyhow what are some other things you can download our sagra well

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:11.480
there is a few games coming out on we were in the UK there are there's the

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:18.240
incredible maze which is a 500 we points and it's different it's mazes and has

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:23.320
balance board support so you actually steer a ball around the maze and dodge

01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:26.960
traps basically it's marble madness with the balance board from what I understand

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:32.240
there's also interior design and well an interior design game sorry called home

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:41.200
sweet home that is you basically take rooms and redesign them sort of like a

01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:46.200
bizarre puzzle and it's a thousand we points and then there's Tetris party

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:52.280
which is 1200 we points that is minigame Tetris using the balance board and it

01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:57.200
has online multiplayer for up to six people yeah but how many times have I

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:06.760
played Tetris really what just remember the epic battle with Christopher thank

01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:11.840
you kept yelling at us again for Tetris on the DS Oh God he was a scary

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:16.640
motherfucker on Tetris on the DS I remember that that was some scary stuff

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:26.080
yeah thanks for the memories alright anyhow I'm sorry yes so other than stuff

01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:30.720
coming on to the WiiWare service there's some interesting stuff if you happen to

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:38.440
own a Super Nintendo system apparently a German programmer took upon himself to

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:43.960
create a new console game that supports eight players his creation is a brawler

01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:50.960
called n warp die sukent or it looks like a yeah die sakusen and allows you

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:57.600
to plug in two multi taps in the one and our SNES and yeah it's pretty awesome

01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:02.640
but you can also if you don't want to I don't know say find a cart for it since

01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:05.440
it doesn't look like there is an actual cart you can play it through an emulator

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:13.320
but I don't know that's pretty awesome eight player brawler game for Super

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:17.600
Nintendo if you want to download it the website is gra dot d force three

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:25.200
thousand dot de so that's where you can get that wonderful game all right well

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.240
for those of you looking forward to new Nintendo products Animal Crossing city

01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.920

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:01.920
already gotten most of the games I'm looking forward to I guess the only

02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:05.800
thing I've left is resistance to resistance to is a good one now do you

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:12.560
have anyone you're looking for do anyone else left for dead yeah I want zombie

02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:21.160
action to speak into the microphone which one wait what I miss last remnant

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:24.000
what game are you looking forward to that hasn't come out yet that you don't

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:30.960
already have a little big planet yeah fallout 3 hopefully this week yeah I

02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:33.560
want to play a lot of little big planet while I'm recovering from surgery that's

02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:41.200
the plan it'll be fun to play while you're on drugs yes that's I'm sorry

02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:44.920
I'm also looking forward to last remnant though even though I was not a fan of

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:49.760
infinite undiscovery I thought that I thought that it does the beginning was

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:54.080
awful like it didn't want me I didn't want to play it past the first hour in

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:58.400
comparison to blue dragon even blue dragon I played for at least like the

02:06:58.400 --> 02:07:03.920
first disc but the best was lost Odyssey by waste of time I swear lost us he was

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:07.640
the best by far that's that's it for email though all right mailbag orange

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:11.920
launch radio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week meanwhile

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:20.800
more news Loki yes anyways so of course we know about the new game coming out

02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:27.520
halo recon or halo 3 recon apparently though bungees halo team is moving on to

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:34.560
other things once this is done so I don't know maybe another game from bungee

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:43.040
that's say not halo maybe a I don't know marathon game something like that a low

02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:50.840
may low marathon oh haven't they said this before like oh we swear we're not

02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:55.520
doing this before like after halo 3 but you know it says basically they were

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:59.680
saying that they want to work on different territory and they said but I

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.160
think when this project wraps up in a couple months that it will be time for

02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:09.200
when the team moves on to something else and part of the team will move on

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.800
something else and part of them will probably be absorbed into one of the

02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:15.880
other projects that are already on the way I like what a deep man suggests in

02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:26.080
the chat room a game called j-lo get it tips it say you know we need forget it

02:08:26.080 --> 02:08:30.840
hey you know how the PlayStation 3 has trophies well according to the u.s.

02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:34.560
official PlayStation magazine Sony might actually be giving out more than just

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.240
trophies pretty soon it's a little quote from the magazine that people were

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:41.240
reading way too much into it says quote we've heard that SCA is mulling over

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.080
some sort of trophy reward system we doubt it'll be cash to the equivalent

02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:48.720
but we suspect it might be exclusive access to early betas and the like so

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:53.280
you know trophies are like PlayStation 3's version of 360s achievements

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:57.400
wouldn't that be interesting if suddenly you could use your trophies to now get

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:01.000
into betas and stuff I think Microsoft should do the same thing because I play

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.040
a lot more Microsoft games and well you know and and I agree with the people that

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:10.840
wrote this story on the net I got no problem if it's early demos or what have

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.120
you but just to give exclusive that seems kind of wrong to me just

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:18.480
encourages people to do nothing but play games all day but then again this whole

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:22.440
thing whole world is something retarded what is your what here's the words doing

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:26.320
you know where for example if you have different achievements and Gears of War

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:31.280
that you get shit for Gears of War 2 could it be something like that that

02:09:31.280 --> 02:09:34.720
makes you know I beat you know a little big planet when little big planet 2

02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:40.320
comes out or something like that I get some stupid costume or something that

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.600
works that works yeah all right well we'll see what happens maybe more to

02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:54.880
come from Sony probably in 2009 I doubt that Sony's gonna explode the end it

02:09:54.880 --> 02:09:58.600
already exploded it puked out something called Star Wars galaxies black wolf

02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:02.000
has a good point I got to read this in chat okay sky what's better giving

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.560
exclusive betas to people who have lots of trophies or giving exclusive betas to

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:10.720
people who buy core I'll take option three giving exclusive betas to me here

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:16.200
that's the best of me anyway in other words the fanboys will never be happy

02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:27.400
well there is a a boy named Brandon crisp 50 15 years old who went missing

02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:35.560
after his parents confiscated his Xbox there is a Microsoft Canada is adding

02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:42.000
$25,000 to the reward information that will you know hopefully lead to his safe

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:45.480
return so they're basically doubling the amount that's already out they're

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:52.440
working with the Barrie Ontario authorities looking for IP addresses of

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:56.360
anyone who had come into contact with him through Call of Duty 4 which was his

02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:04.160
favorite game and Microsoft is really really putting forward a lot of effort

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:14.280
into trying to get this kid back so basically the oh god I hate this person

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:20.960
how is it Microsoft's problem he who shall not be named has involved himself

02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:30.920
what the fuck I thought he was gone let me finish making an offer to the to help

02:11:30.920 --> 02:11:36.040
the cops try to find it and and making up some crap about a video game

02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.760

it the people that are supposed to threaten to move to Canada are the

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:56.280
Liberals that are afraid that you know it's like push gets reelected just I

02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:59.960

can't even call him a human being anymore really it's he's just a part

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:18.080
I think he's a part at any rate for anyone who might have some information

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:24.200
on his whereabouts call the Berry police at seven oh five seven two five seven

02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:32.760

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.160

punished for it and asshole hasn't learned his lesson yet I mean seriously

02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:12.480
the only thing that's gonna stop this guy is to lock him up in a padded room

your mind I got around to playing the new Castlevania this week which I'm

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:19.000
surprised he didn't mention on last week's release dates did oh did you know

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:23.280
didn't we get mentioned at the end here we did I think we did keep the podcast

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:26.480
is a little behind so make sure you have the most current episode oh I don't

02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:31.080
walk us I'm not down in the podcast oh well you I think it got mentioned but

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:36.080
anyway okay so I haven't played it yet I want to what do you think of the game

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:41.920
it's it's like the other DS Castlevania is more or less well I like those like

02:16:41.920 --> 02:16:48.880
how they have like a lot of new areas now it's like one big area how does it

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:53.200
compare to previous Castlevania games like well like the maps for example

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.240
they're smaller now but there's like there's like more enemies so it's more

02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:01.440
difficult and like you'll usually be so busy funny anyways that you'll hardly

02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:05.160
notice that the amount of small especially cuz like for this game I

02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:09.920
don't use I hardly use the map like I usually have the second screen for like

02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:17.840
checking enemies and stuff hmm do we have any really bad beat movie dialogue

02:17:17.840 --> 02:17:23.720
in the game um yeah the English voice acting kind of sucks and there's a

02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:28.360
Japanese language option but for me doesn't make it any better always make

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:35.000
it into a language that I'm not very fluent in yet hmm all right well do you

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:40.400
recommend it to fans of Castlevania yeah I've been that doesn't sound like a very

02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:47.880
solid yes kind of like a yeah I guess I mean you have nothing better to do I

02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:52.160
guess you could do it and if it if you're looking for a game that's like

02:17:52.160 --> 02:17:57.040
more action oriented and like exploration oriented and this is a

02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:03.160

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:40.840
radio who's this hello there orange lounge this is a character hello my

02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:48.240
friend how are you I'm doing just fine I'm well what I call well I was quite

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:56.960
surprised that at last the downloadable pack this week for rock band in in the

02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:02.520
sense that it was a few sushi and banshee songs we're really the we're

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:08.760
really like my we my best best news of the week actually yes I know I'm very

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:13.040
excited about that just it's nice to see a nice eclectic mix of music and rock

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:21.960
band my problem is though that that all of the three songs that are there that

02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:29.160
are there only one of them is good actually yeah they are to be picky

02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:32.600
there's no peek-a-boo or anything which would be rad but I can't imagine

02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:36.840
actually playing that song in rock band that's the thing yeah well babe but that

02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:40.840
and that you mentioning peek-a-boo is like in one way if you know if you know

02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:45.400
the history behind that song you know that it will be quite hard in one way

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:53.320
since the whole song is played backwards so it's right since they have to learn

02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:57.880
how to play it all back what would be a fun challenge mode though there's notes

02:22:57.880 --> 02:23:04.600
can scroll the opposite way well it'll be fun yeah what else is going on your

02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:12.760
gaming world this week not much actually not much at all I'm it's a bit it's

02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:17.920
really a sad thing in one way since well I bought Warhammer online so when it

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:25.040
came out and well I have it I have played it like the number of times I

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:29.560
have actually played it I can count it on one hand Wow me too I'm in the exact

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:34.360
same boat you are and and then and then I started thinking in one way actually

02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:41.720
since since I was it was a I check actually I didn't check out Wow went

02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:50.560
back to Wow actually but I did see the new logins frequents the login login

02:23:50.560 --> 02:24:01.560
screen and that actually made me go we who big frost worm yeah it's got

02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:05.960
mushroomed well we just had a flying mushroom behave boys and girls in studio

02:24:05.960 --> 02:24:15.200

distracted here people are throwing things each other's studio yes go ahead

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:25.760
well other than that well I'm sorry I'm starting to get sort of in one way

02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:31.100
pissed also since at the current state I have no TV whatsoever oh my god which

02:24:31.100 --> 02:24:38.200

well the other week I went to Tokyo game show which was really exciting tell us

02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:07.800
about that how was Tokyo game show what kind of stuff did you see there oh it

02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:13.760
was huge very exciting tons of people the biggest booth is probably Xbox 360

02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:20.240
do you think Xbox 360 is going to turn around in Japan I believe so I mean they

02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.520
had a pretty big booth and tons of people waiting in line they had 105

02:27:25.520 --> 02:27:33.640
minute wait for one game Wow what game was that I think it was the last remnant

02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:37.760
mmm I'm kind of not surprised at that yeah because that would be the game that

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:43.160
is supposed to like kind of cater to the Japanese audience wow that's why e3

02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:48.040
can't go public you guys 105 minute waits just to play like one RPG imagine

02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:50.800
what those Wii U lines would have looked like if it was open to the public of the

02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:58.400
nut so anyway Wow well I'm glad I'm glad you're having a good time

02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:03.760
I want to talk about called time hollow okay and it is a Japanese game but it

02:28:03.760 --> 02:28:07.840
was just released in the States and it is amazing if you ever heard of shadow

02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:13.000
of destiny's for the PlayStation 1 it's much like that game in which you have to

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.080
change the past and then it causes something else to change which you got

02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:21.880
to go back and change again and it has real anime videos throughout the whole

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:26.440
game I loved it so it sounds kind of like a puzzle game but with anime

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:34.920
cutscenes not a puzzle game it's an adventure game interesting oh Mel chance

02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:41.920
Mel chance calling it butterfly effect the game yes okay that's kind of cool

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:45.520
okay all right I might have to check that out you know there's a lot of these

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:49.400
games that really don't show up on the radar like that that I wish would get

02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:53.520
more coverage so I know to look out for them yeah I was drooling over it for a

02:28:53.520 --> 02:28:58.200

02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:47.880
feel like I know it's really not worth it I know I know I have not downloaded

02:30:47.880 --> 02:30:51.160
beaten groovy if you play that game you're just encouraging them make crap

02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:55.320
I know I know same with beaten groovy it's like seriously what have they I

02:30:55.320 --> 02:31:03.360
mean what was so what the fuck it does have a couple good songs in it but it

02:31:03.360 --> 02:31:09.160
the price tag sucks the price tag sucks it only has a couple songs in it all

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:14.000
right gs68 says is it even worse than worse than Yaris I would actually say

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:17.640
no beaten groovy at least has star mine and shit it's not worse than yours but

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:24.500
it's better than crisis shut up all right any games coming out for 360 that

always let us call into your show but we're never you're never on ours what's

02:32:57.320 --> 02:33:01.400
on your mind Bobby well no I was just coming it calling in to congratulate you

02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:05.480
on 300 and you know kind of a question for you guys about your show well thank

02:33:05.480 --> 02:33:12.360
you where do you see you yourself at episode 400 canceled no I somebody had

02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:17.000
to say it where do we see ourselves at episode 400 um good question I'll let

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:24.920
Loki start probably not much different than it is now I mean as the show

02:33:24.920 --> 02:33:28.120
fundamentally changed that much as one well I guess in a way yes it has only

02:33:28.120 --> 02:33:31.920
talking like two years I mean seriously I mean it's since episode one we did

02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:37.580
change from a you know show about DDR that was very random sometimes I mean my

02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:42.840
god we're talking about the next systems I think honestly in two years it'll be

02:33:42.840 --> 02:33:46.880
kind of about the next round of systems I think we'll try to do our best to

02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:51.440
maintain to stay on the cutting edge of interactive tools I think you will see

02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:55.560
Orange Launch Radio getting into video more in two years not necessarily that

02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:59.960
we're gonna be hell we will not in the way you think like not necessarily it'll

02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:04.920
be our mugs reading the news like it'll be fairies but maybe kind of the shut up

02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:10.800
maybe the way like folks interact with us I think will be different I I just

02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:14.220
you know cuz you know we were one of the first shows to really jump on skype when

02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:18.240
that first came out and you know just in TV we weren't really the first but you

02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:21.800
know that was a way to kind of expand through that and you know we like to try

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.000
to stay on the cutting edge of how to stay interactive with the listeners so

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:29.160
you know I it's it's hard to think of what hasn't been done yet

02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:36.320
I don't know does that Sackboy costume have like fur on it does that gun is a

02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:40.320
furry for you no it's not it's I don't know what is it's stuff it's like

02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:44.320
sweatshirt material it's like a giant sweatshirt is what it is it's not furry

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:50.120
though so and no tingle hat on it no table at this time but we figured this

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:52.780
is the closest the listeners are ever gonna get to seeing Loki in a tingle

02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:58.240
outfit so you gotta you gotta take take what you can no because from what I can

02:34:58.240 --> 02:35:03.000
understand Loki likes Sackboy so it's not as fun to see him dressed up as that

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:07.420
is it would be to see him dressed up as tingle but it's still adorable well I

02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:11.440
can't help it someone hasn't sold another 800,000 copies of something you

02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:15.220
know we're working on it well we're friends forever we're putting

02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:19.960
billboards up for it so and we're given I'm sorry I have I have a PlayStation

02:35:19.960 --> 02:35:23.800
3 now so I can add Loki to my friends list so you don't have to be Loki's only

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:28.000
friend anymore but I have more than one friend now you know yeah he dumped me as

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:31.200
his only friend oh there are some other people that actually had a little bit

02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:33.640
planned already they were playing it not that I could play at them because the

02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:37.000
servers aren't up yet till tomorrow they're gonna be up tomorrow fuck yeah

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:44.520
so yeah can't wait so hey Bobby now that you're on the r-rated show is there

02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:47.320
anything you want to say about guitar hero world tour you didn't get to say

02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:53.080
on your show well I see yeah when you added that I didn't get to say on my

02:35:53.080 --> 02:36:00.560
show that kind of cut it out oh yeah the drums fucking suck and maybe next time

02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:05.440
Activision really should kind of look at their own equipment before they badmouth

02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:09.880
the other ones and say hey when dearest breaks you can come by ours cuz it won't

02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:15.400
break yeah I got I got a break because it's already broken have you thought

02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:21.120
about checking out rock revolutions drum set just to see if it's better well I

02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:24.840
don't think it's out yet actually oh my gosh even though the game's out the game

02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:28.640
is out the drum sets not out until November because apparently they haven't

02:36:28.640 --> 02:36:33.940
quite figured out the manufacturing of that either and I've played on the drum

02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:40.360
kit and a couple times but no the actual drum sets not in stores yet it's just

02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.400
the game what I want to know is the drums weren't I mean I don't think I

02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:48.200
didn't get to play it but it didn't seem that the drums were broken when they

02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:53.360
were showing it off what happened I mean seriously mass production I guess yeah

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:59.880
you know when they're take you know taking stuff like that to a convention

02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:05.280
they a test it and make sure they only bring the units that work and you know

02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:09.360
B when a unit breaks they have a replacement or they just closed down

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:12.760
that station I remember when rock band was first shown at the packs that you

02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:17.080
guys weren't at the year before they started out with like three drum sets

02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:21.600
and they had one by the end of the year by the end of the weekend and you could

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:25.200
actually see the other drum sets all like bandaged up in the corner of the

02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:32.280
booth it was the sad depressed broken machines and I had Dan Teasdale on on I

02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:36.000
was doing an interview with him for my show from the booth and I asked him

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:39.160
about you know the durability of the drum sets and while I was asking the

02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:42.600
question I looked at the pile of depressed drum sets and he didn't take

02:37:42.600 --> 02:37:46.880
the bait interesting well it is amazing how those guys talk sometimes they

02:37:46.880 --> 02:37:50.960
surprised another review so far of said anything about the drum sets breaking I

02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:54.440
don't mean there is a thread on Kotaku and stuff that they're talking about

02:37:54.440 --> 02:37:57.640
like a game facts forum thread or something like that that people were

02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:01.760
saying hey you know we're posted for your drum sets work or not and there's

02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:05.160
people having problems with guitars having problems with the drum sets I

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:10.500
mean just a lot of them I have not seen a single post from anybody that says my

02:38:10.500 --> 02:38:15.840
drums work perfectly that's not to say that there's none that aren't effective

02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:20.800
but I just either they're too busy playing the game or they just don't post

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:28.400
on forums or whatever everybody has some sort of problem with the drums Wow well

02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:32.920
I mean yeah I guess it's a good thing I don't buy these games for the drum parts

02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:36.000
because I'm just not good at drum so I always buy them for guitars but still

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.280
you know if I ever was interested in doing it someday that's kind of

02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:43.920
depressing I don't know yeah and I mean I guess now I've got to do the whole RMA

02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:48.320
process but I'm kind of worried you know have they fixed it yet because some of

02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:51.040
these threads you know I've looked on the official guitar hero forums which I

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:55.180
know are mostly negative because the people only post there when they're

02:38:55.180 --> 02:39:00.520
pissed or can't play true but they've said you know one guy said I've returned

02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:05.360
it three times my store has no more every single drum set that I've gotten

02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:10.200
from the store has a different pad that's broken dang like they can't get

02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:14.320
one that has all five pads that work maybe they rushed it maybe they just

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:17.200
rushed it I think that's really what it is they just didn't take the time to get

02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:20.680
it right and you want to know what's funny is if you go to Activision's now

02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:24.440
this is something I didn't say on my show if you go to Activision's support

02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:29.120
site and you look at the question you know why are my pads not working one of

02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:34.160
the things that actually says is you may need to hit it harder or softer these

02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:40.640
drums react differently than other drum games you may have played so they kind

02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:44.520
of insinuate that it's harmonics is fault that you're trying to play guitar

02:39:44.520 --> 02:39:52.120
hero in a specific way in a way that works huh because it's weird because

02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:57.680
ordinary drums they just seem to make noise whenever I hit them yeah you know

02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:01.080
Bobby and it's just it's kind of funny coming from you because I know you're

02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.480
essentially a professional drummer and you know it's just kind of funny that

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:10.520
she a professional drummer isn't playing the drums right apparently yeah and I

02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:14.360
mean it's you have to smack it really hard for it to register and they say

02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:18.360
well you may need to hit a pad harder or you may need to hit them softer and I'm

02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:24.040
like not in that sense you shouldn't have to hit the right pad three times as

02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:29.280
hard as the middle pad and stuff and I mean I I even plugged in my professional

02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:33.920
drum kit which I've been passing around photos and oh man that little bit of

02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:37.360
problem on you have to post that photo in chat because it's hilarious seeing

02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:41.080
all your equipment just like practically on top of each other I want to ask you

02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:44.400
though real quick um what about the guitar with the game because for those

02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:47.280
of us that aren't so much into drums or guitars have you have you played around

02:40:47.280 --> 02:40:50.920
with that at all I play around a little bit with the guitar and I am happy to

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.920
report that my guitar looks like it has absolutely no problem now that being

02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.760
said I don't really understand the point of that slider thing the tutorial shows

02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:05.760
you how to use it and it doesn't work all the time but I think it's because

02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:10.480
I'm doing it wrong not because the hardware sucks but it's kind of like the

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:17.280
lower fret notes in in rock band I'll never use it yeah you know that there's

02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:21.760
things that you can do with it now one of the things is that is your wah wah so

02:41:21.760 --> 02:41:26.440
instead of using the whammy bar for for things that maybe you don't have star

02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:29.600
power you can actually run your hand along that and it does the wah wah thing

02:41:29.600 --> 02:41:32.720
which is kind of cool and I know weird times just for the novelty factor huh

02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:40.120
but the guitar feels fine and they actually did add one of the one of the

02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:43.600
actual software things for people that didn't buy the guitar that they added to

02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:48.360
get world tour is that now you can have like one note held down and then you can

02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:52.200
strum down a second note and a third note so they'll do chords that kind of

02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:56.120
come on like that they're not hammer-ons but you still have to keep one note held

02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.440
down while you bring the second one in interesting huh well I'm still using a

02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:05.800
guitar hero to explore in all my games that's the only controller I have so

02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:11.400
it's time for me to get a new one so be interesting and other than that you

02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:14.520
know people are asking how's the actual game I've been spending most of the day

02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.480
trying to get the game to work so I haven't really gotten too far name

02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:22.000
although I will say that apparently the storyline behind the game according to

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.600
the intro screen is Kenny G comes out and hypnotizes everybody and it's your

02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:32.720
job to un-hypnotize everybody wow that's such a guitar hero story I hope that's

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:37.600
fake I mean cuz that's oh that's the opening cinematic is yet like a guy with

02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:42.080
a clarinet comes out and hypnotizes the entire crowd and so the gh symbol

02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:45.800
flashes on everybody's cell phone and watch and stuff and they all converge

02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:50.160
well un-hypnotize the crowd well aren't they gonna feel stupid when they release

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:56.920
clarinet hero later on all right Bobby we gotta let you go so we can wrap our

02:42:56.920 --> 02:43:03.640

02:43:35.840 --> 02:43:37.800
last Loki do you have any last minute actually

02:43:37.800 --> 02:43:42.400
dark Sakura anything no Loki then I just real quick there was a little big

02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:48.920
planet download that was added into for Japan you know that game ape escape well

02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:54.280
now you can download a costume for your sack boy that's actually the ape in the

02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:59.840
game which is kind of funny also army of two is supposed to be getting a movie as

02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:02.840
well you know it's funny we hear a lot of these movies that are coming out but

02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:06.840
none of them come out except for like math max Payne I guess they're all next

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:12.920
year it's all talk until it actually happens all right so that's it I guess

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:16.600
for last minute stories are at one other quick little dedication here

02:44:16.600 --> 02:44:19.200
drunami wants to do and then we're gonna go around and get final thoughts tonight

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:23.800
a little bit of sad news for the wild players that remember the forums

02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:30.840
remember Ezra Chatterton he was contacted by the make-a-wish foundation

02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:35.360
because he had a brain tumor and talked to Blizzard and had some things

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:41.920
customized for him had a few weapons dedicated to him had an entire tire few

02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:48.640
characters and quest lines in his honor passed away on Monday October 20th from

02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:57.840
a stroke and our thoughts are with them well that's very unfortunate and you

02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.480
know I know there was a lot of people that actually went in and did the will

02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:05.200
you find my dog quest that day just kind of like to because that was his quest

02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:08.520
and his voice is still in the game so it's very interesting that you know

02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:13.040
despite you know what's happened in offline he kind of will continue to

02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:17.560
live on online which is really neat which is something only a video game

02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:23.560
could do so I know that is a very sad note to end episode 300 with so can

02:45:23.560 --> 02:45:29.720

doing another show before Election Day please please please vote and please

02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:20.800

02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:24.760
you'll never have to hear me talk about it again and I also believe you should

02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:29.180
vote no on for hell I'd give you my entire political opinions it's the one

02:47:29.180 --> 02:47:34.760
about parental notification but yeah yeah vote yes for the monorail no one

02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:41.280
damn near everything except the monorail look I honestly land even the

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:44.360
presidential election pales in comparison to what rights are in store

02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:47.280
with prop 8 but that obviously I'm a little biased you can probably

02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:53.520
