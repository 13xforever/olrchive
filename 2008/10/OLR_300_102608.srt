60
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,840
it's just another show nothing special lots of gaming news to talk about tonight but we have to

61
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
start it off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week dark soccer how was

62
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,360
your gaming week um it was a big fable i didn't do much playing in it however dan did and he's

63
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,080
been throwing fire at people and showing off his trophy which i think is entirely and flipping

64
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,120
everyone off which is just the best ever and his guy looks kind of like a gorilla um with a red

65
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,160
coat and it's kind of cool and i've decided that when i play fable um play fable 2 i'm going to

66
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:37,600
make the biggest raging lesbian ever you're still a chicken chaser you chase chickens i'm okay and

67
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,720
but he had to do the thing where he had to wear dreads and mutton chops and the dress and they

68
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,760
said it was the wrong dress and that was kind of funny and i've been playing ragnarok of course

69
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,440
and um i got my ds finally however it's not here it's at home but dan got me a black ds

70
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,640
much very similar to melton's black ds you have a blue one that melton has like a little star

71
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,320
wars thing on it's pretty neat little uh i could i could totally bust out my uh miyamoto stickers

72
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:16,800
though from e3 a few years ago but um but yes i have a nice one i babysat yesterday too really

73
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,560
yes did you play any games with the baby we went to the jungle gym and played let's splash

74
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,320
all of the water in the fountain and um baby's gonna slide down whether you're at the bottom

75
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:38,160
to catch him or not and let's see how many times catch the baby and it was also let's let's see

76
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,600
how often julian will run back to the swings and beg to be in it only to not do anything but look

77
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,240
at the other children i think the orange lounge radio official game should be something a lot like

78
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,320
wario wear where all the little micro games are like little in-jokes from the show and there

79
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,760
should be one where dark sakura is there with a big net and it says catch and baby stars and

80
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,720
there's babies falling from the sky i do have to say i do have to say and this he's such a

81
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,000
good kid that he's the reason why i'm no longer afraid of most babies in small numbers namely one

82
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,680
do you want to eat them like shane no shane has um subscriptions we we heart you shane you've

83
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,520
got subscriptions he's not listening he hates this show all right well he hates everything

84
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,600
that he likes anything else high school musical oh lord my god all right uh you're cut off all

85
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,200
right no no loki sack boy sack loki how was your gaming week um i didn't play that much this week

86
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:44,080
mainly i played um little big planet i love that game um it's actually i'm now in the japanese

87
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
level which is pretty cool so i'm dressed up like a ninja and i've got uh i'm a ninja pirate because

88
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,440
i'm wearing the ninja the ninja uh and i've got the uh pirate outfit and um i'm carrying a frying

89
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,360
pan so that's awesome and how is everyone's a little bit racist the game um pretty good but it

90
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,480
apparently uh it's not going to be as racist soon so um no i mean come on it was we were looking at

91
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
it on justin tv last week after the show it's like a little present for our live listeners and we

92
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,320
saw like a bunch of like you know that the africa level is all the africa stereotypes and you know

93
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,360
the south america level is all those stereotypes you know and the america level was hot dogs and

94
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
cheeseburgers just i know actually it was it was race cars and jazz there you go wait wait wait

95
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,080
if you go to maticas car will they shut down everything i don't know um now i'm glad though

96
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,520
when they did fix the song um that they didn't actually remove it from the game they just edited

97
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,840
out the lyrics which is awesome because the song itself was awesome and to be honest if the lyrics

98
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,800
aren't in there i'm not sad so all right whatever but um other than that i've been playing saints

99
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,240
row 2 multiplayer because that's fun still glitchy in fact we found a new trick now apparently if you

100
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
throw satchel charges on people because you can actually stick them to other players if i like

101
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,480
for example stick multiple satchel charges on when they respawn they still have the ones that haven't

102
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,680
exploded yet so you can detonate them again and kill them again which is uh kind of a boo-boo

103
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,760
there but um and then oddly enough i've been watching someone play fable can you guess who

104
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:23,120
is playing fable 2 my wife is playing fable 2 wait your wife the game hater is playing fable 2

105
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,280
yes she's playing fable 2 she here's how it happened she saw the commercial fort that they

106
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,320
have now where the guy is playing with the little uh i forget what you call those things um and

107
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,440
balls no not balls the little thing the fortune things that you open in your hand it looked like

108
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,160
a little pac-man i don't remember they call those kids in elementary school play with them anyways

109
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,200
so and each time he changes it it's a fortune kudi catcher thank you kudie catcher okay

110
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
so he's playing with that and each time he changes it it changes his appearance and

111
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
kind of looks evil and stuff like that and ellie's like what game is that that looks

112
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,640
cool because she's really into the whole people becoming evil thing you know like darth vader

113
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,880
she loved the whole like story of darth vader aren't you a little worried that your wife likes

114
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,080
it when people become evil i don't know but anyways so she's like what game is that i'm

115
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm like, oh, Fable 2. I'm like, I've had that for a while now. Do you want to play it? She's like,

116
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,040
she's all, yeah, set it up for me. So I set it up for her, kind of helped her walk through it. Now

117
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,400
she's way further in the game than I am. But granted, I've only played the game for like less

118
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,520
than an hour, so, you know. But she, she was like literally when I was leaving today to go finish my

119
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,560
costume before I came over here. She was just like, she's okay, I gotta quit in like half an

120
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,640
hour because I have to go to the gym. And she's just seriously contemplating not going to the

121
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,600
gym to play the game. Nice. Yeah. Wow. Just getting to that point. Yeah. I know it brings

122
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,520
back memories of Final Fantasy XI. I know, a proud gamer moment. Are you a proud gaming husband now?

123
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,160
I, I don't think she's gonna, she's gonna get bored with it because she's not paying attention

124
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,840
to any of the storyline or any of like what's supposed to go on. She's like, kill, kill, die,

125
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,520
die, die, kill, kill, die, die, die. It keeps giving her like helpful hints like, you know,

126
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,800
her life is low, you should go find an inn or some potion. She's like, I don't know where the

127
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,200
hell the inn is. I'm like, go to one of the towns. She's like, I went to the towns, there's no inns

128
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,160
there. I'm like, you need to look around to see if you can find it. Well, I don't know how to do

129
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,240
that. Or like she still doesn't have, she hasn't quite figured out the right analog stick so she

130
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,080
can't change the camera angle very well. Look for the building that says inn on it. I know,

131
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,600
but she doesn't have patience for that stuff. I'm like, well, she's like, what am I supposed

132
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
to be doing now? I'm like, well, what'd that guy say to you? I don't know, I wasn't listening to

133
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,520
him. Stuff like that. Let's read some comments from chat. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com. By the way,

134
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,200
I know we have a lot of people on Justin TV tonight because of a Loki being sack boy. I

135
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,320
don't know what it is. If Justin TV highlighted us or something, but please keep in mind, we only

136
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
read our regular chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com. That's not because we hate you

137
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,800
guys, Justin TV, but it's because, well, it's partially that, but no, we have a real hard time

138
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,040
reading two chat rooms at once. Cause we are trying to do a show here. So chat.orangelawnsradio.com.

139
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,480
Redertainment in chat says the last time I skipped the gym to game was five years ago. I haven't been

140
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,920
back to the gym since. There you go. All right. Anyhow, I'm assuming that's it for Loki's gaming

141
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,400
week. So I'll talk about my gaming week. Um, I finally bought a PlayStation three after all.

142
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Why are you booing? At least there's good games on it. At least you didn't buy it just because,

143
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,120
Oh, I want a PlayStation 3. Now there were finally games I wanted out. I want little big planet,

144
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
even though I wasn't able to get it yesterday, contrary to popular rumor, but I have it all set

145
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
up. I have a Blu-ray disc. At least I have Edward Scissorhands on Blu-ray cause that movie is

146
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
awesome. You have to get an Amber before Christmas too. It looks good on Blu-ray. And I like to

147
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,040
mention though that last week I was concerned that I may have to return my copy a little bit.

148
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,600
It's my turn. Sorry. So I didn't have to thank God. So I get to keep the slightly offensive

149
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
version. Awesome. All right. So yeah, I finally got, took the plunge and got a PlayStation three

150
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,280
for SingStar ABBA as well, even though that's not out till December, but I did buy SingStar

151
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,000
PlayStation three and a, you know, the game itself is kind of crappy compared to like Rob

152
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,840
Band and other songs that you can sing it. But I will tell you the best thing about SingStar

153
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,360
PlayStation three. Actually, there's a couple of good things about it. It's, it's a really good

154
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,000
party game because it has the music videos in the back. It's a, it's a good game for non-gamers.

155
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,880
If that makes sense. Like it's a good game for people to just pick up the mics and sing and have

156
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,800
fun with it. And there are a lot of songs on the SingStar, even though I haven't heard of half of

157
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,120
them. There's like 300 songs on that store, but I'll tell you the best part is that part. That's

158
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,520
like YouTube that you can go in there and look at the community videos. Um, I don't have a webcam

159
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,280
myself. Thank you very much. I don't want to put myself on there now. Don't worry about it, but

160
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,800
you can go look at other people and there are some awesome videos on there. Like they have people

161
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,440
dressed up in star Wars costumes, dancing to some of the songs, but I'll tell you that the cutest

162
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,560
ones are people that have their kids singing the song. Like there's this little three-year-old girl

163
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:55,920
singing a blink 182 dammit. And she's so cute doing it. She's like, she's so cute. And so

164
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,840
that's the best part of the game is just going on like the YouTube type thing and looking at that.

165
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,720
So I had fun with it. So, um, yeah, I don't know that it's not for everyone. Get it. If you have

166
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
a lot of parties, but if you're a solo gamer, I don't think there's a lot here for you unless

167
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,160
you like to sing to yourself. Um, otherwise I'm just holding out for a little big planet

168
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,480
and I'll probably be going back to the three 60 in the meantime. However, I will say this, uh,

169
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,240
PlayStation three has, I got to say that Blu-ray player is pretty awesome. Um, and it does upscale

170
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,880
the old movies pretty good on DVD and the media server I thought was a lot easier to use the

171
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Microsoft's servers. I was really surprised that kind of surprised me. I was thinking that the

172
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,320
three 60 media server would be a lot easier cause you know, hello windows, you know, Microsoft,

173
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,640
no, the PlayStation three one was disgustingly simple. However, here's a word of advice for you

174
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,720
folks. Don't run the media server and your internet connection at the same time. Cause

175
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,400
it can't, your internet connection can't hold it on the PlayStation three. That's the one thing

176
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,800
about it. So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week. Otherwise I haven't played a whole

177
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,760
lot. Um, Aurora faint on the iPhone, which is pretty awesome for a free game. That game is

178
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,480
all kinds of awesome. Huh? I had another game. What's that? I downloaded pull position remix.

179
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,560
How'd you like that? Um, it's actually surprisingly easy to play, but I still suck at

180
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,760
pole position. So, but the crashes and everything are fantastic. I suck the pole position. Uh,

181
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,400
black Wolf in chat room says, uh, Rob, like confirmed Rob likes parents exploiting children

182
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:29,680
on the internet. Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's cute. All right. If you don't do this,

183
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:35,520
you don't get to eat. Um, and Ross to UT says, Rob, I have media server and internet running

184
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,680
at the same time. No problem. Well, that's you. Congrats to you. All right. It didn't

185
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,520
work right for me. I know my special, but now I have all the next gen systems. So there you have

186
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,720
it. I did get, you know, if you got pole position on the phone, I will say I got Pac-Man on the

187
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,520
iPhone, which is kind of neat. Cause you can do motion. You can tilt it. Yeah. It's kind of dumb.

188
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,800
Like you play it once and then it's over. So just get the free trial. Don't pay for it.

189
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,440
But, but the pole position one though, honestly, it really is playable. And on top of that,

190
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,560
not only can you have it use motion, uh, use, uh, your tilt to turn left to right. You can choose

191
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:15,200
to have your accelerator or your brake on screen. Um, or you can actually have a steering wheel on

192
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:22,320
screen to steer with, or you can use a slider. So that's kind of cool. Um, looking in chat and I'm,

193
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,280
I lied. I looked at Justin TV chat for a minute. Um, and the, a person by the name of Sony PS3

194
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,360
sucks. So I'm sure it's just thrilled to hear my news this week says that jelly car is on iPhone

195
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,800
for free. I forgot about that. I read about that somewhere. And that was actually a really awesome

196
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,960
game on the XNA service. Um, the little beta thing they had there. So I really want to check

197
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,840
that out on iPhone. So there you go. All right. Anyhow, uh, real quickly, uh, going around and

198
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
seeing what other kinds of games, uh, people have been playing this week. Uh, Mel Chan,

199
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,600
what's one game you've been playing this week? Sadly, my Japanese coach, your Japanese coach.

200
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,160
Well, how, how exactly does it teach you Japanese? Uh, it's actually pretty neat. It's got an

201
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,400
interface that you can trace the writing so you can really learn your brush strokes and stuff.

202
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,880
It's got a bunch of fun little games to play that actually really have been helping my memory and

203
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,360
helping me remember the shit that I learned a few years ago when I actually did take Japanese class.

204
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,080
Would you say that it's something that somebody could pick up and learn Japanese with,

205
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,280
or is it better a supplement to an actual Japanese class as a supplement to an actual Japanese class?

206
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,000
But it is nice because it does have a dictionary and a phrase guide thing built into it. So if you

207
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,200
are somewhere, you need to say something that you don't exactly know how to say. You can look

208
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,320
up real quick and be like, this is what I need to say. This is how I have to say it.

209
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
Awesome. Um, Drew, what's one thing you've been playing this week?

210
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,080
World of Warcraft, the burning crew. Brains. We have a story coming on that later,

211
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,400
but how, how's Wobbling? Are you excited about Lich King?

212
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,600
Oh, very excited. I've been, uh, leveling with, uh, Camara lately. Uh, thanks to that

213
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,360
recruit a friend thing, triple experience. She and I are going through Outlands as mage and warlock

214
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,600
63. So far it's, it's a blast. What are you most looking forward to about Lich King?

215
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,840
Uh, death knights, that and motorcycles. Awesome. Uh, the doctor who, by the way,

216
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,720
brought us some mushrooms for the studio. I don't know if you can see them on Justin TV.

217
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,080
Can you hold one up for the Justin TV folks? Uh, what the mushrooms look like here. There you go.

218
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,000
Look at that. And, uh, those are awesome. Where did you make those just for this? Or did you

219
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,640
steal those from your work? Last year, my work, we did Mario as a theme for Halloween. So, uh,

220
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,520
one of my coworkers made them. Awesome. Well, thank you for stealing them and bringing them

221
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,240
here. Um, what's one game you've been playing this week, doctor?

222
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,560
Actually, Hiccup Boy has gotten me back into DDR, which, oh my God, that's like the best

223
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,440
exercise ever. You've lost some weight too. Well, maybe like, yeah, just today. Oh my God,

224
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,280
because my hand's all sweaty from DDR. What kind of DDR? What?

225
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
Um, like it's old school DDR. It's like, like extreme DDR from like the arcade.

226
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,800
So, but I love it. Like it's good. It's good times. It is. It's very good exercise. And I,

227
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,480
I like though the here on our 300th episode, somebody brings up DDR. So thank you. Oh my God.

228
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
No. And that's, I don't think a boy like you are the one of the DDR Kings. So there you go.

229
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
There you go. Uh, Arcadian. What, what's one game you've been playing this week? I picked up,

230
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,640
uh, Sonic Chronicles yesterday and play that a bit. Nice. It's actually pretty good. What system?

231
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,640
So it's a DS DS. And that's like, what is all the old school, old school Sonic games?

232
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,960
No, no, it's a new RPG. Oh, I thought it was actually called Sonic RPG. Okay. How is it?

233
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,560
Good. It's pretty good so far. I've played like a, like three or four hours. You just

234
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,800
halfway the second mission. Is there any other RPGs you can kind of compare to?

235
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,320
I don't know. It's a little bit different cause, cause you're kind of moving around with the

236
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,200
stylus and the, cause you're not, and actually cause there's an interesting system where you,

237
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,520
if you, you got to chase, sometimes you have to chase the enemies or run away from them. So you

238
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,520
have to basically have the characters running away or running towards the, uh, the, uh, the enemy.

239
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,000
So you have to like make them jump over boxes and stuff. So that kind of, so if you need to escape

240
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,360
from an enemy, you're going to kill you. You can try to do that. Or if they want to get away from

241
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,160
you, you have to chase them. So if you got four characters, it's really hard to sometimes to

242
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,080
actually keep everyone from hitting the boxes so that they don't, that they can catch up.

243
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,440
Cool. It sounds like this game might be redeeming the Sonic franchise a little bit after a relatively

244
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,560
last few week years. I actually haven't played any of the games and it's for the best. It's for

245
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,920
the best Bradley. If you want to stay a Sega fan boy, you probably should stay away from him.

246
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,840
All right. Uh, let's also ask Kick Up Boy. Uh, what, what's, what's one game you've been playing

247
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,720
this week? Well, um, I kind of haven't, haven't gotten over, um, Cod 4 at all yet. All right. A

248
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,120
shooter fan. It's amazing. Except you get those people that just like, Oh, on one on one, I can

249
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,680
kick your ass. And then we go on one on one and they leave shortly after that. So what would you

250
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,840
say is the singular best thing about that game? The best thing is gotta be just, Hmm. Uh, there's

251
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,040
not just one, uh, you looking forward to the COD five. Yeah. Yes and no. Just, they kind of went

252
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,440
back in time. So I'm kind of like, Oh, I feel like a back to the future kind of thing. What's

253
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,360
something they need to do in COD five they didn't do for four. Um, they need to, um, make sure no

254
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,280
juggernaut is allowed. Cause that's just kind of wimpy. All right. There you have it. All right.

255
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,840
Um, we're going to move into some, uh, news here, but after some housekeeping here real quick.

256
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,960
And, uh, first off I want to say, you know, cause I say it every week, join us on a live journal.

257
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,920
Our username on life journals, orange lounge or a my space where orange lounge radio, uh, on

258
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,320
Facebook or the OL army. And now on Twitter, we're OLR. Yes. That's four different sites and four

259
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,520
different names. Go figure. It just never works out. Um, also I want to say this, uh, since we

260
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,960
have been doing this diligently for 300 episodes, uh, we are taking next week off. There will be no

261
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,760
show next week. So there you have it. Cause we earned it. We will be providing live footage of,

262
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,400
um, a colonoscopy. No, I'm not. Here's the, here's the deal. I'm not having a colonoscopy,

263
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
but you guys might remember if you've been listening to the show this year, I had some

264
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,520
medical issues, um, back in April, um, that kept me out of the show for a week. Uh, I'm having

265
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,560
surgery Wednesday and that's why there's not going to be a show on Sunday because I'm still

266
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,080
going to be recovering. Um, I'm having a gallbladder removal. I'm sure I mentioned

267
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
this a couple of weeks ago. It's not a big deal. Other people have had it done. It's laparoscopic,

268
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,840
so it's not going to be a big deal, but I am planning to pretty much be out of everything

269
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,040
for a week. So there you have it. So now you understand. So no, no kicking and screaming.

270
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,200
There's no show. Take a chance to play some more games or listen to one of our other

271
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,560
wonderful shows, uh, that we co broadcast with on all games radio. Um, so let's move into some

272
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,360
gaming news then tonight, I think if we're ready. Yes. All right. All right. Uh, well,

273
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,680
you may remember the, uh, new PSP 3000 was announced and is finally made it to the market.

274
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Um, although it's not really being received that well, um, problem is apparently the new advanced,

275
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,400
um, LCD screen that's on it is causing some issues with scan lines, noticeable scan lines,

276
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,920
and it looks very bad. Um, it is now a little bit brighter and the colors are a little bit better,

277
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:14,240
but the scan lines look like crap and Sony is apparently looking into the problem right now.

278
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:23,760
Um, but no sort of fix is, um, being, uh, taken, you know, being done. And, um, so since this is

279
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,080
a phenomenon that is caused by hardware characteristics, there is no plan to fix it

280
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,720
with the system software update. So you might want to hold on to those PSP 2000s and forgo the

281
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:45,520
built-in, um, microphone and I don't know, better, uh, questionably better LCD screen.

282
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,480
Or maybe just wait a little while for it to get fixed. Is it possible that they're

283
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,800
going to like kind of fix these? Um, they're going to have to replace them if that's the case.

284
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Interesting. Um, well, what's kind of interesting also is that it seems like there might be some

285
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,800
type of very, uh, quiet under the radar recall going on right now. Um, I guess it's because

286
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,040
people are, you know, complaining about this and apparently the description actually got like this

287
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,640
slight word change going on. Um, instead of saying the system features an improved LCD screen,

288
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,600
it says the system features an advanced LCD screen. So you can kind of see that they might be,

289
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,520
uh, kind of admitting that there's something going on there. It kind of reminds me of was it, uh,

290
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,640
if anyone's watched Invader Zim when he's introduced to his sidekick Gur, he's like,

291
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,600
um, he kind of looks broken. They're all, he's not broken. He's advanced.

292
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,800
Well, here's the other interesting thing is that amazon.com just suddenly canceled a bunch of

293
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,600
pre-orders for the PSP 3000. Um, some folks had the limited edition four gigabyte memory

294
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,760
entertainment pack for this thing reserved. Amazon sent everybody emails that said, um,

295
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,720
that the item was not available from the sources so that they canceled all the orders.

296
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:05,840
Yeah. In fact, we got some similar that, um, they were expected in probably this week, I guess,

297
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,040
but now they've been delayed to middle of January. So there's something going on. Something

298
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,160
is afoot at the circle K. All right. So there you have it. Um, I don't know what's going on with the

299
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,360
PSP 3000, but maybe you want to be cautious, play a friend's system, play it in stores and see if

300
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
it's something that bugs you that bad, because I bet to a lot of gamers, um, they're not going

301
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,080
to give a shit to be honest. I mean, it looks pretty bad. I mean, but there's a lot of PSP

302
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,840
2000 systems out there and really all you're supposedly improving is the, you know, inner

303
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,480
the LCD screen, which obviously is not improved this time and a built-in microphone. So if

304
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,960
microphones aren't really big deal for you, I mean, you can go buy one for like 20 bucks.

305
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,200
I don't know. So I would just maybe hold off. Besides, why do you, why do you need to buy

306
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,720
another system? I mean, after all the last system update came about a year ago. All right. Well,

307
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,080
what was that? She didn't have a mic. I said, not to mention, there's hardly any new PSP games

308
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,840
coming out. They're like, here's a bunch of new systems without you. We've got like 20 games

309
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,320
coming out in the next six months. Have fun. All right. Well, we'll see. We'll see what continues

310
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,920
to develop, um, over there and hopefully some PSP games, a lot of good stuff in, um,

311
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,520
2009. We'll see. That could possibly be, but honestly, you know, my opinion on the PSP

312
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,800
actually is the same opinion I have on any system. It stinks only as good as the games that are on

313
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:40,640
it, but it does have purple lacrosse, which is a cute game. Okay. Well, this comes as an absolute

314
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,680
surprise to no one. Um, because what do you just like gasping into the microphone as if you're in

315
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:54,800
a porn? I'm no one. I'm no one. Do that. Do that a little bit more throaty. No, no, no, I don't.

316
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:02,400
No, no. Okay. Sorry. Anyway. Thank you, Rob. Now you have to mimic the master here.

317
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:11,440
No, I don't. Anyway. Um, well there was, um, the game was trademarked in July, but there is going

318
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,200
to be a Star Wars, the old Republic, which is the MMO that's based off of KOTOR, Knights of the Old

319
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,840
Republic. Also the term coined by our friend Krista Skrotor when she worked for Lucas back

320
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,720
in the day. Anyway. Um, with this, um, it says to be 300 years after, um, Knights of the Old Republic

321
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,720
two, which is 3,500 years before the film. And you can choose between either the Republic or the

322
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Sith empire. You can either, um, be, uh, light side or dark side. Um, but you can be one of those

323
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,400
alignments within whatever your faction is. So I guess you could be chaotic neutral or lawful evil

324
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,760
or, Oh, wait, wrong game. Anyway. Um, there's two classes that have been revealed already. That's

325
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,720
the Sith, the Jedi, and they use lightsabers and the force. And we have no idea when it's coming

326
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,440
out or what it's coming out on, but, but, but, well, can I kill Jar Jar Binks? Jar Jar has not

327
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
been born yet or conceived. She could probably find, can I find Jar Jar's super great ancestor

328
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:25,520
and killer and super great cut off the fishy cock. That's the fishy cock.

329
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,120
Did you just tell me to go slice off the fishy cock? Fish do not have cocks. They deposit their

330
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,360
things into the ocean. But they're supposed to be human led creatures. So I assume that there's

331
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,560
some cock involved. There's always cock involved. They're aquatic. Okay. Needless to say the

332
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,320
internet and the gamers on the internet all had a, needless to say the collective internet gamers

333
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,520
had a giant orgasm when this game was announced. Um, all their fish cocks went off at once.

334
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,680
Uh, I know there's a fountain of, there's a lot of people definitely looking forward to a KOTOR

335
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,680
MMO. A fountain of time ago. I've heard there are people that are going to leave wow for this.

336
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,520
We'll see, just like you and I are going to go play Star Trek. But I'm not leaving wow because

337
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,360
guess what? I am. I already left. I know. Fuck your KOTOR. We've got Star Trek MMO coming out.

338
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,680
We're going to have some Star Trek. There's a Star Trek MMO coming out? Where the fuck have

339
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,080
you been? Can I cream my shorts right now? Because I love Star Trek so much. Can you stand up so I

340
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,960
can see? Star Trek Online. This is still Star Trek Online. But what time period? Uh, after

341
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,360
current. I think it's set like 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. Oh

342
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,120
man. So you get your own joystick for your ship. Or the Klingon Empire again though. No. Yes. All

343
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,920
right. And Janeway's dead and Picard's dead. Well Janeway could still be alive. Sounds awesome.

344
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:57,440
She can. All right. Anyhow. What? You can do customizing on your ship. So you can uh,

345
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,520
calibrate the dilithium crystal. And I want there to be an achievement called Red Shirt Massacre.

346
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,000
What? Oh wait. If it's set in that series. Okay. If it was red shirts first and then yellow in

347
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,720
Next Generation, then what color are they going to go to for the next series to come out? Magenta.

348
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,800
Magenta shirts. No. All right. I'm going to get some questions or some comments from chat.

349
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,480
Rasteel UT says, what I'm concerned about with Old Republic is that A,

350
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,360
virtually, this virtually guarantees no KOTOR 3 and B, Bioware's never done an MMO before. I

351
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,840
can't shake the idea that they might try to ape WoW. WoW's a good game. Let's see. We also have

352
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,600
GS68 says, I was going to get a PSP 3000 for Christmas, but I think I'll just save for a

353
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,520
desktop arcade pop and con. We'll see. SJ100 Matt says, I'm waiting for the OLR Starfleet.

354
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,840
All right. Let's move on with some more news. Back to PlayStation 3. Well, PlayStation Home

355
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,240
isn't even out yet and it's already been hacked. So, you know, just like anything else that's Sony,

356
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,880
especially the PSP, it has been hacked. The beta client has apparently been decrypted and hackers,

357
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:18,880
especially this guy I guess named streetskaterfu, apparently he has decrypted over 9,000 files

358
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,040
belonging to it and this is supposedly going to lead to better understanding how PlayStation 3

359
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:31,440
games and the PlayStation Network works and its structure. So apparently it's all backend stuff

360
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,880
and it'll allow you to, well, they're going to hopefully allow it to lead to other exploits and

361
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,400
possibly custom stuff for the cross media bar and all that fun stuff. I don't know, right now it's

362
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,040
a whole bunch of nothing, but it's progress and progress is always good, I guess. You know what

363
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,280
I think is hilarious? That these people do this as a hobby. You know what? I bet the one, I bet

364
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,120
the best way to end all the hacking and everything is to offer these guys jobs. Oh no, they wouldn't

365
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,920
do that. It would actually be original content. We don't want that. Pay them. We want rehashes

366
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,640
of everything. Yeah, but how long before Sony tries to close this gap? I mean, the home's not

367
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,640
even out yet really. Yeah, not very long, but you know, hey, I don't know, it's neat I guess. It's

368
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,960
fun to say, hey look, I hacked home. Hey, I'm skaterfu, I hacked home. But what's kind of neat

369
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:34,000
though, speaking of the home beta, if you do want to get into the home beta, just keep an eye out

370
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,520
for the next issue of Core, which is going to do some features behind the scenes regarding home,

371
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,200
and they're also going to have home beta entries. So you will be able to test home before home

372
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,960
launches, whenever home actually launches, although it's probably going to launch soon.

373
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,200
Well, do you remember on last week's show, there was a big to-do about the whole censorship in the

374
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,680
game LittleBigPlanet, and how one of the songs controversially quoted the Quran in its lyrics,

375
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,280
and Sony was going to patch, they were really nervous about this, they're going to patch the

376
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:09,680
game, take the lyrics out. It was retarded. Well, here's the thing, it's kind of an interesting

377
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,160
follow-up to this whole thing, is that we're kind of waiting for comment from the other side, like

378
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,640
what's the community going to think, what's the rest of the Muslim community going to think if

379
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,080
this word gets out there, this is in the game. Well, you might be surprised at what happened.

380
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,600
M. Zoudi Jasir, MD, and he is the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy,

381
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,880
he talked to a website called Edge Gaming, or the Edge Game Network, and he said something

382
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:40,720
kind of interesting here. He said that censorship and Sony being willing to bend at the request for

383
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,920
censorship is counterproductive to the freedom of speech. Let me give you this quote, to demand that

384
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,360
the game be withdrawn is predicated on a society which gives theocrats who wish to control speech

385
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,240
far more value than the central principle of freedom of expression upon which the very practice

386
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,440
and freedom of religion is based. The fact that the music writer is a devout Muslim should highlight

387
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,680
that at the core of this issue is not about offending all Muslims but only about freedom

388
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,880
of expression and the free market. He says he himself does not endorse the use of the

389
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,360
Quran verses in non-educational video games, but he says in this case basically that the

390
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,800
first amendment takes precedence and that the Islamic foundation stands against all forms of

391
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,600
censorship. So, interesting. I think that's beautiful and isn't that sort of what we said

392
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:34,640
last week? In a way, in a way, so it's uh it's it it is kind of interesting to see that now Sony

393
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,280
has almost a little bit of egg on it they just can't win with this. Rice Princess was called and

394
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:47,040
she said censorship equals... Thank you. Is she coming tonight? Actually she's she's sick so she's

395
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,040
gonna try to make it. Isn't she far princess now? Yeah she is far princess. No she's sick she's

396
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,200
gonna try to make it though. All right. But you know everybody say a fire princess. All right.

397
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,280
All right. Let's move on and talk about some uh oh by the way just real quick note on Little

398
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,480
Big Planet the 1.02 patch is out now and uh it basically just strips the lyrics out of the song.

399
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,440
Yeah it doesn't take the song out just removes the lyrics which is fine. There you go. Because

400
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,600
I didn't understand what they meant anyway so we're right here. Didn't didn't they have a

401
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,960
very habit to do about this way back in the day with that game War Gods didn't they didn't uh

402
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,800
when the tracks in that game quote the Quran or something they took that out. Oh who knows.

403
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,120
This has been an issue for a while with other games you'd think people would learn.

404
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,880
I honestly... It just seems like bullshit to me the whole time. It really is. Oh sorry I should

405
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,040
be watching my language. Oh fuck that okay. It's like I said last week if they wanted to

406
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,000
be offended at somebody they should have been offended at the artist that made the song

407
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,280
who which I think is completely retarded anyway since he himself as stated was a devout Muslim so

408
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,080
whatever. Yeah but isn't that so he he was a Muslim the guy that wrote the song because there's like

00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,320
supposed to be out this week. How about Japan? Let's go over to Japan and look at the release

00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,800
dates over there on the Xbox 360. Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, Fracture and Grand Theft

460
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Auto IV all coming out this week. Again, that's Xbox 360. On the PlayStation 3, I imagine very

461
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,640
similar stuff. Yes, Fracture is also coming out on the PlayStation 3, as is Grand Theft Auto IV.

462
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,800
I guess some type of... No, is that the new one? No, we're waiting for V, aren't we?

463
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,960
So, I don't know why this is just now coming out. Grand Theft Auto IV? Oh, never mind. I'm getting

464
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,200
confused because right above it I'm reading Grand Turismo. Never mind. Hello. Okay, so yes, Japan

465
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,880
finally gets their version of Grand Theft Auto IV. Grand Turismo V Prologue does come out in Japan

466
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,920
this week. Spec 3. And Little Big Planet also makes its way to Japan this week on the 30th.

467
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:47,440
And Grand Turismo V Prologue hasn't come out in... This is Spec 3, so it's probably like new...

468
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,200
It's probably different cars to get people to buy it again. Sorry. Hey, now wait a minute.

469
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,280
Sorry for the use of that term, but that's gay. Seriously. Wait a minute, wait a minute,

470
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,040
wait a minute, wait a minute. I need to play something for Loki. Hold on, stop the show.

471
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,720
Stop the show. I need to play something for Loki here.

472
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:14,080
Hey, check out this shit, right? Right? It's so gay. It's really gay. Look at those pants.

473
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,440
Please don't say that. What? Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something

474
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:26,480
is dumb or stupid. It's insulting. It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said,

475
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:34,000
man, this pepper shaker is so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache. Just saying. When you

476
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,600
say that's so gay, do you realize what you say? Knock it off. She's so sassy. Me too.

477
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,760
All right. Her show got canceled, so she sucks. I love her. I just downloaded one of her routines.

478
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,960
All right. That's all right. I completely understand, you know, the use of, you know,

479
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,920
gay and stuff, but I know, I know. I'm just messing with you. That's the whole point. I

480
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,160
know you don't really mean it. On the Nintendo Wii, nevermind. I'm not going to get political

481
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,040
right now. Nintendo Wii, My Sims Kingdom comes out this week, as does Bokuju Monogatari,

482
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:16,880
Waku Waku Animal March, yay, on the Wii, as well as Hula Wii, Mina Di Furo Odoro,

483
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,480
and Shape Boxing, We Day Enjoy Diet. It's probably Everybody Hula Hoop,

484
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,960
which would be a very interesting game. I don't know how you make a game out of that.

485
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,600
Hey, on the PlayStation 2, Scarlet, Nichijou no Kaiyou Kaisen comes out, as well as Thunder Force

486
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:44,000
6 comes out from Sega, and Yumemi Hakusho, Second Dream makes its way to the PlayStation 2.

487
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,040
On the Nintendo DS, ChocoBox comes out, Dr. Slump and Arale-chan.

488
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,960
Is ChocoBox chocobo-boxing? Because that would be amazing.

489
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Dr. Slump was done by the artist that did Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.

490
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,800
Ah, there you go. It is chocobo-boxing.

491
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,960
Let's get back to boxing with ChocoBox.

492
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,440
ChocoBox is not a game. It's a case for your DS.

493
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,840
What are they making chocobo-boxing?

494
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,720
That'd be pretty awesome.

495
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,240
Tales of Innocence gets a price reduction, and a game called Vitamin Y comes out.

496
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,400
Why? Because.

497
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,080
Lastly, on the Sony PSP, is there anything coming out this week?

498
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,440
Well, you actually would be surprised. Yes, there's quite a bit coming out this week.

499
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,880
Cardinal Arc Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G gets a price reduction into the best,

500
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,960
as does Rockman Rockman.

501
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,360
That would just be, you know, you know how they remade Mega Man 1 for the PSP.

502
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:41,860
It's just that.

503
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,360
It's that whole thing.

504
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,920
All right, that's it for Japanese release dates.

505
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,840
Let's go back to some more gaming news.

506
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,720
Do we gotta?

507
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,360
Yes, we gotta.

508
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,480
Well, this is about death.

509
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:53,700
Cool.

510
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,740
ULTIMATE FINAL CHARACTER DEATH.

511
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:06,180
A 43-year-old Japanese woman was arrested for killing her virtual husband on MapleStory.

512
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,860
I know, where's our stupid person music, Rob?

513
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,460
Wait, did she kill him in-game?

514
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,300
She killed him in-game.

515
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,020
Oh, okay.

516
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,700
But she got arrested for killing him in-game?

517
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,620
Or did she kill him for real?

518
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,340
Here's what happened.

519
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,140
No, she killed him in-

520
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,620
She-

521
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,340
This is what happened.

522
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,020
She, um, she's a piano teacher.

523
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:34,340
43-year-old piano teacher was furious because, um, she had been divorced in-game.

524
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,020
So she accessed his login and deleted his character.

525
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,180
So she killed him in-game.

526
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:51,380
She's, um, in jail in Sapporo, um, and she's facing charges of illegally accessing a

527
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,980
computer and manipulating data.

528
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,300
Um, her in-game husband was a 33-year-old office worker.

529
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,180
And, um, I, I really don't know what he thinks, so there's no comment about that.

530
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:10,020
But this happened last May and, um, the woman could, um, pay fines and potentially

531
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,100
a five-year jail sentence if she's convicted.

532
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,020
Dude, it's MapleStory.

533
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,740
Who gives a shit?

534
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,380
God, I know!

535
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,660
Isn't that the biggest irony in this whole crappy story?

536
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,540
It's-

537
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,580
Get over yourself!

538
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,100
It's fucking MapleStory.

539
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,020
And besides that, what does it matter?

540
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,900
Oh my God.

541
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,380
Thank God.

542
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,420
I hope I can't-

543
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,860
She probably deleted, like, a couple years worth of data and-

544
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,140
I hope I can't be held accountable for all the people I killed.

545
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,660
You spend time working on that kind of shit.

546
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:39,380
DJ Dark Knight says it's a huge crime in Japan.

547
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,380
I- no, look, this is the thing.

548
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:49,300
I, I understand it and honestly, I, I would, you know, want some sort of, you know, retaliation.

549
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,220
She did break the law.

550
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,460
She illegally accessed his information and she broke the law.

551
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,980
However, I just think it's so fucking retarded that this is MapleStory!

552
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,820
It's free!

553
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,340
It's Ma-

554
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:06,980
Okay, okay.

555
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,900
I would be pissed off if someone did that to my Ragnarok account.

556
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,380
I would be pissed off if that happened on my Ragnarok account.

557
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:18,180
You know, but it's not the end of the world.

558
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,540
Five years in jail?

559
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,180
I mean, God, pissing you off is bad enough.

560
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,900
Can you imagine the phone call?

561
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,060
What do you mean pissing me off is bad enough?

562
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,540
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Rob?

563
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,100
Exactly.

564
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,620
Exactly as it was intended.

565
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,620
Can you imagine the, the phone call?

566
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,580
I'd like to report a murder of my character in MapleStory.

567
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,220
Okay, see, I was thinking of the World of Warcraft-

568
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:37,860
Hello?

569
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,980
Uh, South Park episode.

570
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,660
It's like, and, and he's killing people's characters.

571
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:48,020
Mom! Bathroom! Bathroom!

572
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,860
I am such an achievement, Hornau.

573
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,820
Um, anyhow, hey, let's move on with the news.

574
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,660
Sorry, I've been distracted because the doctor has boobs now.

575
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,740
And boobs are distracting.

576
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,180
Uh, anyways-

577
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:04,580
Ew.

578
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:05,540
So-

579
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
So that's what kind of doctor you are.

580
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,340
That's a doctor.

581
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,620
Hello, doctor.

582
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,260
Now, um-

583
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:10,660
Doctor.

584
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:18,260
Apparently, Guitar Hero World Tour is facing some drum issues, um, as some other, um, hosts,

585
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,380
uh, so, uh, viciously-

586
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,620
Eloquently put it on previous shows.

587
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,780
Viciously described, um, there's some issues with the drums, um, not sensing the hits,

588
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,740
um, in this case-

589
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,340
Sorry, that's to come later, ignore that.

590
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,500
I let the, I let the audio run too long again, my bad.

591
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:38,900
Shame, shame.

592
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,220
Fucking drums aren't fucking working right.

593
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,140
Anyway, so the drums aren't working correctly.

594
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:49,540
Basically, they're either not sensing hits, or they're just playing, not doing anything.

595
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,380
They're faulty like this show.

596
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,500
They're very faulty.

597
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,940
I mean, personally, I kind of called that they were faulty, but for whole different

598
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,340
reasons.

599
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,820
I mean, the thing looks like it's made out of PVC, and was seriously, like, rocking when

600
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,220
people were playing it, and not rocking in the good way.

601
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,540
But, I don't know.

602
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,180
I think as, uh, Bobby Blackwolf put it on his show, if they're gonna brag that their

603
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:18,500
instruments are better than, you know, Rock Band's instruments, then maybe they should

604
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:18,820
work.

605
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,780
Let's start with the working first.

606
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,060
That's the only sound my, uh, Guitar Hero drums will make.

607
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,620
I have, I have pumpkiny goodness in me, by the way, Rob.

608
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,100
Thank you.

609
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,820
You're welcome.

610
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,060
We're eating pumpkin bagels here in Studio Justino.

611
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:33,460
We are?

612
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,580
I am.

613
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,020
Yeah, that's fine.

614
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,780
Actually, eat that Halloween candy.

615
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,620
I can't have the candy, and John doesn't want it.

616
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,460
So, bring the thing out here.

617
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,660
Make everybody eat it.

618
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,700
Give some to Justin TV.

619
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:44,580
I don't care.

620
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:44,980
All right.

621
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,140
Hey, um, big news this week.

622
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,620
Oh, my God.

623
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:52,180
Huge news about, um, something, uh, we here at Orange Mountains Radio used to cover every

624
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,460
year, and then kind of stopped.

625
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,780
E3 is coming back.

626
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,300
That's right.

627
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,660
E3 2009, uh, is coming back the way we know it.

628
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:05,300
Not this whole, like, scale down show we had, um, going on.

629
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:11,060
This whole scale down show we had going on for just the media only, and the super special

630
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,900
secret club invite is going away.

631
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,300
Basically, I hope so.

632
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
E3 is going to be just like it was before.

633
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,260
However, that doesn't mean that anybody's going to be able to get in.

634
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,460
It's not public.

635
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,260
It's just, you know, it's going to be back to the same audience.

636
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:24,660
Come on.

637
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:27,700
When it was originally going on anyways, it was almost public.

638
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,260
It's like I work at Walmart or I know someone that works at Walmart in the garden department

639
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:36,180
because they, you know, it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or something like that.

640
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:41,380
It's like I work in a store that looks at video games and therefore, you know, I should

641
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:41,940
be able to go.

642
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,620
I have a crappy podcast on the internet.

643
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:44,820
It's been going for six years.

644
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,700
I get to go.

645
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,340
What?

646
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:50,020
This means that we need to get our business stuff set back up.

647
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,300
Yeah, we got to go.

648
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,340
We're going.

649
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:52,820
It'll be fun.

650
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,500
Yeah, that's going to be tough.

651
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,260
I'm going to try to get the wife to let me go, but uh, ouch.

652
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,140
Tell her Fable 3 will be there.

653
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,900
This is how it works at my house.

654
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,260
Hey Dan, I'm going to E3.

655
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,020
Okay.

656
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,140
Yeah, but you can do that.

657
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:06,980
He can come with me.

658
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,020
By the way, he's come with me every year.

659
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:16,180
The website Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q, actually interviewed the president of the

660
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:21,540
ESA, Doug Lowenstein, and he actually said if you had to give, they asked him if you

661
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:26,020
had to give E3 a six letter word or less tagline, what would it be?

662
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,140
And uh, I'm sorry.

663
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,660
Doug Lowenstein was the former president of the ESA.

664
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,860
Now it's Mike Gallagher.

665
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,780
Sorry, my bad.

666
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,140
I just haven't been to E3 in so long.

667
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,940
Mike Gallagher calls it the must attend event of 2009.

668
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:41,940
That's what he's calling it.

669
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,220
And they're saying it's going to be 40,000 or more in attendance.

670
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,860
I believe that the last E3 was 70,000.

671
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,980
And then they're complaining.

672
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:53,140
Why are there so many people going in there and then Paris Hilton will be there pimping

673
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,780
out whatever.

674
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,940
I want to know what's the heavy cynicism for there in the back.

675
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:05,140
When it was an industry only thing, it still was going down the tubes and you had better

676
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,260
things like, you know, Leipzig and uh, PAX as the true gamers conventions.

677
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,820
I mean, even for the industry, it's just not that good anymore.

678
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,460
I'm kind of curious what effect this is going to have on PAX.

679
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:20,100
If that's going to cause less people to want to go to PAX now, because they'll want to

680
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,700
use their vacation on E3.

681
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,780
Cause not everybody can take vacation all the time.

682
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,580
You know what I mean?

683
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,820
Honestly, if I had to choose between the two though, to be perfectly honest, I want to

684
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,700
go to PAX again.

685
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,900
I really want to go to PAX again.

686
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,260
You know, PAX was a lot of fun.

687
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,220
PAX was more of like the gamer show, but I'm a greedy bastard.

688
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,940
I'm going to go to both.

689
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,420
Hello.

690
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,780
No, I'd love to go to both.

691
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:43,060
I'd especially like to see what this E3 revival is, you know?

692
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,700
But if I had to pick between one or the other, I would pick PAX.

693
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,500
There you go.

694
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Uh, so orange launch radio live from E3 this June.

695
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:52,900
What?

696
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,540
If we do go to E3, we're totally freaking going to Disneyland.

697
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,380
We'll see what we can do.

698
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:57,860
We are.

699
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,300
Yes, ma'am.

700
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,700
Cause I, so what?

701
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,260
Tea cups.

702
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,700
Tea cups for the win and California screaming.

703
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:07,940
All right.

704
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,060
Let's move on with the news or we'll never get to Disneyland.

705
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:11,300
Yes.

706
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,980
But, you know what Disneyland could use more of?

707
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:15,540
Zombies!

708
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,100
You know what Call of Duty is getting more of?

709
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,940
Um, my story.

710
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,140
Well, I'm sorry.

711
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,620
You were just talking about Disneyland and I stopped listening.

712
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,120
Okay.

713
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,480
Go ahead.

714
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,900
Well, it was E3's revival.

715
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,180
What happens to E4All?

716
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,980
It gets flushed down the toilet.

717
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,300
I don't have a toilet flush noise.

718
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:43,540
Yup, there's no more E for All and I'm laughing my ass off.

719
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,340
Why? Why all the negativity? There's too much cynicism in here tonight.

720
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,340
I'm just laughing my ass off at all the people who said that, um,

721
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,980
that E for All is gonna be the end all, the place to go,

722
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,980
and we're gonna be all at E for All. And I'm like...

723
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,100
Well, it definitely was the end all. Fuck you, I'm going to PAX.

724
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,860
Nice. But seriously, I've heard from so many people about

725
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:09,220
oh, E for All this and E for All that and I'm like, screw you.

726
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:14,740
But they had fatality. Whatever. We got to, we got to do fatalities in

727
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:18,940
DC vs Mortal Kombat, okay? Oh my god, we got someone who holds his, holds his mouth funny.

728
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,900
Rob and I got to have the Katana Catwoman fight and that was

729
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,980
epic. It was pretty cool. Plus, I got to meet Jonathan Coulton and Wil Wheaton and

730
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,740
I couldn't do that at E for All.

731
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,180
Uh, Jenai in chat makes the, uh,

732
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,340
mandatory joke here that I think is pretty clever. E for End.

733
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,940
Did you hear that one, Jenai?

734
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,940
E for End. Aww, that's perfect. I was telling Mel about Wil Wheaton signing my iPhone

735
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,060
and it rubbing off by the end of the day. But you saw it.

736
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:51,500
I did see it. I'd said, now my phone is an extra limited edition and so he

737
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,060
put a 1 slash 1 on it.

738
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,300
That was pretty funny. Alright, now we can talk about zombies.

739
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,940
That's what, because that's what you're going to see at E3 this year. A bunch of unshowered, unslept zombies.

740
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:06,380
We should hand out care packs.

741
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:10,900
Okay, no, we should, we should hand out con care packs like they did at AX that one year

742
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,180
where they handed out deodorant and soap. Yeah, but unless you're going to put it on them

743
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:19,020
yourself, it's not going to do any good. What's this? Cans of

744
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:24,540
Axe. I can't use this, start away. Axe smells freaking good. Axe is better than confunk.

745
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:27,500
Confunk is good. Confunk is...

746
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know what smells better than confunk?

747
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:35,140
Cat piss. I'll take your word for it. How about zombies?

748
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:41,340
Yes, zombies. Apparently the megaton bomb that was dropped by Game Trailers TV

749
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,340
was that

750
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,340
Call of Duty World of War is going to feature a four-player co-op zombie mode.

751
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:50,060
That totally doesn't rip off of another game that's very similar having a

752
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,100
four-player co-op

753
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:54,260
zombie mode in it. Left 4 Dead.

754
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,260
So I guess, you know, hey they want to make sure that people know that their game has

755
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,380
zombies too.

756
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:04,820
Wow, that's so World of War. You know, I remember the zombie wars back in World War II.

757
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,420
My grandpa used to tell me all about those, how the zombies would attack and

758
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:08,980
everything.

759
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:12,700
Ah, yes, the zombies.

760
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,940
Thank goodness that we, you know, defeated them and showed them democracy.

761
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,740
Democracy! Bringing it to the rest of the world. And

762
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:26,460
no zombies, because zombies are bad. But thankfully though Treyarch is able to come

763
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,540
back and tell the

764
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:30,900
you know, lost battles of zombies. You know,

765
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,700
the part that was left out of the history books. Conspiracy, I say!

766
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,220
No, but seriously, they're going to have four-player zombies and you'll be able to do

767
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:42,420
zombie stuff. Can you eat brains? Yes or no?

768
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:47,300
Well this sounds like it's basically, it's kind of weird though. There's a whole bunch of

769
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,220
games this fall that have zombie things in them. Like

770
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,700
Saints Row 2 has zombies in it. There's like a zombie game within the game.

771
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,700
And now there's a zombie game within this. And then there's a zombie game coming out.

772
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,420
There's zombie

773
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,180
Xbox Live Arcade games. Zombie PlayStation Network games. It's like, seriously,

774
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,140
Moonwalker!

775
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:07,580
Brains or no brains? Actually, I do have to say there's something that completely

776
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,260
bothers me about zombie games.

777
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,300
About games with zombies in them. How you don't have a stench meter.

778
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,420
In zombie movies and zombie games,

779
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:21,100
why is it that you can't tell where the fucking zombies are by how much their decayed

780
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:25,300
asses stink? They're decaying bodies. They're going to smell

781
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,020
like rotten meat. Maybe someday there'll be a smell-o-vision.

782
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,220
But, you know, nobody in zombie movies are so surprised that the zombies are there

783
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:38,220
when they should have been able to freakin' smell corpse stench. Yeah, I know. You have games like, I don't know,

784
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,620
Thief with sound meters. Why can't you have smell meters? Maybe there's a lot of zombies and so

785
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,100
because they all smell like rotting flesh, the whole place smells like rotting

786
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,300
flesh so you can't tell where it's coming from. It should still be stronger the closer you

787
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,240
get to that much

788
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,700
contained stench. It's just... It's like an anime con.

789
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,700
It's just like last night. You can tell when you're getting close to the dealer's room

790
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:02,420
by the stink. No, no, no, no. You can tell when you're getting close to the cosplay

791
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,500
competition

792
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,160
It's like a Dave Matthews Band concert. You can tell when you're getting close to

793
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,500
the smell of marijuana.

794
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,460
No, when you're getting close to the cosplay competition is when you stop

795
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:13,980
smelling

796
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,540
funk and start smelling other things. I don't know if you heard Drew, but

797
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,540
the Grateful Dead. The one guy's keeping on trucking in heaven.

798
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,540
I don't know if you've heard. Alright. He's gratefully dead.

799
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,300
Anyhow. Unless he's a zombie! In which case,

800
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,500
you need to know how to defeat zombies by playing this game. Or

801
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,420
Left 4 Dead. Or Saints Row 2. Or another zombie game. World of Warcraft.

802
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,820
Which has also started the zombie invasion. That's right. Zombie invasion has been hitting World of

803
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,960
Warcraft and there's been just craziness going on.

804
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,180
Earlier in the week, there was infections going on. If you would kill an

805
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,180
infected critter

806
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:51,380
or the like, you would get turned into a zombie in 10 minutes and then you

807
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,900
could create other zombies. It was like a disease that was spread around.

808
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,980
Well, as the week's been going on, now it takes 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.

809
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:01,860
15 seconds? I thought it was one minute. No, that happened to me earlier today. It took me 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.

810
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,060
The more you get hit by zombies, the faster they shave off

811
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:08,340
times. You gotta visit an Argent healer.

812
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,620
Or if they haven't been turned into a zombie. Or you have a priest or paladin

813
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,580
remove the disease. All last night I was going on my priest

814
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:20,580
through Orgrimmar making sure all the auction house street dealers were

815
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,420
clean. Yeah, apparently it's a popular thing to do is turn yourself into a zombie and then do

816
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,360
a zombie explode. Because one thing you can do, you can just explode. You can self-destruct as a zombie

817
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,100
and spread your infection everywhere. So a lot of people have just been walking into the

818
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,060
auction house and exploding.

819
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:39,060
And apparently they don't like the people who are cleaning up after the

820
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:39,740
zombies.

821
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,420
They don't like the priests. They don't like the pallys. Oh, you're ruining our fun.

822
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,740
Hi, you guys are going to low-level zones and killing everything. Exactly.

823
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,900
You know, does anyone find this slightly offensive that there's

824
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,380
people walking around into, I don't know, public buildings and exploding?

825
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:58,940
I mean... There's zombies. Don't blame them, there are zombies.

826
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:02,380
Everything is okay when it's zombies and green blood.

827
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:06,060
It's not real. There were zombies that ate too many Twinkies. So if some zombies flew a

828
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,300
plane into a building, that would be okay too.

829
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,780
They're zombies! Matt... I'm just checking.

830
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:16,860
Alright, because this is the World of Warcraft game that you're playing, and I don't see any

831
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,220
recalls on that. Yes, alright.

832
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:21,620
Well, we did have people getting infected and then

833
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:24,900
flying to other cities and then exploding when they got there. The

834
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,220
zombified in mid-flight.

835
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:31,080
You can't explode in mid-flight? They can't explode in mid-flight, but they can explode as soon as they land.

836
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,780
Tenris Murkblood is a new boss that you can fight in Karazhan. My guild just took him

837
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,700
down today, and it was actually a fun fight.

838
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,180
But you only are going to be able to see him for 10 days, which basically means if

839
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,980
you don't play him tonight or Monday,

840
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:46,900
you have one chance because of the resets in Karazhan. So, he drops an axe that is

841
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,580
awesome. He will drop this axe every time. He only drops two things. A little bat pet for

842
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,520
everybody in the raid,

843
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,500
and an axe that when you use it,

844
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,140
your character suddenly becomes a zombie or an undead, basically.

845
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,420
It starts jamming like it's Guitar Hero. It goes...

846
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,860
It's awesome. Rob, get an extra one.

847
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:11,820
We can't. Only Nathan got one today. Look at that! Now they're ripping off Darkstalkers! Awesome!

848
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,780
Arcanite Ripper!

849
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,020
Arcanite can rip off.

850
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:19,940
Yeah, and I see XLink in chat says, Grand Theft Auto IV has zombies too.

851
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:23,500
Yeah, they started putting out this thing like it was going to be an expansion or something like that,

852
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,700
but really they're just talking about the stupid

853
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:30,580
viral achievement that they've had since the beginning of the game, when it came out.

854
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:32,100
And...

855
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,980
Tom, talk about like non-news, but they decided, hey, we're going to jump in on the zombie

856
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,660
fun as well, even though

857
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:42,180
this has been around forever. I want to point out, since we just started tonight's show,

858
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,660
a new phase just kicked in. Phase five and a half just started tonight

859
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,580
as we went live. Apparently what's happened, now there are quests all of a sudden

860
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,580
available in the main cities that send you to the faction leader,

861
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:57,260
and at some point you're going to be whispered by some type of either

862
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:00,740
a frozen shade or a plagued brain that's going to be taunting you to join their

863
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,860
forces.

864
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,260
And there's some type of quest going on to hopefully clean the world

865
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,660
of the plague. Interesting.

866
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:11,460
So it's all going on right now in the world of Warcraft.

867
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,740
Bathroom.

868
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,860
Bathroom.

869
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:20,460
More gaming news.

870
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:25,060
Well, there's another game called Pain,

871
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:29,100
and there is a character showing up in Pain

872
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:34,140
that you can beat the shit out of. Guess who that would be?

873
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,220
I don't know. David Hasselhoff!

874
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,500
And he actually thinks that it's

875
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,700
completely, he actually said that it was hysterical, he's quoted as saying that,

876
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:47,220
and that

877
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,620
he thinks that it's really great that he gets to be in it.

878
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,320
And there's also his version of Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?

879
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,920
as

880
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:02,340
the title to an in-game track, so I think that's pretty fun. Wow, you know that's just...

881
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:06,180
What the fuck was that? Rob's computer farted. I don't know what's going on. Well, hello

882
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,940
Rice Princess, glad to see you just arrived. I think a zombie is attacking us, actually.

883
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:15,300
What the hell was that about? That was some weird shit. Anyways, I was going to say,

884
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,540
that's reason enough to hurt him.

885
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,220
Well, also he's doing his own voice, so this information was provided to me by

886
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:25,180
the lovely and talented Zoss.

887
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:29,220
Now I want to point out there's a new song available in Pain.

888
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:34,220
I can't stop this feeling

889
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:38,220
deep inside of me

890
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:41,220
Girl, you just don't realize

891
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:44,220
what you do to me

892
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:48,220
I couldn't resist. You gotta love a guy that actually is famous for doing that shit.

893
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:52,220
I mean, seriously, you know what, it's like, I wonder if he's just like,

894
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:56,220
what can I do that's so ridiculous that people would still like me? And he keeps

895
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,220
making these songs and he's like, okay, people gotta hate me now. And then they're still like

896
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,220
buying his albums and he's still rich and putting them on TV shows and stuff.

897
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:08,220
I don't know.

898
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:12,220
He's still convinced that he's instrumental in the Berlin Wall coming down.

899
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,220
Rama in chat says... They love him in Germany. Rama in chat

900
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:20,220
says, I actually like this song. I only read that so that our, you know,

901
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:24,220
thousands of listeners could hear that. That's Rama, R-A-N-M-A, likes that song.

902
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:28,220
DSSJ100 Matt says, we got Hofrolled.

903
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:32,220
Yes you did. Yes you did. Alright, a little

904
01:06:32,220 --> 01:06:36,220
more gaming news than the classic Game of the Week and then a break.

905
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:40,220
If you bought Rock Band 2, you'll know that on the back of your manual, it says you can get 20

906
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:44,220
free tracks available at a later date. Well, that later date is

907
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:48,220
now November 4th and there are 20 different tracks you can get.

908
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:52,220
And to be honest, I don't know any of these artists at all.

909
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:56,220
So, real quick I'm going to read them off. The 88 Sons and Daughters.

910
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,220
Authority Zero, no regrets. Between the

911
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:04,220
Buried and Me, prepare to the sequel.

912
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:08,220
The Cab with Bounce. The Chevelle's, get it on.

913
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,220
The Cocktail Slippers, give it to me. Dealership

914
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:16,220
with Database Corrupted. End Ever After

915
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:20,220
with I Wanna Be Your Man. The Ghost Town's Ashes to Fire.

916
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:24,220
Hollywood Undead, Young. The Cutlass,

917
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:28,220
The Feeling. The Len Price 3,

918
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:32,220
If I Ain't Got You. Lesley Roy, I'm Gone, I'm Going.

919
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:36,220
Opiate for the Masses, Burn You Down.

920
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:40,220
Semi-Precious Weapons, Magnetic Baby.

921
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:44,220
Shamius with Like a Fool. Magnetic Baby?

922
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:48,220
I don't know. The Nuno 2, Crazy Tuesday.

923
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,220
Tickle Me Pink with The Time is Wrong.

924
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,220
Under oath with Desperate Times, Desperate Measures, and X Japan with

925
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:00,220
IV. I have no idea any of those songs.

926
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:04,220
I know that actually we were really excited about getting some X Japan.

927
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:08,220
But hey, at least they're free, and free is awesome.

928
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,220
No bitching, it's free. And there might be some cool songs in there that you've never heard of before.

929
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:16,220
So make sure that you register before the 4th, I mean you probably can afterwards, but if you

930
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:20,220
want to make sure you get it day 1, register at rockband.com slash

931
01:08:20,220 --> 01:08:24,220
bonus tracks, and they will send you an email with your code

932
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:28,220
to download them once they become available.

933
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:32,220
Awesome. What about what they're releasing for the people that want to pay?

934
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:36,220
Well, for the people that want to pay, there's going to be some other stuff coming out as well.

935
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:40,220
Including, they've got Hong Kong Gardens,

936
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:44,220
Kiss Them For Me, and Killing Jar.

937
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:48,220
Yay! And that's all by Soozee and the band Cheese.

938
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,220
Yay! Which is like one of the greatest bands ever. Dammit by Blink

939
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:56,220
182, that song that Rob was talking about the little girl singing earlier

940
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:00,220
in Sing Star. Let's see here, looks like

941
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,220
Metal Onan by the Silver Star, or Silver Sun

942
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,220
Pickups. Well Thought Out Twinkies by

943
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:12,220
or Twinkles, Twinkies would be funny though. Well Thought Out Twinkles

944
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:16,220
by Silver Sun Pickups, and Pretty In Pink by Psychedelic Furs.

945
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,220
That's cool. You know what though, who cares, because it has Soozee and the band Cheese

946
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:24,220
in it, so all the rest of that is just crap.

947
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,220
Oh my god,

948
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:32,220
Rob are you straight now? No, I just

949
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:36,220
love Soozee and the band Cheese, they're awesome. She was on the Basement Jacks song too.

950
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:40,220
They had a really cool video on top of it.

951
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,220
There you go. Kish Cash. It's funny, my band right now

952
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:48,220
thankfully, because I'm not playing Rock Band 2, but my friend is on my account

953
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:52,220
so it counts, but we're in the top 600 now.

954
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:56,220
Wow. Dang. Yes, I know, I'm

955
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:00,220
very pleased at my progress in the game. Oh, just to let

956
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:04,220
people know, our band name at my house is Detachable Penis.

957
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:08,220
Like the King Missile song. Did it not get banned? No. Interesting.

958
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:12,220
The one I've been playing in mostly is actually Shane's band, it's Emergency Kittens.

959
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:16,220
That's the name of our band. Does the Sassy Squad sing backup? No.

960
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:20,220
That's just a Warcraft fan. But is Fluffles Trainset the third?

961
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:24,220
No. Alright, hey, by the way

962
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:28,220
if you want a real band game, you know, the hell with Rock Band or Guitar Hero

963
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:32,220
get Rock Revolution. No, I'm kidding, I'm just so kidding. No, you want this

964
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:36,220
Strong Bad Episode 3, The Baddest of the Bands

965
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,220
is coming out. It's Episode 3, it comes out on the PC and WiiWare

966
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:44,220
when? Right now. Or Monday for those of you listening live, it's tomorrow.

967
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:48,220
October 27th, it's going to be as always 1,000 Wii Points or

968
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:52,220
$10. That's coming out from Telltale Games. So there you have it

969
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:56,220
those of you that are enjoying the Strong Bad games probably want to pick that up. And if you haven't

970
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,220
picked up a Strong Bad game yet, you might want to do that. And yes, I'm talking to myself

971
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,220
because I still have not played the Strong Bad series. I really need to. Is the

972
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:08,220
ban over, Rob? No, you know your boycott's not over yet, is it? No, I can play it on PC.

973
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:12,220
That's right. So that's what I plan to do. Oh, your boycott, because your memory

974
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:16,220
is full. Yeah, I'm boycotting the Wii download stuff. Your memory is full. Although, well

975
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:20,220
I don't know, I'm iffy on it because they have announced the remedy for it.

976
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,220
Wait, what did, have you already announced that on the show, what the remedy is? Yeah, they

977
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:28,220
did announce they are going to let you run things off SD cards. But when's that happening, though?

978
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:32,220
That's a thing. So that's going to be a patch, right? Yeah, probably a patch. Alright, anyhow

979
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:36,220
hey, we're not even halfway done with this show yet, if you can believe it. We're going to take a

980
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:40,220
break here pretty soon. But first, we always like to end part A of our program by

981
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,220
taking a trip to the past and revisiting the archives and

982
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,220
trying to pick out a classic game of the week. Now, as I understand

983
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:52,220
though, tonight's game, because it is episode 300, Dark Sakura had to

984
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:56,220
pick like a fucking epic classic. Am I correct? I sure did.

985
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:00,220
Alright, well let's get to it.

986
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:04,220
My classic game, actually I'm not going to say the title of it to

987
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:08,220
begin with. It should begin with the intro to the game.

988
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:12,220
Which everyone will get from the first Tones.

989
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:16,220
And I'm getting grins from over here looking at my laptop.

990
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:20,220
Oh my god. Oh my god.

991
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:24,220
Oh my god.

992
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,220
Oh my god.

993
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:32,220
That only sounds like a porn star.

994
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:36,220
Oh yeah. Do we get it yet

995
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:40,220
kids? Oh yeah. No it's not Castlevania.

996
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:44,220
It's Gutsman.

997
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:48,220
Oh yeah. Tora is the first person to guess.

998
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:52,220
And stop spamming the room now please. You get a no prize.

999
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:56,220
Stop it! Okay, someone kick Tora out of the chat room please.

1000
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,220
Right the fuck now.

1001
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:04,220
Thank you. Okay, the classic game is Final Fantasy

1002
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:08,220
6, which we got over here on Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy 3.

1003
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:12,220
Play the best music in the game ever please.

1004
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:16,220
This is the overworld music, which is also called Terra's theme.

1005
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:22,220
Although in the Japanese version her name was Tina.

1006
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:26,220
Best music in the game. Sorry.

1007
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:30,220
That's just my own opinion. And Sausa's best game ever.

1008
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:34,220
I think this is probably one of the best video game songs ever.

1009
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,220
This game is the reason why I skipped a week of high school.

1010
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,220
While I had the flu. But that's beside the point.

1011
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:46,220
My flu was prolonged. No, no. I started off having the flu and my grandma rented the game for me.

1012
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:50,220
And I ended up just having the flu a little bit longer than I really did.

1013
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:54,220
But the one thing about this one is it was the first in the series

1014
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:58,220
that was not done by Sakaguchi. It was done by Yoshinori Kitase

1015
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:02,220
and Hiroyuki Ito. And this is

1016
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,220
considered pretty much the pinnacle of it. Although I really, really like Final Fantasy 5

1017
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:10,220
a whole lot too. It has the largest

1018
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:14,220
playable cast of any Final Fantasy game to date.

1019
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:18,220
Pretty much it's standard Final Fantasy.

1020
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,220
You have your overworld map and you have your dungeons and you have

1021
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,220
your towns and you've got your chocobo

1022
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:30,220
and you have your airship and random encounters on land.

1023
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,220
This one also has your

1024
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,220
espers which give you your magic and you keep improving.

1025
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:42,220
And it's still menu based combat. I mean it's Final Fantasy

1026
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:46,220
basically. There were a few different

1027
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:50,220
innovative attacks. Like Selle's had the runic attack which could reflect

1028
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:54,220
magical attacks back at somebody.

1029
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:58,220
Although I'll be honest, I rarely ever freaking use that except for that one battle where you had to.

1030
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:02,220
And I'm actually still playing this right now too.

1031
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:06,220
But this has, for the active time

1032
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:10,220
battle system, you actually can pick any character that has

1033
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:14,220
filled up their action bar and you don't have to pick

1034
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:18,220
the first one that pops up. You can actually change out which one you want to use as long

1035
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:22,220
as their bar is their first.

1036
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:26,220
And this actually was incorporated into later ones. You could customize

1037
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:30,220
your characters by your relics to change their stats.

1038
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:34,220
You could work with their spells a little bit. You could equip their

1039
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:38,220
magicite which is like I was saying is basically some of the espers

1040
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:42,220
helps with magic. They have the magic acquisition points for each time.

1041
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:46,220
You gain APs. You level up. This particular game

1042
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:50,220
is where basically you've got

1043
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:54,220
this one girl named Terra in the Japanese version. It was

1044
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:58,220
Tina. And they find her and she can do magic.

1045
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:02,220
And everyone's like, Oh my god! Magic! I'm going to barf! And then the rest of the story

1046
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:06,220
comes off. This also has Kefka which is the

1047
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:10,220
most annoying laugh

1048
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:14,220
in a video game ever.

1049
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:18,220
Somebody poison the water hole!

1050
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:22,220
But he had the best boss theme ever.

1051
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:26,220
Actually I really like Jenova's better. But anyway.

1052
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:30,220
The one other really cool thing that I thought about this game is that it's very

1053
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,220
punk. Really it is. I mean you've got

1054
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,220
steam powered mecha in the game. It's all very

1055
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:42,220
early industrial. Magitek. You have your magitek armor.

1056
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:46,220
You've got you know the empire in that is pretty much

1057
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:50,220
a magical industrial type

1058
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:54,220
mesh. I know it's so fantastic. And you have toilets in it. You can use the toilet. Did you know that?

1059
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:58,220
What if you don't use the toilet? Because in Sims that's not good.

1060
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:02,220
If you're in the empire castle or whatever

1061
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:06,220
and you're in one of the cells you can actually sit on the toilet and squat down on it.

1062
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,220
And then when you hop off the toilet it flushes.

1063
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:14,220
Do they take down their little pants to do that?

1064
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:18,220
No they have a trap door. They do? Okay.

1065
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:22,220
Also Saw says it has the freakiest clown in a video game ever.

1066
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,220
But you've got some of the best characters in this.

1067
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:30,220
I actually really liked

1068
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:34,220
GoGo. I really liked GoGo.

1069
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:38,220
Because of the weird stuff he did. I loved Gal who was the

1070
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:42,220
little feral boy. And Mog wasn't

1071
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:46,220
you get Mog.

1072
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:50,220
I don't know why we're having mic issues in studio.

1073
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:54,220
Is it? Oh keep it away from interference. I'm sorry. But Rob do me a favor

1074
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:58,220
Alright I'll try to find it.

1075
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,220
This game had the single most hardcore awesome character in it.

1076
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:06,220
Which was um. We'll get to him in a second.

1077
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:10,220
But the main characters you have Terra slash Tina. You've got Locke who's your thief.

1078
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:14,220
You have Sillies who's treasure hunter.

1079
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:18,220
You have Sabin who's your martial artist.

1080
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:22,220
This is a special rendition of it. Oh no wait. Here we go.

1081
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:26,220
But here's the man.

1082
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:38,220
Shadow the ninja. Who we used to call Snake Eyes.

1083
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:42,220
And you have Realm was cool. She had the drawing

1084
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:46,220
attack. And you had her grandfather who's the blue mage. And you had

1085
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:52,220
what's-his-face who looked like Billy Dee Williams.

1086
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:56,220
Who was the Doma castle guy.

1087
01:18:56,220 --> 01:19:00,220
But he looked like Billy Dee. Sorry he looks like Billy Dee Williams.

1088
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:04,220
Edgar was the best. I bet he does. Edgar was awesome.

1089
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:08,220
Because it was all about the autocrossbow.

1090
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:12,220
And the chainsaw.

1091
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:16,220
And the graphics actually were

1092
01:19:16,220 --> 01:19:20,220
the characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano and they were

1093
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:24,220
actually converted to sprite.

1094
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:28,220
And there were also

1095
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:32,220
in the Playstation version that came out later

1096
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:36,220
the actual videos that were in the game

1097
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:40,220
were directly from Amano's designs. That was pretty cool.

1098
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:44,220
It was one of the, it's not the first one that used mode 7 but it used

1099
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:48,220
extensive mode 7 in this for lots of

1100
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:52,220
scaling and scrolling. It was really fantastic.

1101
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:56,220
When it was localized there were changes

1102
01:19:56,220 --> 01:20:00,220
like a little bit of nudity. For

1103
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:04,220
example. One of the painting bosses.

1104
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:08,220
Yes one of those. Also

1105
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,220
different characters for their full names. They romanized them differently

1106
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:16,220
so that they would fix a six, fit a six character slot.

1107
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:20,220
They were also changed quite a bit from Terra to Tina from

1108
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:24,220
Mash to Sabin. From Kayen to Sion.

1109
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:28,220
But I think that they

1110
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:32,220
picked it in the way that people would most be able to

1111
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:36,220
relate to it. Text, a lot of

1112
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:40,220
dialogue was shortened. Because again

1113
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:44,220
it could only store a certain number of characters

1114
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:48,220
and I'm sorry Japanese lends itself a lot easier to extended conversation

1115
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,220
within a limited character allotment because it's syllabic and

1116
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:56,220
English isn't. This

1117
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:08,220
is so awesome.

1118
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,220
This is the opera scene which is

1119
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:16,220
to this day I think one of the most memorable ever scenes

1120
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:20,220
in any video game ever are.

1121
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:24,220
It really is. Did you see

1122
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:28,220
what they did for the Dear Friends concert

1123
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:32,220
where they did the opera scene

1124
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:36,220
in Japanese. I saw YouTube of it. It was just

1125
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:40,220
fantastic. It was so beautiful. And here's actually

1126
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:44,220
one that we should realize

1127
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:48,220
about the music. We've kept bringing up the music during

1128
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:52,220
this. It was actually done by Uematsu

1129
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:56,220
who wrote all of the music in the game.

1130
01:21:56,220 --> 01:22:00,220
Did everything for every location, all the battles

1131
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:04,220
different themes. They actually use the music

1132
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:08,220
from the games in Japanese music classes in Japan.

1133
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:12,220
Also they wanted to

1134
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:16,220
use an actual voice for the opera but the SBC

1135
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:20,220
700 chip would not allow an actual

1136
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,220
voice track so that's why they used

1137
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:28,220
the...well it would basically be

1138
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:32,220
the Vox Organa or Vox Humana thing

1139
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:36,220
for organ is what I recognized.

1140
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:40,220
The sound chip itself didn't support the voices but later on

1141
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:44,220
you had games like Tales of Fantasia and Star Ocean that did have

1142
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:48,220
actual voice samples. But we're talking about full vocal track.

1143
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:52,220
It wouldn't support a full vocal track. It would support

1144
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:56,220
something that was short.

1145
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:00,220
The last Metroid is in captivity.

1146
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:04,220
The galaxy is at peace. It's about as much as you can get.

1147
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:08,220
Or the clay fighters opening.

1148
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,220
For the Final Fantasy 6 Grand Finale

1149
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:16,220
album it actually was rearranged as an aria using

1150
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:20,220
an actual singer in full

1151
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:24,220
accompaniment and this version was also in the full motion

1152
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:28,220
video in the Playstation version so it was pretty cool.

1153
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:32,220
You can actually get...I've got the full soundtrack

1154
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:36,220
to this. You can get all kinds of arranged versions but there's also

1155
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:40,220
some pretty good versions of this

1156
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:44,220
some of the music in the game and some of the Final Fantasy compilation

1157
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:48,220
discs. Although I still think

1158
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:52,220
that the best of the compilation ones, which I don't think has any from this game in it, is still

1159
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:56,220
Celtic Moon and Prey was very good. Prey had some stuff in here.

1160
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:00,220
We did, like I said, we got a Playstation version

1161
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:04,220
but there's also Final Fantasy 6 Advance

1162
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:08,220
which came out on DS. There's four new espers in this one which is

1163
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:12,220
Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar and Diabolos.

1164
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:16,220
I think it was on Game Boy Advance. Sorry, that's the Game Boy Advance one.

1165
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:20,220
I wish it was on DS, that'd be awesome. Yeah, well that's the one I've been playing through until my

1166
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:24,220
DS broke. Also

1167
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:28,220
for this game, as of March 31, 2003

1168
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:32,220
it shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide

1169
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:36,220
which is 2.6 million in Japan alone and

1170
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:40,220
860,000 overseas and continued to be one

1171
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:44,220
of the best selling games of all time. Did you, in that week that you were home

1172
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,220
with it, did you beat it in the week, did you play it like non-stop? No, I didn't actually.

1173
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:52,220
You should have. I've had tons of other stuff to do. I'm in school, dude.

1174
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:56,220
Anyway, another neat thing about this though

1175
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:00,220
and this is what made me all hyper, is that when

1176
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:04,220
I don't know if you remember when the Nintendo 64 was in

1177
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:08,220
production, or sorry, when testing, they actually made

1178
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:12,220
a demonstration for the Nintendo 64 using

1179
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,220
the cast from Final Fantasy

1180
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:20,220
7 in a big battle, I think versus Bahamut

1181
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:24,220
which I found video of finally and it's freaking crazy looking.

1182
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:28,220
Which is what we're looking at right now in studio. It was gonna be too expensive, right, to put

1183
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:32,220
on a cartridge to do the game, right, for Final Fantasy 7?

1184
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:36,220
Well, basically it was actually done on Silicon Graphics hardware

1185
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:40,220
when they first put it out, but Square hadn't yet committed

1186
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:44,220
and the technology in the game was

1187
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:48,220
not up to their parts. They actually wanted to move it to PlayStation for the sake of full motion video.

1188
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:52,220
Which the PlayStation, of course, could easily handle.

1189
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:56,220
But the demo actually had

1190
01:25:56,220 --> 01:26:00,220
Terra, Locke, and Shadow.

1191
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:04,220
And it was controlled actually through using a mouse

1192
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:08,220
instead of, you know, actual, like with a control.

1193
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:12,220
There was also Final Fantasy 6, the interactive CG game

1194
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:16,220
which was actually also called Final Fantasy X.

1195
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:20,220
Not a Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X.

1196
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:24,220
Which was the same demonstration, but with

1197
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:28,220
better touch-ups, textures.

1198
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:32,220
Oh no, this was basically...

1199
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:36,220
But this was basically what they were using.

1200
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:40,220
It was a sort of

1201
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:44,220
touchdown version that they were using for the Nintendo 64

1202
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:48,220
demo test, but this was more

1203
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:52,220
to demonstrate the actual use of CG in the

1204
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:56,220
thing, so that's pretty cool.

1205
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:00,220
So that's our classic game is Final Fantasy 6.

1206
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:04,220
Oh good, because I was running out of music. That was long. That's alright. It's worth it.

1207
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:08,220
That game deserves it. I knew that this game would require a ton of

1208
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:12,220
attention, so

1209
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:16,220
how could we not dedicate more time to it? And it's Episode 300.

1210
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,220
I mean, hell, we have to pick the pinnacle. Alright. I don't know how you're going to follow that

1211
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:24,220
next week. Alright. Because it's not better than Super Metroid.

1212
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:28,220
Whatever. You know what? Honestly, you know, I actually like

1213
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:32,220
Final Fantasy 6 even more so than I do Chrono Trigger, so if any game you're going to say competes

1214
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:36,220
for the best game of all time next to Super Metroid, I could see Final Fantasy 6.

1215
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:40,220
I would actually say Final Fantasy 6 is overall...

1216
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:44,220
Now, I used to say I really liked Final Fantasy 5

1217
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:48,220
a whole lot, and I'll probably do that as a later game, because

1218
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:52,220
of how customizable the job change system was, and Final Fantasy 3 was the

1219
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:56,220
first one to do that of the Japanese releases, which was actually

1220
01:27:56,220 --> 01:28:00,220
really fun, too. If anyone can find a translation of it, play it. It's fantastic.

1221
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:04,220
Well, they've got it on DS. They have it now, but I mean, like, the old one.

1222
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:08,220
But Final Fantasy 6, I think, for storytelling,

1223
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:12,220
for just how drawn in it brings you into everything, for

1224
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:16,220
all the detail, and I mean, flushing toilets, a first for any Final Fantasy

1225
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:20,220
game. I mean, but with the opera, by the time you get to the opera, there's

1226
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:24,220
like this epic, crazy stuff, and so much has gone on already, and

1227
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:28,220
you just, you're like, oh my god, this is some crazy adventure.

1228
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:32,220
Plus, it's all about the

1229
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:36,220
X-Zone. And the Vanish

1230
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:40,220
Doom. No, it was...

1231
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,220
X-Zone was the one I used, but it was all about that.

1232
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:48,220
Alright, we're gonna wrap up, or we're gonna have no time for Skype calls in Part B. We're gonna

1233
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:52,220
move on and take a break, but hey, don't go away. There'll be plenty more of Orange Launch Radio.

1234
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:56,220
Some more news coming in Part B. We've got a new technology Microsoft might be

1235
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:00,220
building so that people will stop swearing on Xbox Live. I can't wait to see what people

1236
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:04,220
have to say about this. Yeah, I know. Aw, fuck. Alright. So anyway,

1237
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:08,220
we'll be talking about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1238
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:12,220
And for those of you guys

1239
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:16,220
listening live tonight, we have, for tonight's free break, your shout outs

1240
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:20,220
from our voicemail. So enjoy. We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1241
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:24,220
Music

1242
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:28,220
Music

1243
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:32,220
Hey all our crew, happy 300k. Here's the turnaround of all our

1244
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,220
legendary DSX-B8. Yes, this voicemail is about the

1245
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:40,220
value of the all our tech, or the never-ending trans class in DMN case.

1246
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:44,220
Hey, hey, hey! What's up? Dan Chateau here.

1247
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:48,220
So, 300. Episode

1248
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:52,220
300. Wow. 300. Really?

1249
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,220
I can't even get one. Can't get one?

1250
01:29:56,220 --> 01:30:00,220
Just one. Really? No.

1251
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:04,220
300. Wow, man. Cool.

1252
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:08,220
Yeah. 300. Sure.

1253
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,220
Okay. Bye. Okay. Hi, it's

1254
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:16,220
Goldampero. I haven't really left a message to

1255
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:20,220
talk to you guys for a while, but I'm, and even though I'm probably

1256
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:24,220
going to be there, I'm probably not going to be there just because of the stupid school reasons.

1257
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:28,220
So, hope you guys, your 300 episode is really good and I'll

1258
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:32,220
send it on the podcast. Anyway, real quickly, I want to tell my game

1259
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:36,220
spot so I can stop the story. Basically, there's one for the whiteboard.

1260
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:40,220
I went once with my mom a couple months ago,

1261
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:44,220
and what happened was, well,

1262
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:48,220
I got sent. We were waiting in line,

1263
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:52,220
and the lady was, we had to wait 10 minutes, they were

1264
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:56,220
ignoring us, and we were at the front of the line at the counter,

1265
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:00,220
and then they had the nerve to ask,

1266
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:04,220
the nerve to ask, do you want to buy an edge cart with that, because you're 10% discount?

1267
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:08,220
My mom was like, no, and then we walked out. I mean,

1268
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:12,220
after making us wait 10 minutes, we could tell they were pretty much a little bit

1269
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:16,220
ignoring us, and you know, I know it's a bit busy, but

1270
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:20,220
I mean, it's just so annoying.

1271
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:24,220
So there's one for the game spot, stop, whatever

1272
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:28,220
message board thing. Sorry it was a little over a minute. Later.

1273
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:32,220
What's up, Orange Mouse Radio? This is Tigerclaw. I'd like to congratulate

1274
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:36,220
you all for the 300th episode. Keep up the good fight.

1275
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:40,220
Take care. Alright? Well, happy 300th!

1276
01:31:40,220 --> 01:31:44,220
Or as we say in French,

1277
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:48,220
30, 30! Oh well, hell. Anyway,

1278
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:52,220
hi there, O.L.R., this is SakiRipper just calling you to say

1279
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:56,220
happy 300!

1280
01:31:56,220 --> 01:32:00,220
300 after the arms jargon. That was Swedish.

1281
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,220
So, oh well, hell. You're us at a later date.

1282
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:09,020
Hello there, Orange Mouse Radio, this is DMN, co-host of Under

1283
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:13,020
Shadow, and host of the old DMN Sanity. Yee-haw!

1284
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:17,020
Anyways, I'm calling to congratulate you guys on 300 episodes.

1285
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:21,020
That is a fantastic match. You guys are amazing.

1286
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:25,020
I look forward to 300 more, and I know everyone else

1287
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:29,020
listening is, so congratulations once again on 300, and

1288
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,020
don't rob for too much, kids. Anyways, take care.

1289
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:39,020
If you didn't understand that, well, it's basically access to Mexico,

1290
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:43,020
your favorite neighborhood Mexican, and I want to

1291
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:47,020
congratulate Orange Mouse Radio for their 300th episode, so

1292
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:51,020
congrats, and keep up the good fight.

1293
01:32:51,020 --> 01:33:03,020
So, basically that, congratulations.

1294
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:09,020
300! 300! 300! 300!

1295
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:13,020
Excuse me, is it Rob? Hey, it's Misty.

1296
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,020
What? You know I was going to call you.

1297
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:21,020
Congrats on episode 300. You know, I heart you.

1298
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:25,020
I'll heart you guys forever. Bye.

1299
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:29,020
Hey, Orange is on Under Radio, it's CJ Tyrant. Just wanted to say congrats on

1300
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:33,020
300 episodes. That's amazing. Shout out to all the Be My Hands

1301
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:37,020
out there in the chat room. You guys rock. Keep playing Be My Games.

1302
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:41,020
Keep playing music games, though, too. And congrats to Rob from Game of Ph.D.

1303
01:33:41,020 --> 01:33:45,020
Off the hat, you. Anyways, congratulations.

1304
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:49,020
300 episodes so far, looking forward to the next 300.

1305
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:53,020
Have a good week, guys.

1306
01:33:53,020 --> 01:33:57,020
I'd like to wish you guys a good 300th episode

1307
01:33:57,020 --> 01:34:01,020
of OLR, so I will not be listening live tonight.

1308
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:05,020
I'm going to set out to actually play DDR in a few minutes, so I will

1309
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:09,020
try for today for a special AAA for you guys, so

1310
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:13,020
hopefully we look into a couple hundred more OLR episodes

1311
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:17,020
in the next couple of years before. And I'm going to be heading out, so peace out.

1312
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,020
And AAA for these jammer games. Hey guys, if you're listening to your listeners,

1313
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:25,020
CJ Tyrant, and I'm calling to tell you that Orange is on Under Radio is the A show

1314
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:29,020
when it comes to gaming projects. And I really don't understand how much this show does mean to us

1315
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:33,020
fans. 300 episodes, guys. Congratulations. Looking forward to more

1316
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:43,020
A show in 2009.

1317
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:47,020
Hey. Hey. What?

1318
01:34:47,020 --> 01:34:51,020
Did you like, um, did you upload

1319
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:55,020
the thing yet? I'm working on it right now, but before I get to

1320
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:59,020
upload it, there's one thing we gotta do first. What? We have to

1321
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:03,020
wish Orange is On's radio a happy 300. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely.

1322
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:07,020
So let's get it going. I'm DJ Ronn S. And I'm Kudo Osagie.

1323
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:07,020
And on behalf of the staff at Anime Jam

1324
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:15,020
which is me, Kudo, and Sailor Flair, we want to congratulate Rob,

1325
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:19,020
Jamie, and Loke, on an awesome 300 episode tonight.

1326
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:23,020
Oh my gosh, 300 episodes. What are you guys going to do now? Like go to Disney World?

1327
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:27,020
I hope not. They've already done Disney World. I know, it's so

1328
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:33,020
I know but um tonight, I'm gonna I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna have a drink based on each one of them

1329
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:39,000
So these are awesome funds tonight. You're gonna like totally plastered. I feel bad for you. I'm not gonna be fast

1330
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are

1331
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,780
Hey, what instead of arguing won't you come into the chat room tonight?

1332
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:52,060
Oh, it'll be fun

1333
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:58,960
So, um, Rob Matt Jamie have a great show tonight and you know, I'll be there and see you for episode real one

1334
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:02,160
Hey, so we're excited

1335
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,760
Just a little bit

1336
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:32,080
All right, awesome. Have a good show tonight. See you laters

1337
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:38,020
Welcome back everybody to episode number 300 of orange lounge radio in this Sunday evening, October the 26th

1338
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,400
2008 just a reminder. There will be no show next week

1339
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:42,980
I'm just due to the fact that hey

1340
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:49,480
We deserve a week off after 300 episodes and the fact that I'm having surgery and I'm being held up by Loki

1341
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:56,080
Dressed as sack boy, which you can see on our Justin TV feed at Justin TV slash orange lounge radio

1342
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:03,040
Right now he's holding up tipped gunny. Oh, he's holding up the Justin listeners with a gun. That's that's lovely. Where'd you get a gun?

1343
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,640
Okay, I'm like where the hell who got you a gun Rob I have airsoft guns, all right

1344
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,320
Pistols, all right

1345
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,560
Anyhow, I know we want to get to the skype line. We got a lot of people want to call in tonight

1346
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,200
We're gonna try as many calls as possible

1347
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,920
But first we got a little more news to get to and Loki you ready and situated there ready to get us back into some

1348
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:30,000
Gaming news. Yeah, of course. All righty. All right, so

1349
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:38,800
Starting things off as I kind of hinted to earlier pin aircade adventures episode 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PC

1350
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:40,880
on

1351
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,720
October 29th

1352
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,960
That's awesome news. No word on ps3 yet

1353
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:51,200
Probably just because they just finally got the first episode so give it a little bit more time

1354
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,800
but it will be $15 on both platforms and

1355
01:37:55,280 --> 01:38:00,360
Will be all sorts of awesome. So sweet. It better be based on that recommendation

1356
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:06,040
Well, it's supposed to be the first one was kind of fun. So we don't see why the second one would be as well

1357
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:10,080
Well one thing you might not be getting to do when you play this game online

1358
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:15,360
Even though you don't really play this game online, but other Xbox Live games would be you probably won't get to swear much longer

1359
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:22,880
Apparently the US patent office has granted a patent to Microsoft for real-time censoring of audio streams

1360
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,240
So, you know, this is pretty self-explanatory

1361
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:32,480
Probably what Microsoft wants as far as they want to be able to censor what Xbox Live is probably most known for

1362
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:38,080
Is the fuck fuck fuck fuck, you know and all that stuff that you hear when you go on Xbox Live, by the way

1363
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,080
They can't censor this show. Haha

1364
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,080
Fuck fuck fuck fuck

1365
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,080
You know what though

1366
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:50,680
You know what a writer on Ars Technica though Jonathan Gitlin though

1367
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:55,720
Brings up a really kind of scary point think about this because you know, this is the technology, right?

1368
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:59,120
I can also envisage a much sinister role

1369
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:05,400
However, imagine the same system applied to digital telephony then think how valuable such a system might be to an authoritarian

1370
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,320
authoritarian regime

1371
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,840
As we've seen to good effect in Burma and elsewhere the ubiquity of cell phones

1372
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,840
It's been a good thing for dissidents who need to get their message out or organize themselves

1373
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:18,520
The Great Firewall of China already blocks objectionable web content from reaching Chinese computers

1374
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:24,320
What's to stop cell phones from censoring anti-government conversations, too? That is kind of a scary thought

1375
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:27,440
Let's hope that this isn't used for you know, anything

1376
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,400
Pushing the limits I can imagine this is

1377
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:35,800
Gonna be a scary thing if it falls into the wrong hands. So Janai brings up an interesting point

1378
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,960
What's that in chat? Imagine censoring the angry video game nerd?

1379
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:45,960
Well, yeah still just anything it's a it kind of threatens free speech. His powers are beyond Microsoft's comprehension

1380
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:50,960
If indeed if in the wrong hands, I you know again in this country, you know, since free speech is in our Constitution

1381
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,920
I don't think it's gonna be a big problem. But you know, it could be interesting to see the effect

1382
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,800
This could have another place. I think the guy makes a good point

1383
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:00,360
What if it falls in the wrong hands, but also I can't imagine that this is going to be

1384
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:06,120
That accurate, you know what I mean? That'd be ways. Will it catch me if I say frack?

1385
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:13,280
The thing is with what if I'm talking about my shih tzu dog, am I gonna get censored thing is Rob about free speech rights

1386
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:17,400
Yeah, the government can't inhibit your free speech rights

1387
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:24,120
But companies sure can when you agree to play by their rules exactly as long as you've signed the agreement saying that you're going to use

1388
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:25,840
their

1389
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,840
proprietary, you know

1390
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:32,120
Software and I guess the hardware to since it's referring to the Xbox

1391
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:36,640
Then they do have a right to censor any content that comes through their own

1392
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,240
equipment it's just like a

1393
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,120
private

1394
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:47,680
Organization denying people the use of their facilities exactly. All right, I get that I get that but still I'm gonna be very disappointed

1395
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,180
Since I pay for Microsoft service if I can't say fuck

1396
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:56,560
However, knowing Microsoft and based on track history only I'm going to assume it'll probably be a switch little

1397
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,520
You know help keep it safe for kids, which I'm cool with, you know

1398
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,800
If parents want to turn it on but they shouldn't rely on it. That's the other dangerous thing

1399
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,640
I don't want parents to rely on it to see it like, you know, some of those TBS

1400
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,320
comedies where they replace it with like

1401
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,760
Stupid words just like ordinary thing like what a fruit

1402
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,760
French toast

1403
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,180
Shove it up your bologna. Yes, like

1404
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:28,380
Well or kazoo or be perfectly honest the whole reason that swear words are considered swear words in the beginning is

1405
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:32,820
Because people have given them the power to offend and what is it that I have been saying?

1406
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:37,060
For a very long time now you find this show very offensive

1407
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:42,000
Oh, whatever learn to be offended the less of a big deal you make out of it

1408
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,780
The less it's gonna matter. I mean really

1409
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:50,660
The whole reason that I think you know little kids think it's fun to go out and cuss from their little kids is because their

1410
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:55,820
Parents say oh, that's bad. You shouldn't do it the less you're allowed to do something the more y'all want to do it

1411
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:00,500
Exactly it people do that because people do that because it raises eyebrows

1412
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:02,740
Well, look folks

1413
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:08,860
No one gets offended. Why would they want to do it anymore? I would love to see Microsoft's and giggles

1414
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:27,180
Well, that's why I would love to see Microsoft just try and censor this next segment of ours

1415
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:29,180
The FUs of the week

1416
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:34,160
Fuck you with something hard and sandpaper II

1417
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:47,360
to a certain closed-minded tight-assed bigoted conservatives that have been

1418
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:55,440
Less than polite in regards to how they decide to phrase their personal points of view and

1419
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:02,320
F you to other things that are personal. All right

1420
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:06,760
Oh go and F you to my hair

1421
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,400
Loki F you the sack boy for being so fluffy cuz

1422
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:18,000
Fluffy equals hot you're kind of you're kind of fluffy Loki. I am couple that's why I didn't have to pad the front

1423
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,040
Yeah, no needing the pad myself. Well that and it's really friggin hot

1424
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:28,120
But actually luckily the sweatshirt is quite thin so it's not too bad

1425
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:33,440
I actually have like jeans under the pants and another t-shirt under this shirt

1426
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,840
so

1427
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:39,800
All right, but the heads really fucking hot can't can't do anything with the head my turn

1428
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:45,180
Yes, yay. I want to say F you to the people that decided to call me faggot yesterday

1429
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:49,680
Well, I was out protesting prop 8 we were out there on the streets holding signs

1430
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,060
You know, I had a big thing said, you know protect civil rights and all stuff

1431
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:59,680
there was a group of us out there and some guy as he drove by decided to yell faggots and throw candy corn at us cuz

1432
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:04,680
That's that's the world. We live in folks. No, I don't know whether to be angry or happy that no

1433
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:09,600
It's like it's like and one hand I'm offended by what you said in the other hand candy corn

1434
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:15,120
Not when they've fallen on the dirty-ass Street. I'm not oh, that's just not except that is I guess

1435
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:20,540
So not only did he say faggot Loki. He wasted candy corn and if you don't know

1436
01:44:20,540 --> 01:44:22,300
You don't waste time. I'm sorry

1437
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:29,660
Is is it wrong for me to mention that we're supposed to learn to stop throwing things and having food fight

1438
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,660
Yeah, when we're in kindergarten

1439
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:36,820
Yeah, and then oh, yeah, and then the lady as she was coming out of the drive-thru

1440
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:41,020
No, here's the best one the lady coming out the drive-thru faggots. You're all going to hell

1441
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:45,580
That's what she yelled at us. They should have thrown skittles. No, you know what I said, I yelled back

1442
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:51,580
I said God loves a bigot too. That's what I said back to her. Then she drove off pissed off good. So

1443
01:44:52,540 --> 01:44:56,580
You know and so don't sit there and tell me this proposition isn't about hate and discrimination

1444
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:00,940
Cuz I'll tell you what I've seen it right in the face and it is so yeah. All right

1445
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:05,060
Moving on some real quick F use from our guests because we have a lot in studio

1446
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:08,300
We'll start with Drew since he has a mic. All right F you to my student government for

1447
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:13,900
being assholes about the whole proposition thing agreed, I didn't vote him in and

1448
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:20,940
They're trying to speak for the entire student body and I don't like it one bit actually I did to go with this

1449
01:45:20,940 --> 01:45:25,900
I might have mentioned this earlier. There was a girl who was driving in front of me leaving school

1450
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:33,380
We forget the same school and she wrote on her car. No to prop eight. The ARC Student Council does not represent me. I

1451
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,860
approve of that

1452
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,060
but

1453
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:44,300
Also F you to people who are taking the zombie event in while a little too far and taking the hordes and hordes of zombies

1454
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:51,180
People taking Wow too far to the low B zones and killing all the low B's are trying to start out

1455
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:59,500
That's not cool. I mean, yeah, it's zombies and it's brains, but it's not cool. Don't be a dick

1456
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:03,480
All right, pick up boy. Do you have any F use of the week?

1457
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:06,800
I'm gonna send a nephew toward

1458
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:12,960
the bimbo of politicians everywhere and I don't even think I need to you know,

1459
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:16,560
Go any further with that because everybody should know who I'm talking about

1460
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:19,480
But so I shall pass the mic on

1461
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:24,560
Arcadian 42 fuck you to 65-hour work weeks. They suck

1462
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,600
put me behind like

1463
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,840
Way way behind on everything. But oh well give me money

1464
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:39,120
Good money is good. Doctor. Fuck you to expert on DDR because I look like a douche trying to do it nice

1465
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:44,100
And lastly Mel Chan anything you want to say free no fuck use for Mel Chan. All right

1466
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:54,600
All right, that's it for the F use of the week dark Sakura take us back to some gaming news and stuff happened the end

1467
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,360
Okay, it'd be soft

1468
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:01,720
as actually working on the latest I know game and

1469
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:06,160
Actually have had to push it back a little bit

1470
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:12,320
As well as one that they have literally called an as yet unannounced

1471
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:17,280
Franchise they were gonna release it to the 2008-2009

1472
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:24,520
Fiscal year, but it's actually going to be oh nine ten. We don't know what this is. But I know I'm 1404 is

1473
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:26,960
a

1474
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,880
settlement building game

1475
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,880
This speaks for itself

1476
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,960
There's there's a trailer around if someone wants to look at game trailers. I'm sure there's one there

1477
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:41,360
But the other one they're not saying what it is, but they said that it's an unannounced one. So

1478
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:44,280
Maybe it's a brand new franchise

1479
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:46,920
could be

1480
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,160
Hmm

1481
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,920
well

1482
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:55,720
Something unfortunately hasn't been delayed is an update to the Wii firmware. That's now

1483
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:59,120
disabling the homebrew channel from being installed

1484
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,720
other possible

1485
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:04,040
problems faced with that are some

1486
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,840
homebrew programs not running also

1487
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:09,680
the

1488
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:16,240
video player that they had that also allowed you to watch DVDs is not working as well the end player and

1489
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:23,280
Right now though if you do have the homebrew channel installed you're fine, but you won't be able to install it if you

1490
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:25,280
You know do

1491
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,800
3.3 also in Japan

1492
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:35,840
They have the shop channel down right now for maintenance as they're changing all the references to Wii points to Nintendo points and other

1493
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:42,760
Pre-dsi maintenance is that a little deceiving though because the points aren't going to be interchangeable that strikes me as kind of dumb it is

1494
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,240
deceiving yes

1495
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,960
And then also apparently right now

1496
01:48:47,960 --> 01:48:53,360
If you don't update your system you will not be able to access the shop channel

1497
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:58,480
Which is ironic because if you think about it if they're not able to access the shop channel

1498
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:01,000
They won't buy your crap that you're selling online

1499
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:05,480
And you know with the homebrew stuff that it is easy to I don't know

1500
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,760
Pirate said games that you're offering on the service

1501
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:14,000
I would think that you would want to allow people to be able to purchase your games and let them have fun with the homebrew

1502
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,800
stuff since

1503
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,600
likely

1504
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:24,800
Situation is is that they're actually not pirating games using that they're just you know playing with these home brew people

1505
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:27,280
jobs I

1506
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:31,080
Don't think they need jobs. It's just if there's something offered to them for free

1507
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:35,840
They're gonna take the free route then rather than pay for a game that might be crap and unfortunately

1508
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:38,160
There's a lot of might be crap games on the Wii

1509
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:44,800
Um kloutipo in chat says so do the people who have to try and close all these homebrew exploits

1510
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:50,080
Just completely and utterly hate their jobs. I see so no way someone could take pleasure from that well

1511
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:56,720
I I can see the other side though. You know people stealing other people's work by pirating such games

1512
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:02,240
Don't lie. This is what a lot of the quote-unquote homebrew people do I can see both sides of it, though?

1513
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:08,560
All right well um I guess maybe I should hurry up and install that before my Wii updates itself because I haven't updated it yet

1514
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,240
So maybe I should get that homebrew channel on there

1515
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:15,320
I don't know is it is it gonna screw me over later if I put it on there now no you can always delete it

1516
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:20,200
It's not like you're gonna buy anything on the Wii shop channel Rob. Well. I don't know this this might do the trick

1517
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:26,440
It's something new that was announced this week. It's Mart racer. Do you remember the old-school game show supermarket sweep?

1518
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:31,640
Dude, that's this the greatest ever that's this look. There's a little trailer here. We're playing in studio

1519
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:35,400
It's yeah

1520
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:41,400
Lifetime lawnmowers unpacked, but look at this you actually run around a supermarket with your cart

1521
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:47,000
And you but you pick up plungers for some weird reason, but if you run into other shoppers

1522
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:51,000
But yeah like it's everything you've always wanted to do in the supermarket

1523
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,760
They're all kind of crazy out of eight characters, so there you have it. It's like it's gonna rock suit meets

1524
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:04,040
Jet-set radio or something like that by the way according to Juan grill who is the studio manager for the developers Joju games?

1525
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:07,160
He says that Mart racer was inspired from the shape of the wiimote

1526
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,080
He says quote the first time I grabbed a wiimote instinctively

1527
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,720
I grabbed it with both hands like a bar that made me start thinking on a game where you can maneuver it like you would

1528
01:51:14,720 --> 01:50:52,000
Be grabbing a

1529
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:20,480
So that is how we came to the game as a Mat

1530
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:23,720
would be grabbing a bar so there you go and if you want to play with a classic

1531
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:27,460
controller you can but I guess it's probably more fun with motion controls

1532
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:30,860
because you can imagine that you're pushing that cart just like a bat out of

1533
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:35,700
hell up and down the aisles of Safeway it'll be lots of fun you know I wonder

1534
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:39,340
because people are always afraid about you know real life taking after video

1535
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:42,920
games I wonder if this is gonna cause an epidemic of like you know people running

1536
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:47,300
around supermarkets like crazy let's go on a milkshake run as if this milkshake

1537
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:51,260
as if this game get more stuff for milkshakes as if this game will sell that

1538
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:54,640
many copies although I don't know it sounds pretty awesome to me I might

1539
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:58,000
actually I might break my protest just for Mart racer because it looks that

1540
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,440
awesome anyhow what are some other things you can download our sagra well

1541
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:11,480
there is a few games coming out on we were in the UK there are there's the

1542
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:18,240
incredible maze which is a 500 we points and it's different it's mazes and has

1543
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:23,320
balance board support so you actually steer a ball around the maze and dodge

1544
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:26,960
traps basically it's marble madness with the balance board from what I understand

1545
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:32,240
there's also interior design and well an interior design game sorry called home

1546
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:41,200
sweet home that is you basically take rooms and redesign them sort of like a

1547
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:46,200
bizarre puzzle and it's a thousand we points and then there's Tetris party

1548
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:52,280
which is 1200 we points that is minigame Tetris using the balance board and it

1549
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:57,200
has online multiplayer for up to six people yeah but how many times have I

1550
01:52:57,200 --> 01:53:06,760
played Tetris really what just remember the epic battle with Christopher thank

1551
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:11,840
you kept yelling at us again for Tetris on the DS Oh God he was a scary

1552
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:16,640
motherfucker on Tetris on the DS I remember that that was some scary stuff

1553
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:26,080
yeah thanks for the memories alright anyhow I'm sorry yes so other than stuff

1554
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:30,720
coming on to the WiiWare service there's some interesting stuff if you happen to

1555
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:38,440
own a Super Nintendo system apparently a German programmer took upon himself to

1556
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:43,960
create a new console game that supports eight players his creation is a brawler

1557
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:50,960
called n warp die sukent or it looks like a yeah die sakusen and allows you

1558
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:57,600
to plug in two multi taps in the one and our SNES and yeah it's pretty awesome

1559
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:02,640
but you can also if you don't want to I don't know say find a cart for it since

1560
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:05,440
it doesn't look like there is an actual cart you can play it through an emulator

1561
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:13,320
but I don't know that's pretty awesome eight player brawler game for Super

1562
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:17,600
Nintendo if you want to download it the website is gra dot d force three

1563
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:25,200
thousand dot de so that's where you can get that wonderful game all right well

1694

1698
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:30,960
already have a little big planet yeah fallout 3 hopefully this week yeah I

1699
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:33,560
want to play a lot of little big planet while I'm recovering from surgery that's

1700
02:06:33,560 --> 02:06:41,200
the plan it'll be fun to play while you're on drugs yes that's I'm sorry

1701
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:44,920
I'm also looking forward to last remnant though even though I was not a fan of

1702
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:49,760
infinite undiscovery I thought that I thought that it does the beginning was

1703
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:54,080
awful like it didn't want me I didn't want to play it past the first hour in

1704
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:58,400
comparison to blue dragon even blue dragon I played for at least like the

1705
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:03,920
first disc but the best was lost Odyssey by waste of time I swear lost us he was

1706
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:07,640
the best by far that's that's it for email though all right mailbag orange

1707
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:11,920
launch radio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week meanwhile

1708
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:20,800
more news Loki yes anyways so of course we know about the new game coming out

1709
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:27,520
halo recon or halo 3 recon apparently though bungees halo team is moving on to

1710
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:34,560
other things once this is done so I don't know maybe another game from bungee

1711
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:43,040
that's say not halo maybe a I don't know marathon game something like that a low

1712
02:07:43,040 --> 02:07:50,840
may low marathon oh haven't they said this before like oh we swear we're not

1713
02:07:50,840 --> 02:07:55,520
doing this before like after halo 3 but you know it says basically they were

1714
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:59,680
saying that they want to work on different territory and they said but I

1715
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,160
think when this project wraps up in a couple months that it will be time for

1716
02:08:04,160 --> 02:08:09,200
when the team moves on to something else and part of the team will move on

1717
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,800
something else and part of them will probably be absorbed into one of the

1718
02:08:11,800 --> 02:08:15,880
other projects that are already on the way I like what a deep man suggests in

1719
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:26,080
the chat room a game called j-lo get it tips it say you know we need forget it

1720
02:08:26,080 --> 02:08:30,840
hey you know how the PlayStation 3 has trophies well according to the u.s.

1721
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:34,560
official PlayStation magazine Sony might actually be giving out more than just

1722
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,240
trophies pretty soon it's a little quote from the magazine that people were

1723
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:41,240
reading way too much into it says quote we've heard that SCA is mulling over

1724
02:08:41,240 --> 02:08:45,080
some sort of trophy reward system we doubt it'll be cash to the equivalent

1725
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:48,720
but we suspect it might be exclusive access to early betas and the like so

1726
02:08:48,720 --> 02:08:53,280
you know trophies are like PlayStation 3's version of 360s achievements

1727
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:57,400
wouldn't that be interesting if suddenly you could use your trophies to now get

1728
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:01,000
into betas and stuff I think Microsoft should do the same thing because I play

1729
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:06,040
a lot more Microsoft games and well you know and and I agree with the people that

1730
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:10,840
wrote this story on the net I got no problem if it's early demos or what have

1731
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:15,120
you but just to give exclusive that seems kind of wrong to me just

1732
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:18,480
encourages people to do nothing but play games all day but then again this whole

1733
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:22,440
thing whole world is something retarded what is your what here's the words doing

1734
02:09:22,440 --> 02:09:26,320
you know where for example if you have different achievements and Gears of War

1735
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:31,280
that you get shit for Gears of War 2 could it be something like that that

1736
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:34,720
makes you know I beat you know a little big planet when little big planet 2

1737
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:40,320
comes out or something like that I get some stupid costume or something that

1738
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:45,600
works that works yeah all right well we'll see what happens maybe more to

1739
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:54,880
come from Sony probably in 2009 I doubt that Sony's gonna explode the end it

1740
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:58,600
already exploded it puked out something called Star Wars galaxies black wolf

1741
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:02,000
has a good point I got to read this in chat okay sky what's better giving

1742
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,560
exclusive betas to people who have lots of trophies or giving exclusive betas to

1743
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:10,720
people who buy core I'll take option three giving exclusive betas to me here

1744
02:10:10,720 --> 02:10:16,200
that's the best of me anyway in other words the fanboys will never be happy

1745
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:27,400
well there is a a boy named Brandon crisp 50 15 years old who went missing

1746
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:35,560
after his parents confiscated his Xbox there is a Microsoft Canada is adding

1747
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:42,000
$25,000 to the reward information that will you know hopefully lead to his safe

1748
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,480
return so they're basically doubling the amount that's already out they're

1749
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:52,440
working with the Barrie Ontario authorities looking for IP addresses of

1750
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:56,360
anyone who had come into contact with him through Call of Duty 4 which was his

1751
02:10:56,360 --> 02:11:04,160
favorite game and Microsoft is really really putting forward a lot of effort

1752
02:11:04,160 --> 02:11:14,280
into trying to get this kid back so basically the oh god I hate this person

1753
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:20,960
how is it Microsoft's problem he who shall not be named has involved himself

1754
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:30,920
what the fuck I thought he was gone let me finish making an offer to the to help

1755
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:36,040
the cops try to find it and and making up some crap about a video game

1756
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:39,760
addiction or whatever the fuck he's on

1757
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:45,720
I'm so disgusted with him what the fuck so now they got this bar he's gonna what

1759
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:52,160
it the people that are supposed to threaten to move to Canada are the

1760
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:56,280
Liberals that are afraid that you know it's like push gets reelected just I

can't even call him a human being anymore really it's he's just a part

1764
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:18,080
I think he's a part at any rate for anyone who might have some information

1765
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:24,200
on his whereabouts call the Berry police at seven oh five seven two five seven

punished for it and asshole hasn't learned his lesson yet I mean seriously

1773
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:12,480

1811
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:13,960
your mind I got around to playing the new Castlevania this week which I'm

1812
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:19,000
surprised he didn't mention on last week's release dates did oh did you know

1813
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:23,280
didn't we get mentioned at the end here we did I think we did keep the podcast

1814
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:26,480
is a little behind so make sure you have the most current episode oh I don't

1815
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:31,080
walk us I'm not down in the podcast oh well you I think it got mentioned but

1816
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:36,080
anyway okay so I haven't played it yet I want to what do you think of the game

1817
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:41,920
it's it's like the other DS Castlevania is more or less well I like those like

1818
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:48,880
how they have like a lot of new areas now it's like one big area how does it

1819
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:53,200
compare to previous Castlevania games like well like the maps for example

1820
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:57,240
they're smaller now but there's like there's like more enemies so it's more

1821
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:01,440
difficult and like you'll usually be so busy funny anyways that you'll hardly

1822
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:05,160
notice that the amount of small especially cuz like for this game I

1823
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:09,920
don't use I hardly use the map like I usually have the second screen for like

1824
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:17,840
checking enemies and stuff hmm do we have any really bad beat movie dialogue

1825
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:23,720
in the game um yeah the English voice acting kind of sucks and there's a

1826
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:28,360
Japanese language option but for me doesn't make it any better always make

1827
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:35,000
it into a language that I'm not very fluent in yet hmm all right well do you

1828
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:40,400
recommend it to fans of Castlevania yeah I've been that doesn't sound like a very

1829
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:47,880
solid yes kind of like a yeah I guess I mean you have nothing better to do I

1830
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:52,160
guess you could do it and if it if you're looking for a game that's like

1831
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:57,040
more action oriented and like exploration oriented and this is a

1832
02:17:57,040 --> 02:18:03,160
pretty good game to try out all right sounds good anything else you want to

1856
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:21,120
much when it comes to Bon Jovi living on a prayer guitar hero world tour is a lot

02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:36,800
really worried like not even rock revolution did that well we're gonna get

1874
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:40,840
radio who's this hello there orange lounge this is a character hello my

1875
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:48,240
friend how are you I'm doing just fine I'm well what I call well I was quite

1876
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:56,960
surprised that at last the downloadable pack this week for rock band in in the

1877
02:21:56,960 --> 02:22:02,520
sense that it was a few sushi and banshee songs we're really the we're

1878
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:08,760
really like my we my best best news of the week actually yes I know I'm very

1879
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:13,040
excited about that just it's nice to see a nice eclectic mix of music and rock

1880
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:21,960
band my problem is though that that all of the three songs that are there that

1881
02:22:21,960 --> 02:22:29,160
are there only one of them is good actually yeah they are to be picky

1882
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:32,600
there's no peek-a-boo or anything which would be rad but I can't imagine

1883
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:36,840
actually playing that song in rock band that's the thing yeah well babe but that

1884
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:40,840
and that you mentioning peek-a-boo is like in one way if you know if you know

1885
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:45,400
the history behind that song you know that it will be quite hard in one way

1886
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:53,320
since the whole song is played backwards so it's right since they have to learn

1887
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:57,880
how to play it all back what would be a fun challenge mode though there's notes

1888
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:04,600
can scroll the opposite way well it'll be fun yeah what else is going on your

1889
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:12,760
gaming world this week not much actually not much at all I'm it's a bit it's

1890
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:17,920
really a sad thing in one way since well I bought Warhammer online so when it

1891
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:25,040
came out and well I have it I have played it like the number of times I

1892
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:29,560
have actually played it I can count it on one hand Wow me too I'm in the exact

1893
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:34,360
same boat you are and and then and then I started thinking in one way actually

1894
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:41,720
since since I was it was a I check actually I didn't check out Wow went

1895
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:50,560
back to Wow actually but I did see the new logins frequents the login login

1896
02:23:50,560 --> 02:24:01,560
screen and that actually made me go we who big frost worm yeah it's got

1897
02:24:01,560 --> 02:24:05,960
mushroomed well we just had a flying mushroom behave boys and girls in studio

1898
02:24:05,960 --> 02:24:15,200
sorry our guests are getting unruly all right sorry ahem we're a little

1900
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:25,760
well other than that well I'm sorry I'm starting to get sort of in one way

1901
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:31,100
pissed also since at the current state I have no TV whatsoever oh my god which

1902
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:38,200
yeah yeah but then again but but and that's starting to annoy me really since

1903
02:24:38,200 --> 02:24:43,480
I want to play on my retro cut I want to I'm sort of almost really utterly want

1904

02:26:57,320 --> 02:27:03,440
well the other week I went to Tokyo game show which was really exciting tell us

1925
02:27:03,440 --> 02:27:07,800
about that how was Tokyo game show what kind of stuff did you see there oh it

1926
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:13,760
was huge very exciting tons of people the biggest booth is probably Xbox 360

1927
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:20,240
do you think Xbox 360 is going to turn around in Japan I believe so I mean they

1928
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:25,520
had a pretty big booth and tons of people waiting in line they had 105

1929
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:33,640
minute wait for one game Wow what game was that I think it was the last remnant

1930
02:27:33,640 --> 02:27:37,760
mmm I'm kind of not surprised at that yeah because that would be the game that

1931
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:43,160
is supposed to like kind of cater to the Japanese audience wow that's why e3

1932
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:48,040
can't go public you guys 105 minute waits just to play like one RPG imagine

1933
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:50,800
what those Wii U lines would have looked like if it was open to the public of the

1934
02:27:50,800 --> 02:27:58,400
nut so anyway Wow well I'm glad I'm glad you're having a good time

1935
02:27:58,400 --> 02:28:03,760
I want to talk about called time hollow okay and it is a Japanese game but it

1936
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:07,840
was just released in the States and it is amazing if you ever heard of shadow

1937
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:13,000
of destiny's for the PlayStation 1 it's much like that game in which you have to

1938
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,080
change the past and then it causes something else to change which you got

1939
02:28:16,080 --> 02:28:21,880
to go back and change again and it has real anime videos throughout the whole

1940
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:26,440
game I loved it so it sounds kind of like a puzzle game but with anime

1941
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:34,920
cutscenes not a puzzle game it's an adventure game interesting oh Mel chance

1942
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:41,920
Mel chance calling it butterfly effect the game yes okay that's kind of cool

1943
02:28:41,920 --> 02:28:45,520
okay all right I might have to check that out you know there's a lot of these

1944
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:49,400
games that really don't show up on the radar like that that I wish would get

1945
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:53,520
more coverage so I know to look out for them yeah I was drooling over it for a

1946
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:58,200
while in the Japanese stores here Toys R Us and different local stores and

1947
02:28:58,200 --> 02:29:03,880
then all of a sudden I see it at the store on base I'm like grab there you go

1962
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:20,240

1963
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:26,200
okay well cool well what what games did you get for 360

1964
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:32,780
main one was portal still alive I caved and downloaded beaten groovy for the

1965
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:37,600
fuck of it I know it there's something about being a bimani fan at heart where

1966
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:41,240
you have to give beaten groovy a try it's like rock revolution like that's

1967
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:44,200
why I keep saying like God I really want to get rock revolution just because I

1968
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:47,880
feel like I know it's really not worth it I know I know I have not downloaded

1969
02:30:47,880 --> 02:30:51,160
beaten groovy if you play that game you're just encouraging them make crap

1970
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:55,320
I know I know same with beaten groovy it's like seriously what have they I

1971
02:30:55,320 --> 02:31:03,360
mean what was so what the fuck it does have a couple good songs in it but it

1972
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:09,160
the price tag sucks the price tag sucks it only has a couple songs in it all

1973
02:31:09,160 --> 02:31:14,000
right gs68 says is it even worse than worse than Yaris I would actually say

1974
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:17,640
no beaten groovy at least has star mine and shit it's not worse than yours but

1975
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:24,500
it's better than crisis shut up all right any games coming out for 360 that

1976
02:31:24,500 --> 02:31:31,480
you're looking forward to misty I admit I haven't been paying too much I've been

1992
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:53,640

1993
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:57,320
always let us call into your show but we're never you're never on ours what's

1994
02:32:57,320 --> 02:33:01,400
on your mind Bobby well no I was just coming it calling in to congratulate you

1995
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:05,480
on 300 and you know kind of a question for you guys about your show well thank

1996
02:33:05,480 --> 02:33:12,360
you where do you see you yourself at episode 400 canceled no I somebody had

1997
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:17,000
to say it where do we see ourselves at episode 400 um good question I'll let

1998
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:24,920
Loki start probably not much different than it is now I mean as the show

1999
02:33:24,920 --> 02:33:28,120
fundamentally changed that much as one well I guess in a way yes it has only

2000
02:33:28,120 --> 02:33:31,920
talking like two years I mean seriously I mean it's since episode one we did

2001
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:37,580
change from a you know show about DDR that was very random sometimes I mean my

2002
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:42,840
god we're talking about the next systems I think honestly in two years it'll be

2003
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:46,880
kind of about the next round of systems I think we'll try to do our best to

2004
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:51,440
maintain to stay on the cutting edge of interactive tools I think you will see

2005
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:55,560
Orange Launch Radio getting into video more in two years not necessarily that

2006
02:33:55,560 --> 02:33:59,960
we're gonna be hell we will not in the way you think like not necessarily it'll

2007
02:33:59,960 --> 02:34:04,920
be our mugs reading the news like it'll be fairies but maybe kind of the shut up

2008
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:10,800
maybe the way like folks interact with us I think will be different I I just

2009
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:14,220
you know cuz you know we were one of the first shows to really jump on skype when

2010
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:18,240
that first came out and you know just in TV we weren't really the first but you

2011
02:34:18,240 --> 02:34:21,800
know that was a way to kind of expand through that and you know we like to try

2012
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:25,000
to stay on the cutting edge of how to stay interactive with the listeners so

2013
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:29,160
you know I it's it's hard to think of what hasn't been done yet

2014
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:36,320
I don't know does that Sackboy costume have like fur on it does that gun is a

2015
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:40,320
furry for you no it's not it's I don't know what is it's stuff it's like

2016
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:44,320
sweatshirt material it's like a giant sweatshirt is what it is it's not furry

2017
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:50,120
though so and no tingle hat on it no table at this time but we figured this

2018
02:34:50,120 --> 02:34:52,780
is the closest the listeners are ever gonna get to seeing Loki in a tingle

2019
02:34:52,780 --> 02:34:58,240
outfit so you gotta you gotta take take what you can no because from what I can

2020
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:03,000
understand Loki likes Sackboy so it's not as fun to see him dressed up as that

2021
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:07,420
is it would be to see him dressed up as tingle but it's still adorable well I

2022
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:11,440
can't help it someone hasn't sold another 800,000 copies of something you

2023
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:15,220
know we're working on it well we're friends forever we're putting

2024
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:19,960
billboards up for it so and we're given I'm sorry I have I have a PlayStation

2025
02:35:19,960 --> 02:35:23,800
3 now so I can add Loki to my friends list so you don't have to be Loki's only

2026
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:28,000
friend anymore but I have more than one friend now you know yeah he dumped me as

2027
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:31,200
his only friend oh there are some other people that actually had a little bit

2028
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,640
planned already they were playing it not that I could play at them because the

2029
02:35:33,640 --> 02:35:37,000
servers aren't up yet till tomorrow they're gonna be up tomorrow fuck yeah

2030
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:44,520
so yeah can't wait so hey Bobby now that you're on the r-rated show is there

2031
02:35:44,520 --> 02:35:47,320
anything you want to say about guitar hero world tour you didn't get to say

2032
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:53,080
on your show well I see yeah when you added that I didn't get to say on my

2033
02:35:53,080 --> 02:36:00,560
show that kind of cut it out oh yeah the drums fucking suck and maybe next time

2034
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:05,440
Activision really should kind of look at their own equipment before they badmouth

2035
02:36:05,440 --> 02:36:09,880
the other ones and say hey when dearest breaks you can come by ours cuz it won't

2036
02:36:09,880 --> 02:36:15,400
break yeah I got I got a break because it's already broken have you thought

2037
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:21,120
about checking out rock revolutions drum set just to see if it's better well I

2038
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:24,840
don't think it's out yet actually oh my gosh even though the game's out the game

2039
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:28,640
is out the drum sets not out until November because apparently they haven't

2040
02:36:28,640 --> 02:36:33,940
quite figured out the manufacturing of that either and I've played on the drum

2041
02:36:33,940 --> 02:36:40,360
kit and a couple times but no the actual drum sets not in stores yet it's just

2042
02:36:40,360 --> 02:36:44,400
the game what I want to know is the drums weren't I mean I don't think I

2043
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:48,200
didn't get to play it but it didn't seem that the drums were broken when they

2044
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:53,360
were showing it off what happened I mean seriously mass production I guess yeah

2045
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:59,880
you know when they're take you know taking stuff like that to a convention

2046
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:05,280
they a test it and make sure they only bring the units that work and you know

2047
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:09,360
B when a unit breaks they have a replacement or they just closed down

2048
02:37:09,360 --> 02:37:12,760
that station I remember when rock band was first shown at the packs that you

2049
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:17,080
guys weren't at the year before they started out with like three drum sets

2050
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:21,600
and they had one by the end of the year by the end of the weekend and you could

2051
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:25,200
actually see the other drum sets all like bandaged up in the corner of the

2052
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:32,280
booth it was the sad depressed broken machines and I had Dan Teasdale on on I

2053
02:37:32,280 --> 02:37:36,000
was doing an interview with him for my show from the booth and I asked him

2054
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:39,160
about you know the durability of the drum sets and while I was asking the

2055
02:37:39,160 --> 02:37:42,600
question I looked at the pile of depressed drum sets and he didn't take

2056
02:37:42,600 --> 02:37:46,880
the bait interesting well it is amazing how those guys talk sometimes they

2057
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:50,960
surprised another review so far of said anything about the drum sets breaking I

2058
02:37:50,960 --> 02:37:54,440
don't mean there is a thread on Kotaku and stuff that they're talking about

2059
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:57,640
like a game facts forum thread or something like that that people were

2060
02:37:57,640 --> 02:38:01,760
saying hey you know we're posted for your drum sets work or not and there's

2061
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:05,160
people having problems with guitars having problems with the drum sets I

2062
02:38:05,160 --> 02:38:10,500
mean just a lot of them I have not seen a single post from anybody that says my

2063
02:38:10,500 --> 02:38:15,840
drums work perfectly that's not to say that there's none that aren't effective

2064
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:20,800
but I just either they're too busy playing the game or they just don't post

2065
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:28,400
on forums or whatever everybody has some sort of problem with the drums Wow well

2066
02:38:28,400 --> 02:38:32,920
I mean yeah I guess it's a good thing I don't buy these games for the drum parts

2067
02:38:32,920 --> 02:38:36,000
because I'm just not good at drum so I always buy them for guitars but still

2068
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,280
you know if I ever was interested in doing it someday that's kind of

2069
02:38:38,280 --> 02:38:43,920
depressing I don't know yeah and I mean I guess now I've got to do the whole RMA

2070
02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:48,320
process but I'm kind of worried you know have they fixed it yet because some of

2071
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:51,040
these threads you know I've looked on the official guitar hero forums which I

2072
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:55,180
know are mostly negative because the people only post there when they're

2073
02:38:55,180 --> 02:39:00,520
pissed or can't play true but they've said you know one guy said I've returned

2074
02:39:00,520 --> 02:39:05,360
it three times my store has no more every single drum set that I've gotten

2075
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:10,200
from the store has a different pad that's broken dang like they can't get

2076
02:39:10,200 --> 02:39:14,320
one that has all five pads that work maybe they rushed it maybe they just

2077
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:17,200
rushed it I think that's really what it is they just didn't take the time to get

2078
02:39:17,200 --> 02:39:20,680
it right and you want to know what's funny is if you go to Activision's now

2079
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:24,440
this is something I didn't say on my show if you go to Activision's support

2080
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:29,120
site and you look at the question you know why are my pads not working one of

2081
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:34,160
the things that actually says is you may need to hit it harder or softer these

2082
02:39:34,160 --> 02:39:40,640
drums react differently than other drum games you may have played so they kind

2083
02:39:40,640 --> 02:39:44,520
of insinuate that it's harmonics is fault that you're trying to play guitar

2084
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:52,120
hero in a specific way in a way that works huh because it's weird because

2085
02:39:52,120 --> 02:39:57,680
ordinary drums they just seem to make noise whenever I hit them yeah you know

2086
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:01,080
Bobby and it's just it's kind of funny coming from you because I know you're

2087
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:05,480
essentially a professional drummer and you know it's just kind of funny that

2088
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:10,520
she a professional drummer isn't playing the drums right apparently yeah and I

2089
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:14,360
mean it's you have to smack it really hard for it to register and they say

2090
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:18,360
well you may need to hit a pad harder or you may need to hit them softer and I'm

2091
02:40:18,360 --> 02:40:24,040
like not in that sense you shouldn't have to hit the right pad three times as

2092
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:29,280
hard as the middle pad and stuff and I mean I I even plugged in my professional

2093
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:33,920
drum kit which I've been passing around photos and oh man that little bit of

2094
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:37,360
problem on you have to post that photo in chat because it's hilarious seeing

2095
02:40:37,360 --> 02:40:41,080
all your equipment just like practically on top of each other I want to ask you

2096
02:40:41,080 --> 02:40:44,400
though real quick um what about the guitar with the game because for those

2097
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:47,280
of us that aren't so much into drums or guitars have you have you played around

2098
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:50,920
with that at all I play around a little bit with the guitar and I am happy to

2099
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:55,920
report that my guitar looks like it has absolutely no problem now that being

2100
02:40:55,920 --> 02:41:01,760
said I don't really understand the point of that slider thing the tutorial shows

2101
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:05,760
you how to use it and it doesn't work all the time but I think it's because

2102
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:10,480
I'm doing it wrong not because the hardware sucks but it's kind of like the

2103
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:17,280
lower fret notes in in rock band I'll never use it yeah you know that there's

2104
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:21,760
things that you can do with it now one of the things is that is your wah wah so

2105
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:26,440
instead of using the whammy bar for for things that maybe you don't have star

2106
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:29,600
power you can actually run your hand along that and it does the wah wah thing

2107
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:32,720
which is kind of cool and I know weird times just for the novelty factor huh

2108
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:40,120
but the guitar feels fine and they actually did add one of the one of the

2109
02:41:40,120 --> 02:41:43,600
actual software things for people that didn't buy the guitar that they added to

2110
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:48,360
get world tour is that now you can have like one note held down and then you can

2111
02:41:48,360 --> 02:41:52,200
strum down a second note and a third note so they'll do chords that kind of

2112
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:56,120
come on like that they're not hammer-ons but you still have to keep one note held

2113
02:41:56,120 --> 02:42:01,440
down while you bring the second one in interesting huh well I'm still using a

2114
02:42:01,440 --> 02:42:05,800
guitar hero to explore in all my games that's the only controller I have so

2115
02:42:05,800 --> 02:42:11,400
it's time for me to get a new one so be interesting and other than that you

2116
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:14,520
know people are asking how's the actual game I've been spending most of the day

2117
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:18,480
trying to get the game to work so I haven't really gotten too far name

2118
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:22,000
although I will say that apparently the storyline behind the game according to

2119
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:26,600
the intro screen is Kenny G comes out and hypnotizes everybody and it's your

2120
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:32,720
job to un-hypnotize everybody wow that's such a guitar hero story I hope that's

2121
02:42:32,720 --> 02:42:37,600
fake I mean cuz that's oh that's the opening cinematic is yet like a guy with

2122
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:42,080
a clarinet comes out and hypnotizes the entire crowd and so the gh symbol

2123
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:45,800
flashes on everybody's cell phone and watch and stuff and they all converge

2124
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:50,160
well un-hypnotize the crowd well aren't they gonna feel stupid when they release

2125
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:56,920
clarinet hero later on all right Bobby we gotta let you go so we can wrap our

2126

2135
02:43:35,840 --> 02:43:37,800
last Loki do you have any last minute actually

02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:42,400
dark Sakura anything no Loki then I just real quick there was a little big

2137
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:48,920
planet download that was added into for Japan you know that game ape escape well

2138
02:43:48,920 --> 02:43:54,280
now you can download a costume for your sack boy that's actually the ape in the

2139
02:43:54,280 --> 02:43:59,840
game which is kind of funny also army of two is supposed to be getting a movie as

2140
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:02,840
well you know it's funny we hear a lot of these movies that are coming out but

2141
02:44:02,840 --> 02:44:06,840
none of them come out except for like math max Payne I guess they're all next

2142
02:44:06,840 --> 02:44:12,920
year it's all talk until it actually happens all right so that's it I guess

2143
02:44:12,920 --> 02:44:16,600
for last minute stories are at one other quick little dedication here

2144
02:44:16,600 --> 02:44:19,200
drunami wants to do and then we're gonna go around and get final thoughts tonight

2145
02:44:19,200 --> 02:44:23,800
a little bit of sad news for the wild players that remember the forums

2146
02:44:23,800 --> 02:44:30,840
remember Ezra Chatterton he was contacted by the make-a-wish foundation

2147
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:35,360
because he had a brain tumor and talked to Blizzard and had some things

2148
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:41,920
customized for him had a few weapons dedicated to him had an entire tire few

2149
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:48,640
characters and quest lines in his honor passed away on Monday October 20th from

2150
02:44:48,640 --> 02:44:57,840
a stroke and our thoughts are with them well that's very unfortunate and you

2151
02:44:57,840 --> 02:45:01,480
know I know there was a lot of people that actually went in and did the will

2152
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:05,200
you find my dog quest that day just kind of like to because that was his quest

2153
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:08,520
and his voice is still in the game so it's very interesting that you know

2154
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:13,040
despite you know what's happened in offline he kind of will continue to

2155
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:17,560
live on online which is really neat which is something only a video game

2156
02:45:17,560 --> 02:45:23,560
could do so I know that is a very sad note to end episode 300 with so can

2157
02:45:23,560 --> 02:45:29,720
somebody make a fart joke or something to bring us back Rob what dongle princess

doing another show before Election Day please please please vote and please

2177
02:47:16,360 --> 02:47:20,800
please please if you're in California vote no on prop 8 and then if you do

2178
02:47:20,800 --> 02:47:24,760
you'll never have to hear me talk about it again and I also believe you should

2179
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:29,180
vote no on for hell I'd give you my entire political opinions it's the one

2180
02:47:29,180 --> 02:47:34,760
about parental notification but yeah yeah vote yes for the monorail no one

2181
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:41,280
damn near everything except the monorail look I honestly land even the

2182
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:44,360
presidential election pales in comparison to what rights are in store

2183
02:47:44,360 --> 02:47:47,280
with prop 8 but that obviously I'm a little biased you can probably

2184
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:53,520
understand why anyhow dark soccer your final thought reject false icons well
