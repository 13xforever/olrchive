1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:00,969
[SPEAKER_19]: Votants!

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,592
[SPEAKER_19]: Ready your breakfast and eat hearty.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,956
[SPEAKER_19]: For tonight, we dine in hell!

4
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:34,649
[SPEAKER_26]: 2008, E3 as we remember it is coming back, has PlayStation Home been hacked, and zombies are invading some of our favorite games.

5
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:47,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's episode number 300 here in studio.

6
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:48,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you believe it?

7
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's just a crap ton of people here in house.

8
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:52,739
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.

9
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:57,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the neighbors are going to call thinking that we're getting broken into or raped or something.

10
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:57,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Orgy!

11
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:58,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Orgy!

12
00:00:58,244 --> 00:00:58,685
[SPEAKER_07]: We are the...

13
00:01:00,406 --> 00:01:01,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

14
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,467
[SPEAKER_22]: How many of us are not wearing shoes?

15
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:03,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Officer.

16
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:03,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Officer.

17
00:01:04,048 --> 00:01:06,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's an orgy going on next door.

18
00:01:06,829 --> 00:01:08,929
[SPEAKER_22]: We are officially a Mississippi orgy.

19
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,770
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a no on eight sign in front of their house.

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,751
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a gay orgy going on in our neighborhood.

21
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:14,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

22
00:01:15,252 --> 00:01:15,472
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob.

23
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:16,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Laundry.

24
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:17,312
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

25
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:18,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

26
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,114
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the most gay I've ever heard you sound ever.

27
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Not me, where have you been?

28
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:33,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, we're a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and it is just madness tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio in the studio.

29
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,251
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

30
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:39,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Woo!

31
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:39,692
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

32
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:40,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Woo!

33
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:44,654
[SPEAKER_07]: and also say hello to what?

34
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Sackboy Loki!

35
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:51,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello!

36
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:54,777
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, the visuals for this are just too much.

37
00:01:55,157 --> 00:02:00,880
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're watching tonight on Justed TV, Loki is actually wearing a ginormous Sackboy costume.

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,561
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, he's finally dressed up for the listeners.

39
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,501
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very excited.

40
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:07,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, it's not Tingle, but he is wearing a Sackboy costume.

41
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:12,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So if he sounds a little muffled, that's because the microphone is like inside the Sackboy costume.

42
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:13,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

43
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:14,565
[SPEAKER_05]: And not in a dirty way.

44
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:15,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

45
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:20,568
[SPEAKER_22]: That would give a whole new meaning to talking out of his ass.

46
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:26,590
[SPEAKER_07]: This is horrible radio, but the visual of it is just way too funny because Sackboy's mouth doesn't move.

47
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,272
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why people need to be watching Justin TV.

48
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:30,692
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

49
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, podcast listeners.

50
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:35,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this one just isn't going to make much sense to you.

51
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,311
[SPEAKER_22]: Also joining us tonight... They can go on Justin.TV and check the highlights.

52
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,311
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, because I know the listeners are highlighting this on Justin.TV.

53
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.

54
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:43,772
[SPEAKER_07]: All one word.

55
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,652
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of guests here in the studio tonight.

56
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:47,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Some new faces and some old faces.

57
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:51,494
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to quickly introduce folks, because you might just... I guess we have introduction music.

58
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Awesome.

59
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:54,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, program.

60
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:56,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, look.

61
00:02:56,735 --> 00:02:58,996
[SPEAKER_07]: What show would it be without a technical fuck-up, right?

62
00:02:59,036 --> 00:02:59,936
[SPEAKER_07]: In the first five minutes.

63
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:04,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, say hello to some of our guests tonight.

64
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:09,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining us, representing the women here, holding it down with DarkSakura, say hello to Mel!

65
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:10,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello!

66
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:13,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi Mel, you can grab the mic, it's okay, it won't bite unless you ask.

67
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:13,889
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

68
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:14,629
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm good.

69
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:15,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

70
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:18,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you've been on the show before, if it has been a long, long time.

71
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:19,472
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I haven't been on the show before.

72
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:21,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so quickly, what kind of games do you like to play?

73
00:03:22,628 --> 00:03:23,889
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of shit on my DS.

74
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you go.

75
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:26,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo DS fangirl.

76
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:31,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, also joining us tonight, a very familiar face from the past, say hello to Drew Nami.

77
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:32,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Madness?

78
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,479
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Orange Lounge!

79
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the cops are really going to get called.

80
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:43,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello as well to The Doctor.

81
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:44,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm The Doctor.

82
00:03:45,068 --> 00:03:45,408
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

83
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:45,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's 300 shows!

84
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:46,729
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm naked!

85
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:51,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Really?

86
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:53,877
[SPEAKER_22]: And you're on camera.

87
00:03:54,277 --> 00:04:00,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello as well to a person who has not been here in a long time.

88
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:01,363
[SPEAKER_07]: When was the last time you were here?

89
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, two or three years ago.

90
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Say hello to Arcadian42.

91
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:09,690
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, a dark shadow from the past returns for destruction.

92
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:15,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And what kind of, since you haven't been on the show in so long, what kind of games do you like?

93
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:17,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Adventure.

94
00:04:18,914 --> 00:04:20,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Sega, Sega, and more Sega.

95
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:20,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Sega.

96
00:04:21,195 --> 00:04:22,796
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't played some Sega games in a while.

97
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:28,578
[SPEAKER_29]: But I have loads of Saturn games and Genesis and all that kind of stuff.

98
00:04:28,758 --> 00:04:31,139
[SPEAKER_22]: And when he grows up, he wants to be Sega Tassanchiro.

99
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:34,760
[SPEAKER_07]: His house really is like a Sega museum, I just want to point out.

100
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty awesome.

101
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, is this gentleman going to introduce himself too?

102
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:39,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And you are?

103
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:40,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiccup Boy.

104
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:41,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Hiccup Boy?

105
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:42,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that your online name?

106
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes.

107
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:44,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there you go.

108
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:44,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiccup Boy.

109
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,561
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of games are you into, Hiccup Boy?

110
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,683
[SPEAKER_04]: RPG and first-person shooter.

111
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:51,484
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the best RPG of all time?

112
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:51,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever?

113
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to go with Final Fantasy VII.

114
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:55,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of my house.

115
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy VI, way better.

116
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of my house.

117
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

118
00:04:58,992 --> 00:04:59,532
[SPEAKER_04]: What about points?

119
00:04:59,552 --> 00:05:00,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I go with 9?

120
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,214
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 runs number 2.

121
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:02,295
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 is pretty good.

122
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:04,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all right.

123
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:04,757
[SPEAKER_07]: At least you didn't say 11.

124
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:05,738
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

125
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:07,240
[SPEAKER_07]: No me gusta.

126
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,281
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, no, I'm just kidding.

127
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:12,623
[SPEAKER_07]: We like having a variety of opinions here in the studio, even when they're wrong.

128
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:14,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's welcome the chat as well.

129
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:19,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, joining us as they do every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

130
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:22,610
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, pardon the madness.

131
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little crazy tonight.

132
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:30,195
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, we started this show on June 23, 2002 on our live 365 feed.

133
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:36,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we are six and a half years later on All Games Radio with our 300th episode.

134
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,900
[SPEAKER_07]: So a big thank you.

135
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,741
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

136
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:09,030
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a big fable.

137
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:20,978
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't do much playing in it, however Dan did, and he's been throwing fire at people and showing off his trophy, which I think is entirely, and flipping everyone off, which is just the best ever.

138
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:26,481
[SPEAKER_22]: His guy looks kind of like a gorilla, with a red coat, and it's kind of cool.

139
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:32,285
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've decided that when I play Fable 2, I'm going to make the biggest raging lesbian ever.

140
00:06:32,665 --> 00:06:34,587
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still a chicken chaser, you chase chickens.

141
00:06:35,578 --> 00:06:36,601
[SPEAKER_22]: I've, okay.

142
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:43,737
[SPEAKER_22]: And, but he had to do the thing where he had to wear dreads and mutton chops and the dress and they said it was the wrong dress.

143
00:06:44,557 --> 00:06:45,317
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was kind of funny.

144
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:47,858
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've been playing Ragnarok, of course.

145
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:52,019
[SPEAKER_22]: And I got my DS, finally.

146
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,759
[SPEAKER_22]: However, it's not here.

147
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,179
[SPEAKER_22]: It's at home.

148
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,499
[SPEAKER_22]: But Dan got me a black DS.

149
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Much, very similar to Melchon's black DS.

150
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,280
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a blue one.

151
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Except Melchon has like a little Star Wars thing on it.

152
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:04,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty neat.

153
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Little stickers.

154
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:09,682
[SPEAKER_22]: I could totally bust out my Miyamoto stickers, though, from E3 a few years ago.

155
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,383
[SPEAKER_22]: But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.

156
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have a nice one.

157
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:16,593
[SPEAKER_22]: I babysat yesterday too Really?

158
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes Did you play any games with the baby?

159
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,831
[SPEAKER_22]: We went to the jungle gym and played Let's Splash All of the Water in the Fountain

160
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:44,558
[SPEAKER_22]: and um baby's gonna slide down whether you're at the bottom to catch him or not and let's see how many times catch the baby and it was also let's let's see how often Julian will run back to the swings and beg to be in it only to not do anything but look at the other children

161
00:07:45,339 --> 00:08:11,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Orange Lounge Radio official game should be something a lot like WarioWare where all the little micro games are like little in-jokes from the show and there should be one where DarkSakura is there with a big net and it says catch and babies start falling and there's babies falling from the sky I do have to say he's such a good kid that he's the reason why I'm no longer afraid of most babies in small numbers, namely one do you want to eat them like Shane?

162
00:08:12,347 --> 00:08:12,547
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

163
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Shane has subscriptions.

164
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,712
[SPEAKER_22]: We heart you, Shane, but you've got subscriptions.

165
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,413
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not listening.

166
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,113
[SPEAKER_07]: He hates this show.

167
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, he hates everything that he likes.

168
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:24,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

169
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,278
[SPEAKER_22]: High School Musical!

170
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Lord.

171
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:28,840
[SPEAKER_07]: My God!

172
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,441
[SPEAKER_07]: You're cut off.

173
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,302
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no.

174
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:33,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, Sackboy, SackLoki, how was your gaming week?

175
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,186
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play that much this week.

176
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly, I played LittleBigPlanet.

177
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:39,149
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that game.

178
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:45,173
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually... I'm now in the Japanese level, which is pretty cool.

179
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:55,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm dressed up like a ninja, and I've got a... I'm a ninja pirate, because I'm wearing the ninja head, and I've got the pirate outfit, and I'm carrying a frying pan.

180
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's awesome.

181
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And how is Everyone's a Little Bit Racist the game?

182
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:04,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty good, but apparently it's not going to be as racist soon.

183
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:07,557
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, come on.

184
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:08,017
[SPEAKER_07]: It was ridiculous.

185
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,277
[SPEAKER_07]: We were looking at it on Justin.TV last week after the show.

186
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:11,978
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a little present for our live listeners.

187
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:17,679
[SPEAKER_07]: And we saw a bunch of like, you know, the Africa level is all the Africa stereotypes.

188
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,899
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the South America level is all those stereotypes.

189
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the America level was hot dogs and cheeseburgers.

190
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,201
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually it was race cars and jazz.

191
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

192
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:28,601
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

193
00:09:28,641 --> 00:09:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait.

194
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:31,442
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got them out of Casgar, will they shut down everything?

195
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:34,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

196
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:40,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I'm glad, though, when they did fix the song, that they didn't actually remove it from the game.

197
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:43,224
[SPEAKER_05]: They just edited out the lyrics, which is awesome.

198
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the song itself is awesome.

199
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, if the lyrics aren't in there, I'm not sad.

200
00:09:47,345 --> 00:09:48,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

201
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:52,586
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, I've been playing Saints Row 2 multiplayer, because that's fun.

202
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:53,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Still glitchy.

203
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,807
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we found a new trick now.

204
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:59,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, if you throw satchel charges on people, because you can actually stick them to other players.

205
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:09,989
[SPEAKER_05]: If I, for example, stick multiple satchel charges on them, when they respawn, they still have the ones that haven't exploded yet, so you can detonate them again and kill them again, which is kind of a boo-boo there.

206
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:14,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, oddly enough, I've been watching someone play Fable.

207
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you guess who was playing Fable 2?

208
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Harvey.

209
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,331
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife.

210
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:19,900
[SPEAKER_05]: is playing Fable 2.

211
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, your wife, the game hater, is playing Fable 2.

212
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:24,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she's playing Fable 2.

213
00:10:25,003 --> 00:10:25,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's how it happened.

214
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:32,308
[SPEAKER_05]: She saw the commercial for it that they have now where the guy's playing with the little, I forget what you call those things.

215
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:32,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Balls?

216
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:33,769
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not balls.

217
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,980
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

218
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

219
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:14,768
[SPEAKER_05]: She's all, yeah, set it up for me.

220
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So I set it up for her, kind of helped her walk through it.

221
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Now she's way further in the game than I am.

222
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,011
[SPEAKER_05]: But granted, I've only played the game for like less than an hour.

223
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:27,415
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, but she was like literally when I was leaving today to go finish my costume before I came over here.

224
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:31,977
[SPEAKER_05]: She was just like, okay, I got to quit in like half an hour because I have to go to the gym.

225
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:35,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's just seriously contemplating not going to the gym to play the game.

226
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

227
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

228
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:38,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

229
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:39,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Just getting to that point.

230
00:11:41,356 --> 00:11:43,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it brings back memories of Final Fantasy XI.

231
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, a proud gamer moment.

232
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:47,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you a proud gaming husband now?

233
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:54,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think she's going to get bored of it because she's not paying attention to any of the storyline or any of what's supposed to be going on.

234
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,500
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, kill, kill, die, die, die, kill, kill, die, die, die.

235
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,061
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps giving her helpful hints like, you know, her life is slow, you should go find an inn or some potion.

236
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,722
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I don't know where the hell the inn is!

237
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:05,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, go to one of the towns!

238
00:12:05,482 --> 00:12:07,563
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like, I went to the towns, there's no inns there!

239
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:09,174
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

240
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:28,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Stuff like that.

241
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's read some comments from chat.

242
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:35,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com By the way, I know we have a lot of people on Justin TV tonight because of Loki being Sackboy.

243
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is, if Justin TV highlighted us or something.

244
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:47,411
[SPEAKER_07]: But please keep in mind we only read our regular chat room at Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com That's not because we hate you guys at Justin TV, but it's because, well, it's partially that.

245
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:51,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a real hard time reading two chat rooms at once because we are trying to do a show here.

246
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:57,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So chat.orange.com Redertainment in chat says the last time I skipped the gym to game was five years ago.

247
00:12:58,118 --> 00:12:59,599
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been back to the gym since.

248
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,521
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

249
00:13:03,522 --> 00:13:04,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow.

250
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:07,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, so I'll talk about my Gaming Week.

251
00:13:08,485 --> 00:13:10,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally bought a PlayStation 3.

252
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:13,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you booing?! !

253
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:33,580
[SPEAKER_07]: because Wizards and Thugs at least there's good games out now at least you didn't buy it just because oh I want to play there's two good games out now no now now there were finally games I wanted out I want LittleBigPlanet even though I wasn't able to get it yesterday contrary to popular rumor but I have it all set up I have a blu-ray disc at least I have Edward Scissorhands on blu-ray because that movie is awesome

254
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:35,123
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to get an M before Christmas, too.

255
00:13:35,163 --> 00:13:36,044
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks good on the ring.

256
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:40,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to mention, though, that last week I was concerned that I may have to return my copy a little bit.

257
00:13:40,707 --> 00:13:41,828
[SPEAKER_05]: You motherfucker, it's my turn.

258
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:42,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

259
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:44,170
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't have to, thank God.

260
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,051
[SPEAKER_05]: So I get to keep the slightly offensive version.

261
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:46,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

262
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so yeah, I finally took the plunge and got a PlayStation 3.

263
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,346
[SPEAKER_07]: For SingStar ABBA as well, even though that's not out until December.

264
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:56,008
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did buy SingStar PlayStation 3.

265
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:01,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the game itself is kind of crappy compared to, like, Rock Band and other songs you can sing in.

266
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,375
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will tell you the best thing about SingStar PlayStation 3.

267
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:06,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's a couple good things about it.

268
00:14:06,676 --> 00:14:10,059
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really good party game because it has the music videos in the back.

269
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:12,801
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a good game for non-gamers, if that makes sense.

270
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:15,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, it's a good game for people to just pick up the mics and sing and have fun with it.

271
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:31,410
[SPEAKER_07]: and there are a lot of songs on the sing store even though I haven't heard of half of them there's like 300 songs on that store but I'll tell you the best part is that part that's like YouTube that you can go in there and look at the community videos I don't have a webcam myself thank you very much I don't want to put myself on there I do no don't worry about it but

272
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess this is growing up

273
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,657
[SPEAKER_07]: She's so cute.

274
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:59,680
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's the best part of the game is just going on like the YouTube type thing and looking at that.

275
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had fun with it.

276
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:03,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I don't know.

277
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,184
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not for everyone.

278
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:05,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it if you have a lot of parties.

279
00:15:05,626 --> 00:15:09,489
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're a solo gamer, I don't think there's a lot here for you unless you like to sing to yourself.

280
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I'm just holding out for LittleBigPlanet.

281
00:15:12,432 --> 00:15:15,014
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll probably be going back to the 360 in the meantime.

282
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:15,935
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I will say this.

283
00:15:16,576 --> 00:15:20,459
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3 has... I gotta say, that Blu-ray player is pretty awesome.

284
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,143
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does upscale the old movies pretty good on DVD.

285
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:27,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And the media server, I thought, was a lot easier to use than Microsoft's.

286
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the media server's pretty awesome.

287
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I was really surprised.

288
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:31,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of surprised me.

289
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking that the 360 media server would be a lot easier because, you know, hello, Windows, Microsoft.

290
00:15:36,554 --> 00:15:39,237
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the PlayStation 3 one was disgustingly simple.

291
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:40,018
[SPEAKER_05]: However...

292
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:51,436
[SPEAKER_07]: here's a word of advice for you folks don't run the media server and your internet connection at the same time because your internet connection can't hold it on the Playstation 3 that's the one thing about it so

293
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:52,854
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

294
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:53,975
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty much my gaming week.

295
00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:55,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I haven't played a whole lot.

296
00:15:55,516 --> 00:15:58,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Aurora Faint on the iPhone, which is pretty awesome for a free game.

297
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:00,759
[SPEAKER_07]: That game is all kinds of awesome.

298
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:01,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I had another game.

299
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,380
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

300
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,381
[SPEAKER_22]: I downloaded Pole Position Remix.

301
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:05,321
[SPEAKER_07]: How'd you like that?

302
00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:09,224
[SPEAKER_22]: It's actually surprisingly easy to play, but I still suck at Pole Position.

303
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:12,025
[SPEAKER_22]: But the crashes and everything are fantastic.

304
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:14,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I suck at Pole Position.

305
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:21,841
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf in chatroom says, confirmed, Rob likes parents exploiting children on the internet.

306
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:22,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

307
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:25,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute.

308
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,570
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't do this, you don't get to eat.

309
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ross D.O.U.T.

310
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,696
[SPEAKER_07]: says, Rob, I have media server and internet running at the same time, no problem.

311
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:37,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's you.

312
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:38,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Congrats to you.

313
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, it didn't work right for me.

314
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob's special.

315
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:42,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, my special.

316
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:44,644
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I have all the next gen systems.

317
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:45,645
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

318
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:53,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get, you know, if you got Pole Position on the phone, I will say I got Pac-Man on the iPhone, which is kind of neat because you can do motion.

319
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,561
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tilt it.

320
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:54,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't like it.

321
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's kind of dumb.

322
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:58,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you play it once and then it's over, so just get the free trial.

323
00:16:58,366 --> 00:16:58,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't pay for it.

324
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:02,511
[SPEAKER_22]: But the pull position one, though, honestly, it really is playable.

325
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:11,261
[SPEAKER_22]: And on top of that, not only can you have it use your tilt to turn left or right, you can choose to have your accelerator or your brake on screen.

326
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:16,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Or you can actually have a steering wheel on screen to steer with.

327
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:18,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Or you can use a slider.

328
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,851
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's kind of cool.

329
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:31,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking in chat, and I lied, I looked at JustinTV chat for a minute, and a person by the name of SonyPS3Sucks, who I'm sure is just thrilled to hear my news this week, says that Jelly Car is on iPhone for free.

330
00:17:32,274 --> 00:17:39,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot about that, I read about that somewhere, and that was actually a really awesome game on the XNA service, the little beta thing they had there, so I really want to check that out on iPhone.

331
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there you go.

332
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:44,807
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

333
00:17:58,935 --> 00:18:13,455
[SPEAKER_23]: it's actually pretty neat it's got an interface that you can trace the writing so you can really learn your brush strokes and stuff it's got a bunch of fun little games to play that actually really have been helping my memory and helping me remember the shit that I learned a few years ago when I actually did take Japanese class

334
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:20,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you say that it's something that somebody could pick up and learn Japanese with, or is it better as a supplement to an actual Japanese class?

335
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:34,140
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's better as a supplement to an actual Japanese class, but it is nice because it does have a dictionary and a phrase guide thing built into it, so if you are somewhere and you need to say something that you don't exactly know how to say, you can look up real quick and be like, this is what I need to say, this is how I have to say it.

336
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

337
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew, what's one thing you've been playing this week?

338
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:41,224
[SPEAKER_03]: World of Warcraft, The Burning Cr- Brains.

339
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Brains.

340
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:45,167
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a story coming on that later, but how's Wobbengal?

341
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:46,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you excited about Lich King?

342
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very excited.

343
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been leveling with Chimera lately.

344
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to that Recruit a Friend thing, triple experience.

345
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,317
[SPEAKER_03]: She and I are going through Outlands as Mage and Warlock.

346
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:56,437
[SPEAKER_03]: 6G3 so far.

347
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:57,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a blast.

348
00:18:57,598 --> 00:18:59,238
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you most looking forward to about Lich King?

349
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Death Knights.

350
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:02,660
[SPEAKER_07]: That and motorcycles.

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

352
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,582
[SPEAKER_07]: The Doctor, who by the way brought us some mushrooms for the studio.

353
00:19:07,602 --> 00:19:08,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you can see them on Justin.TV.

354
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hold one up for the Justin.TV folks?

355
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,004
[SPEAKER_07]: What the mushrooms look like here?

356
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:13,691
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

357
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:14,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.

358
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:16,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are awesome.

359
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you make those just for this, or did you steal those from your work?

360
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:21,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year at my work, we did Mario as the theme for Halloween.

361
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:23,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So one of my coworkers made them.

362
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:24,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

363
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for stealing them and bringing them here.

364
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,340
[SPEAKER_07]: What's one game you've been playing this week, Doctor?

365
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Hiccup Boy's gotten me back into DDR, which, oh my god, that's like the best exercise ever.

366
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,423
[SPEAKER_07]: You've lost some weight, too.

367
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:35,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, maybe.

368
00:19:35,404 --> 00:19:36,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, just today.

369
00:19:37,145 --> 00:19:39,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, because my hand's all sweaty from DDR.

370
00:19:40,206 --> 00:19:41,027
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of DDR?

371
00:19:41,927 --> 00:19:42,708
[SPEAKER_11]: It's old school DDR.

372
00:19:42,768 --> 00:19:43,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like

373
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:44,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Arcadian, Sonic Chronicles DS

374
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:10,613
[SPEAKER_07]: DS, and that's like what, it's all the old school Sonic games?

375
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:12,373
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a new RPG.

376
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought it was actually called Sonic RPG.

377
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:16,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, how is it?

378
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:17,255
[SPEAKER_29]: Good?

379
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:18,455
[SPEAKER_29]: It's pretty good so far.

380
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,316
[SPEAKER_29]: I've played like three or four hours.

381
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:22,896
[SPEAKER_29]: Halfway through the second mission.

382
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:24,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any other RPGs you can kind of compare to?

383
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

384
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:34,742
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a little bit different because you're kind of moving around with the stylus.

385
00:20:34,862 --> 00:20:44,865
[SPEAKER_29]: Actually, because there's an interesting system where if you've got to chase the enemies or run away from them, so you basically have the characters running away or running towards the...

386
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,494
[SPEAKER_29]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

387
00:21:02,923 --> 00:21:05,924
[SPEAKER_29]: from hitting the boxes so that they can catch up.

388
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:06,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

389
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:12,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like this game might be redeeming the Sonic franchise a little bit after a relatively last few weak years.

390
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I haven't played any of the games in a long time.

391
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:17,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It's for the best, Bradley.

392
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:20,347
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to stay a Sega fanboy, you probably should stay away from them.

393
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:24,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's also ask KickUpBoy, what's one game you've been playing this week?

394
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:30,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I kind of haven't gotten over COD 4 at all yet.

395
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:31,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, a shooter fan.

396
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:32,526
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that game good?

397
00:21:32,846 --> 00:21:33,346
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

398
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:34,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really great.

399
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:41,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Except you get those people that are just like, oh, on one-on-one I can kick your ass, and then we go on one-on-one and they leave shortly after that.

400
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,792
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say is the singular best thing about that game?

401
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:52,635
[SPEAKER_04]: The best thing has got to be just... There's not just one.

402
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:55,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking forward to COD5?

403
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yes and no.

404
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:02,967
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of went back in time, so I'm kind of like, oh, I feel like back to the future kind of thing.

405
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:06,251
[SPEAKER_07]: What's something they need to do in COD5 they didn't do before?

406
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:12,265
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to make sure no juggernaut is allowed because that's just kind of wimpy.

407
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:52,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Our username on LiveJournal is Orange Lounge Or on MySpace, we're Orange Lounge Radio On Facebook, we're the OL Army And now on Twitter, we're OLR Yes, that's four different sites and four different names Go figure, it just never works out Also, I want to say this Since we've been doing this diligently for 300 episodes We are taking next week off There will be no show next week So there you have it Because we earned it We will be providing live footage of a colonoscopy

408
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:53,833
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

409
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:54,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the deal.

410
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:02,756
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not having a colonoscopy, but you guys might remember if you've been listening to the show this year, I had some medical issues back in April that kept me out of the show for a week.

411
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:07,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having surgery Wednesday, and that's why there's not going to be a show on Sunday because I'm still going to be recovering.

412
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:09,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a gallbladder removal.

413
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,878
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.

414
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:11,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a big deal.

415
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Other people have had it done.

416
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:18,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It's laparoscopic, so it's not going to be a big deal, but I am planning to pretty much be out of everything for a week.

417
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:19,881
[SPEAKER_07]: There you have it.

418
00:23:20,302 --> 00:23:21,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you'll understand.

419
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:23,164
[SPEAKER_07]: So no kicking and screaming.

420
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:23,804
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no show.

421
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:30,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Take a chance to play some more games or listen to one of our other wonderful shows that we co-broadcast with on All Games Radio.

422
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's move into some gaming news then tonight, I think, if we're ready.

423
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:37,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

424
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:37,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

425
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:38,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

426
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:45,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you may remember the new PSP 3000 was announced and has finally made it to the market.

427
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:50,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's not really being received that well.

428
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:58,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Problem is, apparently the new advanced LCD screen that's on it is causing some issues with scan lines.

429
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:02,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Noticeable scan lines and it looks very bad.

430
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:10,922
[SPEAKER_05]: It is now a little bit brighter, and the colors are a little bit better, but the scan lines look like crap.

431
00:24:11,403 --> 00:24:21,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sony is apparently looking into the problem right now, but no sort of fix is being done.

432
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:29,831
[SPEAKER_05]: And since this is a phenomenon that is caused by hardware characteristics, there is no plan to fix it with the system software update.

433
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:45,671
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you might want to hold on to those PSP-2000s and forego the built-in microphone and, I don't know, better, questionably better LCD screen.

434
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe just wait a little while for it to get fixed.

435
00:24:47,731 --> 00:24:49,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it possible that they're going to, like, kind of fix these?

436
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:54,893
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to replace them if that's the case.

437
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:57,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

438
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:06,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's kind of interesting also is that it seems like there might be some type of very quiet under-the-radar recall going on right now.

439
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:14,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's because people are complaining about this, and apparently the description actually got this slight word change going on.

440
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:21,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of saying the system features an improved LCD screen, it says the system features an advanced LCD screen.

441
00:25:21,571 --> 00:25:25,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can kind of see that they might be kind of admitting that there's something going on.

442
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:35,079
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of reminds me of, was it, if anyone's watched Invader Zim, when he's introduced to his sidekick, Gur, he's like, he kind of looks broken.

443
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:37,661
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all, he's not broken, he's advanced.

444
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:45,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the other interesting thing is that Amazon.com just suddenly canceled a bunch of pre-orders for the PSP 3000.

445
00:25:47,244 --> 00:25:51,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Some folks had the limited edition 4GB memory entertainment pack for this thing reserved.

446
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:58,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazon sent everybody emails that said that the item was not available from the sources, so that they canceled all the orders.

447
00:25:58,887 --> 00:26:01,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in fact, we got something similar to that.

448
00:26:01,987 --> 00:26:03,568
[SPEAKER_05]: They were expected in...

449
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:04,969
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.

450
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Play it in stores and see if it's something that bugs you that bad.

451
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:27,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I bet to a lot of gamers, they're not going to give a shit.

452
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,894
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, it looks pretty bad.

453
00:26:31,034 --> 00:26:33,315
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of PSP 2000 systems out there.

454
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:42,318
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, all you're supposedly improving is the LCD screen, which obviously is not improved this time, and a built-in microphone.

455
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:46,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So if microphones aren't really a big deal for you, I mean, you can go buy one for like $20.

456
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:48,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

457
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would just maybe hold off.

458
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:53,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you need to buy another system?

459
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:56,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, after all, the last system update came about a year ago.

460
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well.

461
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:02,163
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that, Meltan?

462
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:03,104
[SPEAKER_07]: She didn't have a mic.

463
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:06,707
[SPEAKER_23]: I said not to mention there's hardly any new PSP games coming out.

464
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:08,548
[SPEAKER_23]: They're like, here's a bunch of new systems to throw at you.

465
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:11,030
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got like 20 games coming out in the next six months.

466
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,410
[SPEAKER_23]: Have fun.

467
00:27:13,972 --> 00:27:14,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

468
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:18,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll see what continues to develop over there and hopefully some PSP games.

469
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:19,616
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of good stuff in 2009.

470
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:19,896
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

471
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,671
[SPEAKER_22]: That could possibly be, but honestly, you know my opinion on the PSP.

472
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, it's the same opinion I have on any system.

473
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:30,613
[SPEAKER_06]: It stinks.

474
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,974
[SPEAKER_22]: Only as good as the games that are on it.

475
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:35,115
[SPEAKER_22]: It does have Popolocross, which is a cute game.

476
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:36,195
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

477
00:27:37,076 --> 00:27:41,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, this comes as an absolute surprise to no one.

478
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:43,458
[SPEAKER_22]: Because, what?

479
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,240
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you just like gasping into the microphone as if you're in a porn?

480
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,880
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm no one.

481
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:52,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Do that a little bit more throaty.

482
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:52,959
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

483
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,740
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

484
00:27:54,221 --> 00:27:54,681
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I don't.

485
00:27:54,962 --> 00:27:55,182
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

486
00:27:55,603 --> 00:27:55,803
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

487
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:56,705
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

488
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:57,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

489
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:57,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

490
00:27:58,748 --> 00:27:59,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Rob.

491
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,454
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, you have to mimic the master here.

492
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:17,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, well, the game was trademarked in July, but there is going to be Star Wars The Old Republic, which is the MMO that's based off of KOTOR, Knights of the Old Republic.

493
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:24,241
[SPEAKER_22]: Also the term coined by our friend Krista Skrotor when she worked for Lucas back in the day.

494
00:28:24,938 --> 00:28:37,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, with this, it's supposed to be 300 years after Knights of the Old Republic 2, which is 3,500 years before the film, and you can choose between either the Republic or the Sith Empire.

495
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:47,957
[SPEAKER_22]: You can either be light side or dark side, but you can be one of those alignments within whatever your faction is.

496
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:53,621
[SPEAKER_22]: So I guess you could be chaotic neutral or lawful evil or, oh wait, wrong game.

497
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:54,042
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

498
00:28:55,543 --> 00:28:57,605
[SPEAKER_22]: There's two classes that have been revealed already.

499
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:05,935
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the Sith, the Jedi, and they use lightsabers, and the Force, and we have no idea when it's coming out or what it's coming out on.

500
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but, but, can I kill Jar Jar Binks?

501
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:13,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Jar Jar has not been born yet or conceived.

502
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:18,572
[SPEAKER_22]: She could probably find... Can I find Jar Jar's super great grandma and kill her?

503
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:22,034
[SPEAKER_22]: And cut off the fishy cock.

504
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:25,596
[SPEAKER_07]: The fishy cock?

505
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:29,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you just tell me to go slice off the fishy cock?

506
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Fish do not have cocks.

507
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,521
[SPEAKER_11]: They deposit their eggs into the ocean.

508
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:37,323
[SPEAKER_22]: But they're supposed to be humanoid creatures, so I assume that there's some cock involved.

509
00:29:39,105 --> 00:29:41,907
[SPEAKER_07]: There's always talking about... They're aquatic.

510
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:51,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, needless to say, the internet and the gamers on the internet all had a... Needless to say, the collective internet gamers had a giant orgasm when this game was announced.

511
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,497
[SPEAKER_07]: All their fish cocks went off at once.

512
00:29:56,158 --> 00:30:00,221
[SPEAKER_07]: In a fountain of... There's a lot of people definitely looking forward to a KOTOR MMO.

513
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,463
[SPEAKER_22]: In a fountain of... Tamago.

514
00:30:03,563 --> 00:30:05,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard there are people that are going to leave WoW for this.

515
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:08,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you and I are going to go play Star Trek.

516
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,051
[SPEAKER_22]: but I'm not leaving well because guess what?

517
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:10,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

518
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:11,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I already left.

519
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:12,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

520
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:13,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck your KOTOR.

521
00:30:13,973 --> 00:30:15,314
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Star Trek MMO coming out.

522
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:17,775
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to have some Star Trek.

523
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:19,196
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a Star Trek MMO coming out?

524
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:20,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Where the fuck have you been?

525
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:21,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I cream my shorts right now?

526
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:23,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I love Star Trek so much.

527
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you stand up so they can see?

528
00:30:24,618 --> 00:30:25,399
[SPEAKER_22]: Star Trek Online.

529
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:27,480
[SPEAKER_11]: This is called Star Trek Online.

530
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,041
[SPEAKER_11]: But what time period?

531
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:31,522
[SPEAKER_22]: After current.

532
00:30:32,282 --> 00:30:33,103
I think it's set like 35.

533
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,941
[SPEAKER_07]: 35 or 40 years after Nemesis.

534
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:41,025
[SPEAKER_22]: So you get your own joystick for your ship.

535
00:30:41,345 --> 00:30:41,946
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

536
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,228
[SPEAKER_11]: And Janeway's dead and Picard's dead.

537
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:46,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Janeway could still be alive.

538
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds awesome.

539
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:55,798
[SPEAKER_22]: You can do customizing on your ship.

540
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,900
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can calibrate the Dilithium Crystal.

541
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,543
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want there to be an achievement called Redstrip Massacre.

542
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:13,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wait, if it's set in that series, okay, if it was red shirts first and then yellow in Next Generation, then what color are they going to go to for the next series to come out?

543
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:14,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Magenta.

544
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:15,894
[SPEAKER_22]: Magenta shirts, no.

545
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:20,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm going to get some comments from chat.

546
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:29,337
[SPEAKER_07]: RossDLUT says, what I'm concerned about with Old Republic is that A, this virtually guarantees no KOTOR 3, and B, Bioware's never done an MMO before.

547
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:31,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't shake the idea that they might try to ape WoW.

548
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:32,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, WoW's a good game.

549
00:31:33,918 --> 00:31:43,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, we also have GS68 says, I was going to get a PSP 3000 for Christmas, but I think I'll just save for a desktop arcade poppin' con.

550
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:43,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

551
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:47,582
[SPEAKER_07]: SJ100 Matt says I'm waiting for the OLR Starfleet.

552
00:31:50,023 --> 00:31:50,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

553
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with some more news.

554
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:54,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to PlayStation 3.

555
00:31:54,765 --> 00:31:58,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, PlayStation Home isn't even out yet and it's already been hacked.

556
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

557
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:28,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently he has decrypted over 9,000 files belonging to it, and this is supposedly going to lead to better understanding how PlayStation 3 games and the PlayStation Network works and its structure.

558
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:41,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So apparently it's all back-end stuff, and they're going to hopefully allow it to lead to other exploits and possibly custom stuff for the cross-media bar and all that fun stuff.

559
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, right now it's a whole bunch of nothing.

560
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,431
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's progress, and progress is always good, I guess.

561
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:48,031
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what I think is hilarious?

562
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:50,132
[SPEAKER_22]: That these people do this as a hobby.

563
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:57,195
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what, I bet the best way to end all the hacking and everything is to offer these guys jobs.

564
00:32:58,615 --> 00:32:59,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, they wouldn't do that.

565
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:01,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It would actually be original content.

566
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:02,616
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want that.

567
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:04,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Pay them.

568
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We want rehashes of everything.

569
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but how long before Sony tries to close this gap?

570
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:13,504
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the home's not even out yet, really.

571
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:14,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not very long.

572
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:18,746
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, hey, I don't know.

573
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat, I guess.

574
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:22,688
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fun to say, hey, look, I hacked home.

575
00:33:22,788 --> 00:33:24,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm SkaterFU.

576
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:25,989
[SPEAKER_07]: I hacked home.

577
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:39,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's kind of neat though, speaking of the home beta, if you do want to get into the home beta, just keep an eye out for the next issue of Core, which is going to do some features behind the scenes regarding home.

578
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:46,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're also going to have home beta entries, so you will be able to test home before home launches, whenever home actually launches.

579
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:48,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's probably going to launch soon.

580
00:33:49,150 --> 00:34:04,798
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, do you remember on last week's show, there was a big to-do about the whole censorship in the game LittleBigPlanet, and how one of the songs controversially quoted the Koran in its lyrics, and Sony was going to patch, they were really nervous about this, they were going to patch the game, take the lyrics out.

581
00:34:04,898 --> 00:34:05,479
[SPEAKER_07]: It was retarded.

582
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing.

583
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of an interesting follow-up to this whole thing.

584
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:14,061
[SPEAKER_07]: We were kind of waiting for comment from the other side.

585
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:16,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, hmm, what's the community going to think?

586
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:20,282
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the rest of the Muslim community going to think if this word gets out there that this is in the game?

587
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you might be surprised at what happened.

588
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:29,204
[SPEAKER_07]: M. Zudi Jassir, MD, and he is the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy.

589
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:32,565
[SPEAKER_07]: He talked to a website called Edge Gaming or the Edge Podcast.

590
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:36,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Network, and he said something kind of interesting here.

591
00:34:36,546 --> 00:34:43,607
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that censorship and Sony being willing to bend at the request for censorship is counterproductive to the freedom of speech.

592
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:44,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me give you this quote.

593
00:34:45,327 --> 00:34:58,090
[SPEAKER_07]: "...to demand that the game be withdrawn is predicated on a society which gives theocrats who wish to control speech far more value than the central principle of freedom of expression upon which the very practice and freedom of religion is based."

594
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:07,516
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that the music writer is a devout Muslim should highlight that at the core of this issue is not about offending all Muslims but only about freedom of expression and the free market.

595
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:23,367
[SPEAKER_07]: He says he himself does not endorse the use of the Quran verses in non-educational video games but he says in this case basically that the First Amendment takes precedence and that the Islamic Foundation stands against all forms of censorship.

596
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:28,090
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's beautiful and isn't that sort of what we said last week?

597
00:35:28,482 --> 00:35:29,503
[SPEAKER_07]: In a way, in a way.

598
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:36,311
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is kind of interesting to see that now Sony has almost a little bit of egg on it.

599
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:37,872
[SPEAKER_11]: They just can't win with this.

600
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:42,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Rice Princess was called and she said censorship equals... Thank you.

601
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:43,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she coming tonight?

602
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, she's six, so she's going to try to make it.

603
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:49,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't she Fire Princess now?

604
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, she is Fire Princess.

605
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:50,986
[SPEAKER_11]: No, she's six.

606
00:35:51,006 --> 00:35:52,427
[SPEAKER_11]: She's going to try to make it, though.

607
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,449
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, everybody say, Fire Princess.

608
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:55,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

609
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:57,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

610
00:35:58,312 --> 00:36:01,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on and talk about some... Oh, by the way, just a real quick note on LittleBigPlanet.

611
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:03,517
[SPEAKER_07]: The 1.02 patch is out now.

612
00:36:04,071 --> 00:36:06,552
[SPEAKER_07]: and it basically just strips the lyrics out of the song.

613
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:09,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it doesn't take the song out, it just removes the lyrics.

614
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:10,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is fine.

615
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I didn't understand what they meant anyway, so we're right there.

616
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:19,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they have a big to-do about this way back in the day with that game War Gods?

617
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:24,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't one of the tracks in that game quote the Koran or something and they took that out?

618
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:24,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, who knows.

619
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,321
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been an issue for a while with other games.

620
00:36:28,341 --> 00:36:29,242
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think people would learn.

621
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,412
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like bullshit to me the whole time.

622
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,052
[SPEAKER_22]: It really is.

623
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:34,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

624
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be watching my language.

625
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:37,634
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, fuck that.

626
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:38,874
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

627
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:40,615
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like I said last week.

628
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:44,137
[SPEAKER_22]: If they wanted to be offended at somebody, they should have been offended at the artist that made the song.

629
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:49,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Which I think is completely retarded anyway since he himself, as stated, was a devout Muslim.

630
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,701
[SPEAKER_22]: So, whatever.

631
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but isn't that... So he was a Muslim, the guy that wrote the song?

632
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:54,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

633
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:57,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's like, you know, there's Ninju, and that's made by a Jewish guy.

634
00:36:57,624 --> 00:36:57,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Like...

635
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:00,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you seen Ninja?

636
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,031
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

637
00:37:01,091 --> 00:37:01,591
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't.

638
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:05,872
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, before we unravel more conversation on the program tonight, let's get to some release dates.

[SPEAKER_03]: Cop.

646
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:16,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, cop.

647
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:22,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, someone did these episodes on TV, on some internet TV site that's called Jesus Christ Super Cop.

648
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:23,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

650
00:37:25,656 --> 00:37:26,937

[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know why this is just now coming out.

725
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:22,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto 4?

726
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:24,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, never mind.

727
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting confused because right above it I'm reading Gran Turismo.

728
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:27,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

729
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

730
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so yes, Japan finally gets their version of Grand Theft Auto 4.

731
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:35,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Gran Turismo 5 Prologue does come out in Japan this week.

732
00:43:35,718 --> 00:43:35,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Spec 3.

733
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:39,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And Little Big Planet also makes its way to Japan this week on the 30th.

734
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:47,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Gran Turismo 5 Prologue hasn't come out in... This is Spec 3, so it's probably like... What the hell's the difference?

735
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,452
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably different cars to get people to buy it again.

736
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:51,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

737
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:53,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, now, wait a minute.

738
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry if you didn't get to see that turn, but that's gay.

739
00:43:55,095 --> 00:43:55,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

740
00:43:56,517 --> 00:43:58,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

741
00:43:58,498 --> 00:43:59,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to play something for Loki.

742
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:00,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

743
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:00,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop the show.

744
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:01,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop the show.

745
00:44:03,462 --> 00:44:04,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to play something for Loki here.

746
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:09,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Yo, yo, yo, check out this shit, right?

747
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:09,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?

748
00:44:10,073 --> 00:44:11,435
[SPEAKER_26]: That's so gay.

749
00:44:11,455 --> 00:44:12,436
[SPEAKER_26]: That's really gay.

750
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,317
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those pants.

751
00:44:14,337 --> 00:44:15,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't say that.

752
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:16,339
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

753
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something is dumb or stupid.

754
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:21,564
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insulting.

755
00:44:23,706 --> 00:44:30,993
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said, man, this pepper shaker is so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache.

756
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:32,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Just saying.

757
00:44:33,777 --> 00:44:36,458
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say that's so gay, do you realize what you say?

758
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:37,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Knock it off.

759
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,472
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo Wii, never mind, I'm not going to get political right now.

760
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:10,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo Wii, My Sims Kingdom comes out this week, as does Bokujou Monogatari, Waku Waku Animal March.

761
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:12,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, on the Wii.

762
00:45:12,658 --> 00:45:19,962
[SPEAKER_07]: As well as Hula Wii, Mina de Furo Oduro, and Shape Boxing, Wii Day Enjoy Diet.

763
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:25,965
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably everybody Hula Hoop, which would be a very interesting game.

764
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:26,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

765
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:28,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Yumeimi Hakusho, Second Dream

766
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:47,937
[SPEAKER_07]: On the Nintendo DS, Chocobox comes out.

767
00:45:48,637 --> 00:45:51,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Slump and Arale Chan.

768
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:52,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Chocobox Chocoball Boxing?

769
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that would be amazing.

770
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:59,283
[SPEAKER_22]: Dr. Slump was done by the artist that did Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. Ah, there you go.

771
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,904
[SPEAKER_07]: It is Chocoball Boxing.

772
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back to boxing with Chocoball.

773
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:05,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Chocobox is not a game.

774
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:07,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a case for your DS.

775
00:46:09,108 --> 00:46:11,470
[SPEAKER_11]: What are they making Chocoball Boxing?

776
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,750
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be pretty awesome.

777
00:46:14,011 --> 00:46:18,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Tales of Innocence gets a price reduction and a game called Vitamin Y comes out.

778
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:19,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

779
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:20,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Because.

780
00:46:22,017 --> 00:46:25,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly, on the Sony PSP, is there anything coming out this week?

781
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you actually would be surprised.

782
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:29,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, there's quite a bit coming out this week.

783
00:46:29,562 --> 00:46:37,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Cardinal Arc Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G gets a price reduction and the best, as does Rockman Rockman.

784
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:41,410
[SPEAKER_07]: That would just be, you know, you know how they remade Mega Man 1 for PSP?

785
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:41,911
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that.

786
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:43,452
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that whole thing.

787
00:46:44,437 --> 00:46:45,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.

788
00:46:46,017 --> 00:46:47,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go back to some more gaming news.

789
00:46:47,998 --> 00:46:48,638
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we gotta?

790
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:49,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we gotta.

791
00:46:50,358 --> 00:46:52,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, this is about death.

792
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:53,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

793
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,819
[SPEAKER_22]: Ultimate, final character death.

794
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:06,301
[SPEAKER_22]: A 43-year-old Japanese woman was arrested for killing her virtual husband on MapleStory.

795
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:09,922
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, where's our stupid person music, Rob?

796
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:13,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, did she kill him in game?

797
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:14,991
[SPEAKER_22]: She killed him in game.

798
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:16,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

799
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,851
[SPEAKER_07]: But she got arrested for killing him in game?

800
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:19,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Or did she kill him for real real?

801
00:47:19,751 --> 00:47:20,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's what happened.

802
00:47:20,552 --> 00:47:22,452
[SPEAKER_22]: No, she killed him in... This is what happened.

803
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:24,672
[SPEAKER_22]: She's a piano teacher.

804
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:35,054
[SPEAKER_22]: 43-year-old piano teacher was furious because she had been divorced in game.

805
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:40,615
[SPEAKER_22]: So she accessed his login and deleted his character.

806
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:44,450
[SPEAKER_22]: So she killed him in-game.

807
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:53,578
[SPEAKER_22]: She's in jail in Sapporo, and she's facing charges of illegally accessing a computer and manipulating data.

808
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,003
[SPEAKER_22]: Her in-game husband was a 33-year-old office worker, and...

809
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:03,677
[SPEAKER_22]: I really don't know what he thinks of it.

810
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:04,778
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no comment about that.

811
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:12,664
[SPEAKER_22]: But this happened last May, and the woman could pay fines and potentially a five-year jail sentence if she's convicted.

812
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:15,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

813
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:36,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I can't be held accountable for all the people I kill.

814
00:48:36,638 --> 00:48:39,381
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Dark Knight says it's a huge crime in Japan.

815
00:48:40,202 --> 00:48:41,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Look, this is the thing.

816
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:49,331
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand it, and honestly, I would want some sort of retaliation.

817
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:51,273
[SPEAKER_22]: She did break the law.

818
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:57,078
[SPEAKER_22]: She illegally accessed his information and she broke the law.

819
00:48:57,538 --> 00:49:03,080
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I just think it's so fucking retarded that this is Mabel's story!

820
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,081
[SPEAKER_22]: It's free!

821
00:49:06,481 --> 00:49:10,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I would be pissed off if someone did that to my Ragnarok account.

822
00:49:11,123 --> 00:49:13,444
[SPEAKER_22]: I would be pissed off if that happened on my Ragnarok account.

823
00:49:14,464 --> 00:49:14,824
[SPEAKER_22]: You know.

824
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:16,305
[SPEAKER_22]: But...

825
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:18,429
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not the end of the world.

826
00:49:18,449 --> 00:49:19,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Five years in jail?

827
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:22,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, God, pissing you off is bad enough.

828
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:23,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine the phone call?

829
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,873
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you mean pissing me off is bad enough?

830
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:27,595
[SPEAKER_22]: What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Rob?

831
00:49:27,655 --> 00:49:28,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

832
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:29,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly as it was intended.

833
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:31,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine the phone call?

834
00:49:31,817 --> 00:49:34,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to report a murder of my character.

835
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, see, I was thinking of the World of Warcraft South Park episode.

836
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:44,746
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, and he's killing people's characters.

837
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:45,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Mom!

838
00:49:46,454 --> 00:49:46,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Bathroom!

839
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:48,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Bathroom!

840
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:53,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I am such an achievement whore now.

841
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:54,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, hey, let's move on with the news.

842
00:49:57,706 --> 00:50:00,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I've been distracted because the doctor has boobs now.

843
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And boobs are distracting.

844
00:50:03,912 --> 00:50:04,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

845
00:50:05,814 --> 00:50:07,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what kind of doctor you are.

846
00:50:07,736 --> 00:50:08,477
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the doctor.

847
00:50:09,158 --> 00:50:10,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Doctor.

848
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:24,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, Guitar Hero World Tour is facing some drum issues, as some other hosts so viciously described.

849
00:50:26,129 --> 00:50:27,510
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some issues with the drums.

850
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,771
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sensing the hits.

851
00:50:32,413 --> 00:50:33,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's to come later.

852
00:50:34,014 --> 00:50:34,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Ignore that.

853
00:50:36,374 --> 00:50:37,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I let the audio run too long again.

854
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:38,235
[SPEAKER_07]: My bad.

855
00:50:38,675 --> 00:50:39,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Shame, shame.

856
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:40,936
[SPEAKER_05]: The fucking drums aren't fucking working right.

857
00:50:41,396 --> 00:50:43,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, so the drums aren't working correctly.

858
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:49,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, they're either not sensing hits or they're just plain not doing anything.

859
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,159
[SPEAKER_05]: They're faulty like this show.

860
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:52,560
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very faulty.

861
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, personally, I kind of called that they were faulty, but for whole different reasons.

862
00:50:58,482 --> 00:51:05,264
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the thing looks like it's made out of PVC and was seriously like rocking when people were playing it and not rocking in the good way.

863
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:07,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

864
00:51:09,628 --> 00:51:18,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as Bobby Blackwolf put it on his show, if they're going to brag that their instruments are better than rock band's instruments, then maybe they should work.

865
00:51:20,117 --> 00:51:21,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with the working first.

866
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:27,103
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only sound my guitar hero drums will make.

867
00:51:27,303 --> 00:51:29,645
[SPEAKER_22]: I have pumpkin-y goodness in me, by the way, Rob.

868
00:51:29,805 --> 00:51:30,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

869
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:30,746
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

870
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:32,887
[SPEAKER_07]: We're eating pumpkin bagels here in studio, just so you know.

871
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:33,628
[SPEAKER_03]: We are?

872
00:51:34,469 --> 00:51:34,669
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

873
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:36,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's fine.

874
00:51:36,155 --> 00:51:37,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, eat that Halloween candy.

875
00:51:37,896 --> 00:51:39,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't have the candy, and John doesn't want it.

876
00:51:40,376 --> 00:51:41,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So bring the thing out here.

877
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:42,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Make everybody eat it.

878
00:51:42,877 --> 00:51:43,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Give some to Justin TV.

879
00:51:43,857 --> 00:51:44,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

880
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:45,077
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

881
00:51:45,137 --> 00:51:47,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, big news this week.

882
00:51:47,298 --> 00:51:47,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.

883
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:53,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge news about something we here at Orange Lounge Radio used to cover every year and then kind of stopped.

884
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,940
[SPEAKER_07]: E3 is coming back.

885
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,400
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

886
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:03,122
[SPEAKER_07]: E3 2009 is coming back the way we know it, not this whole, like, scaled-down show we had.

887
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:03,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know that.

888
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

889
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:17,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, E3 is going to be just like it was before.

890
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:20,340
[SPEAKER_07]: However, that doesn't mean that anybody is going to be able to get in.

891
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not public.

892
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,341
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, it's going to be back to the same audience.

893
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:24,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.

894
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:27,742
[SPEAKER_05]: When it was originally going on anyways, it was almost public.

895
00:52:27,782 --> 00:52:36,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I work at Walmart or I know someone that works at Walmart in the garden department because they, you know, it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or something like that.

896
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:36,624
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like...

897
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:42,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I work in a store that looks at video games, and therefore, you know, I should be able to go.

898
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:44,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a crappy podcast on the internet that's been going for six years.

899
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:45,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to go.

900
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:46,049
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

901
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:49,992
[SPEAKER_22]: This means that we need to get our business stuff set back up.

902
00:52:50,132 --> 00:52:51,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we gotta go.

903
00:52:51,472 --> 00:52:51,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going.

904
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:52,893
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fun.

905
00:52:52,913 --> 00:52:54,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's gonna be tough.

906
00:52:54,654 --> 00:52:58,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna try to get the wife to let me go, but, uh... Ooh, ouch.

907
00:52:58,457 --> 00:52:59,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell her Fable 3 will be there.

908
00:52:59,337 --> 00:53:00,578
[SPEAKER_22]: This is how it works at my house.

909
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:01,959
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, Dan, I'm going to E3.

910
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you can do that.

911
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:07,017
[SPEAKER_22]: He can come with me.

912
00:53:08,038 --> 00:53:08,778
[SPEAKER_07]: That's his thing.

913
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,099
[SPEAKER_22]: He's come with me every year.

914
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:11,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Drag the intern.

915
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:25,769
[SPEAKER_07]: The website Joystick, that's Joystick with a Q, actually interviewed the president of the ESA, Doug Lowenstein, and he actually said, they asked him, if you had to give E3 a six-letter word or less tagline, what would it be?

916
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:30,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry, Doug Lowenstein was the former president of the ESA.

917
00:53:30,852 --> 00:53:31,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's Mike Gallagher.

918
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:33,264
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

919
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:03,434
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was an industry-only thing, it still was going down the tubes.

920
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:10,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had better things like, I don't know, Leipzig and PAX as the true gamers' conventions.

921
00:54:11,336 --> 00:54:14,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even for the industry, it's just not that good anymore.

922
00:54:14,977 --> 00:54:16,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of curious what effect this is going to have on PAX.

923
00:54:17,618 --> 00:54:21,559
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's going to cause less people to want to go to PAX now because they'll want to use their vacation on E3.

924
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:24,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Because not everybody can take vacation all the time, you know what I mean?

925
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,621
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, if I had to choose between the two, though, to be perfectly honest...

926
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:29,662
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to go to PAX again.

927
00:54:29,902 --> 00:54:30,942
[SPEAKER_22]: I really want to go to PAX again.

928
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:32,403
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, PAX was a lot of fun.

929
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:35,284
[SPEAKER_07]: PAX was more of like the gamer show, but I'm a greedy bastard.

930
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:36,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to both.

931
00:54:36,065 --> 00:54:36,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

932
00:54:36,405 --> 00:54:37,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no, I'd love to go to both.

933
00:54:37,905 --> 00:54:42,688
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd especially like to see what this E3 revival is, you know?

934
00:54:43,188 --> 00:54:46,750
[SPEAKER_22]: But if I had to pick between one or the other, I would pick PAX.

935
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,190
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there you go.

936
00:54:49,491 --> 00:54:52,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So Orange Lounge Radio, live from E3 this June.

937
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:55,534
[SPEAKER_22]: However, if we do go to E3, we're totally freaking going to Disneyland.

938
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,270
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see what we can do.

939
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:57,931
[SPEAKER_22]: We are.

940
00:54:58,871 --> 00:54:59,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, ma'am.

941
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:02,593
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's during the summer.

942
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:03,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So what?

943
00:55:03,873 --> 00:55:04,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Teacups.

944
00:55:05,274 --> 00:55:08,075
[SPEAKER_22]: Teacups for the win and California Screamin'.

945
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:10,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on with the news or we'll never get to Disneyland.

946
00:55:11,197 --> 00:55:14,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Disneyland could use more of?

947
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:15,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Zombies.

948
00:55:16,499 --> 00:55:18,160
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Call of Duty is getting more of?

949
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell about my story.

950
00:55:20,681 --> 00:55:21,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm sorry.

951
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:23,322
[SPEAKER_05]: You were just talking about Disneyland and I stopped listening.

952
00:55:25,123 --> 00:55:25,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

953
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:30,586
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, with E3's revival, what happens to E for All?

954
00:55:31,246 --> 00:55:33,068
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets flushed down the toilet!

955
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:36,152
[SPEAKER_22]: Whee!

956
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:39,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a toilet flush noise, sorry.

957
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:43,541
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, there's no more E for All, and I'm laughing my ass off.

958
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:43,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

959
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:44,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Why all the negativity?

960
00:55:44,822 --> 00:55:46,304
[SPEAKER_07]: There's too much cynicism in here tonight.

961
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:47,546
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

962
00:55:59,775 --> 00:56:00,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you, I'm going to PAX.

963
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:38,164
[SPEAKER_07]: it was pretty cool plus I got to meet Jonathan Colton and Will Wheaton and I couldn't do that at E for All Janai in chat makes the mandatory joke here that I think is pretty clever E for End did you hear that one Jamie?

964
00:56:40,205 --> 00:56:54,288
[SPEAKER_22]: E for End aww that's perfect I was telling Mel about Will Wheaton signing my iPhone and it rubbing off by the end of the day but you saw it I did see it I said now my phone is an extra limited edition and so he put a 1 slash 1 on it that was pretty funny

965
00:56:56,843 --> 00:56:58,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, now we can talk about zombies.

966
00:56:58,824 --> 00:57:00,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what you're going to see at E3 this year.

967
00:57:00,904 --> 00:57:02,925
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of unshowered, unslept zombies.

968
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:04,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

969
00:57:04,846 --> 00:57:07,667
[SPEAKER_22]: We should hand out care packs.

970
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:10,828
[SPEAKER_22]: We should hand out con care packs like they did at AX that one year.

971
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:12,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Where they handed out deodorant and soap.

972
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:17,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but unless you're going to put it on them yourself, it's not going to do any good.

973
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,411
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this?

974
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:20,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Cans of Axe.

975
00:57:20,672 --> 00:57:22,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Axe smells freaking good.

976
00:57:23,052 --> 00:57:24,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Axe is better than Confunk.

977
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:28,984
[SPEAKER_22]: Confunk is... Confunk is... No, no, no, no, no, no.

978
00:57:29,504 --> 00:57:31,064
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what smells better than Confunk?

979
00:57:31,544 --> 00:57:32,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Cat piss.

980
00:57:33,224 --> 00:57:34,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take your word for it.

981
00:57:34,225 --> 00:57:34,965
[SPEAKER_05]: How about zombies?

982
00:57:35,745 --> 00:57:36,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, zombies.

983
00:57:36,545 --> 00:57:46,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the megaton bomb that was dropped by GameTrailersTV was that Call of Duty World of War is going to feature a four-player co-op zombie mode.

984
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:52,248
[SPEAKER_05]: That totally doesn't rip off of another game that's very similar having a four-player co-op zombie mode in it.

985
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:53,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Left 4 Dead.

986
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:58,155
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess, hey, they want to make sure that people know that their game has zombies too.

987
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:02,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's so World of War.

988
00:58:02,298 --> 00:58:04,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the zombie wars back in World War II.

989
00:58:05,421 --> 00:58:08,944
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandpa used to tell me all about those, how the zombies would attack and everything.

990
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:12,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, yes, the zombies.

991
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:16,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank goodness that we defeated them and showed them democracy.

992
00:58:17,311 --> 00:58:19,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Democracy, bring it to the rest of the world.

993
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: and no zombies, because zombies are bad.

994
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:32,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But thankfully, though, Treyarch is able to come back and tell the lost battles of zombies, the part that was left out of the history books.

995
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:34,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Conspiracy, I say!

996
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Brains or no brains?

997
00:59:05,143 --> 00:59:09,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I do have to say, there's something that completely bothers me about zombie games.

998
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:10,929
[SPEAKER_22]: About games with zombies in them.

999
00:59:11,529 --> 00:59:13,211
[SPEAKER_22]: How you don't have a stench meter.

1000
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:22,299
[SPEAKER_22]: In zombie movies, in zombie games, why is it that you can't tell where the fucking zombies are by how much their decayed asses stink?

1001
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Their decaying bodies are gonna smell like rotten meat.

1002
00:59:26,704 --> 00:59:28,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe someday there'll be a smell-o-vision.

1003
00:59:29,744 --> 00:59:36,427
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, nobody in zombie movies are so surprised that the zombies are there when they should have been able to freaking smell corpse in a stench.

1004
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, you have games like, I don't know, Thief with sound meters.

1005
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:41,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't you have smell meters?

1006
00:59:41,028 --> 00:59:47,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe there's a lot of zombies and so because they all smell like rotting flesh, the whole place smells like rotting flesh so you can't tell where it's coming from.

1007
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:51,892
[SPEAKER_22]: It should still be stronger the closer you get to that much contained stench.

1008
00:59:52,132 --> 00:59:53,613
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like an anime con.

1009
00:59:53,993 --> 00:59:54,993
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like last night.

1010
00:59:55,013 --> 00:59:58,935
[SPEAKER_22]: You can tell when you're getting close to the dealer's room by the stink.

1011
00:59:59,335 --> 01:00:00,155
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

1012
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:03,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell when you're getting close to the cosplay competition.

1013
01:00:03,836 --> 01:00:05,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a Dave Matthews band concert.

1014
01:00:05,817 --> 01:00:08,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You can tell when you're getting close to the smell of marijuana.

1015
01:00:09,618 --> 01:00:15,300
[SPEAKER_22]: No, when you're getting close to the cosplay competition is when you stop smelling funk and start smelling other things.

1016
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:20,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you heard, Drew, but the Grateful Dead, the one guy's keeping on trucking in heaven.

1017
01:00:20,941 --> 01:00:21,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1018
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:22,722
[SPEAKER_07]: He's gratefully dead.

1019
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow... Unless he's a zombie!

1020
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:30,505
[SPEAKER_05]: In which case, you need to know how to defeat zombies by playing this game.

1021
01:00:31,226 --> 01:00:34,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Left 4 Dead, or Saints Row 2, or any other zombie game.

1022
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,712
[SPEAKER_07]: World of Warcraft, which has also started the zombie invasion.

1023
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:38,213
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1024
01:00:38,773 --> 01:00:42,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Zombie invasion has been hitting World of Warcraft, and there's been just craziness going on.

1025
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:45,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Earlier in the week, there was infections going on.

1026
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,602
[SPEAKER_07]: If you would kill an infected critter, or...

1027
01:00:48,803 --> 01:00:53,824
[SPEAKER_07]: or the like, you would get turned into a zombie in 10 minutes, and then you could create other zombies, and it was like a disease that was spread around.

1028
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:58,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as the week's been going on, now it takes 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.

1029
01:00:58,146 --> 01:00:58,486
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 seconds?

1030
01:00:58,666 --> 01:00:59,346
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one minute.

1031
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,786
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that happened to me earlier today.

1032
01:01:00,826 --> 01:01:02,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.

1033
01:01:02,507 --> 01:01:06,128
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you get hit by zombies, the faster they shave off times.

1034
01:01:06,408 --> 01:01:10,569
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to visit an Argent healer if they haven't been turned into a zombie.

1035
01:01:10,689 --> 01:01:13,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you have a priest or a paladin remove the disease.

1036
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:20,993
[SPEAKER_03]: All last night I was going on my priest through Orgrimmar making sure all the auction house dealers were clean.

1037
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently they don't like the people who are cleaning up after the zombies.

1038
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,981
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like the priests.

1039
01:01:41,021 --> 01:01:41,941
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like the pallies.

1040
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:43,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're ruining our fun.

1041
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you guys are going to low-level zones and killing everything.

1042
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:55,347
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, does anyone find this slightly offensive that there's people walking around into, I don't know, public buildings and exploding?

1043
01:01:55,827 --> 01:01:56,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

1044
01:01:56,627 --> 01:01:57,428
[SPEAKER_05]: There's zombies.

1045
01:01:57,648 --> 01:01:58,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't blame them, there are zombies.

1046
01:01:59,569 --> 01:02:03,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is okay when it's zombies and green blood, because it's not real.

1047
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:04,934
[SPEAKER_03]: There were zombies that ate too many Twinkies.

1048
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:08,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So if some zombies flew a plane into a building, that would be okay too?

1049
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:09,457
[SPEAKER_05]: There's zombies!

1050
01:02:11,926 --> 01:02:12,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just checking.

1051
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:13,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1052
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is the World of Warcraft game that you're playing.

1053
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:16,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1054
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:17,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see any recalls on that.

1055
01:02:17,689 --> 01:02:17,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1056
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:18,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1057
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:24,813
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have people getting infected and then flying to other cities and then exploding when they got there.

1058
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,114
[SPEAKER_03]: They zombified in mid-flight.

1059
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:28,555
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't explode in mid-flight?

1060
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:30,975
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't explode in mid-flight, but they can explode as soon as they land.

1061
01:02:31,295 --> 01:02:34,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Tenris Murkblood is a new boss that you can fight in Karazhan.

1062
01:02:34,136 --> 01:02:36,637
[SPEAKER_07]: My guild just took him down today, and it was actually a fun fight.

1063
01:02:36,917 --> 01:02:44,480
[SPEAKER_07]: But only you're going to be able to see him for 10 days, which basically means if you don't play him tonight or Monday, you have one chance because of the resets in Kara.

1064
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:47,361
[SPEAKER_07]: So he drops an axe that is awesome.

1065
01:02:47,401 --> 01:02:48,581
[SPEAKER_07]: He will drop this axe every time.

1066
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:53,863
[SPEAKER_07]: He only drops two things, a little bat pet for everybody in the raid, and an axe.

1067
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:54,783
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

1068
01:03:14,818 --> 01:03:16,240
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Link Grand Theft Auto 4 Zombies

1069
01:03:32,626 --> 01:03:39,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about non-news, but they decided, hey, we're going to jump in on the zombie fun as well, even though this has been around forever.

1070
01:03:39,555 --> 01:03:43,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to point out, since we just started tonight's show, a new phase just kicked in.

1071
01:03:43,781 --> 01:03:46,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Phase 5.5 just started tonight as we went live.

1072
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:47,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit.

1073
01:03:47,345 --> 01:04:14,126
[SPEAKER_07]: apparently what's happened now there are quests all of a sudden available in the main cities that send you to the faction leader and at some point you are going to be whispered by some type of either a frozen shade or a plagued brain that's going to be taunting you to join their forces and there's some type of quest going on to hopefully clean the world of the plague interesting so it's all going on right now in the world of Warcraft bathroom bathroom

1074
01:04:16,926 --> 01:04:17,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Brains David Hasselhoff

1075
01:04:38,494 --> 01:04:44,119
[SPEAKER_22]: And, um, he, uh, he actually thinks that it's completely, he actually said that it was hysterical.

1076
01:04:44,299 --> 01:04:45,320
[SPEAKER_22]: He's quoted as saying that.

1077
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:50,285
[SPEAKER_22]: And that, um, he thinks that, uh, it's really great that he gets to be in it.

1078
01:04:50,685 --> 01:04:53,928
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's also, um, his version of Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?

1079
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:59,253
[SPEAKER_22]: As, uh, the, uh, title to an in-game track.

1080
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,013
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that's pretty funny.

1081
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:01,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, you know, that's just, uh...

1082
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:04,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob's computer farted.

1083
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:08,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hello Rice Princess, glad to see you just arrived.

1084
01:05:25,273 --> 01:05:29,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I want to point out there's a new song available in Pain.

1085
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:33,501
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me.

1086
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:38,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me.

1087
01:05:44,471 --> 01:05:45,172
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't resist.

1088
01:05:45,192 --> 01:05:47,893
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta love a guy that actually is famous for doing that shit.

1089
01:05:47,913 --> 01:05:50,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously, you know what?

1090
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:55,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if he's just like, what can I do that's so ridiculous that people would still like me?

1091
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:58,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And he keeps making these songs and he's like, okay, people gotta hate me now.

1092
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:04,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're still buying his albums and he's still rich and putting them on TV shows and stuff.

1093
01:06:05,042 --> 01:06:05,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1094
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:11,526
[SPEAKER_23]: He's still convinced that he's instrumental in the Berlin Wall coming down.

1095
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:15,514
[SPEAKER_22]: They love him in Germany.

1096
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:17,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Ranma in chat says, I actually like this song.

1097
01:06:18,576 --> 01:06:21,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I only read that so that our, you know, thousands of listeners could hear that.

1098
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:24,381
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Ranma, R-A-N-M-A, likes that song.

1099
01:06:25,102 --> 01:06:27,964
[SPEAKER_07]: DSSJ100 Matt says, we got half rolled.

1100
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:29,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you did.

1101
01:06:30,046 --> 01:06:30,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you did.

1102
01:06:31,107 --> 01:06:34,810
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, a little more gaming news than the Classic Game of the Week and then a break.

1103
01:06:35,677 --> 01:06:42,838
[SPEAKER_05]: If you bought Rock Band 2, you'll know that on the back of your manual, it says you can get 20 free tracks available at a later date.

1104
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:47,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that later date is now November 4th, and there are 20 different tracks you can get.

1105
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:51,740
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, I don't know any of these artists at all.

1106
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,360
[SPEAKER_05]: So, real quickly, I'm going to read them off.

1107
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,181
[SPEAKER_05]: The 88, Sons and Daughters.

1108
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:58,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Authority Zero, No Regrets.

1109
01:06:59,401 --> 01:07:03,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Between the Buried and Me, Prepare to the Sequel.

1110
01:07:04,302 --> 01:07:32,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cab with Bounce, The Chevelles, Get It On, The Cocktail Slippers, Give It To Me, Dealership with Database Corrupted, End Ever After with I Wanna Be Your Man, The Ghost Towns, Ashes to Fire, Hollywood Undead, Young, The Cutlass, The Feeling, The Lend Price 3, If I Ain't Got You, Leslie Roy, I'm Gone, I'm Going,

1111
01:07:33,334 --> 01:07:44,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Opiate for the masses, Burn You Down, Semi-Precious Weapons, Magnetic Baby, Shamius with Like a Fool, Magnetic Baby?

1112
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:45,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1113
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:56,724
[SPEAKER_05]: TheNuno2, Crazy Tuesday, TickleMePink with The Time Is Wrong, Under Oath with Desperate Times, Desperate Measures, and X Japan with Ivy.

1114
01:07:57,525 --> 01:07:58,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

1115
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea of any of those songs, but hey.

1116
01:08:00,427 --> 01:08:04,290
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that actually we were really excited about getting some X Japan.

1117
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, at least they're free, and free is awesome.

1118
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:07,931
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1119
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:08,511
[SPEAKER_07]: No bitching.

1120
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:08,951
[SPEAKER_07]: It's free.

1121
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And there might be some cool songs in there that you've never heard of before.

1122
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:14,473
[SPEAKER_05]: So make sure that you register before the 4th.

1123
01:08:14,513 --> 01:08:26,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you probably can afterwards, but if you want to make sure you get it day one, register at rockband.com slash bonustracks, and they will send you an email with your code to download them once they become available.

1124
01:08:27,674 --> 01:08:29,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Kiss Them For Me, and Killing Jar

1125
01:08:46,454 --> 01:08:50,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all by Suzy and the Banshees, which is like one of the greatest bands ever.

1126
01:08:51,217 --> 01:08:57,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Dammit by Blink-182, that song that Rob was talking about the little girl singing earlier in SingStar.

1127
01:08:58,723 --> 01:08:59,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

1128
01:08:59,383 --> 01:09:04,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like Metal Onan by the Silver Sun Pickups.

1129
01:09:05,968 --> 01:09:09,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Well Thought Out Twinkies by, or Twinkles.

1130
01:09:10,031 --> 01:09:10,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Twinkies would be funny though.

1131
01:09:11,292 --> 01:09:15,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Well Thought Out Twinkles by Silver Sun Pickups and Pretty in Pink by Psychedelic Furs.

1132
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:17,349
[SPEAKER_22]: That's cool.

1133
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:18,130
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

1134
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:18,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares?

1135
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:21,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it has Suzy and the Banshees in it, so all the rest of that is just crap.

1136
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:29,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, Rob, are you straight now?

1137
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,161
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just love Suzy and the Banshees.

1138
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:33,701
[SPEAKER_07]: They're awesome.

1139
01:09:33,901 --> 01:09:35,543
[SPEAKER_22]: She was on the Basement Jack song, too.

1140
01:09:35,563 --> 01:09:38,905
[SPEAKER_22]: They had a really cool video on top of it.

1141
01:09:40,186 --> 01:09:40,606
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1142
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:41,447
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Kish Cash.

1143
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:49,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny, my band right now, thankfully, because I'm not playing Rock Band 2, but my friend is on my account, so it counts.

1144
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:51,593
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're in the top 600 now.

1145
01:09:52,673 --> 01:09:53,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1146
01:09:53,994 --> 01:09:54,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.

1147
01:09:55,074 --> 01:09:55,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know.

1148
01:09:56,154 --> 01:09:58,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very pleased at my progress in the game.

1149
01:09:59,174 --> 01:10:03,257
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, just to let people know, our band name at my house is Detachable Penis.

1150
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Like the King Missile song.

1151
01:10:05,239 --> 01:10:06,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Did it not get banned?

1152
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:06,840
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1153
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:07,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

1154
01:10:09,101 --> 01:10:11,523
[SPEAKER_07]: The one I've been playing in mostly is actually Shane's band.

1155
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:12,524
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Emergency Kittens.

1156
01:10:13,444 --> 01:10:14,225
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the name of our band.

1157
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:15,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the Sassy Squad sing backup?

1158
01:10:16,206 --> 01:10:16,446
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1159
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a Warcraft.

1160
01:10:18,328 --> 01:10:20,950
[SPEAKER_11]: But is Fluffles Chainset III the lead singer?

1161
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:21,170
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1162
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:21,290
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1163
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:29,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, hey, by the way, if you want a real band game, you know, the hell with Rock Band or Guitar Hero, get Rock Revolution.

1164
01:10:29,844 --> 01:10:30,244
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1165
01:10:30,264 --> 01:10:31,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just so kidding.

1166
01:10:31,525 --> 01:10:32,345
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you want this.

1167
01:10:32,966 --> 01:10:37,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Strong Bad Episode 3, the baddest of the bands, is coming out.

1168
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,388
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Episode 3.

1169
01:10:38,629 --> 01:10:40,329
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes out on the PC and WiiWare.

1170
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:40,850
[SPEAKER_07]: When?

1171
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:41,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now.

1172
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:43,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Monday, for those of you listening live.

1173
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:44,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It's tomorrow.

1174
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:45,672
[SPEAKER_07]: October 27th.

1175
01:10:45,732 --> 01:10:48,193
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be, as always, 1,000 Wii Points or $10.

1176
01:10:48,274 --> 01:10:50,695
[SPEAKER_07]: That's coming out from Telltale Games.

1177
01:10:51,909 --> 01:10:52,369
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

1178
01:10:52,389 --> 01:10:55,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Those of you that are enjoying the Strong Bad games probably want to pick that up.

1179
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you haven't picked up a Strong Bad game yet, you might want to do that.

1180
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:02,732
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, I'm talking to myself because I still have not played the Strong Bad series.

1181
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:03,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I really need to.

1182
01:11:03,972 --> 01:11:05,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the ban over, Rob?

1183
01:11:05,853 --> 01:11:07,233
[SPEAKER_22]: No, you know your boycott's not over yet.

1184
01:11:07,293 --> 01:11:08,274
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I can play it on PC.

1185
01:11:08,834 --> 01:11:09,294
[SPEAKER_22]: That's right.

1186
01:11:09,534 --> 01:11:10,394
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I plan to do.

1187
01:11:10,674 --> 01:11:12,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, your boycott because your memory's full.

1188
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:15,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm boycotting the Wii download stuff.

1189
01:11:15,247 --> 01:11:16,927
[SPEAKER_07]: But although, well, I don't know.

1190
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:19,948
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm iffy on it because they have announced the remedy for it.

1191
01:11:20,628 --> 01:11:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, have you already announced that on the show, what the remedy is?

1192
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:26,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they did announce they are going to let you run things off SD cards.

1193
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:27,970
[SPEAKER_07]: But when's that happening, though?

1194
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:28,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1195
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,871
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be a patch, right?

1196
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:30,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, probably a patch.

1197
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:35,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyhow, hey, we're not even halfway done with this show yet, if you can believe it.

1198
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:46,618
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take a break here pretty soon, but first, we always like to end Part A of our program by taking a trip to the past and revisiting the archives and trying to pick out a classic game of the week.

1199
01:11:46,999 --> 01:11:54,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, as I understand, though, tonight's game, because it is Episode 300, DarkSakura had to pick, like, a fucking epic classic.

1200
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:55,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

1201
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:55,962
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure did.

1202
01:11:56,162 --> 01:11:57,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well, let's get to it.

1203
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:04,754
[SPEAKER_22]: My classic game, actually I'm not going to say the title of it to begin with.

1204
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,236
[SPEAKER_22]: It should begin with the intro to the game.

1205
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:11,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Which everyone will get from the first tones.

1206
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:14,922
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm getting grins from over here looking at my laptop.

1207
01:12:16,183 --> 01:12:16,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1208
01:12:18,224 --> 01:12:18,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1209
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:35,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah!

1210
01:12:35,264 --> 01:12:36,805
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we get it yet, kids?

1211
01:12:37,526 --> 01:12:38,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah!

1212
01:12:38,867 --> 01:12:40,328
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's not Castlevania!

1213
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:42,849
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Guts Man!

1214
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:45,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah!

1215
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:48,133
[SPEAKER_22]: Tora is the first person to guess.

1216
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:49,774
[SPEAKER_22]: And stop spamming the room now, please.

1217
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:51,475
[SPEAKER_22]: You get a no prize!

1218
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:52,916
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop it!

1219
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:54,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, someone kick Tora out of the chat room, please.

1220
01:12:56,699 --> 01:12:57,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Right the fuck now.

1221
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you read about the classic game now?

1222
01:13:00,262 --> 01:13:00,923
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1223
01:13:01,763 --> 01:13:02,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1224
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:07,865
[SPEAKER_22]: The classic game is Final Fantasy VI, which we got over here on Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy III.

1225
01:13:08,285 --> 01:13:10,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Play the best music in the game ever, please.

1226
01:13:13,006 --> 01:13:15,807
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the overworld music, which is also called Terra's Theme.

1227
01:13:16,427 --> 01:13:18,088
[SPEAKER_22]: Although in the Japanese version, her name was Tina.

1228
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:25,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Best music in the game.

1229
01:13:25,573 --> 01:13:25,833
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1230
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:28,016
[SPEAKER_22]: That's just my own opinion.

1231
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,159
[SPEAKER_22]: And Sauce's best game ever.

1232
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:33,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is probably one of the best video game songs ever.

1233
01:13:33,504 --> 01:13:33,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Period.

1234
01:13:33,845 --> 01:13:37,791
[SPEAKER_22]: This game is the reason why I skipped a week of high school.

1235
01:13:39,423 --> 01:13:41,804
[SPEAKER_22]: While I had the flu, but that's beside the point.

1236
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:43,505
[SPEAKER_22]: My flu was prolonged.

1237
01:13:43,906 --> 01:13:50,009
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, I started off having the flu, and my grandma rented the game for me, and I ended up just having the flu a little bit longer than I really did.

1238
01:13:50,589 --> 01:13:59,955
[SPEAKER_22]: But the one thing about this one is it was the first in the series that was not done by Sakaguchi, it was done by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito.

1239
01:14:01,215 --> 01:14:07,339
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is considered pretty much the pinnacle of it, although I really, really like Final Fantasy V a whole lot, too.

1240
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:37,562
[SPEAKER_22]: um it has the largest playable cast of any Final Fantasy game to date so um pretty much it's it's standard Final Fantasy you know you have your overworld map and you have your dungeons and you have your towns and um you've got your chocobo and you have your airship and random encounters on land um this one also has um your espers which are you know give you your magic and you keep improving and

1241
01:14:39,124 --> 01:14:40,665
[SPEAKER_22]: and it's still menu-based combat.

1242
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:43,388
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's Final Fantasy, basically.

1243
01:14:43,408 --> 01:14:58,122
[SPEAKER_22]: There were a few different innovative attacks, like Sully's had the runic attack, which could reflect magical attacks back at somebody, although I'll be honest, I rarely ever freaking use that, except for that one battle where you had to.

1244
01:14:59,103 --> 01:15:02,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and I'm actually still playing this right now too.

1245
01:15:03,067 --> 01:15:15,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, but this has, um, for the active time battle system, you actually can pick any character that has filled up their action bar and you don't have to pick the first one that pops up.

1246
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:21,185
[SPEAKER_22]: You can actually change out which one you want to use as long as their bar is, is their first.

1247
01:15:21,205 --> 01:15:21,245
[SPEAKER_22]: Um,

1248
01:15:22,566 --> 01:15:42,677
[SPEAKER_22]: and this actually was incorporated into later ones you could customize your characters by your relics to change their stats you could you know work with their spells a little bit you could equip their magicite which is like I was saying is basically some of the espers helps with magic they have the magic acquisition points for each time you gain a

1249
01:15:43,257 --> 01:15:44,378
[SPEAKER_22]: AP as you level up.

1250
01:15:45,159 --> 01:15:59,492
[SPEAKER_22]: This particular game is where basically you've got this one girl named Tara in the Japanese version, it was Tina, and they find her and she can do magic and everyone's like, oh my god, magic!

1251
01:15:59,552 --> 01:16:00,173
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna barf!

1252
01:16:00,993 --> 01:16:02,415
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the rest of the story goes off.

1253
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:08,360
[SPEAKER_22]: This also has Kefka, which is the most annoying...

1254
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:13,065
[SPEAKER_22]: laugh in a video game ever.

1255
01:16:14,287 --> 01:16:16,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody poison the water hole.

1256
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:20,714
[SPEAKER_03]: But he had the best boss theme ever.

1257
01:16:21,935 --> 01:16:23,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I really like Jenova's better, but anyway.

1258
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:24,859
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

1259
01:16:26,509 --> 01:16:30,450
[SPEAKER_22]: The one other really cool thing that I thought about this game is that it's very steampunk.

1260
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:31,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Really, it is.

1261
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:37,252
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you've got steam-powered mecha in the game.

1262
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:38,992
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all very early industrial.

1263
01:16:39,112 --> 01:16:40,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Magitek.

1264
01:16:40,573 --> 01:16:41,613
[SPEAKER_22]: You have your Magitek armor.

1265
01:16:42,013 --> 01:16:50,295
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got, you know, the Empire in that is pretty much a magical, industrial-type mesh.

1266
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:51,235
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, it's so fantastic.

1267
01:16:51,255 --> 01:16:52,036
[SPEAKER_22]: And you have toilets in it.

1268
01:16:52,056 --> 01:16:52,756
[SPEAKER_22]: You can use the toilet.

1269
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:53,216
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you know that?

1270
01:16:54,205 --> 01:16:55,406
[SPEAKER_11]: What if you don't use the toilet?

1271
01:16:55,426 --> 01:16:57,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Because in Sims, that's not good.

1272
01:16:57,989 --> 01:16:58,189
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1273
01:16:58,549 --> 01:17:05,936
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're in the Empire Castle, whatever, and you're in one of the cells, you can actually sit on the toilet and squat down on it.

1274
01:17:06,437 --> 01:17:09,099
[SPEAKER_22]: And then when you hop off the toilet, it flushes.

1275
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:12,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they take down their little pants to do that?

1276
01:17:13,864 --> 01:17:14,024
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

1277
01:17:14,824 --> 01:17:15,605
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they have a trap door.

1278
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:16,165
[SPEAKER_11]: They do?

1279
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:17,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1280
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:20,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, Saw says it has the freakiest clown in a video game ever.

1281
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:23,752
[SPEAKER_22]: But you've got some of the best characters in this.

1282
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:32,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, you've got... I actually really liked... Go-Go.

1283
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:33,502
[SPEAKER_22]: I really liked Go-Go.

1284
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Because of the weird stuff he did.

1285
01:17:36,124 --> 01:17:38,366
[SPEAKER_22]: I loved Gal, who was the little...

1286
01:17:47,812 --> 01:17:50,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why we're having mic issues in the studio.

1287
01:17:50,616 --> 01:17:50,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it?

1288
01:17:51,097 --> 01:17:52,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep it away from the speakers.

1289
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:52,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1290
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,462
[SPEAKER_22]: But Rob, do me a favor and...

1291
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:56,818
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'll try to find it.

1292
01:17:56,938 --> 01:18:05,902
[SPEAKER_22]: But this game had the single most hardcore awesome character in it, which was... We'll get to him in a second.

1293
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:08,083
[SPEAKER_22]: But the main characters you have, Terra slash Tina.

1294
01:18:08,543 --> 01:18:10,423
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got Locke, who's your thief.

1295
01:18:10,503 --> 01:18:12,684
[SPEAKER_22]: You have Sillies, who's... Treasure Hunter.

1296
01:18:13,725 --> 01:18:14,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever.

1297
01:18:14,725 --> 01:18:18,667
[SPEAKER_22]: You have Sabin, who's your martial artist.

1298
01:18:18,687 --> 01:18:20,287
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a special rendition of it.

1299
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:20,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, wait.

1300
01:18:20,967 --> 01:18:21,428
[SPEAKER_07]: No, here we go.

1301
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:21,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1302
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:22,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Never mind.

1303
01:18:22,568 --> 01:18:22,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

1304
01:18:24,029 --> 01:18:24,709
[SPEAKER_22]: But here's the man.

1305
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:38,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Shadow the Ninja, who we used to call Snake Eyes.

1306
01:18:39,653 --> 01:18:42,675
[SPEAKER_22]: And you have, Realm was cool, she had the drawing attack.

1307
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:49,699
[SPEAKER_22]: And you had her grandfather, who's the Blue Mage, and you had What's-His-Face, who looked like Billy B. Williams.

1308
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:53,762
[SPEAKER_22]: Who was the Doma Castle guy.

1309
01:18:55,609 --> 01:18:56,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Cyan.

1310
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,369
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1311
01:18:56,609 --> 01:18:59,090
[SPEAKER_22]: But he looked like Billy... We used to call him Billy Dee.

1312
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, he looks like Billy Dee Williams.

1313
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,210
[SPEAKER_22]: He doesn't drink cold 45.

1314
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:02,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Edgar was the best.

1315
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:03,070
[SPEAKER_22]: I bet he does.

1316
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Edgar was awesome because it was all about the autocross bow.

1317
01:19:06,991 --> 01:19:07,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And the autocross bow.

1318
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:08,791
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chainsaw.

1319
01:19:09,131 --> 01:19:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chainsaw.

1320
01:19:10,171 --> 01:19:11,612
[SPEAKER_05]: The drill.

1321
01:19:11,772 --> 01:19:21,013
[SPEAKER_22]: The graphics actually were... The characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano and they were actually converted to sprite.

1322
01:19:21,993 --> 01:19:22,154
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

1323
01:19:27,071 --> 01:19:37,918
[SPEAKER_22]: There were also, in the PlayStation version that came out later, the actual videos that were in the game were directly from Amano's designs.

1324
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:38,818
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought it was pretty cool.

1325
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:50,045
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was one of the, it's not the first one that used Mode 7, but it used extensive Mode 7 in this for lots of scaling and scrolling.

1326
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:51,546
[SPEAKER_22]: It was really fantastic.

1327
01:19:52,227 --> 01:20:01,022
[SPEAKER_22]: When it was localized, there were changes like a little bit of nudity, for example.

1328
01:20:01,803 --> 01:20:04,228
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the painting bosses.

1329
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:05,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, one of those.

1330
01:20:07,941 --> 01:20:10,823
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, different characters for their full names.

1331
01:20:11,183 --> 01:20:15,607
[SPEAKER_22]: They romanized them differently so that they would fit a six-character slot.

1332
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:24,233
[SPEAKER_03]: They were also changed quite a bit from Terra to Tina, from Mash to Sabin, from Kyan to Cyan.

1333
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:33,065
[SPEAKER_22]: but I think that they picked it in the way that people would most be able to relate to it.

1334
01:20:34,465 --> 01:20:34,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Text.

1335
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:53,233
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of dialogue was shortened because, again, it could only store a certain number of characters and I'm sorry, Japanese lends itself a lot easier to extended conversation within a limited character allotment because it's syllabic and English isn't.

1336
01:20:55,474 --> 01:20:55,654
[SPEAKER_22]: This

1337
01:20:56,932 --> 01:20:57,614
[SPEAKER_22]: is so awesome.

1338
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:18,234
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the opera scene, which is, to this day, I think, one of the most memorable ever scenes in any video game ever.

1339
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:20,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It brings tears to most classic game shows.

1340
01:21:20,436 --> 01:21:21,156
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

1341
01:21:21,616 --> 01:21:32,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you see, I saw where they did for the Dear Friends concert, Rob, where they did the opera scene in Japanese.

1342
01:21:34,504 --> 01:21:35,384
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw YouTube of it.

1343
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:37,105
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just fantastic.

1344
01:21:37,225 --> 01:21:38,146
[SPEAKER_22]: It was so beautiful.

1345
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:47,130
[SPEAKER_22]: And here's actually one that we should realize about the music.

1346
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,791
[SPEAKER_22]: We've kept bringing up the music during this.

1347
01:21:48,891 --> 01:22:01,837
[SPEAKER_22]: It was actually done by Uematsu, who wrote all of the music in the game, did everything for every location, all the battles, different themes.

1348
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:06,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually use the music from the games in Japanese music classes in Japan.

1349
01:22:09,477 --> 01:22:23,003
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, they wanted to use an actual voice for the opera, but the SBC-700 chip would not allow an actual voice track, so that's why they used...

1350
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:36,258
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it would basically be the Vox Organa, or Vox Humana thing for organ, is what I recognize it as.

1351
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:45,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the sound chip itself didn't support the voices, but later on you had games like Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean that did have actual voice samples.

1352
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:47,581
[SPEAKER_22]: But we're talking about full vocal track.

1353
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:50,861
[SPEAKER_22]: It wouldn't support a full vocal track.

1354
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:53,022
[SPEAKER_22]: It would support something that was short.

1355
01:22:55,639 --> 01:22:57,541
[SPEAKER_07]: True enough.

1356
01:22:57,561 --> 01:22:59,602
[SPEAKER_07]: The Last Metroid is in captivity.

1357
01:23:00,123 --> 01:23:01,524
[SPEAKER_07]: The Galaxy is at peace.

1358
01:23:01,544 --> 01:23:02,705
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about as much as you can get.

1359
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,227
[SPEAKER_22]: Or the Clay Fighters opening.

1360
01:23:08,309 --> 01:23:19,737
[SPEAKER_22]: But for the Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale album, it actually was rearranged as an aria using an actual singer in full...

1361
01:23:21,678 --> 01:23:27,040
[SPEAKER_22]: Accompaniment, and this version was also in the full motion video in the PlayStation version, so it was pretty cool.

1362
01:23:29,481 --> 01:23:44,986
[SPEAKER_22]: You can actually get, I've got the full soundtrack to this, you can get all kinds of arranged versions, but there's also some pretty good versions of some of the music in the game in some of the Final Fantasy compilation discs.

1363
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:53,290
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I still think that the best of the compilation ones, which I don't think has any from this game in it, is still Celtic Moon.

1364
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:54,190
[SPEAKER_22]: And Prey.

1365
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:54,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Prey was very good.

1366
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:56,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Prey had some stuff in here.

1367
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:06,112
[SPEAKER_22]: We did, like I said, we got a PlayStation version, but there's also Final Fantasy VI Advance, which came out on DS.

1368
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:11,093
[SPEAKER_22]: There's four new espers in this one, which is Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactar, and Diabolos.

1369
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:12,774
[SPEAKER_22]: Cactar!

1370
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was on Game Boy Advance.

1371
01:24:15,495 --> 01:24:16,636
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, that's the Game Boy Advance one.

1372
01:24:17,076 --> 01:24:18,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish it was on DS, that'd be awesome.

1373
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:21,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well that's the one I've been playing through until my DS broke.

1374
01:24:23,618 --> 01:24:41,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, for this game, as of March 31st, 2003, it shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide, which is 2.6 million in Japan alone, and 860,000 overseas, and continued to be one of the best-selling games.

1375
01:24:41,906 --> 01:24:42,967
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1376
01:24:56,843 --> 01:25:23,779
[SPEAKER_22]: and this is what made me all hyper is that when I don't know if you remember when the Nintendo 64 was in production or sorry in testing they actually made a demonstration for the Nintendo 64 using the the cast from Final Fantasy 7 in a big battle I think versus Bahamut which I found video of finally and it's freaking crazy looking

1377
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is what we're looking at right now in studio.

1378
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:31,361
[SPEAKER_11]: It was going to be too expensive, right, to put it on a cartridge to do the game, right, for Final Fantasy VII?

1379
01:25:32,381 --> 01:25:37,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, basically, it was actually done on Silicon Graphics hardware when they first put it out.

1380
01:25:38,823 --> 01:25:45,204
[SPEAKER_22]: But Square hadn't yet committed, and the technology in the game was not up to their parts.

1381
01:25:45,244 --> 01:25:48,065
[SPEAKER_22]: They actually wanted to move it to PlayStation for the sake of full motion video.

1382
01:25:49,586 --> 01:26:03,221
[SPEAKER_22]: Which the PlayStation of course could easily handle But the demo actually had Terra, Locke, and Shadow And it was controlled actually through using a mouse

1383
01:26:04,182 --> 01:26:08,024
[SPEAKER_22]: instead of, you know, actual, like with a control.

1384
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:26,532
[SPEAKER_22]: There was also Final Fantasy VI, the interactive CG game, which was actually also called Final Fantasy X, not a Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X, which was the same demonstration, but with better textures.

1385
01:26:26,652 --> 01:26:28,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Not for the Philips CD-i, right?

1386
01:26:28,473 --> 01:26:28,693
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no.

1387
01:26:29,073 --> 01:26:33,095
[SPEAKER_11]: This was basically... We're going on an adventure, Zelda!

1388
01:26:33,675 --> 01:26:35,816
[SPEAKER_22]: But this was basically what they were using.

1389
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:45,482
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a sort of a touchdown version they were using for the Nintendo 64 demo test.

1390
01:26:45,922 --> 01:26:53,306
[SPEAKER_22]: But this was more to demonstrate the actual use of CG in the thing.

1391
01:26:53,326 --> 01:26:55,107
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's pretty cool.

1392
01:26:55,747 --> 01:26:59,770
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's our classic game is Final Fantasy VI.

1393
01:27:00,478 --> 01:27:01,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh good, because I was running out of music.

1394
01:27:01,879 --> 01:27:02,399
[SPEAKER_07]: That was long.

1395
01:27:02,439 --> 01:27:02,899
[SPEAKER_07]: That's alright.

1396
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:03,600
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worth it.

1397
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:04,841
[SPEAKER_07]: That game deserves it.

1398
01:27:05,281 --> 01:27:14,386
[SPEAKER_22]: I knew that this game would require a ton of attention, so how could we not dedicate more time to it?

1399
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:15,747
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's episode 300.

1400
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:17,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, hell, we have to pick the pinnacle.

1401
01:27:18,009 --> 01:27:18,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1402
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:20,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how you're going to follow that next week.

1403
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:21,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1404
01:27:21,531 --> 01:27:23,472
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it's not better than Super Metroid.

1405
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 6 Final Fantasy 5 Final Fantasy 6

1406
01:27:45,149 --> 01:27:50,736
[SPEAKER_22]: A whole lot, and I'll probably do that as a later game, because of how customizable the job change system was.

1407
01:27:51,036 --> 01:27:55,401
[SPEAKER_22]: And Final Fantasy 3 was the first one to do that, of the Japanese releases.

1408
01:27:55,822 --> 01:27:57,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Which was actually really fun, too.

1409
01:27:57,323 --> 01:27:59,166
[SPEAKER_22]: If anyone can find a translation of it, play it.

1410
01:27:59,206 --> 01:27:59,786
[SPEAKER_22]: It's fantastic.

1411
01:27:59,806 --> 01:28:00,868
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they've got it on DS.

1412
01:28:00,888 --> 01:28:02,369
[SPEAKER_22]: They have it now, but I mean like the old...

1413
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,530
[SPEAKER_22]: The old one.

1414
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:13,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Final Fantasy 6, I think, for storytelling, for just how drawn in it brings you into everything, for all the detail.

1415
01:28:13,517 --> 01:28:14,738
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, flushing toilets.

1416
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:16,899
[SPEAKER_22]: A first for any Final Fantasy game.

1417
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:22,943
[SPEAKER_11]: With the opera, by the time you get to the opera, there's like this epic, crazy stuff.

1418
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:26,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And so much has gone on already, and you're like, oh my god, this is some crazy adventure.

1419
01:28:27,246 --> 01:28:32,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Plus, it's all about the X-Zone.

1420
01:28:34,331 --> 01:28:39,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Vanish Doom Vanish Doom or Vanish X-Zone Both of them But it was all about that, hi

1421
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:50,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, we gotta wrap up or we're gonna have no time for Skype calls in Part B. We're gonna move on and take a break, but hey, don't go away.

1422
01:28:50,975 --> 01:28:58,818
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be plenty more of Orange Launch Radio, some more news coming in Part B. We've got a new technology Microsoft might be building so that people will stop swearing on Xbox Live.

1423
01:28:59,318 --> 01:29:01,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see what people have to say about this.

1424
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:01,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1425
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:01,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Aw, fuck.

1426
01:29:02,199 --> 01:29:02,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1427
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:07,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, we'll be talking about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1428
01:29:11,604 --> 01:29:17,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we have, for tonight's free break, your shout-outs from our voicemail.

1429
01:29:17,889 --> 01:29:18,349

[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:29:28,818 --> 01:29:29,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, all our crew.

[SPEAKER_14]: Happy 300th day.

1433
01:29:30,879 --> 01:29:33,562
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the turn of more albums of all our lessons for you, year 68.

1434
01:29:33,722 --> 01:29:34,042
[SPEAKER_14]: P.S.

1435
01:29:34,562 --> 01:29:39,987
[SPEAKER_14]: This voicemail is brought to you by the All Our Tavern, on the never-ending transport and DMN case.

1436
01:29:41,499 --> 01:29:42,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, hey, hey!

1437
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:43,500
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up?

1438
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:44,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan Shadow here.

1439
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:45,541
[SPEAKER_15]: So, 300.

1440
01:29:46,602 --> 01:29:47,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Episode 300.

1441
01:29:48,243 --> 01:29:48,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1442
01:29:48,743 --> 01:29:48,723
300.

1443
01:29:49,244 --> 01:29:50,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1444
01:29:51,105 --> 01:29:53,526
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't even get one.

1445
01:29:53,546 --> 01:29:54,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I get one?

1446
01:29:55,247 --> 01:29:55,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one.

1447
01:29:56,488 --> 01:29:56,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1448
01:29:56,788 --> 01:29:56,868
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

1449
01:29:56,888 --> 01:29:57,048
[SPEAKER_15]: But 300.

1450
01:29:57,088 --> 01:29:57,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, man.

1451
01:29:57,969 --> 01:29:58,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

1452
01:29:58,189 --> 01:29:58,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1453
01:29:58,309 --> 01:29:58,289
300.

1454
01:29:58,509 --> 01:29:58,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1455
01:29:58,649 --> 01:29:58,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1456
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:00,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1457
01:30:10,382 --> 01:30:13,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, hi, it's Gold Ampro.

1458
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:17,808
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't really left a message to talk to you guys for a while.

1459
01:30:17,948 --> 01:30:24,413
[SPEAKER_18]: And even though I'm probably going to be there, I'm probably not going to be there because of stupid school reasons.

1460
01:30:24,533 --> 01:30:29,437
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I hope you guys, the 300th episode is really good and I'll listen to it on the podcast.

1461
01:30:29,777 --> 01:30:33,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, real quickly, I want to tell my game spots to stop scoring.

1462
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, there's one for the whiteboard.

1463
01:30:36,242 --> 01:30:46,071
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to my mom a couple months ago, and what happened was, um, well, um, I got sent.

1464
01:30:46,811 --> 01:30:56,300
[SPEAKER_18]: We were waiting in line, and the lady was, we had to wait there 10 minutes, they were ignoring us, and we were at the front of the line at the counter.

1465
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,722
[SPEAKER_18]: And then they had to nerve-jack, um,

1466
01:31:00,802 --> 01:31:03,724
[SPEAKER_18]: In order to ask, do you want to buy an Edge card with that?

1467
01:31:03,744 --> 01:31:05,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's a 10% discount.

1468
01:31:05,386 --> 01:31:06,226
[SPEAKER_18]: And Mom's like, no.

1469
01:31:06,626 --> 01:31:07,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we walk out.

1470
01:31:07,927 --> 01:31:12,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, after making us wait for 10 minutes, we could tell they were pretty much deliberately ignoring us.

1471
01:31:13,712 --> 01:31:18,536
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I know today's busy, but, I mean, it's just so annoying.

1472
01:31:20,317 --> 01:31:25,361
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's one for the game's spot, stop, whatever, message board thing.

1473
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:26,742
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry it was a little over a minute.

1474
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,883
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up Orange Lounge Radio, this is Tire Claw.

1475
01:31:31,303 --> 01:31:34,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to congratulate you all for the 300th episode.

1476
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:38,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the good fight and take care, alright?

1477
01:31:38,308 --> 01:31:39,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, happy 300th!

1478
01:31:39,409 --> 01:31:42,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, how do you say it in French?

1479
01:31:42,611 --> 01:31:43,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Joyeux 300th!

1480
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:43,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well, hell.

1481
01:31:47,886 --> 01:31:52,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, hi there Olar, this is Aki Ripper just calling you to say Happy 300!

1482
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:55,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Eller Gratulerar på 300-programsdagen!

1483
01:31:59,144 --> 01:31:59,905
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Swedish.

1484
01:32:00,365 --> 01:32:01,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hello, hello.

1485
01:32:02,246 --> 01:32:04,348

1542
01:34:52,608 --> 01:34:57,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on it right now, but before I get to upload it, there's one thing we gotta do first.

[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna have a drink based on each one of them.

1559
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,696
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be some awesome fun tonight.

1560
01:35:35,216 --> 01:35:37,277
[SPEAKER_24]: You're gonna, like, be totally plastered.

1561
01:35:37,337 --> 01:35:38,158
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel bad for you.

1562
01:35:38,298 --> 01:35:39,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not gonna be plastered.

1563
01:35:39,319 --> 01:35:39,819

[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.

1567
01:35:43,682 --> 01:35:46,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Or... Hey, why don't, instead of arguing, why don't you come into the chatroom tonight?

1568
01:35:47,384 --> 01:35:47,865
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1569
01:35:48,772 --> 01:35:49,172
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll be fun.

1570
01:35:49,212 --> 01:35:49,973
[SPEAKER_24]: It depends.

1571
01:35:49,993 --> 01:35:51,395
[SPEAKER_24]: Definitely.

1572
01:35:51,875 --> 01:35:52,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1573
01:35:52,436 --> 01:35:58,421

1576
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:03,506
[SPEAKER_24]: A little bit excited.

1577
01:36:04,167 --> 01:36:04,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little bit?

1578
01:36:04,688 --> 01:36:05,829
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a little bit.

1579
01:36:06,209 --> 01:36:07,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, awesome.

[SPEAKER_19]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!

1583
01:36:22,802 --> 01:36:23,102
[SPEAKER_19]: Holler!

1584
01:36:23,142 --> 01:36:23,603

[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, everybody, to episode number 300 of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 26th, 2008.

1589
01:36:39,352 --> 01:36:56,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a reminder, there will be no show next week just due to the fact that, hey, we deserve a week off after 300 episodes and the fact that I'm having surgery and I'm being held up by Loki dressed as Sackboy, which you can see on our Justin TV feed at justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1590
01:36:57,299 --> 01:36:58,680
[SPEAKER_22]: This is orange-tipped gunny-o.

1591
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,403
[SPEAKER_07]: He's holding up the Justin listeners with a gun.

1592
01:37:01,423 --> 01:37:02,204
[SPEAKER_07]: That's lovely.

1593
01:37:02,244 --> 01:37:03,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Where did you get a gun?

1594
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:07,006
[SPEAKER_22]: It's his airsoft.

1595
01:37:07,266 --> 01:37:07,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1596
01:37:07,606 --> 01:37:08,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, where in the hell?

1597
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:09,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Who got you a gun?

1598
01:37:10,546 --> 01:37:12,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob, I have airsoft guns.

1599
01:37:12,447 --> 01:37:12,727
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1600
01:37:12,887 --> 01:37:14,827
[SPEAKER_22]: The little Resident Evil pistols.

1601
01:37:15,267 --> 01:37:15,627
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1602
01:37:16,527 --> 01:37:19,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I know we want to get to the Skype line.

1603
01:37:19,168 --> 01:37:20,608
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a lot of people who want to call in tonight.

1604
01:37:20,628 --> 01:37:22,229
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try and take as many calls as possible.

1605
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:23,869
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, we've got a little more news to get to.

1606
01:37:24,309 --> 01:37:25,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And Loki, you ready?

1607
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:26,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Situated there?

1608
01:37:26,109 --> 01:37:27,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready to get us back into some gaming news?

1609
01:37:27,490 --> 01:37:28,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course.

1610
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:28,730
[SPEAKER_07]: All righty.

1611
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,330
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1612
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:41,558
[SPEAKER_05]: So, starting things off as I kind of hinted to earlier, Panda Arcade Adventures Episode 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PC on October 29th.

1613
01:37:43,154 --> 01:37:44,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome news.

1614
01:37:44,816 --> 01:37:51,322
[SPEAKER_05]: No word on PS3 yet, probably just because they just finally got the first episode, so give it a little bit more time.

1615
01:37:51,522 --> 01:37:57,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But it will be $15 on both platforms, and it will be all sorts of awesome.

1616
01:37:57,868 --> 01:38:00,430
[SPEAKER_05]: It better be based on that recommendation.

1617
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:02,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's supposed to be.

1618
01:38:02,652 --> 01:38:06,156
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one was kind of fun, so we'll see why the second one wouldn't be as well.

1619
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:15,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, one thing you might not be getting to do when you play this game online, even though you don't really play this game online, but other Xbox Live games would be, you probably won't get to swear much longer.

1620
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:23,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the US Patent Office has granted a patent to Microsoft for real-time censoring of audio streams.

1621
01:38:23,636 --> 01:38:25,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, this is...

1622
01:38:25,758 --> 01:38:37,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty self-explanatory, probably what Microsoft wants us for is they want to be able to censor what Xbox Live is probably most known for, is the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, you know, and all that stuff that you hear when you go on Xbox Live.

1623
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:39,110
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, they can't censor this show.

1624
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:39,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha-ha.

1625
01:38:40,471 --> 01:38:43,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1626
01:38:44,554 --> 01:38:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

1627
01:38:45,255 --> 01:38:45,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck!

1628
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:47,570
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1629
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:53,532
[SPEAKER_07]: A writer on Ars Technica, though, Jonathan Gitlin, though, brings up a really kind of scary point.

1630
01:38:53,592 --> 01:38:55,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about this, because this is the technology, right?

1631
01:38:56,493 --> 01:38:59,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I can also envisage a much sinister role, however.

1632
01:38:59,974 --> 01:39:02,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine the same system applied to digital telephony.

1633
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:06,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Then think how valuable such a system might be to an authoritarian regime.

1634
01:39:07,857 --> 01:39:14,121
[SPEAKER_07]: As we've seen to good effect in Burma and elsewhere, the ubiquity of cell phones has been a good thing for dissidents who need to get their message out or organize themselves.

1635
01:39:14,501 --> 01:39:18,524
[SPEAKER_07]: The Great Firewall of China already blocks objectionable web content from reaching Chinese computers.

1636
01:39:18,844 --> 01:39:22,607
[SPEAKER_07]: What's to stop cell phones from censoring anti-government conversations too?

1637
01:39:23,027 --> 01:39:24,488
[SPEAKER_07]: That is kind of a scary thought.

1638
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:29,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hope that this isn't used for, you know, anything pushing the limits.

1639
01:39:29,551 --> 01:39:30,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I can imagine this is...

1640
01:39:31,513 --> 01:39:34,395
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a scary thing if it falls into the wrong hands.

1641
01:39:34,535 --> 01:39:35,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Jani brings up an interesting point.

1642
01:39:36,036 --> 01:39:36,616
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that in chat?

1643
01:39:36,636 --> 01:39:39,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine censoring the angry video game nerd.

1644
01:39:40,939 --> 01:39:42,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, still, just anything.

1645
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:43,920
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of threatens free speech.

1646
01:39:43,981 --> 01:39:46,002
[SPEAKER_22]: His powers are beyond Microsoft's comprehension.

1647
01:39:46,802 --> 01:39:47,603
[SPEAKER_07]: If in the wrong hands.

1648
01:39:48,123 --> 01:39:54,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, in this country, since free speech is in our constitution, I don't think it's going to be a big problem, but it could be interesting to see the effect this could have in other places.

1649
01:39:54,907 --> 01:39:55,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the guy makes a good point.

1650
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:56,988
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it falls into the wrong hands?

1651
01:39:57,369 --> 01:40:00,510
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, I can't imagine that this is going to be...

1652
01:40:01,638 --> 01:40:02,738
[SPEAKER_07]: That accurate.

1653
01:40:03,018 --> 01:40:03,599
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1654
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:04,679
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be ways.

1655
01:40:04,839 --> 01:40:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Will it catch me if I say frack?

1656
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,941
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is... What if I'm talking about my shih tzu dog?

1657
01:40:10,201 --> 01:40:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I going to get censored?

1658
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:20,884
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, Rob, about free speech rights... Yeah, the government can't inhibit your free speech rights, but companies sure can when you agree to play by their rules.

1659
01:40:21,025 --> 01:40:21,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

1660
01:40:21,605 --> 01:40:24,766
[SPEAKER_22]: As long as you've signed the agreement saying that you're going to use their...

1661
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:37,752
[SPEAKER_22]: proprietary software, and I guess the hardware too since we're referring to the Xbox, then they do have a right to censor any content that comes through their own equipment.

1662
01:40:37,792 --> 01:40:43,975
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like a private organization denying people the use of their facilities.

1663
01:40:44,423 --> 01:40:44,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1664
01:40:45,263 --> 01:40:50,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I get that, I get that, but still, I'm going to be very disappointed since I pay for Microsoft service if I can't say fuck.

1665
01:40:50,726 --> 01:41:02,171
[SPEAKER_07]: However, knowing Microsoft and based on track history only, I'm going to assume it'll probably be a switch that'll, you know, help keep it safe for kids, which I'm cool with, you know, if parents want to turn it on, but they shouldn't rely on it.

1666
01:41:02,632 --> 01:41:05,493
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other dangerous thing, is I don't want parents to rely on it.

1667
01:41:05,513 --> 01:41:13,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see it like, you know, some of those TBS comedies where they replace it with, like, stupid words, just like ordinary things.

1668
01:41:13,037 --> 01:41:13,717
[SPEAKER_05]: What the freak?

1669
01:41:14,197 --> 01:41:14,897
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fruit?

1670
01:41:15,498 --> 01:41:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: What the French toast?

1671
01:41:18,419 --> 01:41:20,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Shove it up your baloney.

1672
01:41:22,221 --> 01:41:22,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Or kazoo.

1673
01:41:22,861 --> 01:41:30,845
[SPEAKER_22]: To be perfectly honest, the whole reason that swear words are considered swear words in the beginning is because people have given them the power to offend.

1674
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:35,347
[SPEAKER_22]: And what is it that I have been saying for a very long time now?

1675
01:41:35,667 --> 01:41:37,087
[SPEAKER_07]: You find this show very offensive.

1676
01:41:37,267 --> 01:41:37,708
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, whatever.

1677
01:41:38,168 --> 01:41:39,148
[SPEAKER_22]: Learn to be offended.

1678
01:41:39,689 --> 01:41:42,030
[SPEAKER_22]: The less of a big deal you make out of it...

1679
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:44,170
[SPEAKER_22]: The less it's going to matter.

1680
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:44,851
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, really.

1681
01:41:45,691 --> 01:41:52,453
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole reason that I think little kids think it's fun to go out and cuss from their little kids is because their parents say, oh, that's bad and you shouldn't do it.

1682
01:41:53,093 --> 01:41:56,194
[SPEAKER_22]: The less you're allowed to do something, the more you'll want to do it.

1683
01:41:56,554 --> 01:41:57,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1684
01:41:58,415 --> 01:42:00,715
[SPEAKER_03]: People do that because it raises eyebrows.

1685
01:42:02,296 --> 01:42:06,217
[SPEAKER_22]: But if no one gets offended, why would they want to do it anymore?

1686
01:42:06,557 --> 01:42:13,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to see Microsoft I would love to see Microsoft just try and censor this next segment of ours.

1687
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:21,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Fuse of the Week.

1688
01:42:29,909 --> 01:42:48,227
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery to, um, certain, um, closed-minded, tight-assed, bigoted conservatives that have been, um,

1689
01:42:50,356 --> 01:42:53,678
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to other things that are personal and F you to my hair

1690
01:43:07,597 --> 01:43:07,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1691
01:43:08,858 --> 01:43:13,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Fe to Sackboy for being so fluffy, because fluffy equals hot.

1692
01:43:13,402 --> 01:43:15,623
[SPEAKER_05]: You're kind of fluffy, Loki.

1693
01:43:15,843 --> 01:43:16,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I am kind of fluffy.

1694
01:43:16,564 --> 01:43:18,686
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I didn't have to pad the front, just the arms.

1695
01:43:18,706 --> 01:43:21,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no needing to pad myself.

1696
01:43:21,688 --> 01:43:28,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is really friggin' hot, but actually, luckily the sweatshirt is quite thin, so it's not too bad.

1697
01:43:28,373 --> 01:43:34,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have, like, jeans under the pants and another t-shirt under this shirt, so...

1698
01:43:36,351 --> 01:43:36,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1699
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:37,772
[SPEAKER_05]: But the head's really fucking hot.

1700
01:43:37,812 --> 01:43:38,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't do anything with the head.

1701
01:43:39,493 --> 01:43:39,873
[SPEAKER_07]: My turn?

1702
01:43:40,314 --> 01:43:40,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1703
01:43:40,514 --> 01:43:40,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1704
01:43:41,194 --> 01:43:47,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say F you to the people that decided to call me faggot yesterday while I was out protesting Prop 8.

1705
01:43:48,179 --> 01:43:50,160
[SPEAKER_07]: We were out there on the streets holding signs.

1706
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:53,082
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had a big thing that said, you know, protect civil rights and all that stuff.

1707
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:59,166
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a group of us out there and some guy as he drove by decided to yell faggots and throw candy corn at us.

1708
01:43:59,486 --> 01:44:02,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's the world we live in, folks.

1709
01:44:02,108 --> 01:44:04,230
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't know whether to be angry or happy.

1710
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:04,710
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like,

1711
01:44:06,651 --> 01:44:08,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And one hand, I'm offended by what you said.

1712
01:44:08,572 --> 01:44:09,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other hand, candy corn!

1713
01:44:10,793 --> 01:44:12,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Not when they've fallen on a dirty-ass street.

1714
01:44:13,314 --> 01:44:15,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's just unacceptable.

1715
01:44:15,595 --> 01:44:18,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So not only did he say faggot, Loki, he wasted candy corn.

1716
01:44:19,537 --> 01:44:19,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no!

1717
01:44:19,777 --> 01:44:21,838
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't waste candy corn.

1718
01:44:21,918 --> 01:44:31,983
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, is it wrong for me to mention that we're supposed to learn to stop throwing things and having food fights when we're in kindergarten?! !

1719
01:44:32,765 --> 01:44:36,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then, oh, yeah, and then the lady as she was coming out of the drive-thru.

1720
01:44:37,146 --> 01:44:39,347
[SPEAKER_07]: No, here's the best one, the lady coming out of the drive-thru.

1721
01:44:39,827 --> 01:44:41,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Faggots, you're all going to hell.

1722
01:44:41,988 --> 01:44:43,148
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what she yelled at us.

1723
01:44:43,168 --> 01:44:44,088
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have thrown Skittles.

1724
01:44:44,128 --> 01:44:45,009
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you know what I said?

1725
01:44:45,149 --> 01:44:47,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I yelled back, I said, God loves a bigot too.

1726
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:49,210
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I said back to her.

1727
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:50,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Then she drove off, pissed off.

1728
01:44:50,911 --> 01:44:51,211
[SPEAKER_22]: Good.

1729
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:52,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

1730
01:44:53,428 --> 01:44:59,257
[SPEAKER_07]: and so don't sit there and tell me this proposition isn't about hate and discrimination because I'll tell you what, I've seen it right in the face and it is.

1731
01:45:00,819 --> 01:45:02,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

1732
01:45:02,642 --> 01:45:05,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Some real quick FUs from our guests because we have a lot in studio.

1733
01:45:05,106 --> 01:45:06,188
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll start with Drew since he has a mic.

1734
01:45:06,522 --> 01:45:12,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, F you to my student government for being assholes about the whole proposition thing.

1735
01:45:12,463 --> 01:45:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

1736
01:45:13,064 --> 01:45:13,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't vote them in.

1737
01:45:14,884 --> 01:45:19,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're trying to speak for the entire student body and I don't like it one bit.

1738
01:45:19,845 --> 01:45:22,646
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, to go with this, I might have mentioned this earlier.

1739
01:45:23,086 --> 01:45:26,007
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a girl who was driving in front of me leaving school.

1740
01:45:26,387 --> 01:45:27,287
[SPEAKER_22]: We go to the same school.

1741
01:45:28,327 --> 01:45:33,168
[SPEAKER_22]: And she wrote on her car, no to Prop 8, the ARC student council does not represent me.

1742
01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:35,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I approve of that.

1743
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:46,808
[SPEAKER_03]: but also F you to people who are taking the zombie event in WoW a little too far and taking hordes and hordes of zombies people taking WoW too far?

1744
01:45:46,828 --> 01:46:03,540
[SPEAKER_03]: into the lobby zones and killing all the lobbies who are trying to start out that's not cool I mean, yeah, it's zombies and it's brains but it's not cool don't be a dick alright, Hiccup Boy do you have any F yous of the week?

1745
01:46:04,818 --> 01:46:10,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to send an FU toward the bimbo of politicians everywhere.

1746
01:46:11,142 --> 01:46:17,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't even think I need to go any further with that because everybody should know who I'm talking about.

1747
01:46:18,367 --> 01:46:19,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So I shall pass the mic on.

1748
01:46:20,469 --> 01:46:20,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Arcadian42.

1749
01:46:20,949 --> 01:46:24,111
[SPEAKER_29]: Fuck you to 65-hour work weeks.

1750
01:46:24,151 --> 01:46:24,731
[SPEAKER_29]: They suck.

1751
01:46:25,532 --> 01:46:29,615
[SPEAKER_29]: They put me way, way behind on everything.

1752
01:46:31,036 --> 01:46:32,416
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh well, getting money is good.

1753
01:46:33,277 --> 01:46:33,857
[SPEAKER_29]: Money is good.

1754
01:46:34,078 --> 01:46:34,378
[SPEAKER_29]: Doctor.

1755
01:46:34,994 --> 01:46:36,835
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, take us back to some gaming news

1756
01:46:53,614 --> 01:46:54,735
[SPEAKER_22]: Stuff happened, the end.

1757
01:46:56,496 --> 01:47:06,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Ubisoft is actually working on the latest Anno game and actually have had to push it back a little bit.

1758
01:47:07,443 --> 01:47:13,947
[SPEAKER_22]: As well as one that they have literally called an as-yet-unannounced franchise.

1759
01:47:14,467 --> 01:47:17,349
[SPEAKER_22]: They were going to release it 2008-2009 fiscal year, but it's actually going to be 2009-2010.

1760
01:47:21,191 --> 01:47:45,591
[SPEAKER_22]: we don't know what this is but I know 1404 is a settlement building game that speaks for itself there's a trailer around if someone wants to look at game trailers I'm sure there's one there but the other one they're not saying what it is but they said that it's an unannounced one so maybe it's a brand new franchise could be

1761
01:47:48,533 --> 01:47:59,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, something that unfortunately hasn't been delayed is an update to the Wii firmware that's now disabling the Homebrew channel from being installed.

1762
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:06,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Other possible problems faced with that are some Homebrew programs not running.

1763
01:48:06,862 --> 01:48:16,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the video player that they had that also allowed you to watch DVDs is not working as well, the M player.

1764
01:48:17,578 --> 01:48:45,323
[SPEAKER_05]: and um right now though if you do have the homebrew channel installed you're fine but you won't be able to install it if you um you know do 3.3 also in Japan um they have um the shop channel down right now for maintenance as they're changing all the references to Wii points to Nintendo points and other uh pre-DSI maintenance isn't that a little deceiving though because the points aren't going to be interchangeable that strikes me as kind of dumb it is deceiving yes um

1765
01:48:46,445 --> 01:48:53,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also apparently right now, if you don't update your system, you will not be able to access the shop channel.

1766
01:48:53,867 --> 01:49:01,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is ironic because if you think about it, if they're not able to access the shop channel, they won't buy your crap that you're selling online.

1767
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:08,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, with the homebrew stuff, it is easy to, I don't know, pirate said games that you're offering on the service.

1768
01:49:08,890 --> 01:49:14,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that you would want to allow people to be able to purchase your games and let them have fun with the homebrew stuff since...

1769
01:49:15,965 --> 01:49:18,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Give these homebrew people jobs.

1770
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:21,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, there's a lot of might-be-crap games on the Wii.

1771
01:49:40,592 --> 01:49:42,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I can see the other side, though.

1772
01:49:42,753 --> 01:49:44,453
[SPEAKER_07]: People stealing other people's work by pirating such games.

1773
01:49:44,473 --> 01:49:44,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't lie.

1774
01:49:44,913 --> 01:49:46,994
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what a lot of the quote-unquote homebrew people do.

1775
01:49:47,014 --> 01:49:48,555
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see both sides of it, though.

1776
01:50:05,285 --> 01:50:08,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember the old school game show Supermarket Sweep?

1777
01:50:31,089 --> 01:50:31,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that's this.

1778
01:50:31,869 --> 01:50:33,110
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the greatest ever.

1779
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:33,710
[SPEAKER_07]: That's this.

1780
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:35,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, there's a little trailer here we're playing in studio.

1781
01:50:38,012 --> 01:50:38,912
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, yeah.

1782
01:50:40,833 --> 01:50:42,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Lifetime, Lawnmowers Unpacked.

1783
01:50:42,494 --> 01:50:42,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But look at this.

1784
01:50:43,154 --> 01:50:51,277
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually run around the supermarket with your cart, but you pick up plungers for some weird reason, and you run into other shoppers.

1785
01:50:52,318 --> 01:50:55,479
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's everything you've always wanted to do in the supermarket.

1786
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:58,969
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all kind of crazy anime characters.

1787
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:00,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you have it.

1788
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:05,093
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Supermarket Sweep meets Jet Set Radio or something like that.

1789
01:51:05,273 --> 01:51:13,319
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, according to Juan Grill, who's the studio manager for the developers, Joju Games, he says that MartRacer was inspired from the shape of the Wiimote.

1790
01:51:13,339 --> 01:51:17,721
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, quote, The first time I grabbed a Wiimote, instinctively I grabbed it with both hands like a bar.

1791
01:51:18,022 --> 01:51:21,364
[SPEAKER_07]: That made me start thinking on a game where you can maneuver it like you would be grabbing a bar.

1792
01:51:21,864 --> 01:51:22,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So there you go.

1793
01:51:22,665 --> 01:51:24,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to play with a classic controller, you can.

1794
01:51:25,169 --> 01:51:32,438
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess it's probably more fun with motion controls because you can imagine that you're pushing that cart just like a bat out of hell up and down the aisles of Safeway.

1795
01:51:32,458 --> 01:51:33,320
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be lots of fun.

1796
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:35,699
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1797
01:51:59,728 --> 01:52:02,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, what are some other things we can download, DarkSakura?

1798
01:52:03,351 --> 01:52:08,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there is a few games coming out on WiiWare in the UK.

1799
01:52:09,555 --> 01:52:16,740
[SPEAKER_22]: There's the Incredible Maze, which is 500 Wii points, and it's different.

1800
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:23,865
[SPEAKER_22]: It's mazes and has balance board support, so you actually steer a ball around the maze and dodge traps.

1801
01:52:24,226 --> 01:52:27,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, it's Marble Madness with a balance board, from what I understand.

1802
01:52:27,128 --> 01:52:27,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1803
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:54,285
[SPEAKER_22]: there's also interior design well an interior design game called Home Sweet Home that is you basically take rooms and redesign them sort of like a bizarre puzzle and it's a thousand Wii points and then there's Tetris Party which is twelve hundred Wii points that is mini game Tetris using the balance board and it has online multiplayer for up to six people

1804
01:52:56,274 --> 01:52:56,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Click in!

1805
01:52:56,534 --> 01:52:56,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Click in!

1806
01:52:56,814 --> 01:52:57,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Click in!

1807
01:53:25,498 --> 01:53:32,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than stuff coming on to the WiiWare service, there's some interesting stuff if you happen to own a Super Nintendo system.

1808
01:53:33,563 --> 01:53:42,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, a German programmer took it upon himself to create a new console game that supports eight players.

1809
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:52,996
[SPEAKER_05]: His creation is a brawler called N-Warp Daisuken, or it looks like Daisakusen, and allows you to plug in two multitaps in the SNES

1810
01:53:55,497 --> 01:53:57,879
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, it's pretty awesome.

1811
01:53:57,959 --> 01:54:05,563
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can also, if you don't want to, I don't know, say, find a cart for it, since it doesn't look like there is an actual cart, you can play it through an emulator.

1812
01:54:06,343 --> 01:54:09,005
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know, that's pretty awesome.

1813
01:54:09,085 --> 01:54:13,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Eight-player brawler game for Super Nintendo.

1814
01:54:13,967 --> 01:54:22,372
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to download it, the website is gra.deforce3000.de So that's where you can get that wonderful game.

1815
01:54:23,934 --> 01:54:24,275
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1816
01:54:25,116 --> 01:54:30,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for those of you looking forward to new Nintendo products, Animal Crossing City Focus coming out pretty soon.

1817
01:54:30,762 --> 01:54:34,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And a bunch of videos have been kind of shown up around the Internet.

1818
01:54:34,907 --> 01:54:38,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's revealed a lot more about the game, a lot more details about the new Animal Crossing game.

1819
01:54:39,032 --> 01:54:40,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And somewhere Rice Princess is going...

1820
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:42,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, exactly.

1821
01:54:42,236 --> 01:54:43,216
[SPEAKER_11]: She loves Animal Crossing.

1822
01:54:43,376 --> 01:54:43,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I do too.

1823
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:47,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I'm kind of surprised I'm going to be buying this game for the third time.

1824
01:54:47,298 --> 01:54:48,418
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have made some changes.

1825
01:54:48,718 --> 01:54:51,180
[SPEAKER_07]: It's starting to sound like an MMO though, like a patch or something.

1826
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,041
[SPEAKER_07]: At the new auction now, she can't put up fruit or tools.

1827
01:54:55,041 --> 01:54:55,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1828
01:54:55,502 --> 01:54:57,282
[SPEAKER_07]: New chirping birds will appear in your village.

1829
01:54:57,302 --> 01:54:59,403
[SPEAKER_07]: You get clovers brought over in the DS version.

1830
01:54:59,764 --> 01:55:03,485
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the objects like fossils, tools, and accessories show up as 3D objects.

1831
01:55:03,905 --> 01:55:07,607
[SPEAKER_07]: The villages are going to go back to having two different elevation levels like they did in the GameCube.

1832
01:55:08,668 --> 01:55:08,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1833
01:55:09,568 --> 01:55:17,551
[SPEAKER_07]: You have stone bridges in the game over the lakes and rivers that are now wider, probably to hold four people when you're playing on Wi-Fi.

1834
01:55:17,912 --> 01:55:19,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Asetti can actually show up in the city.

1835
01:55:20,813 --> 01:55:24,494
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more grass in your city than dirt, unlike the DS version.

1836
01:55:25,235 --> 01:55:28,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Nook's Cranny and Nook & Go are back as Nook upgrades in the game.

1837
01:55:29,937 --> 01:55:31,818
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a Tom Nook apron shirt.

1838
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:36,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Skunk is a character that will shine your shoes and change the color of them.

1839
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:38,420
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1840
01:56:06,161 --> 01:56:07,062
[SPEAKER_07]: And how's that WeSpeak thing?

1841
01:56:07,082 --> 01:56:07,522
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be fun.

1842
01:56:07,542 --> 01:56:08,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't come with it.

1843
01:56:08,463 --> 01:56:09,103
[SPEAKER_07]: It's optional.

1844
01:56:09,123 --> 01:56:11,525
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can run around going, You're a towel!

1845
01:56:11,985 --> 01:56:12,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1846
01:56:13,507 --> 01:56:13,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

1847
01:56:13,887 --> 01:56:17,490
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go around in these little kids' towels and just go, Fuck!

1848
01:56:20,152 --> 01:56:20,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll bleep it out.

1849
01:56:20,872 --> 01:56:22,874
[SPEAKER_22]: I wonder if I can get my village lesbian back.

1850
01:56:23,614 --> 01:56:24,155
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

1851
01:56:24,515 --> 01:56:28,178
[SPEAKER_22]: No, on the GameCube one, we had our village lesbian.

1852
01:56:28,198 --> 01:56:28,778
[SPEAKER_22]: What was her name?

1853
01:56:28,998 --> 01:56:29,479
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

1854
01:56:29,499 --> 01:56:30,639
[SPEAKER_07]: She was an aardvark or something.

1855
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,461
[SPEAKER_22]: No, she wasn't an aardvark.

1856
01:56:32,901 --> 01:56:33,642
[SPEAKER_07]: She had the huge nose.

1857
01:56:35,143 --> 01:56:36,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1858
01:56:51,081 --> 01:56:52,962
[SPEAKER_07]: See, and now you can put a no on eight sign.

1859
01:56:52,982 --> 01:56:53,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we outed her.

1860
01:56:53,603 --> 01:56:54,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Outside there, too.

1861
01:56:54,283 --> 01:56:54,804
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be great.

1862
01:56:55,564 --> 01:56:57,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to put political messages inside Animal Crossing.

1863
01:56:57,725 --> 01:56:58,946
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be fantastic.

1864
01:56:59,126 --> 01:56:59,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1865
01:56:59,827 --> 01:57:01,628
[SPEAKER_07]: My God, it's going to turn into Second Life.

1866
01:57:01,888 --> 01:57:02,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote for me.

1867
01:57:02,168 --> 01:57:05,511
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember when we were doing bottle messages to advertise the station?

1868
01:57:05,751 --> 01:57:06,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I remember that.

1869
01:57:06,551 --> 01:57:07,892
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to throw a furry at you.

1870
01:57:07,912 --> 01:57:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

1871
01:57:09,253 --> 01:57:09,734
[SPEAKER_22]: With signs.

1872
01:57:10,394 --> 01:57:10,694
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1873
01:57:10,734 --> 01:57:13,136
[SPEAKER_07]: What's also totally fun, interacting with our listeners.

1874
01:57:13,196 --> 01:57:16,178
[SPEAKER_07]: And every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.

1875
01:57:16,198 --> 01:57:20,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And we read some of our emails live here on air, as DarkSakura is going to do right now.

1876
01:57:25,794 --> 01:57:26,814
[SPEAKER_22]: First email.

1877
01:57:26,954 --> 01:57:27,775
[SPEAKER_22]: Dun dun dun.

1878
01:57:28,495 --> 01:57:29,915
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations!

1879
01:57:29,955 --> 01:57:32,076
[SPEAKER_22]: You have made it to 300 episodes.

1880
01:57:32,116 --> 01:57:32,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Bonus round.

1881
01:57:32,776 --> 01:57:33,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Another 300.

1882
01:57:33,637 --> 01:57:34,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Ready, set, go.

1883
01:57:35,097 --> 01:57:38,318
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, U is spelled Y-O-U, not the letter U. Thank you.

1884
01:57:38,938 --> 01:57:39,498
[SPEAKER_22]: No, really.

1885
01:57:39,699 --> 01:57:43,600
[SPEAKER_22]: I, please capitalize your I, must say 300 episodes is freaking epic.

1886
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:45,741
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys are awesome.

1887
01:57:45,881 --> 01:57:51,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Awesome has an E in it, by the way, after W. And... God, what am I doing this for?

1888
01:57:52,885 --> 01:57:55,626
[SPEAKER_22]: And by far the best gaming podcast out there.

1889
01:57:56,006 --> 01:57:58,047
[SPEAKER_22]: You are the most intelligent and comedic, too.

1890
01:57:58,588 --> 01:58:06,292
[SPEAKER_22]: If you don't want to read this part, then don't, but I must say, I was listening to back episodes, and if I lived in Cali, I would join the rebellion against Prop 8.

1891
01:58:06,652 --> 01:58:07,092
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1892
01:58:08,233 --> 01:58:10,214
[SPEAKER_22]: It is stupid and no better than racism.

1893
01:58:11,286 --> 01:58:14,869
[SPEAKER_22]: Off to a better note, I have been playing Jet Set Radio Future for Xbox.

1894
01:58:14,929 --> 01:58:19,613
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember this playing back on my uncle's Xbox and it was freaking nostalgic.

1895
01:58:19,673 --> 01:58:21,555
[SPEAKER_22]: Nostalgic is N-O-S.

1896
01:58:22,656 --> 01:58:22,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1897
01:58:25,378 --> 01:58:28,902
[SPEAKER_22]: The game is as good as any 360 game and in some ways better.

1898
01:58:29,462 --> 01:58:34,186
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, if anyone knows where to get the freaking awesome music for JSRF, tell me.

1899
01:58:34,286 --> 01:58:34,947
[SPEAKER_22]: I want it now.

1900
01:58:35,728 --> 01:58:35,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

1901
01:58:36,408 --> 01:58:43,153
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, just to let you know, they did actually do a soundtrack that they released in... Okay.

1902
01:58:43,813 --> 01:58:44,354
[SPEAKER_22]: America.

1903
01:58:44,374 --> 01:58:46,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Rawr.

1904
01:58:46,315 --> 01:58:48,256
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the Lion Suki on my head now.

1905
01:58:50,098 --> 01:58:54,721
[SPEAKER_22]: But you actually can get the soundtrack for that, and we'll talk.

1906
01:58:55,341 --> 01:58:59,845
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll see about making sure that you acquire this.

1907
01:58:59,885 --> 01:59:01,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Sincerely, Geekboy2424, a.k.a.

1908
01:59:01,226 --> 01:59:01,966
[SPEAKER_22]: the youngest OLR listener.

1909
01:59:01,986 --> 01:59:02,607
[SPEAKER_22]: 300 for the win!

1910
01:59:06,989 --> 01:59:10,382
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I have to say, how young are you, dude?

1911
01:59:10,402 --> 01:59:10,864
[SPEAKER_07]: 14, I think he is.

1912
01:59:11,286 --> 01:59:12,450
[SPEAKER_22]: That's actually not too bad.

1913
01:59:13,659 --> 01:59:14,720
[SPEAKER_22]: The email really not too bad.

1914
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:16,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Just common little things.

1915
01:59:16,561 --> 01:59:19,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think Sakuramax beats him as far as youngness.

1916
01:59:19,863 --> 01:59:21,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Sakuramax is 13, right?

1917
01:59:21,624 --> 01:59:21,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1918
01:59:21,844 --> 01:59:22,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're the same age.

1919
01:59:22,965 --> 01:59:24,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they had a birthday.

1920
01:59:24,225 --> 01:59:24,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're both 14.

1921
01:59:25,266 --> 01:59:25,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember.

1922
01:59:25,826 --> 01:59:26,727
[SPEAKER_22]: They had a birthday.

1923
01:59:26,747 --> 01:59:28,047
[SPEAKER_07]: You must fight to the death.

1924
01:59:28,268 --> 01:59:29,448
[SPEAKER_22]: One is the evil twin.

1925
01:59:30,469 --> 01:59:31,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Look for a kid with a goatee.

1926
01:59:32,210 --> 01:59:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Two men enter.

1927
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:34,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Two men enter.

1928
01:59:34,331 --> 01:59:34,971
[SPEAKER_03]: One man leaves.

1929
01:59:35,051 --> 01:59:36,452
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Orange Lounge.

1930
01:59:36,712 --> 01:59:37,013
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

1931
01:59:38,013 --> 01:59:39,034
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, OLR.

1932
01:59:40,035 --> 01:59:46,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't know if you've already covered this in the 299th episode, but just in case, I get a smiley face.

1933
01:59:46,881 --> 01:59:48,403
[SPEAKER_22]: It says, here you can get the game.

1934
01:59:48,443 --> 01:59:55,469
[SPEAKER_22]: And this is from Ilya, aka 13nextforever, and it's actually about a Metroid 2 remake.

1935
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:57,691
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Project AM2R, where they are...

1936
02:00:05,401 --> 02:00:07,762
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really not sure exactly what's going into it.

1937
02:00:07,822 --> 02:00:20,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, they're remaking Metroid 2, like the Game Boy one, in color, I think, looking very... Super Metroid-ish.

1938
02:00:21,485 --> 02:00:24,466
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's very Super Metroid-ish.

1939
02:00:24,946 --> 02:00:27,147
[SPEAKER_22]: But the graphics are actually really pretty.

1940
02:00:28,007 --> 02:00:29,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen the remake so far.

1941
02:00:29,588 --> 02:00:31,108
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very well done.

1942
02:00:34,197 --> 02:00:37,239
[SPEAKER_22]: I've sent a link to that site in the chat room, by the way.

1943
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:40,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Misty, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1944
02:00:43,063 --> 02:00:45,625
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't, you don't, you shouldn't feel old.

1945
02:00:45,985 --> 02:00:48,287
[SPEAKER_22]: No, nuh-uh.

1946
02:00:48,307 --> 02:00:48,347
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1947
02:00:48,367 --> 02:00:51,249
[SPEAKER_07]: The chatters were talking about how old they were when they started listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1948
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:53,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It was making the hosts feel very old.

1949
02:00:53,571 --> 02:00:57,214
[SPEAKER_22]: How old was I when we started doing Orange Lounge Radio?

1950
02:00:57,314 --> 02:00:57,554
[SPEAKER_22]: I was 26, 27.

1951
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:06,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I was 23, but I was like three days before my 24th birthday.

1952
02:01:06,441 --> 02:01:08,343
[SPEAKER_22]: I was 26 when we started doing this show.

1953
02:01:08,503 --> 02:01:09,063
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god.

1954
02:01:10,304 --> 02:01:11,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Shoot me, Rob.

1955
02:01:11,645 --> 02:01:11,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Bang.

1956
02:01:14,127 --> 02:01:14,707
[SPEAKER_22]: My mom's turning 50.

1957
02:01:14,747 --> 02:01:18,610
[SPEAKER_22]: Happy birthday, Mom!

1958
02:01:19,510 --> 02:01:20,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You should call her.

1959
02:01:22,372 --> 02:01:27,156
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, we won't be here next week to do it, so... We should call my mom later.

1960
02:01:27,356 --> 02:01:27,576
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

1961
02:01:28,417 --> 02:01:29,197
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, email, right?

1962
02:01:30,118 --> 02:01:30,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1963
02:01:30,318 --> 02:01:30,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1964
02:01:31,207 --> 02:01:35,238
[SPEAKER_22]: So, thank you for that kind, kind email.

1965
02:01:35,258 --> 02:01:35,640
[SPEAKER_22]: 13X forever.

1966
02:01:37,859 --> 02:01:38,459
[SPEAKER_22]: Next one.

1967
02:01:38,820 --> 02:01:40,401
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God, I don't know who this person is.

1968
02:01:40,441 --> 02:01:41,081
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just sauce.

1969
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:41,701
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

1970
02:01:42,142 --> 02:01:43,062
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey there, OLR.

1971
02:01:43,362 --> 02:01:45,224
[SPEAKER_22]: Congratulations on 300 episodes.

1972
02:01:45,384 --> 02:01:51,347
[SPEAKER_22]: In honor of episode 300, I wrote a song for you guys to the tune of Hey There, Delilah by the Plain White Tees.

1973
02:01:51,807 --> 02:01:52,688
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a link here.

1974
02:01:53,048 --> 02:01:57,471
[SPEAKER_22]: The song runs over two minutes, however, and Rob said to keep it under a minute if we send anything in.

1975
02:01:57,791 --> 02:02:02,414
[SPEAKER_22]: She don't have a recording of it quite yet, and she did give us lyrics to it.

1976
02:02:03,269 --> 02:02:06,193
[SPEAKER_07]: She posted it on Twitter and I read the parody and it's very cute.

1977
02:02:06,833 --> 02:02:09,696
[SPEAKER_22]: I could read it right now unless Rob wants to read it.

1978
02:02:09,997 --> 02:02:10,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to sing it.

1979
02:02:10,818 --> 02:02:14,902
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the song also, which is part of the problem.

1980
02:02:16,404 --> 02:02:16,925
[SPEAKER_07]: You can read it.

1981
02:02:17,485 --> 02:02:17,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1982
02:02:18,827 --> 02:02:19,447
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to read it?

1983
02:02:19,507 --> 02:02:20,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I find it on Twitter.

1984
02:02:20,629 --> 02:02:21,029
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't mind.

1985
02:02:21,390 --> 02:02:21,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see.

1986
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:22,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, go for it.

1987
02:02:23,058 --> 02:02:25,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey there, OLR, what's it like in Sacramento?

1988
02:02:25,321 --> 02:02:30,487
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm 500 miles away, but now I'll listen to your show just for you No other podcast outshines you, I swear it's true

1989
02:02:40,059 --> 02:02:41,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey there, OLR, don't you worry about your ratings.

1990
02:02:42,001 --> 02:02:44,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Your fans will download your podcast and share it with our friends.

1991

[SPEAKER_22]: We'll tell, too.

1992

[SPEAKER_22]: There's no place else we'd go for news.

1993
02:02:47,846 --> 02:02:48,466
[SPEAKER_22]: You know it's true.

1994
02:02:48,806 --> 02:02:50,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, 300 episodes, chorus part.

1995
02:02:51,609 --> 02:02:53,410
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not going to repeat it.

1996
02:02:54,091 --> 02:02:56,332
[SPEAKER_22]: 300 shows seems like a lot, but don't you stop.

1997
02:02:56,392 --> 02:02:57,033
[SPEAKER_22]: Give it a shot.

1998
02:02:57,473 --> 02:02:58,954
[SPEAKER_22]: I know this show is running kind of late.

1999
02:02:58,975 --> 02:03:03,818
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura needs to read FUs, and Loki's got some gaming news, and Bobby makes Sky start the show real late."

2000
02:03:05,103 --> 02:03:06,065

02:04:48,435 --> 02:04:54,857
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am going to... Wow, if we did 300 more, we'd almost be 40 by the time we got to that point.

2025
02:04:54,877 --> 02:04:55,538
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Rob, I would be 40.

2026
02:04:56,898 --> 02:04:57,418
[SPEAKER_22]: So shut up.

2027
02:04:57,458 --> 02:04:58,439
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I wouldn't be 40, would I?

2028
02:04:58,759 --> 02:04:59,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

2029
02:04:59,459 --> 02:04:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost.

2030
02:05:02,040 --> 02:05:02,400
[SPEAKER_22]: God.

2031
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:04,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob, I'm feeling old now, you know.

2032
02:05:04,941 --> 02:05:05,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, join the club.

2033
02:05:06,665 --> 02:05:08,766
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me, Mr. Three years younger than me.

2034
02:05:09,226 --> 02:05:09,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Two years younger than me.

2035
02:05:14,428 --> 02:05:15,489
[SPEAKER_07]: I know death is coming for me.

2036
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:17,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, Sauce had the best suggestion.

2037
02:05:18,590 --> 02:05:21,071
[SPEAKER_22]: To do womanizer to Loki's tingalizer.

2038
02:05:24,633 --> 02:05:24,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

2039
02:05:25,133 --> 02:05:25,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

2040
02:05:25,413 --> 02:05:26,473
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an excellent idea.

2041
02:05:28,014 --> 02:05:28,334
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

2042
02:05:29,014 --> 02:05:29,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to see you agree.

2043
02:05:29,935 --> 02:05:30,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Now do it.

2044
02:05:31,175 --> 02:05:32,915
[SPEAKER_22]: This one comes from Dan Shadow.

2045
02:05:59,631 --> 02:06:01,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already gotten most of the games I'm looking forward to.

2046
02:06:01,572 --> 02:06:03,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the only thing I have left is Resistance 2.

2047
02:06:03,993 --> 02:06:04,933
[SPEAKER_22]: Resistance 2 is a good one.

2048
02:06:05,433 --> 02:06:06,854
[SPEAKER_22]: Mel, do you have anyone you're looking forward to?

2049
02:06:08,554 --> 02:06:08,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone else?

2050
02:06:10,335 --> 02:06:10,975
[SPEAKER_22]: Left 4 Dead.

2051
02:06:11,695 --> 02:06:13,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I want zombie action.

2052
02:06:17,778 --> 02:06:19,618
[SPEAKER_22]: Speak into the microphone if you're going to make a decision.

2053
02:06:19,638 --> 02:06:19,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?

2054
02:06:20,018 --> 02:06:20,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, what'd I miss?

2055
02:06:20,579 --> 02:06:21,199
[SPEAKER_04]: The Last Remnant.

2056
02:06:21,939 --> 02:06:24,400
[SPEAKER_22]: What game are you looking forward to that hasn't come out yet that you don't already have?

2057
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:31,914
[SPEAKER_07]: LittleBigPlanet Fallout 3 I'm also looking forward to Last Remnant though even though I was not a fan of Infinite Undiscovery The beginning was awful I didn't want to play it past the first hour

2058
02:06:54,042 --> 02:06:54,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

2059
02:07:18,194 --> 02:07:23,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course we know about the new game coming out, Halo Recon, or Halo 3 Recon.

2060
02:07:24,659 --> 02:07:29,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently though, Bungie's Halo team is moving on to other things once this is done.

2061
02:07:31,545 --> 02:07:36,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, maybe another game from Bungie that's, say, not Halo?

2062
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:41,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a, I don't know, a marathon game?

2063
02:07:42,174 --> 02:07:42,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that?

2064
02:07:42,715 --> 02:07:43,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Malo.

2065
02:07:43,816 --> 02:07:44,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Malo.

2066
02:07:45,717 --> 02:07:46,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Marathono.

2067
02:07:47,987 --> 02:07:49,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Have they said this before?

2068
02:07:49,428 --> 02:07:51,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, we swear we're not doing another Halo.

2069
02:07:51,348 --> 02:07:53,809
[SPEAKER_05]: They said this before, like after Halo 3, but, you know.

2070
02:07:54,350 --> 02:07:58,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, basically, they were saying that they want to work on different territory.

2071
02:07:59,091 --> 02:08:06,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, but I think when this project wraps up in a couple months, that it will be time when the team moves on to something else.

2072
02:08:07,255 --> 02:08:13,277
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of the team will move on to something else, and part of them will probably be absorbed into one of the other projects that are already on the way.

2073
02:08:14,318 --> 02:08:16,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what Deakman suggests in the chat room.

2074
02:08:16,438 --> 02:08:17,539
[SPEAKER_05]: A game called J-Lo.

2075
02:08:20,492 --> 02:08:20,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

2076
02:08:22,332 --> 02:08:24,153
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have my love.

2077
02:08:25,193 --> 02:08:25,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

2078
02:08:27,014 --> 02:08:29,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know how the PlayStation 3 has trophies?

2079
02:08:29,494 --> 02:08:30,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, according to the U.S.

2080
02:08:30,935 --> 02:08:35,696
[SPEAKER_07]: official PlayStation magazine, Sony might actually be giving out more than just trophies pretty soon.

2081
02:08:35,756 --> 02:08:38,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little quote from the magazine that people were reading way too much into.

2082
02:08:38,396 --> 02:08:43,117
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, quote, We've heard that SCEA is mulling over some sort of trophy reward system.

2083
02:08:43,498 --> 02:08:48,219
[SPEAKER_07]: We doubt it'll be cash or the equivalent, but we suspect it might be exclusive access to early betas and the like.

2084
02:08:48,679 --> 02:08:48,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

2085
02:08:49,739 --> 02:08:53,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, trophies are like PlayStation 3's version of 360's achievements.

2086
02:08:53,642 --> 02:08:58,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that be interesting if suddenly you could use your trophies to now get into betas and stuff?

2087
02:08:59,087 --> 02:09:02,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Microsoft should do the same thing because I play a lot more Microsoft games.

2088
02:09:03,611 --> 02:09:07,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, and I agree with the people that wrote this story on the net.

2089
02:09:07,815 --> 02:09:12,879
[SPEAKER_07]: I got no problem if it's early demos or what have you, but just to give exclusive?

2090
02:09:13,379 --> 02:09:14,520
[SPEAKER_07]: That seems kind of wrong to me.

2091
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Just encourages people to do nothing but play games all day.

2092
02:09:17,503 --> 02:09:30,628
[SPEAKER_05]: but then again this whole thing could be just something retarded similar to what Gears of War is doing you know where for example if you have different achievements in Gears of War that you get shipped for Gears of War 2 could it be something like that?

2093
02:09:31,188 --> 02:09:42,752
[SPEAKER_05]: that would make sense I beat LittleBigPlanet when LittleBigPlanet 2 comes out or something like that I get some stupid costume or something that works that works

2094
02:09:43,734 --> 02:09:45,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, well we'll see what happens.

2095
02:09:45,114 --> 02:09:46,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe more to come from Sony probably in 2009.

2096
02:09:47,255 --> 02:09:48,695
[SPEAKER_22]: I doubt that.

2097
02:09:48,755 --> 02:09:49,776
[SPEAKER_22]: Sony's going to explode.

2098
02:09:49,976 --> 02:09:50,296
[SPEAKER_22]: The end.

2099
02:09:54,557 --> 02:09:55,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It already exploded.

2100
02:09:55,657 --> 02:09:57,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It puked out something called Star Wars Galaxies.

2101
02:09:58,278 --> 02:09:59,218
[SPEAKER_07]: BlackWolf has a good point.

2102
02:09:59,258 --> 02:10:00,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to read this in chat.

2103
02:10:00,618 --> 02:10:01,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Sky, what's better?

2104
02:10:01,799 --> 02:10:06,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Giving exclusive betas to people who have lots of trophies or giving exclusive betas to people who buy core?

2105
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:07,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take option three.

2106
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Giving exclusive betas to me.

2107
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:10,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2108
02:10:10,612 --> 02:10:12,154
[SPEAKER_22]: Here, the cheat has a trophy!

2109
02:10:13,335 --> 02:10:13,596
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

2110
02:10:14,036 --> 02:10:15,578
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, the fanboys will never be happy.

2111
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:22,986
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there is a boy named Brandon Crisp.

2112
02:10:25,149 --> 02:10:31,773
[SPEAKER_22]: 15 years old who went missing after his parents confiscated his Xbox.

2113
02:10:33,294 --> 02:10:42,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Microsoft Canada is adding $25,000 to the reward information that will hopefully lead to his safe return.

2114
02:10:42,939 --> 02:10:45,281
[SPEAKER_22]: So they're basically doubling the amount that's already out.

2115
02:10:45,361 --> 02:10:49,003
[SPEAKER_22]: They're working with the Barrie, Ontario authorities

2116
02:10:50,643 --> 02:10:56,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Looking for IP addresses of anyone who would come into contact with him through Call of Duty 4, which was his favorite game.

2117
02:10:59,586 --> 02:11:06,688
[SPEAKER_22]: And Microsoft is really, really putting forward a lot of effort into trying to get this kid back.

2118
02:11:08,469 --> 02:11:14,411
[SPEAKER_22]: So basically... Oh God, I hate this person.

2119
02:11:14,431 --> 02:11:15,591
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it Microsoft's problem?

2120
02:11:17,721 --> 02:11:22,625
[SPEAKER_22]: He who shall not be named has involved himself What the fuck?

2121
02:11:22,665 --> 02:11:23,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought he was gone.

2122
02:11:24,626 --> 02:11:25,327
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me finish.

2123
02:11:26,528 --> 02:11:37,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Making an offer to help the cops try to find it and making up some crap about video game addiction or whatever the fuck he's on.

2124
02:11:37,896 --> 02:11:37,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

2125
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:43,170
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm so disgusted with him

2126
02:12:03,348 --> 02:12:05,049
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just completely disgusted.

2127
02:12:05,209 --> 02:12:06,991
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't even call him a human being anymore.

2128
02:12:07,551 --> 02:12:11,094
[SPEAKER_22]: Really, he's just disgusting.

2129
02:12:11,174 --> 02:12:11,674
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a fart.

2130
02:12:13,235 --> 02:12:21,381
[SPEAKER_22]: At any rate, for anyone who might have some information on his whereabouts, call the Berry Police at 705-725-7025.

2131
02:12:21,401 --> 02:12:21,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2132
02:12:29,843 --> 02:12:31,644
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope that someone can find this kid.

2133
02:12:31,664 --> 02:12:34,105
[SPEAKER_22]: I just hope that, you know, he's okay.

2134
02:12:37,006 --> 02:12:38,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop being an asshole and get out there and look.

2135
02:12:39,107 --> 02:12:40,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone needs to find him before Jack does.

2136
02:12:41,208 --> 02:12:41,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god.

2137
02:12:42,308 --> 02:12:44,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if he finds him, we'll never hear the end of it.

2138
02:12:45,730 --> 02:12:46,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

2139
02:12:46,730 --> 02:12:48,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at all the good I do.

2140
02:12:48,611 --> 02:12:49,972
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just disgusted.

2141
02:12:50,372 --> 02:12:52,893
[SPEAKER_22]: I really am horrified, you know.

2142
02:12:54,193 --> 02:12:55,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Who does he think he is?

2143
02:12:57,630 --> 02:13:04,676
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, he seriously has caused so much harm to so many people and he can't stop.

2144
02:13:04,716 --> 02:13:08,319
[SPEAKER_22]: He's already being punished for it and asshole hasn't learned his lesson yet.

2145
02:13:08,839 --> 02:13:15,465
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, seriously, the only thing that's going to stop this guy is to lock him up in a padded room and have him yell his insults to the wall that does not care.

2146
02:13:17,907 --> 02:13:18,227
[SPEAKER_22]: The end.

2147
02:13:19,315 --> 02:13:21,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just hope the wall doesn't have a blog.

2148
02:13:21,358 --> 02:13:23,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's hope the wall fucking bitch slaps him.

2149
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:26,224
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I'm a wall, and even I hate you.

2150
02:13:29,788 --> 02:13:30,189
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2151
02:13:30,749 --> 02:13:31,190
[SPEAKER_07]: More news.

2152
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:33,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to open up the Skype line very soon at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2153
02:13:36,739 --> 02:13:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Legendary Pictures, the company that has done wonderful movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and of course some other stuff.

2154
02:13:46,787 --> 02:13:48,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I can only remember the Batman stuff right now.

2155
02:13:48,728 --> 02:13:54,813
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are also putting together a non-Batman movie that is going to be Gears of War.

2156
02:13:54,853 --> 02:14:01,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Going along with that, Variety is reporting that Legendary Pictures may also be in talks to buy Epic Games.

2157
02:14:03,382 --> 02:14:04,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Unreal 3 Town Unreal 3 the RPG

2158
02:14:31,004 --> 02:14:34,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiger Claw would like to point out that Legendary Pictures also did the upcoming Watchmen movie.

2159
02:14:35,026 --> 02:14:35,446
[SPEAKER_07]: It's coming out.

2160
02:14:35,526 --> 02:14:35,786
[SPEAKER_07]: It's awesome.

2161
02:14:35,806 --> 02:14:36,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they also do 300?

2162
02:14:37,387 --> 02:14:37,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2163
02:14:37,767 --> 02:14:38,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine.

2164
02:14:38,748 --> 02:14:39,228
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

2165
02:14:40,988 --> 02:14:42,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, is this some softcore porn?

2166
02:14:42,529 --> 02:14:42,709
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2167
02:14:42,729 --> 02:14:43,489
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be hot.

2168
02:14:44,150 --> 02:14:45,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, woo, porn!

2169
02:14:45,550 --> 02:14:51,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, anyway, one more story for you guys tonight and then we're going to open up the Skype line and that story has to do with Street Fighter 4.

2170
02:14:52,273 --> 02:14:56,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter 4, it's coming out this winter for sure, says Capcom.

2171
02:14:57,035 --> 02:14:58,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Now keep in mind, Loki's...

2172
02:14:59,116 --> 02:15:00,256
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, next year.

2173
02:15:00,917 --> 02:15:02,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a real good idea when this game's coming out.

2174
02:15:02,978 --> 02:15:09,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the rumors have all been now that, I mean, originally it was supposed to be like January sometime, but now they're trying to time it with the release of the movie.

2175
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:09,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

2176
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:12,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So, probably around the time that the crappy movie comes out.

2177
02:15:13,122 --> 02:15:15,563
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, winter does not mean necessarily this year.

2178
02:15:15,663 --> 02:15:17,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter is also January and February.

2179
02:15:17,383 --> 02:15:19,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Winter, December through February.

2180
02:15:19,644 --> 02:15:25,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the movie itself is being released in that time period where all the stinker movies are released, which is like...

2181
02:15:26,107 --> 02:15:26,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

2182
02:15:46,519 --> 02:15:47,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, agree, the game.

2183
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:48,901
[SPEAKER_05]: By far.

2184
02:15:49,201 --> 02:15:49,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2185
02:15:50,121 --> 02:15:53,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the movie will be a surprise and it'll be this epic, awesome movie.

2186
02:15:54,024 --> 02:15:55,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, except it won't.

2187
02:15:55,745 --> 02:15:55,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2188
02:15:55,945 --> 02:15:56,406
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be crap.

2189
02:15:56,566 --> 02:15:57,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in here.

2190
02:15:57,186 --> 02:15:57,566
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with you.

2191
02:15:58,507 --> 02:16:00,668
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go to the Skype line.

2192
02:16:00,688 --> 02:16:04,431
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2193
02:16:04,931 --> 02:16:05,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2194
02:16:05,932 --> 02:16:06,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2195
02:16:07,693 --> 02:16:08,374
[SPEAKER_25]: It's GS68.

2196
02:16:08,494 --> 02:16:09,634
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, GS68.

2197
02:16:09,654 --> 02:16:10,075
[SPEAKER_25]: What's on your mind?

2198
02:16:11,412 --> 02:16:17,014
[SPEAKER_25]: I got around to playing the new Castlevania this week, which I'm surprised you didn't mention on last week's release dates.

2199
02:16:18,074 --> 02:16:18,615
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, did you?

2200
02:16:18,915 --> 02:16:20,335
[SPEAKER_25]: No, didn't we get mentioned at the end?

2201
02:16:20,435 --> 02:16:20,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we did.

2202
02:16:21,275 --> 02:16:21,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we did.

2203
02:16:22,696 --> 02:16:25,777
[SPEAKER_07]: The podcast is a little behind, so make sure you have the most current episode.

2204
02:16:26,097 --> 02:16:26,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I don't.

2205
02:16:26,937 --> 02:16:28,618
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm not downloading the podcast.

2206
02:16:29,458 --> 02:16:30,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, I think it got mentioned.

2207
02:16:30,999 --> 02:16:33,019
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, okay, so I haven't played it yet.

2208
02:16:33,059 --> 02:16:33,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to.

2209
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:34,180
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of the game?

2210
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:40,602
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like the other DS Castlevanias, more or less.

2211
02:16:41,206 --> 02:16:46,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I like how they have a lot of new areas now, such as one big area.

2212
02:16:48,530 --> 02:16:50,250
[SPEAKER_25]: How does it compare to previous Castlevania games?

2213
02:16:51,271 --> 02:17:03,377
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, the maps, for example, they're smaller now, but there's more enemies, so it's more difficult, and you'll usually be so busy fighting enemies that you'll hardly notice that the maps are smaller, especially because...

2214
02:17:04,249 --> 02:17:07,251
[SPEAKER_25]: For this game, I hardly use the map.

2215
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:11,233
[SPEAKER_25]: I usually have the second screen for checking enemies and stuff.

2216
02:17:15,416 --> 02:17:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any really bad B-movie dialogue in the game?

2217
02:17:20,759 --> 02:17:22,900
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, the English voice acting kind of sucks.

2218
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:27,683
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's a Japanese language option, but for me it doesn't make it any better.

2219
02:17:27,723 --> 02:17:31,205
[SPEAKER_25]: All it does is make it into a language that I'm not very fluent in yet.

2220
02:17:34,294 --> 02:17:36,395
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, well, do you recommend it to fans of Castlevania?

2221
02:17:37,555 --> 02:17:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2222
02:17:39,455 --> 02:17:41,156
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't sound like a very solid yes.

2223
02:17:43,656 --> 02:17:46,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like a, yeah, I guess.

2224
02:17:46,117 --> 02:17:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you have nothing better to do, I guess you could do it.

2225
02:17:51,158 --> 02:17:58,199
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're looking for a game that's more action-oriented and exploration-oriented, this is a pretty good game to try out.

2226
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:01,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

2227
02:18:02,003 --> 02:18:02,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

2228
02:18:02,543 --> 02:18:04,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to talk to our listeners about today?

2229
02:18:07,006 --> 02:18:07,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much, really.

2230
02:18:08,246 --> 02:18:08,647
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2231
02:18:08,987 --> 02:18:10,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2232
02:18:10,628 --> 02:18:11,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy Castlevania.

2233
02:18:11,648 --> 02:18:12,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun playing it while I can.

2234
02:18:12,949 --> 02:18:13,169
[SPEAKER_25]: See you.

2235
02:18:13,189 --> 02:18:13,709
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2236
02:18:13,729 --> 02:18:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2237
02:18:13,809 --> 02:18:17,752
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2238
02:18:17,772 --> 02:18:19,513
[SPEAKER_07]: His name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2239
02:18:20,193 --> 02:18:21,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2240
02:18:21,133 --> 02:18:21,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2241
02:18:22,434 --> 02:18:22,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, hey.

2242
02:18:23,055 --> 02:18:23,635
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Ranma.

2243
02:18:23,835 --> 02:18:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Ranma.

2244
02:18:24,315 --> 02:18:24,956
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2245
02:18:25,656 --> 02:18:26,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

2246
02:18:26,376 --> 02:18:26,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

2247
02:18:26,656 --> 02:18:27,377
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up, everybody?

2248
02:18:28,796 --> 02:18:29,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, what's up?

2249
02:18:30,657 --> 02:18:32,358
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up?

2250
02:18:33,358 --> 02:18:38,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I begin, I have here on my table three drinks.

2251
02:18:38,782 --> 02:18:40,503
[SPEAKER_10]: One for each of you awesome hosts.

2252
02:18:41,063 --> 02:18:41,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you very much.

2253
02:18:42,344 --> 02:18:43,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to drink them all right now, live on air?

2254
02:18:44,946 --> 02:18:45,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am.

2255
02:18:45,966 --> 02:18:46,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

2256
02:18:47,107 --> 02:18:48,047
[SPEAKER_10]: What's drink number one?

2257
02:18:48,828 --> 02:18:50,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Drink number one is for Jamie.

2258
02:18:50,929 --> 02:18:51,550
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a, uh...

2259
02:18:52,498 --> 02:18:54,719
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something straight forward and hard.

2260
02:18:54,959 --> 02:18:55,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Straight to the punch.

2261
02:18:56,079 --> 02:18:57,160
[SPEAKER_10]: A shot of Jack Daniels.

2262
02:18:57,780 --> 02:18:58,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

2263
02:18:59,421 --> 02:19:01,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you're being responsible.

2264
02:19:01,762 --> 02:19:02,842
[SPEAKER_07]: There went shot number one.

2265
02:19:02,882 --> 02:19:04,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard that.

2266
02:19:05,023 --> 02:19:05,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Shot number two?

2267
02:19:06,523 --> 02:19:08,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Shot number two is for you, Rob.

2268
02:19:08,424 --> 02:19:10,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Something nice and fruity.

2269
02:19:11,385 --> 02:19:13,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course.

2270
02:19:13,827 --> 02:19:15,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange juice and peach schnapps.

2271
02:19:15,969 --> 02:19:16,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

2272
02:19:16,410 --> 02:19:18,231
[SPEAKER_22]: That is tasty.

2273
02:19:18,271 --> 02:19:18,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds quite gay.

2274
02:19:19,112 --> 02:19:19,372
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2275
02:19:19,733 --> 02:19:19,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

2276
02:19:21,494 --> 02:19:22,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to make it more hype.

2277
02:19:22,675 --> 02:19:25,698
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2278
02:19:25,798 --> 02:19:27,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is shot number three, Pray Tell?

2279
02:19:28,341 --> 02:19:29,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2280
02:19:29,301 --> 02:19:31,323
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked a friend of mine who came over to make the drink.

2281
02:19:31,584 --> 02:19:35,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I call it the Loki because Loki is unstable, so I don't know what's in it.

2282
02:19:36,235 --> 02:19:37,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so fucked up right now.

2283
02:19:37,235 --> 02:19:38,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so fucked up right now.

2284
02:19:38,296 --> 02:19:38,876
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

2285
02:19:38,916 --> 02:19:39,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

2286
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:02,481
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2287
02:20:02,521 --> 02:20:06,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anything else you wanted to share with us tonight besides drinking live on air?

2288
02:20:07,045 --> 02:20:09,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Kicked up Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour.

2289
02:20:09,787 --> 02:20:10,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, at the same time?

2290
02:20:11,508 --> 02:20:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2291
02:20:12,149 --> 02:20:12,910
[SPEAKER_07]: And which one's better?

2292
02:20:14,751 --> 02:20:16,833
[SPEAKER_10]: The jury is still out, but I will say this much.

2293
02:20:16,873 --> 02:20:21,597
[SPEAKER_10]: When it comes to Bon Jovi living on a prayer, Guitar Hero World Tour is a lot better.

2294
02:20:22,890 --> 02:20:29,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing though, Guitar Hero World Tour actually made Bobby say fuck on his show.

2295
02:20:29,543 --> 02:20:31,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, that makes me really worried.

2296
02:20:32,007 --> 02:20:33,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, not even Rock Revolution did that.

2297
02:20:36,069 --> 02:20:40,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to get Rock Revolution soon, but we're going to probably wait until a used copy pops up.

2298
02:20:40,371 --> 02:20:44,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you notice that Rock Revolution has a real basement Metacritic score?

2299
02:20:45,433 --> 02:20:46,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of sad.

2300
02:20:46,673 --> 02:20:47,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It was getting like threes.

2301
02:20:48,114 --> 02:20:48,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crap.

2302
02:20:48,894 --> 02:20:50,635
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's disturbing.

2303
02:20:50,675 --> 02:20:54,617
[SPEAKER_07]: I still want to get it because I'm sick, but I'm waiting for it to go on clearance because you know it's just a matter of time.

2304
02:20:55,477 --> 02:20:56,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Same here, definitely.

2305
02:20:56,838 --> 02:20:57,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Yo, Ranma.

2306
02:20:57,598 --> 02:20:58,218
[SPEAKER_07]: We're waiting for clearance.

2307
02:20:58,238 --> 02:20:59,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, drink for the guests, dude.

2308
02:21:00,919 --> 02:21:01,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We deserve it too.

2309
02:21:26,610 --> 02:21:27,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, there you go.

2310
02:21:28,091 --> 02:21:29,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Ranma, we gotta let you go for more calls.

2311
02:21:29,592 --> 02:21:31,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good one, buddy.

2312
02:21:31,733 --> 02:21:31,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Later.

2313
02:21:34,875 --> 02:21:35,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2314
02:21:35,856 --> 02:21:36,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2315
02:21:37,277 --> 02:21:38,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello there, Orange Lounge.

2316
02:21:38,558 --> 02:21:39,779
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Akiriper.

2317
02:21:39,979 --> 02:21:41,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, my friend.

2318
02:21:41,139 --> 02:21:41,460
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

2319
02:21:42,682 --> 02:21:43,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing just fine.

2320
02:21:44,662 --> 02:21:45,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what did I call?

2321
02:21:45,883 --> 02:22:07,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was quite surprised that at last the downloadable pack this week for Rock Band, in the sense that it was a few Sushis and Banshees songs, were really like my best news of the week, actually.

2322
02:22:07,648 --> 02:22:09,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I know, I'm very excited about that.

2323
02:22:09,930 --> 02:22:13,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice to see a nice eclectic mix of music and rock band.

2324
02:22:14,473 --> 02:22:26,862
[SPEAKER_08]: My problem is, though, that of the three songs that are there, only one of them is good, actually.

2325
02:22:27,304 --> 02:22:29,145
[SPEAKER_07]: If you actually are to be picky.

2326
02:22:29,426 --> 02:22:34,810
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no peekaboo or anything, which would be rad, but I can't imagine actually playing that song in a rock band, that's the thing.

2327
02:22:34,930 --> 02:22:47,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, that you're mentioning peekaboo is like, if you know the history behind that song, you know that it will be quite hard in one way, since the whole song is played backwards.

2328
02:22:48,460 --> 02:22:49,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

2329
02:22:51,826 --> 02:22:55,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Since they have to learn how to play it all backwards.

2330
02:22:55,549 --> 02:22:57,450
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be a fun challenge mode, though.

2331
02:22:57,470 --> 02:22:59,131
[SPEAKER_07]: The notes can scroll the opposite way.

2332
02:22:59,151 --> 02:23:02,474
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be fun.

2333
02:23:03,835 --> 02:23:05,376
[SPEAKER_07]: What else is going on in your gaming world this week?

2334
02:23:06,516 --> 02:23:07,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much, actually.

2335
02:23:07,557 --> 02:23:09,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much at all.

2336
02:23:12,640 --> 02:23:15,362
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a sad thing in one way.

2337
02:23:15,763 --> 02:23:19,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought Warhammer Online when it came out, and

2338
02:23:19,918 --> 02:23:28,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have played it like... The number of times I have actually played it, I can count it on one hand.

2339
02:23:28,224 --> 02:23:28,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, me too.

2340
02:23:29,025 --> 02:23:30,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the exact same boat you are.

2341
02:23:31,272 --> 02:23:34,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I started thinking in one way, actually.

2342
02:23:35,834 --> 02:23:52,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't check out WoW, went back to WoW, actually, but I did see the new logins frequency, the login screen, and that actually made me go,

2343
02:23:53,649 --> 02:23:54,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Wee, who?

2344
02:23:54,450 --> 02:23:55,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Big Frost Worm.

2345
02:23:56,691 --> 02:23:57,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.

2346
02:23:57,291 --> 02:23:58,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very pretty.

2347
02:23:58,092 --> 02:24:01,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... It's like... Yay, cute!

2348
02:24:01,314 --> 02:24:02,255
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got mushroomed.

2349
02:24:02,335 --> 02:24:04,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa, we just had a... We just got hit by a flying mushroom.

2350
02:24:04,176 --> 02:24:06,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Behave, boys and girls in the studio.

2351
02:24:06,197 --> 02:24:07,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, our guests are getting unruly.

2352
02:24:07,618 --> 02:24:08,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

2353
02:24:09,340 --> 02:24:11,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well... Mushrooms are funny.

2354
02:24:11,741 --> 02:24:12,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Mushroom growing in your head.

2355
02:24:12,942 --> 02:24:13,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2356
02:24:13,883 --> 02:24:14,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

2357
02:24:14,863 --> 02:24:15,924
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a little distracted here.

2358
02:24:15,984 --> 02:24:17,525
[SPEAKER_07]: People are throwing things at each other in the studio.

2359
02:24:19,546 --> 02:24:20,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, go ahead.

2360
02:24:21,127 --> 02:24:29,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, other than that, well, I'm starting to get sort of in one way pissed also, since at the current state, I have no TV whatsoever.

2361
02:24:30,550 --> 02:24:31,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

2362
02:24:31,910 --> 02:24:45,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but then again, and that's starting to annoy me, really, since I want to play on my retro, I'm sort of almost really utterly want to play on my PS1, so...

2363
02:24:50,290 --> 02:24:53,373
[SPEAKER_08]: since I haven't played on that one for a long time.

2364
02:24:54,393 --> 02:24:58,297
[SPEAKER_08]: And, well, I want to play Front Vision 3, damn it!

2365
02:25:00,358 --> 02:25:05,943
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, you could do that whole thing where you download things to the PSP, but I don't know if they have that game on there.

2366
02:25:06,243 --> 02:25:09,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a PSP yet, that's the thing.

2367
02:25:10,086 --> 02:25:18,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And with the thing that the Model 3 has come out, and with the problem that that's causing...

2368
02:25:19,953 --> 02:25:23,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorta like, now, just wait.

2369
02:25:24,376 --> 02:25:26,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, uh, just wait as usual, so.

2370
02:25:28,118 --> 02:25:28,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2371
02:25:28,878 --> 02:25:35,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, Aki Ripper, we gotta, uh, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but, uh, good luck on the quest for the television.

2372
02:25:35,202 --> 02:25:39,845
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, uh, I, I, I, on my short, on short notice, in one way, in one way.

2373
02:25:41,047 --> 02:25:45,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought of when I was starting to listen to OLR, and it was... That was weird.

2374
02:25:45,369 --> 02:25:47,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Skype just crashed on us in the middle of that call.

2375
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:49,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you heard the remix.

2376
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:50,731
[SPEAKER_07]: That was strange.

2377
02:25:51,532 --> 02:25:53,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear I didn't do anything to provoke that.

2378
02:25:54,193 --> 02:25:54,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2379
02:25:54,733 --> 02:25:58,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if somebody else is on the line, I'll go to voicemail right away.

2380
02:25:59,835 --> 02:26:00,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to sign back in.

2381
02:26:00,735 --> 02:26:02,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry to Aki Ripper, who got cut off.

2382
02:26:02,656 --> 02:26:03,616
[SPEAKER_07]: That was weird.

2383
02:26:04,257 --> 02:26:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: That was very weird.

2384
02:26:05,831 --> 02:26:08,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, well, I guess we're open for business again.

2385
02:26:08,673 --> 02:26:13,535
[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR What?

2386
02:26:14,336 --> 02:26:14,536
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2387
02:26:15,696 --> 02:26:25,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Rice Princess just sent me a text, and she says, Tell everyone I said hi, and I said my love, and congrats on 300, and also... Alright, that's lovely.

2388
02:26:25,862 --> 02:26:26,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2389
02:26:27,043 --> 02:26:27,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2390
02:26:28,043 --> 02:26:28,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we have another call.

2391
02:26:28,944 --> 02:26:30,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2392
02:26:30,044 --> 02:26:30,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2393
02:26:31,285 --> 02:26:32,426
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kitsune.

2394
02:26:32,726 --> 02:26:33,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Kitsune.

2395
02:26:33,686 --> 02:26:34,407
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on your mind?

2396
02:26:38,439 --> 02:26:39,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, thank you very much.

2397
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:42,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you calling us from inside your own Sackboy outfit?

2398
02:26:42,761 --> 02:26:43,801
[SPEAKER_07]: You sound very distant.

2399
02:26:45,161 --> 02:26:47,482
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm calling from Japan.

2400
02:26:48,683 --> 02:26:49,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

2401
02:26:49,243 --> 02:26:51,583
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess maybe that might be part of the distance.

2402
02:26:51,623 --> 02:26:52,904
[SPEAKER_22]: We chat on AIM sometimes.

2403
02:26:53,084 --> 02:26:53,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right on.

2404
02:26:53,844 --> 02:26:54,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.

2405
02:26:54,144 --> 02:26:57,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's been going on in your gaming world this week?

2406
02:26:58,706 --> 02:27:02,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the other week I went to Tokyo Game Show, which was really exciting.

2407
02:27:03,087 --> 02:27:04,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell us about that.

2408
02:27:04,107 --> 02:27:04,988
[SPEAKER_07]: How was Tokyo Game Show?

2409
02:27:05,008 --> 02:27:05,968
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of stuff did you see there?

2410
02:27:07,242 --> 02:27:09,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was huge and very exciting.

2411
02:27:09,544 --> 02:27:10,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of people.

2412
02:27:11,246 --> 02:27:13,608
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest booth is probably Xbox 360.

2413
02:27:14,689 --> 02:27:17,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think Xbox 360 is going to turn around in Japan?

2414
02:27:18,353 --> 02:27:19,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.

2415
02:27:19,414 --> 02:27:24,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had a pretty big booth and tons of people waiting in line.

2416
02:27:24,619 --> 02:27:27,001
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a 105 minute wait for one game.

2417
02:27:27,422 --> 02:27:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, what game was that?

2418
02:27:30,425 --> 02:27:31,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was...

2419
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:36,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of not surprised at that, yeah?

2420
02:27:36,221 --> 02:27:40,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that would be the game that is supposed to cater to the Japanese audience.

2421
02:27:40,725 --> 02:27:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2422
02:27:42,267 --> 02:27:44,449
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why E3 can't go public, you guys.

2423
02:27:44,469 --> 02:27:47,431
[SPEAKER_07]: 105 minute waits just to play one RPG?

2424
02:27:47,672 --> 02:27:50,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine what those Wii lines would have looked like if it was open to the public.

2425
02:27:50,494 --> 02:27:51,475
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been nutso.

2426
02:27:52,076 --> 02:27:52,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2427
02:27:53,897 --> 02:27:54,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2428
02:27:55,279 --> 02:27:56,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you're having a good time.

2429
02:27:57,878 --> 02:28:00,939
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a DS game I want to talk about called Time Hollow.

2430
02:28:01,439 --> 02:28:01,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2431
02:28:01,839 --> 02:28:06,941
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a Japanese game, but it was just released in the States, and it is amazing.

2432
02:28:07,021 --> 02:28:17,265
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever heard of Shadow of Destiny for the PlayStation 1, it's much like that game in which you have to change the past, and then it causes something else to change, but you've got to go back and change again.

2433
02:28:17,945 --> 02:28:23,388
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has real anime videos throughout the whole game, and I loved it.

2434
02:28:23,948 --> 02:28:26,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds kind of like a puzzle game, but with anime cutscenes?

2435
02:28:28,833 --> 02:28:29,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a puzzle game.

2436
02:28:30,934 --> 02:28:31,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an adventure game.

2437
02:28:33,675 --> 02:28:34,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

2438
02:28:34,255 --> 02:28:37,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Meltdown's calling it Butterfly Effect the game.

2439
02:28:38,657 --> 02:28:39,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

2440
02:28:39,897 --> 02:28:40,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2441
02:28:40,577 --> 02:28:41,558
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

2442
02:28:42,698 --> 02:28:43,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2443
02:28:43,078 --> 02:28:44,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I might have to check that out.

2444
02:28:44,579 --> 02:28:51,341
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's a lot of these games that really don't show up on the radar like that that I wish would get more coverage so I know to look out for them.

2445
02:28:53,595 --> 02:28:55,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much and I'll check out Time Hollow for sure.

2446
02:28:55,976 --> 02:28:56,436
[SPEAKER_01]: You take care.

2447
02:28:56,456 --> 02:28:56,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

2448
02:28:56,576 --> 02:28:56,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.

2449
02:29:20,203 --> 02:29:22,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I like getting phone calls from far, far, far away.

2450
02:29:22,945 --> 02:29:23,225
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2451
02:29:24,465 --> 02:29:27,707
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2452
02:29:27,767 --> 02:29:28,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.

2453
02:29:29,608 --> 02:29:30,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2454
02:29:30,609 --> 02:29:30,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's this?

2455
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:36,292
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's a random bitch that finally got her 360 this week.

2456
02:29:36,532 --> 02:29:37,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, who's this?

2457
02:29:39,253 --> 02:29:39,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Misty.

2458
02:29:39,954 --> 02:29:40,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Misty.

2459
02:29:40,674 --> 02:29:43,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, Misty, did you say you finally actually got a 360 this week?

2460
02:29:46,109 --> 02:29:47,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, finally.

2461
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:50,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I migrated my account since the day I got the system.

2462
02:30:07,796 --> 02:30:08,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to send me a message.

2463
02:30:10,358 --> 02:30:14,000
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the same gamertag from last time, my LJ name, so you're already on my list.

2464
02:30:15,101 --> 02:30:16,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, that's right, that's right, that's right.

2465
02:30:16,762 --> 02:30:18,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I forgot you had the old Xbox.

2466
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:20,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that I hardly ever saw you on there.

2467
02:30:20,385 --> 02:30:21,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, cool.

2468
02:30:21,926 --> 02:30:23,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what games did you get for 360?

2469
02:30:23,808 --> 02:30:23,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh...

2470
02:30:27,777 --> 02:30:29,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Main one was Portal's Still Alive.

2471
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:33,242
[SPEAKER_21]: I caved and downloaded Beat and Groovy for the fuck of it.

2472
02:30:33,262 --> 02:30:34,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not worth it.

2473
02:30:34,483 --> 02:30:34,863
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

2474
02:30:34,883 --> 02:30:36,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not downloaded Beat and Groovy.

2475
02:30:49,176 --> 02:30:51,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have a couple good songs in it, but the price tag sucks.

2476
02:30:52,119 --> 02:30:53,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It only has a couple songs in it.

2477
02:30:53,841 --> 02:30:54,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

2478
02:31:09,125 --> 02:31:16,491
[SPEAKER_07]: I admit I haven't been paying attention much I've been too busy with the stuff I have got Well you need to pay more attention to our show young lady No I'm just kidding it's cool

2479
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:46,645
[SPEAKER_07]: it's all good come on you have a shitty attention span I know so any chance of a Misty visit in the future?

2480
02:31:49,707 --> 02:32:06,318
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm working on it I wasn't feeling good before that dentist appointment I had the other day so I had to postpone it a pay period so yeah I still want to I just don't know when at least there's always Xbox Live to connect us in the meantime alright Misty any other quick thoughts before we let you go?

2481
02:32:09,353 --> 02:32:09,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Not really.

2482
02:32:10,254 --> 02:32:10,554
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2483
02:32:10,574 --> 02:32:11,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, have a good one, Missy.

2484
02:32:11,375 --> 02:32:11,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Enjoy the new 360.

2485
02:32:11,795 --> 02:32:14,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

2486
02:32:15,198 --> 02:32:15,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2487
02:32:17,239 --> 02:32:19,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

[SPEAKER_07]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is Bobby.

2493
02:32:27,647 --> 02:32:29,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from a far off place called Atlanta.

2494
02:32:29,617 --> 02:32:43,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Far Off Place I don't know if I've ever heard of Atlanta No, hey Bobby, I'm glad you called in Worst airport ever We're always calling into your show in a way No, no, no Philadelphia is the worst airport Really?

2495
02:32:44,322 --> 02:32:49,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Dallas Dallas is cakewalk Y'all have never been to Philly Compared to Atlanta's airport?

2496
02:32:49,283 --> 02:32:57,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Philly, Chicago Bobby, you always let us call into your show but you're never on ours What's on your mind, Bobby?

2497
02:32:59,039 --> 02:33:02,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, I was just calling in to congratulate you on 300.

2498
02:33:02,941 --> 02:33:05,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a question for you guys about your show.

2499
02:33:05,623 --> 02:33:08,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you see yourself at episode 400?

2500
02:33:09,545 --> 02:33:10,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Canceled.

2501
02:33:11,906 --> 02:33:12,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody had to say it.

2502
02:33:13,527 --> 02:33:14,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do we see ourselves at episode 400?

2503
02:33:16,008 --> 02:33:16,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.

2504
02:33:16,769 --> 02:33:18,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let Loki start.

2505
02:33:20,987 --> 02:33:22,308
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com.

2506
02:33:39,645 --> 02:33:40,345
[SPEAKER_05]: systems.

2507
02:33:41,126 --> 02:33:44,427
[SPEAKER_07]: I think honestly in two years it'll be kind of about the next round of systems.

2508
02:33:44,947 --> 02:33:50,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll try to do our best to maintain to stay on the cutting edge of interactive tools.

2509
02:33:50,609 --> 02:33:54,250
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you will see Orange Launch Radio getting into video more in two years.

2510
02:33:54,770 --> 02:33:56,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily that we're going to be.

2511
02:33:56,111 --> 02:33:57,131
[SPEAKER_22]: The hell we will.

2512
02:33:57,631 --> 02:33:58,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in the way you think.

2513
02:33:59,212 --> 02:34:01,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily it'll be our mugs reading the news.

2514
02:34:01,512 --> 02:34:04,093
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be furries!

2515
02:34:04,613 --> 02:34:04,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

2516
02:34:05,474 --> 02:34:08,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the way folks interact with us I think will be different.

2517
02:34:10,530 --> 02:34:29,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I just you know because you know we were one of the first shows to really jump on Skype when that first came out and you know Justin TV we weren't really the first but you know that was a way to kind of expand through that and you know we like to try to stay on the cutting edge of how to stay interactive with the listeners so you know it's it's hard to think of what hasn't been done yet I don't know

2518
02:34:32,312 --> 02:34:35,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that Sackboy costume have fur on it?

2519
02:34:35,794 --> 02:34:37,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count as a furry for you?

2520
02:34:37,194 --> 02:34:37,934
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

2521
02:34:38,395 --> 02:34:38,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

2522
02:34:39,095 --> 02:34:39,755
[SPEAKER_07]: It's stuff.

2523
02:34:39,975 --> 02:34:41,596
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like sweatshirt material.

2524
02:34:41,676 --> 02:34:43,536
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a giant sweatshirt is what it is.

2525
02:34:43,836 --> 02:34:44,737
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not furry though.

2526
02:34:46,277 --> 02:34:47,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And no Tingle hat on it?

2527
02:34:47,938 --> 02:34:49,098
[SPEAKER_07]: No Tingle hat this time.

2528
02:34:49,218 --> 02:34:53,180
[SPEAKER_07]: But we figured this is the closest the listeners are ever going to get to seeing Loki in a Tingle outfit.

2529
02:34:53,240 --> 02:34:56,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to take what you can.

2530
02:34:57,168 --> 02:35:05,293
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because from what I can understand, Loki likes Sackboy, so it's not as fun to see him dressed up as that as it would be to see him dressed up as Tingle.

2531
02:35:05,413 --> 02:35:06,813
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still adorable!

2532
02:35:07,234 --> 02:35:08,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can't help it.

2533
02:35:08,094 --> 02:35:11,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone hasn't sold another 800,000 copies of something, you know?

2534
02:35:11,916 --> 02:35:12,877
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on it!

2535
02:35:13,217 --> 02:35:14,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's write friends forever.

2536
02:35:14,858 --> 02:35:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting billboards up for it.

2537
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:19,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

2538
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:24,583
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a PlayStation 3 now, so I can add Loki to my friends list, so you don't have to be Loki's only friend anymore, Bobby.

2539
02:35:24,643 --> 02:35:25,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I have more than one friend now.

2540
02:35:26,596 --> 02:35:27,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have you know.

2541
02:35:27,116 --> 02:35:28,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he dumped me as his only friend.

2542
02:35:29,298 --> 02:35:32,500
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some other people that actually had LittleBigPlanet already that were playing it.

2543
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:34,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I could play at them because the servers aren't up yet.

2544
02:35:34,801 --> 02:35:35,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Till tomorrow.

2545
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:36,322
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be up tomorrow.

2546
02:35:36,462 --> 02:35:36,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck yeah.

2547
02:35:39,084 --> 02:35:39,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait.

2548
02:35:39,924 --> 02:35:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, Bobby, now that you're on the R-rated show, is there anything you want to say about Guitar Hero World Tour you didn't get to say on your show?

2549
02:35:49,861 --> 02:35:55,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I see, when you added that I didn't get to say on my show, that kind of cut it out.

2550
02:35:56,204 --> 02:36:10,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the drums fucking suck, and maybe next time Activision really should kind of look at their own equipment before they badmouth the other ones and say, hey, when theirs breaks, you can come by ours, because it won't break.

2551
02:36:11,370 --> 02:36:12,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2552
02:36:12,610 --> 02:36:14,691
[SPEAKER_07]: It won't break, because it's already broken.

2553
02:36:14,871 --> 02:36:18,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you thought about checking out Rock Revolution's drum set, just to see if it's better?

2554
02:36:20,827 --> 02:36:22,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't think it's out yet, actually.

2555
02:36:22,871 --> 02:36:24,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, even though the game's out?

2556
02:36:24,615 --> 02:36:30,608
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is out, but the drum set's not out until November because apparently they haven't quite figured out the manufacturing of that either.

2557
02:36:32,844 --> 02:36:40,049
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've played on the drum kit a couple times, but no, the actual drum set's not in stores yet.

2558
02:36:40,089 --> 02:36:40,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the game.

2559
02:36:41,129 --> 02:36:49,154
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want to know is, the drums weren't, I mean, I don't think I didn't get to play it, but it didn't seem that the drums were broken when they were showing it off.

2560
02:36:49,474 --> 02:36:50,015
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

2561
02:36:50,075 --> 02:36:50,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, seriously.

2562
02:36:51,796 --> 02:36:52,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Mass production.

2563
02:36:52,816 --> 02:36:53,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, yeah.

2564
02:36:54,264 --> 02:37:02,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Rock Band was first shown at the PAX that you guys weren't at the year before, they started out with like three...

2565
02:37:17,327 --> 02:37:20,730
[SPEAKER_02]: and they had one by the end of the weekend.

2566
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:25,713
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could actually see the other drum sets all bandaged up in the corner of the booth.

2567
02:37:25,773 --> 02:37:26,433
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of sad.

2568
02:37:26,813 --> 02:37:28,374
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad, depressed, broken machines.

2569
02:37:29,275 --> 02:37:42,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had Dan Teasdale on... I was doing an interview with him for my show from the booth and I asked him about the durability of the drum sets and while I was asking the question, I looked at the pile of depressed drum sets and he didn't take the bait.

2570
02:37:43,863 --> 02:37:47,384
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not seen a single post from anybody that says, my drums work perfectly.

2571
02:38:13,561 --> 02:38:22,104
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say that there's none that aren't effective, but either they're too busy playing the game or they just don't post on forums or whatever.

2572
02:38:22,684 --> 02:38:25,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has some sort of problem with the drums.

2573
02:38:27,346 --> 02:38:27,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2574
02:38:28,326 --> 02:38:35,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess it's a good thing I don't buy these games for the drum parts because I'm just not good at drums, so I always buy them for guitars.

2575
02:38:35,649 --> 02:38:38,790
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, if I ever was interested in doing it someday, that's kind of depressing.

2576
02:38:39,310 --> 02:38:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2577
02:38:40,959 --> 02:38:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I mean, I guess now I've got to do the whole RMA process, but I'm kind of worried, you know, have they fixed it yet?

2578
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:56,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of these threads, you know, I've looked on the official Guitar Hero forums, which I know are mostly negative because the people only post there when they're pissed or can't play.

2579
02:38:57,783 --> 02:39:01,683
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've said, you know, one guy said, I've returned it three times.

2580
02:39:01,823 --> 02:39:03,344
[SPEAKER_02]: My store has no more.

2581
02:39:03,804 --> 02:39:07,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single drum set that I've gotten from the store has a different pad that's broken.

2582
02:39:08,265 --> 02:39:08,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang.

2583
02:39:09,346 --> 02:39:09,766
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

2584
02:39:39,459 --> 02:39:46,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of insinuate that it's Harmonix's fault that you're trying to play Guitar Hero in a specific way.

2585
02:39:47,122 --> 02:39:48,483
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way that works?

2586
02:39:49,443 --> 02:39:50,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

2587
02:39:50,064 --> 02:39:55,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's weird because ordinary drums, they just seem to make noise whenever I hit them.

2588
02:39:57,505 --> 02:40:08,855
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Bobby, and it's kind of funny coming from you because I know you're essentially a professional drummer and, you know, it's just kind of funny that, gee, a professional drummer isn't playing the drums right, apparently.

2589
02:40:10,171 --> 02:40:13,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you have to smack it really hard for it to register.

2590
02:40:14,014 --> 02:40:17,956
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say, well, you may need to hit a pad harder or you may need to hit them softer.

2591
02:40:18,157 --> 02:40:20,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, not in that sense.

2592
02:40:20,698 --> 02:40:26,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't have to hit the right pad three times as hard as the middle pad and stuff.

2593
02:40:26,703 --> 02:40:31,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I even plugged in my professional drum kit, which I've been passing around photos.

2594
02:40:32,146 --> 02:40:33,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, that photo is hilarious.

2595
02:40:33,407 --> 02:40:33,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2596
02:40:35,135 --> 02:40:40,161
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to post that photo in chat because it's hilarious seeing all your equipment practically on top of each other.

2597
02:40:40,522 --> 02:40:43,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to ask you though real quick, what about the guitar with the game?

2598
02:40:43,745 --> 02:40:47,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Because for those of us that aren't so much into drums or guitars, have you played around with that at all?

2599
02:40:48,411 --> 02:40:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I play around a little bit with the guitar and I am happy to report that my guitar looks like it has absolutely no problem.

2600
02:40:55,333 --> 02:41:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: now that being said I don't really understand the point of that slider thing the tutorial shows you how to use it and it doesn't work all the time but I think it's because I'm doing it wrong not because the hardware sucks but it's kind of like the lower fret notes in Rock Band I'll never use it there's things that you can do with it now one of the things is that is your wah-wah

2601
02:41:21,619 --> 02:41:49,564
[SPEAKER_02]: so instead of using the whammy bar for things that maybe you don't have star power you can actually run your hand along that and it does the wah-wah thing which is kind of cool and I did that a couple times just for the novelty factor but the guitar feels fine and they actually did add one of the actual software things for people that didn't buy the guitar that they added to World Tour is that now you can have one note held down and then you can strum down a second note

2602
02:41:50,205 --> 02:41:50,845
[SPEAKER_02]: and a third note.

2603
02:41:50,865 --> 02:41:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll do chords that kind of come on like that.

2604
02:41:52,746 --> 02:41:57,468
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not hammer-ons, but you still have to keep one note held down while you bring the second one in.

2605
02:41:57,908 --> 02:41:58,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

2606
02:41:58,608 --> 02:41:58,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

2607
02:41:59,568 --> 02:42:03,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm still using a Guitar Hero 2 Explorer in all my games.

2608
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:05,291
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only controller I have.

2609
02:42:05,631 --> 02:42:07,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's time for me to get a new one.

2610
02:42:07,651 --> 02:42:08,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be interesting.

2611
02:42:10,712 --> 02:42:13,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, people are asking, how's the actual game?

2612
02:42:13,473 --> 02:42:18,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been spending most of the day trying to get the game to work, so I haven't really gotten too far in the game.

2613
02:42:18,775 --> 02:42:28,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I will say that apparently the storyline behind the game, according to the intro screen, is Kenny G comes out and hypnotizes everybody, and it's your job to unhypnotize everybody.

2614
02:42:29,119 --> 02:42:31,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's such a Guitar Hero story.

2615
02:42:32,181 --> 02:42:33,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that's fake.

2616
02:42:34,583 --> 02:42:37,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's the opening cinematic.

2617
02:42:37,145 --> 02:42:47,852
[SPEAKER_02]: A guy with a clarinet comes out and hypnotizes the entire crowd, and so the GH symbol flashes on everybody's cell phone and watch and stuff, and they all converge to unhypnotize the crowd.

2618
02:42:47,912 --> 02:42:52,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, aren't they going to feel stupid when they release Clarinet Hero later on?

2619
02:42:54,237 --> 02:42:57,259
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Bobby, we've got to let you go so we can wrap our show.

2620
02:42:57,299 --> 02:42:58,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any last thoughts?

2621
02:43:00,839 --> 02:43:04,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you people who brag about your hardware that doesn't work.

2622
02:43:05,264 --> 02:43:05,645
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2623
02:43:06,266 --> 02:43:07,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care, Bobby.

2624
02:43:07,447 --> 02:43:08,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, guys.

2625
02:43:08,288 --> 02:43:10,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't have gotten here without you, Bobby.

2626
02:43:10,631 --> 02:43:11,412
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

2627
02:43:11,873 --> 02:43:12,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Take care.

2628
02:43:12,393 --> 02:43:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make you late in two weeks.

2629
02:43:14,436 --> 02:43:14,997
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2630
02:43:15,337 --> 02:43:15,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2631
02:43:17,443 --> 02:43:18,484
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, anything?

2632
02:43:18,504 --> 02:43:18,564
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

2633
02:43:18,584 --> 02:43:18,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki then?

2634
02:43:41,232 --> 02:43:45,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Just real quick, there was a little big planet download that was added in for Japan.

2635
02:43:46,114 --> 02:43:48,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that game Ape Escape?

2636
02:43:48,815 --> 02:43:55,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you can download a costume for your Sackboy that's actually the ape in the game, which is kind of funny.

2637
02:43:56,399 --> 02:44:00,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Army of Two is supposed to be getting a movie as well.

2638
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:00,761
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

2639
02:44:00,801 --> 02:44:05,062
[SPEAKER_05]: We hear a lot of these movies that are coming out, but none of them come out except for Max Payne.

2640
02:44:06,183 --> 02:44:07,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they're all next year?

2641
02:44:07,323 --> 02:44:09,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all talk until it actually happens.

2642
02:44:10,345 --> 02:44:10,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2643
02:44:11,707 --> 02:44:14,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it, I guess, for last-minute stories.

2644
02:44:14,189 --> 02:44:19,313
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, one other quick little dedication here Drew Nami wants to do, and then we're going to go around and get final thoughts tonight.

2645
02:44:19,533 --> 02:44:20,935
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of sad news.

2646
02:44:21,635 --> 02:44:25,598
[SPEAKER_03]: For the WoW players that remember the forums, remember Ezra Chatterton.

2647
02:44:26,699 --> 02:44:39,550
[SPEAKER_03]: He was contacted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation because he had a brain tumor and talked to Blizzard and had some things customized for him, had a few weapons dedicated to him, had an entire...

2648
02:44:41,138 --> 02:44:49,666
[SPEAKER_03]: and the entire few characters and questlines in his honor passed away on Monday, October 20th, from a stroke.

2649
02:44:51,949 --> 02:44:54,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And our thoughts are with them.

2650
02:44:54,926 --> 02:44:56,747
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's very unfortunate.

2651
02:44:57,007 --> 02:45:06,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I know there was a lot of people that actually went in and did the Will You Find My Dog quest that day, just kind of like to... Because that was his quest, and his voice is still in the game.

2652
02:45:06,933 --> 02:45:15,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very interesting that, you know, despite what's happened offline, he kind of will continue to live on online, which is really neat.

2653
02:45:15,418 --> 02:45:16,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a nice dedication.

2654
02:45:16,339 --> 02:45:17,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Something only a video game could do.

2655
02:45:19,241 --> 02:45:21,502
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that is a very sad note to end Episode 300 with, so...

2656
02:45:23,423 --> 02:45:25,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Can somebody make a fart joke or something to bring us back?

2657
02:45:26,026 --> 02:45:26,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

2658
02:45:26,566 --> 02:45:26,846
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

2659
02:45:27,087 --> 02:45:27,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Dongle.

2660
02:45:28,708 --> 02:45:29,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Ross Princess.

2661
02:45:30,690 --> 02:45:31,390
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you.

2662
02:45:32,331 --> 02:45:32,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

2663
02:45:32,912 --> 02:45:34,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hey, we still have the final thoughts.

2664
02:45:35,094 --> 02:45:36,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And here, wait, here.

2665
02:45:36,935 --> 02:45:40,839
[SPEAKER_07]: This always makes everything better, guys, if you're feeling a little down here.

2666
02:45:41,940 --> 02:45:42,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how to make everything better.

2667
02:45:44,882 --> 02:45:45,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, hold on.

2668
02:45:47,565 --> 02:45:48,666
[SPEAKER_07]: This always makes everything better.

2669
02:45:51,603 --> 02:45:52,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

2670
02:45:57,318 --> 02:45:58,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, yes, it's good to be back.

2671
02:46:22,279 --> 02:46:24,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that you know where the studio is, feel free to come back sometime.

2672
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:24,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

2673
02:46:26,482 --> 02:46:31,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make sure there's a show first, because I've had that happen where we cancel the show for a night and someone showed up anyway.

2674
02:46:33,286 --> 02:46:33,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor guy.

2675
02:46:34,647 --> 02:46:36,608
[SPEAKER_07]: The Doctor, do you have anything you want to say?

2676
02:46:37,128 --> 02:46:38,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Glub, glub, glub, glub.

2677
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:42,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Hiccup Boy, any final thoughts?

2678
02:46:43,572 --> 02:46:44,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a coral reef.

2679
02:46:45,854 --> 02:46:46,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Crikey.

2680
02:46:48,649 --> 02:46:51,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew Nami, anything you want to leave the listeners with tonight?

2681
02:46:51,753 --> 02:46:52,654
[SPEAKER_07]: You got some red on you.

2682
02:46:55,157 --> 02:46:56,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, final thought.

2683
02:46:59,221 --> 02:47:02,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to win my costume contest at work, I think.

2684
02:47:04,988 --> 02:47:05,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

2685
02:47:06,455 --> 02:47:15,243
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is, since we're not doing another show before Election Day, please, please, please vote.

2686
02:47:15,984 --> 02:47:19,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And please, please, please, if you're in California, vote no on Prop 8.

2687
02:47:20,027 --> 02:47:23,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do, you'll never have to hear me talk about it again.

2688
02:47:23,671 --> 02:47:25,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also believe you should vote no on 4.

2689
02:47:25,893 --> 02:47:28,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell, I'd give you my entire political opinions.

2690
02:47:28,835 --> 02:47:31,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one about parental notification.

2691
02:47:31,218 --> 02:47:31,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

2692
02:47:32,278 --> 02:47:33,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote yes for the monorail.

2693
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:37,763
[SPEAKER_22]: I voted no on damn near everything except the monorail.

2694
02:47:39,524 --> 02:47:46,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, even the presidential election pales in comparison to what rights are in store with Prop 8, but that, obviously, I'm a little biased.

2695
02:47:46,910 --> 02:47:47,990
[SPEAKER_07]: You can probably understand why.

2696
02:47:48,971 --> 02:47:51,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, your final thought.

2697
02:47:51,493 --> 02:47:52,434
[SPEAKER_22]: Reject false icons.

2698
02:47:53,399 --> 02:47:53,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Well said.

2699
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:54,860
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2700
02:47:55,401 --> 02:47:57,543
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.

2701
02:47:57,663 --> 02:48:00,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Wherever you guys are on Wednesday, please send some happy thoughts my way.

2702
02:48:00,585 --> 02:48:01,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to need them.

2703
02:48:01,626 --> 02:48:03,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And send a dollar to DarkSakura because she wants them.

2704
02:48:04,428 --> 02:48:09,432
[SPEAKER_07]: And send some copies of Eye of Judgment to Loki because maybe you'll get an even better costume for episode 400.

2705
02:48:09,492 --> 02:48:11,014
[SPEAKER_07]: You never know unless you try.

2706
02:48:11,935 --> 02:48:13,196
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do this all again next week.

2707
02:48:13,236 --> 02:48:15,838
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about our show.

2708
02:48:16,138 --> 02:48:18,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Word of mouth is how we spread the word about our program.

2709
02:48:19,915 --> 02:48:21,096
[SPEAKER_07]: But for now, that's going to do it.

2710
02:48:21,576 --> 02:48:23,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Leave us a nice review on iTunes or something.

2711
02:48:24,077 --> 02:48:24,558
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of here.

2712
02:48:24,858 --> 02:48:26,338
[SPEAKER_07]: See you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2713
02:48:26,459 --> 02:48:27,259
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be back in two weeks.

2714
02:48:44,108 --> 02:48:46,612
[SPEAKER_26]: or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
