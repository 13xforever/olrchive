1
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:32,407
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:32,567
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

3
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,314
[SPEAKER_10]: As if we weren't running late already.

4
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

5
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:09,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's try that again.

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,016
[SPEAKER_10]: From the top.

7
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:10,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Take two.

8
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:14,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The following program is intended for mature audiences.

9
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:38,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo introduces their winner lineup in a new DS, ACDC comes to Rockband in a Walmart expansion disc,

10
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:46,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers Hi

11
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:16,925
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing?

12
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:17,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

13
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:19,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, she's here.

14
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:20,008
[SPEAKER_10]: She's kicking.

15
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,649
[SPEAKER_10]: She's feisty.

16
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully we'll hear some feisty snark a little later.

17
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:25,512
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't know.

18
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:26,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just talking you up.

19
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,955
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll also say, actually kind of boring tonight in reality.

20
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:29,816
[SPEAKER_03]: See, there's feisty.

21
00:02:29,836 --> 00:02:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

22
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I knew you had it in you.

23
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,322
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

24
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:40,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

25
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:40,823
[SPEAKER_10]: How you doing, Loki?

26
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:41,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

27
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:42,084
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

28
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:43,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you feeling feisty tonight?

29
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,026
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm starting to get a hang, though.

30
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:46,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:47,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it something in the air?

32
00:02:48,027 --> 00:02:48,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it what you ate?

33
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,570
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably allergies or an X-strain.

34
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,450
[SPEAKER_10]: That's too bad.

35
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,731
[SPEAKER_11]: That's usually the one of the two.

36
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:54,731
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

37
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,037

[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was a lot of Ragnarok, as usual.

40
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:00,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Addict.

41
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.

42
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:04,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Mr. World of Warcraft.

43
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:06,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, when was the last time I said on this show I played World of Warcraft?

44
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:08,069
[SPEAKER_04]: When's the last time you actually did?

45
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:09,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Today.

46
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

47
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,911
[SPEAKER_10]: But wait a minute.

48
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.

49
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Yesterday was the first time in like three weeks.

50
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,212
[SPEAKER_10]: So give me a break.

51
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I also watched game shows.

52
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:19,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

53
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:20,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Namely the VP debate.

54
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:23,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Who wants to be a vice president?

55
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know.

56
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:34,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, I won't get into it, but I actually was moderately disappointed in one party and moderately impressed by the other party, even though I thought they both were kind of...

57
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:43,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this, we like to keep our eyes on gaming blogs around the internet and the things they're reporting and of course I'm sure you guys have heard about Kotaku.

58
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:46,197
[SPEAKER_10]: They just ran a story that's towards the top of their feed.

59
00:04:46,217 --> 00:04:48,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it got pushed at 5 o'clock today.

60
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:50,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarah Palin in video games.

61
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,444
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you haven't seen this article, I'm going to link it to you guys here in chat.

62
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:55,285
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know,

63
00:04:55,825 --> 00:05:07,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Democrat, Republican, Independent, I don't care who you are, you've probably seen the jokes about Sarah Palin, and hopefully no matter where you stand, you have a sense of humor about it.

64
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:13,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at this, they put her face on all these different famous video game shots, like there's Tomb Raider, Sarah.

65
00:05:14,532 --> 00:05:15,753
[SPEAKER_10]: and here's Metroid.

66
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarah is Samus.

67
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,574
[SPEAKER_04]: The Metroid one actually looks cool.

68
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:19,354
[SPEAKER_10]: And Cortana.

69
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:20,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, actually they're not bad.

70
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,336
[SPEAKER_10]: The Photoshop jobs are actually pretty good.

71
00:05:22,816 --> 00:05:26,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta say my favorite one though is, you know that one, Move Every Zig right there.

72
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:29,339
[SPEAKER_10]: God, what the hell was that game?

73
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:30,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, your base or belong to us.

74
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero Wing.

75
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero Wing, yeah.

76
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:32,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

77
00:05:34,028 --> 00:05:35,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that's great.

78
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:35,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Very nice.

79
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Alaskan Avengers.

80
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:40,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can check that out.

81
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:43,975
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's on Kotaku, but I think it originally comes from a site called Pwn or Die.

82
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:45,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

83
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:46,697
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it.

84
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Get your politics on.

85
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, no matter where you are, though, just vote.

86
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Freaking vote in November.

87
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,262
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like someone's cosplay photo, the same as one.

88
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:54,830
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

89
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:19,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Band

90
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,749
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:09,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on an objects in space project and I'm doing a pinball machine.

92
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:22,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

93
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,861
[SPEAKER_04]: For my art class.

94
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:24,761
[SPEAKER_04]: My teacher thought it was a cool idea.

95
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to take pictures and blog it?

96
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm going to... Put it on your Twitter?

97
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make prints of it.

98
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:30,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

99
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:35,031
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't turn out like utter crap like I feel it will, but... We still have the space.

100
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:36,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been too lazy on JustinTV.

101
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:40,916
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pointing to the space where I kept saying I was going to get the GameStop whiteboard.

102
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:42,418
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

103
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Things that suck about GameStop or something like that we were going to do?

104
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,103
[SPEAKER_10]: And we still have the space, so we could have a picture of it.

105
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:54,466
[SPEAKER_04]: My husband's told me in no uncertain terms that I have to have it preserved forever.

106
00:07:54,626 --> 00:08:06,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So I figured, because I was going to do something for a pinball room, so I figured I could do it for the pinball room, get a grade for it, and maybe people might like it.

107
00:08:06,192 --> 00:08:06,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

108
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:07,292
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

109
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:07,992
[SPEAKER_10]: They just might.

110
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Week was alright.

111
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I played, of course, Saints Row, the first one, quite a bit because live's been fucked up.

112
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:28,939
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

113
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Any chance of an Earth Defense Force 2018 someday?

114
00:08:58,918 --> 00:08:59,259
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

115
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, what else did I play?

116
00:09:03,102 --> 00:09:06,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I also played Mercenaries 2 some more.

117
00:09:06,765 --> 00:09:09,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Did another co-op session with my friend.

118
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:10,148
[SPEAKER_11]: That was pretty fun.

119
00:09:12,298 --> 00:09:15,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And then of course, the big one I've been playing this week, Saints Row 2.

120
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:17,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, this game is awesome.

121
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:32,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, if you're going to compare Saints Row 2 to Grand Theft Auto 4, I think the real thing that kind of stands out is this game is a lot more fun, I guess.

122
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:32,824
[SPEAKER_11]: It's...

123
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:38,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Right from the get-go, very over-the-top, very just fun to play.

124
00:09:39,452 --> 00:09:40,793
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's campy fun?

125
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:50,795
[SPEAKER_11]: It is kind of campy fun, but I'm playing right now through one of the gang missions, through the Brotherhood, which is one of the three, well, technically four gangs in the game.

126
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:55,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just keeps getting more fucked up as you play it.

127
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but...

128
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:00,904
[SPEAKER_11]: They kind of are getting back at each other.

129
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:08,592
[SPEAKER_11]: One does something to the other group and in return they retaliate with something even more harsh.

130
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:10,233
[SPEAKER_11]: It's getting nuts.

131
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:17,447
[SPEAKER_11]: But the game, it's got a lot of really good radio stations on the actual vehicles and stuff.

132
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,048
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a lot of good licensed music.

133
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:21,069
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, their 80s station is fucking awesome.

134
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:25,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you say something on your Twitter about crashing while you were listening to some song?

135
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:33,177
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, we were flying in a biplane, buzzing over a freeway, shooting at cars while listening to Land From Down Under.

136
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's just...

137
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:37,100
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just so crazy.

138
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot that catches you off guard.

139
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:45,584
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a mission that there is a direct reference to Jack Thompson in.

140
00:10:47,418 --> 00:10:49,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a lot of really fun stuff.

141
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,260
[SPEAKER_11]: And, I mean, this game has literally made me forget about Grand Theft Auto 4.

142
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,560
[SPEAKER_11]: It's that good.

143
00:10:54,981 --> 00:11:00,903
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, first I must say, though, the graphics in the game, they are a step up from the first game.

144
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:08,605
[SPEAKER_11]: The glitches, there are still some glitches in this game, and some pretty bad ones at times.

145
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:14,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there'll be nothing that really stops the game from working, just kind of like, huh.

146
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:15,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's Loki playing Saints Row 2.

147
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:19,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll kill you!

148
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,090
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll kill you all!

149
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,330
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna die!

150
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,699
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, going back to the glitches.

151
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:42,620
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why we have a chat room.

152
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:56,064
[SPEAKER_11]: There was one time where I had blown up a bunch of stuff during a Mayhem mission, and when I came back after the mission was done, the park benches hadn't respawned, but people were still sitting down like there was benches there.

153
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:07,447
[SPEAKER_11]: There was another one where I was watching a cutscene with some vehicles or whatever in a caravan, and each one of the vehicles in the caravan ran into a telephone pole that was on the corner because they were...

154
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:11,910
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like the AI is sort of off a little bit, like in their paths.

155
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,573
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like off slightly.

156
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:21,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there'll be another move you can do with a samurai sword where you can literally stab someone up through their throat, but it's too high.

157
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:24,521
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're stabbing above them and it just reacts.

158
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:25,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Like up the nose?

159
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,143
[SPEAKER_11]: No, like above their head.

160
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:31,266
[SPEAKER_11]: It just acts like you're reacting to hitting them, but it's not quite right.

161
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:32,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the release version?

162
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:33,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

163
00:12:33,228 --> 00:12:34,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but here's the thing.

164
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:36,869
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter, though.

165
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still early awesome, and they have chainsaw kills just like Gears of War.

166
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:50,093
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like it's not going to be graphically the greatest game ever or the sound or whatever, but it's just for you, it's just fun.

167
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:52,333
[SPEAKER_10]: It's big, dumb, stupid, blow shit up fun.

168
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:52,833
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.

169
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,354
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like blow shit up the game.

170
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:55,834
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty much what it is.

171
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:56,574
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you've always wanted.

172
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:57,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

173
00:12:57,074 --> 00:13:01,996
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, that's pretty much what... If you're looking for a game that's supposed to be cutting edge and stuff...

174
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:03,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Lightening Lightening

175
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:34,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not touching Saints Row 2 until I finish 1, lol

176
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Redertainment in chat says, thank god for patches.

177
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,211
[SPEAKER_11]: How is the developer with patches?

178
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, pretty good, I guess.

179
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:19,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, last game they only did one patch on it, so it didn't really fix a lot of the glitches in it.

180
00:14:19,844 --> 00:14:22,724
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are still some glitches from the first game that you can do in this one.

181
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:32,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, for example, if you hop on top of a car and you hit the Y button to get in, you'll just instantly teleport inside the car, just like you could in the first game.

182
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:33,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

183
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:34,782
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

184
00:14:54,459 --> 00:15:15,227
[SPEAKER_11]: and um they have a whole the customization of the characters is just insane they've added so many different sliders I literally spent 40 minutes in this game um setting up my character to look like me so you know it's so elaborate with like actually taking pictures of my face and trying to get the proportions correct I don't know we'll see if it looks correct when uh we we actually show it off but uh

185
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,957
[SPEAKER_11]: You can make some really fucked up looking characters in this game though, seriously.

186
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:25,261
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's funny because they always comment to you, they're like, did you do something with your hair?

187
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,284
[SPEAKER_11]: That's their comment because you can be a totally different gender.

188
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:33,309
[SPEAKER_11]: But they have three different voices for male and female that you can pick from.

189
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:33,969
[SPEAKER_11]: You can pick your...

190
00:15:35,865 --> 00:16:03,330
[SPEAKER_11]: your stance, they have a taunt and they also have kind of like a compliment little gesture you can do they have everything for doing the little jig that what's her name did and to like Michael Jackson stuff I have my guy kind of doing the A for happy days and then my taunt is just flipping someone the bird that's funny nice

191
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:10,515
[SPEAKER_11]: but yeah, lots of customization, really fun game seriously you gotta check it out alright

192
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing some new games this week as well.

193
00:16:13,452 --> 00:16:15,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing the old standbys as well.

194
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:17,874
[SPEAKER_10]: World of Warcraft, as I mentioned DarkSakura earlier.

195
00:16:18,134 --> 00:16:21,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Just squeezing some more in before the new Wrath of the Lich King comes out.

196
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, I'm thinking I'm going to buy at 7-Eleven.

197
00:16:24,136 --> 00:16:27,858
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at 7-Eleven randomly because I was craving a Slurpee at like 2 o'clock in the morning.

198
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:31,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have a big old ad there for reserving games.

199
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Like Wrath of the Lich King and all these other... What else was coming out that they were pushing?

200
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:40,787
[SPEAKER_10]: and other sports games that were coming out and all this stuff.

201
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,470
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm thinking, who's going to buy their freaking games at 7-Eleven?

202
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,092
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be nobody there the night it launches.

203
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:46,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that might be where I go to get it.

204
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:47,335
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

205
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:52,321
[SPEAKER_10]: But also, there's a big, big content patch coming to Warcraft on Tuesday and it's going to change everything.

206
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:52,922
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the pre-

207
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:54,182
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

208
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:20,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

209
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,381
[SPEAKER_10]: New games I've been playing this week.

210
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:33,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Mega Man 9 finally came out on the Xbox 360, so I decided to pick it up because I wasn't going to get it on the Wii because I don't have the space.

211
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:39,225
[SPEAKER_10]: And then on PlayStation 3, I don't even have yet because LittleBigPlanet's not out, so I probably won't crack until next week and get a PlayStation 3.

212
00:17:40,105 --> 00:17:42,606
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did finally get Mega Man 9 on Xbox 360.

213
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:46,787
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fun, it's hard, it's retro, it's probably everything you've heard about.

214
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I will say this, the controls were not as bad as I was expecting.

215
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:52,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought the controls were going to be horrific on the Xbox 360.

216
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:53,850
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually isn't that bad.

217
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually able to use...

218
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,151
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:14,489
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

220
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:38,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Splash Woman stage, I probably played that like 25 times and died many, many times.

221
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,535
[SPEAKER_10]: But now I can get through it without dying because it's just about memorizing where you jump when.

222
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:43,636
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.

223
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,077
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all pattern memorization.

224
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:45,617
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

225
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:47,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma says, Wow.

226
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:48,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about that.

227
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's more of a res application actually.

228
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:00,881
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

229
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,127
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

230
00:19:48,823 --> 00:19:49,904
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just scary.

231
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:53,205
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you got the ambient music playing.

232
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,587
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually a track from Silent Hill 3, not the new game, but that's alright.

233
00:19:56,007 --> 00:20:00,649
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and I'm just walking around and everything's all dark and scary.

234
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:05,011
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll tell you what, this game totally relies on cheap thrills.

235
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:11,135
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like I'll be walking around and exploring, trying to find the other half of the x-ray so I can solve that first little puzzle.

236
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:12,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, BAM!

237
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:16,998
[SPEAKER_10]: A wheelchair falls down from the staircase and scares the fucking shit out of me.

238
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:19,219
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:41,881
[SPEAKER_10]: The graphics aren't quite as good as I would have expected for a next generation Silent Hill game, but it's by no means bad.

240
00:20:42,221 --> 00:20:46,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably on par with the last generation of games, but just a widescreen and a little bit crisper.

241
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,149
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw asks, when I saw Pyramid Head, was I scared and screaming with joy?

242
00:20:51,430 --> 00:21:01,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, I didn't get far enough because that night, seriously, after the wheelchair fell down the staircase, and my, no, I'm not even kidding with you, my front door blew open right after that happened.

243
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, fuck this, I can't play this game right now.

244
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,021
[SPEAKER_10]: So I turned it off.

245
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:07,602
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried playing a little more.

246
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I played for about another 90 minutes the next day.

247
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And I noticed there was a distinct lack of save points.

248
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,346
[SPEAKER_10]: But I got through the first little area and got to another one.

249
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,666
[SPEAKER_10]: But I haven't gotten to Pyramid Head yet.

250
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,448
[SPEAKER_10]: That tells you I'm not that far in the game at all.

251
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:24,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't give a full review to this game because I haven't really seen enough of it.

252
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,972
[SPEAKER_10]: But I definitely can already tell it's worthy of being a Silent Hill game.

253
00:21:27,992 --> 00:21:30,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you like cheap scares, you'll enjoy it.

254
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:35,335
[SPEAKER_10]: HendersonMan in chat says, Silent Hill looks better than that Siren crap.

255
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:36,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't get into Siren.

256
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:46,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say, though, in the very, very beginning of the game is one of those places where it starts to turn from day to night.

257
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:48,846
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, good Silent Hill, Dark Silent Hill, or whatever you want to call it.

258
00:21:49,246 --> 00:21:50,087
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's creepy.

259
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:51,468
[SPEAKER_10]: It is very creepy.

260
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:52,889
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's pretty much the same.

261
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:53,750
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a cinematic.

262
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,831
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really something that happens live as is going on.

263
00:21:55,851 --> 00:21:56,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

264
00:21:56,812 --> 00:21:59,834
[SPEAKER_10]: Henderson Man does confirm that the save points are few and far between.

265
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:03,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So, when you see a save point in Silent Hill, cherish it.

266
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:11,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, from what I understand, the game does kind of auto-save as you go, so that if you do die, you don't have to go all the way back to your last save point.

267
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:13,725
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you turn it off, you do.

268
00:22:14,026 --> 00:22:15,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there you go.

269
00:22:15,787 --> 00:22:17,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm having fun with Silent Hill Homecoming.

270
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,469
[SPEAKER_10]: I will play more of it this week.

271
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not when I'm home by myself, though.

272
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:21,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's a little bit scary.

273
00:22:21,832 --> 00:22:23,053
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit scary.

274
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:24,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

275
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:44,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget to check us out on LiveJournal at username OrangeLounge or our Facebook, the OL Army.

276
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:49,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Just search for OL Army under groups or our MySpace at username OrangeLoungeRadio or the Twitter at OLR.

277
00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:54,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's four different social networking sites and four different names that we have on each of them.

278
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:57,792
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a real problem with consistency here at Orange Lounge Radio.

279
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,413
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight.

280
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:05,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Part A tonight is almost all Nintendo news.

281
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:06,115
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is.

282
00:23:06,275 --> 00:23:09,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's that little press conference they had just dominated the news this week.

283
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:11,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons and tons of Nintendo news.

284
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where we're going to start tonight.

285
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:12,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Loki?

286
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:13,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

287
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,382
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, the big news coming out of Nintendo's press conference was that they're announcing the brand new revision for the DS.

288
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:21,642
[SPEAKER_11]: DSi

289
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, the system has two cameras on it.

290
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:48,293
[SPEAKER_11]: A 0.3 megapixel camera, which will be facing the user, kind of in between the one touch screen and the other screen there.

291
00:23:49,254 --> 00:23:53,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, there is a 1.3 megapixel camera on the outside.

292
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:55,819
[SPEAKER_11]: The screens are slightly larger now.

293
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:56,420
[SPEAKER_11]: They're 3.25 inches wide.

294
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:06,030
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can also sync your photos with the Wii Photo Channel and also it will include a free web browser application built inside as well.

295
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:10,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, just like the rumor said, you can play back your music on there.

296
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:12,316
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be using AAC...

297
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,821
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.

298
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:39,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Not getting it for a while, unfortunately.

299
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:42,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, because they hate us?

300
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:43,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, because they hate us.

301
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:47,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And because they say that the DS is selling so well over here.

302
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:52,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Not anymore, now that you announced a brand new version that will be coming out next year, stupid.

303
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:53,817
[SPEAKER_11]: God.

304
00:24:56,317 --> 00:25:04,860
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, the other big thing about it is there will be a new DSi shop where you'll be able to download games, kind of like WiiWare, but for the DS.

305
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the games range from free to about 800 points.

306
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:12,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of cool.

307
00:25:13,314 --> 00:25:22,619
[SPEAKER_10]: You're obviously the homebrew fan on this show, and Tigerclaw in chat says the DS homebrew community are going to pretty much find ways to hack the DSi since they can use the SD cards to do all sorts of things.

308
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:23,139
[SPEAKER_10]: True?

309
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:23,480
[SPEAKER_10]: False?

310
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,500
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, definitely.

311
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,883
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the memory card thing will definitely help.

312
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, the fact that there's cameras built into it.

313
00:25:34,265 --> 00:25:37,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming there's going to be a little bit more RAM built into it as well.

314
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:38,288
[SPEAKER_11]: It just...

315
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:53,161
[SPEAKER_11]: it's not going to be that hard especially since it has to play all the other DS cartridges so at the very least it will still work the way the DS does as far as homebrew stuff goes so does this mean you're going to kind of want one?

316
00:25:54,076 --> 00:26:02,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the thing, though, that you have to understand, though, with this one, and I thought that they had onboard storage as well, like a little bit of onboard storage.

317
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:09,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be wrong, though, is that this one will probably be able to receive some sort of firmware updates, whereas the other ones weren't.

318
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:10,581
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

319
00:26:12,482 --> 00:26:14,503
[SPEAKER_10]: What if this didn't have the SD card slot on it?

320
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:17,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you still be as interested, or would it be not interested because there's no way to hack it?

321
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:18,904
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'd still be interested.

322
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:19,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

323
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:20,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you could still hack it.

324
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,185
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you just...

325
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:23,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Do it the way you're doing it now.

326
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:42,915
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm kind of wondering what other features they're going to have on there or how they're going to utilize different things.

327
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:51,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we have a lot of time, so we'll get to see what comes out in Japan first, I guess.

328
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Comments from chat room.

329
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:55,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Seg says, about the web browser, it's roundabout free.

330
00:26:56,023 --> 00:27:02,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Each DSi will get 500 Nintendo points, known as Wii points formerly, which can be used to buy the 500 point opera browser on the DSi.

331
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:05,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard about that whole 500 free points thing they were supposed to be doing.

332
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:06,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

333
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the web browser is just free anyways.

334
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:15,769
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like how it was when it came out over here, where it's free for a while and now they charge for it.

335
00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:17,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this comment too.

336
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to read this.

337
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,754
[SPEAKER_10]: TheRobD in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, says, Yay.

338
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:31,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to admit, I kind of agree.

339
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:33,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not that excited about this little device.

340
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:39,436
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, I've been jokingly calling it the DSiPhone because that's pretty much what it is but without the phone.

341
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:41,378
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like an iTouch.

342
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:46,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a DSiPhone, no, iPod Lite or Touch or whatever?

343
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:48,287
[SPEAKER_10]: An iTouch, yeah, DSiTouch or whatever you want to call it.

344
00:27:49,088 --> 00:28:03,686
[SPEAKER_10]: In my mind, that's kind of what they're trying to do with this whole download store thing is that it's kind of trying to mirror that applications thing that the iTouch or the iPhone does, which I don't think they're trying to copy or anything because this thing's probably been in development for a long, long time.

345
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,928
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't know.

346
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:05,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't –

347
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing.

348
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm going to have to get one anyway.

349
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:15,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know there's going to be that game that comes out at some point where you have to use the camera.

350
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:17,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo just freaking does this.

351
00:28:17,055 --> 00:28:18,796
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be some Mario game I'm going to want to get.

352
00:28:19,016 --> 00:28:24,299
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is as secure as the Wii was with their virtual console and their...

353
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:32,378
[SPEAKER_11]: WeWear Games I don't think we'll have to worry about spending money on the application store.

354
00:28:32,438 --> 00:28:33,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but hold on though.

355
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know, come on.

356
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:42,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't like to do that unless it's usually like import stuff or things you can't get here because, you know, I like to support stuff that's good.

357
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:43,432
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know...

358
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:47,854
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm wondering though if they haven't announced yet anything about the virtual console stuff.

359
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:52,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering if some virtual console games will be compatible with this because that would be kind of cool.

360
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:52,836
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

361
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:58,799
[SPEAKER_10]: That alone would actually make me seriously consider getting one because that would really justify all those purchases I've been making.

362
00:28:58,819 --> 00:28:59,419
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be awesome.

363
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:08,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because can you imagine download to your SD memory card slot or whatever for like maybe stop it at like Super Nintendo games or something like that.

364
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:14,586
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotten to the point where I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo because I'm like, well, yeah, that would be cool, but they're not going to do it.

365
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,228
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be an adapter that you're going to have to pay $40 for that'll do it.

366
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:24,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo just based on history at this point.

367
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:27,312
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't get excited about these types of things anymore.

368
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,133
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of sad.

369
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:32,015
[SPEAKER_10]: TigerClaw says, DSi also opens a new can of worms.

370
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:35,257
[SPEAKER_10]: People will be sharing very inappropriate photos with each other via PictoChat.

371
00:29:35,578 --> 00:29:35,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great.

372
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:45,525
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I go into the Penny Arcade Expo room at next year's PAX 09 and DSi or whatever, am I going to get cock shots all over my DS from people putting it down their pants and taking a picture?

373
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:47,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

374
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:49,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray.

375
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:51,309
[SPEAKER_10]: But... What?

376
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:53,270
[SPEAKER_03]: You might get boob shots, too.

377
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:53,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I might.

378
00:29:54,691 --> 00:29:55,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind that.

379
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:55,972
Ha ha ha!

380
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:14,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, if you want to chat on this, chat.orange.com Other things that were announced at Nintendo's press conference, speaking of SD cards, finally, and you know this has been a big thing for me lately, I've bitched and bitched and bitched and belly ached and cried and been a big baby about the fact that I do not believe I should have to

381
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:19,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Remove my games from the Wii to put them on a card and then bring them back.

382
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:21,182
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this whole slow process.

383
00:30:21,502 --> 00:30:25,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they just should address the stupid onboard storage problem on the Wii.

384
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And they finally have.

385
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:31,888
[SPEAKER_10]: You will finally be able to load channels directly from the SD cards in spring of 2009.

386
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:34,350
[SPEAKER_10]: The biggest duh in the world.

387
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,211
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing that we knew should have been there the whole freaking time.

388
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:39,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally they are installing in spring of 2009.

389
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:41,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is it taking until spring 2009?

390
00:30:41,894 --> 00:30:43,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Why can't they do it now?

391
00:30:43,155 --> 00:30:43,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean...

392
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they honestly didn't program it in to begin with.

393
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:52,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they're trying to close up homebrew loops with this too.

394
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you that's what they're trying to do.

395
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,843
[SPEAKER_10]: When they release this patch, they're going to do their damnedest to stop the exploiting.

396
00:30:57,863 --> 00:31:03,306
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to stop it, but I guess they feel they have an obligation to all the people that developed for their system to try.

397
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:05,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck with that.

398
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:09,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you should talk to Sony and see how well that went with them and the PSP.

399
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:14,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you think they owe it to their developers to try?

400
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:28,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they owe it to their developers to try, but I don't think it's really hurting them right now as far as it's not allowing... Well, I guess it could allow piracy, but so far the community has been good about keeping that out.

401
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:35,973
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do have a thing to load ISOs off of the memory cards or whatever, but it doesn't work really well.

402
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:38,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's why the update's taking forever.

403
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:43,675
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want you to copy stuff on your SD card, take it to your friend's house, and put it on their Wii.

404
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,016
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're having to come up with the whole, how are we going to get around this copy thing?

405
00:31:48,396 --> 00:31:49,277
[SPEAKER_10]: DRM, basically.

406
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:50,937
[SPEAKER_10]: They're implementing DRM.

407
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,998
[SPEAKER_10]: That's part of the testing, pushing this thing back.

408
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:54,778
[SPEAKER_11]: They already have DRM implemented.

409
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:00,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if you move channels... They're Nintendo.

410
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
[SPEAKER_11]: It takes them fucking forever to do something.

411
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,481
[SPEAKER_11]: There, that's it.

412
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:04,481
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll just leave it at that.

413
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:08,431
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also the masters of making us buy new things.

414
00:32:08,732 --> 00:32:09,312
[SPEAKER_10]: But guess what?

415
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:11,374
[SPEAKER_10]: To be fair, this is a free update.

416
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:17,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not something that's going to cost us any money, except for the fact that Nintendo-branded SD cards are always $10 more than the other ones.

417
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then don't buy them.

418
00:32:19,341 --> 00:32:19,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, don't.

419
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:27,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's the other thing that you're going to have a problem with, too, is they haven't announced that they're going to expand the number of channels you can have, so you're still fucked.

420
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:28,909
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to run out of channels eventually.

421
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:29,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

422
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,911
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe that's just kind of a given.

423
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:33,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to hold that against them yet.

424
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is a lot of space.

425
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:39,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe the thing's smart enough to fill in with more channels.

426
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:40,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

427
00:32:40,178 --> 00:32:41,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anybody ever filled the damn thing up?

428
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine it's possible.

429
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,281
[SPEAKER_10]: If you download nothing but Nintendo games.

430
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:44,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And what happens?

431
00:32:44,901 --> 00:32:45,582
[SPEAKER_10]: You just can't put it anymore?

432
00:32:45,602 --> 00:32:46,142
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't put it anymore.

433
00:32:46,362 --> 00:32:47,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that sucks.

434
00:32:48,684 --> 00:32:48,884
Huh.

435
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:49,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Patch!

436
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:51,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

437
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,848
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a part of this patch that you'll add new channels.

438
00:32:53,948 --> 00:32:55,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not getting negative about that yet.

439
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:56,150
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll see.

440
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,930
[SPEAKER_10]: More to come in 2009.

441
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:04,442
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as other things that are going to be coming out for the Wii, the Wii Speak channel was unveiled.

442
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:11,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii Speak is the microphone peripheral that's coming with Animal Crossing and is getting its own channel.

443
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:17,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's about all that we know right now, that it's just Wii Speak.

444
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:23,071
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's going to get its own channel though, so it's not something you're going to have to use Animal Crossing for.

445
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:29,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume, but there's no true details yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.

446
00:33:30,316 --> 00:33:35,699
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually thinking that something like that would work for them to do karaoke games.

447
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.

448
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:39,521
[SPEAKER_11]: That'd be interesting.

449
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Or just call your friend.

450
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously.

451
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:46,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, but... Do you really... Hold on, hold on.

452
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:48,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Long distance costs money.

453
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Minutes cost money.

454
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:52,347
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why VOIP is getting popular.

455
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,248
[SPEAKER_10]: So I...

456
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:57,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but most people have pretty decent phone plans.

457
00:33:57,626 --> 00:34:01,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, hell, people are spending like $100 a month on stupid unlimited plans.

458
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:08,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, my plan, which is dirt cheap, has unlimited nights and weekends and long distances included in there.

459
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:13,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, just... Okay, what if I want to talk to someone at 4 in the afternoon?

460
00:34:14,242 --> 00:34:15,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a cell phone.

461
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:17,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a landline.

462
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I don't have a landline either.

463
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:22,721
[SPEAKER_10]: But myself, I only have so many daytime minutes on myself.

464
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I want to talk to people.

465
00:34:23,782 --> 00:34:26,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe one other thing is that, you know, maybe I want to talk to rooms.

466
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, somebody can talk to a party.

467
00:34:28,506 --> 00:34:29,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I text.

468
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:30,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I text more than I talk on the phone.

469
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:34,010
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dan uses his phone pretty much only people who call him or business.

470
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,732
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get those rollover minutes and there you go.

471
00:34:37,121 --> 00:34:41,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Sagan Chat says, WeSpeak will also use friend codes for chatting with friends.

472
00:34:41,744 --> 00:34:45,266
[SPEAKER_10]: And follows up with, I don't know, WeSpeak would make a great room phone.

473
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Groups talking to groups.

474
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:47,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm saying.

475
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:48,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Network parties together.

476
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,209
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be its biggest benefit.

477
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,811
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I think the friend codes for WeSpeak is a given.

478
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:58,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot imagine a Nintendo place where you could go into a room and chat with strangers.

479
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:03,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine the potential for horrible stories that could come with that?

480
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, sad.

481
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:23,552
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to understand, they come up with these ideas.

482
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:24,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, that's too cool for our console.

483
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:29,395
[SPEAKER_10]: You could kind of do that on Xbox Live now, except you're going to have to settle for Fusion Frenzy 2.

484
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:35,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I put my phone on speaker and play Mario Party.

485
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:37,058
[SPEAKER_11]: In which case, I think I'd rather chew glass.

486
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,141
[SPEAKER_11]: There's always Vivo Pinata Party, which is slightly better.

487
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:45,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of chewing glass, Rob would want to chew plastic.

488
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:49,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Party is definitely the top tier, you know what I mean?

489
00:35:52,303 --> 00:35:52,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move on.

490
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,404
[SPEAKER_04]: We should make our own party game.

491
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:57,205
[SPEAKER_10]: What would an Orange Launch Radio party game be?

492
00:35:57,785 --> 00:36:00,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'd have your weirdo map all over the place.

493
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:01,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Get naked and tell your friends.

494
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:04,388
[SPEAKER_04]: No, like Mario Party, except you've got weapons.

495
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can get a tank.

496
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a Humvee with a rocket launcher on it.

497
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,231
[SPEAKER_10]: Mortal Kombat Party.

498
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:12,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and, and, and.

499
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:12,832
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

500
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the dice will have dirty commands on it.

501
00:36:16,113 --> 00:36:18,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be lots of guys making out.

502
00:36:20,623 --> 00:36:22,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, Lick, Kiss, Suck.

503
00:36:23,745 --> 00:36:27,347
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the dirty dice part of the game.

504
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to roll them for guys making out.

505
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:32,030
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

506
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, I think no one would buy this game.

507
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,052
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, exactly.

508
00:36:37,493 --> 00:36:41,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So, a game that someone might buy, Pikmin.

509
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:47,659
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actually doing a brand new series of games called Play on the Wii, or Wii Day Sobu.

510
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:48,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

511
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,882
[SPEAKER_11]: GameCube Games GameCube Games

512
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:18,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And didn't everybody say back then, oh, just you wait, here comes the tidal wave, everything will be re-released.

513
00:37:19,752 --> 00:37:30,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And sure enough, here they go, they're re-releasing Pikmin, basically the GameCube version with, you know, fuckin' Wii controls thrown in there, woohoo!

514
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:38,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, yeah, so that'll be the first game that's gonna be part of that, but, um...

515
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Never fear, though.

516
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:48,974
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not actually the Pikmin game they were talking about before, which Miyamoto alluded to.

517
00:37:49,074 --> 00:37:50,895
[SPEAKER_11]: He is actually making a new Pikmin game.

518
00:37:52,616 --> 00:37:55,737
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not like, hey, we're going to release a new Zelda game.

519
00:37:55,817 --> 00:37:56,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, just kidding.

520
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:57,438
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the old Zelda game.

521
00:37:57,798 --> 00:38:05,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually kind of okay with this whole re-releasing of games things because you know everybody has that one game that they want out of this.

522
00:38:05,503 --> 00:38:06,583
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, it's F-Zero.

523
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:09,845
[SPEAKER_10]: and maybe there's people that won't win Waker.

524
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:10,365
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

525
00:38:10,405 --> 00:38:12,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't there something on GameCube?

526
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:14,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Or what about Metroid Prime 1 and 2?

527
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,389
[SPEAKER_10]: There's got to be something you want out of this.

528
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:17,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, Loki?

529
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:17,930
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

530
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe win Waker, but that's it.

531
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:24,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, the Pikmin game is coming out December 25th in Japan.

532
00:38:25,134 --> 00:38:29,616
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be available for 3,800 yen, and that's approximately 36 bucks U.S.,

533
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:34,823
[SPEAKER_11]: and also some other games that are going to be coming later on.

534
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:42,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo's going to be releasing Donkey Kong Jungle Beat apparently on... Okay, that doesn't make any sense.

535
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:43,600
[SPEAKER_11]: But with the lack of beat.

536
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:52,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I guess before Pikmin, even though this was supposedly the first game, but Donkey Kong Jungle Beat will be coming out on December 11th in Japan.

537
00:38:52,774 --> 00:39:02,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Also coming soon will be Chibi-Robo Pikmin 2, Mario Tennis, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2, and... Of course, of course.

538
00:39:02,997 --> 00:39:03,437
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

539
00:39:03,597 --> 00:39:06,758
[SPEAKER_11]: No word on release dates for the rest of those, but...

540
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:14,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's kind of cool, I guess, because the Wii certainly doesn't have enough GameCube ports.

541
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,273
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

542
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:18,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm currently depressed.

543
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:20,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

544
00:39:20,154 --> 00:39:21,755
[SPEAKER_10]: While Loki was reading that story, what happened?

545
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:26,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I pulled my DS out of my purse because I was looking for something, and the corner broke off.

546
00:39:26,437 --> 00:39:27,078
[SPEAKER_10]: How did that happen?

547
00:39:27,118 --> 00:39:27,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

548
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:29,219
[SPEAKER_04]: It must have gotten broken in my purse.

549
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,199
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

550
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I have to get a DSi now.

551
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's what she does.

552
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:35,892
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but she's totally serious.

553
00:39:35,912 --> 00:39:36,673
[SPEAKER_10]: She was just showing it.

554
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:37,914
[SPEAKER_10]: The corners, like, snapped off.

555
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:39,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'll put it on the camera.

556
00:39:39,735 --> 00:39:41,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that how you get the husband to buy you new toys?

557
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:42,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, Dan, I broke it.

558
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:43,918
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just get toys anyway.

559
00:39:43,938 --> 00:39:44,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

560
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:45,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan, I broke it.

561
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:46,040
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

562
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a new one.

563
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:50,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, you know, I have a... No, I can fix this with duct tape and silicone glue.

564
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,665
[SPEAKER_10]: There ain't nothing duct tape can't fix.

565
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:53,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, just look at it.

566
00:39:53,806 --> 00:39:55,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I can fix it with silicone glue.

567
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:59,269
[SPEAKER_11]: If you guys want these games, why don't you just buy the original GameCube games?

568
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:00,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, they do play on the Wii.

569
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,351
[SPEAKER_11]: But enhanced Wii controls.

570
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:04,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

571
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:12,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you known any games that the controls actually enhance the playability?

572
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:19,219
[SPEAKER_11]: How many people prefer to play on the GameCube controller for Mario Kart and Smash Bros.?

573
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it really enhancing stuff?

574
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, no.

575
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,781
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just going to get people to...

576
00:40:25,345 --> 00:40:45,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why more of their products and it's an excuse they're saying look we're still releasing first party products oh but they are remakes what if the games are only 20 bucks that's about how much a lot of the GameCube games still cost like the old Smash Brothers if they're 20 bucks then awesome hmm alright would you consider buying them if they were only 20 bucks no

577
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,246
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura is currently showing off that the DS does still work over on our Justin.TV feed, which you can see at Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.

578
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:56,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Meanwhile, back to more news about the DSi.

579
00:40:56,968 --> 00:41:02,072
[SPEAKER_10]: And earlier, Loki had mentioned that there's going to be a store that's opening up, and that's why I kind of joked that it's the DSi phone.

580
00:41:02,112 --> 00:41:07,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is opening up, and they've already announced what the first few games are going to be available on the DSi shop.

581
00:41:07,576 --> 00:41:08,056
[SPEAKER_10]: And guess what?

582
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:11,679
[SPEAKER_10]: They are games that you can already get in a traditional card format.

583
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2.

584
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,001
[SPEAKER_10]: But, but, but...

585
00:41:16,022 --> 00:41:16,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

586
00:41:37,794 --> 00:42:04,226
[SPEAKER_10]: because you know before too long in this DSi shop it'll be download new games for Brain Age not like necessarily a full blown Brain Age 3 but like download new brain training sequences as if they were rock band songs you know it's coming right that's why they're doing this they want a piece of the microtransaction pie and the Wii wasn't really set up to handle it very well even though I guess maybe Rock Band 2 is going to have it after all but still hmm

587
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:07,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

588
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:08,054
[SPEAKER_10]: The DS is out there.

589
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:09,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons and tons of people have one.

590
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,276
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a hugely popular system.

591
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:12,977
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a broken one!

592
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:14,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's bring microtransactions to it.

593
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:16,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get you to buy another DS system.

594
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:19,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe Nintendo will sell you some duct tape for 500 Nintendo points.

595
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:25,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Because really, the DS is just kind of like an upgraded Game Boy Advance, and how many times have they tried to get you to buy the Game Boy?

596
00:42:27,205 --> 00:42:27,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

597
00:42:28,466 --> 00:42:28,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Too many.

598
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:32,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, but... I have to get another one now.

599
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:39,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And besides, with them releasing a new system like the DSi, they can release Mario, Super Mario Bros.

600
00:42:39,094 --> 00:42:41,936
[SPEAKER_11]: DSi, and Mario Kart DSi.

601
00:42:42,056 --> 00:42:42,937
[SPEAKER_04]: How about CSi DSi?

602
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:43,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob?

603
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,451
[SPEAKER_04]: How about CSI DSI?

604
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:49,932
[SPEAKER_10]: CSI DSI, I like that idea.

605
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:52,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be like a major awesome marketing point.

606
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:52,833
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be awesome.

607
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:54,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

608
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:55,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to weep.

609
00:42:56,135 --> 00:42:56,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

610
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:57,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm weeping inside of my soul.

611
00:42:58,216 --> 00:42:58,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

612
00:42:58,416 --> 00:42:59,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're DS?

613
00:42:59,517 --> 00:42:59,937
[SPEAKER_04]: I am.

614
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:02,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we have a moment of silence please?

615
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:03,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

616
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:04,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, there we go.

617
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferret would like to make a statement on behalf of my poor, broken, like me, DS.

618
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And what could that be?

619
00:43:16,257 --> 00:43:16,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Game News!

620
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:18,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Sin and Punishment 2!

621
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:20,698
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming on Wii.

622
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

623
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:29,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting because Sin and Punishment 1 was never really released in the US.

624
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,520
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of interesting.

625
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it was.

626
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,260
[SPEAKER_04]: We got it on Virtual Console.

627
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, years later on Virtual Console.

628
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,341
[SPEAKER_10]: That thing must have sold real well for them to want to bring that out over here.

629
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:40,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's an interesting game to dig out of the archives.

630
00:43:42,062 --> 00:43:43,182
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty badass looking, though.

631
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, is that something you might be interested in picking up?

632
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

633
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking pretty cool to me.

634
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted the first one to come out, although we didn't pick up the Nintendo 64 one online, but, you know.

635
00:43:54,143 --> 00:43:58,444
[SPEAKER_10]: You can always maybe get an import one of the real thing, but they're probably hard to come by at this point.

636
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:58,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I doubt it.

637
00:43:58,845 --> 00:43:59,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them.

638
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:00,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen carts.

639
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:04,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get imported Nintendo 64 carts for not bad.

640
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:05,807
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

641
00:44:07,028 --> 00:44:12,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, hey, if they release a demo or something or I can play a little bit of it, maybe I'll buy it.

642
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:12,750
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks interesting.

643
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,351
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

644
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:46,691
[SPEAKER_11]: and by earning points by purchasing their games and I guess accessories, I'm not really sure about that, you will be able to trade those points in for Neato rewards like different accessories that are exclusive to the program.

645
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:50,274
[SPEAKER_11]: You might remember in Japan they did some of those Game & Watch DS games.

646
00:44:50,434 --> 00:44:53,957
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a Tingle Balloon Flight game or Balloon Fight.

647
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:57,020
[SPEAKER_11]: There was that weird...

648
00:44:58,339 --> 00:44:59,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Power Rangers looking thing.

649
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

650
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,400
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, lots of exclusive stuff.

651
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,121
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's pretty cool.

652
00:45:04,481 --> 00:45:07,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully we don't get lame shit on our side, you know.

653
00:45:07,943 --> 00:45:10,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they may have Club Nintendo and it's like, stickers!

654
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:13,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Temporary tattoos!

655
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:14,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Plastic rings!

656
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:15,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Wallpapers!

657
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:15,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

658
00:45:15,945 --> 00:45:16,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario underwear!

659
00:45:16,946 --> 00:45:17,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

660
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:19,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was...

661
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:26,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I've registered a lot of old Nintendo games on Nintendo's official site just in case something like this ever happened.

662
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:27,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I going to get credit for that?

663
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:28,888
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're not.

664
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:31,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'm not registering anything else until this comes out.

665
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:33,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I bought Wii Fit this week.

666
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,731
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter because there's going to be something different.

667
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:41,072
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a different Club Nintendo thing that you're going to have to register and not the actual games themselves.

668
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:45,434
[SPEAKER_10]: But isn't that where the whole... Isn't that where I get the points from?

669
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:47,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but that's going to be something separate.

670
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:50,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, then why should I continue to register?

671
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Why should you continue to buy anything from them?

672
00:45:52,776 --> 00:45:53,436
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I say.

673
00:45:53,696 --> 00:45:55,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if they put out a good game, I'm going to buy it.

674
00:45:55,877 --> 00:45:58,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted Wii Fit anyway, because I'm fat.

675
00:45:59,018 --> 00:46:00,678
[SPEAKER_10]: So... Rob!

676
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:01,098
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

677
00:46:02,798 --> 00:46:03,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here.

678
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:04,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Stand up.

679
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:05,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Stand up.

680
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:06,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Put your microphone down.

681
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Stand up.

682
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Come this way, because I'm not getting up.

683
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:11,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold out your hand.

684
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:13,901
Ow!

685
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:16,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, STFU.

686
00:46:18,703 --> 00:46:19,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever, I need to tone.

687
00:46:20,504 --> 00:46:21,184
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're not fat.

688
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:29,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, now that I've been abused during this program.

689
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:31,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not abuse, it's chastisement.

690
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we please move on with gaming news?

691
00:46:33,412 --> 00:46:34,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's me, hey.

692
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:35,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Rob.

693
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:36,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, the game The Conduit.

694
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:42,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of people have been looking forward to this because it's all sci-fi, futuristic-y, first-person shooter-y.

695
00:46:42,157 --> 00:46:43,157
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, it's on the Wii.

696
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:53,974
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, here's the weird thing, the Conduit was announced at the press event that it's going to be an exclusive first party shooter.

697
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:55,576
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because she's a dumbass.

698
00:46:55,636 --> 00:46:57,098
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people got really excited about it.

699
00:46:57,138 --> 00:46:58,440
[SPEAKER_10]: Who do we mean by she, Loki?

700
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:00,087
[SPEAKER_11]: The dumbass.

701
00:47:00,327 --> 00:47:06,811
[SPEAKER_11]: The one that talks about snowboarding and her son is so awesome because he makes cards for her.

702
00:47:06,972 --> 00:47:07,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Cammy Dunaway.

703
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:09,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the dumbass.

704
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:11,635
[SPEAKER_10]: So, here's the thing.

705
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:19,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, it was called a first-party title, but then, a little later, apparently, it actually was retracted.

706
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:22,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo is not actually publishing the conduit.

707
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,206
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew right away that she was an idiot when she said that.

708
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:28,168
[SPEAKER_11]: It said first party shooter.

709
00:47:28,188 --> 00:47:29,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, she meant first person shooter.

710
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,131
[SPEAKER_11]: She's just dumb.

711
00:47:32,573 --> 00:47:32,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

712
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:36,477
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, I wouldn't be surprised if they picked this up.

713
00:47:36,557 --> 00:47:39,040
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that they should anyways because...

714
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:41,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, man.

715
00:47:41,782 --> 00:47:42,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

716
00:47:43,323 --> 00:47:45,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the only concern would be that they're competing with themselves.

717
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:47,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it really matter?

718
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:52,188
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is it just like the ad dollars and the marketing push that will come out of it, depending on who picks it up?

719
00:47:52,208 --> 00:47:53,389
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, who's got the money to sell it?

720
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:54,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess.

721
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,192
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to change a damn thing about the game itself, right?

722
00:47:58,632 --> 00:47:59,312
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's not.

723
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:03,795
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just that if there's a publisher, then it means it's coming out sooner.

724
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:05,016
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, you know, that.

725
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:09,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't understand why anyone wouldn't publish this game anyways.

726
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:13,957
[SPEAKER_11]: There's been so much hype around it, and Nintendo's been pushing it so much anyways, and they don't have a publisher yet.

727
00:48:15,078 --> 00:48:19,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's kind of retarded to be pushing a game that's not going to be coming out anytime soon, but whatever.

728
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:23,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

729
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:26,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, this looks like something, and you've talked about this game before.

730
00:48:26,824 --> 00:48:29,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you care who publishes it, or you hate the game, or what?

731
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:30,406
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I don't care.

732
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:31,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

733
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then let's move on.

734
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:39,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Ian, remember that we talked about the game that even a penguin could play?

735
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:40,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

736
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:42,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And, Rob, you like penguins.

737
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:43,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I love penguins.

738
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, that's why you should be running Linux.

739
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:46,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

740
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, I like penguins just not that much.

741
00:48:49,311 --> 00:48:49,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

742
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:51,632
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you should be wearing tuxedos, Rob.

743
00:48:51,812 --> 00:48:53,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, and that's why I should live in Antarctica.

744
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should eat tuna.

745
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,016
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's warm water penguins.

746
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:12,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the Penguin game is actually made by Yuji Naka that's called Let's Tap, which is, and it has nothing to do with penguins, I think.

747
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:13,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Like tap dancing?

748
00:49:14,174 --> 00:49:26,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I guess it's supposed to be another kind of, I guess, I don't know if it's a music kind of game, but you use the Wiimote face down.

749
00:49:27,523 --> 00:49:39,853
[SPEAKER_11]: You basically, the game is played by facing the Wiimote, you put it face down on something, a surface, and you hit that surface with your fists, and it makes the Wiimote bounce, and you use that in different little mini-games.

750
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:43,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

751
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I continue with my story, too?

752
00:49:46,798 --> 00:49:50,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Let's Tap sounds like a tap-dancing game to me.

753
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:52,482
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you remember this.

754
00:49:52,502 --> 00:49:53,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

755
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:04,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, also, first of all, had I not been interrupted, I would have actually said something about... Oh!

756
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,009
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we do on this show.

757
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:07,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what else?

758
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:18,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the other game is one called 428, which is a game that uses real photos of people in the city with text on it.

759
00:50:19,551 --> 00:50:24,032
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was actually shown in the whole show role thing that they did at the conference.

760
00:50:24,992 --> 00:50:25,892
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be out in December.

761
00:50:26,428 --> 00:50:27,509
[SPEAKER_11]: National Penguin Day No, I made that up

762
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:56,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see.

763
00:50:57,539 --> 00:50:58,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's read a book.

764
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:00,000
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be a game that comes out on DS.

765
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's read a book.

766
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get edumacation.

767
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:05,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's watch television instead.

768
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:08,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with Let's Read a Book.

769
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:10,483
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, some of the stuff that they come out with...

770
00:51:11,963 --> 00:51:12,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Weird!

771
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:13,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's poop.

772
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:13,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

773
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:21,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So, anyways, there were some other announcements that they made during the second day of their press event.

774
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And these were, of course, new WiiWare games.

775
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:31,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And, of course, the first one, which I think they've already talked about before, Tetris Party.

776
00:51:32,076 --> 00:51:33,957
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a brand new Tetris game.

777
00:51:34,017 --> 00:51:36,659
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, there's modes in it that kind of look like Luminous a bit.

778
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:37,620
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

779
00:51:39,454 --> 00:51:51,283
[SPEAKER_11]: They're actually going to even have a mode where it's called squat mode where you play using your ass on the Wii balance board and you drop your pieces that way.

780
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:56,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like hearing you squat and drop your pieces.

781
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:00,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I pay good money for my Wii.

782
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:04,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

783
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:05,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

784
00:52:06,655 --> 00:52:07,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they went there.

785
00:52:09,035 --> 00:52:09,861
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course...

786
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,181
[SPEAKER_11]: There's another game which they're comparing to LittleBigPlanet.

787
00:52:14,442 --> 00:52:15,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, no.

788
00:52:16,022 --> 00:52:17,063
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not even close.

789
00:52:17,523 --> 00:52:22,406
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's called Boings because there's a Z at the end because that's hip and cool.

790
00:52:23,847 --> 00:52:29,570
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from the company Ninja Bees who have put out a bunch of other games which all seem to look similar to each other.

791
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:35,092
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess they were saying that this game is kind of LittleBigPlanet meets LocoRoco.

792
00:52:36,053 --> 00:52:39,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a 2D, 3D puzzler platformer.

793
00:52:40,395 --> 00:52:53,437
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's going to be I guess it follows these elastic creatures who are called the Boings and they can be grabbed and stretched and flicked across 30 levels of the game.

794
00:52:54,578 --> 00:53:02,179
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess the game should be coming out pretty soon because it's just been submitted to Nintendo for approval and should be out either October 20th or 27th.

795
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:07,520
[SPEAKER_11]: It is no LittleBigPlanet though, that's for sure.

796
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,001
[SPEAKER_11]: But seriously, all their games look similar.

797
00:53:13,742 --> 00:53:15,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the Tetris one kind of looks interesting.

798
00:53:16,824 --> 00:53:17,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

799
00:53:17,404 --> 00:53:17,825
[SPEAKER_10]: It's neat.

800
00:53:18,705 --> 00:53:21,187
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, we were talking about Tapit, obviously, a little bit ago.

801
00:53:21,287 --> 00:53:23,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Our chat room broke out in a game of Bop It.

802
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,842
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

803
00:53:48,113 --> 00:53:54,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I was trying to look for a clip of that commercial on YouTube to play in the background, but all I could find were commercials for Kidz Bop.

804
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:55,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to play those on the air.

805
00:53:55,778 --> 00:53:57,519
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of frightening.

806
00:53:57,959 --> 00:53:59,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine if there was a Kidz Bop sing star?

807
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:06,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we've got to wrap up the Nintendo Press Conference, but there are so many more games we didn't even begin to talk about, like Punch-Out!

808
00:54:07,305 --> 00:54:08,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Punch-Out!

809
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:11,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, a new WarioWare game is coming out, Mario & Luigi 3.

810
00:54:12,668 --> 00:54:17,011
[SPEAKER_10]: We have some of the other games that were coming out announced for the Wii...

811
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:20,180
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a Clonoa remake, apparently.

812
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Or it might be a new... No, it's a remake.

813
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Door to Phantomville.

814
00:54:24,123 --> 00:54:24,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Clonoa!

815
00:54:24,784 --> 00:54:25,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Clonoa!

816
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,766
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a karaoke game coming from Hudson.

817
00:54:27,987 --> 00:54:28,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Punch Out!

818
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:32,551
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't even talk about that, but it looked like in the previews there was King Hippo was back in it.

819
00:54:32,891 --> 00:54:33,531
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I heard you.

820
00:54:35,513 --> 00:54:38,556
[SPEAKER_10]: A game called Cosmic Walker, which is a spacewalking game.

821
00:54:39,216 --> 00:54:41,478
[SPEAKER_10]: A memory game called Start with 100 Words.

822
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:43,780
[SPEAKER_10]: But Clonoa... Remember these 100 words or you die!

823
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:51,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean, the sequel to Endless Ocean was also announced.

824
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:58,807
[SPEAKER_10]: And, and, and, some video from Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time that connects the DS to the Nintendo Wii.

825
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,448
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't this supposed to be a launch title?

826
00:55:01,629 --> 00:55:02,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Clonoa.

827
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

828
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:04,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

829
00:55:05,673 --> 00:55:07,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Trace Memory, also known as another code.

830
00:55:09,396 --> 00:55:35,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Wand of Magic an action RPG that's all on the Wii and then of course plenty of crap on the DS as well including Mario and Luigi RPG 3 and another WarioWare game and a 3D version of Picross supposed to come out as well wow that sounds boring and a fortune telling game you remember the old taboo game on the NES I remember Klonoa I'm gonna kill you in your sleep

831
00:55:36,773 --> 00:55:38,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Jamie, Jamie, this game's right up your alley.

832
00:55:38,975 --> 00:55:41,837
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great.

833
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:42,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what is this?

834
00:55:42,978 --> 00:55:44,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode.

835
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,201
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a fashion game from Nintendo.

836
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:46,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But Klonoa.

837
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,803
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Klonoa's not in it.

838
00:55:49,243 --> 00:55:49,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Klonoa.

839
00:55:51,205 --> 00:55:52,866
[SPEAKER_04]: That game has a sad bummer ending.

840
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:55,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Spoiler!

841
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:59,071
[SPEAKER_10]: This show's going to have a bummer ending if you don't shut up about Klonoa.

842
00:55:59,331 --> 00:56:00,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Voldemort kills Klonoa.

843
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:01,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

844
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:04,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Klonoa sounds like a sexually transmitted disease.

845
00:56:04,255 --> 00:56:05,576
[SPEAKER_10]: It kind of does, actually.

846
00:56:05,616 --> 00:56:05,797
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

847
00:56:06,758 --> 00:56:09,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, that's about it we have for the Nintendo press conference.

848
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:16,382
[SPEAKER_10]: But in our pre-OLR twit that we asked on the Twitter, it's twitter.com slash OLR, we asked this question to you guys.

849
00:56:16,782 --> 00:56:21,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Did Nintendo's press conference this week make up for their lackluster E3 showing?

850
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:22,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Why or why not?

851
00:56:22,244 --> 00:56:23,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what do you think?

852
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:24,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we get to the Twitter answers.

853
00:56:24,985 --> 00:56:30,688
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that they made up for it a little bit, but there's still no mention of Disaster Day of Crisis, which I heard that they're...

854
00:56:31,693 --> 00:56:34,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Waiting to see how it does in Europe before they release it over here.

855
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:35,475
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

856
00:56:36,155 --> 00:56:37,376
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's kind of retarded.

857
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously, you're just waiting to see how it does in Europe?

858
00:56:41,277 --> 00:56:42,978
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to piss people off.

859
00:56:44,959 --> 00:56:47,320
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, I don't know.

860
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,903
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of... It was a little bit more exciting than what they showed at E3, but at the same time, I look at what they're putting out.

861
00:56:54,763 --> 00:56:56,224
[SPEAKER_11]: A remake of Punch-Out!

862
00:56:57,325 --> 00:56:58,485
[SPEAKER_11]: A remake of Pikmin!

863
00:57:00,406 --> 00:57:00,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh...

864
00:57:02,702 --> 00:57:08,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, a sequel to a game that we didn't get over here, which looks alright, but it's just okay.

865
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,323
[SPEAKER_11]: It's nothing like, woo, awesome.

866
00:57:10,783 --> 00:57:12,644
[SPEAKER_11]: So in other words, you wanted more original IPs?

867
00:57:13,124 --> 00:57:18,085
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted something a little bit, you know, they could have just shown Disaster Day of Crisis, because that actually looked pretty cool.

868
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:18,805
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Conduit?

869
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:19,945
[SPEAKER_11]: They did show Conduit.

870
00:57:20,085 --> 00:57:20,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's a new thing.

871
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:24,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they showed Conduit, which, who knows when the hell that's going to be published.

872
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:31,307
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, there was something I heard about, like, Wii Motion Plus being added to it, and so that means it's not coming out until after March.

873
00:57:32,788 --> 00:57:33,748
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what do you think?

874
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:35,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they redeem themselves from E3?

875
00:57:56,824 --> 00:58:00,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I really, it's a really wait and see thing for me.

876
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:02,826
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a wait and see thing for me.

877
00:58:03,486 --> 00:58:09,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because I've gotten excited about stuff and then found out it to be a big load of crap.

878
00:58:10,249 --> 00:58:12,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like to be excited about loads of crap.

879
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I would rather think, oh that looks like crap and be pleasantly surprised.

880
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,856
[SPEAKER_10]: The conference was okay for me.

881
00:58:20,016 --> 00:58:21,557
[SPEAKER_10]: There wasn't anything that made me squee.

882
00:58:21,837 --> 00:58:22,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's the thing.

883
00:58:22,857 --> 00:58:30,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It was missing that certain Nintendo fanboy squee, giggle, I love you Nintendo, have my babies.

884
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:31,382
[SPEAKER_10]: That was kind of missing.

885
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:34,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then I'm glad you got something out of it.

886
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,264
[SPEAKER_10]: But for me, there wasn't really any of that.

887
00:58:36,284 --> 00:58:38,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

888
00:58:38,406 --> 00:58:42,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Punch-Out didn't look that... I mean, it just looked updated, like, graphics-wise.

889
00:58:42,868 --> 00:58:44,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's something that could have been released on WiiWare.

890
00:58:46,817 --> 00:58:47,900
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't look that different.

891
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, ooh, look, now it's cel-shaded.

892
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:51,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Awesome.

893
00:58:52,097 --> 00:58:52,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it any different?

894
00:58:53,178 --> 00:58:56,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's see what your Twitter users thought.

895
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,441
[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 says, Sin and Punishment 2.

896
00:58:58,981 --> 00:59:02,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad I was in Computer Lab when I read that, so I had to contain my fangasmic screens.

897
00:59:03,664 --> 00:59:04,825
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S says, Nope.

898
00:59:04,925 --> 00:59:08,787
[SPEAKER_10]: As much as I like the DSi and the new games, still wasn't much to bring to the table.

899
00:59:08,887 --> 00:59:09,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice try, Ninty.

900
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:10,488
[SPEAKER_10]: See you next year.

901
00:59:11,068 --> 00:59:17,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft says, At first I thought it was going to be the same lackluster conference, for the exception of the DSi, but then Nintendo went on and it was better.

902
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:24,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Crows said, yeah, at least this one wasn't about cowbells, Animal Crossing, Wii Sport, puppies, Wii Music, or crazy drummers.

903
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:25,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want the new DS.

904
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:30,007
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says, well, I wasn't crazy about the idea of buying another DS revision.

905
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:32,730
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the new Punch-Out sounds kick-ass even without Tyson.

906
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:36,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what's bugging me about Nintendo.

907
00:59:36,513 --> 00:59:38,455
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not trying to innovate at all.

908
00:59:38,895 --> 00:59:39,296
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not.

909
00:59:39,396 --> 00:59:43,119
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just putting out what they can get by as something new.

910
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:43,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold up, though.

911
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't the Wii console itself innovation?

912
00:59:46,943 --> 00:59:49,625
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine, but they did that, what, a couple years ago?

913
00:59:49,865 --> 00:59:51,106
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it's time for something new.

914
00:59:51,246 --> 00:59:52,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Time to keep up with the innovations.

915
00:59:52,988 --> 00:59:54,970
[SPEAKER_10]: No, don't encourage them to put out new peripherals.

916
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,971
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

917
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Old, made slightly new again.

918
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:22,054
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't get it.

919
01:00:22,194 --> 01:00:28,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're just watching what other people are doing, what's succeeding, and trying to emulate that, but they don't understand why it's working.

920
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:30,286
[SPEAKER_10]: More responses from the Twitter.

921
01:00:30,446 --> 01:00:34,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Did the Nintendo press conference this week make up for the lackluster showing at E3?

922
01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:38,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris says, almost everything at the conference was rumored for a while, so it was pretty meh itself.

923
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:41,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Picaruno says, just flat out, hell no.

924
01:00:42,293 --> 01:00:44,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Jacksonman says, yes, to an extent it did.

925
01:00:44,254 --> 01:00:45,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Something new is better than nothing.

926
01:00:46,656 --> 01:00:49,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Joshua Rover says, Ro-ever?

927
01:00:50,078 --> 01:00:50,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Ro-ever.

928
01:00:50,658 --> 01:00:51,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Joshua Ro-ever.

929
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:52,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to spell it out.

930
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:57,280
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, the recent press conference Nintendo held has completely redeemed them to me.

931
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,661
[SPEAKER_10]: They really do care about the hardcore that built them.

932
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:02,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Deekman says, nope, still pretty lackluster.

933
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:06,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Ionotropic says, hell no, they're still not catering to the core gamer.

934
01:01:06,822 --> 01:01:08,683
[SPEAKER_10]: That's almost two completely conflicting answers there.

935
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:10,823
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really interesting between that and what Joshua said.

936
01:01:11,383 --> 01:01:15,124
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Gerardimo says, no, their excuse for being lackluster will never be forgiven.

937
01:01:15,444 --> 01:01:18,525
[SPEAKER_10]: They could have done all this at E3 and a separate event for Wii Music.

938
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:19,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

939
01:01:19,966 --> 01:01:21,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Very differing responses, too.

940
01:01:21,307 --> 01:01:23,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are almost like polar opposites, some of those.

941
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:27,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So Nintendo definitely knows how to get people talking, if nothing else.

942
01:01:28,783 --> 01:01:29,924

01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,743

[SPEAKER_10]: That is all coming out on the Xbox 360.

967
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:20,754
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.

968
01:05:20,814 --> 01:05:21,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is.

969
01:05:22,095 --> 01:05:24,536
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really it for those two systems this week.

970
01:05:24,576 --> 01:05:26,297
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to wait until next week for some of the bigger stuff.

971
01:05:27,378 --> 01:05:31,540
[SPEAKER_10]: However, let's take a look and see what's coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

974
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:40,166

01:05:41,507 --> 01:05:42,827

977
01:05:53,872 --> 01:05:57,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's based off the TV series, though, just so you know.

978
01:05:58,257 --> 01:06:02,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the PlayStation 2 version of Star Wars The Force Unleashed and a game called Will-O-Wisp.

979
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:04,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Easter no Kiseki comes out as well.

980
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:08,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Checking out the handheld systems to see what's coming out on there.

981
01:06:08,885 --> 01:06:11,166
[SPEAKER_10]: On the Nintendo DS, Snoopy DS.

982
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:13,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Squeenix is putting out a Snoopy DS game.

983
01:06:14,247 --> 01:06:19,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Snoopy to Chugen Taichi Niiku comes out.

984
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,070
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, that is Snoopy as in Peanut Snoopy.

985
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:24,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Because those characters are very popular over there still.

986
01:06:25,132 --> 01:06:27,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Nihongo de Asobo Kawaii

987
01:06:28,874 --> 01:06:53,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Konyu DS 2 comes out as well and Tetsudo Musume DS Terminal Memory comes out in both a regular and limited edition pack on the Nintendo DS and it looks like some game that centers around like stewards and stewardesses on airlines I don't know if it's some type of like drama turned game but there you go um

988
01:06:55,325 --> 01:07:08,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Also coming out on the Sony PSP, Mahjong Portable Jansu Battle is getting a price reduction.

989
01:07:09,012 --> 01:07:09,852
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really about it.

990
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:11,313
[SPEAKER_10]: There is one other game coming out.

991
01:07:11,393 --> 01:07:12,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks to be a big one.

992
01:07:13,414 --> 01:07:14,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Macross Ace Frontier.

993
01:07:15,515 --> 01:07:16,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet!

994
01:07:16,556 --> 01:07:17,656
[SPEAKER_10]: From Bandai Namco.

995
01:07:17,897 --> 01:07:18,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And one more.

996
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:19,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

997
01:07:20,038 --> 01:07:20,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Ace Frontier?

998
01:07:20,798 --> 01:07:22,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the series was Macross Frontier.

999
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:24,568
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they're calling it, Macross Ace Frontier.

1000
01:07:25,169 --> 01:07:29,412
[SPEAKER_10]: And one other game that looks, I think it's like an Othello, oh no, it's Go.

1001
01:07:29,573 --> 01:07:32,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a version of Go on your PSP.

1002
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:39,421
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Umewaza Ikari no Yahashi Ego, and I think that must be like a championship player that's on the cover.

1003
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:41,743
[SPEAKER_10]: So, she's pretty.

1004
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:44,786
[SPEAKER_10]: They're using her pretty face to sell just Go.

1005
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:47,768
[SPEAKER_10]: There you have it, your Japanese release dates.

1006
01:07:49,249 --> 01:07:51,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's move back into some gaming news, DarkSakura.

1007
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:52,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we gotta?

1008
01:07:52,596 --> 01:07:53,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we gotta.

1009
01:07:53,077 --> 01:07:56,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this makes me very happy, and I'm going to download it depending on how it plays.

1010
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,080
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're bringing Pole Position to the iPhone.

1011
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,200
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me very happy.

1012
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all cutesy 3D-y.

1013
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,042
[SPEAKER_04]: They look like little toy cars.

1014
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:09,003
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's...

1015
01:08:10,524 --> 01:08:11,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1016
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:38,774
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do play with moving the iPhone around, I would prefer that it be a little bit more natural and intuitive and not have to be held at some funky-ass bizarre angle.

1017
01:08:39,374 --> 01:08:40,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to give it a try.

1018
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:48,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's $9.99, but I think that it might be worthwhile after a check arrives at my house.

1019
01:08:50,218 --> 01:08:50,558
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1020
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:53,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's pole position.

1021
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:54,220
[SPEAKER_10]: It's old school.

1022
01:08:57,952 --> 01:09:00,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, you don't really get the cool crashes in Pole Position.

1023
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:05,675
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just a little explosion graphic, but at least it was an explosion.

1024
01:09:06,735 --> 01:09:09,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the Pole Position cabinets from back in the day.

1025
01:09:09,657 --> 01:09:10,577
[SPEAKER_10]: That was good times.

1026
01:09:11,157 --> 01:09:12,138
[SPEAKER_10]: That was 80s gaming.

1027
01:09:12,198 --> 01:09:13,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I love to sit down once.

1028
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:15,879
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that we actually built our first main cabinet out of a Pole Position.

1029
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:16,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you still got it, right?

1030
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere, I think.

1031
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now we've got our Reaper Pac-Man thing that we were going to put it in.

1032
01:09:23,022 --> 01:09:23,142
Cool.

1033
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:23,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1034
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:32,144
[SPEAKER_11]: D3 is putting out a new game called Eat Lead.

1035
01:09:34,947 --> 01:09:37,589
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of interesting the way they promoted this thing.

1036
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:39,951
[SPEAKER_11]: It stars a supposedly...

1037
01:09:40,936 --> 01:09:46,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Old School Action Game Superhero Matt Hazard Weapons of Matt Destruction Altered Beast

1038
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:18,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt Hazard 3D, Fistful of Hazard, Hazmat Carts, and You Only Live 1370 Times.

1039
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:23,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Along with all this stuff, the game itself is actually going to be a 3D shooter.

1040
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:28,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Some interesting stuff to go along with that is

1041
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:32,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1042
01:10:49,223 --> 01:10:56,309
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's got a script written by, I guess, this guy, David Ellis, who did, I guess, the Doctor Who serial, The Faceless Ones.

1043
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:01,754
[SPEAKER_11]: And the game itself is going to be... It kind of reminds me a little bit of Coated Arms, I guess.

1044
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:08,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the shooter game itself will take place across all sorts of different video game cliches.

1045
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,223
[SPEAKER_11]: But you can actually hack into the different characters and do different things to them.

1046
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,323
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of neat.

1047
01:11:14,324 --> 01:11:14,444
[SPEAKER_11]: And...

1048
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:17,429
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1049
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:47,051
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1050
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:48,852
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds like a serious movie.

1051
01:11:48,872 --> 01:11:50,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of those movies like Meet the Spartans, right?

1052
01:11:50,772 --> 01:11:56,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it makes fun of all these great movies that came out in the past year, but it's just the dumbest thing you'll ever see.

1053
01:11:56,594 --> 01:11:59,395
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of games that have done it right.

1054
01:11:59,595 --> 01:12:05,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I think TimeSplitters did the whole making fun of shooters games kind of right.

1055
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:08,378
[SPEAKER_11]: They actually just went really bizarre with that game, but it was fun.

1056
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:09,679
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the best part about it.

1057
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:17,333
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope they come out with a new one because they released some teaser concept art for it this week as well.

1058
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:29,178
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyways, and it says he's making his next-gen comeback against all of his old enemies in a hilarious parody of the last 25 years of gaming.

1059
01:12:30,758 --> 01:12:31,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1060
01:12:31,058 --> 01:12:37,441
[SPEAKER_11]: It reminds me of something like a character that could have been one of the shareware characters from like Apogee or Epic Games.

1061
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:39,851
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be cool.

1062
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:40,911
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we'll see.

1063
01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:43,073
[SPEAKER_11]: It comes out in, I think, February.

1064
01:12:43,633 --> 01:12:43,974
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1065
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:45,155
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1066
01:12:46,135 --> 01:12:49,978
[SPEAKER_10]: One other thing that's coming out relatively soon, a Spore expansion.

1067
01:12:50,459 --> 01:12:52,300
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, because Spore wasn't enough.

1068
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Spore expansion, November 18th.

1069
01:12:54,622 --> 01:12:56,683
[SPEAKER_10]: The Cute and Creepy Parts Pack.

1070
01:12:57,324 --> 01:12:57,704
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only $20.

1071
01:12:57,764 --> 01:13:02,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, there isn't much out there about what this is.

1072
01:13:02,648 --> 01:13:06,090
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, if it's the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack, do you think it might be?

1073
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:06,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I don't know.

1074
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:08,994
[SPEAKER_10]: New parts for your creatures that you make?

1075
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:15,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was leaked on... Apparently, Amazon had the store pages up first, but now it's also being spotted on GameStop.

1076
01:13:15,322 --> 01:13:18,105
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it is coming on November 18th.

1077
01:13:18,405 --> 01:13:20,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, my question is digital downloads.

1078
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:22,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Surely, this has to be something they're going to offer us that as well.

1079
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:23,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, why not, right?

1080
01:13:24,894 --> 01:13:25,755
[SPEAKER_10]: You're willing to give them money.

1081
01:13:27,747 --> 01:13:32,333
[SPEAKER_10]: No word as to how many parts we're talking about yet, but for $20, there better be quite a few.

1082
01:13:32,573 --> 01:13:34,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the new expansion come with new DRM?

1083
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:36,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Because that'd be awesome.

1084
01:13:36,058 --> 01:13:39,042
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd pay the $20 if it'll uninstall Securom.

1085
01:13:39,442 --> 01:13:39,963
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

1086
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:41,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I shouldn't have to pay anything to get rid of that.

1087
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,087
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what I'm saying.

1088
01:13:43,968 --> 01:14:01,700
[SPEAKER_10]: so there you go spore expansion for those of you spore addicts and I think I said this during Bobby's show I don't know if I said this earlier in this show but some of the monsters in Silent Hill Homecoming kind of look like they were made in spore they're kind of creepy looking like arms off people's backs and stuff scary very scary are there any penis monsters?

1089
01:14:02,202 --> 01:14:03,303
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no penis monsters.

1090
01:14:05,645 --> 01:14:06,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Fail!

1091
01:14:06,206 --> 01:14:08,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you want to ruin Silent Hill with penis monsters?

1092
01:14:08,968 --> 01:14:11,610
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, put penis monsters in a game that's already... Well, we've got Pyramid Heads.

1093
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good enough.

1094
01:14:12,691 --> 01:14:13,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1095
01:14:13,572 --> 01:14:14,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he just as prolific?

1096
01:14:15,013 --> 01:14:16,555
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I hear, but I haven't gotten to him yet.

1097
01:14:16,575 --> 01:14:17,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played enough.

1098
01:14:17,195 --> 01:14:17,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1099
01:14:17,736 --> 01:14:18,096
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see.

1100
01:14:18,877 --> 01:14:22,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, VXJasonXV in chat says, No one bought Spore except for you.

1101
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:22,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably true.

1102
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:23,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby did.

1103
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:25,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably the only one that actually bought it.

1104
01:14:25,182 --> 01:14:25,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1105
01:14:25,622 --> 01:14:25,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Bobby did.

1106
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:28,799
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?

1107
01:14:55,047 --> 01:15:00,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first of all, I'd like to play the intro to this in just a second, which is why I late the one I did.

1108
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:00,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1109
01:15:00,889 --> 01:15:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a second before you start it.

1110
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:07,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But the game is called Nekatsu Koko Dodgeball Boo, which is basically Super Dodgeball over here.

1111
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,311
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the Kunio games.

1112
01:15:11,151 --> 01:15:11,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

1113
01:15:11,631 --> 01:15:13,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall we have a little bit of intro?

1114
01:15:13,712 --> 01:15:14,392
[SPEAKER_10]: We shall.

1115
01:15:14,492 --> 01:15:14,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

1116
01:15:14,872 --> 01:15:16,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we want the whole Neo Geo splash screen and everything?

1117
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:20,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1118
01:15:20,713 --> 01:15:22,674
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what a Neo Geo sounds like when you press the on button.

1119
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:23,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1120
01:15:32,062 --> 01:15:34,664
[SPEAKER_09]: SUPER DODGE BALL

1121
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:09,160
[SPEAKER_04]: As you eliminate characters, basically a little angel takes them to the top of the screen and they go away.

1122
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,162
[SPEAKER_04]: But your life bar is basically how many teammates you have left.

1123
01:16:14,882 --> 01:16:17,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So you defeat the other team by knocking out the teammates.

1124
01:16:17,383 --> 01:16:20,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is, you know, dodgeball.

1125
01:16:21,304 --> 01:16:24,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to keep knocking them down with the ball until they're just done.

1126
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:30,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've also got a special throw called your power shot that your team captain can use.

1127
01:16:32,561 --> 01:16:35,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to clarify some things in chat, because I love this game.

1128
01:16:35,965 --> 01:16:37,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very excited when DarkSakura picked it.

1129
01:16:38,728 --> 01:16:39,589
[SPEAKER_10]: I really do love this game.

1130
01:16:40,149 --> 01:16:43,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma asked in chat, isn't this the same version as on NES, same characters?

1131
01:16:44,374 --> 01:16:51,702
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not, because these are like custom characters, whereas the NES had the very general, you know, like, there are definitely related games.

1132
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:52,963
[SPEAKER_10]: They play very similarly.

1133
01:16:53,703 --> 01:16:55,544
[SPEAKER_04]: They're both in the Kunio series.

1134
01:16:56,065 --> 01:17:06,991
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that I linked here, though, is actually the... I believe the captain is the main character from what we got as River City Ransom.

1135
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:08,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Naketsu...

1136
01:17:11,434 --> 01:17:14,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Blooded High School Story or whatever.

1137
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:21,680
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I like the special edition because honestly it has better music.

1138
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:28,325
[SPEAKER_04]: But in this one though, you start off by going around the world and you pick your team from different places.

1139
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:33,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But you start off with a game between Dallas and Chicago to show who's going to represent the United States.

1140
01:17:34,369 --> 01:17:36,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you go around to England, Iceland...

1141
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:42,914
[SPEAKER_04]: China, Africa, although in later versions it was changed to Kenya, so you could run as fast as Kenyans.

1142
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:43,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And Japan!

1143
01:17:46,936 --> 01:17:53,159
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you beat Japan, you actually get your World Cup given to you by a ninja.

1144
01:17:54,580 --> 01:18:09,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, yeah, what I was basically saying is that the game, um, was part of the, uh, the Kunio series, um, the first one being, um, Neketsu Koha Kunia-kun, which was what we got as, uh, Renegade over here.

1145
01:18:09,813 --> 01:18:13,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that the other one in the series was, um, River City.

1146
01:18:15,017 --> 01:18:21,082
[SPEAKER_04]: But the way that the game starts is basically Kunio gets hit in the head with a dodgeball and his, uh, teammates go and beat him up.

1147
01:18:21,883 --> 01:18:23,324
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1148
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:31,896
[SPEAKER_04]: And the teams of Dallas and Chicago were actually the teams of Neketsu High School and Hanazono High School in the Japanese version.

1149
01:18:32,556 --> 01:18:34,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So they, of course, modified it.

1150
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:35,857
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an NES version.

1151
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:42,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually was published by Technos, which was the one that released the arcade version.

1152
01:18:42,559 --> 01:18:43,819
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's not even the same.

1153
01:18:43,979 --> 01:18:44,419
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not.

1154
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, from what I remember.

1155
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:46,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, sorry.

1156
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very passionate about my dodgeball games.

1157
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:51,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it actually had six members.

1158
01:18:51,642 --> 01:18:53,602
[SPEAKER_04]: You had the team captain and five others.

1159
01:18:54,022 --> 01:18:57,363
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were all the same size instead of having your captain be, like, uber huge.

1160
01:18:58,163 --> 01:19:00,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, you could only have three players inside the court.

1161
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:06,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could arrange your positions, though, um, at the beginning of each match.

1162
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:09,346
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could, you know, make use of your different techniques.

1163
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:10,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1164
01:19:11,326 --> 01:19:17,210
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually adjust your energy, throwing power, throwing technique, and ball break, which is the curve.

1165
01:19:17,410 --> 01:19:21,212
[SPEAKER_04]: You had agility, catching technique, and damage capacity.

1166
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:22,833
[SPEAKER_04]: There are also two extra teams.

1167
01:19:22,853 --> 01:19:24,234
[SPEAKER_04]: There was India and USSR.

1168
01:19:28,116 --> 01:19:35,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it had a lot of the same stuff, but had some pretty significant changes, I guess, to make it work on the NES.

1169
01:19:35,121 --> 01:19:36,923
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to deal with a lot of that.

1170
01:19:36,983 --> 01:19:38,263
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the version of Strider?

1171
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:41,686
[SPEAKER_04]: It was based off of comic books, though.

1172
01:19:41,746 --> 01:19:44,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and Strider was also a totally different game.

1173
01:19:44,888 --> 01:19:46,850
[SPEAKER_04]: The story was based off of comics.

1174
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,891
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even the same type of game.

1175
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:52,634
[SPEAKER_10]: The Sega Strider was just a straight-up arcade action game, whereas...

1176
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:57,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, there was that more open world feel to the NES one.

1177
01:19:58,057 --> 01:20:01,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we've already done Strider.

1178
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:03,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry.

1179
01:20:03,641 --> 01:20:07,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say this, because VXJsNextV in chat brings up a related game.

1180
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:11,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Was anyone else epic disappointed by Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball?

1181
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:13,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I played the demo and I thought it was awful.

1182
01:20:14,088 --> 01:20:14,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Awful, awful, awful.

1183
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:16,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And I quit in about five minutes.

1184
01:20:16,629 --> 01:20:21,833
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe I shouldn't judge something completely based on five minutes of gameplay, but honestly, with demos, that's about how long you have to sell me.

1185
01:20:22,373 --> 01:20:24,114
[SPEAKER_10]: and it made me miss this game.

1186
01:20:43,162 --> 01:20:44,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh, that caught my breath for a second.

1187
01:20:44,663 --> 01:20:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: But there were other ones.

1188
01:20:45,523 --> 01:20:49,785
[SPEAKER_04]: On X6800, it was released by SPS, which was a direct arcade port.

1189
01:20:50,085 --> 01:21:06,531
[SPEAKER_04]: PC Engine had Neketsu Koko Dojibou Bupishi Bangaihen, which translates to Neketsu High School Dojibou Club Bonus PC Edition, that was released by Maxsoft Soft in 1990, which I've played this version a ton.

1190
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:07,372
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty cool.

1191
01:21:09,893 --> 01:21:13,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually are having to fight off aliens disguised as dodgeball fighters.

1192
01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:19,315
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Windows version of the Famicom port that was done by BRS Corp in 2003.

1193
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:27,497
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2 had an arcade port that was put out by Hamster Corp as part of the Oretachi Gessenzoku lineup.

1194
01:21:28,538 --> 01:21:32,879
[SPEAKER_04]: The Famicom version came out on Game Boy as part of the Kunio Kuniketsu Collection 1.

1195
01:21:33,999 --> 01:21:37,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Naketsu Koko, Dodgeball Buu, Kyoteki, Dodgeball Soldier no Maki

1196
01:21:50,853 --> 01:21:57,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Fearsome Rival, Tale of the Dodge Soldier, Kunio-kun no Dodgeball Daioh Zenin Shugo

1197
01:22:10,642 --> 01:22:11,963
[SPEAKER_04]: France, Brazil, and Germany.

1198
01:22:12,463 --> 01:22:23,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the one that we're having a video of here, which is the Kunio no Neketsu Dojibouro Densetsu, which is Kunio's Neketsu Dojibouro Legends, the Neo Geo release.

1199
01:22:23,987 --> 01:22:27,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Technos did release this one, so that was pretty cool.

1200
01:22:28,089 --> 01:22:41,914
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also have special moves, not just for your captain, but you have several main characters, and you have to do Street Fighter 2-like commands to get them to go off, like you saw the girls do their little attacks in there.

1201
01:22:42,394 --> 01:22:52,418
[SPEAKER_04]: But you've got seven playable characters, and you also have them being the main characters from the Ketsu Kouha Kunioku, like in Renegade over here.

1202
01:22:53,358 --> 01:22:59,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, also Super Dodgeball Advance, we, um, it wasn't actually a Kunio game.

1203
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:06,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but it was done with a lot of the same character style and gameplay.

1204
01:23:06,163 --> 01:23:08,064
[SPEAKER_04]: It was put out by Million, haven't you?

1205
01:23:08,724 --> 01:23:14,686
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also, the Million did do an official DS sequel called Chounaketsu Koko Kunio-kun Dodgeball Boo.

1206
01:23:15,646 --> 01:23:16,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I just like saying it.

1207
01:23:16,707 --> 01:23:16,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1208
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:23,471
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's also Super Dodgeball Brawlers that's supposed to be by Axis.

1209
01:23:23,551 --> 01:23:25,532
[SPEAKER_04]: It was supposed to come out.

1210
01:23:26,412 --> 01:23:28,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Has it already come out?

1211
01:23:29,274 --> 01:23:29,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1212
01:23:29,734 --> 01:23:30,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played that one yet.

1213
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:32,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I played the Game Boy Advance one, but not that one.

1214
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:35,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if you can go in there and order food at a deli.

1215
01:23:35,799 --> 01:23:37,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if it has booty, like in the spa.

1216
01:23:37,739 --> 01:23:39,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember River City Ransom?

1217
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:39,600
[SPEAKER_04]: 8-bit ass?

1218
01:23:56,716 --> 01:24:02,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still going to have to play the Japanese version of River City Ransom for you.

1219
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:08,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because it's so cool, they go into a little kusatsu and order food and they're all like doing little anime smiley things.

1220
01:24:09,484 --> 01:24:11,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I always liked that the smiles were free.

1221
01:24:11,765 --> 01:24:12,986
[SPEAKER_10]: I always liked that the smiles were free.

1222
01:24:13,326 --> 01:24:14,107
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

1223
01:24:14,547 --> 01:24:15,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anything else on Super Dodgeball?

1224
01:24:15,908 --> 01:24:16,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, no.

1225
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there you have it.

1226
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:22,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Your classic game of the week, and a real classic, and yeah...

1227
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:24,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't bother with pirate images.

1228
01:24:24,592 --> 01:24:27,154
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because I picked something I had already done before and forgot about it.

1229
01:24:27,454 --> 01:24:27,874
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

1230
01:24:27,934 --> 01:24:28,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It's bound to happen.

1231
01:24:28,595 --> 01:24:29,596
[SPEAKER_10]: How many weeks have we been doing this now?

1232
01:24:29,616 --> 01:24:30,156
[SPEAKER_10]: At least 50.

1233
01:24:31,878 --> 01:24:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We started it on episode 250.

1234
01:24:33,439 --> 01:24:34,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we running out of classic games?

1235
01:24:35,141 --> 01:24:35,421
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

1236
01:24:36,181 --> 01:24:36,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Never!

1237
01:24:37,262 --> 01:24:39,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, as I can think of a few we haven't done.

1238
01:24:39,624 --> 01:24:40,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what?

1239
01:24:40,986 --> 01:24:43,187
[SPEAKER_10]: You have never named one single solitary Commodore 64 game.

1240
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:46,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what system Jamie didn't play.

1241
01:24:47,244 --> 01:24:52,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're ever out during a week, I will bring a Commodore 64 game in the picture.

1242
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:53,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I already know which one I'm going to do, too.

1243
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:54,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I already know.

1244
01:24:54,931 --> 01:24:55,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1245
01:24:55,311 --> 01:24:58,194
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's one of those games people are going to go, WTF is he picking that game?

1246
01:24:58,214 --> 01:25:01,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you better watch out or I'll start busting out the ColecoVision, yo.

1247
01:25:01,116 --> 01:25:01,437
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1248
01:25:01,517 --> 01:25:01,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait.

1249
01:25:02,217 --> 01:25:03,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Mousetrap, Venture.

1250
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:05,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, plenty more to come.

1251
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,321
[SPEAKER_10]: She's got enough to carry us through episode 400.

1252
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:08,342
[SPEAKER_10]: GORF.

1253
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:10,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I freaking love GORF.

1254
01:25:10,403 --> 01:25:11,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost did GORF.

1255
01:25:12,184 --> 01:25:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, GORF is soon.

1256
01:25:13,725 --> 01:25:14,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe next week.

1257
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:16,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Little teaser for next week.

1258
01:25:16,186 --> 01:25:16,486
[SPEAKER_10]: GORF.

1259
01:25:16,966 --> 01:25:17,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyhow.

1260
01:25:18,415 --> 01:25:35,142
[SPEAKER_10]: that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio but hey stay tuned there's plenty more to come after a quick break and hey during the break tonight since there's not a lot of free commercials for the free break anymore because no one's sending me stuff but that's okay we got something even better giving stuff away if you were paying attention to last week's show

1261
01:25:35,762 --> 01:25:37,123
[SPEAKER_10]: We're drawing the names right after this.

1262
01:25:37,203 --> 01:25:44,307
[SPEAKER_10]: If you weren't paying attention to last week's show, you got about five minutes to find it because we're giving away some free Xbox 360 games right after the ES.

1263
01:25:44,367 --> 01:25:48,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I said games, and I'll explain more a little bit about that right after the break.

1264
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:52,112
[SPEAKER_10]: But for you podcast listeners, you have to wait like five seconds for that little transition noise.

1265
01:25:52,432 --> 01:25:53,033
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you need.

1266
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:58,576
[SPEAKER_10]: But live listeners, you have to sit and listen to some music while we take a break, rest our voices, potty, drinks, all that stuff.

1267
01:25:59,457 --> 01:26:00,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not like drink from the potty.

1268
01:26:00,817 --> 01:26:02,398
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be nasty, but forget it.

1269
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:06,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll be right back with more Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1270
01:26:13,166 --> 01:26:22,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, if you were listening last week at this part of the show where we usually do the free break, you know that we are doing a contest and we are giving away copies of Feeding Frenzy 2.

[SPEAKER_10]: There's just tons and tons of ways.

1294
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:03,222
[SPEAKER_10]: We will.

1295
01:28:03,942 --> 01:28:04,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1296
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:06,448
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to do the mailbag, sorry, like it or not.

1297
01:28:07,589 --> 01:28:10,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, but first we're going to do some more gaming news, right Loki?

1298
01:28:10,491 --> 01:28:11,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's correct.

1299
01:28:11,491 --> 01:28:18,436
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, little known fact, there is a Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2 coming out.

1300
01:28:19,316 --> 01:28:23,719
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is not to be confused with another expansion disc we'll be talking about in a little bit.

1301
01:28:24,279 --> 01:28:32,885
[SPEAKER_11]: But Volume 2 of course contains some tracks that were available on the download sites, both PlayStation Network and...

1302
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:35,909
[SPEAKER_11]: and on Xbox Live Marketplace.

1303
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:48,188
[SPEAKER_11]: The track list contains 20 different songs and includes Avenged Sevenfold, Afterlife, Blondie with Call Me, Weezer, El Scorcho, Devo, Girl You Want,

1304
01:28:49,666 --> 01:29:18,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Maximo Park, Girls Who Play Guitars, Disturbed, Indestructible, Angels and Airwaves, It Hurts, The Cars, Just What I Needed, The Police, Message in a Bottle, Pixies, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Duran Duran with Rio, Motley Crue, Saints of LA, which I want to say that was a free track, so that's not really fair, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Simple Man, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow, Heyo, and...

1305
01:29:20,196 --> 01:29:21,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually like that song.

1306
01:29:21,237 --> 01:29:27,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Fall Out Boy, This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race.

1307
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:29,503
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a goddamn arms race, actually.

1308
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:30,463
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's censored.

1309
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:31,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1310
01:29:31,924 --> 01:29:36,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Papa Roach, Time Is Running Out, Garbage, Why Do You Love Me,

1311
01:29:37,148 --> 01:29:37,888
[SPEAKER_11]: JizzPriest, SmashingPumpkins0

1312
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:07,548
[SPEAKER_11]: and this will also have, I think, achievements as well because you can play this game standalone as well.

1313
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:10,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that sucks because I have 10 of those songs already.

1314
01:30:10,912 --> 01:30:12,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the game going to reimburse me for the 10 I already bought?

1315
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:13,455
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1316
01:30:14,015 --> 01:30:14,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Lame.

1317
01:30:14,936 --> 01:30:17,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you also have access to Xbox Live Marketplace.

1318
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:20,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I want achievements because I want achievements.

1319
01:30:22,324 --> 01:30:26,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, you know, I don't really, but I'm being devil's advocate here.

1320
01:30:26,266 --> 01:30:31,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, why is that fair that somebody who waited to buy it gets to get a thousand more gamerscore?

1321
01:30:32,129 --> 01:30:39,213
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really meant, I think, for the people that don't have live, and this is the only way that they can buy expansion packs.

1322
01:30:40,013 --> 01:31:03,182
[SPEAKER_11]: but it says yeah included code allows these songs to be downloaded and played with Rock Band or Rock Band 2 via the PlayStation Network of course this is the PlayStation 3 version I'm looking at the back of so that's interesting though they can be downloaded for Rock Band 1 as well so hmm interesting but yeah this game you do not it does not require you to have the first game or the second game

1323
01:31:05,342 --> 01:31:05,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1324
01:31:06,102 --> 01:31:06,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, though.

1325
01:31:06,662 --> 01:31:09,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I already kind of own pretty much the whole game, so there you have it.

1326
01:31:09,803 --> 01:31:12,804
[SPEAKER_11]: But for those who don't, and you know, to be honest, probably just buy them online.

1327
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:13,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably a little cheaper anyways.

1328
01:31:15,084 --> 01:31:15,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, no.

1329
01:31:15,865 --> 01:31:24,487
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's $2 a song, that'd be about $40, and this is going to retail for $29.99, so you save a little bit of money.

1330
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:25,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious.

1331
01:31:25,107 --> 01:31:27,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anyone in our chat room right now that would be interested in buying this?

1332
01:31:28,568 --> 01:31:29,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet not a one.

1333
01:31:30,899 --> 01:31:38,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because everybody in our chatroom is obviously online enough where they're online chatting with our show that they probably don't, you know, their console's online too, I imagine.

1334
01:31:39,622 --> 01:31:44,144
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's good for those that don't have it, or for those that are on the Wii where that's not really implemented yet, even though it's supposed to be.

1335
01:31:44,264 --> 01:31:46,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it will be, hopefully, with this one.

1336
01:31:46,405 --> 01:31:53,047
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe, you know, by the time the Wii version comes out, because I think this is not scheduled to come out until November.

1337
01:31:53,347 --> 01:31:55,228
[SPEAKER_11]: It's around the same time as the Wii version, so...

1338
01:31:56,828 --> 01:31:59,469
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, that's not the only expansion for Rock Band coming soon.

1339
01:31:59,489 --> 01:32:00,309
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the interesting thing.

1340
01:32:00,329 --> 01:32:03,750
[SPEAKER_10]: The other expansion that's coming is not something that you can already download.

1341
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:05,351
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a brand new track pack.

1342
01:32:05,411 --> 01:32:08,611
[SPEAKER_10]: It's ACDC Live is coming.

1343
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:09,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

1344
01:32:09,272 --> 01:32:10,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the weird thing, though.

1345
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:15,993
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a Walmart and Sam's Club exclusive because I believe there's a new ACDC album that is an exclusive.

1346
01:32:16,574 --> 01:32:17,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So go figure.

1347
01:32:18,354 --> 01:32:21,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those of you in foreign countries that are pouting about that, hey,

1348
01:32:21,915 --> 01:32:22,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Guess what?

1349
01:32:22,515 --> 01:32:25,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Also for Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in early December.

1350
01:32:25,696 --> 01:32:28,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So they didn't forget about you unless you're not in one of those countries.

1351
01:32:28,637 --> 01:32:29,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And they did forget about you.

1352
01:32:31,038 --> 01:32:36,980
[SPEAKER_10]: All the songs from the disc, you can use them in Rock Band and Rock Band 2 using an export authentication code.

1353
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:37,660
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing.

1354
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,661
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only use that once per disc.

1355
01:32:41,461 --> 01:32:44,622
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's the same with this track pack 2 as well.

1356
01:32:44,662 --> 01:32:46,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's only once per disc.

1357
01:32:47,469 --> 01:32:48,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, I mean, come on.

1358
01:32:48,549 --> 01:32:53,170
[SPEAKER_11]: They're smart enough to know, hey, they're just going to buy it and download it for five bucks to all their friends.

1359
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:55,351
[SPEAKER_11]: You can only do that with Rock Band 1.

1360
01:32:55,971 --> 01:32:59,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And, by the way, that $29 price point is only for the PlayStation 2 version.

1361
01:32:59,772 --> 01:33:05,013
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want the fancier ones for a 360, PS3, or Wii, $39.88 is the magic price.

1362
01:33:05,133 --> 01:33:05,653
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fucked up.

1363
01:33:05,673 --> 01:33:08,274
[SPEAKER_10]: November 2nd for... Here's the weird thing.

1364
01:33:08,314 --> 01:33:10,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you want it on Wii, though, you've got to wait.

1365
01:33:10,194 --> 01:33:11,635
[SPEAKER_10]: November 16th is the date for you.

1366
01:33:11,655 --> 01:33:14,915
[SPEAKER_10]: 360, PS3, and PS2, you get it on November 2nd.

1367
01:33:15,276 --> 01:33:16,756
[SPEAKER_10]: That's ACDC Live.

1368
01:33:17,336 --> 01:33:25,320
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently the game has its own set of achievements, which is very much in line with the same thing Loki was talking about.

1369
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Although, funny enough, I'm seeing a lot of news this week on the blogs about this.

1370
01:33:28,962 --> 01:33:30,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not seeing a damn thing about what you just told us.

1371
01:33:31,663 --> 01:33:33,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that because you told us a secret or what?

1372
01:33:34,265 --> 01:33:36,106
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't know why this isn't out there.

1373
01:33:36,146 --> 01:33:37,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's going to be available soon.

1374
01:33:37,967 --> 01:33:40,488
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just I guess maybe it's not as exciting as ACDC.

1375
01:33:40,908 --> 01:33:41,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess not.

1376
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:44,849
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was a lot of confusion, I know, with at least us selling this.

1377
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:47,691
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's like, is this the same damn thing as the Walmart one?

1378
01:33:48,231 --> 01:33:48,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1379
01:33:48,571 --> 01:33:50,091
[SPEAKER_11]: But no, it's actually something completely different.

1380
01:33:50,452 --> 01:33:50,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

1381
01:33:51,552 --> 01:34:02,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was going to say, probably the reason why it's not coming out on the 16th for the Wii is because Rock Band 2 is going to be the only one you'll be able to download that one for, I think.

1382
01:34:03,536 --> 01:34:04,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Or to do download play on.

1383
01:34:05,653 --> 01:34:05,993
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1384
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:07,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there you have it.

1385
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:07,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming soon.

1386
01:34:08,315 --> 01:34:11,897
[SPEAKER_10]: If you like ACDC, get ready to ring your hell's bells.

1387
01:34:11,937 --> 01:34:12,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

1388
01:34:13,798 --> 01:34:15,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, no, wait, no, that doesn't make any sense.

1389
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I was going to say, well, that doesn't make any sense.

1390
01:34:17,701 --> 01:34:23,525
[SPEAKER_11]: That's coming out on the 16th, and that means that you'll be able to save stuff to your SD member cards, but I forgot games already allow you to do that.

1391
01:34:23,565 --> 01:34:25,146
[SPEAKER_11]: It's channels that will be coming in 2009.

1392
01:34:25,546 --> 01:34:25,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, and it's 2009.

1393
01:34:26,026 --> 01:34:26,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1394
01:34:27,147 --> 01:34:27,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you have it.

1395
01:34:28,368 --> 01:34:29,108
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we'll move on.

1396
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:29,689
[SPEAKER_10]: More gaming news.

1397
01:34:31,212 --> 01:34:39,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for anyone who played the first episode for Penny Arcade and liked it, the second one is going to be cheaper.

1398
01:34:39,335 --> 01:34:51,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Head Games is actually listening to consumer feedback and is going to be releasing the game for 1,200 Microsoft points, which is...

1399
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:56,261
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 pounds 20 pence in pounds.

1400
01:34:58,082 --> 01:35:09,890
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be $14.95 US dollars on a PC, which is 7 pounds 50 in the UK.

1401
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:12,291
[SPEAKER_11]: $15 is still expensive for that game anyways.

1402
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous to charge $20 for it.

1403
01:35:15,653 --> 01:35:17,274
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if I want to buy the sequel.

1404
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:20,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm still interested.

1405
01:35:21,852 --> 01:35:24,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't finished the demo of the first one yet, to be honest.

1406
01:35:25,134 --> 01:35:27,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1407
01:35:27,355 --> 01:35:28,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I never finished the first one.

1408
01:35:28,676 --> 01:35:30,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I got bored with it too quick.

1409
01:35:30,818 --> 01:35:31,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Played other things.

1410
01:35:32,987 --> 01:35:33,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.

1411
01:35:54,272 --> 01:36:16,378

1412
01:36:16,538 --> 01:36:19,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah that's the fighting game for the Final Fantasy fighting game.

1413
01:36:19,419 --> 01:36:23,400
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see more on that Ratchet and Clank, Maru High Mission Ignition

1417
01:36:45,019 --> 01:36:45,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1418

[SPEAKER_10]: GS68 in the chatroom asks, Luminous Supernova?

1425
01:37:40,966 --> 01:37:42,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that was a game that came up earlier.

1426
01:37:42,406 --> 01:37:46,088
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the new PS3 Network Luminous game, right?

1427
01:37:46,188 --> 01:37:47,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes, that's the one.

[SPEAKER_10]: for a company to show games that are already out.

1430
01:38:11,606 --> 01:38:14,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, hell, when we went to E3 one year, they were still showing off Oblivion.

1431
01:38:14,468 --> 01:38:18,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, they were still releasing download content on a regular basis at Bethesda, but whatever.

1432
01:38:19,572 --> 01:38:21,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Konami is also showing off World Soccer Winning 11 2009.

[SPEAKER_10]: Your guess is as good as mine as to what that is.

1436
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:58,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Also showing friendly company to Konami, Hudson will be showing some titles on the floor.

1437
01:38:58,703 --> 01:39:01,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Some Wii titles that they'll be showing on the Tokyo Game Show floor.

1438
01:39:01,365 --> 01:39:06,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Fishing Master World Tour, Marble Saga Kororimpa.

1439
01:39:06,228 --> 01:39:09,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So now it's another, it looks like a new Kororimpa game coming exclusively to the Wii.

1440
01:39:10,271 --> 01:39:14,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It's new levels, four-person multiplayer gameplay apparently is going to be in this new game.

1441
01:39:14,754 --> 01:39:16,515
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually use your Mii this time around.

1442
01:39:16,795 --> 01:39:25,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you what, the first Kororimpa game, hours of entertainment by making the little Marba the panda ball and changing the sound effects to the farting noise every time it would hit the wall.

1443
01:39:29,525 --> 01:39:33,828
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the game sounds like, it's hours of entertainment because we all are seven at heart.

1444
01:39:34,849 --> 01:39:40,674
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing, now they've built like a story around it, because the first game was just kind of like, eh, just kind of go, but now they're-

1445
01:39:46,345 --> 01:39:48,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on, stop beating around the bush.

1446
01:39:48,106 --> 01:39:49,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Just make a new Marvel Madness game.

1447
01:39:49,166 --> 01:39:49,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, wait, hold on, though.

1448
01:39:49,887 --> 01:39:50,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, though.

1449
01:39:50,307 --> 01:39:51,807
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to listen to this story, okay?

1450
01:39:52,548 --> 01:39:59,251
[SPEAKER_10]: In this game, you are going to go on a quest with a character named Anthony the Ant, and Anthony the Ant is searching for the golden sunflower.

1451
01:40:00,538 --> 01:40:08,844
[SPEAKER_10]: and you guide Anthony's marble around the ant world and you get items that will help you reach the golden sunflower and you will help save Anthony's colony.

1452
01:40:10,105 --> 01:40:16,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, many more dangering mazes, amazing widgets and gadgets to help your little ant friend out.

1453
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:19,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and one more thing.

1454
01:40:20,372 --> 01:40:22,213
[SPEAKER_10]: We connect 24 capability.

1455
01:40:22,513 --> 01:40:24,074
[SPEAKER_10]: You can make your own stages in edit mode.

1456
01:40:25,095 --> 01:40:26,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of neat, huh?

1457
01:40:27,277 --> 01:40:28,558
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the first game should have been.

1458
01:40:29,465 --> 01:40:30,025
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright though.

1459
01:40:30,246 --> 01:40:30,666
[SPEAKER_10]: We forgive him.

1460
01:40:30,926 --> 01:40:33,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, one more game to announce from Hudson.

1461
01:40:33,288 --> 01:40:34,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a Tokyo Game Show.

01:40:39,714 --> 01:40:40,514

[SPEAKER_10]: 14 different arenas.

1467
01:40:43,477 --> 01:40:44,858
[SPEAKER_10]: 4-player local gaming.

01:40:45,138 --> 01:40:47,320
[SPEAKER_10]: You can customize your own Bomberman character.

1469
01:40:47,981 --> 01:40:48,922
[SPEAKER_10]: 50 different costumes.

1470
01:40:49,302 --> 01:40:50,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Adding up to 150,000 possible combinations.

1471
01:40:50,363 --> 01:40:51,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Of which 149,000 probably look like shit.

1472
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:56,921
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1473
01:41:23,871 --> 01:41:26,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we have at least a couple listeners who are going.

1474
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:27,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe so.

1475
01:41:27,923 --> 01:41:30,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it around the Twitter, so I expect many pictures.

1476
01:41:31,283 --> 01:41:48,969
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually certain things that I would like to see, but one that actually I'm very interested in that's only going to be a video only for PlayStation 3 is the game that was the new game done by the creator of Katamari Damashii, which is Keita Takahashi.

1477
01:41:49,049 --> 01:41:56,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Nobi Nobi Boy, and really he just looks sort of green and cylindrical with the prince face.

1478
01:41:57,512 --> 01:42:02,234
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like if they made the Prince of the Cosmos or whatever with a wiener dog.

1479
01:42:03,355 --> 01:42:03,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, right?

1480
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:18,441
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would love for someone to get out a video camera and tape me some footage of that because there hasn't been anything really specific out on it yet except some people playing with something that looked like a dildo.

1481
01:42:19,022 --> 01:42:24,504
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will send you a dollar if you dress up your wiener dog like Noby Noby Boy for Halloween.

1482
01:42:26,372 --> 01:42:27,474
[SPEAKER_04]: One whole dollar?

1483
01:42:27,534 --> 01:42:28,134
[SPEAKER_11]: One whole dollar.

1484
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:29,976
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pure U.S.

1485
01:42:30,136 --> 01:42:31,077
[SPEAKER_11]: currency for you.

1486
01:42:31,598 --> 01:42:35,182
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also another game there that I want someone to tape me footage of so I can see it.

1487
01:42:35,862 --> 01:42:37,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, um, don't laugh.

1488
01:42:38,065 --> 01:42:40,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Anpanmanto Touch de Waku Waku Training.

1489
01:42:41,388 --> 01:42:41,948
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?

1490
01:42:42,128 --> 01:42:42,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Anpanman.

1491
01:42:43,668 --> 01:42:43,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh.

1492
01:42:44,109 --> 01:42:45,569
[SPEAKER_04]: He's cute and made of bread.

1493
01:42:46,089 --> 01:42:46,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1494
01:42:46,809 --> 01:42:49,590
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is some stuff that's actually going to be video only.

1495
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:55,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Nobi Nobi Boy, Galaga Legends for... I'm sorry, Legions for Xbox 360.

1496
01:42:56,671 --> 01:43:04,792
[SPEAKER_04]: On Wii is One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Kotoba No Puzzle, Mojipitan Wii Deluxe, and Progolf for Saru.

1497
01:43:05,092 --> 01:43:06,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't Saru mean monkey?

1498
01:43:06,613 --> 01:43:06,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1499
01:43:08,073 --> 01:43:17,077
[SPEAKER_04]: On DS, the video-only ones are Dr. Slump, Arale-chan, Dragon Ball Origins, and Anpanman To Touch, DewakuWaku Training.

1500
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:17,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone tape it for me.

1501
01:43:18,877 --> 01:43:23,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have on PSP, Idle Master SP, Wandering Star, and Missing Moon.

1502
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:29,162
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2 is Super Robot Taisen Z, and PC, Legend of Galactic Heroes, which is pretty cool.

1503
01:43:29,682 --> 01:43:32,263
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some playable things, though, things of interest.

1504
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:34,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what?

1505
01:43:34,807 --> 01:43:37,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Like whatever happy dance collection is, I guess.

1506
01:43:37,649 --> 01:43:38,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1507
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:40,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Eater, Medusa's Conspiracy.

1508
01:43:41,032 --> 01:43:43,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Soul Eater is a pretty freaking cool manga, what I've seen of it.

1509
01:43:44,214 --> 01:43:48,418
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also, yes, Precure 5, Gogo, Zen and Shugo, Dream Carnival.

1510
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:54,220
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also some Tales of Hearts stuff going on.

1511
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do want to see Macross Ace Frontier.

[SPEAKER_10]: Alrighty.

1515
01:44:08,503 --> 01:44:08,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, cool.

1516
01:44:08,964 --> 01:44:10,444
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Sega?

1517
01:44:12,344 --> 01:44:13,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just listed by systems.

1518
01:44:13,645 --> 01:44:14,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1519
01:44:14,745 --> 01:44:15,085
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

1520
01:44:16,186 --> 01:44:21,230
[SPEAKER_11]: GameStop has now bought a brand new chain in France for $700 million, and they have gained 332 stores out of the deal.

1521
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:21,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And apparently...

1522
01:44:40,497 --> 01:44:47,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, the two stores that they bought, I guess, the Gaming Guild and it's Navigators.

1523
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,561
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess those are a chain.

1524
01:44:50,261 --> 01:44:54,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Micromania, I'm sorry, is the French company.

1525
01:44:55,843 --> 01:44:59,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Micromania, never heard of them, but of course I don't live in France, so.

1526
01:45:01,166 --> 01:45:02,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that kind of scary, though?

1527
01:45:03,507 --> 01:45:07,048
[SPEAKER_11]: They're seriously trying to be like the McDonald's of fucking gaming.

1528
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:09,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, beware, kids.

1529
01:45:10,818 --> 01:45:14,100
[SPEAKER_10]: You will be assimilated into the GameStop collective, apparently.

1530
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:15,821
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of time.

1531
01:45:17,903 --> 01:45:24,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about GameStop taking over the world, it makes me a little bit angsty, especially for the independent shops out there.

1532
01:45:25,208 --> 01:45:28,290
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I get angsty, we play the mean music and say mean things.

1533
01:45:42,396 --> 01:45:44,045
[SPEAKER_10]: and Fuse of the Week time, DarkSakura.

1534
01:45:44,962 --> 01:45:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to me for forgetting one of the stories that I had to do just a moment ago.

1535
01:45:49,004 --> 01:45:51,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to Rob for not actually telling me the story.

1536
01:45:52,005 --> 01:45:53,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to drop a hint.

1537
01:45:54,245 --> 01:45:56,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I'm a little pissed off right now.

1538
01:45:56,846 --> 01:45:57,767
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a lot pissed off.

1539
01:45:58,067 --> 01:45:58,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

1540
01:45:58,887 --> 01:46:03,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I need my... I hurt.

1541
01:46:04,689 --> 01:46:04,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Aww.

1542
01:46:05,709 --> 01:46:10,251
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you goes to my hip hurting like really, really freaking bad.

1543
01:46:11,111 --> 01:46:12,452
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to...

1544
01:46:14,582 --> 01:46:15,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuff in general.

1545
01:46:16,923 --> 01:46:17,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn that stuff.

1546
01:46:18,123 --> 01:46:19,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, stuff just sucks.

1547
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:21,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

1548
01:46:21,664 --> 01:46:30,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like people that run red lights with their cars, I don't know, they think it's fun or something, or they just say forget it, you know.

1549
01:46:32,006 --> 01:46:40,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so yeah, there was a guy today, we're driving, and he just, you know, right turn on a red, and just kind of didn't even stop, just whoo!

1550
01:46:41,365 --> 01:47:08,535
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going and then he pulled right in front of me and went super slow just to add insult to injury and then there's numerous days where I see people just blowing through red lights well after they've turned red because they're in a hurry well good, I hope you murder somebody and end up in jail forever and sued for all the money that you have all few bucks of it and you rot in hell that's it

1551
01:47:10,068 --> 01:47:13,891
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say F you to the Italian dinner I had last night, which was not at Olive Garden.

1552
01:47:13,911 --> 01:47:15,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to another place around here.

1553
01:47:16,072 --> 01:47:19,014
[SPEAKER_10]: And man, I don't know what it was about the food.

1554
01:47:19,074 --> 01:47:23,197
[SPEAKER_10]: It was bad or something because it's like World War III was occurring in my colon.

1555
01:47:23,577 --> 01:47:25,178
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really, really horrible.

1556
01:47:25,318 --> 01:47:26,799
[SPEAKER_10]: So F you to that.

1557
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:32,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if I ate uncooked meat or something.

1558
01:47:32,522 --> 01:47:33,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty terrible.

1559
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:34,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do my story now.

1560

01:49:27,702 --> 01:49:30,464
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember how we talked about that the co-op was going to be delayed via a patch?

1575
01:49:30,524 --> 01:49:37,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, suddenly there's some backtracking this week from the infamous Peter Molyneux, the Lionhead CEO.

1576
01:49:37,189 --> 01:49:41,192
[SPEAKER_10]: He is saying that the co-op actually might be available at launch day.

1577
01:49:42,152 --> 01:49:44,354
[SPEAKER_10]: So now they're kind of going back and forth.

1578
01:49:44,434 --> 01:49:48,397
[SPEAKER_10]: But this was said in some video at a game festival that was going on in Paris.

1579
01:49:48,978 --> 01:49:53,481
[SPEAKER_10]: He said that Fable 2 will have the online co-op at launch, but he can't confirm that.

1580
01:49:55,540 --> 01:50:21,532
[SPEAKER_10]: But the ambition is there But just in case, be prepared for disappointment I'm not sure how exactly I'm supposed to take that It's only about a week of disappointment I know, it'll be all over within a week Which, quite frankly, I have enough games to play anyway I don't fucking need another one But I do still kind of want Fable 2, I gotta admit You need to play Saints Row 2 No, I don't Because you can make all sorts of tranny characters Oh, because that's why I play games, Loki To make tranny characters Exactly!

1581
01:50:21,572 --> 01:50:22,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Who doesn't play games?

1582
01:50:22,192 --> 01:50:23,473
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a sexist comment

1583
01:50:24,332 --> 01:50:25,572
[SPEAKER_11]: How is that a sexist comment?

1584
01:50:25,592 --> 01:50:30,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Tranny is both sexist.

1585
01:50:32,035 --> 01:50:37,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Fable 2 is getting a collector's edition, but it's slowly slipping away.

1586
01:50:38,257 --> 01:50:45,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the cards that were supposed to be in it, the figure and all this stuff, the box itself is not actually going to be there.

1587
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:46,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but the cards will.

1588
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:47,580
[SPEAKER_10]: The cards will be there.

1589
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,520
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the other weird thing.

1590
01:50:50,301 --> 01:50:53,922
[SPEAKER_10]: The cards are going to be there in a downloadable PDF format.

1591
01:50:55,259 --> 01:50:56,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can print your own damn cards.

1592
01:50:58,622 --> 01:51:03,346
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting the feeling nobody pre-ordered the collector's edition and that's why they're suddenly having to do this.

1593
01:51:03,426 --> 01:51:04,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what it is.

1594
01:51:04,567 --> 01:51:04,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you?

1595
01:51:05,727 --> 01:51:06,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1596
01:51:06,468 --> 01:51:09,551
[SPEAKER_11]: How do you feel about the fact that it's suddenly like disappearing?

1597
01:51:09,831 --> 01:51:12,293
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't give a shit about the cards or the DVD or anything.

1598
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:13,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted like...

1599
01:51:13,988 --> 01:51:14,768
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1600
01:51:34,203 --> 01:51:38,584
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm buying it now so I can play it after I'm done with Saints Row 2, which will be for a while.

1601
01:51:38,844 --> 01:51:42,565
[SPEAKER_11]: My friend wants to play Fable 2 co-op, so that sounds kind of like fun.

1602
01:51:42,945 --> 01:51:43,365
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be fun.

1603
01:51:43,745 --> 01:51:47,546
[SPEAKER_11]: But then again, I want to play Saints Row 2 co-op, so I don't know.

1604
01:51:48,086 --> 01:51:50,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Henderson Ma'am says, I wanted the Master Chief outlet.

1605
01:51:50,527 --> 01:51:52,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that the thing they're getting with the pre-order?

1606
01:51:52,688 --> 01:51:54,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that comes with the pre-order still.

1607
01:51:54,728 --> 01:51:58,249
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lightsaber type of weapon or something that you get.

1608
01:51:58,369 --> 01:52:02,010
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also some additional dungeon or something that's coming.

1609
01:52:04,414 --> 01:52:04,894
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it.

1610
01:52:04,954 --> 01:52:07,055
[SPEAKER_11]: And you get like a bonus DVD of behind the scenes crap.

1611
01:52:07,135 --> 01:52:10,136
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of wanted the figurine for my desk and that would have been kind of cool.

1612
01:52:10,456 --> 01:52:15,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have a regular version on order as well in case I decide at the last minute I don't want, you know.

1613
01:52:16,059 --> 01:52:17,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have it on order at work.

1614
01:52:17,519 --> 01:52:18,880
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I can cancel at any time.

1615
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:21,080
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no $5 deposit for me, so.

1616
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:22,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Cancel at any time.

1617
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:25,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you order like 50 of them and then cancel them all?

1618
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:26,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Or will they get mad?

1619
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:28,932
[SPEAKER_10]: They get mad at that.

1620
01:52:29,192 --> 01:52:30,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that is coming out soon.

1621
01:52:30,973 --> 01:52:34,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, speaking of the Master Chief outfit, completely random off-topic story.

1622
01:52:35,196 --> 01:52:40,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to a party store here locally yesterday and you know everybody's gearing up for Halloween, right?

1623
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:43,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you know they're selling a Halo 3 branded Master Chief outfit?

1624
01:52:44,322 --> 01:52:44,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you seen that?

1625
01:52:45,043 --> 01:52:45,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I have seen that.

1626
01:52:46,103 --> 01:52:48,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I was at party stores yesterday.

1627
01:52:48,865 --> 01:52:49,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what's really sad?

1628
01:52:49,906 --> 01:52:51,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Is I was considering buying it.

1629
01:52:51,567 --> 01:52:52,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm kind of pathetic.

1630
01:52:52,847 --> 01:52:54,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it would be fun, wouldn't it?

1631
01:52:54,608 --> 01:52:55,829
[SPEAKER_10]: Dress up as a video game character.

1632
01:52:56,970 --> 01:52:59,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially one as well-known as Master Chief.

1633
01:52:59,591 --> 01:52:59,811
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1634
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:00,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, what?

1635
01:53:01,512 --> 01:53:01,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Um?

1636
01:53:01,712 --> 01:53:03,113
[SPEAKER_04]: You know tons of cosplayers.

1637
01:53:03,133 --> 01:53:04,014
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't have a problem.

1638
01:53:04,094 --> 01:53:04,434
[SPEAKER_10]: True.

1639
01:53:05,134 --> 01:53:06,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I could save that for an army convention.

1640
01:53:06,975 --> 01:53:09,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Our manager in Dallas, he has a kick-ass Halo.

1641
01:53:09,737 --> 01:53:12,118
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he actually bought one of those Halo costumes.

1642
01:53:12,178 --> 01:53:13,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, a custom-made one or something.

1643
01:53:14,740 --> 01:53:17,101
[SPEAKER_11]: He has, like, literally the full outfit.

1644
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:19,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob Chico is the king of the universe.

1645
01:53:20,444 --> 01:53:22,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the king of the cosmos?

1646
01:53:22,044 --> 01:53:22,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be hilarious.

1647
01:53:22,825 --> 01:53:26,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, we're talking about doing that as a Rocky Horror Gold scene at some point, if you even know what I'm talking about.

1648
01:53:27,906 --> 01:53:34,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Deekman in chat, live in our chatroom, chat.orangeonstranger.com says, I saw that at Walmart yesterday here in Canada.

1649
01:53:35,689 --> 01:53:36,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's even at Walmart.

1650
01:53:37,549 --> 01:53:39,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan's shadow is going to be Dr. Horrible.

1651
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:40,690
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a pretty good outfit.

1652
01:53:41,471 --> 01:53:44,072
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I'm hearing is going to be a really popular outfit this year, I heard?

1653
01:53:44,752 --> 01:53:45,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Sarah Palin.

1654
01:53:48,082 --> 01:53:49,084
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my friends is going to Sir.

1655
01:53:49,725 --> 01:53:52,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Deakman says a lot of people won't cancel it regardless.

1656
01:53:52,290 --> 01:53:53,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Going back to the pre-order, speaking of that.

1657
01:53:55,339 --> 01:53:55,739
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1658
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:58,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so Fable 2.

1659
01:53:59,162 --> 01:53:59,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll buy it.

1660
01:53:59,682 --> 01:54:02,884
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll just be one of those games I only have 30 minutes to play, so go figure.

1661
01:54:02,944 --> 01:54:06,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Deekman says my wife is going as Grunty from Banjo-Kazooie.

1662
01:54:06,386 --> 01:54:07,367
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I saw?

1663
01:54:08,007 --> 01:54:11,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone made a costume or at least a guide on how to make it.

1664
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:14,092
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a Sackboy costume that someone made.

1665
01:54:14,792 --> 01:54:15,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, I saw that.

1666
01:54:15,993 --> 01:54:17,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I might actually want to make that.

1667
01:54:18,715 --> 01:54:23,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have a costume to wear and my wife is dressing up as Darthina Vaderina.

1668
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:31,344
[SPEAKER_11]: and pink Barbie-ish secret girlfriend of Darth Vader.

1669
01:54:31,824 --> 01:54:33,766
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going as an awful Mary Sue.

1670
01:54:33,866 --> 01:54:43,893
[SPEAKER_11]: She's literally like, you know, she's dressing, or it kind of looks like her cape's going to be bedazzled and stuff like that.

1671
01:54:44,054 --> 01:54:46,575
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ridiculous, but funny.

1672
01:54:46,836 --> 01:54:49,198
[SPEAKER_10]: SSJ100 Matt says, I'm thinking of going as the Hebrew Hammer.

1673
01:54:50,098 --> 01:54:50,739
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be funny.

1674
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:53,541
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll have to ask this question again on our Twitter or something right before Halloween.

1675
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:54,182
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1676
01:54:54,302 --> 01:54:54,462
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1677
01:54:54,602 --> 01:55:02,549
[SPEAKER_04]: If it wasn't so freaking hot to wear and didn't need to be taken in a bit, I'd wear my Organization XIII costume from YaliCon the other year.

1678
01:55:02,749 --> 01:55:06,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably going to recycle my Jack Skellington costume from last year, because seriously, I paid good money for it.

1679
01:55:06,933 --> 01:55:08,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to wear it more than once.

1680
01:55:08,274 --> 01:55:12,277
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I actually, though, I really want someone... I need to redo the claw.

1681
01:55:12,337 --> 01:55:13,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I could do my Baiken costume.

1682
01:55:13,838 --> 01:55:14,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fun.

1683
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:14,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Show off my boobs.

1684
01:55:15,925 --> 01:55:16,305
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1685
01:55:16,725 --> 01:55:18,446
[SPEAKER_10]: How about you show off the next gaming story?

1686
01:55:18,766 --> 01:55:20,626
[SPEAKER_04]: How about I do just that?

1687
01:55:20,666 --> 01:55:21,287
[SPEAKER_10]: You do it.

1688
01:55:23,207 --> 01:55:27,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for anyone who's been interested in The Force Unleashed, you're getting some treats.

1689
01:55:28,489 --> 01:55:33,010
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting Luke and Obi-Wan, which is pretty freaking cool.

1690
01:55:33,030 --> 01:55:38,131
[SPEAKER_04]: You're also getting Ki-Adi-Mundi and Kit Fisto.

1691
01:55:38,171 --> 01:55:39,772
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a porn star name.

1692
01:55:39,792 --> 01:55:40,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1693
01:55:41,252 --> 01:55:42,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Kid Fisto!

1694
01:55:43,993 --> 01:55:44,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Fisting.

1695
01:55:44,594 --> 01:55:45,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1696
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:47,635
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a pretty cool looking character.

1697
01:55:49,416 --> 01:55:55,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, there's supposed to be new costumes and a new mission.

1698
01:55:56,418 --> 01:56:01,821
[SPEAKER_04]: One for the Jedi Temple and the apprentice will learn more about his father, blah blah blah.

1699
01:56:03,362 --> 01:56:04,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get more stuff.

1700
01:56:05,743 --> 01:56:12,626
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no dates left for the download content packs, but it will be posted at some point, I guess.

1701
01:56:13,807 --> 01:56:14,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty game.

1702
01:56:15,288 --> 01:56:17,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the Sackboy costume looks really easy to make.

1703
01:56:18,029 --> 01:56:21,491
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a sweatshirt and a garbage bag, or a garbage pail.

1704
01:56:21,571 --> 01:56:23,172
[SPEAKER_11]: You should wear a Kit Fisto costume.

1705
01:56:23,948 --> 01:56:24,748
[SPEAKER_11]: and I'll see you next time.

1706

[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, you know... They just want the one night stand.

1715
01:57:33,809 --> 01:57:37,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, too bad for those that were interested in Take-Two, I suppose.

1716
01:57:37,352 --> 01:57:40,374
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, good for them, I guess, sticking to it if they want to stay independent.

1717
01:57:40,895 --> 01:57:46,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, on completely different news, this is a game, another, god, another freaking game I want to get this year.

1718
01:57:46,319 --> 01:57:47,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not going to have time for it.

1719
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:48,821
[SPEAKER_10]: The Last Remnant.

1720
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:51,543
[SPEAKER_10]: The Last Remnant, you know, it's coming out worldwide.

1721
01:57:51,643 --> 01:57:58,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Japan, of course, one place that they really need to sell more Xbox 360s, even though, you know, they've had a lot of good luck and some turnaround thanks to Tales of Vesperia.

1722
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:01,431
[SPEAKER_10]: They're gonna try to do that even more with The Last Remnant.

1723
01:58:01,471 --> 01:58:05,654
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a special Xbox 360 bundle that's gonna be coming out in Japan.

1724
01:58:05,754 --> 01:58:12,639
[SPEAKER_10]: This box is gonna come with a DVD remote, the game, a faceplate, and a soundtrack CD.

1725
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:15,422
[SPEAKER_10]: That's $331 for all that shit together.

1726
01:58:15,462 --> 01:58:17,984
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about $30 off of what it would cost separately.

1727
01:58:18,922 --> 01:58:23,045
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're hoping that's going to push them over the million Xbox 360 sold in Japan mark.

1728
01:58:23,305 --> 01:58:24,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's pretty big.

1729
01:58:25,607 --> 01:58:28,990
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, Tales of Vesperia has been very good at helping them get there.

1730
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:31,732
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit Infinite Undiscovery, too, as well.

1731
01:58:32,473 --> 01:58:37,517
[SPEAKER_10]: The Last Remnant, by the way, though, is not solely on the Xbox 360.

1732
01:58:37,557 --> 01:58:39,999
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be coming out on the PlayStation 3, but later.

1733
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:43,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So Xbox 360 does get a little bit of an exclusive window.

1734
01:58:43,181 --> 01:58:43,882
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1735
01:58:44,422 --> 01:58:45,303
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot of stuff, too.

1736
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:50,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're waiting in Japan, now might be a good time.

1737
01:58:50,981 --> 01:58:54,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, now's a good time for us to go and open the email bag.

1738
01:58:54,602 --> 01:59:02,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick a few of our favorites to read here on the program and that's what we're going to do right now.

1739
01:59:02,685 --> 01:59:05,326
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura's going to dive in the mail bag and read some emails.

1740
01:59:05,746 --> 01:59:06,707
[SPEAKER_10]: How many emails do we have tonight?

1741
01:59:07,947 --> 01:59:08,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Five!

1742
01:59:09,408 --> 01:59:09,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1743
01:59:09,748 --> 01:59:11,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make it quick.

1744
01:59:11,869 --> 01:59:12,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Five emails.

1745
01:59:12,429 --> 01:59:12,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Here we go.

1746
01:59:13,628 --> 01:59:15,870
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one comes from Daniel.

1747
01:59:16,550 --> 01:59:19,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear this is going to be my last email regarding Warhammer Online.

1748
01:59:19,652 --> 01:59:23,335
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm calling all MMO gamers to join the order on the Iron Fist server.

1749
01:59:24,155 --> 01:59:34,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get a guild together, but because the hours I work 2pm until 11pm Monday through Saturday Thank you for telling us your hours, I will find out where you work.

1750
01:59:35,263 --> 01:59:36,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's becoming difficult.

1751
01:59:36,924 --> 01:59:39,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a close group of experienced MMO gamers I'm going to stalk the Iron Fist.

1752
01:59:40,928 --> 01:59:48,674
[SPEAKER_04]: on this server already, but we have all work similar hours, so none of us are in-game during peak hours.

1753
01:59:49,114 --> 01:59:51,956
[SPEAKER_04]: The game really requires you to be in a guild to get some extra bonuses.

1754
01:59:52,357 --> 01:59:52,737
[SPEAKER_04]: P.M.

1755
01:59:53,638 --> 01:59:54,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Ballhair?

1756
01:59:56,720 --> 01:59:57,661
[SPEAKER_04]: With three L's.

1757
01:59:57,761 --> 02:00:06,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's B-A-L-L-L-H-A-I-R

1758
02:00:10,494 --> 02:00:28,026
[SPEAKER_09]: or PunkyDunch if interested I like how these guys are sending us an email about look we're on this roleplay server and we really want our guild to be taken seriously we can't figure out why people won't join our guild

1759
02:00:29,287 --> 02:00:30,467
[SPEAKER_09]: and play this game with us.

1760
02:00:30,847 --> 02:00:32,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's our work hours.

1761
02:00:32,488 --> 02:00:33,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1762
02:00:33,768 --> 02:00:35,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Please send a message to Ball Air.

1763
02:00:38,629 --> 02:00:40,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob is turning red in the face.

1764
02:00:40,109 --> 02:00:40,869
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cute.

1765
02:00:45,630 --> 02:00:45,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1766
02:00:47,171 --> 02:00:47,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Look.

1767
02:00:47,731 --> 02:00:47,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob.

1768
02:00:48,571 --> 02:00:48,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not.

1769
02:00:49,271 --> 02:00:49,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

1770
02:00:50,851 --> 02:00:51,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Punky dunch.

1771
02:00:53,132 --> 02:00:53,952
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's funny too.

1772
02:00:57,097 --> 02:01:01,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think that person might have just made this whole story up just to get us to say those names on here?

1773
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:05,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I think possibly that whole thing was a trap to get you to say ball hair.

1774
02:01:05,822 --> 02:01:06,283
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1775
02:01:06,343 --> 02:01:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say ball hair anyway.

1776
02:01:08,804 --> 02:01:09,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball hair!

1777
02:01:11,946 --> 02:01:13,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also say sweaty balls.

1778
02:01:15,808 --> 02:01:16,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1779
02:01:17,129 --> 02:01:18,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not afraid to go there, Rob.

1780
02:01:18,970 --> 02:01:19,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I know.

1781
02:01:19,851 --> 02:01:20,351
[SPEAKER_10]: You live there.

1782
02:01:20,391 --> 02:01:21,152
[SPEAKER_10]: You own a house there.

1783
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:22,550
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.

1784
02:01:22,671 --> 02:01:24,232
[SPEAKER_04]: LittleBigPlanet is insane.

1785
02:01:24,712 --> 02:01:28,996
[SPEAKER_04]: On the surface, it's a cute platformer, but once you dive into the level builder, you will be hooked.

1786
02:01:29,877 --> 02:01:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It is difficult but addictive.

1787
02:01:31,138 --> 02:01:34,581
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite things about it is the ability to borrow someone's creations.

1788
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:39,105
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone else makes a really cool figure or building, you can borrow it and put it on your own stages.

1789
02:01:39,545 --> 02:01:41,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Look on YouTube for some really cool creations.

1790
02:01:41,527 --> 02:01:46,051
[SPEAKER_04]: The body level and LittleBigColossus are some of the more popular levels out there.

1791
02:01:48,325 --> 02:01:49,906
[SPEAKER_04]: That's from Daniel, a.k.a.

1792
02:01:50,227 --> 02:01:50,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball Hair.

1793
02:01:50,787 --> 02:01:54,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan's in chat right now and says, no, it's real, I swear.

1794
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:57,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should sign all your letters, Ball Hair.

1795
02:01:57,032 --> 02:01:58,413
[SPEAKER_10]: He is Ball Hair the Dwarf.

1796
02:01:58,894 --> 02:01:59,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball Hair.

1797
02:01:59,394 --> 02:02:00,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, it's awesome.

1798
02:02:00,695 --> 02:02:02,517
[SPEAKER_10]: No, dude, it is awesome.

1799
02:02:02,597 --> 02:02:03,497
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the whole thing.

1800
02:02:03,537 --> 02:02:04,738
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just really funny.

1801
02:02:04,799 --> 02:02:05,359
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1802
02:02:05,419 --> 02:02:07,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because the whole setup of the email and everything.

1803
02:02:08,261 --> 02:02:10,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to have fanfare for you.

1804
02:02:10,543 --> 02:02:12,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball Hair the Dwarf.

1805
02:02:14,568 --> 02:02:15,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I move on?

1806
02:02:15,889 --> 02:02:16,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1807
02:02:17,211 --> 02:02:18,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, folks!

1808
02:02:19,253 --> 02:02:20,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a few questions for you.

1809
02:02:20,795 --> 02:02:25,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you might have some possible answers and slash or feedback.

1810
02:02:26,301 --> 02:02:33,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering how retro gaming is on consoles nowadays, as well as indie games, see Everyday Shooter, Mega Man 9, X-Men, etc.

1811
02:02:33,489 --> 02:02:34,029
[SPEAKER_04]: for reference.

1812
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:38,151
[SPEAKER_04]: I have decided to make my own games for both the 360 and PS3.

1813
02:02:38,171 --> 02:02:47,574
[SPEAKER_04]: The catch is, the last game I made was a borderline pornographic mod of an Apple IIe edutainment game originally called Turtle Trot.

1814
02:02:48,734 --> 02:02:53,496
[SPEAKER_04]: What classes should I take, or alternatively, what books should I read and what programming languages should I learn?

1815
02:02:53,856 --> 02:02:56,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Are most games using the C languages or a variation thereof?

1816
02:02:56,877 --> 02:02:57,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I have no fucking clue.

1817
02:02:59,602 --> 02:03:01,103
[SPEAKER_10]: To actually learn how to write games?

1818
02:03:01,123 --> 02:03:02,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You should write them in BASIC.

1819
02:03:02,724 --> 02:03:06,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And release it on the TI computer.

1820
02:03:06,287 --> 02:03:09,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, that's not a bad point to email.

1821
02:03:09,209 --> 02:03:13,431
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll tell you, when I was in school studying computer science, C++ was where you started.

1822
02:03:13,752 --> 02:03:15,593
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of those things where you have to start somewhere.

1823
02:03:15,653 --> 02:03:19,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, programming languages aren't that much different.

1824
02:03:20,016 --> 02:03:20,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they are and they aren't.

1825
02:03:20,977 --> 02:03:22,778
[SPEAKER_10]: The way you learn...

1826
02:03:23,098 --> 02:03:23,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1827
02:03:23,678 --> 02:03:29,941
[SPEAKER_10]: The way you learn languages is that whole logic, if, then, and building flowcharts in your mind.

1828
02:03:30,301 --> 02:03:33,043
[SPEAKER_10]: And any language is going to be a foot in the door at that.

1829
02:03:33,343 --> 02:03:39,565
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you want something to be practical and learn something, you go with C or the languages that are really out there.

1830
02:03:39,846 --> 02:03:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I have to say something.

1831
02:03:41,846 --> 02:03:42,207
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

1832
02:03:42,527 --> 02:03:44,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my flowchart is in my mind.

1833
02:03:47,349 --> 02:03:47,749
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1834
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:50,971
[SPEAKER_04]: As for the rest of the email?

1835
02:03:51,611 --> 02:03:51,771
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1836
02:03:52,478 --> 02:03:57,982
[SPEAKER_04]: In case you're wondering, I'm looking to develop games that have the look and feel of old school 8 and 16-bit arcade and console games.

1837
02:03:58,403 --> 02:04:07,930
[SPEAKER_04]: This catches that A, they're simple to pick up and learn, B, difficult to master, C, fun, and D, they have my goofy, corny, off-the-wall sense of humor injected into them.

1838
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:16,096
[SPEAKER_04]: An example would be an NPC in an adventure game complaining about being forced to pace back and forth in a certain path and saying the same thing over and over again to adventurers.

1839
02:04:16,737 --> 02:04:21,180
[SPEAKER_04]: In a fit of rage or fed up, he declares that he quits and orders the gaming gods to take his job and shove it.

1840
02:04:23,106 --> 02:04:24,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That came from Spazinator, by the way.

1841
02:04:26,148 --> 02:04:28,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, what was the question in there?

1842
02:04:28,349 --> 02:04:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: What games have that type of... That's what he said his goals for making the games.

1843
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:34,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I see.

1844
02:04:35,233 --> 02:04:35,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1845
02:04:35,673 --> 02:04:38,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, you're probably the closest thing we have on staff to a programmer.

1846
02:04:38,475 --> 02:04:39,275
[SPEAKER_10]: What are your thoughts on this?

1847
02:04:40,636 --> 02:04:42,857
[SPEAKER_10]: For someone that doesn't program, I'm pretty good.

1848
02:04:43,458 --> 02:04:45,099
[SPEAKER_11]: You hack and stuff, but I don't know.

1849
02:04:45,819 --> 02:04:46,880
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any thoughts on this?

1850
02:04:46,920 --> 02:04:47,920
[SPEAKER_03]: He hacks with a butter knife.

1851
02:04:48,361 --> 02:04:48,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1852
02:04:49,534 --> 02:04:57,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, if you're trying to get into it professionally, I guess, then, like, C would be good, or, like, Visual Basic or something like that.

1853
02:04:57,773 --> 02:04:57,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1854
02:05:00,097 --> 02:05:23,332
[SPEAKER_11]: probably if you're just doing it for fun and you want to do something like that there's like GameMaker 7 that I don't know if you've seen there was that Mario game that had like the Mega Man levels and all that like crazy shit in it that was made with GameMaker 7 so you can actually make full like games out of it and distribute them to your friends and that kind of thing and that's what you're interested in you know doing um

1855
02:05:25,447 --> 02:05:26,528
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, that's pretty much it.

1856
02:05:26,748 --> 02:05:27,289
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Bobby.

1857
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:28,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1858
02:05:28,851 --> 02:05:29,311
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck to you.

1859
02:05:29,531 --> 02:05:30,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Pass off the blame.

1860
02:05:31,033 --> 02:05:31,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email?

1861
02:05:31,794 --> 02:05:32,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, next email.

1862
02:05:32,695 --> 02:05:34,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello cast of OLR, especially Loki.

1863
02:05:36,004 --> 02:05:36,464
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki,

1864
02:05:58,121 --> 02:06:08,706
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a Guitar Hero controller for PS2 and another system that's wired, you can get a converter that will allow you to plug in these controllers and play.

1865
02:06:09,566 --> 02:06:18,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, if you decide to get this game, at first it sucks because the game itself has a lot of bugs, which makes it bad, and it looks nothing like Guitar Hero 3, but if you...

1866
02:06:19,731 --> 02:06:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it, download the Elyrian mod because it's designed to make it look and feel just like Guitar Hero 3.

1867
02:06:23,634 --> 02:06:28,797
[SPEAKER_04]: The best thing about this game is that you can add your own songs and download ones made by other people.

1868
02:06:28,977 --> 02:06:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, all of the real gaming companies like Activision and Harmonix have released songpacks for each of their games that are exactly the same as the real ones.

1869
02:06:37,703 --> 02:06:43,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me laugh because Guitar Hero 3 is on PC, but you can just download the songs for Farts on Fire and play them for free, so please check it out.

1870
02:06:44,007 --> 02:06:44,688
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Blade 3.

1871
02:06:45,288 --> 02:06:47,609
[SPEAKER_11]: P.S.

1872
02:06:49,110 --> 02:06:50,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry this email is so long.

1873
02:06:50,450 --> 02:06:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for reading it.

1874
02:06:51,190 --> 02:06:51,630
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S.S.

1875
02:06:51,650 --> 02:06:53,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I passed the grammar Nazis test.

1876
02:06:54,191 --> 02:06:56,112
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you didn't because you didn't punctuate that sentence.

1877
02:06:56,893 --> 02:06:59,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last one was a run-on sentence and also Nazis spelled N-A-Z-I.

1878
02:07:01,134 --> 02:07:23,836
[SPEAKER_11]: um not with a t they also have a game called guitar fun on the wii that's basically the same thing and you can use that for like a homebrew stuff plus now the new version has usb support so you can use your usb guitars uh i think for rock band um and then you can also use usb keyboards if you want to um and that's also available and i think you can do two player on that you can also do uh

1879
02:07:25,578 --> 02:07:25,938
[SPEAKER_11]: May I continue?

1880
02:07:50,788 --> 02:07:52,089
[SPEAKER_04]: you may, I shall

1881
02:08:10,407 --> 02:08:12,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, is that the old, old-ass game?

1882
02:08:12,289 --> 02:08:13,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the one I mentioned.

1883
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:14,611
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I mentioned this last week.

1884
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:16,293
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's a remake of Pipe Dream.

1885
02:08:16,373 --> 02:08:20,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I was going to say, that game is like... God, they had the game on the Commodore 64.

1886
02:08:20,376 --> 02:08:22,098
[SPEAKER_10]: That shit is old school.

1887
02:08:22,799 --> 02:08:23,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a very simple puzzle.

1888
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:24,540
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like Tetris.

1889
02:08:25,121 --> 02:08:26,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also like Bioshock's hacking.

1890
02:08:27,363 --> 02:08:28,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, yes, yes, it is.

1891
02:08:30,031 --> 02:08:31,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to continue.

1892
02:08:31,332 --> 02:08:31,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

1893
02:08:33,513 --> 02:08:36,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd never heard of the video game My Boyfriend, but it came out this week.

1894
02:08:36,955 --> 02:08:46,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it can't be as bad as Imagine Babies, or whatever horrible crime against grammar Ubisoft perpetrated against the English language while concocting the spelling of that game's name.

1895
02:08:46,201 --> 02:08:47,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, you did spell it correctly.

1896
02:08:49,003 --> 02:08:55,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And regardless, the game is called My Boyfriend, and apparently the game lets the player, as a teenage girl, have her first boyfriend.

1897
02:08:56,327 --> 02:08:57,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that I haven't heard of.

1898
02:08:57,588 --> 02:09:01,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I can play as a boy and that would make it the most awesome game ever.

1899
02:09:02,009 --> 02:09:08,232
[SPEAKER_04]: While your news is usually awesome and definitely entertaining to listen to, I just wanted to point out these two horrible omissions in your release sources.

1900
02:09:08,672 --> 02:09:09,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Hephaestus.

1901
02:09:10,012 --> 02:09:15,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I mentioned Pipe Mania last time we did releases and yes, I did mention the exact same stuff.

1902
02:09:15,334 --> 02:09:18,856
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a remake of Pipe Dream and it's the same thing as the hacking in it.

1903
02:09:18,996 --> 02:09:21,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember specifically saying that because I have to sell this crap.

1904
02:09:21,757 --> 02:09:25,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I kind of want to play that one though because it makes me think of Tokimeki Girlside.

1905
02:09:26,192 --> 02:09:27,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you want to... Let's see.

1906
02:09:27,332 --> 02:09:30,974
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to... What other games are people going to accuse me of forgetting to mention?

1907
02:09:31,034 --> 02:09:38,796
[SPEAKER_11]: Gravity, which is a game that's going to be coming out that's kind of like the... Was it Pocket Physics game that's out now?

1908
02:09:38,856 --> 02:09:39,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, that sounds cool.

1909
02:09:40,717 --> 02:09:42,617
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also... I like physics.

1910
02:09:43,057 --> 02:09:52,480
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also a crappy Rubik's World game that's coming out later on that's like Rubik's Cube stuff, but they're trying to make it expanded and it's going to be like a puzzle game and stuff.

1911
02:09:53,641 --> 02:09:53,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

1912
02:09:56,158 --> 02:09:59,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to think of what else that people might be remotely interested in.

1913
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:01,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1914
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:02,560
[SPEAKER_11]: I just mentioned everything.

1915
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:04,200
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't miss a thing.

1916
02:10:04,861 --> 02:10:09,842
[SPEAKER_10]: A face that's in chat right now says, by the way, my boyfriend is totally a bad GTA clone.

1917
02:10:09,982 --> 02:10:14,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say there was a story about this a long, long time ago on the show.

1918
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:19,825
[SPEAKER_04]: The company that made my boyfriend apparently also made a PC game called So Blonde.

1919
02:10:21,158 --> 02:10:21,418
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura

1920
02:10:43,251 --> 02:10:43,911
[SPEAKER_10]: And us now.

1921
02:10:44,611 --> 02:10:47,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you had moved out here, you would never have met me.

1922
02:10:47,692 --> 02:10:51,313
[SPEAKER_04]: If not for my husband, I would never have been the internet celebrity I am today.

1923
02:10:51,513 --> 02:10:51,953
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1924
02:10:53,394 --> 02:10:54,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Or as Actdeft calls him, Edan.

1925
02:10:55,134 --> 02:10:57,314
[SPEAKER_04]: He facilitates my rock and roll lifestyle.

1926
02:10:58,635 --> 02:10:59,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Or lack thereof.

1927
02:11:00,335 --> 02:11:01,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So, last email?

1928
02:11:01,275 --> 02:11:01,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, last email.

1929
02:11:02,356 --> 02:11:04,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear OLR, oh, we're dear.

1930
02:11:04,876 --> 02:11:11,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to say that yesterday's show, the 28th, was my first time listening live while interacting with the chat room.

1931
02:11:11,838 --> 02:11:12,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1932
02:11:28,892 --> 02:11:44,555
[SPEAKER_04]: if this gets read on air this statement needs to be made if you love the podcast and only listen via the podcast you're doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing all the OLR has to offer there's also some post show goodness to be found on occasion which is definitely also worth your time well thank you

1933
02:11:44,795 --> 02:11:46,677
[SPEAKER_10]: God, you'd think we'd paid somebody to write that.

1934
02:11:46,717 --> 02:11:47,397
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very sweet.

1935
02:11:47,617 --> 02:11:49,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we didn't because we don't have any money.

1936
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:50,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1937
02:11:50,700 --> 02:11:51,701
[SPEAKER_04]: We used that all up in Seattle.

1938
02:11:53,142 --> 02:11:57,125
[SPEAKER_04]: At the risk of sounding like a complete suck-up, I'm going to end the email.

1939
02:11:59,107 --> 02:12:06,353
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, I would just like to remind the OLR staff how awesome they are and reiterate that every listener should go to the chat room sometime.

1940
02:12:07,014 --> 02:12:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I will be listening live and chatting every week that I'm able.

1941
02:12:10,276 --> 02:12:12,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's hoping everyone listens live sonic

1942
02:12:13,479 --> 02:12:14,059
[SPEAKER_04]: and Mediate.

1943
02:12:14,559 --> 02:12:17,480
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I have to commend your spelling and your grammar.

1944
02:12:17,981 --> 02:12:18,841
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.

1945
02:12:18,961 --> 02:12:19,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's freaking gorgeous.

1946
02:12:19,961 --> 02:12:21,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, a rare compliment.

1947
02:12:22,062 --> 02:12:22,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

1948
02:12:23,062 --> 02:12:26,284
[SPEAKER_10]: See, that's how you get DarkSakura to kiss your ass is kiss her ass.

1949
02:12:26,604 --> 02:12:28,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1950
02:12:28,504 --> 02:12:32,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, because, you know, I'm used to, and it's kind of hard.

1951
02:12:32,866 --> 02:12:38,148
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't catch it so much in myself, but I catch it in other people's writing because I've gotten kind of used to being the beta reader.

1952
02:12:38,968 --> 02:12:39,508
[SPEAKER_04]: But, wow.

1953
02:12:41,289 --> 02:12:43,170
[SPEAKER_04]: This is actually very, very well done.

1954
02:12:43,210 --> 02:12:43,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1955
02:12:43,971 --> 02:12:46,052
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually a good question in chat.

1956
02:12:46,072 --> 02:12:48,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever happened to the midday show for the European listeners?

1957
02:12:48,334 --> 02:12:49,134
[SPEAKER_10]: We still need to do that.

1958
02:12:49,775 --> 02:12:50,355
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point.

1959
02:12:51,016 --> 02:12:53,197
[SPEAKER_10]: It's probably realistically not going to happen until after 300.

1960
02:12:55,359 --> 02:13:03,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how much I want to get into this now until I know some details, but I'm going to be off for several shows in a row because I'm having surgery.

1961
02:13:03,724 --> 02:13:05,466
[SPEAKER_10]: If you've been listening to the show, I just don't know when.

1962
02:13:05,966 --> 02:13:07,067
[SPEAKER_10]: The when is the big question mark.

1963
02:13:07,087 --> 02:13:08,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob's having a pancreactomy.

1964
02:13:09,329 --> 02:13:10,829
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not, I, well, no.

1965
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:13,610
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's having a duodenumectomy.

1966
02:13:13,990 --> 02:13:16,311
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I get the gallbladder out, which is the surgery I'm having.

1967
02:13:16,351 --> 02:13:17,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's having a stomachectomy.

1968
02:13:17,431 --> 02:13:17,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

1969
02:13:18,412 --> 02:13:19,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm getting a face job.

1970
02:13:20,432 --> 02:13:22,753
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, I'm going to have the gallbladder out, which is very common.

1971
02:13:22,773 --> 02:13:24,133
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure plenty of our listeners have had it done.

1972
02:13:24,173 --> 02:13:26,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not that worried about it, except for the fact it's just surgery.

1973
02:13:26,674 --> 02:13:30,015
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, there's going to be recovery time, and I have no OLR for me while I'm recovering.

1974
02:13:30,055 --> 02:13:32,676
[SPEAKER_10]: So probably at least two, if not three weeks, I'm going to be out.

1975
02:13:33,536 --> 02:13:35,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know what's going to happen to the show during that time.

1976
02:13:35,557 --> 02:13:36,757
[SPEAKER_04]: The return of Pump Up the Volume.

1977
02:13:36,977 --> 02:13:37,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

1978
02:13:38,358 --> 02:13:40,220
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, something will happen.

1979
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:41,541
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am not missing episode 300.

1980
02:13:41,581 --> 02:13:47,285
[SPEAKER_10]: We will put this damn show on hiatus at 299 if I'm having the surgery in two weeks, which I don't think I am.

1981
02:13:48,206 --> 02:13:49,046
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll figure out something.

1982
02:13:49,086 --> 02:13:49,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll figure something out.

1983
02:13:49,787 --> 02:13:50,147
[SPEAKER_10]: We always do.

1984
02:13:50,327 --> 02:13:53,029
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll bring the computer in to Rob's bedside.

1985
02:13:53,310 --> 02:13:54,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Live from surgery.

1986
02:13:54,691 --> 02:13:55,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Live from my bedroom.

1987
02:13:55,772 --> 02:13:56,672
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1988
02:13:57,313 --> 02:13:59,014
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put your surgery on Justin TV.

1989
02:13:59,034 --> 02:14:03,838
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be just, it would be almost Shakespearean to have episode 300 from the hospital.

1990
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:08,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

1991
02:14:08,531 --> 02:14:11,972
[SPEAKER_04]: We should totally, seriously, webcast your surgery.

1992
02:14:12,972 --> 02:14:14,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not Katie Couric, for fuck's sake.

1993
02:14:15,092 --> 02:14:15,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1994
02:14:15,693 --> 02:14:17,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Seg says, need a guest host.

1995
02:14:17,433 --> 02:14:19,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we always want guests.

1996
02:14:19,834 --> 02:14:20,694
[SPEAKER_10]: So come up, be on the show.

1997
02:14:20,874 --> 02:14:22,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Bobby should fly out here.

1998
02:14:22,575 --> 02:14:23,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1999
02:14:23,795 --> 02:14:25,535
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the end of the segment tonight, yes?

2000
02:14:25,875 --> 02:14:26,396
[SPEAKER_10]: For the mailbag?

2001
02:14:26,736 --> 02:14:27,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2002
02:14:27,356 --> 02:14:30,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we want to thank our sponsor for tonight's... Let's fly Tiara back out here.

2003
02:14:30,837 --> 02:14:33,338
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to thank tonight's sponsor for our mailbag segment.

2004
02:14:33,358 --> 02:14:34,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Sauce is going to be our guest host.

2005
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:51,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Give it up for tonight's sponsor, everybody.

2006
02:14:52,705 --> 02:14:54,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hair!

2007
02:14:54,247 --> 02:14:55,268
[SPEAKER_09]: The dwarf!

2008
02:14:59,692 --> 02:15:00,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get it.

2009
02:15:01,107 --> 02:15:02,007
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just kidding, I do get it.

2010
02:15:02,027 --> 02:15:02,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, good.

2011
02:15:02,808 --> 02:15:04,448
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, don't make me explain it to you.

2012
02:15:04,929 --> 02:15:05,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's move on.

2013
02:15:06,029 --> 02:15:10,551
[SPEAKER_10]: A couple more gaming news stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and hopefully we'll get some calls.

2014
02:15:11,471 --> 02:15:20,655
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there's plenty of ways to save money with your car insurance, but there may be a new way soon, especially if you're of the old variety.

2015
02:15:22,095 --> 02:15:29,178
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, there is Allstate, and they're, I guess, testing a new...

2016
02:15:31,041 --> 02:15:31,281
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura,

2017
02:15:52,595 --> 02:15:56,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Also kind of just different reflex tests and that kind of stuff.

2018
02:15:57,017 --> 02:16:02,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're seeing if the performance in that game correlates to how safe the drivers are.

2019
02:16:02,379 --> 02:16:08,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they find that to be true, then you may get discounts based on how well you perform in a game.

2020
02:16:09,561 --> 02:16:10,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Or how often you play said game.

2021
02:16:11,202 --> 02:16:13,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope they do the tests on Crazy Taxi.

2022
02:16:14,503 --> 02:16:15,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy Taxi.

2023
02:16:16,004 --> 02:16:18,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ready to save some crazy money.

2024
02:16:19,805 --> 02:16:21,586
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like a future Geico commercial right there.

2025
02:16:24,042 --> 02:16:26,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, who knew some video games might actually save me money in the future?

2026
02:16:30,488 --> 02:16:32,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think this is really going to happen though?

2027
02:16:32,210 --> 02:16:37,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is this like one of those things where like so-and-so says something to so-and-so and now it's like fact?

2028
02:16:37,615 --> 02:16:40,378
[SPEAKER_11]: It's less of a game, more of like software.

2029
02:16:40,518 --> 02:16:41,919
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't even call it a game.

2030
02:16:44,182 --> 02:16:44,502
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2031
02:16:45,458 --> 02:16:49,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, we are going to be opening the Skype line very soon to your calls.

2032
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:55,945
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so you definitely should be adding us on there.

2033
02:16:56,766 --> 02:17:05,391
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, we have one more story for you tonight about, what else, the most important video game of the 21st century.

2034
02:17:09,194 --> 02:17:10,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course I mean SingStar ABBA.

2035
02:17:13,467 --> 02:17:15,348
[SPEAKER_10]: It is being released on December 2nd.

2036
02:17:16,669 --> 02:17:18,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And the track listings have been announced.

2037
02:17:18,551 --> 02:17:22,474
[SPEAKER_10]: There are going to be 20 tracks on the PlayStation 2 for $30.

2038
02:17:23,955 --> 02:17:26,757
[SPEAKER_10]: 25 tracks on the PlayStation 3 for $40.

2039
02:17:28,618 --> 02:17:30,300
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, Dancing Queen's on both.

2040
02:17:32,101 --> 02:17:34,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the highlights from both track lists.

2041
02:17:34,285 --> 02:17:43,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Chiquiquita, Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man After Midnight, Take A Chance On Me, SOS, Dancing Queen, Fernando, I Do I Do I Do,

2042
02:17:44,557 --> 02:17:49,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Knowing Me, Knowing You, The Winner Takes It All, Mamma Mia, Money, Money, Money, and of course, Waterloo.

2043
02:17:49,899 --> 02:17:55,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the exclusives on the PlayStation 3 that you will not see on the PlayStation 2, if you were curious, I know I was.

2044
02:17:56,441 --> 02:18:05,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Under Attack, When All Is Said And Done, which by the way is my favorite of the song ever, and Head Over Heels, and Happy New Year, and The Day Before You Came are the five.

2045
02:18:07,887 --> 02:18:10,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So that goes out to all two of you that care about that news.

2046
02:18:10,749 --> 02:18:13,751
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm telling you, this game is going to be epic.

2047
02:18:14,092 --> 02:18:14,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I care.

2048
02:18:14,512 --> 02:18:15,253
[SPEAKER_10]: In so many ways.

2049
02:18:15,333 --> 02:18:15,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I care too.

2050
02:18:17,554 --> 02:18:18,475
[SPEAKER_04]: When's it coming out in the U.S.?

2051
02:18:18,635 --> 02:18:19,396
[SPEAKER_10]: December 2nd.

2052
02:18:19,696 --> 02:18:20,657
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, Rob?

2053
02:18:21,837 --> 02:18:23,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I might have to pick it up.

2054
02:18:24,646 --> 02:18:25,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to pick it up.

2055
02:18:26,228 --> 02:18:39,680
[SPEAKER_10]: My PlayStation 3, I told America, and the world, I told the world, not just America, we have listeners all over the world, I told the world, I will buy the PlayStation 3 when that one game comes out that I have to have.

2056
02:18:40,621 --> 02:18:42,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is coming December 2nd.

2057
02:18:42,403 --> 02:18:43,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even Final Fantasy.

2058
02:18:43,384 --> 02:18:44,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and there's LittleBigPlanet too.

2059
02:18:44,905 --> 02:18:46,327
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's SingStar ABBA.

2060
02:18:47,054 --> 02:18:48,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't speak for DarkSakura

2061
02:19:08,413 --> 02:19:10,053
[SPEAKER_10]: and I certainly can't speak for Loki.

2062
02:19:10,414 --> 02:19:11,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you can.

2063
02:19:11,434 --> 02:19:13,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And Loki says no.

2064
02:19:14,335 --> 02:19:25,377
[SPEAKER_10]: But I will do a Justin TV special even if I have to get my fabulous friends over here to play the game with me like Extifer and Irene and Victoria and some of the fabulous friends.

2065
02:19:25,477 --> 02:19:26,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Get me drunk enough, I'll do it.

2066
02:19:27,935 --> 02:19:29,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, Deekman asks a good point.

2067
02:19:29,296 --> 02:19:31,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't these just be DLC for the current SingStar?

2068
02:19:31,818 --> 02:19:33,199
[SPEAKER_10]: That actually isn't a bad question.

2069
02:19:33,599 --> 02:19:37,842
[SPEAKER_10]: But something as momentous as ABBA deserves its own release.

2070
02:19:37,902 --> 02:19:38,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you think?

2071
02:19:38,503 --> 02:19:39,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, shit.

2072
02:19:39,604 --> 02:19:55,335
[SPEAKER_10]: If a little podunk band like ACDC, a little band that nobody's heard of called Aerosmith, this no-name thing out of the Bay Area named Metallica, if they can all get their games, why can't ABBA have their own damn game?

2073
02:19:56,516 --> 02:19:57,557
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have to give you your record.

2074
02:19:58,936 --> 02:19:59,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, you do.

2075
02:20:00,177 --> 02:20:02,659
[SPEAKER_04]: When Ranma was here, he got Rob an ABBA album.

2076
02:20:02,859 --> 02:20:03,720
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing, by the way.

2077
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:04,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Got him Super Trooper.

2078
02:20:04,981 --> 02:20:05,682
[SPEAKER_10]: That's amazing.

2079
02:20:06,222 --> 02:20:07,563
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what's going in the blank spot.

2080
02:20:09,104 --> 02:20:09,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Pinball.

2081
02:20:09,985 --> 02:20:10,285
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2082
02:20:10,866 --> 02:20:11,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll just rearrange.

2083
02:20:11,847 --> 02:20:14,068
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some of these, I mean, Poppin' Music 11.

2084
02:20:14,109 --> 02:20:14,689
[SPEAKER_10]: How old is that?

2085
02:20:14,949 --> 02:20:15,450
[SPEAKER_10]: That can come now.

2086
02:20:15,470 --> 02:20:16,350
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's still cute.

2087
02:20:16,410 --> 02:20:17,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You should give that to me.

2088
02:20:17,812 --> 02:20:18,652
[SPEAKER_10]: The other one is Autograph.

2089
02:20:18,672 --> 02:20:19,913
[SPEAKER_10]: You know this Dear Friends poster?

2090
02:20:19,933 --> 02:20:22,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it comes through on JustTV, but there's no Bowie Matsu's autograph right there.

2091
02:20:23,316 --> 02:20:24,197
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something my friends got me.

2092
02:20:24,821 --> 02:20:25,682
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2093
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Something different.

2094
02:20:52,020 --> 02:20:54,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I want everyone's opinion in the studio about this.

2095
02:20:55,101 --> 02:21:00,642
[SPEAKER_12]: As some of you know, I go to cons and I sell hentai video games.

2096
02:21:01,102 --> 02:21:09,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, we're thinking about changing the packaging design to make it look more like normal Wii, PS2, PS3 boxes.

2097
02:21:09,683 --> 02:21:18,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I had said that I don't think that's a very good idea because we'd have to deal with the ESRB who would want the games rated and it would just go into a...

2098
02:21:19,881 --> 02:21:20,902
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2099
02:21:43,857 --> 02:21:46,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you redistributing them from another person, or what is this?

2100
02:21:46,179 --> 02:21:48,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know you wrote games, or what the hell is this?

2101
02:21:48,780 --> 02:21:50,941
[SPEAKER_10]: We've redistributed them from a company called J-List.

2102
02:21:51,322 --> 02:21:52,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay, cool.

2103
02:21:52,102 --> 02:21:52,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I know J-List.

2104
02:21:52,842 --> 02:21:54,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ordered lots of snacks from them.

2105
02:21:55,244 --> 02:21:58,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're okay designing box art that's similar.

2106
02:21:59,306 --> 02:22:03,228
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, honestly, if you want good examples of parody, go to the porn industry.

2107
02:22:03,608 --> 02:22:05,930
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of what you're going to have to do for these games.

2108
02:22:06,030 --> 02:22:07,331
[SPEAKER_11]: You know... Hey, wait, hold on.

2109
02:22:07,511 --> 02:22:07,691
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2110
02:22:09,132 --> 02:22:10,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Random porno fact here.

2111
02:22:10,955 --> 02:22:14,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you remember that Not the Brady's thing that they had?

2112
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:16,563
[SPEAKER_11]: They have Not the Munsters now.

2113
02:22:17,644 --> 02:22:19,006
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a porno Munsters movie.

2114
02:22:19,026 --> 02:22:20,768
[SPEAKER_10]: We have in our house Not Another Porn Movie.

2115
02:22:21,778 --> 02:22:22,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's what we do now.

2116
02:22:49,062 --> 02:23:05,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so why not design, yeah, you could design something, come up with something unique, but you could certainly do something that's consistent across the hentai land so that, you know, when you see the purple border on the top of a certain shape or whatever, you know you're getting quality J-list hentai.

2117
02:23:05,648 --> 02:23:08,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, why exactly are you redesigning the packaging in the first place?

2118
02:23:09,508 --> 02:23:11,690
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2119
02:23:30,632 --> 02:23:36,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Design something consistent, like a purple bar along the top that's in a pixely art or something.

2120
02:23:36,714 --> 02:23:40,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have a name for the series?

2121
02:23:41,835 --> 02:23:43,416
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they're different hentai titles.

2122
02:23:43,436 --> 02:23:44,396
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just it.

2123
02:23:44,416 --> 02:23:45,917
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the name of a hentai title?

2124
02:23:46,637 --> 02:23:50,038
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them is Almar's Professor Cherry.

2125
02:23:50,058 --> 02:23:51,578
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the games that we sell.

2126
02:23:51,918 --> 02:23:57,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Sexy Professor Series or something like that along the top in a pixely type art that makes me think of video games.

2127
02:24:00,137 --> 02:24:07,921
[SPEAKER_12]: That could work, but I'm just more worried about the fact that expanding that the ESRB may be like, hey, you're selling PC games without our rating.

2128
02:24:08,721 --> 02:24:10,642
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want to deal with that.

2129
02:24:10,742 --> 02:24:11,583
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't put their rating on it.

2130
02:24:11,603 --> 02:24:12,703
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not making the games.

2131
02:24:12,723 --> 02:24:13,664
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't give a shit.

2132
02:24:13,684 --> 02:24:14,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're not big enough.

2133
02:24:14,925 --> 02:24:15,845
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not going to notice.

2134
02:24:16,145 --> 02:24:17,546
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I said.

2135
02:24:17,726 --> 02:24:22,949
[SPEAKER_10]: As long as it's very clear on the box, not for children, you'll be fine.

2136
02:24:24,089 --> 02:24:26,151
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta have it somewhere on the box, very clear.

2137
02:24:26,611 --> 02:24:27,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Not for children.

2138
02:24:28,032 --> 02:24:32,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if the box art is like a dick going in a pussy, I think that's gonna get the message across.

2139
02:24:32,955 --> 02:24:34,156
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, that's on the inside.

2140
02:24:34,176 --> 02:24:35,617
[SPEAKER_10]: The actual DVD.

2141
02:24:36,397 --> 02:24:38,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the fronts rather artistic?

2142
02:24:39,539 --> 02:24:40,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they very artistic.

2143
02:24:42,581 --> 02:24:43,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait a minute.

2144
02:24:43,582 --> 02:24:45,323
[SPEAKER_10]: We should get some of these games.

2145
02:24:45,343 --> 02:24:49,325
[SPEAKER_11]: What they need to do is have embossed packaging, especially around the boobular area.

2146
02:24:49,345 --> 02:24:49,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2147
02:24:49,966 --> 02:24:50,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2148
02:24:51,405 --> 02:24:53,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll tell you guys what.

2149
02:24:53,286 --> 02:24:56,329
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have some open copies I can send you guys in Sky.

2150
02:24:56,449 --> 02:24:58,050
[SPEAKER_12]: I have some Yaoi titles for you.

2151
02:24:58,070 --> 02:24:58,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Sweet!

2152
02:24:58,390 --> 02:24:58,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes!

2153
02:25:00,352 --> 02:25:02,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Look who's really excited about the Yaoi titles.

2154
02:25:02,233 --> 02:25:02,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you hear that?

2155
02:25:03,033 --> 02:25:04,755
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's actually a couple I almost bought.

2156
02:25:05,815 --> 02:25:06,176
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2157
02:25:06,476 --> 02:25:08,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Again... I'll review them for the show.

2158
02:25:08,357 --> 02:25:09,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, here's my advice.

2159
02:25:09,518 --> 02:25:10,959
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do the DVD packaging.

2160
02:25:11,199 --> 02:25:13,241
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on a small enough scale I don't think they're going to care.

2161
02:25:13,641 --> 02:25:16,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't flat out copy what the big boys are doing.

2162
02:25:16,603 --> 02:25:18,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Come up with something similar.

2163
02:25:18,364 --> 02:25:18,865
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing like that.

2164
02:25:19,045 --> 02:25:19,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2165
02:25:19,585 --> 02:25:19,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2166
02:25:20,586 --> 02:25:20,966
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2167
02:25:21,067 --> 02:25:24,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the chat room wants to see some of this art.

2168
02:25:45,530 --> 02:25:46,210
[SPEAKER_12]: No!

2169
02:25:46,290 --> 02:25:49,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, they're not going to want to carry it, but you might be able to get it in indie game stores.

2170
02:25:49,552 --> 02:25:50,533
[SPEAKER_10]: You never know, with back rooms.

2171
02:25:50,853 --> 02:25:52,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, here's my thought, though.

2172
02:25:52,234 --> 02:26:08,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I know this is going to sound crazy, but go back in gaming's history and look at some of the box art that came out for games like Custer's Revenge, or even on the completely opposite end of the spectrum, go look at some of the box art for Bible Adventures and some of those games that came out on the NES, because those games were unauthorized, correct?

2173
02:26:08,682 --> 02:26:09,983
[SPEAKER_10]: They were not official Nintendo products.

2174
02:26:10,643 --> 02:26:10,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

2175
02:26:11,264 --> 02:26:13,845
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the Color Dreams games, you might find some inspiration.

2176
02:26:16,547 --> 02:26:18,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well Ranma, we gotta let you go though, but good luck with the business.

2177
02:26:18,887 --> 02:26:20,588
[SPEAKER_10]: You're doing a great thing for the community.

2178
02:26:21,408 --> 02:26:22,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we definitely do.

2179
02:26:22,688 --> 02:26:27,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and Rob, before I go, I know you and Jamie like Rumble Roses.

2180
02:26:27,769 --> 02:26:30,390
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a porn version of that available.

2181
02:26:31,230 --> 02:26:32,650
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called Ready to Rumble.

2182
02:26:32,750 --> 02:26:34,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a hentai podcast?

2183
02:26:35,911 --> 02:26:36,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

2184
02:26:36,991 --> 02:26:38,872
[SPEAKER_12]: I know my podcast gets a little bit hentai-ish.

2185
02:26:38,892 --> 02:26:39,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Check the chat room.

2186
02:26:41,951 --> 02:26:42,231
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2187
02:26:42,271 --> 02:26:42,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there is one.

2188
02:26:43,032 --> 02:26:47,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if this guy listens anymore, but I remember way, way, way back in the day when we first, first started podcasting.

2189
02:26:47,353 --> 02:26:48,634
[SPEAKER_10]: We were doing the to-go stuff, right?

2190
02:26:49,034 --> 02:26:52,755
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a guy who ended up starting a hentai podcast because we got referrals from his site.

2191
02:26:53,075 --> 02:26:53,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember that.

2192
02:26:54,236 --> 02:27:01,638
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's at least a hentai podcast, but a hentai gaming podcast, that might be a niche that needs to be discovered, my friend.

2193
02:27:03,099 --> 02:27:05,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I might have to start reviewing them on my own podcast then, huh?

2194
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:06,240
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2195
02:27:06,260 --> 02:27:06,640
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2196
02:27:07,854 --> 02:27:14,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we gotta let you go Ranma, have a good one buddy Thanks a lot, y'all have a good one You're a true American You know the company that made Custer's Revenge?

2197
02:27:14,459 --> 02:27:14,880
[SPEAKER_10]: What, who?

2198
02:27:15,260 --> 02:27:18,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a friend named Mystique Oh, Mystique Entertainment?

2199
02:27:18,363 --> 02:27:20,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah I met Mystique, right?

2200
02:27:20,404 --> 02:27:31,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Amazonian girl Yes, she was nice Yeah, she is, she's great She's fun But the box is so funny It is very funny See, but it's shaped like a normal Atari box Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

2201
02:27:32,974 --> 02:27:36,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi folks, this is a standing neighbor I'm sorry, what was your name again?

2202
02:27:37,921 --> 02:27:38,922
[SPEAKER_01]: and Spazinator.

2203
02:27:39,442 --> 02:27:40,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Spazinator!

2204
02:27:40,242 --> 02:27:41,483
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, Spazinator?

2205
02:27:42,964 --> 02:27:43,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

2206
02:27:43,865 --> 02:27:50,069
[SPEAKER_01]: There was two questions I neglected to put into my email that I just thought of.

2207
02:27:51,229 --> 02:28:05,418
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, considering that Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting and Samurai Shodown 2 are both available for Xbox Live Arcade, do you suppose there's any chance that

2208
02:28:06,024 --> 02:28:17,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Samurai Shodown 4 Avacoustas will eventually come out for Xbox Live Arcade or no?

2209
02:28:17,370 --> 02:28:19,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Where there is money to be made, they will make it.

2210
02:28:19,731 --> 02:28:22,252
[SPEAKER_10]: But aren't they doing the Super Street Fighter 2 High Def thing?

2211
02:28:22,332 --> 02:28:25,234
[SPEAKER_10]: That is coming out on Xbox Live, the Super Street Fighter 2 High Def Remix.

2212
02:28:25,534 --> 02:28:26,094
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing that.

2213
02:28:27,075 --> 02:28:28,936
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know about Samurai Shodown 4 so much, though.

2214
02:28:28,956 --> 02:28:30,296
[SPEAKER_10]: It really depends on how the other one sells.

2215
02:28:30,577 --> 02:28:31,077
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.

2216
02:28:32,392 --> 02:29:00,907
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah well honestly if you ask me I think that at least with the samurai showdown series the fourth game is probably the best in the series if you ask me but that's just one person's opinion but you know what else is selling though are those compilations and you never know one of those is probably going to come out at some point for xbox 360 because they have them on playstation 2 why not there's people that buy that stuff like candy so you know even if it doesn't show up on arcade you'll probably see it in a compilation down the line

2217
02:29:04,533 --> 02:29:05,254
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the other question?

2218
02:29:06,934 --> 02:29:28,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, considering that sometime next year in the United States to come out with the DSi, these polls that for someone that only got the DS Lite within the past few months and really only got it for certain third-party games like

2219
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:33,293
[SPEAKER_01]: The Final Fantasy Remakes, The Genealogy Wars and what not.

2220
02:29:33,313 --> 02:29:42,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you suppose there's any good reason for someone to upgrade to the DSi or should we just stick to the DS Lite?

2221
02:29:44,451 --> 02:29:45,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is interesting.

2222
02:29:45,532 --> 02:29:55,516
[SPEAKER_10]: Systems like the DSi are kind of starting to blur the line of our golden rule of gaming, and we've said this a million times on the show, but the golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

2223
02:29:56,177 --> 02:30:02,840
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there are games that are going to take advantage of the DSi's features that you absolutely have to have the DSi for...

2224
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:04,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

2225
02:30:24,608 --> 02:30:25,610
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2226
02:30:39,810 --> 02:30:40,431
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

2227
02:30:55,531 --> 02:30:57,512
[SPEAKER_10]: or do I already have what I really want on my iPhone?

2228
02:30:57,932 --> 02:31:01,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we know enough about the system yet to really answer these questions.

2229
02:31:01,313 --> 02:31:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's definitely the oohs and ahs factors going on there, but the problem is the camera, we've seen it before.

2230
02:31:08,215 --> 02:31:10,476
[SPEAKER_10]: The downloadable content, we've seen it before.

2231
02:31:10,956 --> 02:31:14,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything they're putting into the DSi, we've seen before, we just haven't seen Nintendo do it.

2232
02:31:15,138 --> 02:31:19,439
[SPEAKER_10]: So the question is, how is Nintendo going to do this and make it their own?

2233
02:31:19,699 --> 02:31:21,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's really what has to be demonstrated.

2234
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:23,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody have anything else they want to add to that?

2235
02:31:23,701 --> 02:31:24,701
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2236
02:31:24,929 --> 02:31:32,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not to go poo-pooing on Nintendo or anything, but... Oh, why not?

2237
02:31:32,256 --> 02:31:33,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I was poo-pooing on them earlier.

2238
02:31:33,397 --> 02:31:46,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of got away from Nintendo over the past 10 years, simply because, at least with the F64, they have had not too great of a game lineup.

2239
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:50,053
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a handful of games, but...

2240
02:31:51,441 --> 02:31:54,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not overly great.

2241
02:31:54,344 --> 02:32:01,591
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes with the GameCube and even to a certain extent, even the Wii.

2242
02:32:02,372 --> 02:32:09,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, the Wii is good for like the retro games and whatnot, but aside from that, I don't think it's useful.

2243
02:32:10,404 --> 02:32:11,465
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2244
02:32:36,998 --> 02:32:40,861
[SPEAKER_10]: We're probably like a year or two away from hearing something like that, and it's going to be the same question.

2245
02:32:40,901 --> 02:32:45,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I really need to get one the first day, or does that game I have to have, is that a ways out?

2246
02:32:46,766 --> 02:32:47,046
[SPEAKER_10]: You know?

2247
02:32:47,287 --> 02:33:04,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ironically, I think I heard either on Tech of the Show or X-Play within the past couple days that Nintendo's actually, you know, has formally announced or leaked some information about, you know,

2248
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:08,631
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like a Wii 2 or Wii HD.

2249
02:33:08,811 --> 02:33:10,032
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a dork.

2250
02:33:10,172 --> 02:33:13,053
[SPEAKER_11]: It was some dude that quit EGM and 1UP or whatever.

2251
02:33:13,093 --> 02:33:15,033
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a former editor that made that comment.

2252
02:33:15,073 --> 02:33:18,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And to be honest, that type of rumor shows up every six months.

2253
02:33:18,315 --> 02:33:19,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, let's face reality.

2254
02:33:20,255 --> 02:33:22,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Will Nintendo make another video game system?

2255
02:33:22,936 --> 02:33:23,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck yes, they will.

2256
02:33:24,117 --> 02:33:25,717
[SPEAKER_10]: They've done extremely well with Wii.

2257
02:33:26,097 --> 02:33:27,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they're going to make another video game system.

2258
02:33:28,298 --> 02:33:30,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Will Nintendo make the system backwards compatible?

2259
02:33:31,059 --> 02:33:31,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, they will.

2260
02:33:31,859 --> 02:33:35,621
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a big selling point of the Wii was the fact that they had all the GameCube games available.

2261
02:33:35,981 --> 02:33:40,844
[SPEAKER_10]: So the fact that there will be another video game system from Nintendo is not news.

2262
02:33:41,244 --> 02:33:41,944
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really not.

2263
02:33:42,485 --> 02:33:51,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know why all these... There will be another, whether they call it Wii or Wii 2 or, you know, Turkey Butt.

2264
02:33:51,369 --> 02:33:52,849
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter what they call it.

2265
02:33:53,010 --> 02:33:53,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I vote Turkey Butt.

2266
02:33:55,231 --> 02:33:58,572
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some new Nintendo system.

2267
02:33:58,712 --> 02:34:00,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Turkey Butt, the game system.

2268
02:34:01,273 --> 02:34:02,834
[SPEAKER_10]: But hey, we all laughed at Wii.

2269
02:34:05,055 --> 02:34:07,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, there's a new Mario game coming out on Turkey Butt.

2270
02:34:10,939 --> 02:34:11,319
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2271
02:34:11,379 --> 02:34:16,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I still give Nintendo a whole lot of crap about Wii.

2272
02:34:16,882 --> 02:34:25,967
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you're telling someone they're about to use the restroom or you're trying to speak French or something.

2273
02:34:26,527 --> 02:34:27,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe both, I don't know.

2274
02:34:29,034 --> 02:34:29,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

2275
02:34:29,654 --> 02:34:32,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Spazinator, good luck in your quest for the DSi.

2276
02:34:32,936 --> 02:34:33,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2277
02:34:33,476 --> 02:34:34,577
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to decide right now.

2278
02:34:34,597 --> 02:34:35,877
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not getting it for a year anyway.

2279
02:34:36,078 --> 02:34:42,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I would not import them unless, like, I had no digital camera or, you know, I don't know.

2280
02:34:42,020 --> 02:34:43,521
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, Loki's really big on the whole.

2281
02:34:43,601 --> 02:34:46,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to exploit that SD card best I can, so maybe I can see that angle too.

2282
02:34:47,083 --> 02:34:48,103
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm lazy too.

2283
02:34:48,123 --> 02:34:49,624
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a lot of time to decide this.

2284
02:34:49,904 --> 02:34:50,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So good luck to you.

2285
02:34:50,965 --> 02:34:53,286
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll keep bringing you the updates so I know what games are going to release.

2286
02:34:53,546 --> 02:34:54,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So take care, buddy.

2287
02:34:55,967 --> 02:34:56,247
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2288
02:34:56,267 --> 02:34:56,447
[SPEAKER_10]: You too.

2289
02:34:56,467 --> 02:34:56,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for the call.

2290
02:34:57,028 --> 02:34:57,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

2291
02:34:58,322 --> 02:35:02,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's take another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2292
02:35:03,314 --> 02:35:06,723
[SPEAKER_10]: This will be the one and only Dark Knight Hey Dark Knight, what's on your mind, my friend?

2293
02:35:06,743 --> 02:35:06,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello

2294
02:35:08,021 --> 02:35:14,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about the DSi thing, talking about the innovation, and I remember you made a mistake earlier calling the DSi phone.

2295
02:35:14,626 --> 02:35:18,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it probably end up being the next thing they'll probably do down the line.

2296
02:35:18,108 --> 02:35:20,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's just a matter of time.

2297
02:35:21,090 --> 02:35:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Tons of fucking people own a DS.

2298
02:35:23,392 --> 02:35:24,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, really.

2299
02:35:24,553 --> 02:35:29,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I remember back in the day you were kind of a nerd if you had the old school Game Boy brick or whatever.

2300
02:35:29,596 --> 02:35:30,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Very few people had those.

2301
02:35:30,937 --> 02:35:31,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

2302
02:35:31,337 --> 02:35:32,258
[SPEAKER_05]: The God Matrix one.

2303
02:35:32,618 --> 02:35:40,045
[SPEAKER_10]: We were sitting in a plane coming back from Penny Arcade Expo and I looked across the aisle and there was an old lady with gray hair playing her DS.

2304
02:35:40,345 --> 02:35:46,191
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that shows you just what a long way gaming has come in handheld gaming in so many years.

2305
02:35:46,831 --> 02:35:49,294
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny though when you think about it though.

2306
02:35:50,509 --> 02:35:58,614
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and really a more appropriate pun would be a DSi Touch is really what this thing is kind of to me because it's going to have like little calendars and all sorts of things.

2307
02:35:58,994 --> 02:35:59,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know what?

2308
02:35:59,695 --> 02:36:00,755
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be kind of cool.

2309
02:36:00,835 --> 02:36:06,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I'm going to get one, but it's just I joke because it's kind of like, well, I feel like we've kind of seen this all before.

2310
02:36:06,719 --> 02:36:09,321
[SPEAKER_10]: How is Nintendo going to make this special?

2311
02:36:11,198 --> 02:36:14,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we go through the history list of the Game Boy again like I did the previous night?

2312
02:36:16,963 --> 02:36:19,406
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so many sad things they did to it and whatnot.

2313
02:36:19,466 --> 02:36:26,032
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go all the way back from the dot matrix Game Boy to Game Boy Color, Game Boy Microphone.

2314
02:36:26,452 --> 02:36:27,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Boy, um...

2315
02:36:45,248 --> 02:36:45,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?

2316
02:36:45,748 --> 02:36:49,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they were showing off the headset and I think they do have the headset.

2317
02:36:49,049 --> 02:36:51,910
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not quite as on board as the PSP is with Skype and everything.

2318
02:36:52,250 --> 02:36:52,970
[SPEAKER_10]: But what do you want to bet?

2319
02:36:53,251 --> 02:36:58,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo could Nintendo-fy the entire way we think about VOIP.

2320
02:36:58,852 --> 02:37:02,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I say that, I mean make it disgustingly simple so that even grandma can use it.

2321
02:37:03,354 --> 02:37:05,174
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they're going to get into the phone industry.

2322
02:37:05,815 --> 02:37:08,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, think about this though.

2323
02:37:09,016 --> 02:37:13,317
[SPEAKER_05]: In the homebrew community, somebody actually already did that a while back.

2324
02:37:14,329 --> 02:37:17,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the grandma on the airplane doesn't know that.

2325
02:37:18,291 --> 02:37:19,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not many people don't know that.

2326
02:37:20,113 --> 02:37:22,434
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one that somebody already made like a little what?

2327
02:37:22,874 --> 02:37:26,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a little V over IP thing in the homebrew community already.

2328
02:37:26,556 --> 02:37:30,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that not many people don't know about it nor have the equipment to do so.

2329
02:37:31,403 --> 02:37:32,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2330
02:37:50,851 --> 02:37:52,293
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be kind of neat.

2331
02:37:52,593 --> 02:37:54,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that would be a killer vibe.

2332
02:37:54,335 --> 02:37:56,438
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of neat, but that will never happen.

2333
02:37:57,299 --> 02:38:02,205
[SPEAKER_10]: As hard of a time as we give Nintendo, they might actually be sitting on Genius.

2334
02:38:02,785 --> 02:38:04,828
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a matter of, will they do it?

2335
02:38:05,882 --> 02:38:07,043
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2336
02:38:23,740 --> 02:38:25,300
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkNight specifically, are you going to get the DSi?

2337
02:38:46,593 --> 02:38:52,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm probably going to pass on it because I'm basically going to be like... I'll wait for it when a graphical change hits the DS.

2338
02:38:52,656 --> 02:38:56,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to... I mean, innovation alone is not really going to wow me this much.

2339
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:59,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still happy with my DS fat.

2340
02:38:59,380 --> 02:39:00,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

2341
02:39:00,321 --> 02:39:03,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, why did we even really need to upgrade to the light in the first place?

2342
02:39:03,443 --> 02:39:06,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I did, so it's hard for me to talk.

2343
02:39:06,905 --> 02:39:09,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I told him, I said... I was telling some people tonight, I said...

2344
02:39:10,569 --> 02:39:13,911
[SPEAKER_05]: If the DS were to have a slight graphical upgrade, I may jump on it.

2345
02:39:13,951 --> 02:39:18,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, the DS, I just basically like niche stuff and whatnot.

2346
02:39:18,434 --> 02:39:20,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need all that niche stuff right now.

2347
02:39:20,235 --> 02:39:20,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't.

2348
02:39:21,036 --> 02:39:23,117
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really worth it.

2349
02:39:23,618 --> 02:39:23,898
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2350
02:39:24,098 --> 02:39:26,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, any other thoughts tonight, Dark Knight, before we let you go?

2351
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:27,500
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to try to get one.

2352
02:39:29,577 --> 02:39:34,259
[SPEAKER_05]: I had so many thoughts, but I left my brain, but I'll be discussing it next week when I do my thing.

2353
02:39:34,919 --> 02:39:36,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, it's all good, Dark Knight.

2354
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:37,300
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a good night, okay?

2355
02:39:37,480 --> 02:39:38,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And thanks for calling.

2356
02:39:38,801 --> 02:39:39,541
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you do the same.

2357
02:39:39,581 --> 02:39:40,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care, guys.

2358
02:39:40,181 --> 02:39:41,042
[SPEAKER_10]: Talk Nintendo with us.

2359
02:39:41,062 --> 02:39:41,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

2360
02:39:43,003 --> 02:39:45,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll take one more call.

2361
02:39:45,103 --> 02:39:50,886
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2362
02:39:51,666 --> 02:39:56,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can talk about Nintendo, or you can talk about Tokyo Game Show, you can talk about SingStar ABBA.

2363
02:39:58,146 --> 02:39:58,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio

2364
02:40:19,551 --> 02:40:25,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically about the ACDC track pack Walmart is going to sell.

2365
02:40:25,937 --> 02:40:26,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2366
02:40:26,738 --> 02:40:35,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking that maybe Harmonix and EA in this case are taking the steps of Activision and...

2367
02:40:36,687 --> 02:40:42,309
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're doing with Guitar Hero, you know, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, and next year, Guitar Hero Metallica.

2368
02:40:42,329 --> 02:40:44,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're going the same steps.

2369
02:40:45,070 --> 02:40:49,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Though, I'm thinking that they are doing the wrong thing with it.

2370
02:40:50,311 --> 02:40:51,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they should have...

2371
02:40:52,712 --> 02:41:11,937
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe release the disc itself but also made it download content and maybe offer it for a cheaper price because $30 for 20 or so songs, for me, I think it's expensive even though it's a new game.

2372
02:41:12,697 --> 02:41:13,377
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2373
02:41:35,330 --> 02:41:38,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at how much I am freaking obsessed over seeing Star ABBA.

2374
02:41:38,592 --> 02:41:41,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Half of it is in jest, but the other half really isn't.

2375
02:41:41,995 --> 02:41:43,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I freaking love ABBA.

2376
02:41:43,335 --> 02:41:45,117
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the best band out of the 70s.

2377
02:41:45,177 --> 02:41:50,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Call me the biggest gay or whatever you want, but I will buy this game because it's awesome.

2378
02:41:50,320 --> 02:41:53,182
[SPEAKER_10]: There are people like that out there for ACDC.

2379
02:41:53,562 --> 02:41:57,825
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is, how much are going to put $40 out there to get this game?

2380
02:41:58,145 --> 02:42:05,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And if this sells even remotely well, the floodgates are going to burst open next year and you are going to see this kind of stuff.

2381
02:42:05,470 --> 02:42:07,472
[SPEAKER_10]: for 10 bands next year.

2382
02:42:08,773 --> 02:42:12,777
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if they can make that much money off of it, this is where music is going.

2383
02:42:13,097 --> 02:42:30,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's why I'm worrying because if it sells, and I know it will sell because there are a lot of ACDC fans, but maybe they could offer the same thing

2384
02:42:31,209 --> 02:42:35,572
[SPEAKER_02]: just on the Xbox Live Marketplace or on the PlayStation Network.

2385
02:42:36,432 --> 02:42:45,177
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made it also downloadable because not everyone is a fan of ACDC, but some of them like their songs.

2386
02:42:47,679 --> 02:42:50,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the same thing you could say with ABBA.

2387
02:42:51,041 --> 02:42:59,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone said on chat earlier, you could make the songs downloadable content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3, but there aren't.

2388
02:43:01,914 --> 02:43:02,694
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2389
02:43:24,645 --> 02:43:33,846
[SPEAKER_10]: with you know monies and shirts and everything these are not the people that want their songs going two dollars a pop i mean they probably want to go all in with this stuff you know what i mean

2390
02:43:36,002 --> 02:43:40,745
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want their song thrown in as an afterthought in the game.

2391
02:43:41,065 --> 02:43:43,626
[SPEAKER_10]: They want an experience built around their band.

2392
02:43:43,686 --> 02:43:45,267
[SPEAKER_10]: You know this is how they're selling it to them.

2393
02:43:45,547 --> 02:43:58,474
[SPEAKER_10]: When they sit down at the table with ABBA, with ACDC, they're sitting there saying, we want to make this game a whole new way to experience your band and your music and the brand you built.

2394
02:43:58,494 --> 02:43:59,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Just feeding the ego.

2395
02:44:01,912 --> 02:44:02,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true.

2396
02:44:03,613 --> 02:44:15,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, I think they could offer the disc for all the fans because I know there are going to be people that are going to buy it just because it's ACDC.

2397
02:44:16,722 --> 02:44:21,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, and even you, you're going to buy the disc because it's up.

2398
02:44:22,065 --> 02:44:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: If they make a Deftones track pack, I know I'm going to buy it because I'm a big Deftones fan.

2399
02:44:27,769 --> 02:44:30,691
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, they could offer

2400
02:44:31,691 --> 02:44:36,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing for a cheaper price, at least.

2401
02:44:36,834 --> 02:44:40,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy the ACDC pack for $30, at least.

2402
02:44:41,536 --> 02:44:45,878
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a separate game.

2403
02:44:46,318 --> 02:44:49,359
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have its own achievements and everything.

2404
02:44:50,660 --> 02:44:51,220
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about this.

2405
02:44:51,420 --> 02:44:52,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what it is.

2406
02:44:53,755 --> 02:44:55,636
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you this is it.

2407
02:44:55,876 --> 02:44:58,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the time of year this game is coming out too.

2408
02:44:58,818 --> 02:45:03,220
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to buy someone download content as a present.

2409
02:45:04,021 --> 02:45:09,864
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're Grandma and you're walking in the aisles of Walmart and you know little Timmy loves ACDC...

2410
02:45:11,258 --> 02:45:13,441
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think you might end up buying him as a present?

2411
02:45:13,481 --> 02:45:15,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you know he loves ACDC, you know he loves Rock Band.

2412
02:45:16,426 --> 02:45:18,168
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a huge factor in this.

2413
02:45:18,228 --> 02:45:19,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't discount that.

2414
02:45:19,470 --> 02:45:27,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Grandma's less likely to pick up the point cards than she is to pick up ACDC Rock Band track pack as a present.

2415
02:45:29,779 --> 02:45:31,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Something to think about.

2416
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:31,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2417
02:45:31,940 --> 02:45:33,601
[SPEAKER_10]: All these are things to consider.

2418
02:45:33,981 --> 02:45:34,761
[SPEAKER_10]: They definitely all are.

2419
02:45:36,342 --> 02:45:42,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Blackwolf wants to point out also the ACDC pack is cheaper as a track pack than it would if it were separate.

2420
02:45:42,745 --> 02:45:44,265
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $30 as a track pack.

2421
02:45:44,645 --> 02:45:48,507
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $35 if each song was available for $2 a pop individually.

2422
02:45:49,567 --> 02:45:52,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, I think they're catering to the impulse buys.

2423
02:45:52,889 --> 02:45:53,429
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they are.

2424
02:45:54,093 --> 02:45:59,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the 360 and the PlayStation 3 version is going to sell for $39.99, so $40 exactly.

2425
02:46:03,338 --> 02:46:19,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a little bit expensive, especially because of people that download songs and maybe have a particular song they like and they would like to play.

2426
02:46:19,930 --> 02:46:24,654
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, they would have to buy the $30 disc and just for one song.

2427
02:46:25,583 --> 02:46:40,889
[SPEAKER_11]: And here's the thing, too, is if you have a friend that, say, likes ECDC and doesn't really necessarily have Rock Band or doesn't really care about dumping the songs onto his hard drive, you could dump them on your own hard drive and then maybe go in half with him for the actual game.

2428
02:46:41,289 --> 02:46:43,590
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think there's enough people that are going to think about that.

2429
02:46:44,770 --> 02:46:52,113
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for your call, and hey, I'll be crossing my fingers for the Deftones game for you, okay?

2430
02:46:53,694 --> 02:46:53,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

2431
02:46:54,134 --> 02:46:54,814
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, take care, buddy.

2432
02:46:56,534 --> 02:46:57,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Quick comments from chat, though.

2433
02:46:57,554 --> 02:46:59,055
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to wrap up for the Skype line tonight.

2434
02:46:59,095 --> 02:47:01,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to those who didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up the show here.

2435
02:47:02,276 --> 02:47:03,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Reading some comments from chat.

2436
02:47:04,196 --> 02:47:04,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this.

2437
02:47:04,876 --> 02:47:07,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Redertainment says, Grandma is not likely to pick up a game anyway.

2438
02:47:08,237 --> 02:47:09,558
[SPEAKER_10]: For herself, no.

2439
02:47:10,238 --> 02:47:17,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But if your grandma does buy ACDC Rock Band for herself, you do have the coolest fucking grandma in the world.

2440
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:21,661
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandmother drove me all over Mobile trying to find Killer Instinct when it came out.

2441
02:47:21,921 --> 02:47:22,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

2442
02:47:23,021 --> 02:47:23,622
[SPEAKER_10]: That is very awesome.

2443
02:47:23,642 --> 02:47:25,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have the coolest grandmother in the world.

2444
02:47:25,362 --> 02:47:30,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, but I think Grandma might buy it for, I don't, you know, I use Grandma loosely, you know what I mean?

2445
02:47:30,185 --> 02:47:34,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, a friend trying to, or a relative trying to buy it for, you know, but you know what I mean?

2446
02:47:34,808 --> 02:47:36,129
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have the coolest grandmother in the world.

2447
02:47:36,149 --> 02:47:41,313
[SPEAKER_11]: And nobody said that it wasn't exclusive, you know, permanently for Walmart.

2448
02:47:41,813 --> 02:47:47,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, seriously, I have a feeling that maybe it will come out as download content later on.

2449
02:47:47,997 --> 02:47:48,497
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

2450
02:47:49,298 --> 02:47:50,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Wherever they can sell it, they will.

2451
02:47:52,209 --> 02:47:55,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Grandma is person buying a game for other people, says Seg.

2452
02:47:55,191 --> 02:47:57,192
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the point.

2453
02:47:57,312 --> 02:47:57,692
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.

2454
02:47:58,733 --> 02:47:59,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, that's it.

2455
02:47:59,794 --> 02:48:00,534
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to wrap up.

2456
02:48:01,154 --> 02:48:01,815
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another show.

2457
02:48:01,855 --> 02:48:02,295
[SPEAKER_10]: We're done.

2458
02:48:02,355 --> 02:48:03,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We're out of here.

2459
02:48:03,075 --> 02:48:05,617
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2460
02:48:06,117 --> 02:48:08,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will start off with Loki, your final thought tonight.

2461
02:48:09,139 --> 02:48:14,802
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is I have a game that I'm going to be playing a lot of and you'll see some of that very soon.

2462
02:48:15,303 --> 02:48:15,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2463
02:48:15,803 --> 02:48:17,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I never ask for any last minute stories.

2464
02:48:17,304 --> 02:48:18,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a last minute story.

2465
02:48:18,484 --> 02:48:19,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, some quick headlines.

2466
02:48:19,645 --> 02:48:19,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

2467
02:48:20,546 --> 02:48:20,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura.

2468
02:48:21,970 --> 02:48:41,404
[SPEAKER_04]: for anyone who actually is interested in playing on the international Ragnarok Online server they have a free server up it's called Valkyrie and you've got a couple of detriments to playing on it but really it's good if you want to get into the official Ragnarok Online community and I'll link a page in the chat room alright, very cool

2469
02:48:42,942 --> 02:48:46,545
[SPEAKER_11]: PopCap is releasing Bejeweled Twist in October.

2470
02:48:46,625 --> 02:48:48,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I told my wife and she didn't give a shit.

2471
02:48:48,907 --> 02:48:50,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently she's over Bejeweled now.

2472
02:48:50,628 --> 02:48:50,968
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2473
02:48:51,508 --> 02:48:51,989
[SPEAKER_11]: It's weird.

2474
02:48:52,449 --> 02:48:54,591
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's supposed to add some new features to it.

2475
02:48:54,931 --> 02:48:58,373
[SPEAKER_11]: No word on what those features are yet, but something that has to do with probably twisting, I'm guessing.

2476
02:48:59,995 --> 02:49:11,203
[SPEAKER_11]: The PSP 5.0 firmware is out there in testing phase right now, and it is going to add the Wi-Fi store and also allow you to do screen captures.

2477
02:49:11,863 --> 02:49:17,673
[SPEAKER_11]: which are currently available in the not so official homebrew firmwares right now.

2478
02:49:18,774 --> 02:49:26,026
[SPEAKER_11]: And no word on when that's going to be coming, but hopefully, probably sometime in October.

2479
02:49:27,784 --> 02:49:36,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, it's rumored that Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood is becoming Rock Band download content on October 14th.

2480
02:49:36,466 --> 02:49:44,367
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually comes from a post on iMeme.com where they are doing a giveaway of Motley Crue's albums.

2481
02:49:44,547 --> 02:49:49,728
[SPEAKER_11]: They also mentioned that Dr. Feelgood will be coming as download content on Rock Band starting October 24th.

2482
02:49:54,835 --> 02:49:55,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Taiko no Tachigen

2483
02:50:14,386 --> 02:50:15,566
[SPEAKER_11]: or 7,980 yen.

2484
02:50:16,306 --> 02:50:21,388
[SPEAKER_11]: And the drums also can be purchased separately for 3,990 yen or approximately $38.

2485
02:50:21,788 --> 02:50:26,709
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course the game will be out in Japan on the Wii December 12th.

2486
02:50:27,950 --> 02:50:28,370
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of neat.

2487
02:50:30,859 --> 02:50:37,065
[SPEAKER_10]: So since I kind of derailed your other thought, do you now have a final thought now that we've gotten all the last-minute stories taken care of?

2488
02:50:37,225 --> 02:50:37,365
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2489
02:50:37,946 --> 02:50:38,246
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2490
02:50:39,367 --> 02:50:44,232
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is I hear they're opening a Pinkberry in the Bay Area, and I want to go because it's good.

2491
02:50:45,233 --> 02:50:46,153
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2492
02:50:52,019 --> 02:50:52,379
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2493
02:50:53,701 --> 02:50:55,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, knock it off.

2494
02:50:55,722 --> 02:50:55,963
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2495
02:50:56,812 --> 02:50:58,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2496
02:51:24,590 --> 02:51:35,290
[SPEAKER_10]: and it helps spread the word because the more 5 star reviews we get the higher we get in the rankings so please leave us some more nice reviews on iTunes you guys are awesome for that and one other quick thing before we head out tonight

2497
02:51:36,147 --> 02:51:38,048
[SPEAKER_10]: One other very, very quick thing before we head out tonight.

2498
02:51:38,868 --> 02:51:45,410
[SPEAKER_10]: As I understand it, two of OLR's listeners, Deke Mann and Kiki Nico, I don't know if you know, but last year they had a baby.

2499
02:51:46,330 --> 02:51:48,811
[SPEAKER_10]: One year ago, they had a baby, Kylie.

2500
02:51:49,211 --> 02:51:52,892
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kylie is turning one year old this week.

2501
02:51:53,272 --> 02:51:56,913
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to say happy birthday to Kylie on baby's first birthday.

2502
02:51:56,953 --> 02:52:01,455
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was going to say, because I don't have any, I'm not going to sing happy birthday because I don't sing.

2503
02:52:01,775 --> 02:52:02,755
[SPEAKER_10]: I will give you a little bit of this.

2504
02:52:09,991 --> 02:52:11,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday to baby Kylie.

2505
02:52:12,732 --> 02:52:14,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And also happy birthday to Kylie Minogue whenever her birthday is.

2506
02:52:14,933 --> 02:52:16,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I had one last story.

2507
02:52:16,434 --> 02:52:17,374
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the show's over.

2508
02:52:17,414 --> 02:52:18,275
[SPEAKER_09]: No, one more.

2509
02:52:19,035 --> 02:52:19,735
[SPEAKER_11]: This is kind of cool.

2510
02:52:19,775 --> 02:52:20,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2511
02:52:20,176 --> 02:52:20,436
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2512
02:52:20,456 --> 02:52:23,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Bungie's bringing out a video renderer soon to Halo 3.

2513
02:52:24,298 --> 02:52:35,803
[SPEAKER_11]: So they'll actually have an option for those who subscribe to the Bungie Pro where you'll be able to actually export videos made in Halo to Windows Media Format.

2514
02:52:36,584 --> 02:52:38,545
[SPEAKER_10]: for whatever you may want to use that for.

2515
02:52:39,106 --> 02:52:40,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that is kind of cool.

2516
02:52:40,427 --> 02:52:40,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2517
02:52:40,967 --> 02:52:44,849
[SPEAKER_10]: But not nearly as awesome as Kylo Minogue.

2518
02:52:45,070 --> 02:52:48,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you everybody for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

2519
02:52:48,632 --> 02:52:50,593
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see you next time for more wackiness.

2520
02:52:51,094 --> 02:52:54,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully joining us in the studio will be Ball Hair the Dwarf.

2521
02:52:54,396 --> 02:52:54,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Good night.

2522
02:52:55,456 --> 02:52:58,238
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2523
02:52:58,759 --> 02:53:01,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2524
02:53:02,421 --> 02:53:11,048
[SPEAKER_06]: To join us for a live show, visit www.allgames.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific Time.

2525
02:53:11,548 --> 02:53:23,117
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge Radio do not necessarily reflect those of the entire staff of Orange Lounge Radio or AllGames.com, but we're probably right anyway.

2526
02:53:23,737 --> 02:53:24,558
[SPEAKER_06]: See you next week!
