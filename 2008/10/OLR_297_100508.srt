Hi, welcome to an experience called Live Radio, where things screw up sometimes. That's kind of sad.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And it's not user error?

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's complete user error.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, I just loaded the wrong one. That's all that happened. Alright.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How you doing?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm here.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Alright, she's here. She's kicking. She's feisty.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hopefully we'll hear some feisty snark a little later. No, I don't know. I'm just talking you up.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll also say, actually kind of boring tonight in reality.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
See there's feisty. What?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I knew you had it in you.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright, say hello, as well, to the one and only Techmaster, Loki.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How you doing, Loki?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Good.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright, are you feeling feisty tonight?

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Uh, no. I'm starting to get a hang of it.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, I'm sorry. What? Is it something in the air? What you ate?

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's probably allergies or an extra.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's too bad.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's usually the one of the two.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Does that have to do with the seasons changing? Because I'll tell you, like overnight.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,460
I know you're only supposed to talk about the weather when you're bored, but here in the OLR headquarters of Sacramento, California

46
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,800
it's been scorching hot and then last week it starts raining and like the the

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Climate has completely changed

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,620
Allergies have been hitting me a little bit harder lately, but not as hard as they're going to just

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,320
You know cuz they're raining and got dry again and kind of warm again. So you get a lot of mold

50
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,080
You know that means though, right?

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
You get an old ball. No. All right enough weather chat

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's talk about video games

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,680
And of course again join us in our chat room chat that orange on tree calm

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,700
Just taking away to episode number 300 at the end of this month if you can believe it tonight's episode

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,300
297 we're gonna start it off as we always do talking a little bit about our gaming weeks dark soccer

59
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
I'll start off with you. How was your gaming week?

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,520
My gaming week was a lot of Ragnarok as usual addict. Hey

61
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,800
Okay, mr. World of Warcraft. Hey, what was the last time I said on this show? I played World of Warcraft

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
When's the last time you actually did?

63
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
today, okay

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,120
But wait a minute, wait, wait a minute yesterday was the first time in like three weeks, so give me a break

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
I also watched game shows

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
Awesome, namely the VP debate

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,480
Mm-hmm who wants to be a vice president? Yeah, I don't know. I actually I I won't get into it, but I actually was

68
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,000
Moderately disappointed in one party and moderately impressed by the other party even though I thought they both were kind of I will say this

69
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,720
You know

70
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,340
We'd like to keep our eyes on gaming blogs around the internet and the things they're reporting and of course

71
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,120
I'm sure you guys have talked about or I'm sure you guys have heard about Kotaku

72
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,920
They just ran a story that's towards the top of their feet. It looks like it got pushed at five o'clock today

73
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:55,220
Sarah Palin in video games and if you haven't seen this article, I'm gonna link it to you guys here in chat and you know

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,520
Democrat Republican

75
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
Independent I don't care who you are

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,720
You've probably seen the jokes about Sarah Palin and hopefully no matter where you stand

77
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,520
I'm not full of nanomachines. You have a sense of humor about it. Look at this

78
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,920
They'd like put her face on all these different

79
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,800
famous video game shots like there's like Tomb Raider Sarah and

80
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,440
And here's Metroid Sarah is the Metroid one actually looks cool and Cortana. Yeah, actually, they're not bad

81
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,180
The Photoshop jobs are actually pretty good. I got to say my favorite one though is uh, you know that one move every zig

82
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,600
Right there from God. What the hell was the game that game all your base are belong to us zero wings. You're wing. Thank you. Oh

83
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
My god, that's great. Very nice. I

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
like Alaskan Avengers

85
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
So you can check that out

86
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,800
It looks like it's on Kotaku, but I think it originally comes from a site called pwn or die

87
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,400
Something like that. There you have it. Get your politics on. Hey, no matter where you are, though

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Just just vote freaking vote

89
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,440
Play photo the same as one. In fact, I'm feeling politically inspired today because I'm wearing my ECA shirt here

90
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,300
Only the Justin TV folks can see it

91
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,320
I was showing it off earlier

92
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,520
But we have a Justin TV feed that tapes our show even though we're a radio show and not a TV show

93
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,640
So, I don't know why we do it, but the listeners wanted it

94
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,760
So he said all right, if if you want but it's got little controllers on it and it says I got this at PAX

95
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,520
Thanks to Jamie. I'm batting her eyelashes at the ECA booth. It says contrary to popular opinion. These do not make me a killer

96
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,400
How's that because it's supposed to get $5 off because I have my student ID only I didn't have my student ID

97
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,560
And I was like, well crap I could prove I go to school. I have some homework on me

98
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Nice, and so they just gave me another shirt and I paid the full price cool

99
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,800
So Jamie sweet talked her way to my t-shirt. Awesome. All right, so I know how to haggle

100
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,160
What I got some guitar here

101
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm not sure here what played um rock band rock band the first one. Mm-hmm because

102
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,840
We had to have get our Jimmy Buffett on this week

103
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,040
And I'll tell you Jimmy Buffett songs are really great when you're out of your brain on Vicodin

104
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,700
Music in general, uh, you know, where do you think drug culture started?

105
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,280
At probably at a Jimmy Buffett concert, but I have to say there's another video and well not really video

106
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,600
But another game related thing going on. What's that my school life? I'm working on an objects in space

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,560
Project as in basically just stuff, you know hanging out in open space and whatever and I'm doing a pinball machine

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,640
Oh for my art class and my teachers thought it was quite you're gonna take pictures and blog it

109
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,900
Actually, I put it on your Twitter. I'm going to make prints of it

110
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,880
Okay, if it doesn't turn out like utter crap like I feel it will but we still have the space

111
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
I've been too lazy on Justin TV

112
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm pointing to the space where I kept saying I was gonna get the GameStop whiteboard

113
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,320
Things that what was the things that suck about GameStop or something that we were gonna do

114
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,080
And we saw the space so we could have a picture of it

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,040
my husband's told me in no uncertain terms that I have to to have it preserved forever, so I

116
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,320
Figured I'm you know, cuz that's gonna do something for a pinball room. Mm-hmm

117
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,980
So I figured you know, I could do it for the pinball room get a grade for it and maybe people might like it

118
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,120
I don't know. There you go. They just might so alright, so getting a little bit arts

119
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,320
Maybe you could show it in a future video game related art show. Who knows?

120
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,800
I don't think it'd be that good Rob. Oh, you never know. All right, uh Loki. How was your gaming week?

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,400
I game week was alright. I played of course

122
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,080
Saints Row in the first one quite a bit because lives been fucked up

123
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,600
For a few days finally started working again around like Wednesday Thursday

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:39,040
But yeah, we were playing some Saints Row multiplayer because it can do system link and you know couldn't play Grand Theft Auto

125
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Then when it started working played more Grand Theft Auto multiplayer because that game is awesome. I actually went back to play some Earth Defense Force

126
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Uh

127
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,920
2017 and

128
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,040
God that game is still very hard

129
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,000
Still very very very chance of an Earth Defense Force 2018 someday. No

130
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's see, what else did I play? Oh, I also played

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,080
Mercenaries 2 some more did another co-op session with my friend and that was pretty fun

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,640
And then of course, you know the the big one I've been playing this week Saints Row 2. Oh my god. This game is awesome

133
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,520
Seriously if you're gonna compare, you know Saints Row 2

134
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,320
to Grand Theft Auto 4, I think the real thing that kind of stands out is

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,240
This game is a lot more fun. I guess it's

136
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,860
Right from the get-go very over-the-top very

137
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,700
Just fun to play so it's it's can't be fun

138
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,780
It is kind of can't be fun, but like I'm playing right now through one of the gang missions

139
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,980
through the Brotherhood, which is one of the three will technically four gangs in the game and

140
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,180
It just keeps getting more fucked up as you play it. I mean, I don't want to spoil anything but

141
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,460
They kind of are getting back at each other

142
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,900
You know one does something to the other group and you know in return

143
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,540
they retaliate with something even more harsh and

144
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
It's getting nuts

145
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,340
But the game it's got a lot of really good radio stations on the actual, you know vehicles and stuff

146
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,780
They have a lot of good licensed music. In fact, their 80s station is fucking awesome

147
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,060
Did you say something on your Twitter about crashing while you were listening to something?

148
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:25,500
Oh, no

149
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,500
We were we were flying in a biplane buzzing over a freeway shooting at cars while listening to man

150
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,340
or was it land from down under I mean, that's just it's just so crazy and

151
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,300
There's a lot so that catches you off guard. There's a mission that there is a direct

152
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,900
reference to Jack Thompson in

153
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:55,040
Just a lot of really fun stuff and I mean this game is literally maybe forget about Grand Theft Auto 4. It's that good now

154
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,820
First I must say though the graphics in the game. They are a step up from the the first game

155
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,500
The glitches there are still some glitches in this game and some pretty bad ones at times

156
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,860
Like there'll be nothing that really stops the game from working. Just kind of like, huh?

157
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,940
Here's here's Loki playing a Saints Row 2

158
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
Now

159
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,220
Anyways, I've seen the first act deaf says in chat a man six feet down under yeah get it get it

160
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,980
So, yeah going back to the glitch why we have a chat room there was

161
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,900
One time where I had blown up a bunch of stuff during a mayhem mission and when I came back

162
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,020
You know after the mission was done the park benches hadn't respond, but people are still sitting down like there was benches there

163
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,580
There's another one where I was watching a cutscene with

164
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:06,060
Some vehicles or whatever in a caravan and each one of the vehicles in the caravan ran into a telephone pole

165
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,700
That was on the corner because they were it's like the AI is sort of off a little bit like in their past

166
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
It's just like off

167
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,740
Slightly like there'll be another move you can do with a samurai sword

168
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,020
We can literally like stab someone up through their throat, but it's too high

169
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,260
So you're stabbing above them and it just you know reacts the nose

170
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:31,140
No, like above their head it just acts like you're reacting to hitting them, but it's not quite right

171
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,700
And this is a release version. Yes, but here's the thing

172
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,940
It doesn't matter though. It's still early awesome and they have like chainsaw kills just like Gears of War

173
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,100
Which you know it sounds like it's not gonna be graphically the greatest game ever or the sound or whatever

174
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,740
But it's just for you. It's just it's fun. It's big dumb stupid blow shit up fun. It is

175
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,980
It's like blow shit up the game. That's pretty much what it is. That's what you've always something like that

176
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,940
But yeah, it's that's pretty much what if you're looking for game is supposed to be like cutting-edge and stuff

177
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,260
This is probably not it for you

178
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,460
But you know as far as you know the activities in this game are definitely a lot better than Grand Theft Auto

179
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,260
And it's a lot of fun, and the story is actually pretty crazy, so

180
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,700
in fact actually the one of the girlfriends in the

181
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:25,980
Brotherhood kind of looks like that redheaded chick from Final Fantasy 13 that they have in the promo shots lightning so I

182
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,900
Don't know, but we'll us. Hopefully see a little more of this later very nice

183
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,120
Rama says I'm not touching Saints Row 2 until I finish one lol

184
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,340
Yeah, it probably a good thing to finish one because there are I mean

185
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,780
I don't want to spoil anything, but yeah

186
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,460
There's a lot of stuff that ties back actually it's kind of cool about this game is the map itself. It's

187
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,620
Not exactly the same as the first game in fact. It's very different, but there's a lot of parts in here like wow

188
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,580
Hey, I remember that you know like streets and stuff

189
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,900
They're kind of the same, but a lot of it's changed, so it kind of gives you that hey

190
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,540
I've sort of been here before but a lot has changed because you know there's about five years in between the first and second game

191
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,260
a

192
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:11,440
Retertainment in chat says thank God for patches. How is the developer with patches?

193
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,540
Pretty good, I guess I mean last game

194
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,180
They only do one patch on it

195
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,420
So I didn't really fix a lot of glitches in there are still some glitches from the first game that you can do in

196
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,900
This one like for example if you hop on top of a car and you hit the Y button to get in

197
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,100
You'll just instantly teleport into this inside the car. Just like you could in the first game

198
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,560
I don't know. There's a lot of stuff that they've added in they have a new system for

199
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,500
driving that kind of is like burnout a little bit where if you get points for you know oncoming you know

200
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
traffic near misses

201
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Drifting that kind of stuff and you get little

202
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,420
respect bonuses with that and

203
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,180
They have a whole the customization of the characters is just insane

204
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,660
They've added so many different sliders when I literally spent 40 minutes in this game

205
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,580
Setting up my character look like me

206
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,140
So, you know, it's so elaborate with like actually taking pictures of my face and trying to get the proportions, correct?

207
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,060
I don't know. We'll see if it looks correct when we we actually show it off. But uh

208
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,340
They have you can make some really fucked up looking characters in this game though. Seriously, and it's funny because they always comment to you

209
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
They're like, did you do something with your hair?

210
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,180
That's nice on me because you could be a totally different gender nice, but they have three different

211
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,900
voices for male and female you can pick from you can pick your

212
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:42,220
Your stance you they have a taunt and they also have kind of like a a compliment little

213
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,740
gesture you can do they have everything for doing the little jig that uh

214
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
What's-her-name did and

215
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:56,060
To like Michael Jackson's stuff. I have my guy kind of doing that. Hey

216
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,220
And then my my taunt is just you know, flipping someone the bird no, it's funny nice

217
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,900
But yeah, lots lots of customization a really fun game. Seriously. You gotta check it out

218
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,220
All right

219
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,300
I've been playing some new games this week as well

220
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,780
I've been playing the old standbys as well World of Warcraft as I mentioned dark soccer earlier

221
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,340
I just squeezing some more in before the new wrath of Lich King comes out, which by the way

222
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,900
I'm thinking I'm gonna buy at 7-eleven

223
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,220
I was at 7-eleven randomly because I was craving a Slurpee

224
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,180
Like two o'clock in the morning and I actually they have a big old ad there for reserving games

225
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,660
Like wrath of the Lich King and and all these other, you know, like what else was coming out that they were pushing

226
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,060
I

227
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,460
Like, you know other sports games are coming out and all this stuff and I'm thinking who's gonna buy their freaking games at 7-eleven

228
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,300
There's gonna be nobody there the night it launches. So I think that might be where I go to get it. We'll see but also

229
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,880
There's a big big content patch coming to Warcraft on Tuesday and it's gonna change it. It's like the pre

230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,740
Release patch so it's gonna be most of the major changes are hitting not this Tuesday next Tuesday

231
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,320
So I'm trying to squeeze in the last bit of a burning crusade while I can before the patch

232
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,500
Also been playing rock band 2 tons and tons of rock band 2

233
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,220
I'm having that moment where like today I was at Sonic randomly and you know

234
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,140
I was sitting there talking to a friend of mine and then I heard over the speaker

235
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,040
That's what you get done and I'm like, oh, this is a rock band 2 song. I know this song now

236
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,660
It's pretty bad when I'm going out in public and like oh, hey rock band. I'm like thinking in my mind

237
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Okay, strum strum strum strum

238
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,940
anyhow

239
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,420
New games. I've been playing this week Mega Man 9 finally came out on the Xbox 360

240
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,380
So I decided to pick it up because I wasn't gonna get it on the week

241
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,940
So I don't have the space and then on PlayStation 3

242
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,780
I don't even have yet because a little big planets not out and so I probably won't crack until like next week and get a

243
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:45,100
PlayStation 3 now, but I did finally get Mega Man 9 and Xbox 360. It's fun. It's hard. It's retro

244
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,860
It's probably everything you've heard about although I will say this the controls were not as bad as I was expecting

245
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,740
I thought the controls are gonna be horrific on the Xbox 360. It actually isn't that bad

246
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,940
I'm actually able to use the analog controller and still kind of get that old-school Mega Man feeling

247
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,820
Which is very necessary especially for you know

248
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,460
Because you know all the old cliches are in it where you have to have perfect timing to jump from block to block or moving

249
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,780
Platform a moving platform where you're gonna fall in spikes and you know be done for

250
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,980
You know what the game is though. It's not that it's necessarily hard. It's just about learning patterns. It's patterns patterns patterns

251
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,900
That's all the old Mega Man games were too. Except I think the difficulty was toned down in them

252
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
I think what Mega Man 2 was released here in the US

253
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,860
We got like the Japanese easy version or something like that where it was much easier, you know

254
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,320
That's the one most people remember this game, you know, they don't apologize for the difficulty

255
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,320
But it's just about memorizing patterns, you know a splash woman stage

256
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,380
I probably played that like 25 times and died many many times

257
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,580
But now I can get through it without dying because it's just about memorizing where you jump win. That's that's what it is

258
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,600
It's all pattern memorization. That's it

259
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,680
Rama says Mega Man 9 is on the Mega Man 2 engine hard as fuck

260
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,500
They should have packed a vibrator with the game and told you to stick it in your ass and turn it on high

261
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,560
Wow, I don't know about that. I think that's more of a res application actually

262
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,500
So, yeah, I've played it quite a bit

263
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,740
I've probably sank in at least two hours in the game and I've not even beat like four bosses

264
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
I think I've beat three so

265
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
But I'm having fun

266
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:18,260
Also, I've been playing Silent Hill homecoming. I checked out I bought earlier this week and I made a mistake playing Silent Hill homecoming

267
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,460
This week because I'll tell you what

268
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,940
Remember I said earlier in the show when I opened the show it rained for the first time in Sacramento this week

269
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,620
Right for it since February ever. Yeah, I think it was the first time ever

270
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,580
No rain here for like the first time since February. It's been a long time

271
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,780
So we've gotten rain here. So my roommates gone all weekend. He went to Disneyland this weekend the bastard. So he's gone

272
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,980
I'm completely by myself in the house. It's midnight. The winds blowing outside. It's raining and

273
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,820
Suddenly I find myself in Silent Hill

274
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
And

275
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,700
It's just scary, you know, we got the ambient music playing, you know

276
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,180
You're kind of this actually track from Silent Hill 3 not the new game. That's right, you know

277
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:02,320
And I'm just walking around and everything's all dark and scary and I'll tell you what this game

278
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,660
Totally relies on cheap thrills, you know

279
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:11,300
like I'll be walking around and exploring trying to find the other half of the x-ray so I can solve that first little puzzle and

280
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:16,960
Then BAM the wheelchair falls down from the staircase and scares the fucking shit out of me

281
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,420
Because all you have is like a little lot of flashlight, right and then um

282
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,700
God, there's also like a part where you're just like walking through a hall and a fucking body just falls out the ceiling

283
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,420
This game definitely relies on a lot of boo tactics, but it definitely has that ambience as well to it

284
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:40,380
Um, the graphics aren't quite as good as I would have expected for a next generation Silent Hill game

285
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,580
But it's by no means bad. It's probably on par with the last generation of games, but just a widescreen and a little bit crisper

286
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,820
Um tiger class when I saw a pyramid head was I scared and screaming with joy. Here's the thing

287
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,840
I didn't get far enough because that night seriously after the wheelchair found out that fell down the staircase and

288
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,760
My no, I'm not even kidding with you

289
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,460
My front door blew open right after that happened because of the wind and I was like fuck this

290
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,580
I can't play this game right now. So I turned it off. I tried playing a little more

291
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,220
I played for about another 90 minutes the next day and I noticed there was a distinct lack of save points

292
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,300
But I got through the first little area and got to another one

293
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,300
But I haven't gotten to pyramid head yet

294
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,380
Which I you know that tells you I'm not that far in the game at all

295
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,180
So I I can't give a full review to this game because I haven't really seen enough of it

296
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,020
But I definitely can already tell it's it's worthy of being a Silent Hill game. And if you like cheap scares

297
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,660
You'll enjoy it

298
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,740
Henderson man in chat says Silent Hill looks better than that siren crap and I couldn't get into siren. Hmm. I

299
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,780
will say though in the very very beginning of the game is one of those places where it starts to turn from

300
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:51,460
Day to night, you know good Silent Hill dark Silent Hill or whatever you want to call it and that's creepy is very creepy

301
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,740
But it's pretty much the same. It's a cinematic. It's not really something that happens live as is going on

302
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,700
So Henderson man does confirm the save points are few and far between so when you see a save point in Silent Hill

303
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,220
Cherish it. Although from what I understand

304
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,420
The game does kind of autosave as you go so that if you do die

305
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,900
You don't have to go all the way back to your last save point

306
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,300
But if you turn it off you do so there you go. I'm having fun with Silent Hill homecoming

307
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,780
I will play more of it this week

308
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:25,140
Maybe not when I'm home by myself though, because it's a little bit scary a little bit scary. All right, that's our gaming weeks

309
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,340
Let's talk a little bit about housekeeping of which we don't have a whole lot to say except in three weeks is episode number

310
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,940
300 of our show we'll have more details on that when we get a little bit closer to it because we really haven't planned anything yet

311
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,580
also

312
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,680
Don't forget to check us out on our live journal at username orange lounge or our Facebook the ol army just search for ol army

313
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,260
Under groups or our myspace at username orange lounge radio or the Twitter at olr. Yes

314
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,100
That's four different social networking sites and four different names that we have on each of them

315
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,780
We have a real problem with consistency here at our launch radio

316
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,240
All right. Let's get into some gaming news tonight. There's just a

317
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,280
Part a tonight is almost all Nintendo news. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's a little press conference

318
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,660
They had just dominated the news this week tons and tons of Nintendo news. So that's what we're gonna start tonight, right?

319
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:20,260
Loki yes, and of course the big news coming out of Nintendo's press conference was that they're announcing the brand new revision for the DS

320
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
Boy, we didn't see that coming

321
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,960
And apparently the new DS is called a DS. I what makes it different is it's slightly smaller

322
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,080
It is missing the Game Boy Advance slot, but replacing it with a brand new SD memory card slot

323
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,240
Also, the system has two cameras on it a point three megapixel camera

324
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,240
Which will be facing the user kind of in between the two touch or the one touch screen and the other screen there

325
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,100
Also, there is a 1.3 megapixel camera on the outside

326
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,400
the screens are slightly larger now there are three and a quarter inches and

327
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:05,920
And you can also sync your photos with the Wii photo channel and also will include a free web browser application built inside as well

328
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,780
Also, just like the rumor said you can play back your music on there. It will be using AAC

329
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,680
compliant music files, so no mp3s unfortunately and

330
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,460
Is scheduled to ship November 1st in Japan in both black and white and will cost

331
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,780
approximately

332
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,780
178 dollars US or

333
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
189,000 yen and

334
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Yeah, it's kind of cool US

335
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Not getting it for a while

336
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,380
unfortunately

337
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,820
So why because they hate us yes because they hate us

338
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,180
I see and because they say that the DS is selling so well over here

339
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,520
Not anymore now that you announced a brand new version that will be coming out next year stupid

340
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,380
God

341
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,580
but uh

342
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,260
Yeah, and also the other big thing about it is there will be a new DS

343
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,180
I shop where you'll be able to download games kind of like we wear, but you know for the DS and

344
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,500
Some of the games there range from free to about 800 points, so

345
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,940
kind of cool

346
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:19,300
You're obviously the homebrew fan on this show and Tiger Claw and chat says the DS homebrew community are gonna pretty much find ways

347
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,360
To hack the DS I says they can use the SD cards to do all sorts of things. Yes fault

348
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,700
yes, definitely and you know the

349
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,620
The memory card thing will definitely help also the fact that there's cameras built into it

350
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,860
I'm assuming there's gonna be a little bit more RAM built into it as well

351
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,860
it just

352
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,900
It's not gonna be that hard especially since it has to play all the other

353
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,560
DS or the yeah the DS cartridges so at the very least it will

354
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,100
Still work the way the DS does as far as homebrew step goes so does this mean you're gonna kind of want one

355
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,940
Yeah, the thing though that you have to understand though with this one

356
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,220
And I thought that they had onboard storage as well like a little bit of onboard storage

357
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,140
I could be wrong though is that this one will probably be able to receive any some sort of firmware updates

358
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Whereas the other ones weren't I don't know

359
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,500
But what if this didn't have the SD card slot on it?

360
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,060
Would you still be as interested or would it be not interested because there's no way to hack it no

361
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,160
I'd still be interested really. Yeah, you can still hack it. I mean you just

362
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,440
Do it the way you're doing it now is it the camera?

363
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,300
What it what is it you are?

364
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,380
You just want a new system to hack or do you want you like the other features?

365
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:28,740
No

366
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,860
I like the the cameras and I'm interested to see because they're gonna have games that they're releasing for it that are only

367
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,080
Dsi games, so it's not gonna be able to be played on the DS

368
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,860
So I'm kind of wondering what other features they're gonna have on there, or how they're gonna utilize different things

369
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:49,400
I guess we have a lot of time, so we'll get to see, you know, what comes out in Japan first, I guess.

370
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,660
Comments from Chaurum.

371
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Segg says, about the web browser,

372
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,620
it's roundabout free. Each DSI will get 500 Nintendo points, known as Wii points formerly,

373
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,920
which can be used to buy the 500 point opera browser on the DSI.

374
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,500
I heard about that whole 500 free points thing they were supposed to be doing.

375
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,620
Thoughts? I think that the web browser is just free anyways for like,

376
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,220
it's kind of like how it was when it came out over here,

377
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,780
where it's free for a while and now they charge for it.

378
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,900
I like this comment too. I want to read this.

379
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,580
The Rob D in our chat room, chat.orangelandradio.com says,

380
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,760
you can't play your older games, you get a lousy camera, you get an SD slot,

381
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,180
you spend more money, and you get to spend more money in the shop. Yay.

382
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,800
Wait, I have to admit, I kind of agree. I'm not that excited about this little device.

383
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,420
In fact, I've been jokingly call it the DSI phone, because that's pretty much what it is,

384
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,220
but without the phone. It's kind of like an iTouch.

385
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,140
So it's a DSI phone, no, iPod light or touch or whatever?

386
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,260
An iTouch, yeah, DSI touch or whatever you want to call it.

387
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,840
In my mind, that's kind of what they're trying to do with this whole download store thing,

388
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,500
is that it's kind of trying to mirror that applications thing that the iTouch or the iPhone does,

389
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,060
which, you know, I don't think they're trying to copy or anything,

390
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,820
because this thing's probably been in development for a long, long time, but I don't know.

391
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,180
I can't... Here's the thing. I think I'm going to have to get one anyway,

392
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,780
because you know there's going to be that game that comes out at some point

393
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,980
where you have to use the camera that, you know, Nintendo just freaking does this.

394
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,820
There'll be some Mario game I'm going to want to get.

395
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:28,100
If this is as secure as the Wii was with their virtual console and their, you know, WiiWare games,

396
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,340
I don't think we'll have to worry about spending money on the application store.

397
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,980
Well, but hold on though. I mean, you know, come on.

398
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,620
I don't like to do that unless it's usually like import stuff or things you can't get here,

399
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,620
because, you know, I like to support stuff that's good, but, you know...

400
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,980
No, I'm wondering though if they're gonna...

401
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,780
They haven't announced yet anything about the virtual console stuff.

402
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,660
I wonder if some virtual console games will be compatible with this,

403
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,780
because that'd be kind of cool.

404
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,820
That might... You know what?

405
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,700
That alone would actually make me seriously consider getting one,

406
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,660
because that would really justify all those purchases I've been making.

407
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,380
That would be awesome.

408
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:04,180
Yeah, because can you imagine download to your SD memory card slot or whatever for like...

409
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,100
Maybe, you know, stop it at like Super Nintendo games or something like that.

410
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I've gotten to the point where I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo,

411
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,660
because I'm like, well, yeah, that would be cool, but they're not gonna do it.

412
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,100
They're not... Or there'll be some...

413
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,460
There'll be an adapter that you're gonna have to pay 40 bucks for that'll do it.

414
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,420
You know, I'm...

415
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,820
I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo just based on history at this point.

416
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,380
So I don't get excited about these types of things anymore.

417
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,100
It's kind of sad.

418
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,940
Uh, Tigerclaw says, DSI also opens a new can of worms.

419
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,380
People will be sharing very inappropriate photos with each other via PictoChat.

420
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,020
Oh, great.

421
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,580
So if I go into the Penny Arcade Expo room at next year's PAX 09 and DSI or whatever,

422
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,060
am I gonna get cock shots all over my DS from people put...

423
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,460
Or from people putting it down their pants and taking a picture?

424
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,300
Maybe.

425
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,220
Hooray.

426
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:49,380
But...

427
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,980
But...

428
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,220
What?

429
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,100
But what?

430
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,300
I might get boob shots too.

431
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,780
I might.

432
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,300
I wouldn't mind that.

433
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:01,700
All right, uh, if you want to chat on this, uh, chat.orangeonstrategy.com.

434
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,700
Other things that were announced at Nintendo's press conference.

435
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,180
Speaking of SD cards, finally, and you know this has been a big thing for me lately,

436
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,260
I've bitched and bitched and bitched and belly ached and cried and been a big baby

437
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,900
about the fact that I do not believe I should have to remove my games from the Wii

438
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,140
to put them on a card and then bring them back.

439
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,300
You know, this whole, like, slow process.

440
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:25,620
I think they just should address the stupid onboard storage problem on the Wii

441
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,380
and they finally have.

442
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:32,820
You will finally be able to load channels directly from the SD cards in spring of 2009.

443
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,260
The biggest duh in the world.

444
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:37,460
The thing that we knew should have been there the whole freaking time.

445
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,140
Finally, they are installing in spring of 2009.

446
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,780
Why is it taking till spring 2009?

447
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,060
Why can't they do it now?

448
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,540
I mean...

449
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,380
I think they honestly didn't program it in to begin with and there's all the bug...

450
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,420
I think what they're trying to do, they're trying to close up homebrew loops with this too.

451
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,620
I bet you that's what they're trying to do.

452
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,780
When they release this patch, they're going to do their damnedest to stop the exploiting.

453
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,220
They're not going to stop it, but I guess they feel they have an obligation

454
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
to all the people that developed for their system to try.

455
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,940
Good luck with that.

456
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,860
Maybe you should talk to Sony and see how well that went with them and the PSP.

457
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,620
Were they up the home...

458
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,500
Don't you think they owe it to their developers to try?

459
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,380
Yeah, they owe it to their developers to try, but you know...

460
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,180
I don't think it's really hurting them right now as far as it's not allowed...

461
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:28,340
Well, I guess it could allow piracy, but so far the community has been good about keeping that out.

462
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,340
They do have a thing to load ISO's off of the memory cards or whatever,

463
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,860
but it doesn't work really well.

464
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,580
Here's why the update's taken forever.

465
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,700
They don't want you to copy stuff on your SD card,

466
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,940
take it to your friend's house and put it on their Wii.

467
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,780
So they're having to come up with the whole,

468
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,460
how are we going to get around this copy thing?

469
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,820
And the DRM basically, they're implementing DRM.

470
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,900
That's part of the testing that's pushing this thing back.

471
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,660
They already have DRM implemented.

472
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,740
Because if you save...

473
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,380
I guess it's true.

474
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,740
They're Nintendo, it takes them fucking forever to do something.

475
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,460
There, that's it.

476
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,420
We'll just leave it at that.

477
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,500
They're also the masters of making us buy new things.

478
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,620
But guess what?

479
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,380
To be fair, this is a free update.

480
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,300
It's not something that's going to cost us any money,

481
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,860
except for the fact that Nintendo-branded SD cards

482
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,700
are always $10 more than the other ones.

483
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,220
Well, then don't buy them.

484
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,940
I know, don't.

485
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,820
Well, here's the other thing that you're going to have a problem with too,

486
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,740
is they haven't announced that they're going to expand

487
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,100
the number of channels you can have,

488
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,300
so you're still fucked.

489
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,900
You're going to run out of channels eventually.

490
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,860
Well, but maybe that's just kind of a given.

491
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,540
I'm not going to hold that against them yet.

492
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,500
And that is a lot of space.

493
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,780
Or maybe the thing's smart enough to fill in with more channels.

494
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,620
I don't know, has anybody ever filled the damn thing up?

495
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,900
I imagine it's possible.

496
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,260
If you download nothing but Nintendo games.

497
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,740
And what happens?

498
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,620
You just can't put any more?

499
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,260
You can't put any more.

500
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,060
Wow, that sucks.

501
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,140
Huh.

502
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,540
Patch!

503
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,980
All right.

504
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,780
Oh, it might be a part of this patch that you'll add new channels.

505
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,540
I'm not getting negative about that yet.

506
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,260
But we'll see.

507
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,460
More to come in 2009.

508
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,140
Well, as far as other things that are going to be coming out for the Wii,

509
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,420
the Wii Speak channel was unveiled.

510
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:08,020
It actually, Wii Speak is the microphone peripheral

511
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,740
that's coming with Animal Crossing and is getting its own channel.

512
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,980
Um, and that's about all that we know right now.

513
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
That it's just Wii Speak.

514
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,740
So it's going to get its own channel, though,

515
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:23,060
so it's not something you're going to have to use Animal Crossing for.

516
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,940
You can just...

517
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,820
I would assume.

518
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,620
But, you know, there's no true details yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.

519
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,420
I mean, I'm actually thinking that something like that would work for them to do,

520
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,500
like, karaoke games.

521
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,780
Hmm.

522
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,660
Wouldn't that be cool?

523
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,460
That'd be interesting.

524
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,020
Um, or just call your friends.

525
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,540
I mean, seriously.

526
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,340
Well, but, but...

527
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,060
Do you really...

528
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,100
Well, hold on, hold on.

529
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,420
Nintendo...

530
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,060
Long distance costs money, minutes cost money,

531
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,780
that's why VoIP is getting popular.

532
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,340
So I...

533
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,900
Yeah, but most people have, like, you know, pretty decent phone plans.

534
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,660
I mean, hell, people are spending, like, 100 bucks a month on stupid unlimited plans.

535
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,220
Hell, my plan, which is dirt cheap, has unlimited nights and weekends,

536
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,940
and, you know, long distance is included in there.

537
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,780
I mean, seriously, just...

538
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,300
Okay, what if I want to talk to someone at four in the afternoon?

539
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,300
I have a cell phone.

540
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,800
Hmm.

541
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,340
I don't have a landline.

542
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,100
I know, I don't have a landline either.

543
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,580
But myself, I only have so many daytime minutes on my cell.

544
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,180
Maybe I want to talk to people, or maybe...

545
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,820
The one other thing is that, you know, maybe I want to talk to rooms,

546
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,420
like, you know, so we can talk to a party.

547
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:28,980
I text.

548
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,500
I text more than I talk on the phone,

549
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,860
and Dan uses his phone pretty much only people call him or business,

550
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,700
and you get those rollover minutes and there you go.

551
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,100
Um, Sagan Chat says,

552
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,980
WeSpeak will also use friend codes for chatting with friends,

553
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,580
and follows up with, I don't know,

554
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,140
WeSpeak would make a great room phone.

555
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,340
Groups talking to groups.

556
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,140
That's what I'm saying.

557
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,420
Network parties together.

558
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,260
That's going to be its biggest benefit.

559
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,740
But yeah, I think the friend codes for WeSpeak is a given.

560
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,060
I cannot imagine a Nintendo place

561
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,500
where you could go into a room and chat with strangers.

562
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,180
Can you imagine the potential for horrible stories that come with that?

563
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,380
You know what would be cool?

564
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,860
What?

565
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,220
Is doing the next Mario Party game with the voice over IP.

566
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,020
Okay.

567
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,740
So you can, like, talk shit to everybody you're playing with.

568
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,460
Okay, nice.

569
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Call them dirty whores when they get a higher, you know.

570
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,580
That's an awesome idea,

571
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,060
which is why it'll never be implemented ever.

572
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,900
I know, sad.

573
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,220
You have to understand, they come up with these ideas,

574
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,900
they're all, sorry, that's too cool for our console.

575
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,380
You could kind of do that on Xbox Live now,

576
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,620
except you're going to have to settle for Fusion Frenzy 2.

577
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,220
I've put my phone on speaker.

578
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,980
In which case, I think I'd rather chew glass.

579
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:42,020
There's always Vivo Piñata Party, which is slightly better.

580
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,300
So instead of chewing glass, Rob would want to chew plastic.

581
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,980
Mario Party is definitely the top tier, you know what I mean?

582
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,060
All right.

583
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:52,740
Let's move on.

584
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,260
You should make your own party game.

585
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,620
What would an Orange Launch Radio Party game be?

586
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,940
Well, it'd have your weirdo map all over the place.

587
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,380
Get naked and tell your friends.

588
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,340
No, like Mario Party, except you've got, like, weapons.

589
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,180
And, like, you can get a tank, or a Humvee with a rocket launcher on it.

590
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,380
Mortal Kombat Party.

591
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,500
And, and, and, and, and.

592
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,220
What?

593
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,140
Sometimes the dice will have dirty commands on it,

594
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,940
and there'll be lots of guys making out.

595
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,580
Wait, lick, kiss, suck.

596
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,700
You've got the dirty dice part of the game.

597
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,540
Dirty? I don't know.

598
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,460
You have to roll them for guys making out.

599
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:30,820
Okay.

600
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,420
Anyways.

601
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,260
Sadly, I think no one would buy this game.

602
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,940
Yes, exactly.

603
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,620
So, a game that someone might buy.

604
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,060
Pikmin.

605
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:48,100
They're actually doing a brand new series of games called Play on the Wii, or Wii Day Asobu.

606
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,820
And I guess, of course, Pikmin is going to be one of the first games.

607
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,500
Basically what they're doing, it's kind of like what they alluded to before,

608
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,780
like they're, like, kind of a matter of fact stuff when they're talking during E3.

609
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,580
They're just like,

610
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,620
yeah, you know, who's to say that we couldn't take, I don't know, GameCube games and just,

611
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:11,140
I don't know, throw the Wii controls onto them and release them for cheaper?

612
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,260
And didn't everybody say back then,

613
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,660
oh, just you wait, here comes the tidal wave, everything will be re-released.

614
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,540
And, sure enough, here they go, they're re-releasing Pikmin,

615
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:30,420
basically the GameCube version with, you know, fucking Wii controls thrown in there, woohoo.

616
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:37,220
And, yeah, so that'll be the first game that's going to be part of that.

617
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:44,500
But, never fear though, it's not actually the Pikmin game they were talking about before,

618
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,900
which, you know, Miyamoto alluded to.

619
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,780
He is actually making a new Pikmin game, so, you know, this is not, like, you know,

620
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,780
hey, we're going to release a new Zelda game.

621
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,540
Oh, just kidding, it's the old Zelda game.

622
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,900
I'm actually kind of okay with this whole re-releasing of games things,

623
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,300
because you know everybody has that one game that they want out of this.

624
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,180
For me, it's F-Zero, and, you know, maybe there's people that won't win Waker, I don't know.

625
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,260
Isn't there something on GameCube, or what about, like, Metroid Prime 1 and 2?

626
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,540
There's got to be something you want out of this, right, Loki?

627
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,040
Uh, no.

628
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,460
Maybe win Waker, but that's it.

629
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,060
Anyways, the Pikmin game is coming out December 25th in Japan.

630
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:29,060
It's going to be available for 3,800 yen, and that's approximately $36 US.

631
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,060
And, also, some other games that are going to be coming later on.

632
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,900
Nintendo is going to be re-releasing Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, apparently on...

633
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,420
Okay, that doesn't make any sense.

634
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,540
But with the lack of beat.

635
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,540
Yes, I guess before Pikmin, even though this was supposedly the first game,

636
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,580
but Donkey Kong Jungle Beat will be coming out on December 11th in Japan.

637
00:38:52,580 --> 00:39:01,460
Also coming soon will be Chibi-Robo Pikmin 2, Mario Tennis, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2, and...

638
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,820
Of course, of course.

639
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,540
That's it, no word on release dates for the rest of those.

640
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,820
But, um, yeah.

641
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,260
That's kind of cool, I guess.

642
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,740
You know, because the Wii certainly doesn't have enough GameCube ports.

643
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,140
All right.

644
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,820
I'm currently depressed.

645
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,700
While Loki was reading that story, what happened?

646
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,260
I pulled my DS out of my purse because I was looking for something, and the corner broke off.

647
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,980
How did that happen?

648
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,380
I don't know.

649
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
It must have gotten broken in my purse.

650
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,180
That sucks.

651
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,620
I guess I have to get a DSi now.

652
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,580
That's what she does.

653
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,780
No, but she's totally serious.

654
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,580
She was just showing it.

655
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,940
The corners, like, snapped off.

656
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,540
Yeah, I'll put it on the camera.

657
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,620
Is that how you get the husband to buy you new toys?

658
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,900
Aw, Dan, I broke it.

659
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,780
Get toys anyway.

660
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,340
It doesn't matter.

661
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,300
Dan, I broke it.

662
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,020
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,980
I need a new one.

664
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,180
Here, you know, I have a-

665
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,980
No, I can fix this with, um, duct tape and silicone glue.

666
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,580
There ain't nothing duct tape can't fix.

667
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,620
Seriously, just look at it.

668
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,300
I can fix it with silicone glue.

669
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:59,220
If you guys want these games, I mean, why don't you just buy the original GameCube games?

670
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,140
Remember, they do play on the Wii.

671
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,300
But, but, but enhanced Wii controls.

672
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,100
Really?

673
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,220
Widescreen.

674
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:10,420
Have you known, have you known any games that the game, or that the controls actually enhance

675
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,340
the, you know, the playability?

676
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,060
How many times, how many people were, you know, prefer to play on the GameCube controller

677
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,460
for, like, Mario Kart and Smash Brothers?

678
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,220
Is it really enhancing stuff?

679
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm sorry, no.

680
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,700
It's just gonna get people to, I don't know, buy more of their products, and it's an excuse

681
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,420
they're saying, look, we're still releasing first-party products.

682
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Oh, but they are remakes.

683
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,020
What if the games are only 20 bucks?

684
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,180
That's about how much a lot of the GameCube games still cost, like the old Smash Brothers.

685
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,260
If they're 20 bucks, then awesome.

686
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,000
Alright.

687
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,620
Would you consider buying them if they were only 20 bucks?

688
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,120
No.

689
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:51,300
Darkstalker is currently showing off that the DS does still work over on our Justin TV feed,

690
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,180
which you can see at Justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio.

691
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,500
Meanwhile, back to more news about the DSi, and earlier, Loki had mentioned that there's

692
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,020
gonna be a store that's opening up, and that's why I kind of joked that it's the DSi phone,

693
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,860
but it is opening up, and they've already announced what the first few games are gonna

694
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,340
be available on the DSi shop, but guess what?

695
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,620
They are games that you can already get in a traditional card format.

696
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:16,900
Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2, but, but, but retooled.

697
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,820
So that means they're gonna have some extra new feature that's gonna want to make you

698
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,460
buy these games again, and that's what Reggie Fils-Aime announced at the US press event

699
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,140
that is Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2, even though the games have already sold over 10

700
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,340
million units, it just made the most sense to be the kickoffs for the new DSi shop.

701
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,900
See, I'm wondering though when the microtransactions are gonna start, because you know before too

702
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:44,020
long in this DSi shop, it'll be download new games for Brain Age, not like necessarily

703
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:48,980
a full blown Brain Age 3, but like download new brain training sequences as if they were

704
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,420
rock band songs.

705
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,020
You know it's coming, right?

706
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,220
That's why they're doing this.

707
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,660
They want a piece of the microtransaction pie, and the, the Wii wasn't really set up

708
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,100
to handle it very well, even though I guess maybe Rock Band 2 is gonna have it after all,

709
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,060
but still.

710
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:06,980
Why not?

711
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,180
The DS is out there.

712
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,540
Tons and tons of people have one.

713
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,220
It's a hugely popular system.

714
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,820
I have a broken one!

715
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,820
Let's bring microtransactions to it.

716
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,820
Let's get you to buy another DS system.

717
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,620
Maybe Nintendo will sell you some duct tape for 500 Nintendo points.

718
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,860
Because really the DS is just kind of like an upgraded Game Boy Advance, and how many

719
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,780
times did they try to get you to buy the Game Boy?

720
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,560
Yeah.

721
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,360
But, but, but.

722
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,860
Too many.

723
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,200
But, but, but.

724
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,680
I have to get another one now.

725
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,360
And besides, with them releasing a new system, like the DSi, they can release Mario, Super

726
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,960
Mario Brothers DSi, and Mario Kart DSi, and Metroid DSi.

727
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,400
How about CSI DSi?

728
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,900
Rob?

729
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,400
The what?

730
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,200
CSI DSi.

731
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,160
CSI DSi?

732
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:49,800
I like that idea.

733
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,960
Yeah, that would be like a major awesome marketing point.

734
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,760
That would be awesome.

735
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,600
Alright, let's move on.

736
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,320
I'm going to weep.

737
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,280
Why?

738
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,040
I'm weeping inside of my soul.

739
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,320
Why, because you're your DS?

740
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,040
I am.

741
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,560
Can we have a moment of silence, please?

742
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,200
Silence, please.

743
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,720
Excuse me.

744
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,360
Alright, there we go.

745
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,280
The ferret would like to make a statement on behalf of my poor, broken, like me, DS.

746
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,160
And what could that be?

747
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,240
Game news!

748
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,280
Senate Punishment 2!

749
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,680
It's coming on Wii.

750
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,340
That's it.

751
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:29,260
Um, interesting, because Sin and Punishment 1 was never really released in the US.

752
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,460
So that's kind of interesting.

753
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,140
I mean, it was.

754
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,260
We got it on Virtual Console.

755
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,700
Yeah, years later on Virtual Console.

756
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,540
That thing must have sold real well for them to want to bring that out over here.

757
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,860
Because that's an interesting game to dig out of the archives.

758
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,100
It's pretty badass looking, though.

759
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,580
Yeah, is that something you might be interested in picking up?

760
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,060
Yes.

761
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,260
It's looking pretty cool to me.

762
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:52,220
I wanted the first one to come out, although we didn't pick up the Nintendo 64 one online,

763
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,900
but, you know.

764
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,540
You can always maybe get an import one of the real thing.

765
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,140
But they're probably hard to come by at this point.

766
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:58,700
I doubt it.

767
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,260
I've seen them.

768
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,620
I've seen carts.

769
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,220
You can get imported Nintendo 64 carts for not bad.

770
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:05,920
Alright.

771
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,660
Well, hey, if they release a demo or something, or I can play a little bit of it, maybe I'll

772
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:11,980
buy it.

773
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,700
It looks interesting.

774
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,740
Yep, and we need more reasons to buy games.

775
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,820
And Nintendo has now provided us with yet another reason to buy games.

776
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:25,740
And that would be Club Nintendo is finally coming to North America by the end of this

777
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,240
year.

778
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:30,460
And you'll be able to get points with their loyalty program.

779
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:36,540
And by earning points, by purchasing their games, and I guess accessories, I'm not really

780
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,100
sure about that.

781
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:44,700
You will be able to trade those points in for Nito rewards, like different accessories

782
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,540
that are exclusive to the program.

783
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,300
You might remember in Japan they did some of those Game & Watch DS games.

784
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,900
There was a Tingle Balloon Flight game, or Balloon Fight.

785
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,820
There was that weird Power Rangers looking thing.

786
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,620
I don't know.

787
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,540
But yeah, lots of exclusive stuff.

788
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,300
So that's pretty cool.

789
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,740
Hopefully we don't get lame shit on our side, you know?

790
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,300
Because they may have Club Nintendo and it's like, stickers!

791
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,340
Temporary tattoos.

792
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,380
Plastic rings.

793
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,820
Wallpapers, yay.

794
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,180
Mario underwear, yay.

795
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,700
Well, I've registered a lot of old Nintendo games on Nintendo's official site just in

796
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,220
case something like this ever happened.

797
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,900
Am I going to get credit for that?

798
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,780
No, you're not.

799
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,500
I'm not registering anything else until this comes out.

800
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,420
Because I bought Wii Fit this week.

801
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,580
It doesn't matter because there's going to be something different.

802
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,740
There's a different Club Nintendo thing that you're going to have to register, not the

803
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,020
actual games themselves.

804
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,100
But isn't that where the whole...

805
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,820
Well, isn't that what I get the points from?

806
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,580
Yes, but that's going to be something separate.

807
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,540
Well, then why should I continue to register?

808
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,620
Why should you continue to buy anything from them?

809
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,500
That's what I say.

810
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,660
Well, if they put out a good game, I'm going to buy it.

811
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,220
And I wanted Wii Fit anyway, because I'm fat.

812
00:45:58,860 --> 00:45:59,360
So...

813
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:00,780
Rob.

814
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,280
What?

815
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,120
Come here.

816
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:04,320
Stand up.

817
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:05,420
Stand up.

818
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:06,300
Put your microphone down.

819
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,420
Stand up.

820
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:10,940
Come this way, because I'm not getting up.

821
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:13,340
Hold out your hand.

822
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:13,840
Ow!

823
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,940
Now, S-T-F-U.

824
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,740
Whatever, I need to tone.

825
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,180
But you're not fat.

826
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,460
All right, now that I've been...

827
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,140
Chest-ized!

828
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,420
...abused during this program, can we please...

829
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,180
It's not abuse, it's chest-isement.

830
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,180
Can we please move on with gaming news?

831
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,820
Oh, it's me.

832
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,380
Hey.

833
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,180
Yeah, Rob.

834
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,860
All right, well, the game The Conduit.

835
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,780
Lots of people have been looking forward to this, because it's all sci-fi, futuristic

836
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,100
y, first-person, shootery, but hey, it's on the Wii.

837
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:45,980
Apparently...

838
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,300
Here's the weird thing.

839
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,580
The Conduit was announced at the press event that it's going to be an exclusive first-party

840
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,060
shooter.

841
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,500
That's because she's a dumbass.

842
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,940
A lot of people got really excited about it.

843
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,460
Who do we mean by she, Loki?

844
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,140
The dumbass.

845
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:06,380
The one that talks about, you know, snowboarding, her son is so awesome because he makes cards

846
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:06,700
for her...

847
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,580
Cami Dunaway.

848
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:07,980
Cami Dunaway.

849
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,260
Yes, the dumbass.

850
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:09,900
All right.

851
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,660
So, um, here's the thing.

852
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,060
So, apparently, you know, it was called the first-party title, but then, a little later,

853
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,060
apparently, it actually was retracted that, uh, Nintendo is not actually publishing The

854
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,540
Conduit.

855
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:26,060
I knew right away that she was an idiot when she said that.

856
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,060
I'm like, it said, you know, first-party shooter.

857
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,060
I'm like, she meant first-person shooter.

858
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,020
She's just dumb.

859
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:32,860
Whatever.

860
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,820
But really, I wouldn't be surprised if they picked this up, and I think that they should

861
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,940
anyways because, come on, man.

862
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,140
Seriously.

863
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,820
Um, I guess the only concern would be that they're competing with themselves.

864
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,340
Does it really matter?

865
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,020
I mean, is it just, like, the ad dollars and the marketing push that'll come out of it

866
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,060
depending on who picks it up?

867
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,580
You know, who's got the money to sell it?

868
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:53,980
I guess.

869
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,460
The game is, it's not going to change a damn thing about the game itself, right?

870
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,260
No, it's not, but it's just that if there's a publisher, then it means it's coming out

871
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:03,740
sooner.

872
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,940
It's just, you know, that.

873
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,980
And I don't understand why anyone wouldn't publish this game anyways.

874
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,740
There's been so much hype around it, and Nintendo's been pushing it so much anyways, and they

875
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,020
don't have a publisher yet.

876
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,100
I mean, it's kind of retarded to be pushing a game that's not going to be coming out anytime

877
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,220
soon, but whatever.

878
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,460
Well, I don't know.

879
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,420
Loki, this looks like something, and you've talked about this game before.

880
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,540
Is this a, do you care who publishes it, or you can get the game, or what?

881
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,500
No, I don't care.

882
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:30,620
All right.

883
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,700
Well, then let's move on.

884
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,700
Well, then let's move on.

885
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,740
Well, Ian, remember that we talked about the game that even a penguin could play?

886
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,140
And, Rob, you like penguins!

887
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,340
I love penguins!

888
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,660
Rob, that's why you should be running Linux.

889
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,380
Hi!

890
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,220
Well, you know, I like penguins just not that much.

891
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:48,460
Penguins.

892
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,580
Anyway.

893
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,660
That's why you should be wearing tuxedos, Rob.

894
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,900
I know, and that's why I should live in Antarctica.

895
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,420
And you should eat tuna.

896
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,020
You know, there's warm water penguins.

897
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,220
All right, well anyway, what about the damn penguin game?

898
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:07,820
Anyway, the penguin game is actually made by Yuji Naka that's called Let's Tap, which

899
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:12,780
is, and it has nothing to do with penguins, I think.

900
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:13,980
Like tap dancing?

901
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:21,180
I don't know, but I guess it's supposed to be another kind of, I guess, I don't know

902
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:26,700
if it's a music kind of game, but you use the Wiimote face down.

903
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:31,500
You basically, the game is played by facing the Wiimote, right?

904
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,300
You put it face down on something, a surface, and you hit that surface with your fists,

905
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,820
and it makes the Wiimote bounce, and then you use that in different little mini games.

906
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,180
Interesting.

907
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,500
I still think Let's Tap sounds-

908
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,620
Can I continue with my story, too?

909
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,980
Well, Let's Tap sounds like a tap dancing game to me.

910
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,380
I don't know if you remember this.

911
00:49:52,380 --> 00:50:03,180
Well, also, first of all, had I not been interrupted, I would have actually said something about

912
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:03,660
games.

913
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,820
Oh, that's what we do on this show.

914
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,820
All right, what else?

915
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:15,900
Well, the other game is one called 428, which is a game that uses real photos of people

916
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:22,860
in the city with text on it, but it was actually shown in the whole show role thing that they

917
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,980
did at the conference.

918
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,220
So this will be out in December.

919
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:32,060
I think we should release a sequel to Let's Tap called Let's Tap That Ass, or Let's Tap

920
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,620
That Keg.

921
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:33,980
There you go.

922
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,100
It should be like WarioWare, but everything is tap, you know?

923
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,260
Anyway, it pops, so it's all tap.

924
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,220
Tap Keg!

925
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,980
Also, release date for Let's Tap will be on the 4th of December.

926
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,660
Nice.

927
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,180
National Penguin Day.

928
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,820
Is it?

929
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,700
No, I made that up.

930
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,300
All right, we'll see.

931
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,340
Uh, yes.

932
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:58,300
Let's Read a Book.

933
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,900
That should be a game that comes out on DS.

934
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,620
Let's Read a Book.

935
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,580
Let's Read a Book.

936
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,260
Let's Get Edumacation.

937
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,420
Let's Watch Television Instead.

938
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,220
I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with Let's Read a Book.

939
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,380
I mean, seriously, some of the stuff that they come out with?

940
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,100
Weird.

941
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:11,900
Let's Poop.

942
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,400
Yeah.

943
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:19,100
So, um, anyways, there's some other announcements that they made during the second day of their

944
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:26,380
press event, and these were, of course, um, new WiiWare games, and of course the first

945
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,060
one, which I think they've already talked about before, Tetris Party.

946
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,620
It's a brand new Tetris game.

947
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:38,380
In fact, there's modes in it that kind of look like Luminous a bit, and, um, they're

948
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:46,460
actually going to even have a mode where it's called, um, Squat Mode, where you play using

949
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:51,180
your ass on, um, the Wii Balance Board, and you drop your pieces that way.

950
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,020
Squat?

951
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,060
I don't like hearing you squat and drop your pieces.

952
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,380
Yeah, I pay good money for my Wii.

953
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,320
Wow.

954
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,520
Yeah.

955
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,440
Yeah, they went there.

956
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,680
Um, and then of course, um, there's another game, which they're comparing to Little Big

957
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,320
Planet.

958
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,280
I'm sorry, no.

959
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,360
That's not even close.

960
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,320
But it's called Boings, because there's a Z at the end, because that's hip and cool.

961
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,680
Um, it's from the company Ninja Bees who have put out a bunch of other games which all seem

962
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,040
to look similar to each other, and, um, I guess they were saying that this game's kind

963
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,840
of, uh, Little Big Planet meets LocoRoco, and, um, it's a 2D, 3D puzzler platformer,

964
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:47,760
and it's gonna be, I guess it follows these elastic creatures who are called the Boings,

965
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,360
and, um, they can be grabbed and stretched and flicked across 30 levels of the game.

966
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,680
And I guess the game should be coming out pretty soon, because it's just been submitted

967
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,600
to Nintendo for approval, and, uh, should be out either October 20th or 27th.

968
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,440
Is no Little Big Planet, though, that's for sure.

969
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,880
But seriously, all their games look similar.

970
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,520
Um, I guess the Tetris one kind of looks interesting.

971
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,200
We'll see.

972
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,080
It's neat.

973
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,120
Um, by the way, we were talking about TapIt obviously a little bit ago.

974
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,600
Our chat room broke out in a game of BopIt.

975
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,920
Oh, wait, you remember BopIt?

976
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,120
BopIt!

977
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,680
Twist it!

978
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:28,080
Pull it!

979
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,200
You remember that whole thing?

980
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,000
The little device?

981
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,400
You had one of those.

982
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,880
I don't think I have one.

983
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,600
You had one.

984
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,280
I had one a long time ago.

985
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,600
Because I remember us trying to do it very drunkenly at one of those fantastic parties

986
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,640
that used to occur at your place.

987
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,880
Yeah, that was before OLR was on the air.

988
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,400
That was years ago.

989
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,080
But yeah, that was, uh, good times.

990
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,680
And anyway, I was trying to look on that for a clip of that commercial on YouTube to play

991
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,400
in the background, but all I could find were commercials for Kidz Bop.

992
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
I didn't want to play those on the air.

993
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,760
It would be kind of frightening.

994
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,840
Can you imagine if there was a Kidz Bop Sing Star?

995
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,400
All right, we've got to wrap up the Nintendo Press Conference, but there are so many more

996
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,840
games we didn't even begin to talk about.

997
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,120
Like Punch Out!

998
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,640
Hello, Punch Out!

999
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,560
Also, a new WarioWare game's coming out.

1000
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,840
Mario & Luigi 3.

1001
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,840
We have some of the other games that were coming out announced.

1002
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,320
For the Wii, there's a Klonoa remake, apparently.

1003
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,200
Or it might be a new...

1004
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,200
No, it's a remake.

1005
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,640
Door to Phantomville, it's new.

1006
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,600
Klonoa, Klonoa!

1007
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,840
There is a karaoke game coming from Hudson.

1008
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,400
Punch Out!

1009
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,840
We didn't even talk about that, but it looked like in the previews there was King Hippo

1010
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,640
was back in it.

1011
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,520
I know, I heard you.

1012
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,040
A game called Cosmic Walker, which is a spacewalking game.

1013
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,520
A memory game called Start with 100 Words.

1014
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,640
But Klonoa.

1015
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,360
I know there is...

1016
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,120
Remember these 100 words or you die!

1017
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,520
Forever Blue 2 Beautiful Ocean, the sequel to Endless Ocean, was also announced.

1018
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,280
And, and, and, some video from Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time that connects

1019
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,880
the DS to the Nintendo Wii.

1020
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,400
Wasn't this supposed to be a launch title?

1021
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,240
Klonoa.

1022
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:03,840
Shut up!

1023
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:04,800
Maybe?

1024
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,680
Trace Memory, also known as another code.

1025
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,800
Wand of Magic, an action RPG.

1026
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,840
That's all on the Wii.

1027
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,760
And then, of course, plenty of crap on the DS as well, including Mario & Luigi RPG 3

1028
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,440
and another WarioWare game.

1029
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,040
And, uh, a 3D version of Picross is supposed to come out as well.

1030
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,200
Wow, that sounds boring.

1031
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,040
And a fortune-telling game.

1032
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,280
You remember the old Taboo game on the NES?

1033
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,320
I remember Klonoa.

1034
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,360
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.

1035
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,800
But, oh, Jamie, Jamie, this game's right up your alley.

1036
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:39,920
This is, uh, this is great.

1037
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,800
Uh, Wagga, wait, what is this?

1038
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,640
Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode.

1039
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,080
It's a fashion game from Nintendo.

1040
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,720
But Klonoa.

1041
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,040
No, Klonoa's not in it.

1042
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,000
I have Klonoa.

1043
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,800
That game has a sad bummer ending.

1044
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:54,960
Spoiler!

1045
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,120
This show's gonna have a bummer ending if you don't shut up about Klonoa.

1046
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,960
Voldemort kills Klonoa.

1047
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,440
Really?

1048
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,080
Klonoa sounds like a sexually transmitted disease.

1049
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,440
It kind of does, actually.

1050
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:05,940
Oh.

1051
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,520
Hey, uh, that's about it we have for the Nintendo Press Conference.

1052
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,960
But in our pre-OLR Twit that we asked on the Twitter, uh, it's Twitter.com slash OLR,

1053
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,640
we asked this question to you guys.

1054
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,360
Did Nintendo's press conference this week make up for their lackluster E3 showing?

1055
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,080
Why or why not?

1056
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,400
Loki, what do you think before we get to the Twitter answers?

1057
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,240
Um, I thought that they made up for it a little bit, but there's still no mention of Disaster

1058
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:33,440
Day of Crisis, which I heard that they're waiting to see how it does in Europe before

1059
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,560
they release it over here.

1060
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,920
What?

1061
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,280
I mean, that's kind of retarded.

1062
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,040
Seriously, you're just waiting to see how it does in Europe?

1063
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,480
That's gonna piss people off.

1064
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,280
Um, but, I mean, I don't know.

1065
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,160
I'm kind of, it was a little bit more exciting than what they showed at E3, but at the same

1066
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,840
time, I look at what they're putting out.

1067
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,080
A remake of Punch-Out.

1068
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,320
A remake of Pikmin.

1069
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,960
Uh, I don't know.

1070
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,200
You know, a sequel to a game that we didn't get over here, which looks alright.

1071
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,560
But it's just, you know, it's just okay.

1072
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
It's something like, woo, awesome.

1073
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,960
So in other words, you wanted more original IPs.

1074
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,720
I want something a little bit, you know, they could have just shown Disaster Day of Crisis,

1075
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,920
because that actually looked pretty cool.

1076
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,960
What about Conduit?

1077
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,920
They did show Conduit.

1078
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,960
I mean, that's a new thing.

1079
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,160
Yeah, they showed Conduit, which, who knows when the hell that's gonna be published.

1080
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:29,040
In fact, um, there was something I heard about, like, WeMotion Plus being added to it, and

1081
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,280
so that means it's not coming out until after March.

1082
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,840
Probably, probably fall of next year by this, no, this time.

1083
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,040
You know, what are they, Sony?

1084
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,540
Seriously.

1085
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:42,100
Alright, uh, DarkSakura, what do you think?

1086
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,780
Did they redeem themselves from E3, or?

1087
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,740
Um, I don't know.

1088
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:48,340
I really don't know.

1089
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:52,580
It's kind of one of those things where you have to have, sometimes these press conferences

1090
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,460
look great, but then when you actually use the things that are teasing?

1091
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,980
I really, it's a really wait and see thing for me.

1092
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,740
It really is a wait and see thing for me.

1093
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,500
Just because I've gotten excited about stuff.

1094
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,900
And then found out it to be a big load of crap, and I don't like to be excited about

1095
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,620
loads of crap.

1096
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,820
I would rather think, oh, that looks like crap, and be pleasantly surprised.

1097
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,300
The conference was okay for me.

1098
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,060
There wasn't anything that made me squee.

1099
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:21,940
I think that's the thing.

1100
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:28,020
It was missing that certain Nintendo, that Nintendo fanboy squee giggle, I love you,

1101
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,900
Nintendo, have my babies, that was kind of missing.

1102
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:35,300
Well, then I'm glad you got something out of it, but for me, there wasn't really any

1103
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,780
of that.

1104
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:41,860
Seriously, punch out, punch out didn't look that, I mean, it just looked updated, like

1105
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:42,660
graphics wise.

1106
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,660
I mean, that's something that could have been released on WiiWare.

1107
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,780
Yeah, it doesn't look that different.

1108
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,340
It's just like, ooh, look, now it's like cel shaded.

1109
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,860
Awesome.

1110
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,820
Is it any different?

1111
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,100
All right, well, let's see what your Twitter users thought.

1112
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:58,820
GS68 says, sin and punishment too.

1113
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,900
Too bad I was in computer lab when I read that, so I had to contain my phantasmic screens.

1114
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:08,020
DJ Rama S says, nope, as much as I like the DSi and the new games, still wasn't much to

1115
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:08,740
bring to the table.

1116
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,820
Nice try, Nintee, see you next year.

1117
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,340
Act Def says, at first I thought it was going to be the same lackluster conference for the

1118
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,300
exception of the DSi, but then Nintendo went on and it was better.

1119
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:22,660
Crows said, yeah, at least this one wasn't about cowbells, animal crossing, Wii sport

1120
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,740
puppies, Wii music, or crazy drummers.

1121
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,700
I don't want the new DS.

1122
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,100
Dark Tetsuya says, well, I wasn't crazy about the idea of buying another DS revision.

1123
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,820
However, the new punch-out sounds kick-ass even without Tyson.

1124
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,580
Here's, okay, real quick.

1125
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,420
Here's what's bugging me about Nintendo.

1126
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,740
They're not trying to innovate at all.

1127
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,300
They're not.

1128
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,740
They're just putting out what they can get by is something new.

1129
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:44,100
Well, hold up, though.

1130
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:46,820
Oh, and wasn't the Wii console itself innovation?

1131
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,700
That's fine, but they did that, what, a couple years ago?

1132
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,140
Now it's time for something new.

1133
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,820
Time to keep up with the innovations.

1134
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,300
No, don't encourage them to put out new peripherals.

1135
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,820
No, I'm not talking about new peripherals.

1136
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,500
I'm talking about something new and innovative with the stuff that they already have.

1137
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,180
I mean, look at Animal Crossing.

1138
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,860
Oh, we added Wii Speak to it now.

1139
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,820
I mean, seriously, that is just tacked on right there.

1140
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,580
I mean, punch-out.

1141
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,780
Oh, now it's just like Wii Boxing, but it's cel-shaded.

1142
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,620
Big deal.

1143
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:14,820
It's not anything new.

1144
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,940
It's not a new IP.

1145
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,380
It's not anything new.

1146
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:21,220
It's just old made slightly new again.

1147
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,020
They don't get it.

1148
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,460
I think they're just watching what other people are doing, what's succeeding, and trying to

1149
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,940
emulate that, but they don't understand why it's working.

1150
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,340
More responses from the Twitter.

1151
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,740
Did the Nintendo press conference this week make up for the lackluster showing at E3?

1152
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,940
Chris says, almost everything at the conference was rumored for a while, so it was pretty

1153
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:38,740
meh itself.

1154
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,460
Picaruno says, just flat out hell no.

1155
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,100
Jacksonman says, yes, to an extent it did.

1156
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,380
Something new is better than nothing.

1157
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,380
Joshua Rover says, Rowever, Joshua Rowever.

1158
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,220
I had to spell it out.

1159
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,460
So it says, the recent press conference Nintendo held has completely redeemed them to me.

1160
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,700
They really do care about the hardcore that built them.

1161
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,500
Deakman says, nope, still pretty lackluster.

1162
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,660
Ionotropic says, hell no, they're still not catering to the core gamer.

1163
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,580
That's almost two completely conflicting answers there.

1164
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,220
That's really interesting between that and what Joshua said.

1165
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:15,300
And then Gerardimo says, no, their excuse for being lackluster will never be forgiven.

1166
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,980
They could have done all this at E3 and a separate event for Wii Music.

1167
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:19,860
Interesting.

1168
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:21,140
Very differing responses, too.

1169
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,380
Those are almost like polar opposites, some of those.

1170
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,860
So Nintendo definitely knows how to get people talking, if nothing else.

1171
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:31,780
All right, well, let's take a look at what's coming out a little sooner than some of these

1172
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:35,700
things we might have seen at the Wii conference, including, or DS, the Nintendo conference,

1173
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,540
including this week's release dates.

1174
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,580
Let's start overseas.

1175
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:40,340
We've got a few today's worth.

1176
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:48,420
On the 10th in the UK, we have Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway on PC, Korg DS10 on DS,

1177
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:54,100

1178
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,860
Remix on PSP.

1179
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:00,020
On the 13th, we have Equestrian Training on DS, which I know that you're just so looking

1180
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,980
forward to.

1181
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,780
Yay.

1182
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:07,380
On the 14th, we have NBA Live 09 coming out on damn near everything, but no one cares.

1183
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:09,940
Well, there you have it.

1184
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,420
Let's head on over to the US of A.

1185
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:13,860
Okay.

1186
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:19,060
In the US, there's actually a pretty good release week, starting off with some really

1187
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:19,700
stupid stuff.

1188
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,660
Pop QT Street Fashion Simulator from Koei is coming out on the DS.

1189
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:30,820
And on the Wii, we've got another party game collection, Game Party 2.

1190
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,900
Pretty much the same thing as Game Party 1, plus a little bit extra.

1191
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:39,060
Line Rider 2 Unbound, hopefully actually coming out this time on the Wii.

1192
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,340
Let's see here.

1193
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,740
We've got a lot of NBA games coming out this week.

1194
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:50,020
NBA 09 from Sony on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PSP.

1197
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,740
On DS, we have Spectrobes Beyond the Portals.

1198
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,260
It's a sequel to that game.

1199
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,780
Tenpin Alley 2, another bowling game for the Wii.

1200
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,140
And let's see here.

1201
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:25,620
Crash Mind Over Mutant on PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, and Wii and DS this week.

1202
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:29,540
Legend of Kage 2 on the DS.

1203
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,340
Oh cool, I remember that game.

1204
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:32,820
Yep.

1205
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,540
Bleach Dark Souls on the DS.

1206
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,820
Fracture on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1207
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,180
Imagine Babysitters on the DS.

1208
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,180
Eeeehhhhh!

1209
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,580
What, you have a problem with that game?

1210
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,860
Pray the Stars, it's actually kind of a neat little game, kind of like Katamari from Koe.

1211
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,700
And let's see here.

1212
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:01,700
Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune on the Wii and DS.

1213
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,740
Soldiers of Misfortune on the Wii and DS.

1214
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,100
Let's see here.

1215
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,460
Guilty Gear 2, Overture on Xbox 360.

1216
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:23,700
And some more Imagine games.

1217
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,300
Imagine Fashion Designer, New York.

1218
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:30,580
The Onimusha, The Essentials on 3-disc collector set.

1219
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,140
It's the first three Onimusha games.

1220
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,660
And My Spanish Coach on PSP.

1221
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:44,420
And that is it.

1222
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:50,180
Let's travel over to Japan and look at what's coming out over there on the Friday, October

1223
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:50,820
the 9th, right?

1224
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,540
9th is Friday.

1225
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,060
Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock makes its way to Japan.

1226
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,140
I do believe, though, this is not the bundle version.

1227
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,140
I think it's getting a standalone release this week.

1228
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:03,780
I think that's why it's on the release calendar again because Guitar Hero Aerosmith is also

1229
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,820
hitting Japan this week.

1230
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:05,780
I think that's the new one.

1231
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:08,420
They're getting a bundle and the standalone game.

1232
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,860
So that way I think, you know, I think Guitar Hero 3 was their first Guitar Hero game, if

1233
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,660
I remember correctly.

1234
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,220
So this is probably the first time they're seeing it standalone.

1235
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,940
That is all coming out on the Xbox 360.

1236
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,660
I imagine it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.

1237
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,220
Yes, it is.

1238
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:24,420
That's really it for those two systems this week.

1239
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,260
You gotta wait till next week for some of the bigger stuff.

1240
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:31,380
Uh, however, let's take a look and see what's coming out on the Nintendo Wii.

1241
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,980
Uh, Harvest Moon, Tree of- I'm sorry, that's a US release.

1242
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:39,140
Uh, Star Wars, The Force Unleashed comes out in Japan on the 9th.

1243
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,100
So that's pretty awesome.

1244
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,060
And let's check the PlayStation 2.

1245
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,460
Uh, same Guitar Hero games.

1246
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:52,660
Also, Infinity Plus gets a release as well as Daito Gaiken Koshiki Pachi Slot Simulator

1247
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,620
24.

1248
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:57,300
I don't think that's based off the TV series though, just so you know.

1249
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,500
Also, the PlayStation 2 version of Star Wars, The Force Unleashed, and a game called Will-O-Wisp

1250
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,740
Easter No Kiseki comes out as well.

1251
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:08,580
Checking out the handheld systems to see what's coming out on there.

1252
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,060
On the Nintendo DS, Snoopy DS.

1253
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,100
Squeenix is putting out a Snoopy DS game.

1254
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:19,060
Snoopy 2 Chuu Gen Taichi Ni Ei Ni Iku comes out.

1255
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,540
And yes, that is Snoopy as in Peanut Snoopy.

1256
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:24,900
Because those characters are very popular over there still.

1257
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:31,620
Nihongo de Asobo, Kawaii Konyu DS 2 comes out as well.

1258
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:39,300
And Tetsudo Musume DS Terminal Memory comes out in both a regular and limited edition

1259
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,820
pack on the Nintendo DS.

1260
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:48,740
And it looks like some game that centers around like, uh, uh, fly- uh, stewards and stewardesses

1261
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,940
on airlines.

1262
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:52,500
I don't know if it's some type of, like, drama turned game, but there you go.

1263
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:59,140
Um, also coming out on the Sony PSP.

1264
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:08,100
Um, Mahjong Portable Jansou Battle is getting a price reduction.

1265
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,700
And that's really about it.

1266
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:11,220
There is one other game coming out.

1267
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,900
Looks like- looks to be a big one.

1268
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,500
Uh, Macross Ace Frontier.

1269
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,340
Sweet!

1270
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,620
From Bandai Namco.

1271
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,740
And, and one more-

1272
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,660
Wait, wait, it's Ace Frontier?

1273
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,740
I thought the series was Macross Frontier.

1274
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,540
That's what they're calling it.

1275
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,900
Macross Ace Frontier.

1276
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:29,380
And one other game, uh, that looks- I think it's like an Othello- oh no, it's Go.

1277
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,420
It's a, uh, version of Go on your, uh, PSP.

1278
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,820
It's, uh, Umewaza Ikari no Yashi Igo.

1279
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:39,380
And I think that must be, like, a championship player that's on the cover.

1280
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,700
So, she's pretty.

1281
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,660
They're using her pretty face to sell just Go.

1282
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,780
So, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.

1283
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:50,500
Let's move back into some gaming news.

1284
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,380
Dark Sakura.

1285
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:52,420
Do we gotta?

1286
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,060
Yes, we gotta.

1287
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,420
Actually, this makes me very happy, and I'm gonna download it depending on how it plays.

1288
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:02,100
Um, but, um, they're bringing, um, pole position to the iPhone.

1289
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:03,140
That makes me very happy.

1290
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,140
It's all cutesy 3DE.

1291
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,060
It looks like- they look like little toy cars.

1292
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:13,860
Um, but it's, um, basically gonna be pole position.

1293
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,540
I mean, I- I hopefully- hopefully it doesn't play like Pac-Man did,

1294
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,460
because Pac-Man was a pain in the ass, or like, uh, Monkey Ball did.

1295
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:27,220
You know, where you have to move the- if- if you- if you do do it- do- do-

1296
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:33,220
if you do play with using- with moving the iPhone around, um, I would prefer that it

1297
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:39,220
be a little bit more natural and intuitive and not have to be held at some funky-ass bizarre angle.

1298
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,420
But, I'm gonna give it a try.

1299
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:47,060
I mean, it's $9.99, but I think that, um, I think that it might be worthwhile

1300
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,660
after a check arrives at my house.

1301
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:50,520
All right.

1302
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,540
And it's pole position.

1303
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:54,180
It's old school.

1304
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:56,660
Yeah.

1305
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:00,580
Sadly, you don't really get the cool crashes in pole position.

1306
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,380
It was just a little explosion graphic, but at least it was an explosion.

1307
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:09,540
And who- I- I- I did- I remember the pole position cabinets from back in the day.

1308
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,660
That was good times.

1309
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,100
That's- that was 80s gaming.

1310
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,140
I loved the sit-down ones.

1311
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,780
You know that we actually built our first main cabinet out of a pole position?

1312
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,220
Yeah, you still got it, right?

1313
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,180
Somewhere, I think?

1314
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:22,340
Well, now we've got our- our, uh, reefer Pac-Man thing that we were gonna put it in.

1315
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:23,560
Cool.

1316
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,420
All right.

1317
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:32,020
Well, uh, D3 is putting out a new game, um, called Eat Lead.

1318
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:37,860
And, um, it's kind of interesting the way that they promoted this thing.

1319
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:44,900
Um, it stars a supposedly old school, uh, action game superhero called Mat Hazard,

1320
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:50,100
who they created his own, um, kind of legacy, basically.

1321
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:55,940
A bunch of knockoff games they have screenshots for, uh, from a website that they created

1322
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:57,780
called Weapons of Mat Destruction.

1323
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:02,420
And, um, they have one that looks just like, uh, Altered Beast.

1324
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:10,180
They've got, um, you know, Mat Hazard 3D, Fistful of Hazard, Mat- Hazmat Carts.

1325
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:16,500
And, uh, you only live, uh, 1370 times.

1326
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:22,740
And, um, so along with all this stuff, the game itself is actually gonna be a 3D, um,

1327
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:23,240
shooter.

1328
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:28,980
And, um, some interesting stuff to go along with- along with that.

1329
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:34,180
Let's see, got a bunch of, uh, information that you probably haven't heard yet, including,

1330
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,860
um, the fact that there's gonna be some pretty cool voice actors in there.

1331
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:43,060
You've got, uh, Neil Patrick Harris in there, as long- um, along with, uh, Will Arnett,

1332
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,060
who are gonna be doing some of the voice talent for the game.

1333
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,260
It's actually gonna be a third person shooter, and it's got a script written by, I guess,

1334
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:54,900
this guy, uh, David Ellis, who did, um, I guess the Doctor Who serial, the Faceless

1335
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:55,400
Ones.

1336
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,480
And the game itself is gonna be- it kinda reminds me a little bit of Coded Arms, I

1337
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:04,680
guess, because, um, the shooter game itself will take place across all sort of different,

1338
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:09,400
um, video game cliches, but you can actually hack into the different characters and do

1339
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
different things to them, so that's kinda neat.

1340
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:18,280
And, um, also, they're gonna be, I guess, releasing later on some Flash games based

1341
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:23,320
off the, um, 16-bit retro games that they were teasing that he actually made.

1342
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,560
So, those will be coming out a little bit later.

1343
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,640
So, what is this, like, a parody of games?

1344
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,080
Yeah, basically, here's what it is, it's all, get ready for a fictional account of

1345
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:38,040
the world's most popular video game hero of the 1980s, Matt Hazard is coming out of

1346
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,280
retirement and making his next-gen comeback.

1347
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,440
Okay, to me, this sounds like one of those things that could be actually, like, really

1348
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:45,560
genius or really stupid, you know what I mean?

1349
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,680
It sounds like a serious-

1350
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,080
Some of those movies like Meet the Spartans, right?

1351
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,400
Hey, it makes fun of all these great movies that came out in the past year, but it's

1352
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,560
just, just the dumbest thing you'll ever see.

1353
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,560
There's a lot of, like, games that have done it right, like, I think, like, Time

1354
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:04,040
Splitters did the whole making fun of shooters games, uh, kind of, right?

1355
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,960
They actually just went really bizarre with that game, but it was fun, and that was the

1356
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:11,880
best part about it, and I hope they come out with a new one, because they released some

1357
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,760
teaser, uh, concept art for it this week as well.

1358
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,400
Uh, but anyways, um, and then it says, um, he's making his next-gen comeback in all of

1359
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:26,440
his old enemies in a hilarious, um, or against all of his old enemies in a hilarious parody

1360
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,640
of the last 25 years of gaming.

1361
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,120
I don't know, it reminds me of something like a character that could have been, like, one

1362
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:37,960
of the shareware characters, you know, from, like, you know, Apogee or, uh, Epic.

1363
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,400
Uh, it could be cool.

1364
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,680
Guess we'll see, comes out in, uh, I think February.

1365
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,680
All right, we'll see.

1366
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:49,480
Uh, one other thing that's coming out relatively soon, a Spore expansion.

1367
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,760
That's right, because Spore wasn't enough.

1368
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,400
Spore expansion, November 18th, the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack.

1369
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:02,880
It's only 20 bucks, um, and, you know, there isn't much out there about what this is, but,

1370
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,680
you know, if it's the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack, do you think it might be, oh, I don't

1371
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,400
know, new parts for your creatures that you make?

1372
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,640
Uh, well, it was leaked on, uh, apparently Amazon had the store pages up first, but now

1373
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:18,480
that's also being spotted on GameStop, so, it is coming, and on November 18th, I, now,

1374
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:22,080
my question is, digital download, surely this has to be something they're going to offer

1375
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,920
as that as well, I mean, why not, right?

1376
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,220
You're willing to give them money, so, uh, no word as to how many parts we're talking

1377
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,320
about yet, but for $20, there better be quite a few.

1378
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,560
Ooh, does the new expansion come with new DRM?

1379
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,560
Because that'd be awesome.

1380
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,920
I mean, yeah, I'd pay the 20 bucks if it'll uninstall, uninstall Secure ROM.

1381
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,480
No, I'm just kidding, I shouldn't have to pay anything to get rid of that, but, you

1382
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,800
know what I'm saying.

1383
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:49,000
So, there you go, Spore expansion, for those of you Spore addicts, and, uh, I think I said

1384
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,600
this during Bobby's show, I don't know if I said this earlier in this show, but, uh,

1385
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,000
some of the monsters in Silent Hill Homecoming kind of look like they were made in Spore.

1386
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
They're kind of creepy looking, like arms off people's backs and stuff, scary.

1387
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Very scary.

1388
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,240
Are there any penis monsters?

1389
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,680
There are no penis monsters.

1390
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,680
Fail!

1391
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:10,320
Why would you want to ruin Silent Hill with penis monsters, you know, put penis monsters

1392
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,320
in a game that's already-

1393
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,960
It's in your head, so that's good enough.

1394
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:13,960
Exactly.

1395
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,080
Is he just as prolific?

1396
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,480
That's what I hear, but I haven't gotten to him yet, I haven't played enough, so we'll

1397
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:19,480
see.

1398
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,200
Yeah, VX JasonXV in chat says, no one bought Spore except for you.

1399
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:23,200
Yeah, probably true.

1400
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,200
Bobby did!

1401
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,200
I'm probably the only one that actually bought it.

1402
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Oh yeah, that's right, Bobby did.

1403
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,200
So, two people have Spore!

1404
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,200
In the whole world.

1405
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,600
No, apparently they've sold at least a million, I think, as I saw some figure earlier, so

1406
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,600
go figure.

1407
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:41,200
Alright, anyhow, um, let's take a moment to travel back in time and revisit the classics

1408
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:46,360
in a little segment we call the Classic Video Game of the Week.

1409
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,240
And DarkSakura is the one that likes to dig through her massive gaming collection to find

1410
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,960
a game worthy of the title.

1411
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,080
DarkSakura, what'd you pick for us tonight?

1412
01:14:54,080 --> 01:15:00,000
Well, first of all, I'd like to play the intro to this in just a second, which is why I like

1413
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
the one I did.

1414
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Okay.

1415
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
But wait a second before you try it.

1416
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,240
But the game is called Nekkatsu Koko Dodgeball Boo, which is basically Super Dodgeball over

1417
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,240
here.

1418
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,240
It's one of the Kunio games.

1419
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,240
So.

1420
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
Nice.

1421
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,240
Shall we have a little bit of intro?

1422
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,240
Uh, we shall.

1423
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,240
Let's see, do we want the whole Neo Geo splash screen and everything?

1424
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,240
Why not?

1425
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:24,240
That's what a Neo Geo sounds like when you press the on button.

1426
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,240
Yep.

1427
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,240
Super Dodgeball!

1428
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:43,240
Can I tell us a little bit more about Super Dodgeball?

1429
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,440
Anyway, um, Super Dodgeball basically is just that.

1430
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:49,440
It's dodgeball.

1431
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,000
You've got your characters, you've got your captain and your other characters, and then

1432
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,440
you have the ones that are inside the court, and then you have the ones that stand around

1433
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:07,480
the court, and as you eliminate characters, basically a little angel takes them to the

1434
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:09,940
top of the screen and they go away.

1435
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,920
But your life bar is basically how many teammates you have left.

1436
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:21,340
So you defeat the other team by knocking out the teammates, I mean it is, you know, dodgeball.

1437
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:24,700
So you have to keep knocking them down with the ball until they're just done.

1438
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:30,160
And you've also got, um, a special throw called your power shot that your, um, team captain

1439
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,360
can use.

1440
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,920
I have to clarify some things in chat, because I love this game.

1441
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,600
I was very excited when Dark Cyber picked it.

1442
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,800
I really do love this game.

1443
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,360
Uh, Rama asked in chat, isn't this the same version as on NES, same characters?

1444
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,040
No it's not, because these are like custom characters, whereas the NES had the very general,

1445
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,960
you know, like it was, they're definitely related games.

1446
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:52,960
They play very similarly.

1447
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,080
They're both in the Kunio series.

1448
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,980
The one that I linked here, though, is actually the, uh, I believe the captain is like the

1449
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:13,040
main character from, um, what we got is River City Ransom, uh, Nekketsu, um, Hot Blooded

1450
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:14,880
High School Story or whatever.

1451
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:21,080
Um, but anyway, uh, but with, uh, I think the special edition, because honestly it has

1452
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,080
better music.

1453
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,000
But in this one, though, you start off, you know, by going around the world, and you pick

1454
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,440
your team from different places, but you start off with a game between Dallas and Chicago

1455
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,440
to show who's gonna, you know, represent the United States.

1456
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,680
And then you go around to England, Iceland, uh, China, Africa, although in later versions

1457
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:45,120
it was changed to Kenya, you know, so you could run as fast as Kenyans, and Japan.

1458
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:54,640
Um, but you, uh, when you beat Japan you actually get your, uh, World Cup gift to you by a ninja.

1459
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:01,120
So, um, yeah, what I was basically saying is that the game, um, was part of the, uh,

1460
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:06,480
the Kunio series, um, the first one being Nekketsu Koha Kunia-kun, which was what we

1461
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,880
got as, uh, Renegade over here.

1462
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:14,200
And we know that the other one in the series was, uh, River City Ransom.

1463
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:19,200
The, the way that the game starts is basically Kunio gets hit in the head with a dodgeball,

1464
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:22,200
and his teammates go and beat him up.

1465
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:29,040
And the teams of Dallas and Chicago were actually, um, the teams of Nekketsu High School and,

1466
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:34,600
um, Hanazono High School in the Japanese version, so, they, they of course modified it.

1467
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:40,160
There was an NES version, um, that actually was, uh, published by Technos, which was the

1468
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,280
one that released the arcade version.

1469
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,000
But it's not even the same, it's not, I mean, from what I remember, okay, sorry, I just,

1470
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,320
I'm very passionate about my dodgeball games.

1471
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Um, it actually had six members, you had the team captain and five others, and they were

1472
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,280
all the same size instead of having your captain be, like, over huge.

1473
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,880
And, um, you could only have three players inside the court, and you could arrange your

1474
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,720
positions though, um, at the beginning of each match, so you could, you know, make use

1475
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,880
of your different techniques.

1476
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:15,040
Um, you could actually adjust, um, your energy, throwing power, throwing technique, and ball

1477
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,440
break, which is, um, the, the curve.

1478
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,040
You had agility, catching technique, and damage capacity.

1479
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:28,960
Um, there are also two extra teams, there was, uh, India and USSR, um, so, it was, it

1480
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,520
had a lot of the same stuff, but had some pretty significant changes, I guess, to make

1481
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,400
it work on the NES, that's, that's, we had to deal with a lot of that, you remember the

1482
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,040
original version of Strider in the middle of the NES?

1483
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,040
Yeah, but...

1484
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,040
It was based off of comic books, though.

1485
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:44,920
Yeah, and Strider was just, like, like, it was also a totally different game.

1486
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,960
It was, it was, the story was based off of comic books.

1487
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:50,800
It's not even the same type of game, like, the Sega Strider was just, like, a straight

1488
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,320
up, like, arcade action game, whereas, I, I don't know, there was that more open world

1489
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,320
feel to the NES one.

1490
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:58,920
They had, they had to do with the actual storage, they used to make it to fit all the levels

1491
01:19:58,920 --> 01:19:59,920
well.

1492
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,920
I remember that.

1493
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,920
But anyway, we've already done Strider.

1494
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,920
Yeah, sorry.

1495
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,920
Freakin' art-ass game.

1496
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,640
Let me just say this, because VX JasonXV in chat brings up a related game.

1497
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,160
Was anyone else epic disappointed by Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball?

1498
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:15,760
Yes, I played the demo, and I thought it was awful, awful, awful, awful, and I, I quit

1499
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,620
in about five minutes, and maybe I shouldn't judge something completely based off five

1500
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:22,440
minutes of gameplay, but honestly, with demos, that's about how long you have to sell me,

1501
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,760
and I, it made me miss this game, is what it did.

1502
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,040
Well there's, um, other ones, and one of them is, I, I'm gonna mention the one that we're

1503
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,560
playing the music for right now, because I love this version, but the other versions

1504
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:39,400
that were released, um, was the X6800, um, that was put out, see, um, uh, Tecmos only

1505
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,800
did the Famicom and, um, arcade versions, uh, I caught my breath for a second, but there

1506
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,960
were other ones on X6800, it was released by SPS, which was a direct arcade port.

1507
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:58,400
PC Engine had, um, Nekketsu Koko Dojiboru Bupishi Bangai-hen, which translates to Nekketsu

1508
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:04,440
High School Dodgeball Club Bonus PC Edition, that was released by Natsoftsoft, um, in 1990,

1509
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:10,280
which I've played this version a ton, it's actually pretty cool, um, and you actually

1510
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:15,080
are having to fight off, um, aliens, disguised as dodgeball fighters.

1511
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:20,360
There's a Windows version of the Famicom port that was done by BRS Corps, in 2003, PlayStation

1512
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:25,960
2, um, had an, uh, arcade port, that was put out by Hamster Corps, as part of the Oretachi

1513
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:31,680
Gessen Zoku line-up, uh, the Famicom version came out on, um, Gameboy as part of the Kunio

1514
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:37,080
Kuneketsu Collection 1, there was, um, the version on Wii Virtual Console, which we got

1515
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:44,920
over on September 22nd, so not too long ago, um, there also are official, um, sequels,

1516
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:51,180
so there was Nekketsu Koko Dodgeball Bu-kyoteki, Dodgeball Soldier no Maki, which is Fearsome

1517
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:57,120
Rival, Tale of the Dodge Soldier, for Gameboy, um, we also got Kunio Kuno Dodgeball Daiyo

1518
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,760
Zenin Shugo, which is, um, it's Kunio's Dodgeball Gather Everyone, that came out on Super Famicom,

1519
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,760
which I have played that one before too, and you have other teams, like, um, Italy, um,

1520
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,840
it just is Arab, it doesn't say Arabia, uh, France, Brazil, and Germany, and then the

1521
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:18,520
one that we're having a video of here, which is, um, the Kunio no Nekketsu Dojiboro Densetsu,

1522
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,360
which is Kunio's Nekketsu Dodgeball Legends, um, the Neo-Geo release, um, that actually,

1523
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:30,960
um, Tecmos did release this one, so that was pretty cool, but you also have, um, special

1524
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,360
moves not just for your captain, but for, you have several main characters, and you

1525
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:39,680
have to do Street Fighter II-like commands to get them to go off, like you saw the girls

1526
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:45,040
do their little attacks in there, um, but you've got seven playable characters, and,

1527
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,920
um, you also have your, uh, them being the main characters, so Nekketsu Kōha Kunio Kun,

1528
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:58,280
you know, like in Renegade over here, um, also Super Dodgeball Advance, we, um, it wasn't

1529
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:05,560
actually a Kunio game, so, but it was done with a lot of the same character style and

1530
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:10,520
game play, it was put out by a million of you, but they also, the million did do an

1531
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:16,360
official DS sequel called Chō Nekketsu Kōha Kunio Kun Dodgeball Boo, I just like saying

1532
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,360
it.

1533
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,360
Well.

1534
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:23,360
And, there's also Super Dodgeball Brawlers that's supposed to be by Axis, it was supposed

1535
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,360
to come out, did it already come out?

1536
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,360
Yeah.

1537
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,360
It came out, like, in May.

1538
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,360
Yeah, it was supposed to be out.

1539
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:33,000
I haven't played that one yet, I played the Game Boy Advance one, but not that one.

1540
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,560
But it's supposed to, um, be used in the, the River City Ransom characters.

1541
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,560
Awesome.

1542
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:38,560
Let's check that out.

1543
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:45,040
Which was, you know, the downtown hot-blooded fight, bar, story, whatever.

1544
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,160
I wonder if you can go in there and order food at, um, a, uh, deli.

1545
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:53,000
I wonder if it has that booty, like in the spa, remember, remember River City Ransom?

1546
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
8-bit ass?

1547
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:01,920
I just, I'm still gonna have to play the Japanese version of the PC engine of, uh, River City

1548
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,920
Ransom for you.

1549
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,920
Just because it's so cool, they go into a little, um, kisaten and order food, and they're

1550
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,400
all like, I need a little out of me smiley faces.

1551
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,680
I always liked that the smiles were free.

1552
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,000
I always liked that the smiles were free.

1553
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Yeah.

1554
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
That was great.

1555
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Alright, anything else on Super Dodgeball?

1556
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Um, no.

1557
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,520
Alright, there you have it.

1558
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,000
Your classic game of the week, and a real classic, and, yeah, don't bother with pirates

1559
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
and ninjas.

1560
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,400
This is because I picked something I had already done before and forgot about it.

1561
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,400
Dodgeball.

1562
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,400
That's alright, it's bound to happen.

1563
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,400
How many weeks have we been doing this now?

1564
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,400
At least 50.

1565
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,480
We're, we started it on episode 250.

1566
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,160
Are we running out of classic games?

1567
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:36,160
No!

1568
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,160
Never!

1569
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,680
I'm like, cause I can think of a few we haven't done.

1570
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:40,680
Like what?

1571
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,480
Uh, you have never named one single, solitary Commodore 64 game.

1572
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,920
Guess what, uh, System Jamie didn't play.

1573
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:52,160
Well, what, if you're ever out during a week, I will bring a Commodore 64 game in the picture.

1574
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,840
I already know which one I'm gonna do, too.

1575
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,840
I already know.

1576
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:55,840
Okay.

1577
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,360
And it's one of those games people are gonna go, WTF is he picking that game?

1578
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,200
Cause you better watch out, or I'll start busting out the Colecovision, yo.

1579
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,200
Alright, wait.

1580
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,840
Mouse Chaps, Venture.

1581
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,840
Alright.

1582
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,840
Plenty more to come.

1583
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:06,840
We have to carry us through episode 400.

1584
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,840
Carnival of Gorf.

1585
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:08,840
Gorf.

1586
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,240
I frickin' love Gorf.

1587
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:11,760
I almost did Gorf.

1588
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,880
Okay, Gorf is this soon.

1589
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
Maybe next week.

1590
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
Maybe next week.

1591
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:16,880
Little teaser for next week, Gorf.

1592
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,880
Alright, anyhow.

1593
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,280
Uh, that's gonna do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but hey, stay tuned.

1594
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:26,240
There's plenty more to come after a quick break, and uh, hey, during the break tonight,

1595
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:29,120
since there's not a lot of free commercials for the free break anymore, cause no one's

1596
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,920
sending me stuff, but that's okay, we got something even better.

1597
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:33,440
Giving stuff away.

1598
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,080
If you were paying attention to last week's show, we're drawing the names right after

1599
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,640
this, if you weren't paying attention to last week's show, you got about five minutes to

1600
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,920
find it, cause we're giving away some free Xbox 360 games, right after the, yes, I said

1601
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,720
games, and I'll explain more, a little bit about that, uh, right after the break, but

1602
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,880
for you podcast listeners, you have to wait like five seconds for that little transition

1603
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,880
noise.

1604
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,880
That's all you need.

1605
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:56,360
Uh, but live listeners, you have to sit and listen to some music while we take a break,

1606
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,920
rest our voices, potty, drinks, all that stuff.

1607
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,720
So uh, well not like drink from the potty, that would be nasty, but you know, pot, yeah,

1608
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:03,720
forget it.

1609
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,120
Alright, we'll be right back with more Orange Lamps Radio right after this.

1610
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:16,400
Alright, if you were listening last week, at this part of the show where we usually

1611
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:21,280
do the free break, you know that we are doing a contest, and we are giving away copies of

1612
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:26,000
Feeding Frenzy 2, that's right, the sequel to Feeding Frenzy, uh, available on the Xbox

1613
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,040
360 is where we're giving away the game for, thank you to PopCap for sending along the

1614
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,840
codes, so some of our listeners could try out the game.

1615
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:37,900
So thank you Random.org for choosing some numbers right out of our mailbox, and our

1619
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,520
You want to clap?

1620
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:53,680
Alright, uh, there you go.

1621
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:59,120
And winner number two of the code, yeah that's right, we're giving away two codes, that's

1622
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:04,680
right, I lied last week, that's right, I lied, we actually have two codes to give away, and

1623
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:13,680
the second winner of the code is ActDeft, yay, there you go, there you have it, thank

1624
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:18,120

1625
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:26,000
go home, good day sir, alright, no just kidding, sorry guys, maybe next time, alright, so we'll

1626
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,960
get those codes sent off to our winners, but for now we're going to get back into Orange

1627
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:37,280
Lounge Radio.

1628
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,880
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, October

1629
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:47,600
the 5th, 2008, where we are right in the middle of episode number 297, and of course we tape

1630
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,760
live every week, Sunday nights at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby

1631
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,720
Black Wolf show, and if you can't join us live though, you know you can always interact

1632
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:01,600
with us through the Twitter, through the live journal, the email bag that we'll get to later,

1633
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:06,080
there's just tons and tons of ways, we will, yeah, you have to do the mailbag, sorry, like

1634
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:10,600
it or not, alright, but first we're going to do some more gaming news, right Loki, yes

1635
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:18,120
that's correct, in fact, little known fact, there is a Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2 coming

1636
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:23,320
out, and this is not to be confused with another expansion disc we'll be talking about in a

1637
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:30,720
little bit, but Volume 2 of course contains some tracks that were available on the download

1638
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:37,840
sites, both PlayStation Network and on Xbox Live Marketplace, the track list contains

1639
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:44,360
20 different songs, and it includes Avenged Sevenfold Afterlife, Blondie with Call Me,

1640
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:53,720
Weezer, El Scorcho, Devo, Girl You Want, Maximo Park, Girls Who Play Guitars, Disturbed, Indestructible,

1641
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:59,920
Angels and Airwaves, It Hurts, The Cars, Just What I Needed, The Police, Message in a Bottle,

1642
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:07,600
Pixies, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Duran Duran with Rio, Motley Crue, Saints of LA, which

1643
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:13,600
I want to say that was a free track, so that's not really fair, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Simple

1644
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:24,320
Man, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow, Hayo, Nighish Nails, The Perfect Drug, Fall Out Boy, This

1645
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:31,960
Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race, it's a goddamn arms race actually, but it's censored, yes,

1646
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:38,400
Papa Roach, Time is Running Out, Garbage, Why Do You Love Me, Jesus Priest, You've Got

1647
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:44,640
Another Thing Coming, and Smashing Pumpkins Zero, and this will be available for all four

1648
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:52,400
systems and will also, and I guess this may be a trend coming soon to download packs,

1649
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:58,440
it will allow you to basically download this to your hard drive with a code that's included

1650
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:05,200
in the back of the manual, and this will also have I think achievements as well, because

1651
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:10,060
you can play this game standalone as well. Well that sucks, because I have ten of those

1652
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:14,480
songs already, is the game going to reimburse me for the ten I already bought? No. Lame.

1653
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:22,360
Well you also have access to Xbox Live Marketplace, why would you spend this? Because I want achievements.

1654
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:26,240
Why I cannot, well I mean you know, I don't really, but I'm being Devil's Advocate here,

1655
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:31,240
I mean why is that fair that somebody who waited to buy it gets to get a thousand more

1656
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:37,160
gamerscore? This is really meant I think for the people that don't have live, and this

1657
01:30:37,160 --> 01:30:41,320
is the only way that they can buy expansion packs. Fine. But it says yeah, included code

1658
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:46,200
allows these songs to be downloaded and played with Rock Band or Rock Band 2 via the PlayStation

1659
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,720
Network, of course this is the PlayStation 3 version I'm looking at the back of. So that's

1660
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:55,800
interesting though that it can be downloaded for Rock Band 1 as well, so, hmm, interesting.

1661
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:05,960
But yeah, this game does not require you to have the first game, or the second game. Interesting,

1662
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,280
I don't know though, again I already kind of own pretty much the whole game, so there

1663
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:12,480
you have it. But for those who don't, and you know to be honest, probably just buy them

1664
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:18,400
online, probably a little cheaper anyways. Well actually no, if it's $2 a song, that'd

1665
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:24,520
be about $40, and this is going to retail for $29.99, so you save a little bit of money.

1666
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:27,720
I'm curious, is there anyone in our chat room right now that would be interested in buying

1667
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:33,680
this? I bet not a one. Just because everybody in our chat room is obviously online enough

1668
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,280
where they're online chatting with our show that they probably don't, you know their console's

1669
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:41,360
online too I imagine. I guess it's good for those that don't have it, or for those that

1670
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,720
are on the Wii where that's not really implemented yet even though it's supposed to be. Yeah,

1671
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:50,160
it will be hopefully with this one, so maybe by the time the Wii version comes out, because

1672
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:54,160
I think this is not scheduled to come out until November, it's around the same time

1673
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:59,440
as the Wii version. Alright well that's not the only expansion for Rock Band coming soon,

1674
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:02,840
but here's the interesting thing, the other expansion that's coming is not something that

1675
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:09,400
you can already download, it's a brand new track pack, it's ACDC Live is coming. Sweet!

1676
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:13,320
Here's the weird thing though, it's a Walmart and Sam's Club exclusive because I believe

1677
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:19,480
there's a new ACDC album that is an exclusive, so go figure. And for those of you in foreign

1678
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:24,200
countries that are pow pow pouting about that, hey, guess what, also for Europe, Australia,

1679
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:27,860
and New Zealand in early December, so they didn't forget about you unless you're not

1680
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:32,440
in one of those countries, and they did forget about you. All the songs from the disc, you

1681
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:37,280
can use them in Rock Band and Rock Band 2 using an export authentication code, but here's

1682
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:43,400
the thing, you can only use that once per disc. And I think that's the same with this

1683
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:48,880
track pack 2 as well, I think it's only once per disc. Because, I mean come on, they're

1684
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,480
smart enough to know, hey, they're just going to buy it and download it for five bucks to

1685
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:56,800
all their friends, you know. You can only do that with Rock Band 1. And by the way,

1686
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,000
that $29 price point is only for the Playstation 2 version, if you want the fancier ones for

1687
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,880
a 360 PS3 or Wii, $39.88 is the magic price. That's fucked up. November 2nd, here's the

1688
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:11,280
weird thing again, if you want it on Wii though, you gotta wait, November 16th is the date

1689
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:18,120
for you. 360 PS3 and PS2, you get it on November 2nd. That's ACDC Live. And apparently the

1690
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:24,800
game has its own set of achievements, which is very much in line with the same thing Loki

1691
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,140
was talking about, although, funny enough, I'm seeing a lot of news this week on the

1692
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:32,280
blogs about this, I'm not seeing a damn thing about what you just told us. Is that because

1693
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:36,880
you told us a secret or what? No, I don't know why this isn't out there, I mean, it's

1694
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,880
going to be available soon, it's just maybe it's not as exciting as ACDC. I guess not.

1695
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:45,720
But there is a lot of confusion, I know, with at least us selling this, you know, it's like,

1696
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:49,200
is this the same damn thing as the Walmart one, and this is something, but no, it's actually

1697
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,560
something completely different. Interesting. And I was going to say, probably the reason

1698
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:59,800
why it's not coming out on the, or coming out on the 16th for the Wii is because Rock

1699
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,560
Band 2 is going to be the only one you'll be able to download that one for, I think,

1700
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,680
or to do download play on. Alright. Well, there you have it, coming soon. If you like

1701
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,980
ACDC, get ready to ring your hell's bells. Whoa, whoa, hold on a second, let me, actually

1702
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,400
no, wait, no, that doesn't make any sense. I was going to say, well, that doesn't make

1703
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:20,480
any sense, it's coming out on the 16th, and that means that you'll be able to save stuff

1704
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:24,120
to your SD member cards, but I forgot, games already allow you to do that, it's channels

1705
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:28,520
that'll be coming in 2009. Right, and it's 2009. Yeah, so there you have it. Alright,

1706
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:35,000
we'll move on, more gaming news. Well, for anyone who played the first episode for Penny

1707
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,020
Arcade and liked it, their second one is going to be cheaper. Hothead Games is actually listening

1708
01:34:41,020 --> 01:34:51,040
to consumer feedback, and is going to be releasing the game for 1200 Microsoft points, which

1709
01:34:51,040 --> 01:35:05,400
is 10 pounds 20 pence in pounds. It'll be 1495 US dollars on PC, which is 7 pounds 50

1710
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:14,520
in the UK, so. 15 dollars is still expensive for that game anyways. That's ridiculous to

1711
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:21,720
charge 20 bucks for, and I'm not sure if I want to buy the sequel. Well, I'm still interested.

1712
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:27,880
I haven't finished the demo of the first one yet, to be honest. I don't know, I never finished

1713
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:36,360
the first one. I got bored with it too quick, played other things. Oh well. Well, if Penny

1714
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,880
Arcade Adventures Volume 2 is not the thing for you, then maybe something that they'll

1715
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:46,180
show at Tokyo Game Show will be, and of course, Tokyo Game Show is right around the corner,

1716
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:51,240
and we've got a listing of stuff that they're going to show off there, at least in Sony's

1717
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:56,920
booth. There's going to be a bunch of titles, and a few unannounced titles, which we'll

1718
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,000
just have to be surprised about. But some of the things that they're going to be showing

1719
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:08,860
off, Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes, looks like Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Final Fantasy

1720
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:15,560
Dissida, or Dissida Final Fantasy. I like how they have Ratchet- Isn't that that awesome

1721
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,280
looking fighting game? Yeah, that's the fighting game for the Final Fantasy fighting game.

1722
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:25,560
I want to see more on that. Ratchet and Clank, Maruhai Mission Ignition, that's kind of a

1723
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:42,040
cool name, Bleach Soul Carnival Potapon 2, Shin Sengoku Masui, I guess, Multirade. I

1724
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:51,360
think that's the Gundam one. Let's see what else we have here. New Idolmaster game, Idolmaster

1725
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:57,720
SP, Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam. Wow, there's three Gundams in that title.

1726
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:03,920
That's kind of crazy. Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology 2, and of course in there

1727
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,600
there's going to be three unannounced Sony titles as well. And then some third party

1728
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,000
titles are going to be showing off. Guitar Hero, Legend of the Rock, FIFA 09, Street

1729
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:19,640
Fighter IV, Resident Evil 5, Luminous Supernova, Metal Gear Online, Way of the Samurai 3, Sonic

1730
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:27,320
World Adventure, SOCOM Confrontation, PlayStation Home, that's not a game, and Motorstorm 2,

1731
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:36,560
Little Big Planet, Resistance 2, Smackdown vs. Ral 9, Dice Warriors Gundam 2, and R2

1732
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,320
Ultimate Ninja Storm. GS68 in the chat room asks, Luminous Supernova? I believe that was

1733
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:46,960
a game that came up earlier, it's the new PS3 network Luminous game, right? Yes, that's

1734
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,160
the one. That's pretty much the same damn game you've played for years, but with new

1735
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:56,560
skins and new modes, I think we talked about it on a previous show. There you go. Hey,

1736
01:37:56,560 --> 01:38:00,400
Sony's not the only one that's exhibiting some stuff at Tokyo Game Show. Konami's going

1737
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,000
to be showing some things on the show floor, which, here's the interesting part, Metal

1738
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,240
Gear Solid 4 is one of the games they're showing, so, I don't know. I guess, well, it's alright,

1739
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:12,360
I mean, for a company to show games that are already out. I mean, hell, when we went to

1740
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,920
E3 one year, they were still showing off Oblivion. Granted, they were still releasing download

1741
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,960
content on a regular basis, at Bethesda, but whatever. Konami is also showing off World

1742
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:28,280
Soccer, winning 11, 2009. Gensu Suikoden Tikris, which is that new DS one, and it's going to

1743
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:32,800
be playable, that new Suikoden on the DS. Ah, it looks pretty hot. Castlevania Judgment

1744
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,120
will be out on the floor, so will the new Castlevania Order of Ecclesia. Silent Hill

1745
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:40,040
Homecoming will also be on the floor, even though it's out, and I believe it's out in

1746
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:44,360
Japan as well. Chaotic Eden for the PC will also be on the show floor, and a game called

1747
01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:51,680
Tongari Bushi To Maho No 365 Nichi on the DS. Your guess is as good as mine as to what

1748
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:57,480
that is. Ah, also showing a friendly company to Konami. Hudson will be showing some titles

1749
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:01,660
on the floor. Ah, some Wii titles that they'll be showing on the Tokyo Game Show floor. Fishing

1750
01:39:01,660 --> 01:39:08,040
Master World Tour. Marble Saga Kororimpa, so now it's another, it looks like a new Kororimpa

1751
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:13,080
game coming exclusively to the Wii. Ah, it's new levels, four person multiplayer gameplay

1752
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,720
apparently is going to be in this new game. You can actually use your Mii this time around.

1753
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,920
I'll tell you what, the first Kororimpa game, hours of entertainment by making the little

1754
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:24,920
marba, the panda ball, and changing the sound effects to the farting noise every time it

1755
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:31,500
would hit the wall. Ah, yes. That's what the game sounds like, it's hours of entertainment

1756
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:36,100
because we all are seven. At heart. Um, but here's the thing, now they've built like a

1757
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:40,200
story around it, because the first game was just kind of like, eh, just kind of go, but

1758
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:45,440
now just license Marble Madness for god's sake. Seriously, make a new Marble Madness

1759
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:49,480
game. I mean, come on, stop beating around the bush, just make a new Marble Madness game.

1760
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,740
Hold on though, hold on though, you've got to listen to this story, okay? Ah, in this

1761
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:57,060
game you are going to go on a quest with a character named Anthony the Ant, and Anthony

1762
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:02,760
the Ant is searching for the golden sunflower. And you guide Anthony's marble around the

1763
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:07,040
ant world and you get items that will help you reach the golden sunflower and you will

1764
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:13,360
help save Anthony's colony. Ah, also, many more dangering mazes, amazing widgets and

1765
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:20,440
gadgets to help your little ant friend out. Oh, oh, and one more thing, one more thing,

1766
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:25,720
Wii Connect 24 capability, you can make your own stages in edit mode. Kind of neat, huh?

1767
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:29,640
That's kind of neat. There you go. That's what the first game should have been. That's

1768
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:33,560
alright though, we forgive him. Hey, one more game to announce from Hudson that's going

1769
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:40,120
to be a Tokyo Game Show, not on the Wii, but on PlayStation Network, Bomberman Ultra. Bomberman

1770
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:45,880
Ultra 8 player multiplayer online, 14 different arenas, 4 player local gaming, you can customize

1771
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:51,800
your own Bomberman character, 50 different costumes, adding up to 150,000 possible combinations

1772
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:57,440
of which 149,000 probably look like shit. But there you have it, that's how they are

1773
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:02,400
selling the game. So it looks like pretty much what we got on the 360, a newer version

1774
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,080
or whatever, a different version is coming to the PlayStation Network, but pretty much

1775
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:09,760
the same type of game. I hope it's not what we got on 3, oh, yeah, the Xbox Live one,

1776
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,800
I'm sorry. It wasn't bad, it was certainly better in Bomberman 0. It was extreme! Yes,

1777
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:20,600
it was very extreme. There you have it, Konami and Hudson games to see at Tokyo Game Show.

1778
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,960
Have fun to those that are going, you lucky bastard. Send us pictures. Well, I think we

1779
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,160
have at least a couple listeners who are going. I do believe so, I've seen it around the Twitter,

1780
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:34,280
so I expect many pictures. There's actually certain things that I would like to see, but

1781
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:39,080
one that I'm actually very interested in that's only going to be a video only for PlayStation

1782
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:47,760
3 is the game that was, the new game done by the creator of Katamari Damacy, which is

1783
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:53,000
Keita Takahashi. It's called Nobi Nobi Boy, and really he just looks sort of green and

1784
01:41:53,000 --> 01:42:00,240
cylindrical with the prince face. It's like if they made it, you know, the Prince of the

1785
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:07,800
Cosmos or whatever with a wiener dog. I know, right. But I would love for someone to get

1786
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:12,640
out a video camera and tape me some footage of that, because we really, there hasn't been

1787
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:17,760
anything really specific out on it yet, except some people playing with something that looked

1788
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:22,860
like a dildo. And I will send you a dollar if you dress up your wiener dog like Nobi

1789
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:30,520
Nobi Boy for Halloween. One whole dollar? One whole dollar! That's pure US currency

1790
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:34,520
for you. There's also another game there that I want someone to tape me footage of so I

1791
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:43,080
can see it, and that's, um, don't laugh, Anpanmantotuch de Waku Waku Training. What is that? Anpanman.

1792
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:48,680
Huh. He's cute and made of bread. Alright. But just some stuff that's actually going

1793
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:57,440
to be video only is Nobi Nobi Boy Galaga Legends for, I'm sorry, Legions for Xbox 360. On Wii

1794
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:04,240
is One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Kotoba no Puzzle, Mojipitan Wii Deluxe, and Progolf

1795
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:12,320
for Saru. Doesn't Saru mean monkey? Anyway. On DS, the video only ones are Dr. Slump,

1796
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:17,760
Arale-chan, Dragon Ball Origins, and Anpanmantotuch de Waku Waku Training. Someone tape it for

1797
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:24,480
me. Um, we also have, um, on PSP, Idolmaster SP, Wandering Star, and Missing Moon. PlayStation

1798
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:29,760
2 is Super Robot Tyson Z, and PC, Legend of Galactic Heroes, which is pretty cool. There

1799
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:35,700
are some playable, uh, things though, things of interest. Like what? Like whatever Happy

1800
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:41,320
Dance Collection is, I guess? I don't know. Um, Soul Eater Medusa's Conspiracy. Soul Eater

1801
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:45,880
is a pretty freakin' cool manga, what I've seen of it. There's also, um, yes, Pre-Care

1802
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:53,640
Five Gogo Zen and Shugo Dream Carnival. Um, there's also, uh, some Tales of Heart stuff

1803
01:43:53,640 --> 01:44:01,280
going on. I really do want to see Macross Ace Frontier, and, um, there's also, uh, Tales

1804
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:10,200
of the Radiant World mythology too. Also on PSP. Alrighty. Well cool. What about, uh,

1805
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:18,240
Sega? Uh, it's just listed by systems. Oh, I'm sorry. That's alright. Okay. Well anyways,

1806
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:22,560
um, we've got some, uh, interesting information. Uh, big surprise, because they seem to be

1807
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:29,360
gobbling up all sorts of game store chains, but GameStop has now bought a brand new chain

1808
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:37,640
in France, uh, for 700 million dollars, and they have gained 332 stores out of the deal.

1809
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:44,600
And apparently, um, I don't know, the two stores that they, um, bought, I guess, uh,

1810
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:50,920
the Gaming Guild and its, um, Navigators. I guess those are a chain. Oh, Micromania,

1811
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:58,280
I'm sorry, is, uh, the French company. Micromania. Never heard of them, but of course I don't

1812
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:04,740
live in France, so. Isn't that kind of scary though? There's like, they're seriously trying

1813
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:11,960
to be like the McDonalds of fucking gaming. Uh, yeah, beware kids, um, you will be assimilated

1814
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:18,240
into the GameStop collective, apparently. It's just a matter of time. I don't know about

1815
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,360
you guys, but when I hear about GameStop taking over the world, it makes me a little bit angsty,

1816
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:27,440
especially for the independent shops out there. And when I get angsty, we play the mean music

1817
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:46,200
and say mean things. F.U.'s of the week time, Dark Sakura. And F.U. to me for forgetting

1818
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:50,960
one of the stories that I had to do just a moment ago. And F.U. to Rob for not actually

1819
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,720
telling me to do the story. I tried to drop a hint! Yeah, but I'm a little pissed off

1820
01:45:55,720 --> 01:46:07,120
right now. I'm a lot pissed off. Why? Because I need my... I hurt. Aww. So F.U. goes to

1821
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:16,840
my hip hurting like really, really freaking bad, and um, F.U. to uh, stuff in general.

1822
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:23,640
Damn that stuff. I know, stuff just sucks. Loki. F.U. to people that run red lights with

1823
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:29,800
their cars. Um, I don't know, they think it's fun or something? Or they just say, forget

1824
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:35,920
it, you know? Um, anyways, so yeah, they, there was a guy today, we're driving, and

1825
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:41,240
he just, you know, right turn on a red, and just kind of didn't even stop, just, woo!

1826
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:46,160
I'm going! And then he pulled right in front of me, and went super slow, just to add, you

1827
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:50,720
know, insult to injury. And then, um, you know, there's numerous days where I see people

1828
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:55,040
just blowing through red lights, like well after, you know, they've turned red, because

1829
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:59,600
they're in a hurry. Well good, I hope you murder somebody, and end up in jail forever,

1830
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:05,800
and sued, you know, for all the money that you have, all a few bucks of it, and um, you

1831
01:47:05,800 --> 01:47:12,760
rot in hell. That's it. Um, I wanna say F.U. to the Italian dinner I had last night, which

1832
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:17,620
was not at Olive Garden, I went to another place, um, around here, and um, man, I don't

1833
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:21,640
know what it was about the food, it was bad or something, because it's like World War

1834
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:30,160
3 was occurring in my colon. It was really, really horrible, so uh, F.U. to that. I wonder

1835
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:34,560
if I, like, ate uncooked meat or something, it was pretty terrible. I'm gonna do my story

1836
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:39,000
now. You sure can do your story now. Uh, this is the list of stuff that Sega's gonna have

1837
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:44,880
at Tokyo Game Show. Um, for Playstation 3 is Yakuza 3, Bayonetta, Sonic Unleashed. For

1838
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:51,880
Wii is 4.28, Bleach vs. Crusade, the arrangement of Haruhi Suzumiya, another Haruhi, oh, I

1839
01:47:51,880 --> 01:47:57,480
like Haruhi. That's really cool. Sonic Unleashed, Samba de Amigo, Xbox 360 is Bayonetta, Sonic

1840
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:02,920
Unleashed, DS is Mystery Dungeon, Shiro and the Wanderer, DS2, Demon Castle in the Desert,

1841
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:08,360
Phantasy Star Zero, which is gonna be awesome, Infinite Space, 7th Dragon, Shining Force

1842
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:13,440
Feather, that's another cool thing, Cold Accept DS, which actually someone IMed me the other

1843
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:19,320
day saying, look, Cold Accept! I'm like, I don't like tactics games. Cold Accept's neat

1844
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:25,200
though, cause it's like Monopoly meets, yeah, I like Cold Accept. Um, there's the Haruhi

1845
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:32,200
game, um, Blazer Drive, World Destruction, um, Sakatsuka DS Touch and Direct, Kaite Obe,

1846
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:41,600
oh, bleh, Kaite Oboeru Doragana, Doragana, Doragana. Okay. Garnet Chronicle, um, Crimson

1847
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:48,080
Jen, Saigon PSP, Hatsune Miku, Project Diva, you know what that is, right? What? Virtual

1848
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:55,400
Idol. Nice. Yep. And Phantasy Star Portable, and PC is getting Internet Adventure. Internet

1849
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:59,560
Adventure? The Internet is an adventure. It is an adventure. Dude, that's okay, I want

1850
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:05,300
the Hatsune Miku game. I totally want the Hatsune Miku game. Alright. Lots to look forward

1851
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:12,720
to a Tokyo game show. Rob, we'll have to play some of the Vocaloid for people who don't

1852
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:16,280
know what it is. Someday. That's why we have a Justin TV channel. Hey, uh, other games

1853
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:19,840
coming out in the US, kinda coming away from Japan, coming back to the US, well I imagine

1854
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,840
this game will come out in Japan as well at some point, but, we're getting it in the US

1855
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,240
first, it's Fable 2, and a follow up to a story we had last week, remember how we talked

1856
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:32,200
about that the co-op was gonna be delayed via a patch? Well, suddenly there's some backtracking

1857
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:39,200
this week from the infamous Peter Molyneux, the Lionhead CEO, he is saying that the co-op

1858
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:44,460
actually might be available at launch day. So now they're kinda going back and forth,

1859
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:49,160
but this was said at some video at a game festival that was going on in Paris, he said

1860
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:55,680
that Fable 2 will have the online co-op at launch, but he can't confirm that. But the

1861
01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:02,840
ambition is there, but just in case we prepare for disappointment. I'm not sure how exactly

1862
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:05,960
I'm supposed to take that. It's only about a week of disappointment. I know, it'll be

1863
01:50:05,960 --> 01:50:09,840
all over within a week, which quite frankly I have enough games to play anyway, I don't

1864
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,920
fuckin' need another one, but, I do still kinda want Fable 2, I gotta admit. You need

1865
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,160
to play Saints Row 2. No I don't. Cause you can make all sorts of tranny characters and

1866
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:22,000
like- Oh, cause that's why I play games, Loki, to make tranny characters. Exactly! Who doesn't

1867
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,720
play games? That was a sexist comment. How was that sexist comment? Tranny is both sexist.

1868
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:38,320
Cause you're- Fable 2 is getting a collector's edition, but it's slowly slipping away. Some

1869
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:43,600
of the cards that were supposed to be in it, the figure and all this stuff, the box itself

1870
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:48,640
is not actually going to be there. Oh, but the cards will. The cards will be there. But

1871
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:55,280
here's the other weird thing. The cards are going to be there in a downloadable PDF format.

1872
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:00,640
So you can print your own damn cards. I'm getting the feeling nobody pre-ordered the

1873
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:03,760
collector's edition and that's why they're suddenly having to do this. I don't know what

1874
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:09,720
it is. Did you? Yeah. How do you feel about the fact that it's suddenly like, disappearing?

1875
01:51:09,720 --> 01:51:14,360
I didn't give a shit about the cards or the DVD or anything, I just wanted like, the extra

1876
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:18,640
weapons in it and stuff. And even then, you know, the only reason I'm buying it is because

1877
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:24,000
I get a kickass discount, so it actually doesn't really cost me that much. You know, it's actually

1878
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,400
cheaper than buying the retail version of the game. So wait a minute, even though you

1879
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:31,540
were yelling at me to make trannies in Saints Row, you were actually going to be leaving

1880
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:36,880
for a while to play Fable 2? No, I'm buying it now so I can play it after I'm doing Saints

1881
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:41,660
Row 2, which will be for a while. My friend wants to play Fable 2 co-op, so you know,

1882
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:45,200
that'd sound kinda like fun. That'd be fun. But then again, I want to play Saints Row

1883
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:50,880
2 co-op, so I don't know. HendersonMam says, I wanted the Master Chief Outlet. Is that

1884
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:54,900
the thing they're getting with the pre-order? Yes, that comes with the pre-order still.

1885
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:59,240
There's like a lightsaber type of weapon or something that you get. There's also like

1886
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:05,320
some additional dungeon or something that's coming. That's about it, and you get like

1887
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:09,320
a bonus DVD with behind the scenes crap. I kinda wanted the figurine for my desk, and

1888
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:13,120
that would've been kinda cool. I also have a regular version on order as well in case

1889
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:17,680
I decide last minute I don't want, you know. Well, I have it on order at work. I mean,

1890
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:23,080
I can cancel at any time. There's no $5 deposit for me, so. Cancel at any time. That's right.

1891
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:26,200
Why don't you order like 50 of them and then cancel them all? Or will they get mad? They

1892
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:31,640
get mad at that. Oh, I see. Alright. Well, that is coming out soon. Hey, speaking of

1893
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:36,420
the Master Chief Outfit, completely random off-topic story. I went to a party store here

1894
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:40,760
locally yesterday, and you know everybody's gearing up for Halloween, right? Did you know

1895
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:46,120
they're selling a Halo 3 branded Master Chief Outfit? Have you seen that? I have seen that.

1896
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:49,920
As something else. I was at a party store yesterday. Do you know what's really sad is

1897
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:54,080
I was considering buying it, because I'm kinda pathetic. No. Well, it would be fun, wouldn't

1898
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:59,440
it? No. Dressed up as a video game character? Especially one as well known as Master Chief?

1899
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:05,260
What? Um, what? Um. You know tons of cosplayers, you wouldn't have a problem. True. I could

1900
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:09,680
save that for an Iron Man convention. Our manager in Dallas, he has a kick-ass Halo.

1901
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:14,760
I think he actually bought one of those Halo costumes, like a custom-made one or something.

1902
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:19,840
He has, like, literally the full outfit. Rob should go as the, um, the king of the universe.

1903
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,520
Uh, Deep Man. Oh, the king of the cosmos? That'd be hilarious. Actually, we're talking

1904
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:26,680
about doing that as a Rocky Horror Gold scene at some point, if you even know what I'm talking

1905
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:32,240
about. Um, Deep Man in chat, uh, live in our chatroom, chat.orangemanstrategy.com says,

1906
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:38,080
uh, I saw that at Walmart yesterday here in Canada. So it's even at Walmart. Dan Shadow's

1907
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:42,280
gonna be Dr. Horrible. That's a pretty good outfit. You know what I'm hearing is gonna

1908
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:47,760
be a really popular outfit this year, I heard? Uh, Sarah Palin. I wouldn't doubt it. One

1909
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:52,320
of my friends is going to Sarah. Uh, Deep Man says a lot of people won't cancel it regardless,

1910
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:59,320
going back to the pre-order, speaking of that. There you go. Alright, so, Fable 2. I'll buy

1911
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:03,080
it. It'll just be one of those games I only have 30 minutes to play. So, go figure. Oh,

1912
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:08,160
Deep Man says my wife is going as Grunty from Banjo-Kazooie. You know what I saw as someone

1913
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:13,240
made a costume or released a, uh, a guide on how to make it? They have a Sackboy costume

1914
01:54:13,240 --> 01:54:17,120
that someone made. Oh my. Oh yeah, I saw that. I saw that. I think I might actually want

1915
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:21,800
to make that. That's cool. I don't have a costume to wear, and, uh, my wife is dressing

1916
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:32,200
up as Darthina Vaderina, the, um, pink, Barbie-ish, secret girlfriend of Darth Vader. She's going

1917
01:54:32,200 --> 01:54:39,600
as Awful Mary Sue. It's, she's literally like, you know, um, she's dressing, or, it kinda

1918
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:45,720
looks like, uh, like her cape's gonna be bedazzled and stuff like that. It's, it's ridiculous,

1919
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:50,040
but, uh, funny. SSJ100Matt says I'm thinking of going as the Hebrew Hammer. That would

1920
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:53,200
be funny. We'll have to ask this question again on our Twitter or something right before

1921
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:57,400
Halloween. You know what? What? If, if I, if it wasn't so freakin' hot to wear and didn't

1922
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:02,480
need to be, uh, taken in a bit, I'd wear my Organization 13 costume from YALIcon the other

1923
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:06,200
year. I'm probably gonna recycle my Jack Skellington costume from last year, cuz seriously, I paid

1924
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:09,440
good money for it. I need to wear it more than once. You know, I actually, though, I

1925
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:14,080
really want someone, I, I need to redo the claw. I could do my bike-in costume. Oh, fun.

1926
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,840
Show off my boobs. Alright. Not really. How about you show off the next gaming story?

1927
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:24,840
How about I do just that? How about you do it. Um, well, for anyone who's been interested

1928
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:31,840
in The Force Unleashed, you're getting some treats. You're getting, um, Luke and Obi-Wan,

1929
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:38,240
which is pretty freakin' cool. You're also getting, um, uh, Ki-Adi-Mundi and Kit Fisto.

1930
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:46,840
That sounds like a porn star name. Um, Kit Fisto! Fisting. Wow. It's actually a pretty

1931
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:54,540
cool-looking character. Um, but also, um, there's supposed to be, um, new costumes and

1932
01:55:54,540 --> 01:56:00,680
a new mission, um, one for the Jedi Temple, and the, uh, apprentice will learn more about

1933
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:06,640
his father, blah blah blah. Um, so you get more, uh, stuff. There's no dates left for

1934
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:14,000
the, for the download content packs, but, um, it will be posted at some point, I guess.

1935
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:18,960
Pretty game. Yeah, that, that Sackboy costume looks really easy to make. It's like a sweatshirt

1936
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:24,320
in a garbage bag, or a garbage pail. You should wear a Kit Fisto costume. I'm not gonna wear

1937
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:27,440
a Kit Fisto costume, but see, look at that. It just makes the head. Isn't that kinda cool?

1938
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:31,120
That's cool. No, I saw that on, uh, bloggers in the last week. I'm gonna do that. Totally

1939
01:56:31,120 --> 01:56:34,560
gonna do that. I still think you should be Kit Fisto. What's Kit Fisto? I don't know,

1940
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:41,240
it's just a funny name. Yeah, you're right, that is funny. Kit Fisto. Fisto. Fisto Ophirio.

1941
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:51,400
Fisto, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. Next story. So, uh, yeah. Apparently all that drama with,

1942
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:58,000
uh, EA trying to buy Take-Two is made Take-Two say, hey, you know what? We're just gonna

1943
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:03,240
be a bachelor for a long time. How about that? So they've decided that they're not going

1944
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:08,640
to... We need a little me time. They're not gonna mate with any other game companies right

1945
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:13,600
now, or merge with any of them. They're not gonna return your phone calls. They're not

1946
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,360
calling you back, they're like, you know... They just want the one night stand, they're

1947
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:23,080
gonna go, bye! They're like, it's not you, it's you. They're like, you know, when they're

1948
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:27,040
getting up in the morning and, you know, whoever they're in bed with is saying, call me, you

1949
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:34,480
know, Take-Two's just like, sure, yeah, I'll do that. I'll call you something. Alright,

1950
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,960
well, too bad for those that were interested in Take-Two, I suppose, but, you know, good

1951
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:42,080
for them, I guess, sticking to it, if they want to stay independent. Hey, on completely

1952
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:46,320
different news, this is a game, another, god, another freaking game I want to get this year,

1953
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:50,720
I'm just not gonna have time for. The Last Remnant. The Last Remnant, you know, it's coming

1954
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:55,860
out worldwide. Japan, of course, one place that they really need to sell more Xbox 360s,

1955
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:58,440
even though, you know, they've had a lot of good luck and some turnaround, thanks to Tales

1956
01:57:58,440 --> 01:58:02,240
of Vesperia. They're gonna try to do that even more with The Last Remnant. It's a special

1957
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:07,920
Xbox 360 bundle that's gonna be coming out in Japan. This box is gonna come with a different

1958
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:14,920
DVD remote, the game, a face plate, and a soundtrack CD. That's $331 for all that shit

1959
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:19,440
together. It's about $30 off of what it would cost separately. And they're hoping that's

1960
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:24,120
gonna push them over the million Xbox 360s sold in Japan, Mark, because that's pretty

1961
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:28,880
big. And, you know, again, Tales of Vesperia has been very good at helping them get there.

1962
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:33,440
A little bit infinite on discovery, too, as well. So, The Last Remnant, by the way, though,

1963
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:37,680
is not, I should kind of step back a little bit, is not solely on the Xbox 360. It will

1964
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:42,680
be coming out on the PlayStation 3, but later. So, Xbox 360 does get a little bit of an exclusive

1965
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:48,800
window. So, there you go. That's a lot of stuff, too. Yep. So, if you're waiting in

1966
01:58:48,800 --> 01:58:53,480
Japan, now might be a good time. All right, now's a good time for us to go and open the

1967
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:58,920
email bag. Every week, you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we

1968
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:02,000
pick a few of our favorites to read here on the program, and that's what we're gonna do

1969
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,080
right now. Dark Soccer's gonna dive in the mailbag and read some emails. How many emails

1970
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:12,400
do we have tonight? Five. Five? Very on. All right. Let's make it quick. Five emails. Here

1971
01:59:12,400 --> 01:59:18,200
we go. Okay. The first one comes from Daniel. I swear this is going to be my last email

1972
01:59:18,200 --> 01:59:22,840
regarding Warhammer Online. I'm calling all MMO gamers to join the order on the Iron Fist

1973
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:30,840
server. I'm trying to get a guild together, but because the hours I work 2 p.m. until

1974
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:33,960
11 p.m. Monday through Saturday, thank you for telling us your hours. I will find out

1975
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,880
where you work. Um, it's becoming difficult. I have a close group of experienced MMO gamers

1976
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:48,000
on the server already, but we have all worked similar hours, so none of us are in-game during

1977
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:53,560
peak hours. The game really requires you to be in a guild to get some extra bonuses. p.m.

1978
01:59:53,560 --> 02:00:16,000
Ball Hair with three L's. Okay, it's B-A-L-L-L-H-A-I-R. Or, Punky Dunch if interested. I like how these

1979
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:22,360
guys are sending us an email about, look, we're on this roleplay server and we really

1980
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:29,320
want our guild to be taken seriously. We can't figure out why people won't join our guild

1981
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:34,680
and play this game with us. Maybe it's our work hours. I don't know. Please send a message

1982
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:50,840
to Ball Hair. Rob is turning red in the face. This is cute. Rob. Look. Rob. I'm not. Rob.

1983
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:58,800
Punky Dunch. That one's funny, too. Do you think that person might have just made this

1984
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,600
whole story up just to get us to say those names on here? I think possibly that whole

1985
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:08,160
thing was a trap to get you to say Ball Hair. You know what? I'll say Ball Hair anyway.

1986
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:19,400
Ball Hair! I'll also say Sweaty Balls. Alright. I am not afraid to go there, Rob. Alright.

1987
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:25,480
I know. You live there. You own a house there. P.S. LittleBigPlanet is insane. On the surface

1988
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:30,000
it's a cute platformer but once you dive into the level builder you will be hooked. It is

1989
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,920
difficult but addictive. One of my favorite things about it is the ability to borrow someone's

1990
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:38,120
creations. If someone else makes a really cool figure or building you can borrow it

1991
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:42,120
and put it on your own stages. Look on YouTube for some really cool creations. The Body Level

1992
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:49,040
and Little Big Colossus are some of the more popular levels out there. That's from Daniel.

1993
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:55,800
A.K.A. Ball Hair. Dan's in chat right now and says, no, it's real, I swear. So you should

1994
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:59,840
sign all your letters, Ball Hair. He is Ball Hair the Dwarf. Ball Hair. He says, come on,

1995
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:04,800
it's awesome. No, dude, it is awesome. That's the whole thing. It's just really funny. I'm

1996
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,480
sorry just because the whole setup of the email and everything. So we have to have fan

1997
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:19,840
fear for you to go, Ball Hair the Dwarf. Can I move on? Yes. Hi folks. I just had a few

1998
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:26,720
questions for you. Maybe you might have some possible answers and slash or feedback. Considering

1999
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:31,440
how retro gaming is on consoles nowadays as well as indie games, see Everyday Shooter,

2000
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:37,280
Mega Man 9, XNA, etc. for reference. I have decided to make my own games for both the

2001
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:42,440
360 and PS3. The catch is the last game I made was a borderline pornographic mod of

2002
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:49,440
an Apple IIe edutainment game originally called Turtle Trot. Excuse me. What classes should

2003
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:53,080
I take or alternatively, what books should I read and what programming languages should

2004
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,760
I learn? Are most games using the C languages or a variation thereof? Dude, I have no fucking

2005
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:04,120
clue. To actually learn how to write games? You should write them in BASIC. You know what

2006
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:09,080
everybody does? And release it on the TI computer. Actually, that's not a bad point to the email

2007
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:13,080
because I'll tell you, when I was in school studying computer science, C++ was where you

2008
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:16,360
started. It's one of those things where you have to start somewhere. I mean, programming

2009
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:21,960
languages aren't that much different. I mean, they are and they aren't. I mean, the way

2010
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:28,920
you learn, shut up. The way you learn languages is that whole logic if then and building flow

2011
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:33,600
charts in your mind. And any language is going to be a foot in the door at that. But if you

2012
02:03:33,600 --> 02:03:39,200
want something to be practical and learn something, you go with C or the languages that are really

2013
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:47,440
out there. Rob, I have to say something. What's that? Yeah, my flow chart is in my mind. There

2014
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:53,980
you go. As for the rest of the email? Yes. In case you're wondering, I'm looking to develop

2015
02:03:53,980 --> 02:03:58,480
games that have the look and feel of old school 8 and 16 bit arcade and console games. This

2016
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:04,320
catch is that A, they're simple to pick up and learn, B, difficult to master, C, fun,

2017
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:08,920
and D, they have my goofy corny off the wall sense of humor injected into them. An example

2018
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:12,640
would be an NPC in an adventure game complaining about being forced to pace back and forth

2019
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:17,000
in a certain path and saying the same thing over and over again to Avengers. In a fit

2020
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,760
of rage or fed up, he declares that he quits and orders the gaming gods to take his job

2021
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:28,420
and shove it. That came from Spazinator, by the way. Wait, what was the question in there?

2022
02:04:28,420 --> 02:04:32,240
What games have that type of... That's what he said is goals for making the games. Oh,

2023
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:38,500
I see. I don't know, Loki, you're probably the closest thing we have on staff to a programmer.

2024
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:43,460
What are your thoughts on this? For someone that doesn't program, I'm pretty good with...

2025
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:47,320
You hack and stuff, but I don't know. Do you have any thoughts on this? He hacks with a

2026
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:53,200
butter knife. Well, I mean, if you're trying to get into it professionally, I guess, then

2027
02:04:53,200 --> 02:05:01,360
C would be good or Visual Basic or something like that. Probably, if you're just doing

2028
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:07,840
it for fun and you want to do something like that, there's Game Maker 7. I don't know if

2029
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:12,520
you've seen, there was that Mario game that had the Mega Man levels and all that crazy

2030
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:16,720
shit in it. That was made with Game Maker 7. So you can actually make full games out

2031
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:20,640
of it and distribute them to your friends and that kind of thing. And that's what you're

2032
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:28,920
interested in doing. But yeah, that's pretty much it. That's Bobby. I don't know. Good

2033
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:34,560
luck to you. Pass off the blame. Next email? Yes, next email. Hello, cast of OLR, especially

2034
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:39,200
Loki. I just wanted to tell the listeners and you guys about something cool for the

2035
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:42,620
PC, which I've read this email and we pretty much know about. First of all, I'm sure Loki

2036
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:47,200
has heard about Fretz on Fire. It's a free Guitar Hero game for the PC. If you have an

2037
02:05:47,200 --> 02:05:51,160
Xbox 360, you can plug in your wired controller into your computer, download a driver for

2038
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,280
it, and play this game just like Guitar Hero 3. Also, the wireless ones work too. You just

2039
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:59,880
have to buy a special wireless receiver for your computer. If you have a Guitar Hero controller

2040
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:03,240
for PS2 and other systems that's wired, you can get a converter that will allow you to

2041
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:12,040
plug in these controllers and play. Lastly, if you decide to get this game, at first it

2042
02:06:12,040 --> 02:06:17,480
sucks because the game itself has a lot of bugs, which makes it bad, and it looks nothing

2043
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:22,220
like Guitar Hero 3, but if you get it, download the Olarian mod because it's designed to make

2044
02:06:22,220 --> 02:06:25,720
it look and feel just like Guitar Hero 3. The best thing about this game is that you

2045
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:30,320
can add your own songs and download ones made by other people. Lastly, all of the real gaming

2046
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:35,200
companies like Activision and Harmonix have released song packs for each of their games

2047
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:39,480
that are exactly the same as the real ones. That makes me laugh because Guitar Hero 3

2048
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:43,080
is on PC, but you can just download the songs for Fronts on Fire and play them for free,

2049
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:47,440
so please check it out. This is from Blade 3. It's basically like StepMania, but for

2050
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:52,680
Guitar Hero. PS, sorry this email is so long, thanks for reading it. PSS, I hope I passed

2051
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:57,280
the Grammar Nazis test. No, you didn't because you didn't fluctuate that sentence, and the

2052
02:06:57,280 --> 02:07:02,280
last one was run on sentence, and also Nazi is spelled N-A-Z-I, but not with a T. They

2053
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:06,520
also have a game called Guitar Fun on the Wii that's basically the same thing, and you

2054
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:11,360
can use that for like home brew stuff, plus now the new version has USB support, so you

2055
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:19,080
can use your USB guitars, I think for Rock Band, and then you can also use USB keyboards

2056
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:23,040
if you want to, and that's also available, and I think you can do two player on that.

2057
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:29,240
You can also do playing over the internet with that game as well, Guitar Fun, so that's

2058
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:33,840
kind of cool, and I think Fronts on Fire can do the same thing, but yeah, I mean it's got

2059
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:37,640
a big community, they've got all the Rock Band songs, all the Guitar Hero songs available

2060
02:07:37,640 --> 02:07:42,640
to download in packs and stuff, so if you like, you know, StepMania, and you're now

2061
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:49,560
moving on from DDR to Guitar Hero, this is probably something you'll be interested in.

2062
02:07:49,560 --> 02:07:56,680
May I continue? You may. I shall. Hello, this is Hephaestus in chat. When the time zones

2063
02:07:56,680 --> 02:08:01,440
align themselves appropriately, I have a bone to pick. Two games came out this past week

2064
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:06,160
that I'm totally into and have heard zero mention of them. Pipe Mania, which I recognize

2065
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:10,880
is a remake of the Game Boy game that I played incessantly, and My Boyfriend. Wait, is that

2066
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,960
the old, old-ass game? It's the one I mentioned, no, I mentioned this last week, yes, it's

2067
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:19,040
a remake of Pipe Dream. Okay, I was gonna say, that game is like, god, they had the

2068
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:23,840
game on the Commodore 64, that shit is old school. I mean, it's a very simple puzzle,

2069
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:31,240
it's like Tetris. It's also like Bioshock's hacking. Ah, yes, yes, it is. Well, to continue?

2070
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:37,000
Sorry. Um, I'd never heard of the video game My Boyfriend, but it came out this week. I'm

2071
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:41,480
sure it can't be as bad as Imagine Babies or whatever horrible crime against grammar

2072
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:45,880
Ubisoft perpetrated against the English language while concocting the spelling of that game's

2073
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:50,720
name, and yes, she did spell it correctly. And regardless, the game is called My Boyfriend

2074
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:56,380
and apparently the game lets the player as a teenage girl have her first boyfriend. Now

2075
02:08:56,380 --> 02:09:00,160
that I haven't heard of. Maybe I can play as a boy, and that would make it the most

2076
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:04,640
awesome game ever. While your news is usually awesome and definitely entertaining to listen

2077
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:09,040
to, I just wanted to point out these two horrible omissions in your release sources. Thanks,

2078
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:14,500
Hephaestus. I mentioned Pipe Mania last time we did releases, and yes, I did mention the

2079
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:18,560
exact same stuff. It's a remake of Pipe Dream, and it's the same thing as like the hacking

2080
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:22,040
in it. I remember specifically saying that, because I have to sell this crap, so. I think

2081
02:09:22,040 --> 02:09:26,440
I kinda wanna play that one though, because it makes me think of Tokimeki Girlside. Well,

2082
02:09:26,440 --> 02:09:30,400
if you wanna, let's see, if you wanna, whether games or people are gonna accuse me of forgetting

2083
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:36,040
to mention Gravity, which is a game that's gonna be coming out that's kinda like the,

2084
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:42,520
was it Pocket Physics game that's out now? Dude, that sounds cool. There's also. I like

2085
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:46,280
physics. There's also a crappy Rubik's World game that's coming out later on that's like

2086
02:09:46,280 --> 02:09:51,560
Rubik's Cube stuff, but they're trying to make it like expanded and it's gonna be like

2087
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:58,440
a puzzle game and stuff. I'm trying to think of what else that people might be remotely

2088
02:09:58,440 --> 02:10:02,280
interested in. Rubik's Cube yourself by peeling off the stickers. I don't know, I just mentioned

2089
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:07,220
everything. You know, I don't miss a thing. Hephaestus is in chat right now and says,

2090
02:10:07,220 --> 02:10:11,120
by the way, my boyfriend is totally a bad GTA clone. Didn't we, I wanna say there was

2091
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:14,800
a story about this a long, long time ago on the show, like when it was in development.

2092
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:18,400
Yeah. Okay, yeah, sorry. The company that made my boyfriend apparently also made a PC

2093
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:24,000
game called So Blonde. I did, I wanna say it came up a long time ago. Yeah, I do remember

2094
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:27,520
that. There was something, cause we were making fun of it and almost the same jokes are coming

2095
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,600
up now, like Frisbee says in the game, you can make sandwiches. That's how you get a

2096
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:37,280
boyfriend, cook him something. Isn't that right, DarkSakura? Dude, I found my man on

2097
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:42,120
the internet. I downloaded him. And then I had to fly out here and now I have to put

2098
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:46,480
up with him every day. And us now. Cause if you had moved out here, you would never have

2099
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,600
met me. If not for, if not for my husband, I would never have been the internet celebrity

2100
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:56,920
I am today. There you go. Or Zach Deft calls him Edan. He facilitates my rock and roll

2101
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:04,760
lifestyle. Or lack thereof. So, last email? Yes, last email. Dear OLR. Oh, we're dear.

2102
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:08,260
I would just like to say that yesterday's show, the 28th, was my first time listening

2103
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:14,080
live while interacting with the chat room. I had previously listened live on one other

2104
02:11:14,080 --> 02:11:18,400
occasion. I would just like to say that the whole experience of listening live while chatting

2105
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:23,360
with the OLR listeners takes this amazing show to a whole new level. It really is something

2106
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:26,920
every listener should experience because it's so unique and makes the show that much more

2107
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:31,760
fun and interactive. If this gets read on air, this statement needs to be made. If you

2108
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:36,400
love the podcast and only listen via the podcast, you're doing yourself a disservice by not

2109
02:11:36,400 --> 02:11:41,520
experiencing all the OLR has to offer. There's also some post-show goodness to be found on

2110
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:45,440
occasion, which is definitely also worth your time. Well, thank you. God, you'd think we'd

2111
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:48,880
paid somebody to write that. That's very sweet. I know we didn't because we don't have any

2112
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:55,760
money. Exactly. We used that all up in Seattle. At the risk of sounding like a complete suck-up,

2113
02:11:55,760 --> 02:12:02,400
I'm going to end the email, but first, I would just like to remind the OLR staff how awesome

2114
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:07,220
they are and reiterate that every listener should go to the chat room sometime. I know

2115
02:12:07,220 --> 02:12:11,240
I will be listening live and chatting every week that I'm able, so here's hoping everyone

2116
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:18,060
listens live, SonicM88. By the way, I have to commend your spelling and your grammar.

2117
02:12:18,060 --> 02:12:24,400
It's beautiful. It's freaking gorgeous. A rare compliment. See, that's how you get dark

2118
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:29,320
soccer to kiss your ass is kiss her ass. Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I actually

2119
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:33,880
because you know, I'm used to, and I, I, it's kind of hard. I don't catch it for so much

2120
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:37,400
of myself, but I catch it in other people's writing because I've gotten kind of used to

2121
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:43,640
being the beta reader, but, um, wow. This is actually very, very well done. Thank you.

2122
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:46,840
Um, my face is actually actually good. Good question. Chat. What about whatever happened

2123
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:51,080
to the midday show for the European listeners? We still need to do that. So probably it's

2124
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:55,920
not probably realistically not going to happen until after 300 and I don't know how much

2125
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,080
I want to get into this now until I know some details, but, um, I'm going to be off for

2126
02:13:00,080 --> 02:13:04,640
like several shows in a row because I'm having surgery. If you've been listening to the show,

2127
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:09,800
I just don't know when the, when is the big question. I'm having a pancreas. No, I not.

2128
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:15,520
I, well, no, he's having a duodenum ectomy, but if I get the gallbladder out, which is

2129
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:21,680
having a stomach, shut up. I'm getting a face job. Uh, but no, I'm going to have the gallbladder

2130
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:24,400
out, which is very common. I'm sure plenty of our listeners have had it done. I'm not

2131
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:27,240
that worried about it except for the fact that it's just surgery, but you know, there's

2132
02:13:27,240 --> 02:13:30,760
going to be a recovery time and I have no OLR for me while I'm recovering. So probably

2133
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:34,080
at least two, if not three weeks, I'm going to be out. Um, so I don't know what's going

2134
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:40,000
to happen to the show during that time. Oh, Jesus Christ. But, um, yeah, something will

2135
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:44,400
have to buy. I'm not missing episode 300. We will put this damn show on hiatus at two

2136
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:48,540
99 if I'm having the surgery in two weeks, which I don't think I am. Well, we'll figure

2137
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:51,760
out something. We'll figure something out. We always do. We'll bring the computer in

2138
02:13:51,760 --> 02:13:58,160
to Rob's bedside, live from surgery, live from my bedroom. We'll put your surgery on

2139
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:03,200
Justin TV. That would be just, it would be almost Shakespearean to have episode 300 from

2140
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:11,480
the hospital. I don't know why. We should, we should, we should totally seriously webcast

2141
02:14:11,480 --> 02:14:17,360
your surgery. I'm not Katie Couric for fuck's sake. All right. Seg says need a guest host.

2142
02:14:17,360 --> 02:14:21,520
Well, we always, we always want guests. So come up, be on the show. I think Bobby should

2143
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:26,000
fly out here. All right. So that's, that's the end of the segment tonight. Yes. For the

2144
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,360
mailbag. Yes. All right. We want to thank our sponsor for tonight. Let's fly Ciara back

2145
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:33,960
out here. We want to thank tonight's sponsor for our mailbag segment is going to be our

2146
02:14:33,960 --> 02:15:01,560
guest host. Give it up for tonight's sponsor. Everybody. I don't get it. No, just kidding.

2147
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:05,000
I do get it. All right, good. I was going to say, don't make me explain it to you. All

2148
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,920
right, let's move on to a couple more gaming news stories and we're going to open up the

2149
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:15,320
Skype line and hopefully we'll get some calls. So there's plenty of ways to save money with

2150
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:20,000
your car insurance, but there may be a new way soon, especially if you're of the old

2151
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:31,560
variety. Apparently there is Allstate and they're I guess testing a new, I guess a new

2152
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:38,200
video game product for PCs that they're going to give to 100,000 customers in Pennsylvania

2153
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:45,120
between the ages of 50 and 75. The games are basically different tests. Kind of think of

2154
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:53,260
like almost like brain training a little bit. They test for visual alertness and also kind

2155
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:59,320
of just different reflex tests and that kind of stuff. And they're seeing if the performance

2156
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:04,760
in that game correlates to how safe the drivers are. And if they find that to be true, then

2157
02:16:04,760 --> 02:16:10,160
you may get, you know, discounts based on how well you perform in a game or how often

2158
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:16,320
you play said game. I hope they do the tests on Crazy Taxi. Crazy Taxi? That'd be awesome.

2159
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:24,160
Are you ready to save some crazy money? That's like a future Geico commercial right there.

2160
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:30,760
Wow, who knew some video games might actually save me money in the future? Do you think

2161
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:34,600
this is really going to happen though or is this like one of the things where like so

2162
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:38,920
and so says something to so and so and now it's like fact? It's less of a game, more

2163
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:46,160
of like software. I wouldn't even call it a game. All right. Hey, we are going to be

2164
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:52,880
opening the Skype line very soon to your calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is

2165
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:58,040
Orange Lounge Radio. So you definitely should be adding us on there. But first, we have

2166
02:16:58,040 --> 02:17:04,320
one more story for you tonight about what else? The most important video game of the

2167
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:16,840
21st century. Of course, I mean SingStar ABBA. It is being released on December 2nd and the

2168
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:21,800
track listings have been announced. There are going to be 20 tracks on the PlayStation

2169
02:17:21,800 --> 02:17:32,200
2 for $30, 25 tracks on the PlayStation 3 for $40. And yes, Dancing Queens on both.

2170
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:37,040
Some of the highlights from both track lists, Chiquiquita, Gimme Gimme Gimme a Man After

2171
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:44,920
Midnight, Take a Chance on Me, SOS, Dancing Queen, Fernando, I Do I Do I Do, Knowing Me

2172
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:50,040
Knowing You, The Winner Takes It All, Mamma Mia, Money Money Money, and of course, Waterloo.

2173
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:54,120
Some of the exclusives on the PlayStation 3 that you will not see on the PlayStation

2174
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:59,380
2, if you were curious, I know I was, Under Attack, When All is Said and Done, which by

2175
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:04,200
the way is my favorite ABBA song ever, and Head Over Heels, and Happy New Year, and The

2176
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:10,300
Day Before You Came are the five. So that goes out to all two of you that care about

2177
02:18:10,300 --> 02:18:15,800
that news. But I'm telling you, this game is going to be epic in so many ways. I care

2178
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:22,080
too. Rob, when's it coming out in the US? December 2nd. You know what, Rob? I might

2179
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:28,840
have to pick it up. I'm going to pick it up. You already know, my PlayStation 3, I told

2180
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:35,720
America, and the world, I told the world, not just America, I told the world, I will

2181
02:18:35,720 --> 02:18:41,220
buy the PlayStation 3 when that one game comes out that I have to have. And it is coming

2182
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:45,280
December 2nd. It's not even Final Fantasy. Well, there's Little Big Planet 2, but there's

2183
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:49,360
Sing Star ABBA. See, you're going to come play that at my house too. This is a life

2184
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:54,520
or death scenario. I better be better from surgery by the time Sing Star ABBA comes out.

2185
02:18:54,520 --> 02:19:01,020
My surgery is scheduled for December 2nd. God hates me. That's what it is. And the chat

2186
02:19:01,020 --> 02:19:09,280
room is demanding a Justin TV special. I can't speak for Dark Sakura, and I certainly can't

2187
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:16,980
speak for Loki. Yes, you can. And Loki says no. But I will do a Justin TV special even

2188
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:21,400
if I have to get my fabulous friends over here to play the game with me, like Extifer,

2189
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:27,680
and Irene, and Victoria, and some of the fabulous friends. Get me drunk enough, I'll do it.

2190
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:31,920
Now, Deep Man asks a good point. Why can't these just be DLC for the current Sing Star?

2191
02:19:31,920 --> 02:19:38,040
That actually isn't a bad question. But something as momentous as ABBA deserves its own release.

2192
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:43,820
Don't you think? I mean, shit. If a little podunk band like ACDC, a little band that

2193
02:19:43,820 --> 02:19:50,960
nobody's heard of called Aerosmith, this no-name thing out of the Bay Area named Metallica,

2194
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:56,840
if they can all get their games, why can't ABBA have their own damn game? I still have

2195
02:19:56,840 --> 02:20:03,000
to give you your record. Yes, you do. When Ron Mo is here, he got Rob an ABBA album.

2196
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,840
That's amazing, by the way. Got him Super Trooper. That's amazing. That's what's going

2197
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:12,920
in the blank spot. Um, pinball. Alright. Maybe we'll just rearrange. I mean, some of these,

2198
02:20:12,920 --> 02:20:16,680
I mean, Pop'n Music 11. How old is that? I can come now. That is still cute. You should

2199
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:20,120
give that to me. The other one is Autograph. You know this Dear Friends poster? I don't

2200
02:20:20,120 --> 02:20:23,440
know if it comes through on Just TV, but there's no Bully Motz's autograph right there. That's

2201
02:20:23,440 --> 02:20:26,960
something my friends got me. I should put my Gorillaz poster up there. Maybe you should.

2202
02:20:26,960 --> 02:20:31,200
Alright, let's go to the phones and take some calls. Hey, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2203
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:36,000
Who's this? Hey, it's Ron Mo again. What's up, everyone? Hey, Ron Mo. Ron Mo, what's

2204
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:45,000
your favorite ABBA song? I don't have one. What? Get off my show! I'm just kidding. Hey!

2205
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,800
I'm just kidding. You better find one before December 2nd. Alright, no, just kidding. What's

2206
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:53,840
on your mind for real, DJ Ron Mo? Something different. I want everyone's opinion in the

2207
02:20:53,840 --> 02:21:00,480
studio about this. As some of you know, I work, I go to cons and I sell hentai video

2208
02:21:00,480 --> 02:21:05,520
games. Now, we're thinking about changing the packaging design to make it look more

2209
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:11,000
like, you know, normal like Wii, PS2, PS3 boxes. I had said that I don't think that's

2210
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:16,880
a very good idea because we'd have to deal with the ESRB who would want the games rated

2211
02:21:16,880 --> 02:21:23,600
and it would just go into just a very bad mess. And my thing is, I don't think that

2212
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:29,500
these adult hentai games should be like in stores or anything like that. I mean, how

2213
02:21:29,500 --> 02:21:34,040
would you feel if you walked into a GameStop or Target or Walmart and saw these games on

2214
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:38,880
the store shelves? Hold up. I would be delighted. Actually, yeah, that would be awesome, actually.

2215
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:44,640
Can you back up to square one a minute? You sell hentai games? Yeah. Are you redistributing

2216
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:47,800
them from another person or what is this? I didn't know you wrote games. What the hell

2217
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:52,760
is this? We redistribute them from a company called Jlist. Oh, okay, cool. I know Jlist.

2218
02:21:52,760 --> 02:21:59,080
I've ordered lots of snacks from them. I think you're okay designing box art that's similar.

2219
02:21:59,080 --> 02:22:03,680
I mean, honestly, if you want good examples of parody, go to the porn industry. That's

2220
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:08,040
kind of what you're going to have to do for these games. Do you know? Hey, wait, hold

2221
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:13,920
on. What? Random porno fact here. Did you know, remember that Not the Bradys thing that

2222
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:19,440
they had? They have Not the Munsters now. It's a porno Munsters movie. We have a house

2223
02:22:19,440 --> 02:22:25,720
not another porn movie. All right, look, look. I think you can get away with certain things

2224
02:22:25,720 --> 02:22:31,280
under parody. I mean, I would just be cautious using the same color scheme and using a lot

2225
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:35,840
of those things and not making, but there's nothing to stop you from doing like, you know,

2226
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:40,120
what's a color they don't use in games? Like purple, you know, purple is kind of a passion

2227
02:22:40,120 --> 02:22:43,720
color. Put a purple bar on the top and on the bottom that has the company and you can

2228
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:48,320
certainly put it in a DVD shaped case. There's nothing wrong with that. I mean, that's what

2229
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:52,440
we do now. Yeah. So why not does that? Yeah, you could design something, come up with something

2230
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:57,540
unique, but you could certainly do something that's consistent across the hentai land so

2231
02:22:57,540 --> 02:23:01,960
that, you know, when you see the purple border on the top of a certain shape or whatever,

2232
02:23:01,960 --> 02:23:06,280
you know, you're getting, so why exactly are you quality J list hentai? Now, why exactly

2233
02:23:06,280 --> 02:23:11,640
are you redesigning the packaging in the first place? Well, we feel that if we can convince

2234
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:15,520
J list to redesign the packages, the games would sell better. Cause if you look at it,

2235
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:19,160
cause if you look at the games that we sell now, they look like normal DVD box arts, you

2236
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:23,040
know, like normal movies. But if you pick it up and look like something like a game

2237
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:27,840
box, it would probably be more appealing. But most game boxes are just basically DVD

2238
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:32,880
cases. What you need to do, design something consistent, like, you know, like a purple

2239
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:38,160
bar along the top, that's in like a pixel art or something, you know, uh, uh, J what

2240
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:42,760
it, what do they, do they have a name for the series? Well, they're different hentai

2241
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:49,240
titles. That's just it. What's the name of a hentai title? One of them is, um, Amorous

2242
02:23:49,240 --> 02:23:53,480
Professor Cherry. That's one of the games that we sell. All right. Sexy Professor Series

2243
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:57,200
or something like that along the top. And like a pixel-y type art that makes me think

2244
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:03,560
of video games. That could work, but I'm just more worried about the fact that expanding

2245
02:24:03,560 --> 02:24:08,720
that the ESRB may be like, hey, you're selling PC games without our, um, rating, you know,

2246
02:24:08,720 --> 02:24:12,240
we don't want to deal with that. You don't put their rating on it. You're not making

2247
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:15,280
the games. They don't give a shit. And you're not, you're not big enough. They're not going

2248
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:19,920
to notice. As long as you make it. That's what I said. As long as it's very clear on

2249
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:25,440
the box, not for children, you'll be fine. You've got to have it somewhere on the box

2250
02:24:25,440 --> 02:24:30,760
very clear, not for children. Of course, like if the box art is like a dick going in a pussy,

2251
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:33,760
I don't think that, I think that's going to get the message. No, no, no. That's on the

2252
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:43,600
inside. Okay. Are the fronts like rather artistic? Yes, they're very artistic. Hey, wait a minute.

2253
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:46,920
We should, we should get some of these games. What they need to do is have like embossed

2254
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:53,320
packaging, especially around the boobular area. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you guys what.

2255
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:57,920
We do have some open copies. I can send you guys in sky. I have some Yowie titles for

2256
02:24:57,920 --> 02:25:05,880
you. Yes. Look, who's really excited about the Yowie titles. Did you hear that? No. You

2257
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:10,360
know what? Again, I'll review them for the show. Rama, here's my advice. You can do the

2258
02:25:10,360 --> 02:25:14,200
DVD packaging. It's on a small enough scale. I don't think they're going to care. Don't

2259
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:18,640
flat out copy what the big boys are doing. Come up with something similar. Nothing like

2260
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:24,040
that. Yeah. All right. There you go. And some of the chat room wants to see some of this

2261
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:28,840
art. Well, we're still working on the design. Once we get them up, let's see if I post them

2262
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:31,960
to the site so you can get everyone's opinion on it. Cause I do like the fact that we can

2263
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:37,280
make them look more like video game style boxes, but I'm just fearing that a parent's

2264
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:42,240
going to see this and just flip a shit. You know what you ought to do? And my director's

2265
02:25:42,240 --> 02:25:47,120
like, maybe we can get these in the game stuff. I'm like, uh-uh. No. Yeah, no, they're not

2266
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:49,640
going to want to carry out, but you might be able to get into indie game stores. You

2267
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:53,480
never know with back rooms. Hey, here's my thought though. Honestly, I know it's going

2268
02:25:53,480 --> 02:25:57,400
to sound crazy, but go back in the game in gaming's history and look at some of the box

2269
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:01,680
art that came out for games like Custer's revenge or even on the completely opposite

2270
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:05,400
end of the spectrum. Go look at like some of the box art for like Bible adventures and

2271
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:08,720
some of those games that came out on the NES because those games were unauthorized. Correct.

2272
02:26:08,720 --> 02:26:12,840
They were not official Nintendo products. Correct. And some of the color dreams games,

2273
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:18,080
you might find some inspiration. No. All right. Well, Rama, we got to let you go though, but

2274
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:21,200
good luck with the business. You're doing, you're doing a great thing for the community.

2275
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:26,860
Oh, we definitely do. Oh, and Rob, before I go, I know you and Jamie like, um, rumble

2276
02:26:26,860 --> 02:26:32,720
roses. There is a porn version of that available. Nice. Yeah, it's called ready to rumble. Nice.

2277
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:38,200
I want to see that. Is there a hentai podcast? Probably. I know my podcast gets a little

2278
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:43,480
bit hentai-ish at times. You know what? I think there is one. I think, I don't know

2279
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:46,400
if this guy listens anymore, but I remember way, way, way back in the day when we first

2280
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:49,960
first started podcasting, we were doing the to go stuff, right? There was a guy who ended

2281
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:54,320
up starting a hentai podcast because we got referrals from his site. I remember that.

2282
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:59,480
So, um, there's at least a hentai podcast, but a hentai gaming podcast, that might be

2283
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:04,440
a niche that needs to be discovered. My friend. Well, I might have to start reviewing them

2284
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:08,720
on my own podcast then. Huh? All right. There you go. Yeah. All right. We got to let you

2285
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:11,440
go around. I have a good one, buddy. Thanks a lot. Y'all have a good one. You're a true

2286
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:17,680
American company that made Custer's Revenge. I have a friend named Mystique. Oh, Mystique

2287
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:22,840
Entertainment. Yeah. Yeah. I met Mystique, right? Yeah. I did. The Amazonian girl. Yes.

2288
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:27,840
She was nice. She is. She's great. She's fun. But the box is so funny. It is very funny.

2289
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:31,320
See, but it's, it's, it's shaped like a normal Atari box. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2290
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:39,320
Who's this? Hi folks. Uh, this is Spazinator. I'm sorry. What was your name again? Spazinator.

2291
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:45,000
Spazinator. What's on your mind Spazinator? Uh, not much. Uh, there was two questions

2292
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:54,280
I neglected to put into my email, um, that I just thought of. Um, first off, uh, considering

2293
02:27:54,280 --> 02:28:00,440
that, uh, Street Fighter II, Hyper Fighting, and Samurai Shodown II are both available

2294
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:07,520
for Xbox Live Arcade. These posters achieved a chance that Super Street Fighter II, you

2295
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:14,040
know, Turbo, and Samurai Shodown IV, Abacuscus Revenge will eventually come out for Xbox

2296
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:20,120
Live Arcade, or no? Where there is money to be made, they will make it. But, aren't they

2297
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:23,600
doing the Super Street Fighter II High Def thing? That is coming out on Xbox Live. The

2298
02:28:23,600 --> 02:28:27,760
Super Street Fighter II High Def remix. They're doing that. Um, I don't know about Samurai

2299
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:30,840
Shodown IV so much, though. It really depends on how the other one sells. That's what it

2300
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:37,320
is. Yeah. Well, honestly, to be honest with you, I think that, at least with, uh, the

2301
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:42,160
Samurai Shodown series, uh, the fourth game is probably the best in the series, to be

2302
02:28:42,160 --> 02:28:46,800
honest with you. But, that's just one person's opinion. But, you know what else is selling,

2303
02:28:46,800 --> 02:28:50,320
though, are those compilations. And you never know. One of those is probably going to come

2304
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:54,200
out at some point for Xbox 360, because they have them on PlayStation 2. Why not? You know,

2305
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:58,720
there's people that buy that stuff, like candy. So, you know, even if it doesn't show up in

2306
02:28:58,720 --> 02:29:04,720
Arcade, you'll probably see it in a compilation down the line. Possibly, yeah. Um. What was

2307
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:11,400
the other question? Um, now, you know, considering that, uh, you know, next year, sometime next

2308
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:19,160
year in the United States, uh, to come out with, uh, was the DSi. Now, these posts that,

2309
02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:25,720
for someone that's only gotten, uh, the DS Lite, uh, within the past few months, and

2310
02:29:25,720 --> 02:29:31,560
really only got it for, sort of, third-party games, like, uh, the Final Fantasy remakes

2311
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:37,280
and Gene Albert rewards and whatnot, do you suppose there's any, you know, you know, good

2312
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:44,680
reason for someone to upgrade to the DSi, or should we just stick to the DS Lite? Well,

2313
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:48,800
this is interesting. Systems like the DSi are kind of starting to blur the line of our

2314
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:52,240
golden rule of gaming, and we've said this a million times on the show, but the golden

2315
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:56,880
rule of gaming is, a system is only as good as the games that are on it. So, if there

2316
02:29:56,880 --> 02:30:01,120
are games that are going to take advantage of the DSi's features that you absolutely

2317
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:05,920
have to have the DSi for, um, you know, it just depends what you like. You know Nintendo's

2318
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:09,360
going to come out with something. There's going to be that camera game, like Pokemon

2319
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:13,360
Snap Real Life or something, that's going to take advantage of some of those features,

2320
02:30:13,360 --> 02:30:17,240
um, on the DSi that's, that's going to make you want it. That doesn't mean you have to

2321
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:21,300
go out and buy one, buy one right away. But the reason why I say that line is starting

2322
02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:25,320
to be blurred a little bit is because look at systems like the PSP that don't really

2323
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:31,240
just focus on gaming, whereas, like, the fact that PSP plays games is kind of a sideshow

2324
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:34,760
to the fact that it surfs the internet, it downloads podcasts, you can, you know, do

2325
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:38,160
all this other stuff with it and interface with your PlayStation 3 on top of everything

2326
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:42,280
else. Um, it's made things very interesting. So, I think you also have to ask yourself

2327
02:30:42,280 --> 02:30:48,240
if there's not any games I want day one, do I really need that camera? Would I take pictures

2328
02:30:48,240 --> 02:30:53,700
to justify it? Or is the camera I have on my cell phone good enough? Do I want the applications

2329
02:30:53,700 --> 02:30:57,680
that are going to be in the store? Or do I already have what I really want on my iPhone?

2330
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:01,560
I don't think we know enough about the system yet to really answer these questions. I think

2331
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:07,000
there's definitely the oohs and aahs factors going on there. But the problem is, the camera,

2332
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:11,320
we've seen it before. The downloadable content, we've seen it before. Everything they're

2333
02:31:11,320 --> 02:31:15,360
putting into the DSi, we've seen before, we just haven't seen Nintendo do it. So the

2334
02:31:15,360 --> 02:31:20,280
question is, how is Nintendo going to do this and make it their own? And I think that's

2335
02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:25,040
really what has to be demonstrated. Anybody have anything else you want to add to that?

2336
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:32,880
Yeah, not to go poo-pooing on Nintendo or anything, but... Oh, why not? I was poo-pooing

2337
02:31:32,880 --> 02:31:40,520
on a Murphy car. I kind of got away from Nintendo over the past ten years, simply because, at

2338
02:31:40,520 --> 02:31:49,080
least with the F64, they have had not too great of a game lineup. Now, they have a handful

2339
02:31:49,080 --> 02:32:00,040
of games, but it's not overly great. It goes with the GameCube and even, to a certain extent,

2340
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:06,600
even with the Wii. I mean, yeah, the Wii is good for like the retro games and whatnot,

2341
02:32:06,600 --> 02:32:10,760
but aside from that, I don't think what to use for it.

2342
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:14,080
Spaznator, the simplest way I can say this is that there's going to be that game you're

2343
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:20,000
going to want the DSi for eventually, but that happens to the best of us. You know what?

2344
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,800
It is going to be the same damn thing. Mark my words, one or two years from now, it is

2345
02:32:24,800 --> 02:32:29,740
going to be the same damn thing because they're going to announce Wii HD or some shit that's

2346
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:33,920
going to be like, it'll play all your old Wii games, but it also now has the HD graphics

2347
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:37,840
and everything they were missing that Xbox had on them before. We're probably like a

2348
02:32:37,840 --> 02:32:40,960
year or two away from here and something like that, and it's going to be the same question.

2349
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:45,240
Do I really need to get one the first day, or does that game I have to have, is that

2350
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:46,240
a ways out?

2351
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:55,960
Yeah, ironically, I think I've heard either on Tech of the Show or X-Play within the past

2352
02:32:55,960 --> 02:33:06,080
couple days that Nintendo has actually finally announced or leaked some information about

2353
02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:10,200
like a Wii 2 or Wii HD.

2354
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:14,400
It was some dude that quit EGM and one up or whatever. He's a former editor that made

2355
02:33:14,400 --> 02:33:15,400
that comment.

2356
02:33:15,400 --> 02:33:20,380
And to be honest, that type of rumor shows up every six months. I mean, let's face reality.

2357
02:33:20,380 --> 02:33:25,000
Will Nintendo make another video game system? Fuck yes, they will. They've done extremely

2358
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:29,120
well with Wii. Yes, they're going to make another video game system. Will Nintendo make

2359
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:33,280
the system backwards compatible? Yes, they will. It was a big selling point of the Wii,

2360
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:37,640
was the fact that they had all the GameCube games available. So the fact that there will

2361
02:33:37,640 --> 02:33:42,720
be another video game system from Nintendo is not news. It's really not. I don't know

2362
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:50,840
why all these, there will be another, whether they call it Wii or Wii 2 or, you know, Turkey

2363
02:33:50,840 --> 02:33:56,320
Butt. It doesn't matter what they call it. I vote Turkey Butt. There will be some new

2364
02:33:56,320 --> 02:33:57,320
Nintendo system.

2365
02:33:57,320 --> 02:34:00,480
Yeah, we could go out and trademark that name, Turkey Butt, the game system.

2366
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:03,200
Yeah, but hey, we all laughed at Wii.

2367
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:04,200
Yeah.

2368
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:11,320
Dude, there's a new Mario game coming out on Turkey Butt. Oh, there you go.

2369
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:17,000
Yeah, honestly, I still give Nintendo a whole lot of crap about Wii. You know, I mean, it

2370
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:21,520
sounds like, you know, like you're telling someone about, they're about to use their

2371
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:26,360
restroom or, you know, you're suddenly, you know, trying to speak French or something.

2372
02:34:26,360 --> 02:34:29,240
Maybe both, I don't know.

2373
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:33,720
Right. Well, Spazinator, good luck in your quest for the DSi. You know what? You don't

2374
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:37,560
have to decide right now. We're not getting it for a year anyway. Honestly, I would not

2375
02:34:37,560 --> 02:34:42,480
import them unless like I had no digital camera or, you know, I don't know. But then again,

2376
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:45,800
Loki's really big on the whole. I want to exploit that SD card best I can. So maybe

2377
02:34:45,800 --> 02:34:50,320
I can see that angle too. But for me, you have a lot of time to decide this. So good

2378
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:53,560
luck to you. We'll keep bringing you the updates though on what games are going to release.

2379
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:54,560
So take care, buddy.

2380
02:34:54,560 --> 02:35:01,080
All right, you too. Thanks for the call. Bye-bye. All right. Let's take another call. Hi, you're

2381
02:35:01,080 --> 02:35:03,400
on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2382
02:35:03,400 --> 02:35:05,000
This will be the one and only Dark Knight.

2383
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,600
Hey, Dark Knight. What's on your mind, my friend?

2384
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:08,600
Hello.

2385
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:12,440
Talking about the DSi thing, talk about the innovation. And I remember you made a mistake

2386
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:16,520
earlier calling the DSi phone. Watch it. It'll probably end up being the next thing they'll

2387
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:17,520
probably do.

2388
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:24,360
Yeah. Well, it's just a matter of time. Tons of fucking people own a DS. I mean, really.

2389
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:28,160
I mean, I remember back in the day, you were kind of a nerd. If you had the old school

2390
02:35:28,160 --> 02:35:30,760
Game Boy brick or whatever, very few people had those.

2391
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:32,400
I know. The Dark Matrix one.

2392
02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:36,720
I was, we were sitting in a plane coming back from Penny Arcade Expo, and I looked across

2393
02:35:36,720 --> 02:35:40,760
the aisle, and there was an old lady with gray hair playing her DS. And I think that

2394
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:46,040
shows you just what a long way gaming has come in, you know, handheld gaming in so many

2395
02:35:46,040 --> 02:35:47,040
years.

2396
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:50,560
But it's fine, though, when you think about it now.

2397
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:54,980
You know, and really a more appropriate pun would be a DSi touch is really what this thing

2398
02:35:54,980 --> 02:35:58,760
is kind of to me, because it's going to have like little calendars and all sorts of things.

2399
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:02,040
And you know what? It might be kind of cool. Like I said, I'm going to get one, but it's

2400
02:36:02,040 --> 02:36:06,760
just, I joke because it's kind of like, well, I feel like we've kind of seen this all before.

2401
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:08,840
How is Nintendo going to make this special?

2402
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:11,320
That's what I really want to know.

2403
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:14,960
Should we go through the history list of the Game Boy again, like I did the previous nights?

2404
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:19,880
I mean, so many, I mean, so many sad things they did to it and whatnot. You can go all

2405
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:26,760
the way back from the Dark Matrix Game Boy to Game Boy Color, Game Boy Mike, Game Boy

2406
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:32,680
I got to jump in here with a really good comment and chat from Seg. I don't think Nintendo

2407
02:36:32,680 --> 02:36:37,560
has the pull enough to play with the telecom industry enough to make a DS phone thing.

2408
02:36:37,560 --> 02:36:40,760
You know what? That's a darn good point. But here's something else to consider. Nintendo's

2409
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:46,320
already kind of got their foot in the water with the whole VOIP thing, right? Like they

2410
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:49,080
were showing off the headset and I think they, you know, they do have the headset. They're

2411
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:53,760
not quite as on board as the PSP is with Skype and everything. But what do you want to bet?

2412
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:59,880
Nintendo could Nintendofy the entire way we think about VOIP. And when I say that, I mean

2413
02:36:59,880 --> 02:37:04,080
make it disgustingly simple so that even grandma can use it. That's how they're going to get

2414
02:37:04,080 --> 02:37:05,880
into the phone industry.

2415
02:37:05,880 --> 02:37:12,620
Well think about this, though. In the homebrew community, somebody actually already did that

2416
02:37:12,620 --> 02:37:15,120
a while back. But right now it's kind of like-

2417
02:37:15,120 --> 02:37:17,440
Yeah, the grandma on the airplane doesn't know that.

2418
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:22,000
Yeah. Not many people don't know that. There's one that somebody already made like a little

2419
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
VOIP, like a little VOIP thing in the homebrew community already. It's just that not many

2420
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
people don't, again, not many people don't know about it nor have the equipment to do

2421
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:35,880
so with it. Because I even have it on my DS for a while, but I was like, who in the world

2422
02:37:35,880 --> 02:37:38,880
I know going to find, who in the world I know actually have this?

2423
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:42,000
I got to say, I'm sorry. I just, while you're talking, the chat room is saying a lot of

2424
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:46,800
great stuff. I mean, you are too, but act deaf says WeSpeak may be the test for that.

2425
02:37:46,800 --> 02:37:51,200
That's a darn good thought. What if your DS could interface with WeSpeak? That might be

2426
02:37:51,200 --> 02:37:52,200
kind of neat.

2427
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:54,200
That, yeah, that would be a killer thought.

2428
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:57,200
That would be kind of neat, but that will never happen.

2429
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:02,800
As hard of a time as we give Nintendo, they might actually be sitting on genius. It's

2430
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:08,720
just a matter of will they do it? Okay. It's like, seriously, they're like the retard in

2431
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:14,000
a room with a big button that says, push button for million dollars. And they're like, duh.

2432
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,360
I don't know what to do.

2433
02:38:16,360 --> 02:38:20,080
They might be sitting, no, no, here's a better example. Come on. A better example would be

2434
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:24,800
that they are sitting on a freaking golden egg. And the question is, are they going to

2435
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:28,600
get smart and market this golden egg or are they going to fuck up and make an omelet out

2436
02:38:28,600 --> 02:38:30,400
of it? That's the question.

2437
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:35,080
Only time will tell. Only time will tell. I mean, it's Nintendo. Sometimes Nintendo

2438
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:40,000
knows how to basically like, they want to milk everything for what it's worth. Why not?

2439
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:46,240
All right. But you, you Dark Knight specifically, are you going to get the DSI?

2440
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:50,080
I'm probably going to pass on it because I'm basically going to be like, I'll wait for

2441
02:38:50,080 --> 02:38:54,960
it when a graphical change hits the DS. I'm not going to, I mean, innovation alone is

2442
02:38:54,960 --> 02:38:58,360
not really going to wow me this much. I'm still happy with my DS fat.

2443
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:02,800
Yeah, exactly. I mean, why did we even really need to upgrade to the light in the first

2444
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:06,840
place? Although I did, so it's hard for me to talk.

2445
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:11,560
I told him, I said, I was telling some people tonight, I said, if the DS were to have a

2446
02:39:11,560 --> 02:39:17,080
slight graphical upgrade, I may jump on it. But right now the DS, I just basically like

2447
02:39:17,080 --> 02:39:21,120
niche stuff and whatnot. I don't need all that niche stuff right now. I really don't.

2448
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:23,320
It's not, not really worth it.

2449
02:39:23,320 --> 02:39:26,360
All right. Well, any other thoughts tonight, Dark Knight, before we let you go? We want

2450
02:39:26,360 --> 02:39:29,360
to try to get one more thing.

2451
02:39:29,360 --> 02:39:33,440
I had so many thoughts, but I left my brain, but I'll be discussing it next week when I

2452
02:39:33,440 --> 02:39:34,440
do my thing.

2453
02:39:34,440 --> 02:39:38,360
All right. It's all good, Dark Knight. You have a good night. Okay. And thanks for calling.

2454
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:40,360
Yeah, you do the same. Take care guys.

2455
02:39:40,360 --> 02:39:45,080
Let's go talk to Nintendo with us. Have a good one. All right. We'll take one more call.

2456
02:39:45,080 --> 02:39:51,760
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2457
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:55,440
And you can talk about Nintendo or you can talk about Tokyo Game Show. You can talk about

2458
02:39:55,440 --> 02:39:58,680
SingStar ABBA. I would love that.

2459
02:39:58,680 --> 02:40:00,040
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2460
02:40:00,040 --> 02:40:03,840
Hi, this is Hack Deft.

2461
02:40:03,840 --> 02:40:08,360
Hey, Hack Deft. Wow. It's almost like it's your show tonight. You won the code earlier

2462
02:40:08,360 --> 02:40:11,920
and we've been reading your chat comments and now here you are. That's all right, though.

2463
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:19,640
We enjoy hearing from our friends, especially those abroad. What's on your mind tonight?

2464
02:40:19,640 --> 02:40:25,800
Well, basically about the ACDC track pack Walmart's going to sell.

2465
02:40:25,800 --> 02:40:26,800
Yes.

2466
02:40:26,800 --> 02:40:35,120
I'm thinking that maybe Harmonix and EA, in this case, are taking the steps of Activision

2467
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:42,440
and what they're doing with Guitar Hero. Guitar Hero Aerosmith and next year Guitar Hero Metallica.

2468
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:49,280
Maybe they're going the same steps, though I'm thinking that they are doing the wrong

2469
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:50,280
thing with it.

2470
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:59,600
I think they should have maybe released the disc itself but also made it download content

2471
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:09,240
and maybe offer it for a cheaper price because $3 for 20 or so songs, for me, I think it's

2472
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:13,320
expensive even though it's a new game.

2473
02:41:13,320 --> 02:41:20,960
Here's the weird thing. I kind of have a feeling this is the part just before the dam breaks.

2474
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:26,080
This is the first little drop that leaks out the dam. This is them testing the waters to

2475
02:41:26,080 --> 02:41:31,600
see if this is going to sell. There's a lot of hardcore ACDC fans out there that are going

2476
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:35,400
to be all over this crap.

2477
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:40,400
Look at how much I am freaking obsessed over SingStar ABBA. Half of it is in jest but the

2478
02:41:40,400 --> 02:41:45,280
other half really isn't. I freaking love ABBA. They're the best band out of the 70s. Call

2479
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:50,340
me the biggest gay or whatever you want but I will buy this game because it's awesome.

2480
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:55,920
There are people like that out there for ACDC. The question is how much are going to put

2481
02:41:55,920 --> 02:42:01,680
$40 out there to get this game and if this sells even remotely well, the floodgates are

2482
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:06,960
going to burst open next year and you are going to see this kind of stuff for 10 bands

2483
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:12,840
next year. If they can make that much money off of it, this is where music is going.

2484
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:21,760
That's why I'm worrying because if it sells, and I know it will sell because there are

2485
02:42:21,760 --> 02:42:33,480
a lot of ACDC fans but maybe they could offer the same thing just on the Xbox Live marketplace

2486
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:41,060
or on the Playstation Network and make it also downloadable because not everyone is

2487
02:42:41,060 --> 02:42:49,360
a fan of ACDC but some of them like their songs. Maybe the same thing you could say

2488
02:42:49,360 --> 02:42:56,280
with ABBA. Like someone said on the chat earlier, you could make the songs downloadable content

2489
02:42:56,280 --> 02:43:02,000
for SingStar on the Playstation 3 but there aren't.

2490
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:06,000
What maybe the artist didn't want it that way. Maybe the artist was one of those types

2491
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:09,140
that was like, you know what, if we're going to do this, we want to go all in and maybe

2492
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:12,700
that's how they get some of these artists on board because let's face it, these two

2493
02:43:12,700 --> 02:43:17,520
names we're looking at here, ABBA, ACDC, even things like Aerosmith and Metallica, these

2494
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:20,840
are not, as much as I was joking earlier, these are not small time bands. These are

2495
02:43:20,840 --> 02:43:27,660
big deals. These are company bands with monies and shirts and everything. These are not the

2496
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:32,160
people that want their songs going two dollars a pop. They probably want to go all in with

2497
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:35,280
this stuff. You know what I mean?

2498
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:40,100
They want people to have not just, they don't want their song thrown in as an afterthought

2499
02:43:40,100 --> 02:43:44,400
in the game. They want an experience built around their band. You know this is how they're

2500
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:49,400
selling it to them. When they sit down at the table with ABBA, with ACDC, they're sitting

2501
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:56,300
there saying, we want to make this game a whole new way to experience your band and

2502
02:43:56,300 --> 02:44:00,520
your music and the brand you built. Just feeding the ego.

2503
02:44:00,520 --> 02:44:10,040
Yeah, that's true. But still, I think they could offer the disc for all the fans because

2504
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:16,760
I know there are going to be people that are going to buy it just because it's ACDC. Like

2505
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:22,480
I said, and even you, you're going to buy the ABBA disc because it's ABBA. If they make

2506
02:44:22,480 --> 02:44:27,920
a Death Tones track pack, I know I'm going to buy it because I'm a big Death Tones fan.

2507
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:37,080
But still, they could offer the same thing for a cheaper price, at least. I would buy

2508
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:42,360
the ACDC pack for $30, at least. You know what, though? I bet for the...

2509
02:44:42,360 --> 02:44:49,760
I know it's going to be a separate game. It's going to have its own achievements and everything.

2510
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:56,960
Think about this. Here's what it is. I bet you this is it. Look at the time of year this

2511
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:04,040
game is coming out, too. It's really hard to buy someone download content as a present.

2512
02:45:04,040 --> 02:45:08,000
But if your grandma, and you're walking in the aisles of Walmart, and you know little

2513
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:13,680
Timmy loves ACDC, what do you think you might end up buying him as a present? Because you

2514
02:45:13,680 --> 02:45:18,320
know he loves ACDC. You know he loves rock band. That's a huge factor in this. Don't

2515
02:45:18,320 --> 02:45:23,720
discount that. Grandma's less likely to pick up the point cards than she is to pick up

2516
02:45:23,720 --> 02:45:30,400
ACDC rock band track pack as a present. Something to think about.

2517
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:31,400
Yeah, that's true.

2518
02:45:31,400 --> 02:45:37,000
I don't know. All these are things to consider. They definitely all are. BlackWolf wants to

2519
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:42,720
point out also the ACDC pack is cheaper as a track pack than it would if it were separate.

2520
02:45:42,720 --> 02:45:49,560
It's $30 as a track pack. It's $35 if each song was available for $2 a pop individually.

2521
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:54,080
But again, I think they're catering to the impulse buys. That's what they are.

2522
02:45:54,080 --> 02:46:03,200
Yeah, the 360 and the Playstation 3 version is going to sell for $39.99, so $40 exactly.

2523
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:04,200
And if you have a friend who...

2524
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:14,680
It's still a little bit expensive. Especially because of people that download songs and

2525
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:19,840
maybe a track pack. They have a particular song they like and they would like to play.

2526
02:46:19,840 --> 02:46:24,560
But still, they would have to buy the $30 disc and just for one song.

2527
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:29,920
And here's the thing too. If you have a friend that likes ACDC and doesn't really necessarily

2528
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:35,560
have rock band or doesn't really care about dumping the songs onto his hard drive, you

2529
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:40,440
could dump them on your own hard drive and then maybe go in half with him for the actual

2530
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:41,440
game.

2531
02:46:41,440 --> 02:46:43,720
I don't think there's enough people that are going to think about that.

2532
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,720
I don't know.

2533
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:47,960
Alright, Act Def, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you

2534
02:46:47,960 --> 02:46:52,480
so much for your call and hey, I'll be crossing my fingers for the Deftones game for you,

2535
02:46:52,480 --> 02:46:53,480
okay?

2536
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:54,480
Thanks.

2537
02:46:54,480 --> 02:46:58,200
Alright, take care, buddy. Quick comments from chat though. We're going to wrap up for

2538
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:01,120
the Skype line tonight. Sorry if those didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up the

2539
02:47:01,120 --> 02:47:04,920
show here. Reading some comments from chat, I like this.

2540
02:47:04,920 --> 02:47:10,280
Retertainment says, Grandma is not likely to pick up a game anyway. For herself, no.

2541
02:47:10,280 --> 02:47:16,400
But if your grandma does buy ACDC rock band for herself, you do have the coolest fucking

2542
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:17,400
grandma in the world.

2543
02:47:17,400 --> 02:47:22,120
My grandmother drove me all over Mobile trying to find Killer Instinct when it came out.

2544
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:23,520
Awesome. That is very awesome.

2545
02:47:23,520 --> 02:47:25,200
So I do have the coolest grandmother in the world.

2546
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:29,640
I don't, but I think grandma might buy it for, I don't, you know, I use grandma loosely,

2547
02:47:29,640 --> 02:47:32,840
you know what I mean? Like, you know, a friend trying to, or a relative trying to buy it

2548
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:35,080
for, you know, but you know what I mean.

2549
02:47:35,080 --> 02:47:36,240
I still have the coolest grandmother in the world.

2550
02:47:36,240 --> 02:47:42,760
And nobody said that it wasn't exclusive, you know, permanently for Walmart. I mean,

2551
02:47:42,760 --> 02:47:48,080
honestly, I have a feeling that maybe it will come out as download content later on.

2552
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:51,320
That's true. Wherever they can sell it, they will.

2553
02:47:51,320 --> 02:47:56,840
Yeah. Grandma is person buying a game for other people, says Seg. That's, that's the

2554
02:47:56,840 --> 02:47:58,160
point. You got it.

2555
02:47:58,160 --> 02:48:02,560
All right. That's it. We're going to wrap up. It's another show. We're done. We're out

2556
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:06,640
of here. It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night. And we will start

2557
02:48:06,640 --> 02:48:09,120
off with Loki, your final thought tonight.

2558
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:13,480
My final thought is I have a game that I'm going to be playing a lot of, and you'll see

2559
02:48:13,480 --> 02:48:15,000
some of that very soon.

2560
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,600
All right. I never asked for any last minute stories. Do you have any?

2561
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:18,600
I have a last minute story.

2562
02:48:18,600 --> 02:48:22,040
Okay. Some quick headlines. I'm sorry. Dark Sakura.

2563
02:48:22,040 --> 02:48:26,640
For anyone who actually is interested in playing on the International Ragnarok Online server,

2564
02:48:26,640 --> 02:48:33,540
they have a free server up. It's called Valkyrie. And you've got a couple of, you know, detriments

2565
02:48:33,540 --> 02:48:37,140
to playing on it, but really it's good if you want to get into the official Ragnarok

2566
02:48:37,140 --> 02:48:40,160
Online community. And I'll link a page in the chatroom.

2567
02:48:40,160 --> 02:48:47,160
All right. Very cool. PopCap is releasing Bejeweled Twist in October. I told my wife

2568
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:52,560
and she didn't give a shit. Apparently she's ever bejeweled now. I don't know. It's weird.

2569
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:56,120
But it's supposed to add some new features to it. No word on what those features are

2570
02:48:56,120 --> 02:49:00,000
yet, but something that has to do with probably twisting, I'm guessing.

2571
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:06,960
The PSP 5.0 firmware has been, is out there in testing phase right now. And it is going

2572
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:13,080
to add the WiFi store and also allow you to do screen captures, which are currently available

2573
02:49:13,080 --> 02:49:20,040
in the not so official homebrew firmwares right now. And no word on when that's going

2574
02:49:20,040 --> 02:49:26,040
to be coming, but hopefully, probably sometime in October.

2575
02:49:26,040 --> 02:49:32,440
And then finally, it's rumored that Motley Crue's Dr. Phil Good is going to be coming

2576
02:49:32,440 --> 02:49:40,760
Rock Band download content on October 14th. And this actually comes from a post on iMeme.com

2577
02:49:40,760 --> 02:49:45,520
where they are doing a giveaway of Motley Crue's albums. And they also mentioned that

2578
02:49:45,520 --> 02:49:50,180
Rock Band will be coming as download content on October, or Dr. Phil Good will be coming

2579
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:57,720
as download content on Rock Band starting October 24th. So that's kind of interesting.

2580
02:49:57,720 --> 02:50:06,240
And finally, Taiko no Tatujin in Japan. The Wii version is getting a special wireless

2581
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:16,440
drum that you can purchase as well in a bundle that will cost approximately $75 or $7,980.

2582
02:50:16,440 --> 02:50:22,280
And the drum is also getting purchased separately for $3,990 or approximately $38. And of course

2583
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:30,880
the game will be out in Japan on the Wii December 12th. It's kind of neat.

2584
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:35,600
So since I kind of derailed your other thought, do you now have a final thought now that we've

2585
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:37,640
gotten all the last ministories taken care of?

2586
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:38,640
No.

2587
02:50:38,640 --> 02:50:42,600
Alright. My final thought is, I hear they're opening a Pinkberry in the Bay Area and I

2588
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:55,720
want to go. Cause it's good. DarkSocker, your final thought. Alright. Hey, knock it off!

2589
02:50:55,720 --> 02:51:01,160
Alright. Heart. Hey, if you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, then please help us spread the word.

2590
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:05,320
We're independent radio. We don't get paid for this. We don't have a magazine backing

2591
02:51:05,320 --> 02:51:09,400
us or a TV station or any of that stuff. So please help spread the word about Orange Lounge

2592
02:51:09,400 --> 02:51:12,640
Radio because we do this for free. If you like what you've heard, tell two friends about

2593
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:16,360
our show and help us spread the word slowly. Or hey, you can leave us a nice review on

2594
02:51:16,360 --> 02:51:20,320
iTunes. As many people have done lately, we're up to like 85 reviews on there right now and

2595
02:51:20,320 --> 02:51:23,640
a lot of them are really, really nice and really good and really make us feel good about

2596
02:51:23,640 --> 02:51:27,560
what we do. And it helps spread the word because the more 5-star reviews we get, the higher

2597
02:51:27,560 --> 02:51:31,820
we get in the rankings. So please leave us some more nice reviews on iTunes. You guys

2598
02:51:31,820 --> 02:51:33,680
are awesome for that.

2599
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:37,200
And one other quick thing before we head out tonight. One other very, very quick thing

2600
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:43,040
before we head out tonight. As I understand it, two of OLR's listeners, Dekeman and Kiki

2601
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:47,640
Nico, I don't know if you know, but last year they had a baby. One year ago, they had a

2602
02:51:47,640 --> 02:51:54,200
baby, Kylie, and Kylie is turning one year old this week. So we want to say happy birthday

2603
02:51:54,200 --> 02:51:56,000
to Kylie on baby's first birthday.

2604
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,280
You know what I was going to say, because I don't have any, I'm not going to sing happy

2605
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:03,280
birthday because I don't sing, I will give you a little bit of this.

2606
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:12,800
Happy birthday to baby Kylie.

2607
02:52:12,800 --> 02:52:15,320
And also happy birthday to Kylie Minogue whenever her birthday is because she's awesome.

2608
02:52:15,320 --> 02:52:16,680
Sorry, I had one last story and this was fun.

2609
02:52:16,680 --> 02:52:17,680
No, the show's over.

2610
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:20,080
No, one more. This is kind of cool, okay.

2611
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:21,080
All right.

2612
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:25,500
Bungie's bringing out a video renderer soon to Halo 3. So they'll actually have an option

2613
02:52:25,500 --> 02:52:33,040
for those who subscribe to the Bungie Pro where you'll be able to actually export videos

2614
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:39,000
made in Halo to a Windows Media format for whatever you may want to use that for.

2615
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,360
Okay, that is kind of cool.

2616
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:41,360
Yeah.

2617
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:44,640
But not nearly as awesome as Kylie Minogue.

2618
02:52:44,640 --> 02:52:49,560
Thank you everybody for tuning into Orange Lounge Radio. We'll see you next time for

2619
02:52:49,560 --> 02:52:54,480
more wackiness and hopefully joining us in the studio will be Ball Hair the Dwarf. Good

2620
02:52:54,480 --> 02:52:55,480
night.

2621
