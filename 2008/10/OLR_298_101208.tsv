14172	24601	Tonight, October 12, 2008, rumors about Blu-ray on 360 surface again, a next-gen Castlevania gets teased, and will YouTube soon sell you games?
31556	35461	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35501	38144	We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
38525	44031	For the next few hours we're going to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44131	49498	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you for the next few hours as will the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
50077	52559	I will be not joining everybody for the next few hours.
52579	53780	Where are you going, young lady?
54541	55041	Out of body.
55341	55622	All right.
56382	58224	Well, have fun and let us know how it goes.
58484	59225	Sure thing, Rob.
59245	60125	Where are you going to be visiting?
60166	61306	Are you going to go to Disneyland and back?
61547	61767	Yep.
61967	62227	All right.
62267	62668	Have fun.
62808	64009	Ride Space Mountain for me.
64189	64469	Woo-hoo.
64669	64909	All right.
65530	69213	And also say hello to Tech Master Loki, who's giggling like a schoolgirl over here.
69233	70154	I'm not giggling like a schoolgirl.
70174	70594	Yes, you are.
70934	72496	I was doing the opening and I hear, woo-hoo.
73393	73934	Don't Shoot the Puppy
89477	90237	Wait, is your mic on?
90317	91698	You're very, very quiet tonight for some reason.
91858	92859	I have no on-off button.
92879	93239	Oh, there you go.
93259	94420	Well, you just weren't talking into it, right?
94600	95480	Alright, sorry, go ahead.
95520	96461	So, don't shoot the puppy?
96701	97601	Yeah, don't shoot the puppy.
98102	112489	The puppy hops across the screen very happily, but it gets slower every level, and you just keep getting, you know, it's a test of patience, and if you get frustrated and you push a button, it shoots the puppy with, like, this giant artillery cannon.
114690	115691	This sounds terrible.
115731	117192	Wait, this is a Flash game or something?
117212	117732	Yes, it is.
120649	121530	And that's the whole game.
121550	122130	You just sit there.
122330	122910	Can I see this?
124891	126952	I know this is horrible radio, but can I... What the hell?
127313	127693	What happened?
127713	128413	Did you shoot the puppy?
128513	128693	Oh, no.
128954	131195	I clicked the button and it's... You'll just have to show me later.
131215	132335	This is horrible radio.
134276	137958	Apparently, PETA has just joined our chat room and is currently protesting the show.
138499	138939	Oh, there we go.
138959	139759	PETA's full of shit.
140100	142321	Oh, it's a cute little stick figure puppy.
142401	145983	Okay, so start... Does it bark and stuff?
147352	148553	I don't know, I don't have the sound on.
148693	157119	This is coming from a website, rrrr, that's five r's, dot com, even though there's only four.
157559	158260	Okay, so shoot it.
161882	162963	Oh, that's terrible.
163423	165625	At least it's only a cartoon, it's not like the real thing.
168027	172750	So wait, again, the website, rrrr, that's five r's, even though it's really only four.
174970	176030	Love that sense of humor.
176070	177011	That's something else.
177051	177311	All right.
177911	181692	Anyhow, hey, you guys are joining us in chat.
181732	184652	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com here live on this Sunday evening.
185112	186212	DJ Dysentery?
186433	187353	Yes, DJ Dysentery.
187393	189173	I think DJ Dysentery has listened to the show before.
189453	192154	I know, but that just makes me think of poo.
192214	194954	DJ Dysentery is in chat and says, I don't think there's sound.
196775	197815	So, all right.
198578	199619	DarkSakura, what have you played this week?
199779	201221	I have disproven the old theory What theory is that?
201241	202962	That Airman can be defeated after all Because I played Mega Man 2
221929	224810	GS68, you're great people for the unethical shit-talking of humans.
247492	248053	Puesto?
248193	249593	I've never heard of that.
249893	250353	Puesto.
250554	252654	No, PETA is People Eating Tasty Animals.
252694	254255	Alright, come on, enough PETA talk.
254455	255336	PETA's full of shit anyway.
258417	269081	But I played some Mega Man 2, and we actually were playing through Mega Man 9, Dan and his buddy Jeff were, and there's some really annoying levels in that game.
270202	271382	Is it kind of weird to go back and-
273188	273969	Mega Man 2 had more drops.
273989	276271	And if I'm correct, the difficult mode was the default mode for the Japanese version.
276291	277012	It sure was.
290072	300815	and another thing is that we were talking about the Mega Man 2 Anniversary Edition that came out on PlayStation and how it was a lot harder.
301515	303816	Because it was based off the Japanese one, if I remember right.
303836	304696	No, it was harder than that.
305576	308237	It was harder than that because we went through and played on difficult mode.
308337	309637	Oh, that's so wrong.
309677	310217	What?
310897	311298	Sorry.
312538	313498	Don't shoot the puppy.
314418	315539	Sorry to go back to that again.
316139	316319	But...
317296	318196	Thank you for watching!
334878	361831	well um at any rate um we also did the try to proto man mode and it's freaking kind of tough too because he takes double damage but he has the shield and it's it would be really hard to make it through through uh that the wiliest stages with proto man um also um i've played ragnarok ragnar crack crack rock all right but um
362620	363260	and I did homework.
364161	364641	Homework game.
364741	365462	Mega Manorific.
365842	367263	I also watched the debate game too.
367803	368143	Awesome.
368884	369484	And voted!
369944	371005	I voted this week!
371505	371825	Awesome.
372666	373426	As everybody should.
374227	376388	No matter who you support, you should go out and vote.
376969	378229	Because voting is important.
378309	380110	If you don't vote, you don't get to complain about the result.
381211	381411	Right?
383032	383893	Anyhow, let's move on.
384313	385313	Loki, how was your gaming week?
386614	387215	It was alright.
387715	388896	Only really played a couple things.
389936	391177	Grand Theft Auto 4, as usual.
392314	396299	and I also played more Saints Row 2 because that game is awesome.
396359	404489	Now I'm finished the Brotherhood storyline and I'm starting the Sons of Samiti and that's kind of interesting.
405670	412218	And I tried to play some online deathmatch today but it was hard to join the game so...
413208	414369	Ended up quitting on that.
415349	423734	And then I played a bit of Fable 2 and got past the child stage in it and started kind of your adult life.
424454	426755	And really got distracted with dancing in front of people.
427096	428456	And then I got an achievement for it.
428556	429257	And that's where I quit.
429817	431098	So, yeah.
432979	433259	Awesome.
434572	438593	You've been getting a sneak peek at a lot of early holiday games, because Fable 2 is not out for a couple weeks, right?
438633	439413	That's right.
439913	441774	And Saints Row 2 is out, what, this week?
441974	442274	Tuesday.
442394	442654	Finally.
443294	444995	At least you'll finally have some people to play multiplayer with.
445155	445435	Awesome.
445575	448235	It'll be cool, and keep finding new things to do in that game.
448535	449496	It's awesome.
450176	453797	So, you didn't really spend a whole lot of time with Fable 2, so you can't tell us a whole lot more about it.
454357	455617	Like, how does it compare to the first one?
456277	458758	I never played the first one, so that I really can't tell you.
458918	459098	Gotcha.
459118	459238	Gotcha.
460580	462141	All right, well, let's see, moving on.
462301	463042	My gaming week.
464262	466644	You know, I've been playing a variety of stuff, pretty much the old stuff.
466664	469246	You know, the old standbys, Warcraft and so on.
470266	471727	But I did check out a couple new games.
471807	474129	Beat and Groovy on Xbox Live Arcade.
474469	477611	You know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're longtime music game fans.
477651	483215	I mean, you know, the roots of our station, the name of the station comes from old school music games.
483255	488658	And you actually see it show up in this game, Beat and Groovy, because one of the songs is by a group called Orange Lounge.
488678	489379	And that's kind of where...
489959	490880	Thank you for watching!
511820	513781	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
541349	542329	Thanks for watching!
559575	560436	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
576893	577654	I know, I've seen it.
577694	581257	I've seen the import versions of Poppy Music, which are some really fun music games.
581597	593588	And it's a shame that now people who don't get music games, or people that think that Guitar Hero was the first music game ever made, or maybe even like Frequency or Amplitude, are going to think that this whole franchise is just total crap based off of this.
593969	596531	I mean, A, you can't remap the controls.
596891	600515	When you play online, you can only play online in three-button mode.
601653	602594	Thanks for watching!
620384	621004	Thank you for watching!
636167	641171	And I don't think we should have to support it simply because it's pop and music and simply because it's the game we want to see.
641191	646316	And I'm sorry, I reject those calls that say we should buy this because then we might get this.
646936	647757	I'm sorry, no.
648257	650079	We don't live in that day and age anymore.
650539	658346	If Konami hasn't learned the lesson by now that Americans are willing to latch on to good music games, then they're just not going to get it.
659537	666099	So I see no need to buy this game to somehow justify them to fix it and put out the game they should have in the first place.
667119	672421	That being said, I did buy the game, but I felt some type of editorial obligation to because I don't get them for free.
672841	674962	And I wanted to give you a fair impression here on the show.
675062	677263	But again, this game is just so borked.
677303	678343	By the way, the leaderboards...
679830	684591	You would think the leaderboard scores would be like endless mode or who got the highest score on this song.
684651	690112	Nope, it's one leaderboard and it's for online mode and it's not even wins versus losses.
690172	692053	It's a cumulative score.
692473	699055	So in other words, the person who's ranked number one on the Beat and Groovy leaderboard is just the person who's played the most matches online and gotten the highest score because of it.
699475	699975	That's dumb.
700315	700735	It's dumb.
701375	706576	This game is borked in so many ways and it's really, really sad.
706796	709417	I looked at video and it made my heart break a little bit
711940	712340	There you go.
712781	721811	So honestly, I mean, again, it's sad because I think there could have been a good game here, but for right now, if you want to play a decent music game on Xbox Live Arcade, just go get Boom Boom Rocket.
722051	722952	It's the same concept.
722972	724794	You mash buttons to things when they hit a line.
725094	726175	It's a lot better looking.
727417	732402	I wish I could say the music's better in Boom Boom Rocket, but actually that would be the one thing that Poppin' Music has on...
734152	738735	The other game, Boom Boom Rocket, is that the song list is slightly better, even if it is nine songs.
738975	748881	There's some pretty good songs in it, like Moon and Star Mine and the Earth whatever song that sounds like the... Yeah, that song's pretty cool, too.
748901	749521	That's it.
749681	750062	Hey, Rob.
750362	750522	What?
750622	752643	We should go to my house and play poppin' music.
753003	753484	We should.
753624	755365	I mean, honestly... I'd rather play Session Wind.
755845	759967	If you want to play a great music game that's like Beat and Groovy, go import poppin' music.
759988	760368	Seriously.
760388	760728	Seriously.
761280	764021	I really, really, really want an arcade-style controller.
764781	765341	They are fun.
765401	766581	I had a friend that had one.
766761	767242	They're fun.
767342	770082	It's just kind of weird that they would release this game with no controller here.
770142	770602	I know.
771503	776584	It makes no sense because, I mean, have you ever tried to play poppin' music on the PlayStation controller?
776604	777064	Yeah.
777244	778104	It's freaking hard.
778844	780865	Although it is kind of fun to try it on a 2DX controller.
781445	786386	Now our buddy Bobby Blackwolf actually did this pretty awesome YouTube that compares Beat & Groovy to Poppin' Music 13.
786446	788707	The note charts are the exact same.
789895	790696	Which is fine.
791256	792237	I understand that.
792297	802405	I mean, I don't hold that against them, except for the fact that sometimes you have the purple and the blue notes come up back to back, and when you have to use the control pad for both of those, it makes it hard.
802445	804807	You can't hit two on the control pad at the same time.
804827	808630	I mean, you can kind of do upper left, but it's mixed results at best.
808970	811072	And what if you have the purple and the orange?
812653	814455	Well, I guess you can hit one with the white, but still, it just...
816360	817600	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
843353	851879	I forgot to mention with Saints Row 2, all the cheat codes leaked online, including those wonderful exclusive codes that GameStop had if you pre-ordered the game.
852779	861205	Note to anyone buying anything from GameStop, if it has a code involved with it and it's not actually a Microsoft code where you download something off of their service, it's going to leak out immediately.
863106	863567	That's fun.
863767	865608	They have the Evil Cars code in there.
866089	873714	They have a code to get a pocket bike and then you can do a code to make yourself even larger so it looks like you're just sitting down and driving that way.
875071	875832	Super Explosions.
876112	876993	Yeah.
877013	879175	Reading some comments from chatroom about Beat and Groovy.
879435	885600	GS68 says, When if I somehow get a job over the winter, I'll use the monies for a desktop arcade and one of the CS releases.
886281	888423	Yeah, that would probably be a better investment.
889604	892186	DJ Dysentery says, Well, props for Starmine at least.
892266	892667	I agree.
892707	895629	It does seem like they kind of tried to throw us a bone or two on the song list.
895649	896870	They gave us some really cool songs.
897631	898052	But, yeah.
899072	907616	Well, did you notice that the game's... I mean, I didn't even play it at all, but just from the videos, the game has, like, this urban vibe to it, and then there's super Eurobeat in there.
907656	910978	It's like... Well, it's... You know what?
911038	915980	This game wasn't... It's weird, because I feel like this game wasn't really made for America, even though it came out here.
916120	918681	It definitely caters to the Japanese style.
921241	924644	SSJ100 Matt says it tried to be like Boom Boom Rocket except it wasn't fun.
924924	932009	That's kind of the whole thing though is that it wasn't trying to be Boom Boom Rocket because this game has been out for years and years before Boom Boom Rocket.
932369	941296	It's just that unfortunately that's the impression most people are going to have of this game because of the fact that it's lackluster in many many departments and it pains me to say that.
941796	944260	I know there is a great game in there somewhere.
944380	945802	I've played poppin' music 11, 12, 10, 8.
947644	949527	I've played tons of those poppin' music games.
949547	951710	It's way fun, especially with that giant controller.
952010	952270	This?
952711	953472	Not fun.
953672	957638	I wonder if they just, you know, said, hey, um...
959724	961205	What if it though is testing the waters?
989904	991325	And then they failed.
991445	992446	For a potential release.
992626	997609	That's what fucking bugs me about Konamiya Japan, is that they shouldn't have to.
998130	1003773	If you want to see if a music game is going to do good here in America, fucking look at Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
1004454	1009797	If they're not going to get... God, it just makes me angry how fucking dense they are in not understanding the music.
1009817	1013320	I mean, they have a fucking cult based around these music games here in America.
1013840	1018343	And they turn a blind eye to it all the time and release crap like this.
1018743	1020944	Well, it worked in Japan, so it must work in America.
1021024	1022585	Ten years ago it worked in Japan.
1023005	1023965	Times have changed.
1024226	1025426	The bar has been risen.
1025506	1026046	Wake up.
1027367	1029008	Konami of Japan, wake up.
1031269	1032269	Rob for President 12.
1036832	1037192	F that.
1037232	1038572	Make me CEO of Konami.
1038592	1040333	I'll go change some things real quick.
1042274	1042614	All right.
1043495	1043795	Anyhow.
1044993	1046014	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1074150	1074790	But it happens.
1074850	1075711	Life gets in the way.
1076091	1079472	We're not the only podcast that sometimes gets a little slow, so sorry about that.
1080453	1085135	Always, there is our LiveJournal and MySpace and Facebook that we like to plug as well.
1085755	1086895	MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.
1086955	1089316	LiveJournal, Orange Lounge, and Facebook, OL Army.
1089596	1091237	Be sure to add us on those various sites.
1091297	1092858	And Twitter now as well, OLR.
1093138	1100361	And we'll get to the pre-show OLR tweet question in just a little bit when we start talking about Tokyo Game Show, which I'm sure we're going to get to.
1101061	1107507	During the news report, but first, some news out of the Tokyo Game Show that I'm kind of surprised wasn't announced here in America, right, Loki?
1107608	1108048	Exactly.
1109009	1111732	I think, well, really the last U.S.
1112272	1123804	Microsoft press conference that they had was pretty much at, well, I guess they could have done one at PAX, but it was pretty much at E3, and of course this game was rumored to have been...
1124830	1127871	About to be announced at E3, but for whatever reason they stopped it.
1128471	1133312	So they left it for Tokyo Game Show, and the course of that game is Halo 3 Recon.
1133872	1139734	It's the one that they were teasing with the Bungie little viral video thing that they released.
1139974	1141154	Brand new teaser trailer.
1141875	1144655	And Halo 3 Recon will be a standalone game.
1144855	1146656	It includes new multiplayer maps.
1148016	1150177	It takes place before Halo 3.
1151477	1153698	And actually...
1155339	1155800	Thanks for watching!
1175168	1175448	I don't know.
1175609	1176310	It looks kind of neat.
1176851	1179454	They announced it's going to be coming out in the fall of 2009.
1180195	1182960	That's kind of surprising because I thought it was supposed to be coming out in the spring.
1183460	1185884	Or at least it would have made more sense to come out in the spring, I think.
1186064	1187406	I don't know.
1187947	1190451	I guess this is the next big Halo game that we're going to be getting.
1190967	1192268	Do you think it's going to do as well as Halo 3?
1192528	1193028	I don't think so.
1193048	1197370	Because Halo 3 was... I think it was one of those games where the hype really killed it.
1197830	1202872	I mean, like, Halo 3, I think if it didn't have all that hype behind it, would have been pretty well received.
1203112	1208734	But I think a lot of people grew tired of it really fast because there was so much hype around it and how it was just going to be so much better than Halo 2.
1209295	1211235	And then it was like, eh, it's Halo 2, but prettier.
1211756	1216478	I don't think this is going to do as well because I think it's running off the same engine and also the fact that...
1217518	1225845	Unless you're a really big Halo fan, I don't know if you're going to enjoy much of the prologue to the whole Halo 3 stuff.
1228407	1236574	To me, I played through Halo and I sort of know what was going on, and this doesn't seem that interesting to me.
1238098	1239919	StarCraft 2 is getting split into three different games.
1262370	1266252	I can't believe they're going to make us pay three full games.
1266272	1270774	It's one game for the price of three, and blah, blah, I'm getting shafted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.
1271094	1274716	And I kind of look at this story about Halo 3 Recon, and I'm going, well, is this much different?
1275476	1278458	It is different because they've already had a full campaign for...
1279352	1279912	Halo 3, StarCraft 2,
1301650	1302010	Yay!
1302070	1302631	Another Halo 3!
1302691	1304092	I still think it's cheap, though.
1304112	1305512	I mean, look at, like, Red Alert.
1305552	1306613	There's a perfect example.
1306953	1310315	The game has a few different factions, and there's a storyline for each one.
1311736	1313377	You know, other games have done it.
1313598	1316319	They have, you know, multiple sides, and they have multiple storylines.
1316359	1318841	But Halo 2's single-player mode was also done like that.
1320400	1320841	Halo 3.
1321021	1323643	Right, they're slightly lackluster.
1323703	1324384	Here's the thing.
1324464	1326005	I think this should be download content.
1326025	1330369	If it's going to be running off the same engine, just have it as a downloadable game, not this retail thing.
1330589	1333351	Because now if it's retail, we can charge $59.99 for it.
1333532	1338796	A lot more than you can charge for an Xbox expansion or something like that.
1340838	1341238	I don't know.
1341318	1341659	It's just...
1342992	1351137	By the time, I guess, Halo is going to be coming out, you know, Halo 3, by the time, you know, this new game comes out, Halo 3 will probably be like $29.99.
1352538	1358281	I wouldn't be surprised if they do like a Game of the Year edition or something like that or, you know... Eventually it'll be combined.
1358301	1360162	And they're going to combine them.
1360182	1361283	Yeah, I know.
1362003	1367466	And, you know, we need one more game because, you know, what game... We need a trilogy to complete the trilogy.
1367606	1368086	Exactly.
1368327	1368787	Exactly.
1368827	1371188	You know, who doesn't want three of something?
1371589	1371769	So...
1373149	1373570	The Rob D says...
1388784	1395366	If Halo 1 had different campaigns that were all free and Halo 2 didn't, people would be complaining about it just like they are about StarCraft.
1395446	1396887	It's not even just two purchases.
1396947	1398507	It's three purchases, triple the cost.
1399587	1403368	Actdeft says it's basically what I said last week with the ACDC track pack.
1404289	1407730	SSJ100Matt says people are suckers, especially for Blizzard games.
1408590	1421516	and, uh, let's see, um... It would be different if they had, like, you know, a storyline for all of them, like a campaign, and then later on they added a new expansion that had more storyline for all the campaigns or something like that.
1421956	1423677	Break it up like that and have expansions.
1423697	1424357	People can accept expansions.
1424377	1430380	I just kind of think people are passing judgment on the StarCraft II thing too quickly without really seeing what each individual game has to offer.
1430420	1432121	They're only looking at it at face value, going...
1432641	1435002	Oh, three different games, what?
1435603	1438524	And then I'm just going, well, how is that different from most, you know?
1439265	1440866	And Rob D brings up a good point.
1440926	1443427	Like, FPSs have kind of done this for a long time.
1443507	1447710	Look at, go back to the days of Shareware and Quake.
1448050	1450431	Quake had, like, what, four different episodes?
1450491	1453353	The first one was free, but you had to pay for each of the other ones individually.
1455065	1461688	All the other four or the other three campaigns that were in there were part of the retail version.
1461768	1467891	Shareware, it's just the same as saying, okay, you get one level in this demo and then you get the other 10 when you buy the full game.
1469171	1470812	It's not an excuse for just...
1473599	1478043	I'm sorry, that's to get more money.
1478123	1482547	The whole thing is probably, oh, our game's going to be pirated to hell, so we need to sell more copies.
1482948	1483888	How do we sell more copies?
1483928	1484989	We split it up into three.
1486110	1487452	Because it's not a storage issue.
1487972	1489133	It's not a time issue.
1489393	1492496	I can tell you right now that these are probably not going to be very fleshed out.
1492917	1497421	I mean, how long can a strategy campaign last for?
1497441	1497681	I mean...
1498797	1501139	Not very long, so great.
1501439	1503440	Let's just do one for each specific thing.
1503880	1507222	If you want to do something different, just do different packaging with different...
1510879	1512340	Sides on it or something like that.
1512460	1514302	You know, collector's editions type stuff.
1514922	1516364	I'm taking a wait-and-see approach.
1516524	1521788	I mean, you know, if games can be compared to movies, sometimes movies are released in three different parts.
1522089	1524290	And, you know, we still go see all three of them.
1524310	1526652	Like the Star Wars trilogy, the new one.
1526993	1530375	Matrix trilogy, even though that is questionable about its, you know, value.
1530756	1534759	But, you know, we'll pay three times to see the full movie.
1535620	1537141	But it's a full movie.
1537181	1539043	It's not like I'm watching, you know...
1539980	1546804	Like a Batman movie, and one of the movies is from the perspective of Batman Do you not think StarCraft 2 is not going to be a full game?
1547985	1559831	I don't think, well the way it sounds like now, I don't think each one is going to be a full game They're going to call them a full game, and it'll be a full campaign for one side But it's going to feel kind of cheap, because what's the other stuff?
1559871	1564834	So say, what if I'm playing the first one and I want to play the campaign for something else?
1564934	1565855	Oh, I can't do that now
1566940	1568001	Sorry, you gotta go buy the other one.
1568421	1574885	Alright, well, if you want to give us a comment on that, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com or you can call us a little later on in the program.
1575405	1581149	For now, though, we'll move on to some more gaming news, talking about 360 and some holiday bundles that are coming out.
1581209	1581689	Hooray!
1581809	1584271	Free games now coming with your Xboxes.
1584431	1584931	Wait, wait, wait.
1584951	1586292	This is totally new news.
1587072	1588274	I know, never heard this one before.
1588314	1601350	Well, it has been confirmed, okay, that there is now a 199 arcade holiday bundle, and with it you will get Sega Superstars Tennis and five Xbox Live Arcade games that have not yet been announced.
1601510	1603432	Well, actually, I think the arcade games...
1603993	1609314	They've been actually changing a little bit because I remember when I first bought an arcade to replace my broken system.
1609794	1611555	There was a bunch of games with it now.
1611855	1616356	I actually got a new arcade system for my sister for her birthday and it had slightly different stuff.
1616536	1617836	They had Boom Boom Rocket in there.
1618196	1628539	There was Pac-Man Championship Edition, Luxor 2, Feeding Frenzy, and... A sampling.
1628819	1630099	I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same thing.
1630219	1632680	In fact, I would say it's exactly the same thing because...
1634039	1634599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1659967	1663049	The normal Xbox 360 is $2.99 or the Elite for $3.99.
1663489	1666290	You get LEGO Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda for free.
1666691	1672194	Probably those titles were selected because they're both rated E for everyone and it's the holidays.
1672214	1677076	They want to push this as a family system because that's one area where the Xbox 360 has always seemed to lack.
1677657	1679958	And to be fair, those games are actually pretty good.
1680478	1680878	Thanks for watching!
1699308	1704812	Reading a comment from Redertainment from the last story about Blizzard, and we kind of got in that little disagreement there.
1705213	1707635	All companies want to make as much money as humanly possible.
1707935	1711177	Blizzard thinks they can make mad bucks on this deal, so they are going to go through with it.
1711658	1715040	If the community says en masse that this is not the case, they will change their plans.
1715661	1716882	But the community won't.
1717222	1717622	You know it.
1717882	1718223	I know it.
1718663	1726829	Yeah, just like the community bitched and moaned, well, I should say a few individuals bitched and moaned about the Diablo 3 art style, and we got a t-shirt out of it, at least.
1727150	1727610	Yeah.
1728772	1729172	We'll see.
1729672	1736836	All right, so anyhow, yeah, so if you haven't gotten your Xbox 360 yet, you might want to wait until those package deals show up because, hey, free games.
1737316	1738536	It's hard to complain about free games.
1738556	1740837	They should be out there now, I think.
1740957	1743018	That's more than I got when I got my Xbox 360.
1744939	1748821	Well, how about something that makes me super excited about the Xbox 360?
1750287	1754435	Barbie Horse Princess Part 2 They're making a babysitting game in there?
1754735	1759444	To quote Patty from Twitter earlier, Diana Napalm Fire
1760447	1760747	No.
1762749	1765812	Tekken 6 is going to be out on Xbox 360 in fall 2009.
1766812	1768734	That makes me super happy.
1769455	1770355	Super, super happy.
1770676	1772337	Because then I don't have to get it on PlayStation 3.
1773318	1775540	But, I don't know, I might get it on PlayStation 3.
1775720	1776841	But I love Tekken.
1776981	1779283	I am the world's biggest Tekken fangirl.
1780024	1784107	And according to Microsoft, it's going to be out in fall 2009.
1784427	1788571	You know, and I don't know if it was ever announced that it was an exclusive, but that's one less exclusive that they get.
1789412	1804938	It was considered to be before PS3 exclusive, especially given that one of the demos for the PlayStation 3 was actually renderings of Jin from the Tekken series.
1806038	1811320	This was actually confirmed at the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2008 press conference for Namco Bandai.
1812340	1817682	I'm kind of curious, as a Tekken fangirl, how you feel about this announcement about Tekken going bi.
1818242	1820663	And by bi, I mean, of course, bi-systemal.
1820983	1827986	Because, you know, I had another friend of mine who's pretty into Tekken who was like, wow, that is big news for Tekken to not come out on a Sony system only.
1828266	1828987	That's huge.
1829347	1829767	No, it is.
1829867	1830207	I agree.
1831688	1840471	In fact, in the past, as far as I'm aware, every American Tekken release has been out on a Sony system.
1843141	1849225	There has been a Tekken Cardfighter game that came out in Japan on Wonderswan.
1850185	1851967	But then again, that's Bandai System.
1852147	1853067	We don't count the spin-offs.
1854328	1857350	Then we'd have to count Death by Degrees and no one wants to remember that game.
1857390	1862393	But then again, that's also in the Tekken franchise and it did only come out for...
1863314	1864194	PlayStation 2, right?
1864895	1865515	True.
1866795	1872697	I do believe, if I'm correct, there's only ever been one Tekken game that came out on a non-Sony system.
1873138	1874138	And that was the WonderSwan.
1875058	1878920	But then again, a lot of Sony franchises did come out on the WonderSwan.
1881501	1890244	For them to give that much of a nod to the Xbox 360 I think is very, very big.
1890706	1892668	Some of the chatters just want to throw this out there.
1892728	1896030	Alpha Cananogram and HitStun want to remind you there was Tekken Advance on Game Boy Advance.
1896050	1896351	That's right.
1896371	1897512	That was the other one I was trying to think of.
1897532	1899213	I actually do have that one too.
1899713	1907600	So out of, let's see, five games tag tournament, there were only two other games that came out.
1908160	1914525	Dark Resurrection came out on... With all due respect, these other two games weren't real Tekken games, quote unquote.
1914966	1919750	These other ones we're thinking of are arcade ports, the base Tekken series.
1920630	1925314	Dark Resurrection was an actual Tekken game, but that came out on PSP.
1927916	1929056	I was going to read a comment from chat.
1929217	1933640	TigerClaw in chat says, Namco has pretty much slapped Sony in the face by becoming multi-platform.
1933900	1936022	Tekken has been a PlayStation exclusive since day one.
1939544	1941566	That pretty much was it.
1941686	1948591	Especially when you had all your PlayStation releases have the compatibility with each other to go back and look at your movies and everything.
1951292	1958257	I really do think that it's a really big deal.
1958357	1972466	On top of that, I think it's also going to be... I'm not calling it a nail in the coffin for Sony, but I think it's definitely a major wake-up call that they're not doing something right.
1973147	1976249	They had been doing right when the PlayStation came out.
1976509	1978450	They had been doing right when the PS2 came out.
1978630	1979031	Am I right?
1980292	1980713	Absolutely.
1980813	1982376	Those are both fantastic systems.
1982616	1988265	As far as their sales went, their marketing strategy, as far as them coming out over the top of the competition.
1988846	1990308	And now they're sliding.
1990589	1992412	Now they're falling into the Sega pit.
1994411	1994571	XBOX 360
2021227	2023210	I don't think this is going to mean a hill of beans in Japan.
2023251	2024853	I think most people will still get it for PS3.
2025013	2027317	Keep in mind though, the Saturn did very well in Japan.
2028226	2028706	Hmm, true.
2056448	2058670	But did they have the right support over here?
2059371	2059491	No.
2060332	2061913	And what's happening to the PlayStation 3 now?
2062474	2063395	It's losing its support.
2063735	2065256	They're not doing something right.
2065857	2069400	Well, the PlayStation 3 is always going to be a Blu-ray player that plays games.
2069620	2071502	That's why I agree.
2071522	2072924	This will not put Sony out of business.
2072944	2074985	There will be a PS4, but we just kind of hope they...
2076062	2085592	If they do a PS4, I think the PS4, they're going to have to turn some shit around before they can actually make it anything that's viable for their company to bring out.
2085912	2087694	Else they're just going to have to go back to making TVs.
2088515	2092419	Alright, we're getting a little too much into the whole console war now.
2092479	2095402	And yes, GS68, bless you for Segata Sanshiro.
2097744	2099546	Segata Sanshiro was awesome.
2100171	2100871	Let's move on.
2101011	2104812	Let's go back to some more gaming news that I think will also make a lot of folks happy.
2105012	2105233	Yeah.
2105613	2110574	Well, you know, of course there are many games coming to both consoles out there.
2111174	2122238	But one date that they did announce was the release of the brand new Resident Evil 5 that will be coming to consoles March 12th.
2123118	2126999	And of course that will be coming to the 360 and on the PS3.
2128019	2129900	And it's all sorts of awesome.
2131502	2132143	Thank you for watching!
2154713	2155333	Thanks for watching!
2172330	2174751	I know a lot of people like to hate on 99 Nights.
2175011	2177412	I didn't think the game was awful.
2178032	2180393	It's kind of how I feel about Beat and Groovy in some ways.
2180453	2181413	No, actually, I don't know.
2181473	2188296	I have that same feeling of 99 Nights, there's a good game in there somewhere, but there were just a few flaws that kind of kept it from being great.
2188476	2190276	Well, look at Dynasty Warriors.
2190416	2191537	Why does that game sell?
2191577	2194558	I mean, literally, seriously, they put out...
2195598	2196138	Thanks for watching!
2217287	2221874	Your average consumer is going to look at all three of those and go, I don't get it.
2222274	2222875	What's the difference?
2223496	2225959	And really, that's kind of like with this game.
2226080	2228443	It's basically like a Dynasty Warriors clone.
2228824	2231587	So the next one comes out, I'm not expecting they're going to change much.
2231628	2233270	Hopefully fix some things and that's it.
2233410	2237213	Well, you know, they only need to fix a few more things for this game to actually be pretty kick-ass.
2237493	2238214	I enjoy myself.
2238254	2238734	I like the game.
2239234	2240776	Ranma says, Sky, don't you have 99 Nights?
2240816	2240996	I do.
2241096	2241977	I bought it the day it came out.
2242717	2246200	But I'm also, you have to remember, I'm also a whore for Q Entertainment.
2246340	2247080	I mean, seriously.
2247541	2250363	Anything Mizuguchi does, I'm gonna buy.
2250683	2252605	Because he's one of my favorite game designers.
2253345	2253926	Except Gunpei.
2254006	2255847	I never got Gunpei for some reason, but it's on my list.
2255867	2259810	Can you imagine how awesome Beat and Groovy would have been if Q Entertainment had made it?
2260150	2260271	Pfft.
2261491	2289366	I think Q Entertainment should make a game done right anyway anyway that's for another day but obviously 99 Nights as much as I want to say it's not as bad as y'all think okay definitely the game had it's flaws it did get boring after a while I just hope they can fix some of it with 99 Nights too there's a good game in there somewhere and I hope people don't totally pass it off on name alone because hey sometimes games don't get really really good until the sequel for instance Mega Man
2290086	2291707	Mega Man 2 Mega Man 2 Mega Man 2 Mega Man 2
2321426	2323727	Every week there's some damn rumor about it, yes.
2323768	2326810	Well, here is the official word.
2327170	2327911	Dun, dun, dun.
2328571	2332815	This is a quote from one of Microsoft's representatives.
2333115	2339300	It says, As we've said before, Microsoft has no plans to introduce an Xbox 360 Blu-ray add-on.
2339901	2347427	Games are what drive consumers to purchase game consoles, and we remain focused on providing the largest library of blockbuster games available.
2347907	2349549	And that's a direct quote.
2350009	2354031	Allow me to translate to all the bloggers around America and throughout the world, really.
2354051	2354811	I want to provide my translation.
2354851	2355632	Oh, please, go ahead.
2355792	2356972	Shut the fuck up!
2357172	2358853	That's exactly what I was gonna say.
2359313	2362375	Shut the fuck up about the Blu-ray on Microsoft.
2362415	2364095	It is not happening.
2364175	2370058	And if it is gonna happen, we'll fucking tell you a long time from now because it's just not something we're interested in right now.
2370078	2378222	The whole thing that brought that up was that there had been a rumor that Microsoft had commissioned the hardware to be made with a Toshiba Samsung.
2379203	2381046	Um, but, no!
2381768	2382549	And you wanna know what?
2382770	2384573	I love my HD DVD player on it.
2385054	2390104	But, going back to what I was previously saying about what Sony is doing wrong...
2391178	2393939	I think that's what Sony's doing wrong.
2394380	2395740	They're not focusing on the games.
2395780	2398942	And that's what Microsoft is doing right.
2399362	2401383	Well, but is that necessarily a bad thing?
2401403	2405045	Because I look at the PSP and I go, eh, not my favorite gaming system first.
2405165	2408547	But the PSP does a lot of cool shit that I like.
2408887	2410408	It's kind of like an all-in-one little device.
2410428	2415290	I can name people off the top of my head who've bought the PSP not as a gaming system but as a multimedia system.
2415330	2415871	Exactly.
2416291	2419813	But when I think handheld game system, I think of my DS.
2419853	2419993	Right.
2420413	2426266	But what's so wrong with the PlayStation 3 taking that same kind of concept about being a home entertainment device?
2427344	2432468	Because when someone's going to buy a console, it is going to be because they can play games on it.
2433168	2437311	That is, I think, the end all of what a video game console is.
2437952	2445377	It can have all these nice, pretty special bells and whistles, but in the end, no matter what, what do we always say?
2445458	2448119	The console is only as good as the games that are on it.
2448480	2453984	If they're not putting good games on it, what good is the damn console other than just playing a movie?
2454545	2459668	I know somebody who owns a PlayStation 3 for nothing but Blu-ray.
2459828	2462889	They don't own a single video game, just the Blu-ray player because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.
2462909	2464770	It's astounding.
2464790	2465651	It's like, what's the point?
2467527	2469088	You can buy Blu-ray players.
2469428	2476710	One other thing I kind of want to point out, you know, Microsoft has a high-definition movie download service and they're rolling out Netflix pretty soon.
2477631	2479251	Do they really want a Blu-ray player?
2479852	2480572	Probably not.
2480752	2484673	They probably want to go to this whole digital distribution thing because there's a lot of money to be made there.
2484693	2485413	I think that's where it's going.
2485433	2487314	I really do think that that's the future of our media.
2490215	2495877	You know, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised that 10 years down the line, you'll have a hard time picking up physical media.
2496057	2498098	It's all going to be downloadable content.
2499299	2499519	All right.
2499539	2500339	Well, there you have it.
2500419	2501039	No Blu-ray.
2501099	2503580	So you just stop spreading rumors about it.
2503700	2504901	Shut up, please.
2505501	2510043	Meantime, though, we got a lot of other releases coming out that are confirmed and will be happening.
2510063	2510483	Right, Loki?
2510923	2515065	Yes, there's plenty of stuff coming out because we're now in the fourth quarter of
2515605	2518489	which is where all the game companies like to hide their games.
2519170	2526118	And starting off, and of course there's a lot of crap out there, Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune for the Wii.
2526639	2527820	Looks like a piece of shit.
2528782	2531905	And Avatar, please tell us how you really feel.
2532586	2533707	Well, okay, let me put it this way.
2533727	2536368	It's by a company called Zoo Games, and all their games have sucked.
2537608	2540710	Avatar, The Last Airbender, Into the Inferno.
2541070	2546512	Hopefully the achievements take a little longer to get than, say, the last game where you could get them all in about five minutes.
2547593	2550974	And that'll be out on the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.
2552155	2555976	Blitz League 2 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.
2555996	2561099	Attack the Guardians of Gross on the Wii and PlayStation 2.

2595950	2597394	I just drank.
2597976	2598437	Oh, God.

2728857	2730558	Dead Space coming out on PlayStation.

2990086	2992453	Alright, so there you go, your Japanese release dates.
2993215	2996724	Let's head over to the other pond across the Atlantic this time.
2997452	3001294	Well, on the 13th comes Equestrian Training on the DS.
3001334	3004856	That would be, I think that's today now over there, so oops.
3005717	3009839	On the 17th, Golden Axe Beast Rider on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3010820	3013781	Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 on Damn Near Everything.
3014682	3019385	Rapala Fishing Frenzy, whatever, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3019825	3023527	Saints Row 2 for PlayStation 3 PC and Xbox 360.
3023747	3026029	And What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver on DS.
3026949	3028349	So, that would be it.
3029230	3030970	I think that's coming out here in a few weeks, too.
3031991	3034051	I have absolutely zero interest in that.
3034071	3034691	Because you know what?
3035532	3037032	I have a kitchen and I have food.
3037532	3038533	And I know how to cook.
3039253	3040153	I have Iron Chef.
3041373	3042454	I have the Iron Chef book.
3042894	3043534	It's awesome.
3043694	3044434	That little red book?
3044854	3045235	Yeah.
3045255	3045775	Isn't that great?
3045975	3049336	I want to actually try making the humbar lobster dish that was in there.
3049916	3051216	If I have $1,000.
3051336	3052657	Enough about Iron Chef.
3053557	3056038	But if we are going to talk about Iron Chef, the secret ingredient is...
3056718	3063162	More skins for LittleBigPlanet and GameStop is sweetening the deal with their pre-orders.
3063542	3071788	Before you could get your Kratos skin on or at least the different parts of it to create your own Kratos Sackboy.
3072308	3080933	But now you'll be getting also a Medusa, looks like a skin set there, and costumes for, looks like a Minotaur.
3081974	3082915	So that's pretty awesome.
3083695	3088339	And those will be available when the game is released a couple weeks from now.
3089000	3089800	So that's pretty sweet.
3089981	3092322	And then, of course, Tokyo Game Show.
3093243	3094964	They were showing off a few more things.
3097126	3101229	Skins for Solid Snake from, of course, Metal Gear Solid.
3101790	3105733	And from Final Fantasy VII, they have Sephiroth.
3107274	3107815	Oh, joy.
3109016	3109636	No cloud, though.
3109816	3110497	I don't understand why.
3110967	3111808	How are you going to have a battle?
3111888	3112869	Oh my god, you know what that means.
3112889	3115331	There's going to be a Final Fantasy VII remake on PlayStation 3.
3115371	3115851	This is proof.
3117653	3119114	And it's going to be done with Sackboys.
3120035	3123678	It's like Potter Puppet Pals, but for the next gen.
3124158	3125620	That would be the best game ever.
3126540	3127601	That actually would be kind of awesome.
3127641	3128582	Final Fantasy Puppet Pals.
3129763	3130123	The game.
3130224	3130984	Very, very awesome.
3132345	3132966	Cool, cool.
3133366	3135488	Do you have your LittleBigPlanet pre-ordered?
3135548	3136269	Are you getting this, Loki?
3136449	3136849	Yes, I am.
3138686	3140107	Redertainment in chat is kind of pissed.
3140127	3140867	He says Sephiroth?
3140907	3141367	No Cloud?
3141387	3141908	What the fuck?
3143108	3143569	Give it time.
3143949	3144749	Cloud will be later.
3145390	3148291	Cloud comes with your Final Fantasy VII Remake pre-order.
3148351	3148711	Duh.
3149572	3149932	Hello?
3151093	3153614	By the way, speaking of LittleBigPlanet, some other news.
3154294	3160338	There was a little bit of will they, won't they with the beta and will the levels made in the beta be playable in the final game?
3160378	3162459	And the answer is... Unicron.
3163726	3164787	No, the answer is yes.
3165688	3175115	And it was confirmed to 1UP because they're able to get confirmations from big developers that indeed the things that people have been making in the beta, they will transfer over to the final game.
3177076	3183521	Apparently, though, they're kind of gauging how people feel about this news on the official PlayStation forums, so they might change their mind.
3183541	3184582	Why would you not like this idea?
3185563	3187785	Because they want everybody to start on the same page.
3188305	3189306	That's dumb.
3189326	3191588	You don't have access to all the same stuff in the beta, right?
3192208	3196629	Yeah, I'd say it's win-win, because you start the game, there's a ton of fucking content to download.
3196929	3197269	Exactly.
3197289	3198109	Why would that be bad?
3198770	3199310	That's good.
3199550	3200990	Now I can play Bobby's level.
3201450	3206632	Bobby Blackwolf, of course, the man who does the show before us here on All Games Radio, he actually made a little level that's cute.
3207012	3210412	It's like the quest, because there's a YouTube of it somewhere, if you look up his YouTube account.
3211013	3213013	It's like the quest to get a beta code.
3213393	3213893	And it's funny.
3214253	3214473	It's cute.
3214493	3215594	It kind of shows what you can do with the game.
3215934	3216374	Because, you know...
3216994	3220116	We had that little demo at Penny Arcade Expo and kind of got to play the game.
3220136	3221497	We didn't get to see a lot of the editor.
3221877	3224018	We really didn't get to see a lot about editing the levels.
3224378	3226359	It was kind of cool to see what you can really create.
3226399	3228760	I don't know how much time he spent on that, but I imagine it wasn't that much.
3230501	3233903	I have the Wall of Awesome levels in there with my picture on it.
3233923	3234303	What levels?
3234503	3234704	What?
3234724	3235384	Remember?
3235684	3238986	Because I beat the developer at that little mini game thing that he did.
3239186	3239686	Oh, yeah.
3239766	3241007	I got a picture on the Wall of Awesome.
3241667	3242048	Oh, maybe.
3242728	3244269	But maybe that was just for Penny Arcade Expo.
3244289	3244549	Who knows?
3244969	3245289	Yeah.
3246030	3246410	Perhaps.
3247105	3247405	Awesome.
3248566	3249126	Well, there you go.
3250006	3250726	We'll be looking for that.
3251387	3255468	I'm finally going to have to crack and buy a PlayStation 3 in a couple weeks, finally, I think, because I do want this game.
3259129	3260630	I was just thinking about that, actually.
3260870	3261150	How so?
3261610	3264411	You know, that was for SingStar, right?
3265071	3266112	No, no, for LittleBigPlanet.
3266352	3268053	I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.
3268093	3269813	No, I was thinking about SingStar, though.
3270093	3272894	Because I've also, okay, because I've also talked about... Because you wanted the ABBA.
3272914	3274535	Right, because I want SingStar ABBA, so...
3275503	3279646	My brain was doing that thing where it jumps topics without me actually saying anything about it.
3280007	3280587	No, it's fine.
3280607	3281468	I have said that before.
3282188	3283689	But I was thinking about that.
3284130	3286852	Are those the only two games that you're interested in to get the system?
3289133	3291175	For right now, but I'm also interested in Home.
3291735	3294257	I think Home's going to be kind of cool.
3294377	3296158	We'll see what kind of comes up next year.
3296899	3299080	I was just wondering if that would really be your only two reasons.
3300381	3300541	But...
3301978	3303120	and the fact it's a Blu-ray player.
3303300	3304301	I can benefit from that too.
3304982	3306263	There's enough for me.
3307384	3310668	Well, we've been discussing the PSP earlier.
3310708	3313431	Well, here's something that we finally have a confirmation on.
3314672	3321780	Yoshida Shuhei has said it himself that Gran Turismo PSP is in development but
3324703	3327225	There's actually no real date on it yet.
3329226	3333309	In fact, according to this article, when he was asked about it, he actually said, good question.
3334490	3337572	It's in Polyphony Digital, and they're working on it.
3337752	3343897	So at any rate, they say that the reason that it's been delayed is because Polyphony's been working on other projects.
3346779	3351442	But they have been working on Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Gran Turismo 5 for PS3.
3352022	3361068	So they were actually working on the PS3 as their priority and not the PSP one.
3362549	3366231	But when he was asked when it would be, he said, no comment.
3367692	3374377	That's a lame excuse, I think, because this has been in development since before the PSP was released.
3375345	3376245	So come on, man.
3376506	3377066	Seriously.
3377526	3380187	It's been in development for a long time now.
3380227	3381768	It'll be out when Duke Nukem Forever is out.
3382028	3384369	They have to make the graphics extra pretty, remember?
3384749	3385730	Oh, my ass.
3386030	3398636	It's just like they were saying, Oh, well, we don't know how to make the cars take damage and stuff, and the car manufacturers don't want us to dirty up their cars and stuff yet.
3398796	3403118	Other games have the same licensed cars and realistic damage modeling.
3404514	3413740	excuses, excuses, excuses and you know what, by the time your stupid game is released, no one will care the end the end
3415188	3422253	But one thing you can do in the meantime with your PSP, since you won't be playing Gran Turismo on it, is you can use it as a secondary monitor.
3422613	3440525	Thanks to the Homebrew community, they have released an app, and I know there's another one out there that's also part of something else that can do the same thing, but PSP DISP version 0.1 allows you to connect your PSP to your PC via the USB cable and use it as a secondary monitor.
3440765	3443767	It's able to display graphics.
3443787	3444768	How would you fit on it?
3445728	3469994	graphics of 960 by 544 it's just you have to kind of move the you know pan the image around but you can do that and you can it's supported of course only on the custom firmwares of course you know 4.01 m33 so above so wait while I have like let's say while I have World of Warcraft going on my main computer screen I could have wow head up in a browser window on my secondary screen yes that's kind of neat
3474266	3474726	It's cheap.
3474966	3478607	It's good for visualizations or whatever.
3478747	3482168	If you're working on something and you want to view something on your other screen.
3483089	3484869	What if you're designing a PSP website?
3486130	3488410	That doesn't work.
3489791	3493392	PSP doesn't display stuff quite like... You see what I was trying to get at though.
3493652	3499974	You've designed the lovely olrpsp.com which includes the all games radio player so you can listen to us on your PSP live on Sunday nights.
3500623	3505628	Yeah, unfortunately the PSP does not display stuff the same as your PC.
3505648	3511775	It makes it kind of difficult because you have to constantly tweak stuff and then refresh, tweak stuff, refresh.
3514698	3519604	Well, look, one thing that you're going to be able to enjoy a lot more on your PSP, and it doesn't even have to run custom firmware...
3519944	3521385	and LocoRoco2.
3521706	3525929	Come on, you knew it was coming because Sony really hyped up the first LocoRoco game.
3525949	3526690	You knew it was coming.
3527050	3528151	You know what's kind of interesting though?
3528612	3531174	The game has also been confirmed for Europe as well as Japan.
3531374	3532595	Obviously, we all know it's going there.
3532916	3537139	But the thing is that actually the game is going to be coming out first in Europe.
3537620	3539361	The game is coming out in November.
3539581	3540042	That's right.
3540482	3545165	November in Europe and no date announced yet for Japan as far as I know.
3545286	3547087	I believe it might be early next year.
3548228	3552791	So those of you folks over in Europe that always complain you get the shaft, Sony loves you!
3553211	3554732	They're giving you LocoRoco 2 first.
3555673	3556053	There you go.
3557274	3558515	LocoRoco is awesome.
3560276	3563521	No word about the American release, though, which is kind of sad.
3563541	3564342	We better get it.
3564422	3565223	I would think that we did.
3565364	3566085	I don't see why we wouldn't.
3566105	3567467	It did so much better here than it did there.
3567567	3568428	The question is when.
3568488	3569670	Will we have to wait till last?
3569690	3570251	Will we be in between?
3570271	3572635	Well, LocoRoco came out here last time.
3572655	3574257	Oh, wait, no, that's Patapon.
3574618	3574958	Never mind.
3575439	3576780	Which is also getting a sequel.
3576840	3578221	That's what Actdeft just said in chat.
3578301	3579261	Chat.org.com.
3579301	3580442	Patapon 2 is also coming.
3580602	3580842	Yes.
3581122	3581962	Pon, pon, patapon.
3583643	3586325	Well, our next bit of news makes me super happy.
3587245	3589987	That is, if it doesn't suck as much as some of the other later releases did.
3590147	3593569	But there's going to be a new Castlevania game on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3594709	3601012	And it's... They actually showed about 10 seconds of footage of it.
3601813	3601993	And...
3602573	3603754	and no gameplay.
3603974	3604815	It was nothing.
3605435	3609037	It's being produced by Igarashi and he's my hero and I got to meet him.
3609538	3610258	It made me so happy.
3612239	3613220	So maybe it's going to be good.
3613260	3620164	I'm actually more excited about the other one that's coming out on handheld.
3622005	3623826	Oh yeah, Order of Elysia.
3624367	3624767	Oh yeah!
3625267	3629110	Itagashi and Itagaki should get together and form a death metal band.
3629130	3630210	I think it would be awesome.
3630851	3631231	Don't you think?
3632519	3633640	Idagaki and Igarashi?
3634841	3637062	Yes, Igarashi and Idagaki.
3637082	3639504	The Dead or Alive guy and the Castlevania guy should get together and form a death metal band.
3639524	3640285	Dude, he's such a rock star.
3640325	3641886	He's on the picture here.
3641926	3642226	They are.
3642847	3646489	Wearing a leather cowboy hat and holding a whip.
3646609	3647950	And I'm like, dude, you're hot.
3648010	3650092	And then Mizuguchi can play keyboards.
3651433	3653014	And then who'd be the singer?
3653214	3654555	What game designer would be the singer for that band?
3654575	3655636	Posting the picture in the chat room?
3656196	3657577	Because, dude, I'm sorry.
3658197	3659398	He looks like a freaking rock star.
3660419	3661540	He is a freaking rock star.
3663373	3666015	That's why I'm thinking... Yes, and Dark Tasuya says, and do a game.
3666055	3667415	They should all come together and do a game.
3668056	3670217	I would die of... I would have a fangasm right there.
3670277	3671818	I don't know, but they would never agree.
3673299	3674560	They would kill each other first.
3675280	3683145	I bet if you gave them both the same premise of the game, we'd get something fucked up from both of them, but in different ways.
3684726	3687307	TheRobD says Miyamoto would be the conductor.
3688688	3689929	Inafume is the singer.
3690930	3691390	It's funny.
3692498	3693459	Anyhow, we'll see.
3693799	3698781	But anyway, before our dream game designer death metal band becomes true, we'll see probably Castlevania.
3698801	3700982	Current gen.
3701122	3703023	Idagaki is the Gene Simmons of the gaming world.
3704924	3705345	Perfect.
3705885	3707746	The Gene Simmons of the gaming world.
3708126	3708466	Perfect.
3708506	3709427	He needs a reality show.
3709827	3710347	Alright.
3712028	3712208	PSP Plus
3734217	3757217	and using Resistance Retribution via USB cable connecting it to your PS3 you will actually be able to use your DualShock 3 controller and play the game just using that and then you can also unlock abilities that are in Resistance 2, the character in that game
3757897	3776527	Nathan Hale you'll be able to unlock the same abilities for your character in this game and will also allow you to get to different parts of levels and stuff like that kind of think a little bit like the stuff they have with Sonic & Knuckles where you can plug in the other Sonic games and get to different portions of the game and stuff like that so that's kind of cool
3778080	3787883	and I guess this would also fix that problem with not having the second analog stick because it does change the controls around since you have that second analog stick to look around.
3788784	3796806	Or how about they just redesign the PSP with a second analog stick instead of having this roundabout way that requires a PlayStation 3 as well.
3799767	3800428	I'll check it out though.
3800968	3803408	Yeah, I mean you're still going to get this game no matter what, right?
3803428	3804189	Resistance 2 will.
3804589	3804749	Yeah.
3806265	3810168	Anyhow, also, moving on to one more story on the PSP, and then we're going to get towards our break time tonight.
3810868	3813150	On the PSP, there is the Wi-Fi store.
3813170	3814971	Remember we've been talking about the Wi-Fi store this coming?
3814991	3816051	Hey, the date has been announced.
3816312	3822916	October 15th, the Wi-Fi store will be launched in Japan, but you know that it's not much longer before it's here.
3823356	3829680	And that probably is in line with the fact that the PSP 3000 comes out this week as well, so don't think there's not a correlation there.
3829980	3830461	With the 5.5?
3831942	3834203	5.0 firmware will also be the same time.
3834363	3837765	The Wi-Fi store is already on the box art for the PSP 3000.
3838766	3844330	Which makes sense because if the PSP 3000 doesn't hit street until October 16th, they're basically launching this the day before.
3844910	3845330	There you go.
3845991	3849633	Some games that are going to be sold on the store that already are dated.
3850134	3856458	Secret Agent Clank on November 20th, Patapon 2 on November 27th, and LocoRoco 2 on December 4th.
3856798	3858399	There's that date I was looking for earlier.
3858479	3860561	So yeah, Europe's getting it by a couple weeks.
3861521	3862402	And I'll see you next time.
3875803	3881364	Usually those firmware updates, they're all about the same time, like within a day of each other.
3881944	3888806	All right, so anyhow, the Wi-Fi store is going to be opening soon, and also opening soon is Part B of our show.
3888846	3894367	But before we get to Part B of our radio show, we need to get to the classic video game of the week.
3894667	3901989	It's a little segment we do here every week on this program where DarkSakura takes a look through history's past to find a game for us to look at.
3905410	3907812	So tell us, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?
3908433	3913999	Well, if anyone could guess from the music... They won't hear that on the podcast, by the way.
3914019	3915320	I want to edit that little boo-boo out.
3916181	3920285	Well, then I would totally give them a cookie, you know, a virtual cookie.
3920705	3924069	But the game of the week is K.O.U.
3924089	3927032	Gekitai, which came out over here as Chaos Flying Squadron.
3929552	3939480	It's a game of a girl who has this ancestral obligation to go destroy monsters while riding on the back of her lazy little dragon friend.
3940701	3942443	Her dragon is named Pulchi.
3943163	3949889	In the American version and the UK version, he was called Spot.
3950810	3952632	Funny, I don't see a Spot.
3953786	3959130	Her special outfit, though, that she has to wear for destroying evil is a bunny girl suit.
3960551	3965315	So, um... It came out... We actually got it as K.O.
3965355	3969358	Flying Squadron on the Sega CD over here.
3969398	3970699	There's also K.O.
3970739	3974502	Yugekitai Katsugekihen, which was K.O.
3974542	3976443	Flying Squadron 2, which was on Saturn.
3976483	3976984	That's the game.
3977164	3978044	I actually own that one.
3979165	3980566	There was also K.O.
3980606	3981827	Yugekitai Okira...
3982848	3986613	Tamatai Bako, which is like a demo CD.
3987194	3997066	And then there was Rami-chan no Oedo's Sugoroku Keiou Gekisai Gaiden, which was like a special bonus story for Rami, who is the little girl in the game.
3997767	3997948	So...
3998908	3999849	It is a little shooting game.
3999889	4007953	It's a cutesy little shooting game where, like I said, she rides on the back of the dragon and she has a large mallet for hitting enemies.
4008453	4013496	She has an umbrella for hitting enemies and a bow so she can shoot arrows at enemies.
4014016	4017878	Rami can bounce on enemies' heads and kill them that way.
4017898	4023260	You can also shoot at them and you get little bonus buddies to help you.
4023280	4024361	I guess it's like your options.
4024401	4025682	That was in Chaos Flag Squadron 2.
4028185	4034956	The first one had, it was basically just a few less options with that since it was very limited.
4035296	4037640	And all this audio in it, of course, was Redbook audio.
4037861	4039323	Are those pigs that look like people?
4039884	4040144	Yes.
4040565	4040805	Cool.
4042399	4045901	Um, so they're very fun little games.
4046302	4060531	Um, there's also, um, in, uh, KO Flying Squadron 2, there's another character called Himiko, um, who made, like, a, uh, a robot called the Psy V, and she was, like, KO's, uh, rival.
4061051	4061952	I'm not KO, why did I say KO?
4061972	4062673	Rami's rival.
4063393	4068997	Um, and then there were, there was, uh, an intelligent raccoon who was their enemy, who was a member of Greenpeace.
4071098	4073559	And he's from Mexico.
4075440	4076321	A raccoon from Mexico.
4076381	4077681	He's a member of Greenpeace.
4078622	4081063	He's the bad guy.
4081083	4083944	So that's... This looks kind of cute.
4084204	4085885	I've never heard of this game in my life.
4085905	4086545	It's cracked out cute.
4086565	4090907	Because I didn't really follow the whole Sega empire until years later.
4090967	4091508	But this is cute.
4092714	4092974	DarkSakura.com
4118717	4119457	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
4149063	4152426	I would say live from BlizzCon, but that can't happen because BlizzCon is now over.
4152786	4154648	So, not live from BlizzCon.
4155208	4159071	So, we'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4177964	4179225	Did you see the debate this week?
4179245	4181387	Dude, Tom Brokaw was the man, okay?
4181407	4182568	Tom Brokaw was very fierce.
4182649	4184010	Okay, he ruled the debate.
4184250	4185031	He ruled the entire debate.
4185051	4186152	He won the debate, actually.
4186372	4186713	He did.
4186773	4187433	In my opinion.
4187453	4188454	He's gonna be the next president.
4188474	4190476	He's like, do you see those fucking lights on the ground?
4191197	4193319	When they get red, STFU!
4194020	4195001	God, I never... Bukkake!
4198924	4199185	Anyhow.
4200441	4202003	We got some gaming news to get back into.
4202063	4203444	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4203825	4206127	Hope you enjoyed that music break for those of you guys listening live.
4206147	4207609	If you're not listening live, why not?
4208229	4209911	You should join us on Sunday nights live.
4210251	4214736	You can even listen to us on the go thanks to the OLR PSP website that has the all games radio player.
4215017	4217199	I think some folks are listening to us on iPhones as well.
4217219	4219121	I think there's some application you can use to do that.
4219701	4220882	Some type of tuning program.
4221703	4222543	So, pretty awesome.
4223664	4225205	But we got some more gaming news to cover.
4225426	4227247	We got a BlizzCon report to get to.
4227787	4232671	Actually, first off though, since we've been talking about conventions, I want to start this segment off before we get to the actual gaming news.
4233231	4242799	Reading responses to our Twitter question, the pre-OLR twit, for those of us following, for those of you guys following us on Twitter at twitter.com slash OLR, we asked the question tonight...
4243499	4244119	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4265049	4265329	Let's see.
4265369	4268152	Javier Altman says, Yes, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show.
4268252	4268573	Why?
4268953	4271816	To get into the panties of as many booth babes as humanly possible.
4271876	4272997	Them love Latin cock.
4273077	4273418	Oh, yeah.
4274038	4275440	That was a nice G-Radio response.
4275800	4277122	DarkTetsuya says, Hell, yes.
4277242	4281887	I've always wanted to go to Japan anyway, but an event like TGS with all the newest Japanese games do want...
4283104	4286367	Marin Marvel says, heck yes, I could go if I could.
4286707	4289749	Squeenix and Konami are bound to unveil some awesome things at Tokyo Game Show.
4289789	4290630	Plus, you know it's Tokyo.
4291671	4294653	Actdeft says, yes, it's basically E3, but done way better.
4294713	4296694	So it's basically all the great announcements we hear.
4296775	4297975	I would like to hear them firsthand.
4298836	4302119	Jacksonman says, I'm from Kentucky, so going anywhere but here would be nice.
4303800	4305821	Crows says, of course I want to go.
4305921	4308003	Japanese games almost always have more.
4308403	4311125	I want to go and learn which upcoming games have little anime girls.
4312732	4315416	Geovidea says, oh hell yes, it's Japan.
4315456	4317138	I've been trying to get there for a few years now.
4317618	4319681	MistyOLR says, admittedly, not really.
4319921	4323646	I have ASEN and I can actually afford that con compared to going all the way to Japan.
4324067	4326310	A nice realistic answer from Misty.
4326991	4329274	Joosten says, nah, it's all about packs.
4329774	4331595	I did E3 a few times when it was good.
4331655	4334056	That's enough OMG game show spectacle for me.
4334516	4336336	So surprisingly, a couple people saying no.
4336476	4340338	I would have assumed that it would have been right 100% yeses across the board.
4340798	4342399	So surprises abound on our Twitter.
4342939	4343599	Thanks for the responses, folks.
4343619	4347720	I think the whole reason that I would really want to go is to go hang out with my friends that live over there.
4349981	4352422	Yeah, just to go somewhere else.
4353142	4354003	I've never been to Japan.
4354023	4354523	It would be fun.
4355219	4362559	I mean, because really after having been to E3 all those years it really is a big spectacle that type of thing, don't you think?
4363443	4364664	There's something about being there.
4364684	4365704	It's like magic in the air.
4365965	4366225	I don't know.
4366245	4367385	It makes you more excited about everything.
4367405	4369406	More like unwashed fanboys in the air over here.
4369526	4370027	Oh, shush.
4370887	4374229	All right, let's get back into some gaming news now that we've heard from you Twitter folks tonight.
4374589	4374869	Loki.
4375249	4375570	All right.
4376030	4389037	Well, this is sort of a rumor right now, but apparently the website tinycartridge.com is reporting that they have found a trademark registered in Japan for...
4390078	4391839	What is called DS Scan.
4392219	4401508	And what they theorize it is, is it's something that's going to be used with the DSi's camera to unlock DS content.
4401748	4407713	Now, one of the things that they're also speculating is that it's for use with QR codes.
4408214	4413278	Which those who do not know, QR codes are those square, kind of pixely looking...
4413979	4414800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4432089	4442414	Reveal more information like some examples are nutritional information on food, directions on Google Maps, contact details, business cards, etc.
4442914	4446616	Or even links to different game developer sites and stuff like that.
4446956	4450878	So that would be a pretty cool feature, especially since the DSi is going to have a built-in web browser.
4450918	4453139	I could see something like that actually being implemented.
4453940	4457841	So right now, it's all speculation to see how that's going to work.
4460094	4460374	I don't know.
4460694	4462195	Interesting comments from the chat room.
4462775	4466317	Frisbee in chat, chat.org.com says, DSI e-reader.
4466737	4469699	And Unfolded Raptor says, sad thing, I actually bought an e-reader.
4469759	4470639	What a waste of money.
4472220	4474441	Actdeft says, I have some Animal Crossing e-reader cards.
4474461	4475622	Whatever happened to the e-reader?
4476222	4478663	I think it's one of those peripherals that they didn't really support that much.
4478963	4480444	But could this be something like that?
4480464	4481585	This could be something like that.
4481705	4483106	Like, they could release cards.
4483586	4485107	I would think it would be kind of cool...
4487775	4504280	Before, remember, they were talking about doing something with the DS version of Viva Pinata, where they were going to have images that appear on the DS, and you can scan them with your Xbox 360 camera and import your characters into that.
4504340	4506121	Well, now you can do it vice versa that way.
4506321	4509442	Oh, but I'm getting total value for my Xbox 360 camera right now.
4509482	4511483	I mean, did you see camera mode in Beat and Groovy?
4511963	4512643	Wahoo!
4513503	4514064	Oh, I'm sorry.
4514104	4514664	I missed that.
4515740	4517281	What was camera mode in Beat and Groovy?
4517761	4519062	Now you hit balloons.
4519222	4520944	It's just... Lame.
4520964	4521304	Awesome.
4521324	4522144	Tacked on junk.
4522545	4530010	No, actually, sadly enough, I'm going to be coming into contact with another camera because I'm buying that game, You're in the Movies.
4531090	4531450	Why?
4531931	4532931	Because it looks fun.
4533011	4534272	It's like a fun party game.
4534613	4534973	Alright.
4535593	4539516	And it unfortunately comes with another camera, so now I have two useless cameras.
4540937	4541737	Congratulations?
4542518	4542698	Yeah.
4542718	4542798	Yeah.
4544332	4548536	Well, how about some other Nintendo news that you can really get excited about coming out of Tokyo Game Show?
4549077	4552219	No More Heroes 2 is coming out.
4552300	4553701	Now, here's the thing, though.
4555382	4558926	Actually, it wasn't really necessarily confirmed for the Nintendo Wii.
4558986	4559566	Yeah, it's for the Wii.
4559707	4560247	Is it?
4560307	4561248	Oh, okay.
4561268	4563951	Because I remember when they saw the trailer, it didn't say Wii anywhere in it.
4564511	4566312	So some people were actually speculating a little bit.
4566352	4568674	But all right, it sounds like it was confirmed for the Wii, which makes sense.
4568934	4569495	You know, it makes sense.
4570776	4573378	No More Heroes Desperate Struggle is the name of the game.
4573658	4577400	See, people thought it might have been for the DS because, you know, Desperate Struggle, DS.
4578161	4579322	Oh, good thought, yeah.
4579542	4580823	So, okay, yeah, that makes sense.
4581023	4584185	And, of course, there's folks wishful thinking it would be on 360 or PlayStation 3.
4584926	4585566	I wish it were.
4586187	4586587	It's another...
4587848	4588709	It's another Wii game.
4588850	4591253	You played a lot of the first No More Heroes game, Loki.
4591273	4591994	Are you excited?
4592595	4593356	Yeah, I am excited.
4593416	4594257	I thought it looks awesome.
4594357	4596260	And I just wish, though, it was on the 360.
4597462	4599044	Because it'd be even more awesome.
4599665	4600346	More awesomer?
4601269	4609632	Yeah, actually, you know, I wish a lot of the games that they're putting on the Wii were on, like, the 360 or PS3, like No More Heroes, Mad World.
4610072	4614073	Well, here's what's strange, and, you know, again, here's a story that didn't really make show world tonight.
4614093	4620495	It's just been a busy week, but there's rumors going around about the Wii HD again, and the successor to Nintendo Wii is coming out in 2011.
4621095	4623416	I don't know why this rumor has suddenly caught more steam.
4624336	4627857	And you know who I was looking at was being sourced for the rumor?
4628137	4629438	Get this, whattheyplay.com.
4630498	4631559	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4655952	4658113	Yes, of course there's going to be a follow-up to the Wii system.
4658133	4660215	I mean, the thing has sold millions and jillions.
4660615	4661716	Of course there's going to be a follow-up.
4661736	4662677	It's just a question of when.
4662737	4666760	So people like to pull dates out of their fucking butts as to when it's coming.
4667381	4671644	And, you know, if they're off, they'll just say, oh, it just got delayed.
4672405	4673585	Or, oh, they're putting it out early.
4673605	4675667	It's just a bunch of crap.
4675807	4677208	Of course there's going to be a Wii follow-up.
4677308	4677969	Why is this news?
4678409	4681852	I saw it, like, on the front page of Yahoo as the successor to the Wii.
4682492	4682993	Who cares?
4684554	4685395	When was that new?
4686075	4686795	I know, for real.
4686895	4687436	Anyway, sorry.
4687456	4690418	It says, when is Yahoo known for reporting game news?
4690458	4693840	Look, I use their mail service, so I see the stuff on the page of their site.
4693860	4695401	I know, I completely understand.
4697122	4698583	It was a little weird to me, that's all.
4699723	4708749	Especially since they're trying to sell some new video gaming news thing, and if that's your cutting edge story, I weep for the future.
4709629	4709889	Anyhow.
4710310	4711731	I weep all the time anyway.
4712191	4712371	Nice.
4712967	4717908	Well, Nintendo Points are not going to transfer between the Wii and the DSi.
4718508	4720349	It is official.
4721429	4722669	They have their own points.
4723929	4724729	And let me guess.
4724789	4735132	It'll be one of those things where I have to buy $10 or $20 worth of points at a time, and then the games will cost just enough so that I have like $300 left over at any given time.
4735692	4736032	Correct?
4736912	4737412	That's correct.
4740238	4764533	well basically that that pretty much is yeah but they have to be separate yeah it's totally impossible for a service to do that it's not like you know companies like Microsoft have I don't know Microsoft points that you can use on both Xbox marketplace or I don't know the Zune marketplace it's totally impossible that technology does not exist more like they just don't want to
4765097	4765697	Thanks for watching!
4783124	4788226	Redertainment says in chat, it's like selling six hot dogs to a pack by eight buns to a pack.
4788566	4788706	Exactly.
4788726	4789667	That's a perfect analogy.
4790307	4792848	AlphaCatanogram says it's all Nintendo points now.
4792868	4793528	That's what I thought.
4793608	4794628	I thought it was going to be all Nintendo points.
4794648	4803672	It is all Nintendo points now, but now, you know, once you put those Nintendo points in, like, you know, one place and you can't really do anything with them.
4803732	4804612	Yeah, you can't name.
4804772	4808134	Because you have two different accounts because, once again, there's no unified online service.
4808954	4809214	Grr.
4811110	4819132	I'm surprised they don't have, you know, like, a friend code for the points or something like that that you gotta put in, you know, make sure that you can buy that game or something.
4819172	4822193	Or that you have to write with your stylus, all praise Nintendo.
4822873	4824033	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
4824053	4826634	I agree, I do wish to purchase said game.
4828354	4828674	Blue?
4828694	4834876	In fact, the DSi will actually have a place that will prick your finger for blood every time you actually want to get points.
4835016	4836336	Yeah, that's how you pay for the games.
4836860	4837520	With your blood.
4837561	4838581	With your soul.
4840563	4844425	It's like, do you wish to purchase this game and relinquish your soul?
4845066	4845326	What?
4846427	4848048	I just sold my soul for a donut.
4850870	4852311	Yes, Red Entertainment, that's perfect.
4852331	4853331	You have to write every time.
4853491	4854632	I am a Nintendo lemming.
4855353	4856373	Bah, bah, bah.
4857114	4857414	Anyhow.
4858695	4861477	You know what segment of ours has to follow a story like this.
4872967	4876788	It's time for the FUs of the week.
4878709	4885552	My FU of the week goes towards... You know what?
4885632	4887072	I don't know that I have one for once.
4887873	4888293	Gasp.
4889313	4891234	FU to your lack of angst?
4891314	4892154	Well, no.
4892294	4894055	It's because I'm a Vicodin.
4895376	4898637	And Vicodin makes you not give a shit about anything.
4898677	4898997	Oh, yeah.
4899277	4899897	Okay, I've got one.
4900718	4901498	Mr. Moron.
4903434	4914545	F you to people, anyone who thinks I'm insulted by anything anyone has to say about me because that's obviously a sign that someone else has the issue and I do not.
4916106	4917348	Don't come in my cubicle!
4918928	4919568	Thank you for watching!
4940775	4959135	and he just started mumbling and just trying to say you know just really stupid insulting things and I got you know what I did I laughed I just laughed I laughed so hard right there I was like dude you know how stupid you sound and so he left and didn't bother me the rest of the day
4959861	4961162	And that's just what I'm going to do from now on.
4961202	4967248	If anyone ever tries to just, you know, be mean, I'm just going to laugh.
4967468	4967849	That's all.
4968709	4970711	My response from now on is going to be, uh-huh.
4971232	4971672	I love this.
4971712	4973954	The Rob D in chat says, I've seen her cubicle.
4974295	4979039	Much like you would expect from DarkSakura, it's filled with pink fluffy clouds and is generally welcoming.
4979500	4980440	The hell it is!
4982614	5000667	Yeah, I killed him with laughter, because I mean, basically, okay, keep in mind, I've had this problem before, and the whole reason that I think that people try to be insulting, especially when they're in the wrong, is to make themselves feel less wrong, to put themselves in a position of superiority.
5001487	5007872	And this person has absolutely zero room, and I can say that in a completely unbiased fashion.
5008472	5010954	Yes, I do have the giant Tekken poster in my cubicle, thank you.
5011494	5012135	That's what you'd say?
5012737	5014118	No, I was answering that comment.
5015058	5017319	I just laughed.
5017979	5018660	I just laughed.
5018680	5028604	It's like, how can someone say that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about when this is the same person that asks me how to copy cells in Excel?
5030114	5030714	Don't ask!
5030875	5031755	Control-C, Control-V.
5032376	5032756	Exactly!
5033116	5036779	SSJ100Matt says, you need to set up gun turrets at the entrance of your cubicle.
5037139	5042203	Actually, I was looking at ThinkGeek just a moment ago, and they do have USB missile launchers.
5042443	5043284	Those are overrated.
5043544	5045005	Trust me, I have one at my desk.
5045085	5045866	It's just retarded.
5046626	5047647	It sits there for seconds, all like...
5049361	5051041	I could build a better rocket launcher.
5051061	5053702	My cubicle drains the souls of other people and then gives them to me.
5053722	5054242	Alright, Loki.
5077392	5083135	F you to myself for buying a magazine for my gun that's a double mag.
5083155	5092799	The problem is because it's basically two magazines that are stuck next to each other when I plug it in, the other magazine covers the switch that allows me to pop the magazine out.
5093199	5098021	So it makes it near impossible to take out the magazine once I put it in.
5099401	5099701	Dope!
5100782	5101862	Should have paid attention.
5101882	5103523	I still love it though.
5105922	5107903	Alright, that it?
5108224	5111185	Also an FU to my Triton headphones I've got.
5111846	5117149	Already the left side, basically if you jiggle the cord a little bit, it will go out.
5117509	5119771	So that pisses me off because they were expensive.
5121078	5121158	F.U.
5121178	5127484	to the pig fucker who stole the political sign from my front yard earlier this week, not even 24 hours after I placed it up.
5127585	5131809	As you know, we have a very controversial proposition in the ballot here in California.
5132590	5138896	They want to ban same-sex marriage and take rights away from people and treat certain people of this country differently than others, or of the state, I should say.
5138916	5139897	This is a state proposition.
5140437	5141397	And it's called Proposition 8.
5141537	5144078	They're using scare tactics to do it, which aren't even true.
5144638	5146339	They are not going to tax churches.
5146959	5149560	They're not going to force churches to marry people they don't want to marry.
5149740	5151440	Do atheists get married in church right now?
5151800	5153401	Do they force churches to marry people?
5153801	5156042	Can a non-Catholic get married in mass?
5156262	5156622	Uh-huh.
5156882	5157262	Exactly.
5157402	5166505	They don't... I mean, when we were getting married and trying to have a Jewish wedding, you know, the female... What was it?
5166545	5167185	The female...
5168669	5170911	Not priest, what's the word I'm looking for here?
5171012	5171352	Rabbi.
5171612	5171873	Rabbi.
5172053	5173274	Yes, a female rabbi.
5173354	5178339	She's like, no, I don't want to marry a non-Jew and a Jew together.
5178359	5180101	I'm like, you're a fucking female rabbi.
5180141	5182264	There's not supposed to be female rabbis, idiot.
5182604	5183925	Fucking contradictive.
5184006	5185027	Look, look, I don't...
5185567	5186608	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5206007	5209468	That our grandparents fought for, but I guess history repeats itself, so what the fuck ever.
5209848	5216771	But anyhow, obviously, for obvious reasons, a very staunch supporter of the No on 8 campaign.
5217251	5221832	So I had a No on 8 sign in the front yard of my house, and it got stolen within 24 hours.
5221912	5226394	Because that's just the kind of idiocy that's behind the support of this proposition.
5226674	5230595	Absolute moronism behind Proposition 8.
5231676	5235417	That would steal a yard sign from the front of my house to make a goddamn point.
5236670	5238351	The point you made was that you're an idiot.
5238391	5238872	End of story.
5239292	5239833	So guess what?
5239893	5242615	I had a second sign waiting in the house and I promptly put it up in its place.
5243140	5246301	You should electrify it, Rob.
5246401	5248822	The good idea was to rub it down to something sticky.
5249242	5254603	By the way, Sauce pointed out to me, for me to inform Loki, is that female rabbis are allowed in Reformed Judaism.
5254923	5261945	Right, it depends what branch of the... They're allowed, I understand that, but the problem is, like, originally they're not... That's why it's Reformed.
5262566	5262986	Exactly.
5264286	5269868	But it's okay to also marry, you know, out of the religion, but it's just... They're just being stupid.
5269888	5270628	It's like, oh...
5271636	5273576	So this is okay, but it's not okay.
5274017	5288860	What pisses me off, and I have to add to Rob's FU, is just, um, like, uh, the, uh, I haven't seen the commercials, but I've heard of them, and I've been told of the concepts, and I don't watch TV, of, you know, them saying all that bullshit.
5288920	5293681	It's like, they're trying to appeal to the stupid, pretty much, to the uninformed, to the ignorant.
5293921	5297262	They're trying to scare people that we're gonna have to teach it in schools.
5298820	5300301	DarkSakura.com
5317566	5318607	Thank you for watching!
5345625	5348827	Your email address is... I don't care.
5348887	5349347	I'll do it.
5349527	5350167	It just bugs me.
5350508	5350728	Yep.
5351148	5351428	Sorry.
5352368	5352909	This is war.
5353809	5355610	But, you know, this is what I have to say, actually, Rob.
5355630	5356210	Yeah, go ahead.
5356370	5359632	Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even though they're wrong.
5359692	5360372	But not on this.
5360512	5361113	I'm sorry.
5361633	5363934	No, we have to be fair.
5364334	5365015	This is America.
5367596	5371978	I understand, but at the same time, your rights stop where mine begin.
5372637	5373077	I agree.
5374278	5378062	Now, this was my second point, is that yes, you're allowed to disagree.
5378162	5379403	You're allowed to have your belief.
5379723	5388750	That is what this country was founded on, not God or religion, because Thomas Jefferson certainly didn't follow that, and he wrote our Declaration of Independence.
5388810	5389211	Fair enough.
5390272	5397917	My point is that everyone should be allowed to believe and feel what they want to believe and feel.
5398697	5403641	They just have to also be equally tolerant of anyone who believes other than what they do.
5403701	5405662	Like I tell everybody, be offended.
5405862	5406643	Learn to be offended.
5407043	5408964	I'm having a hard time, Jamie.
5409845	5414208	See, this is the problem is that we're dealing with people who aren't leaving it at that.
5415430	5423140	We're dealing with people who are trying to force their point of view on other people and have the majority view right now.
5425257	5427718	Alright, we're getting too much on the political topic.
5430339	5436121	I firmly believe that we should be a more tolerant people.
5436521	5442303	Obviously it's a very sensitive issue that I have a very strong and invested opinion in for obvious reasons.
5442543	5446785	So if I'm a little bit unhinged, I apologize to a point.
5446985	5453527	But certainly you need to understand that when you are voting yes on this, you are saying my rights are not...
5454227	5457410	Okay, and that's why I get so fucking incensed.
5461193	5461753	There we go.
5462414	5462634	Sorry.
5464636	5466257	Anyhow, let's get back to the gaming news, shall we?
5466437	5469760	Yay, video games to make everything better and make us forget about what a fucked up world we live in.
5469840	5470501	Right, Loki?
5470981	5471562	Yes.
5472262	5472643	In fact...
5473493	5474654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5493124	5500831	Basically, instead of a brand new game, they're going to have a compilation of all the Nintendo 64 and GameCube titles on one disc.
5501372	5504074	Might be like one of those Play on the Wii things.
5505756	5505936	Hmm.
5506436	5507097	They were not bad.
5507257	5508278	Those games are pretty good.
5508678	5510060	So, that'd be kind of cool.
5510885	5515026	But where is my lightsaber-wielding game?
5515666	5518647	Force Unleashed, the Clone Wars lightsaber duels.
5518667	5520708	No, no, I mean like with the Wiimote and that whole thing.
5520728	5522008	I guess there was the lightsaber duels thing.
5522028	5523548	Wii Sports Resort.
5524229	5524869	Oh, yes, I forgot.
5524909	5525649	Wii Sports Resort.
5525729	5525989	Okay.
5526069	5526789	Let me put it this way.
5528050	5530990	I wouldn't want to see one until the Wii Motion Plus came out anyways.
5531431	5535812	And even one that came out, I mean, they could port the arcade game.
5535832	5536772	Remember the arcade game?
5538796	5539758	I love the arcade game.
5539798	5540479	That was fun.
5541480	5546288	Yeah, so GS68 said just like almost at the exact same time in chat, Star Wars Trilogy Arcade Games bonus rounds.
5547202	5547542	There you go.
5571658	5573621	Video games have really taken over on YouTube.
5573661	5579389	I mean, heck, all these classic games of the week that DarkSakura's reporting on, you can search for any of them on YouTube and look at clips of the game.
5579770	5584436	And there's new game reviews and there's tons and tons of video game content out on YouTube.
5584757	5587580	Well now, what YouTube has decided they want to do
5587961	5588301	DarkSakura.com
5606014	5610258	It's going to start with some of the music based on EMI Music and Universal.
5610479	5613121	Now it's also going to be video games made by EA.
5613602	5619007	So apparently when you go, let's say you visit a YouTube of a game made from EA, you'll be able to buy the game right there.
5620168	5620709	So there you go.
5621209	5621750	It's kind of neat.
5622010	5623671	And then YouTube will get a cut of the game sales.
5624152	5626214	So YouTube will sell you games.
5626594	5626975	There you go.
5628677	5629397	That's a good tie-in.
5629437	5630478	I mean, kind of a duh.
5630538	5632538	Kind of surprised it didn't really happen before.
5633438	5636119	But I'm curious, you know, what about the retro games?
5636439	5637740	Those are a little harder to find.
5638380	5639580	Maybe eBay links or something.
5639620	5639940	Who knows?
5640801	5642241	Or links to used game stores.
5643361	5643682	I guess.
5645822	5646362	There you have it.
5647743	5648183	YouTube.
5649663	5653224	I wonder if soon you'll be able to buy DVDs of TV shows that you see on YouTube.
5653244	5656885	Or like, you know, like... CD for Chocolate Rain.
5657006	5657626	I hardly ever...
5659025	5659525	DarkSakura.com
5686454	5686794	I don't know.
5686894	5690155	I knew you'd be on Vicodin tonight, so you just want to be happy, happy.
5690435	5693716	You'd rather give me... Because you know if I don't care about something, I'll say I don't care about it.
5693856	5695917	This is very, very, very happy news.
5696737	5702659	For Street Fighter 4 home releases, there's been another female character confirmed.
5702699	5703899	And it's Sakura!
5704180	5704820	I'm very happy!
5705940	5729311	and I watched video of it actually today Rob and she's there in her full kick-ass glory so I'm quite thrilled with that but she was confirmed actually to Famitsu by Yoshinori Ono that she was going to definitely be in the home version and there's also going to be a few more things in the home version including a training mode
5730703	5731023	DarkSakura.com
5746109	5750312	Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter I actually adopted her as my online avatar for a while.
5751893	5752753	Oh, I remember that.
5753574	5759177	Way back in the day on the Sacramento's DDR forum, your little avatar was DarkSakura, the actual one.
5759778	5771665	I had taken the picture from the ending of Rival Schools and did the sunburnt look to her and made her sailor dress black and make her red eyes.
5772746	5774687	Early photoshopping before I had photoshopped.
5774867	5776747	Well, I think we're all going to be playing Street Fighter 4.
5776787	5778548	I'm excited about that game.
5778568	5779568	I wish it was out by Christmas.
5779748	5781388	I wish it was out by right now.
5781888	5786909	I also kind of don't because I need my games to be spaced out right about now because I'm still trying to work on Silent Hill Homecoming.
5787309	5790950	And then I've got World of Warcraft going on, which, by the way, I deemed 50 on my alt.
5791430	5791950	Thank you very much.
5792190	5799151	I will have you know, though, that Street Fighter 4 is supposed to be coming out around the time as the brand new Street Fighter movie.
5799672	5800032	Awesome.
5800072	5802252	That'll give you a nice fresh taste in your mouth.
5804176	5805257	Ah, anyways.
5805997	5806818	Guitar Hero.
5807498	5810260	World Tour is right around the corner, only a few weeks away.
5811080	5815683	And with that is going to be some brand new download content available for the game.
5816964	5828930	They're going to have a classic rock track pack filled with a bunch of different things, including Rock and Roll Band by Boston, Hot Blooded by Foreigner, and Jessie's Girl by Rick Springfield.
5829211	5829711	Awesome!
5831668	5834931	and then also they're going to have a few more tracks.
5835972	5837674	Blind Melons, No Rain.
5837694	5839536	Oh dear god, I hate that song.
5840076	5840236	What?
5840296	5841197	I love that song.
5841257	5844661	Which is in Rock Band 2 right now.
5844741	5848264	No wait, Blind Melons isn't in Rock Band 2, are they?
5848925	5849025	R.E.M.
5849045	5850547	Horse to Water, Man Size Wreath, Supernatural, Super Serious
5874767	5876908	Supernatural, Super Serious?
5877569	5879150	God, they never put in the one R.E.M.
5879190	5880330	song I'd like to have in there.
5882331	5883032	Which is?
5883332	5884192	Don't Fall On Me.
5885233	5885973	What album's that on?
5886694	5888215	It was on Document, I think.
5890176	5896659	I'm disappointed to see that they don't have some of the Phil Collins stuff in there.
5896679	5900802	The ones where it's Hold On, I guess?
5901122	5902743	We need Land of Confusion.
5903701	5907482	I am just very excited to get to play Rick Springfield in Guitar Hero.
5907522	5909803	That is going to be all kinds of awesome.
5909883	5913343	Guitar Hero World Tour, although I don't think I'm going to have the whole setup in my house.
5913764	5915864	I'll play along with the charade.
5917424	5920505	There doesn't seem to be a reason to change.
5920725	5920905	Yes.
5920925	5923706	You know I feel so dirty when they start.
5924826	5927487	May see if I get in the game only version, but I know I'm not buying another set.
5927507	5929547	I'll probably get the... Well, I want the guitar.
5929567	5930908	I want the new guitar and I want the game.
5931508	5931828	That's it.
5932995	5933355	Don't go away mad
5953917	5957059	That's my favorite Motley Crue song That was a freaking great album
5975700	5980522	Anyway, Slice of Your Pie, Rattlesnake Shay, Kickstart My Heart.
5981083	5982744	Lots and lots and lots of good songs coming out.
5982864	5985385	No other random songs announced yet.
5985445	5988467	Those are the only ones they've announced so far.
5988527	5994189	Sometimes there's been little random offerings from other bands that show up as well with the albums.
5995510	5997011	Did Stephen Colbert have any other songs?
5997291	5998972	We need Singing in Korean on there.
6000700	6004963	I want to see more South Park songs or more DVDA stuff.
6005263	6006104	You know what?
6006124	6008045	They should be doing... They might be Giants.
6009426	6010867	And more Jonathan Colton.
6011487	6011808	We'll see.
6011868	6014369	I love Skull Crusher Mountain, but I could totally use Ikea.
6014509	6016210	Like, we need America, fuck yeah.
6016951	6018392	Or the montage song.
6018412	6020093	Gonna need a montage.
6020313	6025597	Alright, look, let's get into the Journey to the Wonderland song, because this song's awesome and it always means...
6026357	6027339	That's mailbag time.
6027859	6029522	Every week you send us mail at email.
6029922	6032026	I'm sorry, at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
6032867	6035350	DarkSakura goes in the mailbag and reads her favorite emails.
6035691	6040118	Unfortunately, since there was no show ended up getting posted on the feed last week, I believe we have slim pickings tonight.
6041004	6043005	All right, well, let's read them.
6043085	6043766	Let's hear them.
6044526	6048189	This one comes from Robert M. That would be freaking rad.
6067586	6068767	Has he launched yet?
6068847	6071107	I knew he was a private citizen that was going to be going.
6071328	6077250	He's one of the famous... He bought the Russian space tourist thing and I'd heard about that, but I didn't know if he'd actually gone yet.
6077270	6078390	See, I was thinking of Gradius.
6078670	6080271	It's supposed to happen this year at some point.
6080291	6081872	I was thinking of Gradius and Salamander.
6083352	6084653	I don't think it's quite like that.
6085133	6087033	If he's got a little ship, that would be great.
6089054	6092336	An ultimate game in space.
6092856	6096017	But really, this is basically civilian in space, right?
6098038	6100840	Yes, except the civilian in question happens to be a famous game designer.
6101661	6101961	Do it.
6102682	6103242	Seriously.
6103923	6117234	I actually think that it would be a very good thing, I think, to have more civilians, you know, to be able to have that go through, because that just puts us that much closer to colonizing the moon.
6118976	6121277	and then Space Monkeys.
6122418	6128922	I'm sorry, I was looking at the little iPhone game that John has.
6129622	6130463	The Space Monkey game.
6130803	6131003	Nice.
6131863	6132704	We need Space Monkeys.
6134815	6136516	Next one, shall we?
6136536	6137297	Sure, next email.
6137317	6138518	This one comes from Rob with two Bs.
6139579	6142101	I don't know if this is an old story, but I found it on Dig.
6142521	6146304	Most of the myths debunked are the media effects on children.
6146445	6153010	There's one myth I have personal debunking knowledge, and that's whether, because gamers are used to train soldiers to kill.
6153490	6157393	No, games are being used to train soldiers to kill, and they have the same impact on kids who play them.
6158254	6187602	I used to work in trainers and simulators for the army and they're not even close to the games we play even when they use the same basic software it's modded for realism and specific training goals and he says he has the same shirt in the stock photo in the article I'm pulling up the article because I'd actually like to go over it if you don't mind the availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence and it actually says that we're at a 30 year low like I had brought that up before a while back right
6190563	6211019	Scientific evidence links violent gameplay to youth aggression Claims like this are the work of researchers who represent one relatively narrow school of research media effects The research includes some 300 studies of media violence, but most of these studies are inconclusive and many have been criticized on methodical grounds
6213094	6215615	I'm sorry, methodological grounds.
6216296	6218037	Children are the primary market for video games.
6218977	6223781	And actually the center of the video game market is actually older teen to adult.
6225041	6226562	Almost no girls play computer games.
6226783	6227223	Bullshit!
6229295	6243002	and 5 was the one that Rob said in his email because it's to train soldiers to kill and that's no dude even anyone should know that 6 video games are not a meaningful form of expression
6244540	6246041	I love this one and it was also on my birthday.
6246681	6248583	On April 19, 2002, U.S.
6249083	6250964	District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr.
6251265	6256268	ruled that video games do not convey ideas and thus enjoy no constitutional protection.
6256968	6257709	As evidenced, St.
6257749	6268116	Louis County presented the judge with videotaped excerpts from four games, all within a narrow range of genre, and all the subject of previous controversy, overturning a similar decision in Indianapolis.
6268476	6278107	Federal Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner noted, "...violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive, theme of both culture high and low.
6278527	6285755	It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm, Anderson, and Perrault are aware."
6286716	6296570	To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be chaotic, but deforming.
6296970	6300195	It would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.
6301917	6306221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6329260	6333301	Never allowed to read anything but what her mother let her read, that type of thing.
6334101	6338243	And she's very, very ill-prepared for her life now.
6338743	6341724	I mean, to the point of about to lose her children.
6342544	6349626	And if kids don't know how to deal with a zombie infestation now, what's going to happen when it really does happen?
6349706	6350186	Seriously.
6351428	6353549	Video gameplay is socially isolating.
6356670	6358050	Much video gameplay is social.
6358070	6359951	Almost 60% of frequent gamers play with friends.
6362171	6365452	33% play with siblings and 25% play with spouses or parents.
6366873	6369973	Video gameplay is desensitizing.
6370614	6371754	No, it's not.
6376490	6379154	Rob D has a very funny comment in chat there.
6379174	6380877	It says, video game play is isolating.
6381197	6386405	That's why I'm in a chat room with 40 other people and I've met a lot of them talking about the various conventions and stuff.
6386786	6387287	Exactly.
6387787	6387968	Funny.
6400914	6402415	What's up, OLR hosts?
6402595	6412524	Back at PAX, amongst the random conversation in between bites of delicious food at Wild Ginger, I mentioned that while I have friends that are into video games, I have no friends that are willing to make a podcast with me.
6413004	6413785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6435340	6437562	Did you imagine you'd still be doing it after all of this time?
6437582	6437642	No.
6437662	6437742	Yes.
6437762	6438202	I thought we would.
6455658	6457299	After this long... I'm stubborn.
6457419	6467621	Since Under Station Live ended, for me, I mean, obviously it's still going, but since it ended for me because of Travis's move, no, I didn't think this show would outlast Under Station Live.
6467761	6468322	I really didn't.
6468462	6470402	But we've all... You're right.
6470422	6472643	We've all been kind of stubborn and haven't gone anywhere.
6473043	6479785	We're still here in SAC, and although our lives have all gone through significant changes, certainly nobody's really left or... You know what I mean?
6480393	6485657	So I felt that I would keep, I would at least keep broadcasting in some way or another.
6487239	6490041	Honestly, I think that's part of the reason why Orange Lounge Radio was started in the first place.
6490081	6492923	So no, none of us had to be talked into it because you hit the nail on the head.
6492963	6494604	We all kind of were doing it anyway.
6495585	6498207	So it was kind of like a chance for us to kind of talk about something.
6498628	6507075	You know, I don't want to say that we wanted to talk about because we certainly had that outlet on Understation Live, but maybe something different that we felt we had a lot more to say, if that makes sense.
6507735	6508796	I think it's kind of where this started.
6509585	6512547	Well, to continue, if I may.
6513147	6513307	Sure.
6513327	6514728	I was going to say, you may.
6515388	6515629	Sorry.
6516509	6517370	I've been listening to Rocky.
6517430	6519351	You may.
6520151	6523433	When did you know it was something that you wanted to continue doing?
6525834	6529016	I think it was just sort of, we just sort of kept doing it.
6529336	6531678	I mean, it's not a conscious decision.
6531718	6533159	Are we going to keep doing OLR?
6533179	6538642	I think the moment that we had 12 listeners the first night and we were like, cool, somebody is actually listening to this.
6539707	6541649	I think we've grown since the 12 listeners.
6541929	6544091	A little bit, thanks to podcasting.
6544551	6548935	Finally, were there any people you asked to host OLR that didn't want to do it?
6549055	6554160	In other words, are there any lost OLR hosts or hosts that could have been?
6555106	6555707	Rob and I had a meeting.
6555747	6557048	Should we just make Loki a host?
6557088	6557288	Sure.
6577364	6578064	and Lo and Behold.
6578705	6583266	No, the idea, the concept kind of formed between Jamie and I and that's where it is.
6583966	6585487	There was no really other host considered.
6586567	6591329	Guests, people, I think you've pretty much heard everybody we've wanted to have on the show.
6594190	6595471	I want Igarashi.
6595571	6598772	Well, I mean, you know what I mean, like local wise and local other DDR peeps.
6599912	6601293	We need to get Dan back on the show.
6601873	6602053	Yeah.
6602593	6604254	Okay, next paragraph.
6605920	6607281	By the way, I just want to say it real quick.
6607721	6608621	We also got another email in.
6608661	6617944	VXChaseXV in chats, who's obviously been following us a long, long time, says the podcast specifically, podcasting into the main show, I think that was when it really hit the ground running.
6618284	6622725	OLR moved on from just Bomani to video games that don't suck and podcasting.
6622745	6623766	That was the real time.
6624206	6629048	I admit, even the show does seem to have a different feel to it now, but it's a natural evolution.
6629348	6630888	We got older.
6631168	6633069	We actually have a bit more structure.
6633329	6633489	Mm-hmm.
6633869	6634870	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6654115	6654636	Next paragraph.
6655836	6658657	Also, what did you think about the Mega Man 9 downloadable content?
6675723	6680609	I know gaming is a business and I appreciate that Capcom is in tune with the fans to put Proto Man in the game.
6681350	6683672	I wish it didn't have to come at my expense.
6684693	6686876	Thanks, Rob D. P.S.
6687376	6690139	Looks like I'll have to buy OE for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
6690219	6691341	Sad, I can't pass it up.
6692713	6699799	Rob hit the nail on the head that this is kind of where we're seeing the industry going is that now we're having to pay for things we used to just unlock for fun, which is sad.
6700559	6703582	But I can't give an opinion on the Mega Man 9 download content because I haven't got it.
6703802	6704662	There's still unlockables.
6704763	6706344	There are, but you know what I mean?
6706424	6707605	Try the Proto Man thing.
6707705	6708105	It's fun.
6709286	6709486	I do.
6709526	6710187	I want to check it out.
6710767	6712288	Or as he was originally called, Blues.
6713189	6714910	Aw, Rob's apologizing for the long email.
6714930	6715731	Don't apologize.
6715751	6716311	It was actually fun.
6716411	6718513	It was a little bit of retro.
6718573	6719714	It gave us time to get another email.
6720245	6728450	Hello all, a month after the Nintendo DS Game Dragon Quest 4 chapters of The Chosen was released, I finally had the chance to finish playing through the game and give it a somewhat in-depth review.
6739897	6751305	I wound up playing the original Dragon Quest 4 and then chapters of The Chosen back to back in order to compare the remake to the original so I would better appreciate what the remake has to offer.
6752045	6755828	Overall, the game is as close to perfect as a classic RPG can be.
6756208	6763073	It's definitely worth checking out for those who have played the original Dragon Quest 4 and those who have never played the game before alike.
6763673	6769097	As always, the full review can be found on my blog at AvengersTower.com or through my Twitter, Mar and Marvel.
6769797	6771017	Keep up the great job, OLR.
6771057	6774519	I look forward to coming out to Sacramento soon to see you all again.
6775439	6776179	And that's from Mari.
6776259	6776999	Yay!
6777039	6778120	Whatever happened to her moving here?
6778460	6779880	And I'm going to copy the link in the chat box.
6779900	6781201	Is that still something that might happen?
6781981	6782521	I hope.
6782961	6783501	I wish.
6783781	6784402	I hope so, too.
6784942	6785642	It must happen.
6786445	6788326	Diablo III, Wizard, and
6811009	6814315	Please tell me the game will say Blue Wizard is about to die.
6815116	6815817	Wrong game.
6816558	6817099	Aw, damn it.
6817159	6818181	But the wizard is blue.
6819143	6820986	Actually, the wizard was yellow and gauntlet, but never mind.
6822693	6824074	The wizard is blue in this one.
6824174	6825395	Okay, well, cool.
6826495	6838681	Anyways, and then they didn't really say exactly too much about it other than the wizard can hurl lightning, can channel explosive arcane energies.
6838821	6840002	It's a fucking wizard.
6840062	6841222	What else do you need to know?
6841302	6842323	I mean, seriously.
6842543	6843503	It's a fucking wizard.
6844003	6846945	I mean, is it suddenly going to have a sword and shield?
6847485	6848225	No, it's a wizard.
6848446	6848826	Magic.
6848846	6848946	Magic.
6849634	6852697	and Red Wizard that have a shortened shield there.
6853417	6853797	Shut up.
6855959	6856760	Yeah, that's it.
6857220	6857681	There you go.
6858181	6859702	Well, also some other news about Diablo 3.
6859943	6863265	You know, people have been begging Blizzard to put World of Warcraft on consoles.
6863706	6872213	And what's interesting about Diablo 3 and some of the news that's come out about Diablo 3 is that possibly it could be coming to consoles.
6872413	6876216	I guess this was based off a very veiled comment that came out of BlizzCon, but you know what?
6877519	6878100	Thank you for watching!
6895208	6897409	By the way, some other little tidbits out of BlizzCon.
6898050	6902092	You'll soon be able to use your mounts in the water in a future World of Warcraft patch.
6902132	6906514	Right now, if you try to run across a river on your mount, you will automatically dismount.
6906774	6909936	But now your mounts will apparently work in the water, so you can try to drown your horse.
6909976	6910496	Isn't that nice?
6911397	6912578	There you have it.
6913018	6920102	By the way, to hear some other things about BlizzCon, we're actually going to get an old OLR buddy here on the phone who is actually at BlizzCon.
6920562	6923904	We want to talk to them about their experience at BlizzCon, so we're giving a call right now.
6925643	6926263	One ringy dingy.
6929525	6930446	Two ringy dingys.
6931766	6932847	Hopefully he answers the phone.
6932867	6933327	Hola.
6933627	6935208	Hello, is this Xtofer?
6936929	6937129	Si.
6937549	6939030	Hola, Xtofer.
6939090	6940211	Como estas?
6942292	6943912	Esta bien, y tu?
6945133	6946314	Muy mal.
6947874	6948335	Why?
6948435	6948975	Por que?
6948995	6951876	Because I didn't go to BlizzCon like you, you asshole.
6951896	6953958	Oh, I'm sorry.
6954098	6954698	Well, you know.
6955649	6959991	I don't know what to do for that, but I did, so whatever.
6960291	6961491	Alright, well how was BlizzCon?
6961511	6962312	Tell us about the trip.
6962352	6963072	What did you do?
6963212	6963732	How was it?
6964052	6966213	Walk us through your experience at BlizzCon.
6967694	6970255	Well, it was pretty cool.
6970695	6981700	We got there a day before it started and we picked up our bags and it was kind of confusing how to pick up our goodie bags.
6981920	6984561	Once we did, we got back to our hotels, kind of looked at it all.
6985718	6990799	and there was a lot of stuff that was in there that they didn't list on the website actually.
6990839	7001201	They gave us a bunch of, everybody got a free authenticator that was BlizzCon themed so it has like a BlizzCon logo on it and everything.
7001721	7003282	Wait, you got a free authenticator?
7003862	7004482	You fucker.
7005882	7007043	Yeah, we all got that.
7007083	7008603	I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry.
7009963	7010763	What was that?
7010803	7013164	I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry, go ahead.
7014231	7014812	Oh, okay.
7014912	7016393	I hate you too.
7017293	7025278	So, yeah, and then we got there in the morning the next day and pretty much watched the panels.
7025338	7030622	We waited in line at the BlizzCon store for three hours before we got to the front of it.
7031162	7032283	Oh, my God.
7032723	7034504	What was so important that you had to get?
7036025	7040208	Well, I wanted a shirt, and Annie, my sister, wanted...
7041440	7046422	also a shirt, and one of their little messenger bags that they have.
7046862	7050844	And so, yeah, we waited really long for that.
7050964	7060667	And then Jim, my brother-in-law, got my sister a murloc, which was the big collectible thing this year, I guess.
7062008	7063948	And so it was pretty fun.
7063988	7067150	There was a lot of panels, a lot of exciting...
7068888	7075930	I like that comment from Redertainment in chat right now He says, I waited three hours and all I got was this fucking shirt
7092297	7093337	I know, that's what I said.
7093357	7096999	Um, I think that, uh, just, I don't know, like, it's very general, because a lot of things got big responses, um,
7119945	7125146	When I was at the panels in particular, I was at the Dungeons and Raids panel.
7125766	7128227	I was at half of the PvP panel.
7129067	7135968	And I think that class balance is really a big issue on a lot of people's minds.
7136008	7141369	How are they going to balance the classes, especially with the Death Knights being the big new class?
7141849	7145030	And they kind of really validated their...
7145660	7149844	Everybody's Concerns, which I think made everyone happy.
7150145	7160235	I think everything that they said, every answer that they gave that had to do with class balances was particularly good to hear for a lot of people.
7160922	7169227	I don't know if we mentioned it on this show yet tonight, but I think we were talking about it a little bit with Bobby when we were doing the tease on the Bobby Blackwolf show before us here on All Games Radio.
7169508	7177933	We were mentioning that some guy had a Diablo 3 shirt that actually worked for Blizzard that had like unicorns and rainbows on it, and it was a Diablo 3 shirt.
7178373	7179934	Did you see that shirt?
7180515	7184738	I didn't see the shirt, but there was a funny thing that happened.
7186089	7191654	During the closing ceremony, they actually showed that on the big screen.
7192275	7197840	They were making fun of Diablo 3, and then they showed it, and everybody just lost it.
7197880	7199861	It was crazy, but yeah, it was fun.
7200282	7202764	Speaking of Diablo 3... By the way... Go ahead.
7204205	7204546	Go ahead.
7205246	7210631	Oh, I was going to say, Patton Oswalt was incredibly funny.
7210751	7212653	He is great to see in person.
7213427	7216369	Did you get your hands on any of the games that were on the floor?
7216389	7217650	Because he had Diablo 3, Starcraft 2.
7217710	7219331	What did you play?
7242028	7255181	Well, last year I played StarCraft II, and I'm not a big, like, real-time strategy, like, type of person, so I thought it was fine for what it was, but I did get a chance this year to play Diablo III, and I was sold.
7255821	7257383	Like, it's definitely really fun.
7257423	7262768	I've never played Diablo in my life before that, and it was absolutely wonderful.
7263188	7265531	I definitely recommend it when it comes out.
7265711	7266311	It's not even...
7267512	7271515	Anywhere near finished yet, which makes it even more incredible to me.
7271735	7272736	What was the demo like?
7273016	7274077	What did you get to do in the demo?
7275838	7280202	Well, you could choose your class, which there's only three playable classes right now.
7280222	7283744	And after that, you go into this dungeon-y area.
7284485	7290790	And basically, my sister and my brother-in-law, all three of us grouped up into a party.
7291290	7296274	And we all three just had fun, just kind of mashing the buttons and seeing what
7296758	7300221	Abilities we could, you know, use or whatever.
7301301	7305945	None of us had played the game before, so we didn't really know how to control it.
7306025	7308046	So we were kind of noobs learning for the first time.
7308527	7313891	But it was actually surprisingly easy, and there's a lot of different, like, creepy little enemies.
7314991	7319395	And, I don't know, they're all, like, skeletal, and there's a lot of blood in it.
7319535	7323438	And, I don't know, it's like a dungeon-y type place.
7323458	7325159	Okay.
7325729	7327650	Awesome.
7327750	7330510	What would you say was the best thing about BlizzCon?
7333051	7338173	The best thing this year about BlizzCon was the contest ceremony.
7339053	7341174	Jay Moore absolutely killed it.
7341294	7347736	And I don't care if you don't like Jay Moore, I think he was hilarious and he actually created a lot of new fans that night.
7348616	7352377	And the actual dance contest was
7353149	7357273	Redertainment is asking, did someone ask Jay Moore if his show was cancelled?
7383660	7391783	You know, nobody got to ask Jay Moore anything, but I'm sure he'll have a canceled show within the next few weeks or so.
7392703	7398345	DJ Dark Knight wants to know, did you go to any of the tournaments that were going on?
7400146	7404187	We wanted to, but there was so much going on that we actually didn't.
7404587	7412650	I kind of kept up to date on what was going on with the arena tournaments by looking on Wow Insider, like with my phone.
7413834	7421276	Which was kind of cool because I guess there was a huge upset this year, but as far as I know, the area looked really cool.
7421296	7422736	We got to walk by a few times.
7424236	7425197	Nice.
7425357	7428197	Shaoran, speaking of your phone, actually wants to know, how's your iPhone?
7430558	7433078	It freaking rocks, I guess.
7433518	7433938	I don't know.
7433998	7434619	It's okay.
7434699	7436339	I'm kind of over the iPhone, actually.
7436379	7441180	I keep on telling people that I might actually switch to a different phone in November.
7441926	7445870	DarkTetsuya wants to know if The Wizard was playable in Diablo 3.
7467794	7471235	It was, and I actually played The Wizard, and it was really fun.
7471916	7473917	I was very impressed.
7474897	7480319	Once again, having not ever played the game before, I was thoroughly impressed by it.
7480679	7484161	At least for anybody that hasn't played the game before, I definitely recommend it.
7484541	7492104	And from what I hear, most fans of Diablo are definitely going to want to play this.
7492520	7502683	Alright, really quickly, then we're going to let you go because this phone call is going on 10 minutes, but I want to know, did you meet other, because it's a convention, it's a meet and meet people, did you meet any other funny people?
7502964	7506725	Were there some really weird ass people that you actually got to meet?
7508245	7514968	Well, there were weird ass people, but to tell you the truth, Rob, I don't want to meet any of those weird fuckers.
7518149	7522070	Wasn't there somebody you were looking at from a distance going, that guy is fucking weird?
7523556	7526597	Yeah, especially the people that ask questions on the panels.
7527297	7527838	They're the best.
7527878	7531519	They're like, I'm a nerd.
7531899	7534920	And I'm like, did he even ask a question?
7535140	7535681	I don't know.
7535861	7537781	Do they speak different languages?
7538402	7538942	What the hell?
7539862	7540142	All right.
7540602	7543624	Well, hey, Extifer, we've got to let you go so we can get back to our show.
7543664	7545144	But thanks for the report on BlizzCon.
7545184	7546285	And maybe next year I can go.
7547965	7548485	Maybe.
7548525	7548885	Who knows?
7548905	7549286	We'll see.
7549566	7549846	All right.
7550206	7552627	Well, take care, Extifer, and come join us in the studio sometime.
7553976	7558339	Alright, I will, definitely Alright, later dude Alright, bye Bye
7583797	7589998	Alright, let's move on and get to some more gaming news and then we'll get to the Skype line so the rest of y'all can call in and we'll start off.
7590118	7591578	DarkSakura, go into a new game.
7593059	7600380	For anyone who is interested in Call of Duty, Call of Duty 5 is going into beta next week for Xbox 360.
7600440	7602480	Well, I should actually say this week.
7603800	7608701	There will be some sources that are giving out beta codes.
7608721	7609461	You just have to find them.
7610221	7613322	I just thought it was worth saying that Activision is starting testing now.
7615049	7615289	Cool.
7615509	7617671	Kind of like last year, they did the same thing with Call of Duty 4.
7617831	7621973	I remember I got into the beta last year.
7622013	7623254	We only played it a few times.
7623534	7626296	I know that Eurogamer is giving out beta codes.
7626616	7628817	So for our friends overseas, you can find it there.
7629858	7630318	Yeah.
7631199	7631379	Hmm.
7632148	7633749	Very cool.
7633949	7635771	Anyways, let's see here.
7636051	7640034	Something back to the music gaming topic here.
7640614	7647339	There's a brand new music game that's going to make some competition for Beatmania and Activision's new DJ hero.
7647719	7651962	That is Scratch, the ultimate DJ being announced.
7652363	7655325	And it's kind of a partnership of...
7657535	7659936	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7687585	7689926	And overall, I mean, it looks pretty cool so far.
7689947	7692528	I mean, we'll have to see more of a song list and that kind of thing.
7692568	7698571	But, you know, maybe set the bar a little bit high for a DJ here whenever that comes out.
7698671	7700332	But this, I don't know, looks pretty cool.
7700572	7702533	Actdeft in chat gives a mandatory comment.
7702573	7703553	Konami will sue!
7704174	7704534	Will they?
7705114	7705815	Yeah, they may.
7705955	7706675	They may sue.
7707215	7707936	And you know what?
7707956	7712258	That's pretty sad because their attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.
7713899	7716080	And SSJ100Matt says, how can they not be sued for this?
7717512	7718313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7732335	7737139	FYI, VXChaseNXV argues with you and says Konami's attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.
7762846	7763727	15 versions in Japan.
7763767	7764928	Their US attempt was great.
7764989	7765929	It's just the wrong locale.
7766430	7767751	I'm talking about the US one.
7767911	7771895	And yeah, it was alright, but what did they really do with it?
7772256	7772636	Nothing.
7773037	7773877	So you know what?
7774538	7783067	If you're not going to do anything with your product that could probably sell very well, much like Guitar Freaks was...
7785330	7788812	Then, you know, you deserve to be left in the dust, I guess.
7789632	7795015	Just like, you know, putting out a guitar game and a drum game years after everyone else has attempted it.
7795795	7797256	Not probably a smart idea.
7799337	7800678	I reluctantly agree.
7800718	7803519	I have no patience for Konami in the music game world anymore.
7803559	7805360	If they're not going to do it, someone else needs to beat them to it.
7806466	7808847	Although I thought Beatmania in the US was fine.
7809167	7810028	It was alright.
7810228	7811108	Let's look at DDR.
7811488	7813309	What exactly has changed in DDR lately?
7814349	7814770	Not much.
7815250	7818731	How have they supported their games with downloadable content?
7819231	7820032	Not very well.
7821229	7830582	I mean, the quest mode in that game, in the universe games have sucked and they don't really listen to their fan base anymore.
7830642	7833386	They just kind of do what they want because they're DDR and people will buy it.
7834347	7835789	Universe 3 looks kind of cool.
7835809	7836911	People will buy it for a while.
7838206	7838526	All right.
7839127	7842630	Speaking of DDR, there is another DDR game coming out.
7842770	7847834	It is Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves, and it's coming for the Wii.
7848575	7849856	And it's what it sounds like.
7849916	7853079	It's going to be 40 new Disney songs that are going to be coming to the Wii.
7853819	7861426	You know, and the standard press release comes out with this that, you know, apparently you can actually get your Mii in a Disney costume, and that's like what you can dance with in the game.
7861966	7862526	DarkSakura.com
7883817	7884497	The Master Tracklist
7911772	7915613	Tiki Room, or I'm sorry, the most awesome Disney song of all time, the Tiki Room.
7919335	7921215	Come on, you could be able to dance to that, right?
7921275	7922476	Can't you see yourself dancing to that?
7924096	7926377	Tell me the Tiki Room isn't the most awesome Disney song of all time.
7927578	7929518	Tiki Room is the best place to go when it's hot.
7930038	7933240	Question, why do I see a song called Ducks in the Hood?
7935020	7935420	Don't ask.
7935440	7939842	I mean, Ducks in the Hood, really?
7942466	7943526	I have to actually make a comment about that.
7943566	7944627	It better have freaking dance magic in it.
7971585	7972086	I haven't heard.
7972666	7973206	We'll see.
7973787	7974347	This is one.
7974547	7978991	Rob did have to give me a story that I'm going to completely not give a shit about.
7979551	7980011	What is that?
7981653	7982753	The Fitty Game.
7983994	7990059	Blood on the Sand is going to be published by THQ.
7991240	7995903	Activision farted on the idea and said, we don't want this pile of steaming shit.
7996764	7999706	So THQ said, wait, we like shit.
8001601	8002722	Be fair, it doesn't look bad.
8002742	8007666	It's just over the top and with no base in reality whatsoever.
8008266	8012409	I mean, if they made Oscars for video games, this would so be nominated next year.
8012990	8015091	Well, it's coming out sometime.
8015952	8017073	Phew, rest easy.
8018214	8020255	Thank you, THQ, for giving the gamers.
8020275	8020916	Thank you, THQ, for our 50.
8020976	8025119	Well, I don't know.
8025139	8026580	They have like 50 cent and...
8028393	8029416	These games sell.
8030017	8030559	Exactly.
8030959	8031621	It'll sell.
8033063	8034864	You'd be surprised, I know, I know.
8035504	8037125	Alright, a couple more stories for you guys.
8037145	8040866	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8041386	8048830	Well, the new Xbox Experience, a brand new update that's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.
8049290	8052011	Everybody's been wondering, when the hell is this thing coming out?
8052091	8054732	Well, hopefully we have your answer now.
8055372	8059394	It was announced during Tokyo Game Show that it will be available to download online.
8060007	8061767	on November 19th.
8062327	8065368	So that's when you get your brand new Xbox experience.
8066168	8072729	The download will take up 128 megabytes of hard drive space or storage space.
8073589	8078990	People have been concerned and kind of in an uproar about, well, why is it going to require space?
8079030	8082091	There are some 360s that are sold without storage.
8082191	8083351	Well, I correct you.
8083711	8088652	There are no Xbox 360s currently being sold without storage of any kind.
8089292	8099717	If you remember, the arcade systems do come with a 256MB memory unit, so you can still enjoy the next Xbox experience, I guess.
8100577	8105620	And if you don't have a fucking memory card or hard drive, I mean, seriously, what the hell's wrong with you?
8106200	8107420	Just buy a hard drive.
8107440	8109541	Then you probably don't care about the new Xbox experience either.
8110102	8110442	Honestly.
8111423	8117725	So, um... Although I do still think it was a mistake for Microsoft to just not put the hard drive with all the systems.
8117825	8119825	I mean, they wanted to drive the price down, whatever.
8120386	8121566	Whatever, I mean, honestly.
8121886	8122326	It's fine.
8123206	8133069	The other thing that's rumored to be coming out on the 19th as well, well, apparently Home may be coming out that day as well to kind of counteract the whole new Xbox experience.
8133429	8138391	And it makes perfect sense to me, because even if it's not done, they're going to release it anyways, because it's still in beta.
8139744	8145823	Yeah, beta, awesome So yeah, expect that probably around the same time as well
8147902	8148242	All right.
8148703	8150324	Are you looking forward to the new Xbox experience?
8150364	8151144	I think it looks pretty cool.
8152165	8152925	I don't really.
8153606	8161171	There's one thing I'm looking forward to about it is that they are going to add new 16 by 10 screen formats.
8161871	8165294	So, like, for example, if I'm playing on my monitor that's 1400 by 900, I think by 900.
8171039	8179832	I can actually use the full screen now because before it was kind of stretched a little bit but now it'll actually be the native resolution for widescreen monitors.
8180373	8180574	Cool.
8181906	8182486	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8203779	8211102	And according to this Paula Hall, she was actually doing this whole study on premature ejaculation was actually what the study was all about.
8211222	8213383	Yes, that's what I said, premature ejaculation.
8213723	8215924	And you might be thinking, what the hell does this have to do with video games?
8216224	8219245	Well, it's because of an interesting comment she actually said as a part of this.
8219646	8223307	Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological.
8224228	8228929	These men with non-psychological premature ejaculation have very quick reflexes.
8229310	8232191	They may be excellent at playing tennis or computer games.
8234113	8262607	so apparently according to this chick there's some type of correlation between being a good gamer and finishing quickly in the bedroom maybe it's because they're just waiting to get back to the game that doesn't make any sense blame Paula Hall I don't know that still doesn't make any sense apparently what they're trying to do with this whole thing they're trying to actually make drugs to reduce the likelihood of premature ejaculation like Viagra in reverse I guess a little bit
8263544	8265125	Very interesting.
8265945	8267446	I wonder if this is a problem for women.
8269727	8270767	Premature ejaculation.
8270787	8271268	You know what?
8271628	8271908	What?
8273529	8275850	The problem for women is men.
8277771	8278691	Men are impatient.
8282113	8282873	Okay, I'm done.
8282893	8283533	Back to the game.
8283573	8284054	Thanks, lady.
8284074	8286015	You know what else is a problem, too?
8286135	8288736	Women keep nagging them when they're trying to play their games.
8290057	8292358	Honey, come to bed.
8292418	8293738	That's why God made toys.
8295838	8296138	All right.
8296699	8297359	Moving forward.
8297419	8297959	Yes, please.
8297979	8299339	We're going to go to the Skype line.
8299379	8301800	We're going to go to our phones.
8301820	8305120	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8305160	8306941	And hey, we've got a call on the line.
8306981	8308061	Hello, caller, are you there?
8309781	8310021	Yep.
8310422	8311122	Hey, who is this?
8312782	8313802	It's Rice Princess.
8314062	8315583	Hello, Rice Princess.
8315663	8316203	How are you?
8318246	8319147	Oh, I'm okay.
8319387	8319967	How are you?
8320167	8320567	I'm good.
8320608	8327512	We're hearing from a lot of local OLR folks tonight, because I don't know if you heard, but Extifer was on the show earlier talking about BlizzCon.
8329673	8331434	Oh, boo, BlizzCon.
8332255	8333716	Well, what did you call in to tell us about tonight?
8333736	8334616	I went to a cooler con.
8334996	8336297	Well, you went to a cooler con this week.
8336337	8337438	Did you go to Tokyo Game Show?
8339519	8339899	No.
8340120	8341601	Why would I go to that crap?
8342481	8346063	You went to a con that was cooler than Tokyo Game Show and BlizzCon combined?
8346343	8346844	Where did you go?
8348514	8350075	Yeah, I went to QQCon.
8350795	8351355	Awesome!
8351415	8352575	QQCon!
8352716	8353816	I went to QQCon, too.
8353856	8354816	I think I saw you there.
8354856	8357137	I mean, there was a lot of people there, but I think I saw you in the crowd.
8358777	8361438	Yeah, I think I ran across you once or twice.
8361718	8363139	I think so.
8363579	8367400	Tell the listeners something about QQCon, because I bet nobody's ever heard of QQCon.
8367480	8370881	But didn't you have something to do with the starting of QQCon?
8373077	8377580	No, it was actually organized by two of our friends, Mel and Eric.
8378601	8382503	But we just actually held it at our venue, aka our apartment.
8383804	8387206	And yeah, it's just awesome and free.
8388507	8388967	Free?
8389047	8390648	That's awesome.
8390708	8394030	Tell the listeners a little something about the idea behind QQCon.
8394090	8395591	Why was there a QQCon?
8395631	8397172	What were we celebrating at QQCon?
8398951	8409635	Oh, okay, well, you know how there was BlizzCon this weekend, and, like, you know, a lot of us didn't get to go because they had this ridiculous lottery system to have to, like, get tickets and stupid crap like that?
8409755	8410415	Yeah.
8410575	8420899	We just kind of had our own convention, and it's the QQCon because, as we all know, QQ means crying in the game, because the QQs look like crying eyes.
8421359	8426421	So we were all just basically convening to cry about not going to BlizzCon.
8427011	8430933	Was there any cosplay at the tournament, or at the convention, asked SSJ100 Matt.
8433475	8443621	There was no cosplay, but we all got swag in the form of Frostmourne, and we all welded them and played around with them and stuff.
8445422	8446142	If that counts.
8447243	8448984	Will there be a QQCon next year?
8450885	8451925	Absolutely.
8452045	8454427	There will be one every year from here on out.
8455575	8455996	Everyone's invited.
8456016	8457758	Of course, we would just have it in the hotel or something.
8477217	8484563	We might have to find a larger venue according to how many people actually sign up for next year's QQCon.
8484803	8488125	We'll have to see about that.
8488185	8491087	Any other video games you've been playing this week you want to tell our listeners about?
8493489	8493809	No.
8496611	8502175	I didn't play anything except for WarioWare at QQCon because it's the best con ever.
8502736	8504077	That's pretty much it.
8504117	8505658	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8507865	8510466	Um, yeah, you have to poop at QQCon.
8510486	8513508	I had YYCon.
8514208	8515249	What's YYCon?
8515969	8516669	YY!
8516949	8517530	It means yay.
8519571	8521191	Yes, I did have to poop at QQCon.
8523132	8524373	It's going to be an event next year.
8524473	8525293	Alright, I'm hanging up.
8525333	8527154	This joke's gone on way too long.
8528715	8529696	Bye, Rice Princess!
8531296	8531817	Bye.
8531957	8532297	Bye.
8532437	8533737	Did she just poop in the phone?
8533757	8534498	I think she did.
8535071	8536272	I don't think that was a poop.
8536492	8538893	I think it was a fart.
8539373	8540774	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8540814	8541254	Who's this?
8542655	8544156	Hi, this is Spaz.
8544596	8545677	Hey, what's up, Spaz?
8546998	8547458	Not much.
8548458	8552501	I just want to comment on something that you were saying earlier in the show.
8552821	8553021	Yes.
8554462	8558244	If I remember right, you were mentioning that you're considering getting a PlayStation 3.
8559084	8559545	The what?
8559605	8559905	I'm sorry?
8561484	8566026	If I remember right, you mentioned you're considering getting a PlayStation 3?
8566507	8569128	Yeah, I think it's past the point of consideration.
8569168	8570309	I think it's going to happen.
8570349	8571370	It's just a question of when.
8573611	8578234	Well, I'm fully in support of you getting it.
8578474	8582217	I think that if you do get it, you'll really enjoy it.
8582257	8588961	The only thing to bear in mind is that it wouldn't be a good idea to compare it to
8590652	8595415	The 360 in any way, because it's kind of, in its own way, its own beast.
8596196	8599958	If you try to compare it to the 360, you'll probably come off disappointed.
8601239	8607543	What kinds of cool things am I going to find on the PlayStation 3 that I'm not going to get on the Xbox 360, in your opinion?
8607603	8619571	Well, as you probably know, there's not a whole lot of system exclusives in terms of games, but what few there are, I think you may like...
8620643	8629529	stuff like Solcom, Warhawk, some of the downloadable original PlayStation 1 games.
8630010	8632811	They do have some, you know, interactive art there.
8632831	8637715	In fact, I was just talking about one with Bobby Blackwolf on his show.
8639316	8645100	And the most recent one is kind of weird, but it's still interesting nonetheless.
8647179	8657527	and then of course there's the whole PixelJunk series of games including PixelJunk Monsters which is kind of like a tower defense game which is pretty fun.
8658428	8664852	I could go on and on in terms of games but I don't want to take up too much time on the show.
8666333	8672178	And plus there's one benefit to the PlayStation 3's video store that
8676169	8689914	The 360 doesn't do all that well in the sense that with the 360, you can't always rent the movies, whereas PlayStation 3 gives you the choice between renting or outright buying.
8691474	8700457	Some people are kind of against renting, they would rather buy, because once you see the movie,
8701212	8704573	You know, you're basically out a couple bucks.
8704633	8713715	Whereas, you know, once you buy the movie, if you're outright buying the movie, you can watch it as many times as you want whenever you want.
8714295	8716716	Well, but doesn't the PlayStation 3 kind of do both?
8716776	8720157	Like, don't they have Blu-ray and they have a download service now?
8721837	8724238	Yeah, that's absolutely right.
8724278	8726638	So basically you have a choice.
8727138	8730159	Yeah, Blu-ray is a little bit more expensive.
8731330	8736853	But at the same time, you get all the extras.
8738134	8739154	It's in high def.
8739875	8745117	And since it's on the desk, it won't take up any space on your hard drive.
8746618	8751561	Whereas if you buy from the download service, you won't get the extras.
8752581	8757824	If you buy the movies, they'll be in standard definitions.
8758319	8759120	but you'll get a cheaper price point.
8759140	8762662	Well, actually, it may be 24 bucks in and around the area but at least in my area, which is in western New York, they're closer to like
8785026	8787248	on the cheap end, like $30, it's probably $35.
8800200	8806285	Anyway, sorry, just kind of a random tangent, but hey, that movie was actually pretty cheap because HD DVD had already bit the dust at that point when I got that.
8806986	8811449	Question from Frisbee in chat, and this will be the last one, then we're going to get to one more call before we end the show tonight.
8811909	8815092	Frisbee wants to know, is Blu-ray really that good?
8817754	8820396	Well, in my opinion, yes.
8820736	8828482	I mean, it's like to give an analogy in terms of games, it's
8829972	8845040	It's kind of like trying to play Halo 3 as opposed to the original NES version of Washington Attack.
8845080	8849963	That's in terms of graphics, not in terms of fun or anything like that.
8850744	8858748	Halo 3 is at least a bounce better than Washington Attack in terms of graphics.
8859908	8865891	You know, I think a big part of it, too, is that, you know, it's kind of like watching HDTV for the first time compared to regular TV.
8865951	8875234	I mean, true DVDs are a little, slightly better than regular TV, like the old TVs, because they can do interlaced, but, you know, it's just, you know, it's a big step.
8876034	8880496	So, well, anyway, hey, Spaz, we've got to wrap up, but do you have any quick last thoughts for our listeners?
8881777	8887439	Oh, yeah, obviously I can't do it now, but probably during the week, if you like, I can, like,
8888224	8895509	Send your email with a list of recommended games and whatnot that you can enjoy.
8895749	8896890	I'll always take a look, Spaz.
8896910	8898051	You can email that to me anytime.
8899271	8899512	Sure.
8899812	8900032	All right.
8900052	8900692	Have a good one.
8900752	8900953	All right.
8900973	8901453	You have a good one.
8901493	8901913	Take care, buddy.
8902794	8903094	All right.
8903114	8903394	You too.
8903434	8903734	Bye-bye.
8903834	8904135	Bye-bye.
8904415	8908177	We'll do one more call here on the skyline, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8908718	8909798	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8909838	8910179	Who's this?
8911038	8912880	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land.
8912920	8917424	It is he who is very uncreative and can't think of a way of describing himself tonight.
8917504	8918685	How about you just call yourself Jason?
8919106	8920067	Hey, yeah, that works too.
8920107	8920848	Hey, guys, it's Jason.
8921008	8921568	Hey, how you doing?
8921788	8922589	Hey, you know, it's so funny.
8922609	8925492	You can totally tell the difference between the telephone calls and the Skype calls.
8926393	8928255	The Skype calls really are pretty clear.
8928275	8929796	The internet takes off for phones pretty soon.
8930097	8930477	That's all right.
8930517	8931618	Hey, what's on your mind, Jason?
8933320	8933340	I...
8934181	8935882	Don't remember all of the details specifically.
8935922	8940604	I was driving into work and my iPhone tuner app was cutting out so I didn't get all of the conversation.
8940944	8945046	Oh my god, I keep forgetting that people can actually listen to this show in the car now because of Edge.
8945426	8946167	That is nuts.
8946827	8952670	We plug it straight into the car stereo and when 3G decides to actually work properly...
8953072	8955833	I can just be listening to whatever I want, in this case, the show.
8955873	8957074	That is amazing.
8957194	8958414	Technology has come so far.
8958695	8959935	You're going to have to tell me how you do that.
8959995	8961536	I don't know if you're looking at Justin.TV.
8961596	8964297	I just finally picked up the iPhone this week.
8965538	8966658	All I have is Twitterific.
8967738	8970540	I got Tap Tap Revolution or whatever it's called, Tap Tap Mania.
8970980	8972481	It's a terrible game.
8972681	8973601	Yeah, it's a little stupid.
8973841	8975062	I hated that game so bad.
8975942	8976883	I don't like Tuner.
8999295	8999775	AOL Radio is free.
8999795	9000156	They shouldn't...
9024451	9027596	The iPhones only sell unlimited data plans, right?
9028137	9028558	Yeah, they do.
9028938	9030060	It just blows my mind, though.
9030120	9031583	It's just your phone streaming the station.
9036001	9036261	Wow.
9036881	9037461	Anyhow, sorry.
9037541	9039002	I'm going to have to try that later.
9039022	9041942	It just blows my mind that somebody could be actually listening to us in the car right now.
9042302	9045523	Seven years ago, when we only had 12 listeners, I never thought that possible.
9045603	9053505	But we really are starting to reach that day and age where you will be able to listen to us like an over-the-air wave show.
9054065	9054465	We're there.
9055065	9056246	It's just not many people are doing it.
9056526	9057026	It's crazy.
9057906	9065668	If Sprint actually kicks into high gear and really gets WiMAXed everywhere, then it's going to be a really good day because then PSPs and all of the other non-cellular networks
9066058	9069740	but wireless capable devices are going to be able to do the same thing just about anywhere.
9070220	9070781	Anyway, I'm sorry.
9071041	9073002	You probably didn't call in to talk about Tuner.
9073122	9073663	Oh, I don't care.
9073703	9074483	I love technology.
9074543	9074943	Are you kidding me?
9074963	9076944	If you guys were a tech show, I'd be on here all the time.
9077125	9077725	Let me guess.
9078565	9084189	You probably had something to say about the beat and groovy or beat me because we've been talking a lot about music games tonight.
9084249	9085329	Beat and groovy is a joke.
9086550	9087591	I was going to say two things.
9087631	9089192	That was going to be the shorter of two things.
9089792	9092093	I reiterate what I said before, but I make it worse.
9092414	9094375	Konami needs to stop releasing in America.
9096638	9099419	They're not going to hold a candle to what every other company has now done.
9100100	9109163	And while I think Scratch looks really terrible, it's probably going to perform better, look better, and work better than Beatmania US, quite unfortunately.
9109223	9111704	And it's probably going to do better because of the music choice.
9112904	9114085	They never should have closed Hawaii.
9115845	9117506	And they never should have moved Konami SoCal.
9117846	9117986	Nope.
9118433	9119593	or Dorkel, whichever.
9119833	9126274	I mean, and a lot of us gave Konami Hawaii a lot of shit when that first DDR game came out on Xbox, but boy did the second one shut us all up.
9126654	9130055	I mean, it seemed like they, more than any other division, were really listening to people.
9130095	9132636	I thought we gave them shit because they released DDR PC.
9134196	9136836	But without DDR PC, we would have never had Mr. Spanky.
9136956	9138417	So, case in point.
9140617	9141277	Anyhow, sorry.
9141757	9143817	What else besides beaten groovy?
9144018	9144618	Beaten yucky?
9145658	9146558	Old and crappy.
9147125	9148426	I'm pretty wrong on StarCraft 2.
9149888	9157435	The way that they're veiling this, if I'm understanding correctly, I'm seeing two sides to the story, but neither of your opinions matched it.
9157655	9158636	So here's my take.
9159937	9169286	The release date is, I don't know if this has actually been mentioned, but the release date for the three StarCraft 2s is probably going to be on the same day or very, very close together, isn't it?
9171155	9171875	I haven't the clue.
9172216	9174097	I didn't follow BlizzCon that closely.
9174397	9176398	I don't think it's been announced.
9176418	9179379	It's just the fact that it's going to be a trilogy and that's what everybody's going over.
9180280	9190205	The same thing that Bobby was saying, and I'll do it in the same way as him, you're going to buy one game three times, you're going to buy one game three times, and you will buy one game three times.
9190245	9191226	He's absolutely correct.
9191646	9197449	They are going to take one game, give the same features on all three to play with other people.
9197889	9198569	That's a good feature.
9198609	9199730	I'm glad they're doing that.
9200467	9201088	and DarkSakura.
9229736	9244470	I'm hoping and assuming that they're going to make it a little bit cheaper because $150 just to play a game that presumably you'll want to complete paying $150 is going to be excessive and I'm really hoping that each game is going to be
9246173	9248334	25 and 30 even makes it a little bit better.
9248374	9249614	Cheaper than that would be great.
9250014	9253575	But I'm seriously hoping that all three do not come out at 50 bucks a piece.
9253795	9259876	But if one does multiplayer, I mean, there's a bunch of people that only play StarCraft for multiplayer.
9260197	9261297	I mean, the hell with single player.
9261577	9263037	As a matter of fact, this is the funny thing.
9263837	9267618	A couple of months ago, I finally got StarCraft to work on OSX.
9267918	9269059	I have a MacBook Pro, by the way.
9270059	9273860	Anyways, I finally got StarCraft to work on my Mac.
9274140	9275020	And I've been playing through it.
9275587	9277810	I've been playing the campaign and nothing else.
9278951	9281674	The real rub is I'm playing it without cheats because I've never done that.
9282254	9285217	But I'm playing through the campaigns and nothing else.
9285658	9288461	Especially now that StarCraft 2 is coming out, I want to keep doing that.
9291664	9298191	And all three of the races, I don't prefer the Terrans, but that doesn't mean I don't want to play their campaigns.
9298516	9301638	The story in the first one was magnificent.
9301999	9304641	And I want to play that the whole way through.
9304961	9307563	Probably multiple times based off what I'm hearing they're doing.
9307823	9310825	I'm very curious to see, because Blizzard's pretty in tune with their fanbase.
9310845	9313587	I'm very curious to see how they kind of respond to the negativity.
9313607	9314848	Because you know they will this week.
9314908	9316189	We'll have a follow-up on this.
9316410	9318011	I'm really hoping that they do it for cheaper.
9318251	9320553	Because it would make sense, and they're very good at that.
9321794	9322014	Alright.
9322234	9324676	Well, Jason, we've got to wrap up and get the show on out of here.
9324696	9326077	But do you have any last thoughts?
9326772	9331659	Your Netflix achievement was hilarious, and I want to see it happen.
9332199	9332540	Thank you.
9332680	9335223	And if you have no idea what we're talking about, you'll have to listen to Bobby's show.
9335423	9336966	So there's a plug for Bobby.
9337186	9337466	Do it.
9337887	9339689	Allgames.com, iTunes, podcast.
9341081	9343323	And while you're there, leave us a nice review too.
9343343	9354554	By the way, I gotta say, speaking of the iTunes reviews, and if you don't already know, you can leave reviews on iTunes and it really helps in the ranking of the show and it gets it a little higher in the list the more people find us.
9354574	9360200	There was a really awesome review left this week and I want to at least try to acknowledge people that leave reviews.
9360540	9361601	I think it was Let's Have Tea.
9362642	9368666	It just says Let's Have, and then it's cut off, but I'm almost positive that's the only name I've seen around is Let's Have Tea that would fit.
9369027	9375251	And they say, I've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio for a few years now, and still today I've yet to find a podcast that has nearly the same feel as OLR does.
9375631	9379494	After a few episodes, you'll begin to feel like these people are your friends rather than your entertainers.
9379794	9383236	Half of that is because the show is made up of three people who are good friends outside the show.
9384457	9386459	Aww, doesn't that give you warm fuzzies all over?
9386679	9387479	Make you a little nauseous?
9387579	9387719	Aww.
9388240	9388340	Aww.
9388860	9389421	So anyway, sorry.
9390361	9392042	We love the positive reviews.
9393543	9396085	Jason, we've got to let you go to wrap up, okay?
9399047	9399367	Bye-bye.
9399627	9400568	I don't think you can hear me.
9400628	9401108	Oh, see ya!
9402089	9403430	That was kind of an awkward end.
9404771	9405031	Alright.
9406051	9406212	Yeah.
9406512	9410254	TheRobD says, gives you warm fuzzies until someone's outside your door asking to hang out.
9410514	9415518	Well, that's why we always say that, hey, we're based out of Sacramento, but that's about all we tell you.
9415538	9415778	Yeah.
9417500	9419181	It's a big place, over a million people.
9419661	9421903	All right, anyhow, hey, we've got to wrap up the show.
9422023	9422863	It's that time.
9423364	9425565	Before we wrap up, though, some quick last-minute stories.
9425905	9426826	I actually want to start tonight.
9426886	9428947	TigerClaw sent me this link, and I thought it was pretty funny.
9429487	9431068	Microsoft is suing DHL.
9431108	9432009	You know who DHL is?
9432029	9435171	They're kind of like FedEx, UPS, but they're like number three, I think.
9435371	9436372	But they hire convicts.
9436732	9437472	Well, here's the thing.
9437512	9441215	Well, apparently it's come to a head there because DHL lost 21,600 Xbox consoles.
9443696	9444116	Damn!
9444216	9444917	Well, here's the thing.
9445037	9446417	A train derailed in Texas.
9446978	9450639	So because of the train derailment... Derailed right into my garage!
9451560	9452460	This is everything.
9452620	9454041	Again, this is coming from a lawsuit.
9454401	9455742	It's been filed in Seattle, of course.
9455762	9456622	That's where Microsoft's based.
9457182	9459464	$2 million in damages from DHL is what they want.
9459524	9464686	It's because of two containers of Xbox consoles that had impact damage, wetting, pilfering, and storage.
9465326	9467007	And the train derailed around Duke, Texas.
9467327	9469288	So suddenly there's tons of Xbox users in Texas.
9469468	9470829	If only it were Duke Nukem, Texas.
9471169	9473610	By the way, this happened on October 13th, 2007.
9474150	9478593	So it was quite some time ago, but the legal stuff is slow right now.
9478753	9479773	So there you have it.
9480594	9483495	By the way, usually you would just go, well, it's an accident.
9483515	9484375	Why are they being so mean?
9484455	9495721	Nope, they are saying in the lawsuit that a DHL has not compensated it for the loss and that the delivery service, again, according to the lawsuit, quote, negligently breached it.
9495761	9496741	This is why I'm not real radio.
9497001	9500063	Breached its duties as a common carrier, handler, bailee,
9501103	9514053	Warehouseman, Agent, or in its other capabilities so they're basically saying you done fucked up and ruined all our Xboxes because of it and so that's why they were so short on Xboxes a year ago there you have it anyhow
9515943	9520905	Rob D speaks up in chat and says, someone wet on two containers of 360 controllers?
9521265	9523366	Keep those 360s out of the bathroom.
9523426	9524586	I knew that was a bad idea.
9525106	9529688	I think when they fell out of the train, they got in the rain in Spain on the plane.
9530828	9532869	Do you have any last-minute stories, Loki?
9533009	9533749	Yes, I do, actually.
9533849	9534270	Sure, what's up?
9535030	9537731	All right, a bunch of interesting stuff.
9538905	9543489	First off, X and A games are showing up on Xbox Live, apparently now.
9543729	9547372	I have yet to go actually check this out, but apparently they started launching them.
9547492	9549333	I think that's what the last update was, remember?
9549373	9553917	They had a live down for a day or so, and they were tweaking some shit.
9555117	9559000	But anyways, apparently there are some errors popping up right now, but it says...
9559721	9562822	There's two titles that seem to be unplayable to average users.
9563383	9568485	With XNA Creators Club launcher errors popping up even if you have the program installed.
9568985	9571286	I don't know, so maybe it's something coming.
9571987	9576629	But apparently they had both a free demo and the full version is priced at 100 Microsoft points.
9578309	9580250	100 Microsoft points ain't a lot.
9581231	9586153	Shown at Tokyo Game Show, Nobi Nobi Boy, which has the most...
9587728	9589790	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9610530	9619436	Left 4 Dead, the demo has been confirmed to be coming out early November, so that'll be fun to check out on the Xbox 360 and PC.
9620716	9627100	Also, another demo that's been kind of confirmed, Mirror's Edge, apparently coming November 6th.
9627140	9637327	This has actually been revealed via GameStop's website, because on their little bonus offer thing there, it says, special note, Mirror's Edge demo will be available for download November 6th.
9638267	9638968	Hmm, interesting.
9640893	9645335	Lots of Xbox Live Arcade games announced at Tokyo Game Show.
9645555	9647076	Lots and lots and lots of stuff.
9647496	9648177	King of Fighters 98.
9648577	9652959	There's going to be a brand new Arkanoid game coming to...
9654517	9655698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9671707	9673627	R-Type 1 and 2 Other games coming out...
9696025	9713967	Dodon Pachi and I guess that came out in Japan only but I don't even know if that's an Xbox Live arcade game but they have some screens for the new R-Type game looks awesome awesome awesome and let's see I know I've got a lot more here sorry
9716181	9722683	There's a new t-shirt that was shown at Tokyo Game Show for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
9723984	9724404	Pretty cool.
9724444	9725385	I think Jimmy would like that.
9726385	9729126	And what was I going to say here?
9731238	9733139	I gave Rob a video for this.
9733519	9737922	They announced... Remember that Rock Band reality show?
9738482	9744585	Well, apparently Rock Band 2 The Stars will be premiering on VH1 Classic this month.
9745325	9747246	And there's a little promo video for it.
9748689	9755131	Not really sure what it is, but it says, On October 15th, VH1 Classic will premiere a new reality show called Rock Band to the Stars.
9755511	9767755	It will feature Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach as they play hosts to 12 wannabe rockers as they live in a mansion competing in different Rock Band 2 competitions.
9768195	9769996	Here you go, courtesy of EW.com.
9770489	9772430	Welcome to Rock Band to the Stars.
9772650	9774171	This is about Rock Band 2.
9774211	9783115	Two legendary frontmen, Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper, will choose their ultimate rock band bands from a pool of 15 rabid rock band masters.
9783355	9783475	Wow!
9785282	9798508	each week the players will face grueling challenges and painful eliminations oh my god to find out who rules in all things Rock Band 2 Rock Band to the Stars premieres this Wednesday during Jumpstart Videos are you ready to rock?
9798688	9806811	only on VH1 looks a little silly looks very low budget very very low budget what does TV come to?
9808912	9811293	I don't know I get it, it's a little play on words there
9811894	9817738	Yeah, another funny thing, you know how they have in-game advertising for different things?
9818598	9819559	EA has a lot of it.
9819739	9825862	Well, Burnout Paradise apparently has Barack Obama banners now on their billboards.
9826823	9828864	Very interesting advertising, by the way.
9831583	9834724	And apparently there's a rumor that IGN let slip a new Wii channel.
9834784	9836685	I think we may have talked about this briefly last week.
9837005	9839046	You know how there was that Band Brothers DX channel?
9839086	9844188	Well, they're saying that maybe there's a new channel coming out for Guitar Hero to use your DS on the Wii.
9844248	9846388	So it's kind of similar to that, but with Guitar Hero.
9847069	9847349	Huh.
9847689	9849209	That's kind of cool.
9849450	9851850	And then... Let's see here.
9852651	9857512	One thing I thought would be funny to mention, Rob, there's a video advertising...
9859833	9860734	Dukapon Kingdom.
9861514	9867399	And the one thing that they do show advertised on there is they named their character Sassy Pants.
9867900	9868560	Awesome!
9868720	9869301	What game was this?
9869761	9870802	Dukapon Kingdom.
9870982	9871763	They took it from me.
9872143	9873384	That's my WoW character name, by the way.
9873504	9875045	Sassy Pants.
9875666	9876607	And that's it.
9878137	9880478	DarkSakura, anything in your neck of the woods?
9880898	9881058	No.
9881598	9881919	Alright.
9882399	9883499	Oh, we just got this in.
9884200	9885100	Late breaking news.
9885140	9889522	This is kind of a follow-up to the whole DHL and Microsoft thing going on.
9889842	9894464	Well, DHL has released its defense as to why all the Xboxes got wet.
9919261	9920182	Come on, Microsoft.
9924945	9926886	Don't put the blame on us, Microsoft.
9927847	9930369	It's not like we got out the hose.
9932490	9934372	Why can't they just own up to it, okay?
9935472	9937034	No, this is so stupid.
9938759	9943961	I don't give a shit whatever their fucking reason is.
9946722	9951204	While it's in their hands, it's in their care, therefore their responsibility.
9951484	9952444	You fucking own up.
9953665	9954125	Whatever.
9957286	9959427	And you know what Microsoft would say to you, DarkSakra?
9961028	9962668	Girl, you know it's true.
9964749	9966270	Ooh, ooh, ooh.
9969164	9969504	PeanutButter
9988493	9990773	And that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
