7000	14000	With your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Loco UK
14000	27000	Tonight, October 12, 2008, rumors about Blu-ray on 360 surface again, a next-gen Castlevania gets teased, and will YouTube soon sell you games?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	38000	Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast where every gamer has a voice.
38000	44000	For the next few hours, we're going to talk about video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
44000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you for the next few hours, as will the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
50000	52000	I will be not joining everybody for the next few hours.
52000	54000	Where are you going, young lady?
54000	55000	Out of body.
55000	58000	Alright, well have fun and let us know how it goes.
58000	59000	Sure thing, Rob.
59000	61000	Where are you going to be visiting? Are you going to go to Disneyland and back?
61000	62000	Yep.
62000	64000	Alright, have fun. Ride Space Mountain for me.
64000	65000	Woohoo.
65000	69000	Alright, and also say hello to Tech Master, Loki, who's giggling like a schoolgirl, over here.
69000	70000	I'm not giggling like a schoolgirl.
70000	75000	Yes you are. I was doing the opening and I hear, he, like, it's not your hamburger that you're eating.
75000	77000	No, Rob, that was the people that you hear in your head.
77000	79000	Apparently. Okay, great, you're going out of body.
79000	80000	That was your voices.
80000	82000	I have voices in my head. Loki is a schoolgirl?
82000	83000	Loki has a sandwich.
83000	87000	I'm watching the game, because watching, because you can't actually play the game.
87000	88000	Right.
88000	89000	Don't shoot the puppy.
89000	91000	Wait, is your mic on? You're very, very quiet tonight for some reason.
91000	92000	I have no on-off button.
92000	94000	Oh, there you go. Well, you just weren't talking into it right.
94000	96000	Alright, sorry, go ahead. So don't shoot the puppy?
96000	97000	Yeah, don't shoot the puppy.
97000	103000	The puppy walks, hops across the screen very happily, but it gets slower every level.
103000	107000	And you just keep getting, you know, it's a test of patience.
107000	114000	And if you get frustrated and you push a button, it shoots the puppy with, like, this giant artillery cannon.
114000	117000	This sounds terrible. Wait, this is a flash game or something?
117000	120000	Yes, it is.
120000	124000	And that's the whole game. You just sit there. Can I see this?
124000	126000	Can I, can I? I know this is horrible radio, but can I?
126000	127000	What the hell?
127000	128000	What happened? Did you shoot the puppy?
128000	130000	Oh, no, I clicked the button and it's...
130000	132000	You'll just have to show me later. This is horrible radio.
132000	134000	It's hilarious.
134000	138000	Apparently, Peeta has just joined our chat room and is currently protesting the show.
138000	139000	Oh, there we go.
139000	140000	Peeta's full of shit.
140000	144000	Oh, it's a cute little stick figure puppy. Okay, sister. Aww.
144000	146000	Does it bark and stuff?
146000	148000	I don't know. I don't know. I don't have the sound on.
148000	156000	This is coming from a website, rrrrthats5rs.com, even though there's only four.
156000	157000	Grrrr.
157000	160000	Okay, so shoot it.
160000	168000	Oh, that's terrible! At least it's only a cartoon, it's not like the real thing.
168000	175000	So wait, again, the website? RRRR, that's five R's even though it's really only four.
175000	177000	Love that sense of humor, that's something else.
177000	182000	Anyhow, hey, you guys are joining us in chat.
182000	184000	Chat.orangelaunchy.com here live on this Sunday evening.
184000	186000	Ew! DJ Dysentery?
186000	189000	Yes, DJ Dysentery. I think DJ Dysentery's listened to the show before.
189000	192000	I know, but that just makes me think of Pooh.
192000	195000	DJ Dysentery's in chat and says, I don't think there's sound.
195000	197000	So. So.
197000	201000	Alright, as Jamie complains about the climate in the Orange Lounge Radio Studio,
201000	203000	it was warm in here earlier and now it's really cool and off fast.
203000	206000	Alright, enough about the weather, let's talk about our gaming weeks.
206000	209000	That's how we always start off the show, talking about some video games.
209000	211000	Dark Sakura, what have you played this week?
211000	213000	I have disproven the old theory.
213000	214000	What theory is that?
214000	219000	That Airman can be defeated after all.
219000	221000	Because I played Mega Man 2.
221000	222000	Awesome.
222000	223000	Yesterday.
223000	225000	Old school gaming on, right?
225000	226000	Sure did.
226000	230000	And I also have proven that I can no longer do the blindfold trick.
230000	234000	Oh, you said, what level was it you could clear blindfolded?
234000	235000	Airman?
235000	237000	No. No, it was the dragon.
237000	239000	Oh, the wily dragon, that's right.
239000	240000	The wily dragon.
240000	241000	Mm-hmm, okay.
241000	244000	Well, GS68, you're great.
244000	247000	People for the unethical shit-talking of humans.
247000	249000	Puesto? I've never heard of that.
249000	250000	Puesto.
250000	251000	Anyway, Puesto.
251000	253000	No, PETA is people eating tasty animals.
253000	254000	Alright, come on, enough PETA talk.
254000	256000	Well, PETA's full of shit anyway.
256000	257000	Alright.
257000	263000	Well, but I played some Mega Man 2 and we actually were playing through Mega Man 9.
263000	265000	Dan and his buddy Jeff were.
265000	270000	And there's some really annoying levels in that game.
270000	273000	To a man's level is kind of annoying.
273000	276000	Is it weird to go back and visit Mega Man 2 after playing Mega Man 9?
276000	280000	Like, they actually have a lot in common, except 2 was a lot easier here in America.
280000	283000	Mega Man 2 had more drops.
283000	288000	And if I'm correct, the difficult mode was the default mode for the Japanese version.
288000	289000	It sure was.
289000	301000	And another thing is that we were talking about the Mega Man 2 Anniversary Edition that came out on PlayStation and how it was a lot harder.
301000	303000	Because it was based off the Japanese one, if I remember right.
303000	305000	No, it was harder than that.
305000	308000	It was harder than that because we went through and played on difficult mode.
308000	310000	Oh, that's so wrong.
310000	311000	What?
311000	312000	Sorry.
312000	314000	Don't shoot the puppy.
314000	316000	Sorry to go back to that again.
316000	322000	But the game does get harder because there will be little pop-up ads that come up.
322000	324000	But they're all part of the game.
324000	327000	And if you move the mouse or anything, it shoots the puppy.
327000	329000	So they're like, oh, I got to click that pop-up ad.
329000	331000	Oh, dead.
331000	332000	I love that.
332000	334000	I love that this show gets derailed so easily.
334000	335000	Go ahead.
335000	339000	Well, at any rate, we also tried a Proto Man mode.
339000	341000	And it's freaking kind of tough, too.
341000	344000	Because he takes double damage, but he has the shield.
344000	353000	And it would be really hard to make it through the wily stages with Proto Man.
353000	358000	Also, I've played Ragnarok.
358000	359000	Ragnarok.
359000	360000	Crack rock.
360000	362000	All right.
362000	364000	And I did homework.
364000	366000	All right, so Mega Manorific.
366000	368000	I also watched the debate game, too.
368000	369000	Awesome.
369000	370000	And voted.
370000	371000	I voted this week.
371000	372000	Awesome.
372000	374000	As everybody should.
374000	376000	No matter who you support, you should go out and vote.
376000	378000	Because voting is important.
378000	380000	And if you don't vote, you don't get to complain about the result.
380000	381000	Right?
381000	382000	All right.
382000	384000	Anyhow, let's move on.
384000	386000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
386000	387000	It was all right.
387000	389000	I only really played a couple things.
389000	391000	Grand Theft Auto IV, as usual.
391000	396000	And I also played more Saints Row 2 because that game's awesome.
396000	398000	Now I'm finished with the Brotherhood storyline.
398000	403000	And I'm starting the Sons of Samiti.
403000	405000	And that's kind of interesting.
405000	412000	And I tried to play some online deathmatch today, but it was hard to join the game.
412000	414000	So I ended up quitting on that.
414000	418000	And then I played a bit of Fable II.
418000	424000	And got past the child stage and started your adult life.
424000	427000	And really got distracted with dancing in front of people.
427000	429000	And then I got an achievement for it.
429000	431000	And that's where I quit.
431000	433000	So, yeah.
433000	434000	Awesome.
434000	437000	Well, you've been getting a sneak peek at a lot of early holiday games.
437000	439000	Because Fable II's not out for a couple weeks, right?
439000	440000	That's right.
440000	442000	And Saints Row II is out, what, this week?
442000	443000	Tuesday.
443000	444000	Finally?
444000	446000	Well, at least you'll finally have some people to play multiplayer with.
446000	447000	Awesome.
447000	448000	It'll be cool.
448000	450000	And keep finding new things to do in that game.
450000	451000	It's awesome.
451000	454000	So you didn't really spend a whole lot of time with Fable II, so you can't tell us a whole lot more about it.
454000	456000	Like, how does it compare to the first one?
456000	459000	I never played the first one, so that I really can't tell you.
459000	460000	Gotcha.
460000	461000	All right.
461000	462000	Well, let's see.
462000	463000	Moving on.
463000	464000	My gaming week.
464000	466000	You know, I've been playing a variety of stuff.
466000	467000	Pretty much the old stuff.
467000	468000	You know, the old standbys.
468000	470000	Warcraft and so on.
470000	472000	But I did check out a couple new games.
472000	474000	Beat and Groovy on Xbox Live Arcade.
474000	478000	You know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're long-time music game fans.
478000	483000	I mean, you know, the roots of our station, the name of the station, comes from old school music games.
483000	486000	And you actually see it show up in this game, Beat and Groovy.
486000	488000	Because one of the songs is by a group called Orange Lounge.
488000	491000	And that's kind of where the name of our radio station came from.
491000	496000	Well, I would usually encourage you to buy a game like Beat and Groovy.
496000	498000	But you know what, guys?
498000	500000	It's just not that great.
500000	505000	And I know that sounds horrible, because poppy music is a pretty awesome game franchise.
505000	506000	But here's the problem.
506000	511000	Is that they want to charge you $10 for 9 songs.
511000	518000	And not only is it 9 songs, but it's 9 songs kind of thrown together that you have no choice to play with but the controller.
518000	522000	You cannot remap the buttons in this game, which is very annoying.
522000	525000	Because two of the buttons use the control pad.
525000	528000	And actually, a third one kind of shares it too.
528000	531000	I play the way where you use the D-pad for only 2.
531000	537000	But you sometimes accidentally hit the third one if you kind of like flick the D-pad too fast.
537000	539000	So that sucks.
539000	543000	Gosh, and here's the thing.
543000	549000	Beat and Groovy would have been like the shit in 1998 on the Playstation 1.
549000	554000	Because it's probably not that different from what the first release of poppy music was in Japan.
554000	558000	So somebody up there at Konami of Japan is thinking,
558000	566000	Oh, well if the first release of poppy music did well in Japan, we're going to mirror the first release of American poppy music off of it.
566000	568000	Even though we're not going to have a controller and put in some different songs.
568000	570000	It just doesn't work.
570000	573000	I mean, there's so many just borked things about this game.
573000	576000	And it's unfortunate because there's a good game in here somewhere.
576000	577000	I know, I've seen it.
577000	581000	I've seen the import versions of poppy music, which are some really fun music games.
581000	584000	And it's a shame that now people who don't get music games,
584000	587000	or people that think that Guitar Hero was the first music game ever made,
587000	589000	or maybe like Frequency or Amplitude,
589000	593000	are going to think that this whole franchise is just total crap based off of this.
593000	596000	I mean, A, you can't remap the controls.
596000	600000	When you play online, you can only play online in three button mode.
600000	607000	The hardest song is three notes on a scale of one to nine, basically.
607000	612000	So you know this game is built to just have microtransactions added on top of it.
612000	613000	They're going to try to add new songs.
613000	616000	They're going to try to add new difficulties and all this stuff.
616000	621000	I really urge you guys, I don't think you should support this.
621000	627000	I mean, and it sounds horrible because I've always been a big supporter of Konami and the music game series,
627000	629000	and I love DDR, and I love BeatMania 2DX.
629000	630000	Oh my god, I love BeatMania 2DX.
630000	635000	But if this is what we're going to get, is these type of scraps, I reject it.
635000	639000	And I don't think we should have to support it simply because it's pop and music,
639000	641000	and simply because it's the game we want to see.
641000	646000	And I'm sorry, I reject those calls that say we should buy this because then we might get this.
646000	647000	I'm sorry, no.
647000	650000	We don't live in that day and age anymore.
650000	657000	If Konami hasn't learned the lesson by now that Americans are willing to latch on to good music games,
657000	659000	then they're just not going to get it.
659000	666000	So I see no need to buy this game to somehow justify them to fix it and put out the game they should have in the first place.
666000	672000	That being said, I did buy the game, but I felt some type of editorial obligation to because I don't get them for free,
672000	675000	and I wanted to give you a fair impression here on the show.
675000	677000	But again, this game is just so borked.
677000	682000	By the way, the leaderboards, you would think the leaderboard scores would be like endless mode,
682000	684000	or who got the highest score on this song.
684000	690000	Nope, it's one leaderboard, and it's for online mode, and it's not even wins versus losses.
690000	692000	It's a cumulative score.
692000	696000	So in other words, the person who's ranked number one on the beat-and-groovy leaderboard
696000	699000	is just the person who's played the most matches online and gotten the highest score because of it.
699000	700000	That's dumb.
700000	701000	It's dumb.
701000	706000	This game is borked in so many ways, and it's really, really sad.
706000	709000	I looked at video, and it made my heart break a little bit.
709000	712000	There you go.
712000	717000	So honestly, I mean, again, it's sad because I think there could have been a good game here,
717000	721000	but for right now, if you want to play a decent music game on Xbox Live Arcade, just go get Boom Boom Rocket.
721000	722000	It's the same concept.
722000	724000	You mash buttons to things when they hit a line.
724000	726000	It's a lot better looking.
726000	729000	I wish I could say the music's better in Boom Boom Rocket,
729000	736000	but actually that would be the one thing that Pop'n Music has on the other game, Boom Boom Rocket,
736000	739000	is that the song list is slightly better, even if it is nine songs.
739000	747000	There's some pretty good songs in it, like Moon and Star Mine and the Earth whatever song that sounds like the...
747000	749000	Yeah, that song's pretty cool too.
749000	750000	Hey, Rob.
750000	751000	What?
751000	753000	We should go to my house and play Pop'n Music.
753000	754000	We should.
754000	758000	I mean, honestly, if you want to play a great music game that's like Beat'n Groovy,
758000	761000	go import Pop'n Music. Seriously.
761000	764000	I really, really, really want an arcade-style controller.
764000	766000	Yeah, they are fun. I had a friend that had one.
766000	767000	They're fun.
767000	770000	It's just kind of weird that they would release this game with no controller here.
770000	771000	I know.
771000	776000	It makes no sense because, I mean, have you ever tried to play Pop'n Music on the PlayStation controller?
776000	777000	Yeah.
777000	778000	It's freaking hard.
778000	781000	Although it is kind of fun to try it on the 2DX controller.
781000	787000	Now, our buddy Bobby Black Wolf actually did this pretty awesome YouTube that compares Beat'n Groovy to Pop'n Music 13.
787000	791000	The note charts are the exact same, which is fine.
791000	792000	I understand that.
792000	799000	I mean, I don't hold that against them except for the fact that sometimes you have the purple and the blue notes come up back to back,
799000	802000	and when you have to use a control pad for both of those, it makes it hard.
802000	809000	You can't hit two on the control pad at the same time, and you can kind of do upper left, but it's mixed results at best.
809000	812000	And what if you have the purple and the orange?
812000	816000	Well, I guess you can hit one with the Y, but still, it just, bleh.
816000	817000	Doesn't work.
817000	819000	You need to be able to remap the buttons.
819000	821000	This game has just too many bugs in it.
821000	824000	They need to go back to the drawing board.
824000	826000	That's really it as far as new games.
826000	831000	I did play Feeding Frenzy 2, which reminded me, of course, a lot of the first one with some different bonuses,
831000	833000	but I didn't play it enough to give it a full review.
833000	834000	But I did enjoy myself.
834000	843000	I enjoyed myself in probably the ten minutes I played Feeding Frenzy 2 more than I did probably the hour I spent with Beat'n Groovy just having a cry.
843000	845000	I forgot to mention with Saints Row 2.
845000	852000	All the cheat codes leaked online, including those wonderful exclusive codes that GameStop had if you pre-ordered the game.
852000	854000	No to anyone buying anything from GameStop.
854000	861000	If it has a code involved with it, and it's not actually a Microsoft code where you download something off of their service, it's going to leak out immediately.
861000	863000	And that's fun.
863000	865000	They have the Evil Cars code in there.
865000	874000	They have a code to get, like, a pocket bike, and then you can do a code to make yourself even larger so it looks like you're just sitting down and driving that way.
874000	876000	Super explosions, yeah.
876000	879000	Reading some comments from chatroom about Beat'n Groovy.
879000	886000	GS68 says, when if I somehow get a job over the winter, I'll use the monies for a desktop arcade and one of the CS releases.
886000	888000	Yeah, that'll probably be a better investment.
888000	892000	DJ Dysentery says, well, props for Starmine at least.
892000	895000	I agree, it does seem like they kind of tried to throw us a bone or two on the song list.
895000	897000	They gave us some really cool songs.
897000	898000	But, yeah.
898000	907000	Well, did you notice that the game, I mean, I didn't even play it at all, but just from the videos, the game has, like, this urban vibe to it, and then there's Super Eurobeat in there.
907000	909000	It's like, huh?
909000	916000	Well, it's, you know what, this game wasn't, it's weird, because I feel like this game wasn't really made for America, even though it came out here.
916000	919000	It definitely caters to the Japanese style.
919000	924000	SSJ100Matt says, it tried to be like Boom Boom Rocket, except it wasn't fun.
924000	932000	That's kind of the whole thing, though, is that it wasn't trying to be Boom Boom Rocket, because this game's been out for years and years before Boom Boom Rocket.
932000	940000	It's just that, unfortunately, that's the impression most people are going to have of this game, because of the fact that it's lackluster in many, many departments.
940000	941000	And it pains me to say that.
941000	944000	I know there is a great game in there somewhere.
944000	947000	I've played pop music 11, 12, 10, 8.
947000	949000	I've played tons of pop music games.
949000	951000	It's way fun, especially with that giant controller.
951000	953000	This, not fun.
953000	965000	I wonder if they just, you know, said, hey, you know, let's just go ahead and have a company make pop music for us for the 360 and Xbox Live Arcade.
965000	971000	And they get it back and they're like, crap, this sucks, let's call it Beaten Groovy instead, because we don't want to tarnish the pop music name.
971000	974000	I think the first half of what you said is spot on.
974000	976000	I think this game was to outsource for completion.
976000	983000	And I think whoever was in charge of some of the decisions needs to be whipped with a wet noodle.
983000	984000	That's all.
984000	985000	Anyhow.
985000	988000	What if it, though, is testing the waters?
988000	991000	Then they failed.
991000	992000	For potential release.
992000	997000	That's what fucking bugs me about Konami of Japan, is that they shouldn't have to.
997000	1003000	If you want to see if a music game is going to do good here in America, fucking look at Guitar Hero and Rock Band.
1003000	1009000	If they're not going to, God, it just makes me angry how fucking dense they are in not understanding the music.
1009000	1013000	I mean, they have a fucking cult based around these music games here in America.
1013000	1018000	And they just, they turn a blind eye to it all the time and release crap like this.
1018000	1020000	Well, it worked in Japan, so it must work in America.
1020000	1022000	Ten years ago it worked in Japan.
1022000	1024000	Times have changed.
1024000	1025000	The bar has been risen.
1025000	1028000	Wake up, Konami of Japan.
1028000	1029000	Wake up.
1029000	1032000	Rob for president.
1032000	1034000	Twelve.
1034000	1036000	No, I'm kidding.
1036000	1037000	F that.
1037000	1038000	Make me CEO of Konami.
1038000	1042000	I'll go change some things real quick.
1042000	1043000	Alright.
1043000	1044000	Anyhow.
1044000	1045000	Let's move on.
1045000	1048000	Sorry, GS68, the FUs are not coming up next.
1048000	1051000	We have those, believe me, there's other things to piss you off later in the show.
1051000	1053000	Alright, look, we've got to get into gaming news.
1053000	1054000	Let's talk about housekeeping a little bit.
1054000	1060000	First off, for those listening live tonight, last week's show archive never got put up because I'm slow.
1060000	1062000	And I got very busy this week, so I apologize.
1062000	1070000	Folks that are listening to this on the podcast, you will have already seen 297 finally fall in probably tonight or Monday at the absolute latest.
1070000	1073000	And 298 should be right up on Tuesday or Wednesday.
1073000	1074000	So I apologize for the delay.
1074000	1075000	But it happens.
1075000	1076000	Life gets in the way.
1076000	1080000	We're not the only podcast that sometimes gets a little slow, so sorry about that.
1080000	1085000	Always, there is our live journal and MySpace and Facebook that we like to plug as well.
1085000	1087000	MySpace, Orange Lounge Radio.
1087000	1088000	Live Journal, Orange Lounge.
1088000	1089000	And Facebook, OL Army.
1089000	1091000	Be sure to add us on those various sites.
1091000	1093000	And Twitter now as well, OLR.
1093000	1102000	And we'll get to the pre-show OLR Twit question in just a little bit when we start talking about Tokyo Game Show, which I'm sure we're going to get to during the news report.
1102000	1107000	But first, some news out of the Tokyo Game Show that I'm kind of surprised wasn't announced here in America, right, Loki?
1107000	1108000	Exactly.
1108000	1117000	I think, well, really the last US Microsoft press conference that they had was pretty much at, well, I guess I could have done one at PAX.
1117000	1128000	But it was pretty much at E3, and of course this game was rumored to have been about to be announced at E3, but for whatever reason they stopped it.
1128000	1133000	So they left it for Tokyo Game Show, and of course that game is Halo 3 Recon.
1133000	1141000	It's the one that they were teasing with the Bungie little viral video thing that they released, a brand new teaser trailer.
1141000	1147000	And Halo 3 Recon will be a standalone game, includes new multiplayer maps.
1147000	1157000	It takes place before Halo 3, and actually it's a totally different style of a game.
1157000	1166000	Of course you're not exactly one of the Spartan soldiers, so one or two hits and you're pretty much going to be dead.
1166000	1172000	And I think it sounds more of like a stealthy game since you're kind of, you know, recon.
1172000	1176000	And, I don't know, it looks kind of neat.
1176000	1180000	They announced it's going to be coming out in the fall of 2009.
1180000	1186000	That's kind of surprising because I thought it was supposed to be coming out in the spring, or at least it would have made more sense to come out in the spring, I think.
1186000	1187000	But, I don't know.
1187000	1190000	So I guess this is the next big Halo game that we're going to be getting.
1190000	1192000	Do you think it's going to do as well as Halo 3?
1192000	1193000	I don't think so.
1193000	1197000	Halo 3 was, I think it was one of those games where the hype really killed it.
1197000	1203000	I mean like Halo 3, I think if it didn't have all that hype behind it, would have been pretty well received.
1203000	1209000	But I think a lot of people grew tired of it really fast because there was so much hype around it and how it was just going to be so much better than Halo 2.
1209000	1211000	And then it was like, eh, it's Halo 2 but prettier.
1211000	1215000	I don't think this is going to do as well because I think it's running off the same engine.
1215000	1226000	And also the fact that unless you're a really big Halo fan, I don't know really if you're going to enjoy much of the prologue to the whole Halo 3 stuff.
1226000	1237000	I mean, to me, I played through Halo and I sort of know what was going on and I don't know, this doesn't seem that interesting to me.
1237000	1243000	Let me go on a side little adventure here and I want to talk about a story that somehow shockingly did not make tonight's show roll.
1243000	1245000	I just scrolled through to make sure it wouldn't come up later.
1245000	1247000	But you know, BlizzCon was also going on this week.
1247000	1252000	One of the big things that came out of BlizzCon was that Starcraft 2 is actually kind of getting split into three different games.
1252000	1260000	They're going to have like one game surrounding each of the different races inside Star Trek and that was some of the big news that hit the internet this week.
1260000	1262000	And a lot of people were like, rabble, rabble, rabble.
1262000	1270000	I can't believe they're going to make us pay three full games for, you know, it's one game for the price of three and blah, blah, I'm getting shafted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.
1270000	1275000	And I kind of look in the story about Halo 3 Recon and I'm going, well is this much different?
1275000	1280000	It is different because they've already had a full campaign for, you know, Halo 3.
1280000	1285000	This is a brand new story that takes place in, you know, a different time in the series.
1285000	1292000	Well, but Starcraft 2 is going to have that full multiplayer which is what everybody plays anyway and it's going to have a fleshed out single player story mode.
1292000	1295000	I mean, they're just kind of approaching it a different way.
1295000	1303000	Not that I'm totally defending what Blizzard's doing, but I don't see how you can say boo to that and then go, yay, another Halo 3.
1303000	1307000	I still think it's cheap though. I mean, look at like Red Alert. There's a perfect example.
1307000	1311000	The game has a few different factions and there's a storyline for each one.
1311000	1316000	Well, you know, other games have done it. They have, you know, multiple sides and they have multiple storylines.
1316000	1320000	But Halo 2's single player mode was also done like that.
1320000	1322000	So it's Halo 3.
1322000	1324000	Right, they're slightly lackluster.
1324000	1330000	The thing is, I think this should be download content. If it's going to be running off the same engine, just have it as a downloadable game, not this retail thing.
1330000	1334000	Because now if it's retail, we can charge, you know, $59.99 for it.
1334000	1339000	A lot more than you can charge for an Xbox, you know, expansion or something like that.
1339000	1342000	So, I don't know. It's just...
1342000	1351000	By the time, I guess, Halo's going to be coming out, you know, Halo 3, by the time, you know, this new game comes out, Halo 3 will probably be like $29.99.
1351000	1357000	I wouldn't be surprised if they do, like, a game of the year edition or something like that or, you know...
1357000	1359000	Eventually it'll be combined.
1359000	1360000	They're going to combine them.
1360000	1361000	Yeah, I know.
1361000	1365000	And, you know, we need one more game because, you know, what game...
1365000	1367000	We need a trilogy to complete the trilogy.
1367000	1371000	Exactly. Exactly. You know, who doesn't want three of something?
1371000	1374000	It all comes in threes, right?
1374000	1379000	I was very curious to see what our chat room would say in response to this.
1379000	1385000	The Rob D says, the difference is that there's a precedent in strategy games for putting a different campaign in for each faction.
1385000	1388000	In FPS games, there's always been an expansion pack for a new campaign.
1388000	1395000	If Halo 1 had different campaigns that were all free and Halo 2 didn't, people would be complaining about it just like they are about StarCraft.
1395000	1398000	It's not even just two purchases. It's three purchases, triple the cost.
1398000	1403000	Act F says it's basically what I said last week with the ACDC track pack.
1403000	1408000	SSJ100Matt says people are suckers, especially for Blizzard games.
1408000	1411000	And, uh, let's see, um...
1411000	1416000	It would be different if they had, like, you know, a storyline for all of them, like a campaign,
1416000	1422000	and then later on they added a new expansion that had more storyline for all the campaigns or something like that.
1422000	1424000	Break it up like that and have expansions.
1424000	1430000	I just kind of think people are passing judgement on the StarCraft 2 thing too quickly without really seeing what each individual game has to offer.
1430000	1435000	They're only looking at it at face value, going, oh, three different games? What? What?
1435000	1439000	And then I'm just going, well, how is that different from most, you know?
1439000	1443000	And Rob D brings up a good point, like FPSs have kind of done this for a long time.
1443000	1448000	Look at, uh, go back to the days of Shareware and, um, Quake.
1448000	1454000	Quake had, like, what, four different episodes? The first one was free, but you had to pay for each of the other ones individually.
1454000	1461000	But all the other four, um, or the other three campaigns that were in there were part of the retail version.
1461000	1468000	Shareware, it's just the same as saying, okay, you get one level in this demo and then you get the other ten when you buy the full game.
1468000	1473000	It's not, it's not an excuse for just adding this as its own thing.
1473000	1478000	Or, well, I'm just saying for StarCraft, that's just, I'm sorry, that's to get more money.
1478000	1482000	The whole thing is probably, oh, our game's going to be pirated to hell, so we need to sell more copies.
1482000	1485000	How do we sell more copies? We split it up into three.
1485000	1492000	Because it's not a storage issue. It's not a time issue. I can tell you right now that these are probably not going to be very fleshed out.
1492000	1497000	I mean, what can, how long can a strategy campaign last for?
1497000	1503000	I mean, not very long, so, great. Let's just do one for each specific thing.
1503000	1512000	You know, if you want to do something different, just do, like, you know, different packaging, you know, with different sides on it or something like that.
1512000	1516000	You know, collector's editions type stuff. I'm taking a wait and see approach.
1516000	1521000	I mean, you know, if games can be compared to movies, sometimes movies are released in three different parts.
1521000	1526000	And, you know, we still go see all three of them, like the Star Wars trilogy, the new one.
1526000	1530000	Matrix trilogy, even though that is questionable about its, you know, value.
1530000	1535000	But, you know, we'll pay three times to see the full movie.
1535000	1541000	But it's a full movie. It's not like I'm watching, you know, like a Batman movie.
1541000	1544000	And one of the movies is from the perspective of Batman.
1544000	1547000	Do you not think Starcraft 2 is not going to be a full game?
1547000	1552000	I don't think. Well, the way it sounds like now, I don't think each one's going to be a full game.
1552000	1560000	They're going to call them a full game, and it'll be a full campaign for one side, but it's going to feel kind of cheap because, you know, what's the other stuff?
1560000	1565000	So, say, what if I'm playing, you know, the first one and I want to play the campaign for something else?
1565000	1568000	Oh, I can't do that now. Sorry, you've got to go buy the other one.
1568000	1571000	All right, well, if you want to give us a comment on that, you can always send us an email.
1571000	1575000	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or you can call us a little later on in the program.
1575000	1581000	For now, though, we'll move on to some more gaming news, talking about 360 and some holiday bundles that are coming out.
1581000	1584000	Hooray! Free games now coming with your Xboxes.
1584000	1587000	Wait, wait, wait. This is totally new news.
1587000	1594000	I know. Never heard this one before. Well, it has been confirmed, okay, that there is now a 199 arcade holiday bundle.
1594000	1601000	And with it, you will get Sega Superstars Tennis and five Xbox Live arcade games that have not yet been announced.
1601000	1609000	Well, actually, I think the arcade games, they've been actually changing a little bit because I remember when I first bought an arcade to replace my broken system.
1609000	1611000	There was, you know, a bunch of games with it now.
1611000	1616000	I actually got a new arcade system for my sister for her birthday and it had slightly different stuff.
1616000	1627000	Like, they had Boom Boom Rocket in there, there was Pac-Man Championship Edition, Luxor 2, Feeding Frenzy, and...
1627000	1629000	A sampling. A sampling of some of the newer stuff.
1629000	1630000	I wouldn't be surprised if it's the same thing.
1630000	1636000	In fact, I would say it's exactly the same thing because for the people that don't have the bundles or haven't purchased them,
1636000	1641000	they get a disc that goes in, or they get those two free games that go in there and they put them in and then put the sticker on the box.
1641000	1649000	All right, well, if you want to jump up and get the 299 or 399 levels, that would be for the, what I just called the normal Xbox 360.
1649000	1650000	The pro and the elite.
1650000	1654000	I know it's the pro, but that's the one that most people are probably getting is the pro.
1654000	1659000	The hardcore gamer gets the elite, the person who doesn't know better and just wants the cheapest one gets the arcade.
1659000	1663000	The normal Xbox 360 is 299, or the elite for 399.
1663000	1666000	You get Lego, Indiana Jones, and Kung Fu Panda for free.
1666000	1671000	Probably those titles were selected because they're both rated E for everyone and they, you know, it's the holidays.
1671000	1672000	They're pushing the family games.
1672000	1677000	They want to push this as a family system because that's one area where the Xbox 360s always seem to lack.
1677000	1680000	And to be fair, those games are actually pretty good.
1680000	1682000	Yeah, especially the Lego one is good.
1682000	1688000	Well, even Kung Fu Panda was actually rated pretty good and it wasn't that cheap. It wasn't like a cheap movie game.
1688000	1689000	All right, well, there you have it.
1689000	1695000	Hey, one more comment on the last story because some of the, you know, because of the delay between when we say something and when it goes out to the stream on all games radio,
1695000	1699000	which is just inevitable with internet radio or even over the area radio,
1699000	1705000	reading a comment from Retertainment from the last story about Blizzard and we kind of got in that little disagreement there.
1705000	1708000	All companies want to make as much money as humanly possible.
1708000	1711000	Blizzard thinks they can make mad bucks on this deal, so they are going to go through with it.
1711000	1715000	If the community says in mass that this is not the case, they will change their plans.
1715000	1717000	But the community won't.
1717000	1718000	You know it. I know it.
1718000	1727000	Yeah, just like the community bitched and moaned, well, I should say a few individuals bitched and moaned about the Diablo 3 art style and we got a t-shirt out of it at least.
1727000	1729000	We'll see.
1729000	1737000	All right, so anyhow, yeah, so if you haven't gotten your Xbox 360 yet, you might want to wait until those package deals show up because, hey, free games!
1737000	1739000	It's hard to complain about free games. That's more than I got.
1739000	1741000	They should be out there now, I think.
1741000	1743000	That's more than I got when I got my Xbox 360.
1743000	1749000	Well, how about something that makes me super excited about the Xbox 360?
1749000	1752000	Barbie Horse Princess, part 2.
1752000	1754000	They're making a babysitting game in there?
1754000	1759000	To quote Patty from Twitter earlier, Diana Né Pompeire.
1759000	1761000	No.
1761000	1766000	Tekken 6 is going to be out on the Xbox 360 in Fall 2009.
1766000	1769000	That makes me super happy.
1769000	1770000	Super, super happy.
1770000	1773000	Because then I don't have to get it on PlayStation 3.
1773000	1777000	But, I don't know, I might get it on PlayStation 3, but I love Tekken.
1777000	1784000	I am the world's biggest Tekken fangirl, and according to Microsoft, it's going to be out on Fall 2009.
1784000	1789000	You know, and I don't know if it was ever announced that it was an exclusive, but that's one less exclusive that they get.
1789000	1804000	It was considered to be before PS3 exclusive, especially given that one of the demos for the PlayStation 3 was actually renderings of Jin from the Tekken series.
1804000	1812000	So, this was actually confirmed at the pre-Tokyo Game Show 2008 press conference for Namco Bandai.
1812000	1818000	I'm kind of curious, as a Tekken fangirl, how you feel about this announcement about Tekken going by.
1818000	1821000	And by by, I mean, of course, by system all.
1821000	1824000	Because, you know, I had another friend of mine who was pretty into Tekken who was like,
1824000	1828000	wow, that is big news for Tekken to not come out on a Sony system only.
1828000	1829000	That's huge.
1829000	1831000	No, it is. I agree.
1831000	1841000	In fact, in the past, as far as I'm aware, every American Tekken release has been out on a Sony system.
1841000	1849000	There has been a Tekken card fighter game that came out in Japan on Wonderswan.
1849000	1852000	But then again, that's Bandai's system.
1852000	1853000	We don't count the spin-offs.
1853000	1857000	Then we'd have to count Death by Degrees and no one wants to remember that game.
1857000	1864000	But then again, that's also in the Tekken franchise and it did only come out for PlayStation 2, right?
1864000	1865000	True.
1865000	1873000	So I do believe, if I'm correct, there's only ever been one Tekken game that came out on a non-Sony system.
1873000	1874000	And that was the Wonderswan.
1874000	1879000	But then again, a lot of Sony franchises did come out on the Wonderswan.
1879000	1890000	So for them to give that much of a nod to the Xbox 360, I think is very, very big.
1890000	1892000	Some of the chatters just want to throw this out there.
1892000	1896000	AlphaKananagram and Hitstun want to remind you, there was Tekken Advance on Game Boy Advance.
1896000	1899000	That's right. That was the other one I was trying to think of. I actually do have that one too.
1899000	1908000	So out of, let's see, five games tagged tournament, there were only two other games that came out.
1908000	1909000	Dark Resurrection came out on-
1909000	1914000	And they weren't, I mean, with all due respect, these other two games weren't real Tekken games, quote-unquote.
1914000	1920000	These other ones we're thinking of are arcade, ports, the base Tekken series.
1920000	1921000	We don't count these other ones.
1921000	1927000	Dark Resurrection, though, was an actual Tekken game, but that came out on PSP.
1927000	1929000	I was going to read a comment from chat.
1929000	1934000	Tigerclaw on chat says, you know, Namco has pretty much slapped Sony in the face by becoming multiplatform.
1934000	1938000	Tekken has been a PlayStation exclusive since day one.
1938000	1941000	That pretty much was it.
1941000	1950000	Especially when you had all your PlayStation releases have the compatibility with each other to go back and look at your movies and everything.
1950000	1958000	I just, I really do think that it's a really big deal.
1958000	1966000	On top of that, I think it's also going to be, I'm not calling it a nail in the coffin for Sony,
1966000	1973000	but I think it's definitely a major wake-up call that they're not doing something right.
1973000	1976000	They had been doing right when the PlayStation came out.
1976000	1979000	They had been doing right when the PS2 came out. Am I right?
1979000	1982000	Absolutely. Those are both fantastic systems.
1982000	1988000	As far as their sales went, their marketing strategy, as far as them coming out over the top of the competition,
1988000	1994000	and now they're sliding, now they're falling into, sorry, they're falling into the Sega Pit.
1994000	1999000	Well, it's interesting, though, because here in America, you know, that's kind of the general perception.
1999000	2005000	I mean, granted, there's Sony fanboys, there's my, you know, every console will always have its fanboys until the end of time.
2005000	2010000	However, but in Japan, I'm kind of looking at this and going, is this really going to make a difference in Japan?
2010000	2014000	I mean, I don't see this moving Xbox 360s in Japan suddenly.
2014000	2021000	I just don't see this, you know, in my mind, this is more of a, hey, let's get Tekken 6 to more people in America.
2021000	2025000	I don't think this is going to mean a hill of beans in Japan. I think most people will still get it for PS3.
2025000	2028000	Keep in mind, though, the Saturn did very well in Japan.
2028000	2029000	True.
2029000	2034000	And the Saturn did not do well over here because of marketing.
2034000	2037000	They didn't bring out the games that the fans were interested in.
2037000	2040000	They didn't market the system properly.
2040000	2042000	And now that's happening with the PS3 over here.
2042000	2045000	They're basically pulling a Sega.
2045000	2049000	They're trying to rest on, oh, well, we had this system back in the day.
2049000	2051000	Yeah, but what do you have now?
2051000	2053000	The Dreamcast was fantastic, don't get me wrong.
2053000	2056000	The Saturn to this day is one of my favorite gaming systems.
2056000	2059000	But did they have the right support over here?
2059000	2060000	No.
2060000	2062000	And what's happening to the PlayStation 3 now?
2062000	2063000	It's losing its support.
2063000	2065000	They're not doing something right.
2065000	2069000	Well, the PlayStation 3 is always going to be a Blu-ray player that plays games.
2069000	2071000	That's what I agree.
2071000	2073000	This will not put Sony out of business.
2073000	2076000	There will be a PS4, but we just kind of hope they, you know...
2076000	2085000	If they do a PS4, I think the PS4, they're going to have to turn some shit around before they can actually make it anything that's viable for their company to bring out.
2085000	2088000	Else they're just going to have to go back to making TVs.
2088000	2089000	All right.
2089000	2092000	We're getting a little too much into the whole console war now.
2092000	2096000	And yes, GS68 bless you for SEGA Sanchiro.
2096000	2100000	SEGA Sanchiro was awesome.
2100000	2105000	Let's move on. Let's go back to some more gaming news that I think will also make a lot of folks happy.
2105000	2111000	Yeah. Well, you know, of course there are many games coming to both consoles out there.
2111000	2123000	But one date that they did announce was the release of the brand new Resident Evil 5 that will be coming to consoles March 12th.
2123000	2127000	And, of course, that will be coming to the 360 and on the PS3.
2127000	2131000	And it's all sorts of awesome.
2131000	2135000	It's like Resident Evil 4 HD.
2135000	2141000	I don't know. This game looks freaking sweet to me. I'm excited about Resident Evil 5.
2141000	2143000	And I barely even played Resident Evil 4.
2143000	2147000	Well, no, I actually spent quite a bit of time on Resident Evil 4. It was a tremendous game.
2147000	2151000	But I'm just excited about the whole, like, you know, high def and scary scary and all that good stuff.
2151000	2154000	It's pretty good. And now they have co-op, so that's awesome.
2154000	2159000	Well, another sequel that's making a lot of people go, huh, is 99 Nights 2.
2159000	2164000	That's right. It was confirmed at the Tokyo Game Show that 99 Nights 2 is coming to the Xbox 360.
2164000	2169000	But as far as when and how much and what's new about it, nope, no information on that yet.
2169000	2172000	Just the fact it is coming.
2172000	2177000	I know a lot of people like to hate on 99 Nights. I didn't think the game was awful.
2177000	2180000	Like, it's kind of how I feel about Beat and Groovy in some ways.
2180000	2185000	No, actually, I don't know. I have that same feeling of 99 Nights, there's a good game in there somewhere,
2185000	2188000	but there were just a few flaws that kind of kept it from being great.
2188000	2191000	Well, look at, like, Dynasty Warriors. Why does that game sell?
2191000	2198000	I mean, they literally, seriously, they put out three different versions of pretty much the same game
2198000	2200000	each time that there's a new release.
2200000	2206000	You have Dynasty Warriors, Dynasty Warriors Empires, and Dynasty Warriors,
2206000	2210000	God, I remember the XL or something like that, Extreme Legends.
2210000	2214000	And they're all practically the same.
2214000	2220000	I mean, I don't really play the series too much, but your average consumer is going to look at all three of those
2220000	2223000	and go, I don't get it. What's the difference?
2223000	2228000	And really, that's kind of like, with this game, it's basically like a Dynasty Warriors clone,
2228000	2233000	so the next one comes out, I'm not expecting they're going to change much, hopefully fix some things, and that's it.
2233000	2237000	Well, you know, they only need to fix a few more things for this game to actually be pretty kick-ass.
2237000	2239000	I enjoy myself. I like the game.
2239000	2242000	Rama says, Sky, don't you have 99 Nights? I do. I bought it the day it came out.
2242000	2246000	But I'm also, you have to remember, I'm also a whore for Q Entertainment.
2246000	2252000	I mean, seriously, anything Mizuguchi does, I'm going to buy, because he's one of my favorite game designers,
2252000	2256000	except Gun Pay. I never got Gun Pay for some reason, but it's on my list.
2256000	2260000	Can you imagine how awesome Beat and Groovy would have been if Q Entertainment had made it?
2260000	2265000	I think Q Entertainment should make a game done right, anyway.
2265000	2267000	Anyway, that's for another day.
2267000	2273000	But 99 Nights, you know, obviously 99 Nights, as much as I want to say, it's not as bad as you all think.
2273000	2277000	Okay, definitely the game had its flaws. It did get boring after a while.
2277000	2279000	I just hope they can fix some of it with 99 Nights, too.
2279000	2283000	There's a good game in there somewhere, and I hope people don't totally pass it off on name alone,
2283000	2287000	because, hey, sometimes games don't get really, really good until the sequel.
2287000	2290000	For instance, Mega Man.
2290000	2293000	A lot of people don't remember Mega Man until Mega Man 2.
2293000	2298000	It's not to say the first Mega Man was bad. It was just, you know, just needed a few tweaks,
2298000	2300000	and then Mega Man 2 was awesome.
2300000	2303000	Of course, then again, I wouldn't even compare Mega Man to 99 Nights,
2303000	2305000	so I don't know where the fuck I'm going with that analogy.
2305000	2307000	So why don't we go on to the next story?
2307000	2309000	I don't know where the fuck you're going with that analogy, Rob.
2309000	2310000	I don't either. I'm obviously drunk.
2310000	2312000	So how about something else?
2312000	2313000	How about it?
2313000	2321000	Well, you know there had been some rumors about there potentially being a Blu-ray drive on the Xbox 360?
2321000	2324000	Every week there's some damn rumor about it, yes.
2324000	2327000	Well, here is the official word.
2327000	2328000	Dun dun dun.
2328000	2333000	This is a quote from one of Microsoft's representatives.
2333000	2334000	It says,
2334000	2340000	As we've said before, Microsoft has no plans to introduce an Xbox 360 Blu-ray add-on.
2340000	2343000	Games are what drive consumers to purchase game consoles,
2343000	2348000	and we remain focused on providing the largest library of blockbuster games available.
2348000	2350000	And that's a direct quote.
2350000	2354000	Allow me to translate to all the bloggers around America and throughout the world, really.
2354000	2355000	I want to provide my translation.
2355000	2356000	Oh, please. Go ahead.
2356000	2357000	Shut the fuck up!
2357000	2359000	That's exactly what I was going to say.
2359000	2362000	Shut the fuck up about the Blu-ray on Microsoft.
2362000	2364000	It is not happening.
2364000	2368000	And if it is going to happen, we'll fucking tell you a long time from now,
2368000	2370000	because it's just not something we're interested in right now.
2370000	2375000	The whole thing that brought that up was that there had been a rumor that Microsoft had commissioned
2375000	2379000	the hardware to be made with a Toshiba Samsung.
2379000	2381000	But, no.
2381000	2382000	And you want to know what?
2382000	2385000	I love my HD DVD player on it.
2385000	2391000	But, going back to what I was previously saying about what Sony is doing wrong,
2391000	2394000	I think that's what Sony's doing wrong.
2394000	2399000	They're not focusing on the games, and that's what Microsoft is doing right.
2399000	2401000	Well, but is that necessarily a bad thing?
2401000	2405000	Because I look at the PSP and I go, eh, not my favorite gaming system first,
2405000	2409000	but the PSP does a lot of cool shit that I like.
2409000	2410000	It's kind of like an all-in-one little device.
2410000	2414000	I can name people off the top of my head who've bought the PSP not as a gaming system,
2414000	2415000	but as a multimedia system.
2415000	2416000	Exactly.
2416000	2420000	But when I think handheld game system, I think of my DS.
2420000	2426000	But what's so wrong with the PlayStation 3 taking that same kind of concept about being a home entertainment device?
2426000	2432000	Because when someone's going to buy a console, it is going to be because they can play games on it.
2432000	2437000	That is, I think, the end all of what a video game console is.
2437000	2440000	It can have all these nice pretty special bells and whistles,
2440000	2445000	but in the end, no matter what, what do we always say?
2445000	2448000	The console is only as good as the games that are on it.
2448000	2454000	If they're not putting good games on it, what good is the damn console other than, you know, just playing a movie?
2454000	2459000	I know somebody who owns a PlayStation 3 for nothing but Blu-ray.
2459000	2463000	They don't own a single video game, just the Blu-ray player, because it's a cheap Blu-ray player.
2463000	2466000	So it's like, what's the point?
2466000	2469000	You can buy Blu-ray players.
2469000	2471000	One other thing I kind of want to point out, you know,
2471000	2477000	Microsoft has a high-definition movie download service, and they're rolling out Netflix pretty soon.
2477000	2480000	Do they really want a Blu-ray player? Probably not.
2480000	2484000	They probably want to go to this whole digital distribution thing, because there's a lot of money to be made there.
2484000	2491000	I think that's where it's going. I really do think that that's the future of our media, you know.
2491000	2496000	In fact, I wouldn't be surprised that ten years down the line, you'll have a hard time picking up physical media.
2496000	2499000	It's all going to be downloadable content.
2499000	2505000	All right, well, there you have it. No Blu-ray, so you just stop spreading rumors about it. Shut up. Please.
2505000	2511000	Meantime, though, we've got a lot of other releases coming out that are confirmed and will be happening, right, Loki?
2511000	2515000	Yes, there's plenty of stuff coming out, because we're now in the fourth quarter,
2515000	2519000	which is where all the game companies like to hide their games.
2519000	2523000	And starting off, and of course there's a lot of crap out there,
2523000	2528000	Army Men, Soldiers of Misfortune for the Wii looks like a piece of shit,
2528000	2532000	and Avatar The Last... Please, tell us how you really feel.
2532000	2537000	Well, okay, let me put it this way. It's by a company called Zoo Games, and all their games have sucked.
2537000	2541000	Avatar The Last Airbender Into the Inferno.
2541000	2547000	Hopefully the achievements take a little longer to get than, say, the last game where you could get them all in about five minutes.
2547000	2552000	And that'll be out on the Wii, PlayStation 2, and Xbox 360.
2552000	2556000	Blitz League 2 coming out on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.
2556000	2562000	TAC The Guardians of Gross on the Wii and PlayStation 2.
2562000	2567000	And of course another TAC game for the DS, Mojo Mistake.
2567000	2574000	Bratz Girls Really Rock coming to the Wii and DS and PlayStation 2.
2574000	2583000	We've got, let's see, Pray the Stars, which apparently didn't come out last week.
2583000	2586000	That is on the DS.
2586000	2592000	Rob Dine, that's available on all platforms.
2592000	2600000	Resuscitate the Radio Host. I'm okay, I just drank... Oh god, no, I'm gonna choke again.
2600000	2604000	Shitty radio, keep reading dates.
2604000	2608000	Littlest Pet Shop. They are putting out a ton of these because apparently they think they are Nintendogs.
2608000	2613000	Littlest Pet Shop Winter, Littlest Pet Shop Garden, and Littlest Pet Shop.
2613000	2617000	I know there's one more. Those are all coming out.
2617000	2620000	The Littlest Pet Shop on the Wii and the rest on the DS.
2620000	2627000	Poker for Dummies on PC. Brain Training for Dummies on PC.
2627000	2632000	My Japanese Coach on DS. That's one I'm actually looking forward to checking out.
2632000	2637000	And let's see, SOCOM Confrontation coming out this week.
2637000	2643000	You can get that by itself and with the headset or download it on the PlayStation Network.
2643000	2650000	Saints Row 2 is coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Highly recommend checking that out.
2650000	2657000	Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer on the DS, if you happen to own a dog.
2657000	2660000	And you like to talk to dogs.
2660000	2663000	I like to talk to dogs. Get off me, dog!
2663000	2665000	Do they talk back?
2665000	2669000	Only when I'm high.
2669000	2676000	Penny Racer's Party Turbo Q Speedway, that's the localization of Qoro Q.
2676000	2680000	Wait, what? That's a Qoro Q game?
2680000	2681000	Yes, it's a Qoro Q game.
2681000	2683000	Sweet!
2683000	2688000	Tenpin Alley 2 coming out on the Wii. Another bowling game.

2698000	2702000	Golden Axe Beast Rider on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
2702000	2708000	Oh, and Rock Revolution will be coming out also, I believe the game only version, on all platforms except for the Wii.
2708000	2712000	I don't know why the Wii got delayed. Probably not done yet, making a crappy game.
2712000	2718000	Dokapon Kingdom on Wii and PlayStation 2, the party game where you're supposed to lose your friends.
2718000	2722000	And FIFA Soccer 09 is coming out on all platforms.
2722000	2726000	Sam & Max Season 1 finally coming out on the Wii.
2726000	2728000	A little late there.
2728000	2730000	Dead Space coming out on PlayStation 2.
2730000	2735000	Yeah, but it's a way to expose it to a whole new audience that probably missed it on the PC.
2735000	2742000	Dead Space coming out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2742000	2744000	Lots of stuff.
2744000	2748000	I actually think I want to get Rock Revolution. I don't know why.
2748000	2758000	I don't know, I feel like after buying Beat & Groovy this week, I just need to kind of complete my Konami the year the music games died for us trifecta.
2758000	2761000	Save your money, please.
2761000	2762000	I don't know.
2762000	2764000	Please, I urge you.
2764000	2766000	I think I'm going to get it.
2766000	2771000	One of us has to do it. For the sake of reporting on it for the show, someone's got to take the plunge.
2771000	2775000	I will take care of the game, but please.
2775000	2780000	Anyways, Safecracker coming to the Wii.
2780000	2784000	Let's see here, Hot Dish for PC.
2784000	2786000	Well, Hot Dish!
2786000	2790000	SpongeBob SquarePants, The Game of Life for the PC.
2790000	2793000	Wow, digging at the bottom of the barrel here.
2793000	2796000	Enchanted Fairy Friends, Secret Fairy.
2796000	2802000	And, damn, there's still more stuff coming out.
2802000	2806000	Cake Mania, Baker's Challenge on PSP.
2806000	2808000	World of Goo coming out on PC.
2808000	2812000	Not one person who listens to this show gives a shit about Cake Mania on the PSP.
2812000	2815000	Hey, it's a casual game, okay? Seriously.
2815000	2819000	It's popular, it's online, and then finally this might be a game you're interested in.
2819000	2821000	Rock Band 2 coming out.
2821000	2826000	Both the special edition bundles on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and the game only on PlayStation 3.
2826000	2827000	There we go.
2827000	2828000	A week from today.
2828000	2829000	There we go.
2829000	2830000	Saving the best for last.
2830000	2833000	And that is your gaming week.
2833000	2835000	How about Japan?
2835000	2836000	How about them?
2836000	2839000	How about them? How you doing over in Japan?
2839000	2843000	Xbox 360, you have Facebreaker to look forward to this week on the 16th.
2843000	2846000	That's that boxing game that looks kind of funny, right?
2846000	2848000	I don't know much about this game.
2848000	2850000	I saw it a little bit at Petty Arcade Expo, that was about it.
2850000	2851000	It's like Ready to Rumble.
2851000	2852000	Okay.
2852000	2856000	You're also getting it on the PlayStation 3, Facebreaker this week, and that's pretty much your big titles.
2856000	2859000	That's really your only big title on the current systems.
2859000	2865000	However, the Wii gets a whole load of crap this week, including Wii Music makes its way out this week.
2865000	2866000	Oh boy.
2866000	2867000	The music doesn't stop there.
2867000	2871000	You also get the Guitar Hero games are finally making their way to the Wii this week in Japan.
2871000	2877000	Legends of Rock, that's Guitar Hero 3, as well as Aerosmith, and a bundle for Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
2877000	2882000	I believe that is, again, just like last week on the other systems, that's Guitar Hero 3 by itself,
2882000	2885000	because I think the bundle was all they had for a while.
2885000	2886000	So there you go.
2886000	2890000	Also, a game called Skycrawlers, coming out from Namco Bandai,
2890000	2896000	and Daikaiju Battle, Ultra Colosseum, coming out also from Bandai Namco on the Wii.
2896000	2897000	That's big monsters.
2897000	2899000	Ah, very cool.
2899000	2902000	Well, there you go. So a pretty big week for the Wii over in Japan.
2902000	2906000	If you want to head over to last gen, Arcana Heart gets a price reduction.
2906000	2908000	It's moving into the best series.
2908000	2912000	And Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam Meisters, comes out this week as well.
2912000	2916000	And now we're going to move over to the handhelds and take a look at what's coming out of the Nintendo DS.
2916000	2919000	Yadaman 2 DS comes out this week.
2919000	2921000	Coldsept DS, that should be fun.
2921000	2923000	I like Coldsept on the 360.
2923000	2931000	Away, Shuffle Dungeon, also this week, and Nazo Nazo and Quiz Ichi Kotei Jikan Kyumate comes out as well from Konami this week.
2931000	2933000	Sounds like some type of quiz little show there.
2933000	2940000	Coming out on some of the Sony handheld system, that would be the PSP.
2940000	2944000	It looks like just a bunch of accessories.
2944000	2946000	I think they're getting some new bundles this week.
2946000	2950000	They have a new Slim coming out in Pearl White and Piano Black.
2950000	2952000	And with that comes a whole bunch of other new accessories.
2952000	2954000	I think that's the PSP 3000.
2954000	2958000	Oh yeah, that is. It's the new redo of the PSP.
2958000	2961000	Comes out this week, so some of you might be actually importing that.
2961000	2969000	And if you're not, well, you can look forward to Yusha no Kusei ni Namakida or 2 comes out this week in Japan.
2969000	2971000	And that is a first person title.
2971000	2975000	And it looks like some type of puzzle game.
2975000	2981000	I think that's the one that's also supposed to be on the PlayStation Network at the same time.
2981000	2983000	He said that's a first person game. That's like a reverse.
2983000	2985000	Oh sorry, first party game.
2985000	2990000	That was like a reverse of what they did with Conduit.
2990000	2992000	Alright, so there you go, your Japanese release dates.
2992000	2997000	Let's head over to the other pond across the Atlantic this time.
2997000	3001000	Well, on the 13th comes Equestrian Training on the DS.
3001000	3005000	That would be, I think that's today now over there, so oops.
3005000	3010000	On the 17th, Golden Axe Beast Rider on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3010000	3014000	Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 on Damn Near Everything.
3014000	3019000	Rapala Fishing Frenzy, whatever, on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3019000	3023000	Saints Row 2 for PlayStation 3 PC and Xbox 360.
3023000	3026000	And What's Cooking with Jamie Oliver on DS.
3026000	3029000	So, that would be it.
3029000	3031000	I think that's coming out here in a few weeks too.
3031000	3035000	I have absolutely zero interest in that, because you know what?
3035000	3039000	I have a kitchen, and I have food, and I know how to cook.
3039000	3041000	I have Iron Chef.
3041000	3043000	I have the Iron Chef book, and it's awesome.
3043000	3044000	That little red book?
3044000	3045000	Yeah.
3045000	3046000	Isn't that great?
3046000	3049000	I want to actually try making the Home Bar Lobster dish that was in there.
3049000	3055000	Anyways, enough about Iron Chef, but if we are going to talk about Iron Chef.
3055000	3059000	The secret ingredient is more skins for Little Big Planet.
3059000	3063000	And GameStop is sweetening the deal with their pre-orders.
3063000	3072000	Before you could get your Kratos skin on, or at least see different parts of it to create your own Kratos Sackboy.
3072000	3075000	But now you'll be getting also a Medusa.
3075000	3077000	Looks like a skin set there.
3077000	3081000	And costumes for, looks like a minotaur.
3081000	3083000	So that's pretty awesome.
3083000	3088000	And those will be available when the game is released a couple weeks from now.
3088000	3090000	So that's pretty sweet.
3090000	3093000	And then, of course, Tokyo Game Show.
3093000	3097000	They were showing off a few more things.
3097000	3101000	Skins for Solid Snake from, of course, Metal Gear Solid.
3101000	3107000	And from Final Fantasy VII, they have Sephiroth.
3107000	3109000	Oh joy.
3109000	3111000	No cloud, though. I don't understand why.
3111000	3112000	How are you going to have a battle?
3112000	3113000	Oh my god, you know what that means.
3113000	3115000	There's going to be a Final Fantasy VII remake on PlayStation 3.
3115000	3117000	This is proof.
3117000	3120000	And it's going to be done with Sackboys.
3120000	3123000	It's like Potter Puppet Pals, but for the next gen.
3123000	3126000	Dude, that would be the best game ever.
3126000	3128000	That actually would be kind of awesome.
3128000	3130000	Final Fantasy Puppet Pals. The game.
3130000	3132000	Very, very awesome.
3132000	3133000	Cool, cool.
3133000	3136000	Do you have your little big planet pre-ordered? Are you getting this, Loki?
3136000	3137000	Yes, I am.
3137000	3138000	All right.
3138000	3140000	Redertainment in chat's kind of pissed.
3140000	3142000	He says, Sephiroth? No cloud? What the fuck?
3142000	3144000	Give it time. That's all I know.
3144000	3145000	Cloud will be later.
3145000	3149000	Cloud comes with your Final Fantasy VII remake pre-ordered. Duh.
3149000	3151000	Hello?
3151000	3154000	By the way, speaking of little big planets, some other news.
3154000	3157000	There was a little bit of, will they, won't they, with the beta?
3157000	3160000	And will the levels made in the beta be playable in the final game?
3160000	3162000	And the answer is...
3162000	3163000	Unicron.
3163000	3165000	No, the answer is yes.
3165000	3170000	And it was confirmed to 1UP because they're able to get confirmations from big developers.
3170000	3175000	That indeed, the things that people have been making in the beta, they will transfer over to the final game.
3175000	3182000	Apparently, though, they're kind of gauging how people feel about this news on the official PlayStation forums.
3182000	3183000	So they might change their mind.
3183000	3185000	Why would you not like this idea, huh?
3185000	3188000	Because they want everybody to start on the same page.
3188000	3189000	That's dumb.
3189000	3192000	You don't have access to all the same stuff in the beta, right?
3192000	3196000	Yeah, I'd say it's win-win because you start the game, there's a ton of fucking content to download.
3196000	3197000	Exactly.
3197000	3199000	Why would that be bad? That's good.
3199000	3201000	Now I can play Bobby's level.
3201000	3205000	Bobby Blackwolf, of course, is the man who does the show before us here on All Games Radio.
3205000	3207000	He actually made a little level that's cute.
3207000	3211000	It's like the quest, because there's a YouTube of it somewhere if you look up his YouTube account.
3211000	3213000	It's like the quest to get a beta code.
3213000	3214000	And it's funny.
3214000	3216000	It's cute. It kind of shows what you can do with the game.
3216000	3220000	Because, you know, we had that little demo at Penny Arcade Expo and kind of got to play the game.
3220000	3222000	We didn't get to see a lot of the editor.
3222000	3224000	We really didn't get to see a lot about editing the levels.
3224000	3226000	And it was kind of cool to see what you can really create.
3226000	3229000	I don't know how much time he spent on that, but I imagine it wasn't that much.
3230000	3232000	I hope the Wall of Awesome level's in there.
3232000	3234000	With my picture on it.
3234000	3235000	What level's...what?
3235000	3239000	Remember? Because I beat the developer at that little mini-game thing that he did.
3239000	3240000	Oh yeah, okay.
3240000	3241000	So I got a picture on the Wall of Awesome.
3241000	3242000	Oh, maybe.
3242000	3245000	But maybe that was just for Penny Arcade Expo. Who knows?
3245000	3247000	Yeah. Perhaps.
3247000	3248000	Awesome.
3248000	3250000	Well, there you go.
3250000	3251000	We'll be looking for that.
3251000	3254000	I'm finally going to have to crack and buy a PlayStation 3 in a couple weeks, finally, I think.
3254000	3256000	Because I do want this game.
3259000	3261000	I was just thinking about that, actually.
3261000	3262000	How so?
3262000	3264000	You know, that was for SingStar, right?
3264000	3266000	No, no. For LittleBigPlanet.
3266000	3268000	I mean, I don't know why I said that.
3268000	3270000	I was thinking about SingStar, though.
3270000	3272000	Because I've also...okay, because I've also talked about...
3272000	3273000	Because you wanted the ABBA.
3273000	3275000	Right, because I wanted SingStar ABBA.
3275000	3280000	My brain was doing that thing where it jumps topics without me actually saying anything about it.
3280000	3282000	No, it's fine. I have said that before.
3282000	3284000	But I was thinking about that.
3284000	3287000	Are those the only two games that you're interested in to get the system?
3289000	3291000	For right now, but I'm also interested in Home.
3291000	3293000	I think Home's going to be kind of cool.
3293000	3296000	And, you know, we'll see what kind of comes up next year.
3296000	3299000	I mean, I was just wondering if that would really be your only two reasons.
3302000	3304000	And the fact that it's a Blu-ray player. I can benefit from that, too.
3304000	3305000	Yeah.
3305000	3307000	There's enough for me.
3307000	3310000	Well, we've been discussing the PSP earlier.
3310000	3313000	Well, here's something that we finally have a confirmation on.
3313000	3316000	Yoshida Shuhei has said it himself.
3316000	3320000	That Gran Turismo PSP is in development.
3320000	3327000	But it's...there's actually no real date on it yet.
3327000	3332000	In fact, according to this article, when he was asked about it, he actually said,
3332000	3333000	Good question.
3333000	3337000	It's in Polyphony Digital and they're working on it.
3337000	3341000	So, at any rate, they say that the reason that it's been delayed
3341000	3345000	is because Polyphony's been working on other projects,
3345000	3349000	but they have been working on Gran Turismo 5 Prolog
3349000	3351000	and Gran Turismo 5 for PS3,
3351000	3359000	so they were actually working on the PS3 as their priority,
3359000	3361000	and not the PSP one.
3361000	3365000	But when he was asked when it would be, he said,
3365000	3367000	No comment.
3367000	3372000	That's a lame excuse, I think, because this has been in development
3372000	3375000	since before the PSP was released.
3375000	3377000	So come on, man. Seriously.
3377000	3380000	It's been in development for a long time now.
3380000	3382000	It'll be out when Duke Nukem Forever is out.
3382000	3384000	They have to make the graphics extra pretty, remember?
3384000	3386000	Oh, my ass.
3386000	3387000	It's just like they were saying,
3387000	3392000	Oh, well, we don't know how to make the cars take damage and stuff,
3392000	3398000	and the car manufacturers don't want us to dirty up their cars and stuff yet.
3398000	3403000	Other games have the same licensed cars and realistic damage modeling.
3403000	3406000	Excuses, excuses, excuses.
3406000	3407000	And you know what?
3407000	3410000	By the time your stupid game is released, no one will care.
3410000	3412000	The end.
3412000	3414000	The end.
3414000	3417000	But one thing you can do in the meantime with your PSP,
3417000	3420000	since you won't be playing Gran Turismo on it,
3420000	3422000	is you can use it as a secondary monitor.
3422000	3425000	Thanks to the homebrew community, they have released an app,
3425000	3428000	and I know there's another one out there that's also part of something else
3428000	3430000	that can do the same thing, but
3430000	3438000	PSP DISP version 0.1 allows you to connect your PSP to your PC via the USB cable
3438000	3440000	and use it as a secondary monitor.
3440000	3443000	It's able to display graphics.
3443000	3445000	The hell would you fit on it?
3445000	3448000	Graphics of 960x544.
3448000	3452000	It's just you have to kind of pan the image around.
3452000	3457000	But you can do that, and it's supported, of course, only on the custom firmwares.
3457000	3458000	Of course.
3458000	3461000	4.01 M33 and above.
3461000	3465000	So wait, while I have World of Warcraft going on my main computer screen,
3465000	3468000	I can have WoW head up in a browser window on my secondary screen?
3468000	3469000	Yes.
3469000	3471000	That's kind of neat.
3471000	3472000	Yeah.
3472000	3475000	So, I mean, it's cheap.
3475000	3478000	It's good for, like, you know, visualizations or whatever,
3478000	3482000	or if you're working on something and you want to view something on your other screen.
3482000	3485000	Or what if you're designing a PSP website?
3485000	3487000	That doesn't work.
3487000	3488000	Don't!
3488000	3489000	No.
3489000	3491000	PSP doesn't display stuff quite like...
3491000	3493000	You see what I was trying to get at, though.
3493000	3494000	I see what you're trying to get at, yeah.
3494000	3496000	You've designed the lovely olrpsp.com,
3496000	3498000	which includes the all-games radio player,
3498000	3500000	so you can listen to us on your PSP live on Sunday nights.
3500000	3505000	Yeah, unfortunately the PSP does not display stuff the same as your PC,
3505000	3509000	and it makes it kind of difficult because you have to constantly tweak stuff
3509000	3512000	and then refresh, tweak stuff, refresh.
3512000	3513000	Yeah.
3513000	3514000	All right.
3514000	3518000	Well, look, one thing that you're going to be able to enjoy a lot more on your PSP,
3518000	3520000	and it doesn't even have to run custom firmware,
3520000	3522000	LocoRoco 2!
3522000	3526000	Come on, you knew it was coming because Sony really hyped up the first LocoRoco game.
3526000	3527000	You knew it was coming.
3527000	3528000	You know what's kind of interesting, though?
3528000	3531000	The game has also been confirmed for Europe as well as Japan, obviously.
3531000	3532000	We all know it's going there.
3532000	3537000	But the thing is that actually the game is going to be coming out first in Europe.
3537000	3539000	The game is coming out in November.
3539000	3541000	That's right, November in Europe,
3541000	3545000	and no date announced yet for Japan as far as I know.
3545000	3547000	I believe it might be early next year.
3547000	3551000	So those of you folks over in Europe that always complain you get the shaft,
3551000	3553000	Sony loves you!
3553000	3555000	They're giving you LocoRoco 2 first.
3555000	3557000	There you go.
3557000	3559000	LocoRoco is awesome.
3559000	3562000	No word about the American release, though.
3562000	3563000	Which is kind of sad-ish.
3563000	3564000	We'd better get it.
3564000	3567000	I would think that it would do so much better here than it did there.
3567000	3568000	The question is when.
3568000	3569000	Will we have to wait until last?
3569000	3570000	Will we be in between?
3570000	3572000	Well, LocoRoco came out here last time.
3572000	3574000	Oh, wait, no, that's Patapon.
3574000	3575000	Never mind.
3575000	3576000	Which is also getting a sequel.
3576000	3578000	That's what ActDeaf just said in chat.
3578000	3579000	chat.net.org.com.
3579000	3580000	Patapon 2 is also coming.
3580000	3581000	Yes.
3581000	3582000	Pwn, pwn, patapon.
3582000	3583000	Patapon.
3583000	3586000	Well, our next bit of news makes me super happy.
3586000	3590000	That is, if it doesn't suck as much as some of the other later releases did.
3590000	3594000	But there's going to be a new Castlevania game on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3594000	3597000	And it's...
3597000	3602000	They actually showed about ten seconds of footage of it.
3602000	3604000	And no gameplay.
3604000	3605000	It was nothing.
3605000	3607000	It's being produced by Igarashi.
3607000	3609000	And, you know, he's my hero and I got to meet him.
3609000	3611000	It made me so happy.
3611000	3613000	So maybe it's going to be good.
3613000	3621000	I'm actually more excited about the other one that's coming out on the handheld.
3621000	3623000	Oh, yeah, Order of Othello.
3623000	3624000	Order of Othello, yeah.
3624000	3625000	Oh, yeah.
3625000	3629000	Igarashi and Igaraki should get together and form a death metal band.
3629000	3630000	I think it would be awesome.
3630000	3632000	Don't you think?
3632000	3634000	Igarashi and Igarashi?
3634000	3637000	Yes, Igarashi and Igaraki should get together.
3637000	3639000	The Dead or Alive guy and the Castlevania guy should get together and form a death metal band.
3639000	3640000	Dude, he's such a rockstar.
3640000	3642000	He's on the picture here.
3642000	3646000	Wearing a leather cowboy hat and holding a whip.
3646000	3648000	And I'm like, dude, you're hot.
3648000	3650000	And then Mizuguchi can play keyboards.
3650000	3653000	And then who would be the singer?
3653000	3654000	What game designer would be the singer for that band?
3654000	3656000	Posting the picture in the chatroom.
3656000	3658000	Because, dude, I'm sorry.
3658000	3660000	He looks like a freaking rockstar.
3660000	3663000	He is a freaking rockstar.
3663000	3664000	That's why I'm thinking.
3664000	3666000	Yes, and DarkTessuya says, and do a game.
3666000	3668000	They should all come together and do a game.
3668000	3670000	I would die of, I would have a fan-gasm right there.
3670000	3673000	I don't know, but they would never agree.
3673000	3675000	They would kill each other first.
3675000	3679000	I bet if you gave them both the same premise of the game,
3679000	3684000	we'd get something fucked up from both of them, but in different ways.
3684000	3688000	TheRobD says Miyamoto would be the conductor.
3688000	3691000	Inafume is the singer.
3691000	3692000	It's funny.
3692000	3694000	Anyhow, we'll see.
3694000	3699000	But anyway, before our dream game designer death metal band comes true, we'll see probably Castlevania.
3699000	3701000	current gen.
3701000	3704000	Itagaki is the Gene Simmons of the gaming world.
3704000	3706000	Perfect.
3706000	3708000	The Gene Simmons of the gaming world.
3708000	3710000	Perfect. He needs a reality show.
3710000	3720000	Well, there are some really cool features that were announced for Resistance Retribution.
3720000	3728000	And it kind of works with, a little similar to how some of the PlayStation 2 games would link with the PSP in different ways.
3728000	3733000	Well now, what you're going to be able to do with this is, it's a brand new feature called PSP Plus.
3733000	3742000	And using Resistance Retribution via USB cable, connecting it to your PS3,
3742000	3749000	you will actually be able to use your DualShock 3 controller and play the game just using that.
3749000	3758000	And then, you can also unlock abilities that are in Resistance 2, the character in that game.
3758000	3762000	Nathan Hale, you'll be able to unlock the same abilities for your character in this game.
3762000	3766000	And will also allow you to get to different parts of levels and stuff like that.
3766000	3771000	Kind of think a little bit like the stuff they had with Sonic and Knuckles,
3771000	3775000	where you can plug in the other Sonic games and get to different portions of the game and stuff like that.
3775000	3777000	So, that's kind of cool.
3777000	3783000	And I guess this would also fix that problem with not having the second analog stick,
3783000	3788000	because it does change the controllers though, or the controls around, since you have that second analog stick to look around.
3788000	3792000	Or how about they just redesign the PSP with the second analog stick,
3792000	3797000	instead of having this roundabout way that requires the PlayStation 3 as well.
3799000	3801000	Hmm, I'll check it out though.
3801000	3803000	Yeah, I mean, you're still going to get this game no matter what, right?
3803000	3805000	Resistance 2, it will.
3805000	3810000	Anyhow, also, moving on to one more story on the PSP, and then we're going to get towards our break time tonight.
3810000	3813000	On the PSP, there is the Wi-Fi store.
3813000	3815000	Remember we've been talking about the Wi-Fi store that's coming?
3815000	3816000	Hey, the date has been announced.
3816000	3820000	October 15th, the Wi-Fi store will be launched in Japan,
3820000	3823000	but you know that it's not much longer before it's here.
3823000	3828000	And that probably is in line with the fact that the PSP 3000 comes out this week as well,
3828000	3830000	so don't think there's not a correlation there.
3830000	3832000	With the 5.0 firmware.
3832000	3834000	That's right, 5.0 firmware will also be the same time.
3834000	3838000	The Wi-Fi store is already on the box art for the PSP 3000, so...
3838000	3842000	Well, which makes sense, because if the PSP 3000 doesn't hit street until October 16th,
3842000	3844000	they're basically launching this the day before.
3844000	3845000	There you go.
3845000	3849000	Some games that are going to be sold on the store that already are dated,
3849000	3852000	Secret Agent Clank on November 20th,
3852000	3854000	Patapon 2 on November 27th,
3854000	3856000	and LocoRoco 2 on December 4th.
3856000	3859000	There's that date I was looking for earlier, so yeah,
3859000	3861000	Europe's getting it by a couple weeks.
3861000	3863000	LocoRoco 2 specifically,
3863000	3867000	because the store itself has not been announced for the US or Europe,
3867000	3870000	but I would speculate, well, whenever the new PSP redesign is coming out here,
3870000	3871000	that's when we'll get the store.
3871000	3874000	October, yeah, it's like right around the corner.
3874000	3875000	That's what I thought.
3875000	3880000	Usually those firmware updates, they're all about the same time,
3880000	3881000	like within a day of each other.
3881000	3885000	Alright, so anyhow, the Wi-Fi store is going to be opening soon,
3885000	3888000	and also opening soon as part B of our show,
3888000	3891000	but before we get to part B of our radio show,
3891000	3894000	we need to get to the classic video game of the week.
3894000	3896000	It's a little segment we do here every week on this program
3896000	3900000	where DarkSakura takes a look through history's past
3900000	3902000	to find a game for us to look at.
3905000	3908000	So tell us, DarkSakura, what game should the kids be playing this week?
3908000	3912000	Well, if anyone could guess from the music...
3912000	3914000	They won't hear that on the podcast, by the way.
3914000	3916000	I want to edit that little boo-boo out, so...
3916000	3919000	Well, then I would totally give them a cookie,
3919000	3920000	you know, a virtual cookie,
3920000	3925000	but the game of the week is KOU Gekitai,
3925000	3927000	which came out over here as KOU Flying Squadron.
3929000	3935000	It's a game of a girl who has this ancestral obligation
3935000	3940000	to go destroy monsters while riding on the back of her lazy little dragon friend.
3940000	3947000	Her dragon is named Poji in the American version and the UK version.
3947000	3949000	He was called Spot.
3949000	3951000	But anyway, her...
3951000	3953000	Bunny, I don't see a spot.
3953000	3959000	Her special outfit, though, that she has to wear for destroying evil is a bunny girl suit.
3963000	3969000	It came out... We actually got it as KOU Flying Squadron on the Sega CD over here.
3969000	3973000	There's also KOU Gekitai Katsu Gekihen,
3973000	3976000	which was KOU Flying Squadron 2, which was on Saturn.
3976000	3979000	That's the game. I actually own that one.
3979000	3987000	There was also KOU Gekitai Okira Tamatai Bako, which is like a demo CD.
3987000	3992000	And then there was Ramichan no Oedos Tsugoroku KOU Gekitai Gaiden,
3992000	3998000	which was like a special bonus story for Rami, who is the little girl in the game.
3998000	4000000	So it is a little shooting game.
4000000	4004000	It's a cutesy little shooting game where, like I said,
4004000	4008000	Rami sits on the back of a dragon, and she has a large mallet for hitting enemies.
4008000	4014000	She has an umbrella for hitting enemies, and a bow, so she can shoot arrows at enemies.
4014000	4018000	Rami can bounce on enemies' heads and kill them that way.
4018000	4023000	You can also shoot at them, and you get little bonus buddies to help you.
4023000	4027000	I guess it's like your options that was in KOU Flying Squadron 2.
4027000	4035000	The first one had, it was basically just a few less options of that since it was very limited.
4035000	4038000	And all this audio in it, of course, was redbook audio.
4038000	4040000	Are those pigs that look like people?
4040000	4041000	Yes.
4041000	4044000	Cool.
4044000	4047000	So they're very fun little games.
4047000	4054000	There's also, in KOU Flying Squadron 2, there's another character called Himiko,
4054000	4061000	who made a robot called the Saivi, and she was KOU's rival.
4061000	4064000	I'm not K-O, why am I thinking? Rami's rival.
4064000	4068000	And then there was an intelligent raccoon who was their enemy.
4068000	4071000	He was a member of Greenpeace.
4071000	4075000	And he's from Mexico.
4075000	4077000	A raccoon from Mexico.
4077000	4079000	He was a member of Greenpeace.
4079000	4081000	He was a bad guy.
4081000	4083000	So that's...
4083000	4086000	This looks kind of cute. I've never heard of this game in my life.
4086000	4087000	It's cracked out.
4087000	4091000	Because I didn't really follow the whole Sega empire until years later.
4091000	4093000	But this is cute.
4093000	4095000	Kind of a fun little shmup.
4095000	4097000	It's a fun little game. I love it.
4097000	4098000	Very cool.
4098000	4102000	And also just to go ahead and give a plug to the site, because I checked it out last night.
4102000	4105000	Go to SoaringRabbit.com.
4105000	4110000	There's lots of cool art from the game on there and stuff from the guidebooks and things.
4110000	4112000	It's a really cool little site.
4112000	4115000	KO Flying Squadron is your game of the week.
4115000	4118000	Check it out on the Sega Saturn, if you can.
4118000	4122000	But if you can't, you'll just have to watch clips on YouTube or try to find an emulator or something.
4122000	4124000	Can you emulate Sega Saturn yet? Have they gotten to that point?
4124000	4126000	I think they can. I just haven't bothered.
4126000	4128000	You can play Sega Saturn games.
4128000	4130000	Yes, you can, basically.
4130000	4131000	Alright, awesome.
4131000	4133000	Well hey folks, we're going to take a break.
4133000	4138000	But don't go anywhere, because when we come back there will be plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4138000	4142000	So reports from BlizzCon. We haven't even gotten to BlizzCon yet.
4142000	4148000	So stay tuned. We're hoping somebody's going to call in or we're going to call somebody and get a report.
4148000	4152000	I would say live from BlizzCon, but that can't happen because BlizzCon is now over.
4152000	4155000	So not live from BlizzCon.
4155000	4171000	So we'll be right back in just a little bit with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4185000	4189000	He did. He's going to be the next president.
4189000	4191000	He's like, do you see those fucking lights on the ground?
4191000	4194000	When they get red, STFU.
4194000	4195000	God, I know.
4195000	4199000	Pukaki.
4199000	4202000	Anyhow, we've got some gaming news to get back into.
4202000	4204000	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4204000	4206000	Hope you enjoyed that music break for those of you guys listening live.
4206000	4208000	If you're not listening live, why not?
4208000	4210000	You should join us on Sunday nights live.
4210000	4214000	You can even listen to us on the go, thanks to the OLR PSP website that has the all games radio player.
4214000	4217000	I think some folks are listening to us on iPhones as well.
4217000	4219000	I think there's some application you can use to do that.
4219000	4221000	Some type of tuning program.
4221000	4223000	So, pretty awesome.
4223000	4225000	But we've got some more gaming news to cover.
4225000	4227000	We've got a BlizzCon report to get to.
4227000	4230000	Actually, first off though, since we've been talking about conventions,
4230000	4233000	I want to start this segment off before we get to the actual gaming news.
4233000	4237000	Reading responses to our Twitter question, the pre-OLR Twit,
4237000	4241000	for those of you guys following us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR,
4241000	4246000	we asked the question tonight, and it was actually about the Tokyo Game Show.
4246000	4248000	It was actually what we were asking about tonight.
4248000	4251000	We wanted to know, have you ever wanted to go to the Tokyo Game Show, and why?
4251000	4254000	What's the biggest reason you want to go?
4254000	4257000	Dark Soccer, I'm sure you've wanted to go to the Tokyo Game Show before.
4257000	4258000	I'm Pon Man!
4258000	4259000	Is that why?
4259000	4260000	No.
4260000	4263000	Alright, here's some of our listeners and their responses and why they want to go.
4263000	4268000	Let's see, Javier Altman says, yes, I want to go to Tokyo Game Show.
4268000	4271000	Why? To get into the panties of as many booth babes as humanly possible.
4271000	4273000	Them love Latin cock, oh yeah.
4273000	4275000	That was a nice G-rated response.
4275000	4278000	Dark Tetsuya says, hell yes, I've always wanted to go to Japan anyway,
4278000	4282000	but an event like TGS with all the newest Japanese games do want.
4282000	4286000	Maron Marvel says, heck yes, I could go if I could.
4286000	4289000	Squeenix and Konami are bound to unveil some awesome things to Tokyo Game Show.
4289000	4291000	Plus, you know it's Tokyo.
4291000	4294000	Act Dev says, yes, it's basically E3, but done way better.
4294000	4296000	So it's basically all the great announcements we hear.
4296000	4298000	I would like to hear them firsthand.
4298000	4303000	Jackson Man says, I'm from Kentucky, so going anywhere but here would be nice.
4303000	4305000	Crows says, of course I want to go.
4305000	4308000	Japanese games almost always have more.
4308000	4312000	I want to go and learn which upcoming games have little anime girls.
4312000	4315000	GeoVidea says, oh hell yes, it's Japan.
4315000	4317000	I've been trying to get there for a few years now.
4317000	4319000	MistyOLR says, admittedly not really.
4319000	4323000	I have ASEN and I can actually afford that con compared to going all the way to Japan.
4323000	4326000	A nice realistic answer from Misty.
4326000	4329000	Justin says, nah, it's all about PAX.
4329000	4331000	I did E3 a few times when it was good.
4331000	4334000	That's enough OMG Game Show spectacle for me.
4334000	4336000	So surprisingly, a couple people saying no.
4336000	4340000	I would have assumed that it would have been right 100% yeses across the board.
4340000	4342000	So surprises abound on our Twitter.
4342000	4343000	Thanks for the responses, folks.
4343000	4345000	Well, I think the whole reason that I would really want to go
4345000	4348000	is to go hang out with my friends that live over there.
4348000	4352000	Yeah, you know, just to go somewhere else.
4352000	4354000	I've never been to Japan. It would be fun.
4354000	4359000	I mean, because really, after having been to E3 all those years,
4359000	4362000	it really is a big spectacle, that type of thing, don't you think?
4362000	4364000	There's something about being there.
4364000	4365000	It's like magic in the air.
4365000	4367000	I don't know, it makes you more excited about everything.
4367000	4369000	More like unwashed fanboys in the air over here.
4369000	4370000	Oh, shush.
4370000	4374000	All right, let's get back into some gaming news now that we've heard from you Twitter folks tonight.
4374000	4375000	Loki, all right.
4375000	4378000	Well, this is sort of a rumor right now,
4378000	4383000	but apparently the website tinycartridge.com is reporting
4383000	4392000	that they have found a trademark registered in Japan for what is called DS Scan.
4392000	4394000	And what they theorize it is,
4394000	4401000	is it's something that's going to be used with the DS Eyes camera to unlock DS content.
4401000	4407000	Now, one of the things that they're also speculating is that it's for use with QR codes.
4407000	4409000	Which those who do not know,
4409000	4416000	QR codes are those square kind of pixely looking, almost like a UPC code, basically.
4416000	4418000	And cell phones have them.
4418000	4420000	Most cell phones over in Japan have them.
4420000	4426000	And you find them everywhere, like on boxes, to magazine articles, to websites, etc.
4426000	4428000	And you basically scan it with your camera,
4428000	4433000	and it will take you to a website, reveal more information.
4433000	4440000	Some examples are nutritional information on food, directions on Google Maps,
4440000	4442000	contact details, business cards, etc.
4442000	4446000	Or even links to different game developer sites and stuff like that.
4446000	4448000	So that would be a pretty cool feature,
4448000	4451000	and especially since the DS Eyes is going to have a built-in web browser,
4451000	4453000	I could see something like that actually being implemented.
4453000	4458000	So right now, it's all speculation to see how that's going to work.
4458000	4460000	I don't know.
4460000	4462000	Interesting comments from the chat room.
4462000	4465000	Frisbee in chat, chat.orangestop.com, says,
4465000	4468000	DSI e-reader, and Unfolded Raptor says,
4468000	4472000	Sad thing I actually bought an e-reader, what a waste of money.
4472000	4474000	Act Def says, I have some Animal Crossing e-reader cards.
4474000	4476000	Whatever happened to the e-reader?
4476000	4479000	I think it's one of those peripherals that they didn't really support that much.
4479000	4480000	But could this be something like that?
4480000	4481000	This could be something like that.
4481000	4483000	Like, they could release cards.
4483000	4487000	I would think would be kind of cool.
4487000	4494000	Before, remember, they were talking about doing something with the DS version of Viva Pinata,
4494000	4497000	where they were going to have images that appear on the DS,
4497000	4504000	and you can scan them with your Xbox 360 camera and import your characters into that.
4504000	4506000	Well, now you can do it vice versa that way.
4506000	4509000	Oh, but I'm getting total value for my Xbox 360 camera right now.
4509000	4511000	I mean, did you see Camera Mode in Beaten Groovy?
4511000	4513000	Wahoo!
4513000	4515000	Oh, I'm sorry. I missed that.
4515000	4517000	What was Camera Mode in Beaten Groovy?
4517000	4519000	It's just, now you hit balloons.
4519000	4521000	It's just, it's tacked on junk.
4521000	4522000	Lame. Awesome.
4522000	4528000	No, actually, sadly enough, I'm going to be coming into contact with another camera,
4528000	4531000	because I'm buying that game You're in the Movies.
4531000	4532000	Why?
4532000	4534000	Because it looks fun. It's like a fun party game.
4534000	4535000	Alright.
4535000	4540000	And it unfortunately comes with another camera, so now I have two useless cameras.
4540000	4542000	Congratulations.
4542000	4544000	Yeah.
4544000	4549000	Well, how about some other Nintendo news that you can really get excited about coming out of Tokyo Game Show?
4549000	4552000	No More Heroes 2 is coming out.
4552000	4555000	Now, here's the thing, though.
4555000	4559000	Actually, it wasn't really necessarily confirmed for the Nintendo Wii.
4559000	4560000	Yeah, it's for the Wii.
4560000	4561000	Is it?
4561000	4562000	Oh, okay.
4562000	4564000	Because I remember when they saw the trailer, it didn't say Wii anywhere in it.
4564000	4566000	So some people were actually speculating a little bit.
4566000	4569000	But alright, it sounds like it was confirmed for the Wii, which makes sense.
4569000	4570000	You know, it makes sense.
4570000	4573000	No More Heroes, Desperate Struggle is the name of the game.
4573000	4577000	See, people thought it might have been for the DS, because, you know, Desperate Struggle.
4577000	4578000	DS.
4578000	4579000	Oh, good thought, yeah.
4579000	4581000	So okay, yeah, that makes sense.
4581000	4584000	And of course, there's folks wishful thinking it would be on 360 or PlayStation 3.
4584000	4586000	But I wish it were.
4586000	4589000	It's another Wii game.
4589000	4591000	You played a lot of the first No More Heroes game, Loki.
4591000	4592000	Are you excited?
4592000	4594000	Yeah, I am excited. I thought it looks awesome.
4594000	4597000	And I just wish, though, that it was on the 360.
4597000	4599000	Because it'd be even more awesome.
4599000	4601000	More awesomer?
4601000	4604000	Yeah. Actually, you know, I wish a lot of the games that they're putting on the Wii
4604000	4606000	were on, like, the 360 or PS3.
4606000	4609000	Like, No More Heroes, Mad World.
4609000	4611000	Well, here's what's strange.
4611000	4614000	And, you know, again, here's a story that didn't really make show world tonight.
4614000	4615000	It's just been a busy week.
4615000	4617000	But there's rumors going around about the Wii HD again.
4617000	4620000	And the successor to Nintendo Wii is coming out in 2011.
4620000	4623000	I don't know why this rumor has suddenly caught more steam.
4623000	4627000	And you know who I was looking at was being sourced for the rumor?
4627000	4628000	Get this.
4628000	4632000	WhatTheyPlay.com was being sourced as, like, the start of the rumor, right?
4632000	4636000	Which, you know, just makes me think of WhatTheyPlay.com snap.
4636000	4640000	The reason why is because people keep reporting the same rumor story,
4640000	4643000	but people keep seeing the rumor story on multiple websites.
4643000	4645000	It's like, Oh, my God, it's actually true.
4645000	4647000	But it's actually all the same story.
4647000	4650000	It's just some dude's opinion that used to work for 1UP.
4650000	4652000	Here's the other thing, too, is that it's, you know,
4652000	4654000	will there be a follow-up to Wii?
4654000	4655000	Duh.
4655000	4658000	Yes, of course there's going to be a follow-up to the Wii system.
4658000	4660000	I mean, the thing is sold millions and jillions.
4660000	4662000	Of course there's going to be a follow-up.
4662000	4663000	It's just a question of when.
4663000	4667000	So people like to pull dates out of their fucking butts as to when it's coming.
4667000	4672000	And, you know, if they're off, they'll just say, Oh, it just got delayed.
4672000	4674000	Or, Oh, they're putting it out early.
4674000	4676000	It's just a bunch of crap.
4676000	4677000	Of course there's going to be a Wii follow-up.
4677000	4678000	Why is this news?
4678000	4682000	I saw it, like, on the front page of Yahoo as the successor to the Wii.
4682000	4684000	Who cares?
4684000	4686000	When was that new?
4686000	4687000	I know, for real.
4687000	4688000	Anyway, sorry.
4688000	4690000	It says, When is Yahoo known for reporting game news?
4690000	4694000	Look, I use their mail service, so I see the stuff on the page that they're saying.
4694000	4695000	I know.
4695000	4696000	I completely understand.
4696000	4699000	It's just, you know, it was a little weird to me, that's all.
4699000	4704000	Especially since they're trying to sell some new video gaming news thing.
4704000	4709000	And, you know, if that's your cutting-edge story, I weep for the future.
4709000	4710000	Anyhow.
4710000	4712000	I weep all the time, anyway.
4712000	4713000	Nice.
4713000	4718000	Well, Nintendo points are not going to transfer between the Wii and the DSi.
4718000	4721000	It is, um, official.
4721000	4723000	They have their own points.
4723000	4730000	And let me guess, it'll be one of those things where I have to buy, you know, ten or twenty dollars worth of points at a time,
4730000	4735000	and then the games will cost just enough so that I have, like, three hundred left over at any given time.
4735000	4736000	Yeah.
4736000	4737000	Correct?
4737000	4738000	That's correct.
4738000	4744000	Well, basically, that pretty much is, yeah.
4744000	4746000	But they have to be separate.
4746000	4747000	Yeah.
4747000	4750000	It's totally impossible for a service to do that.
4750000	4760000	It's not like, you know, companies like Microsoft have, I don't know, Microsoft points that you can use on both Xbox Marketplace or, I don't know, the Zune Marketplace.
4760000	4761000	It's totally impossible.
4761000	4763000	That technology does not exist.
4763000	4765000	More like they just don't want to.
4765000	4766000	Of course they don't want to.
4766000	4767000	That would be effort.
4767000	4769000	It's just like effort in, I don't know, making, uh...
4769000	4772000	And less money from our money-making machines.
4772000	4779000	Making a unified online service for the Wii or the DS, or, I don't know, releasing games that aren't really ports.
4779000	4783000	Or innovating a little bit more than just your initial hardware.
4783000	4788000	Redertainment says in chat, it's like selling six hot dogs to a pack by eight buns to a pack.
4788000	4789000	Exactly.
4789000	4790000	That's a perfect analogy.
4790000	4793000	Um, AlphaConanagram says it's all Nintendo points now.
4793000	4794000	That's what I thought.
4794000	4795000	I thought it was gonna be all Nintendo points.
4795000	4796000	It is all Nintendo points now.
4796000	4803000	You know, once you put those Nintendo points in, like, you know, one place and you can't really do anything with them.
4803000	4804000	You're stuck.
4804000	4805000	Yeah, you can't name.
4805000	4806000	Because you have two different accounts.
4806000	4808000	Because, once again, there's no unified online service.
4808000	4809000	Grrr.
4809000	4816000	I'm surprised they don't have, you know, like, a friend code for the points or something like that that you gotta put in.
4816000	4819000	You know, make sure that you can buy that game or something.
4819000	4822000	Or that you have to write with your stylus, all praise Nintendo.
4822000	4824000	Glory, glory, hallelujah.
4824000	4825000	I agree.
4825000	4827000	Do you wish to purchase said game?
4827000	4828000	Blue?
4828000	4829000	Blue?
4829000	4830000	No!
4830000	4835000	In fact, the DSi will actually have a place that will prick your finger for blood every time you, uh, actually want to get points.
4835000	4837000	Yeah, that's how you pay for the games.
4837000	4838000	With your blood.
4838000	4839000	With your soul.
4839000	4845000	It's like, it's like, do you wish to purchase this game and relinquish your soul?
4845000	4846000	What?
4846000	4850000	I just sold my soul for a donut.
4850000	4851000	Yes.
4851000	4852000	Retertainment.
4852000	4853000	That's perfect.
4853000	4854000	You have to write every time.
4854000	4855000	Nintendo, lemming.
4855000	4857000	Bah, bah, bah.
4857000	4858000	Anyhow.
4858000	4862000	You know what segment of ours has to follow a story like this.
4873000	4875000	It's time for the FUs of the Week.
4875000	4887000	My FU of the Week goes towards, um, you know what, I don't know that I have one for once.
4887000	4888000	Gasp.
4888000	4889000	No.
4889000	4891000	FU to your lack of angst?
4891000	4894000	Well, no, it's because I'm a Vicodin.
4894000	4898000	And Vicodin makes you not give a shit about anything.
4898000	4900000	Oh yeah, okay, I've got one.
4900000	4902000	Mr. Moron.
4902000	4904000	FU to people.
4904000	4909000	Anyone who thinks I'm insulted by anything, anyone has to say about me.
4909000	4915000	Because that's obviously a sign that someone else has the issue, and I do not.
4915000	4922000	Don't come to my cubicle expecting me not to tell you to get out of my cubicle.
4922000	4927000	Because, okay, okay, the situation is that someone came into my cubicle, someone who I've had a problem doing this before,
4927000	4933000	came and tried to talk to somebody on the other side of my cubicle, and I'm like, dude, please get out.
4933000	4935000	I need to, you know, do my work.
4935000	4936000	You're bugging me.
4936000	4940000	Get the hell away from me because I don't really like you that much either.
4940000	4947000	And he just started mumbling and just trying to say, you know, just really stupid insulting things.
4947000	4950000	And I got, you know what I did?
4950000	4951000	I laughed.
4951000	4952000	I just laughed.
4952000	4954000	I laughed so hard right there.
4954000	4957000	I was like, dude, you know how stupid you sound?
4957000	4959000	And so he left and didn't bother me the rest of the day.
4959000	4961000	And that's just what I'm going to do from now on.
4961000	4967000	If someone, anyone ever tries to just, you know, be mean, I'm just going to laugh.
4967000	4968000	That's all.
4968000	4971000	My response from now on is going to be, aha.
4971000	4972000	I love this.
4972000	4974000	The Raftian Chat says, I've seen her cubicle.
4974000	4979000	Much like you would expect from Dark Sakura, it's filled with pink fluffy clouds and is generally welcoming.
4979000	4982000	The hell it is.
4982000	4984000	Yeah, I killed him with laughter.
4984000	4987000	Because, I mean, basically, okay, keep in mind, I've had this problem before.
4987000	5001000	And the whole reason that I think that people try to be insulting, especially when they're in the wrong, is to make themselves feel less wrong to put themselves in a position of superiority.
5001000	5005000	And this person has absolutely zero room.
5005000	5008000	And I can say that in a completely unbiased fashion.
5008000	5010000	Yes, I do have the giant Tekken poster in my cubicle.
5010000	5011000	Thank you.
5011000	5012000	That's what you say?
5012000	5014000	No, I was answering that comment.
5014000	5017000	That I just, I just laughed.
5017000	5018000	I just laughed.
5018000	5029000	It's like, how can someone say that I don't know what the hell I'm talking about when this is the same person that asks me how to copy cells in Excel?
5029000	5030000	Don't ask.
5030000	5032000	Control C, control V.
5032000	5033000	Exactly.
5033000	5037000	SSG100 Matt says, you need to set up gun turrets at the entrance of your cubicle.
5037000	5042000	Actually, I was looking at ThinkGeek just a moment ago and they do have USB missile launchers.
5042000	5043000	Those are overrated.
5043000	5045000	Trust me, I have one at my desk.
5045000	5046000	It's just retarded.
5046000	5052000	It sits there for a second and goes eeeeeeee, pop, and then it goes boop, and like falls down a few feet away.
5052000	5054000	I could build a better rocket launcher.
5054000	5056000	It was worth it just to hear Loki's expression.
5056000	5059000	And then it was like beep, and then it goes boop, and it's like boop.
5059000	5061000	My cubicle drains the souls of other people and it gives them to me.
5061000	5064000	They have a way to convert it into an airsoft gun.
5064000	5065000	Oh, Lord.
5065000	5067000	Alright, let's have you use the lead.
5067000	5069000	Any more, Dark Zyra.
5069000	5076000	Also, F you to me not having the money right now to buy the beaker coffee mug from ThinkGeek.
5076000	5077000	Alright, Loki.
5077000	5083000	F you to myself for buying a magazine for my gun that's a double mag.
5083000	5089000	The problem is because it's basically two magazines that are stuck next to each other when I plug it in,
5089000	5093000	the other magazine covers the switch that allows me to pop the magazine out.
5093000	5099000	So it makes it near impossible to take out the magazine once I put it in.
5099000	5103000	Doh! Should have paid attention.
5103000	5106000	Still love it though.
5106000	5108000	Alright, that it?
5108000	5112000	Also an F you to my Triton headphones I've got.
5112000	5117000	Already the left side, basically if you jiggle the cord a little bit, it will go out.
5117000	5121000	So that pisses me off because they were expensive.
5121000	5125000	I want to give an F you to the pig fucker who stole the political sign from my front yard earlier this week,
5125000	5127000	not even 24 hours after I placed it up.
5127000	5131000	As you know, we have a very controversial proposition in the ballot here in California.
5131000	5135000	They want to ban same-sex marriage and take rights away from people
5135000	5139000	and treat certain people of this country differently than others, or of the state, I should say.
5139000	5140000	This is a state proposition.
5140000	5141000	And it's called Proposition 8.
5141000	5144000	They're using scare tactics to do it which aren't even true.
5144000	5146000	They are not going to tax churches.
5146000	5149000	They're not going to force churches to marry people they don't want to marry.
5149000	5151000	Do atheists get married in church right now?
5151000	5153000	Do they force churches to marry people?
5153000	5156000	Can a non-Catholic get married in mass?
5156000	5161000	They don't, I mean, when we were getting married and trying to have a Jewish wedding,
5161000	5170000	you know, the female, what was it, the female, not priest, what's the word I'm looking for here?
5170000	5171000	Rabbi.
5171000	5172000	Rabbi.
5172000	5178000	Yes, the female rabbi, she's like, no, I don't want to marry a non-Jew and a Jew together.
5178000	5180000	I'm like, you're a fucking female rabbi.
5180000	5182000	There's not supposed to be female rabbis, idiot.
5182000	5184000	Fucking contradictive.
5184000	5188000	Look, look, I don't want to turn this into something too political,
5188000	5191000	but obviously I think this is the dumbest proposition of all propositions.
5191000	5198000	And if you support, I guess, bigotry in the 21st century, then I guess you can go vote yes on it
5198000	5201000	because that's all it is, is just, you know, it's hate and discrimination.
5201000	5206000	And like in the fucking year 2008, you wouldn't think that we would have to be fighting for these types of things
5206000	5210000	that our grandparents fought for, but I guess history repeats itself, so what the fuck ever.
5210000	5217000	But anyhow, obviously, for obvious reasons, a very staunch supporter of the No On 8 campaign,
5217000	5222000	so I had a No On 8 sign in the front yard of my house, and it got stolen within 24 hours
5222000	5227000	because that's just the kind of idiocy that's behind the support of this proposition,
5227000	5234000	absolute moronism behind Proposition 8 that would steal a yard sign from the front of my house
5234000	5236000	to make a goddamn point.
5236000	5239000	The point you made was that you're an idiot, end of story.
5239000	5243000	So guess what? I had a second sign waiting in the house, and I promptly put it up in its place.
5243000	5245000	You should electrify it, Rob.
5245000	5249000	The good idea was to rub it down on something sticky.
5249000	5252000	By the way, Sauce pointed out to me, just for me to inform Loki,
5252000	5255000	is that female rabbis are allowed in Reform Judaism.
5255000	5256000	Right, it depends what branch of the-
5256000	5260000	They're allowed, I understand that, but the problem is, like, originally, they're not-
5260000	5262000	That's why it's Reformed.
5262000	5269000	Exactly. But it's okay to also marry, you know, out of the religion, but it's just-
5269000	5273000	They're just being stupid. It's like, oh, so this is okay, but it's not okay.
5273000	5281000	What pisses me off, and I have to add to Rob's F.U., is just, um, like, uh, the, uh-
5281000	5285000	I haven't seen the commercials, but I've heard of them, and I've been told of the content of them.
5285000	5287000	You know, I don't watch TV.
5287000	5292000	You know, them saying all that bullshit is, like, they're trying to appeal to the stupid, pretty much.
5292000	5294000	To the uninformed, to the ignorant.
5294000	5298000	They're trying to scare people that we're gonna have to teach it in schools.
5298000	5301000	That is complete nonsense.
5301000	5303000	They don't teach.
5303000	5305000	Do you talk about regular marriage in schools?
5305000	5309000	Oh, come on, they don't even want to teach about heterosexual sex in school.
5309000	5310000	For real. For real.
5310000	5312000	So where the fuck do they get off?
5312000	5317000	When, when hasn't a child been allowed to sit out of sex education?
5317000	5319000	It's just so ridiculous.
5319000	5320000	You know what, if they-
5320000	5324000	If you believe their lies, I'm sorry. I cannot hold back and play nice on this.
5324000	5327000	If you believe this, you are an idiot.
5327000	5330000	Please unsubscribe from this show. We are too smart for you.
5330000	5335000	Seriously, I'm fucking serious.
5335000	5340000	And, I'll tell you what, if we get any emails to the point, you're not getting read.
5340000	5345000	You're, um, getting published.
5345000	5348000	Your email address is getting published.
5348000	5349000	I don't care, I'll do it.
5349000	5350000	Just bugs me.
5350000	5351000	Yep.
5351000	5352000	Sorry.
5352000	5353000	This is war.
5353000	5355000	But, you know, this is what I have to say, actually, Rob.
5355000	5356000	Yeah, go ahead.
5356000	5359000	Everyone is entitled to their opinion, even though they're wrong.
5359000	5361000	But not on this. I'm sorry.
5361000	5367000	No, this, we have to be fair. This is America.
5367000	5372000	I understand, but at the same time, your rights stop where mine begin.
5372000	5375000	I agree. Now, this was my second point.
5375000	5378000	Is that, yes, you're allowed to disagree.
5378000	5379000	You're allowed to have your belief.
5379000	5381000	That is what this country was founded on.
5381000	5386000	Not God or religion, because Thomas Jefferson certainly, you know, didn't follow that.
5386000	5388000	And he wrote our Declaration of Independence.
5388000	5389000	Fair enough.
5389000	5398000	But my point is that everyone should be allowed to believe and feel what they want to believe and feel.
5398000	5403000	They just have to also be equally tolerant of anyone who believes other than what they do.
5403000	5406000	Like, I tell everybody, be offended. Learn to be offended.
5406000	5408000	I'm having a hard time, Jamie.
5408000	5424000	Learn that someone is going to, but see, this is the problem is that we're dealing with people who aren't leaving it at that. We're dealing with people who are trying to force their point of view on other people and are, and have the majority, you know, view right now.
5424000	5428000	All right. We're getting too much on the political topic, but.
5428000	5436000	No, I firmly believe in, that we should be a more tolerant people.
5436000	5442000	Obviously, it's a very sensitive issue that I have a very strong and invested opinion in for obvious reasons.
5442000	5455000	So if I'm a little bit unhinged, I apologize to a point, but certainly you need to understand that when you are voting yes on this, you are saying my rights are not OK.
5455000	5461000	And that's why I get so fucking incensed.
5461000	5462000	There we go.
5462000	5464000	Sorry.
5464000	5466000	Anyhow, let's get back to the gaming news, shall we?
5466000	5471000	Yay, video games to make everything better and make us forget about what a fucked up world we live in. Right, Loki?
5471000	5482000	Yes. In fact, totally off topic here, but Rogue Squadron could be coming back to the Nintendo consoles very soon, actually.
5482000	5501000	According to rumor mill from EGM that LucasArts has licensed out the Rogue Squadron series for a Wii remake, and then basically instead of a brand new game, they're going to have a compilation of all the Nintendo 64 and GameCube titles on one disc.
5501000	5506000	Might be like one of those play on the Wii things.
5506000	5511000	They were not bad. Those games are pretty good, so that'd be kind of cool.
5511000	5515000	Where is my lightsaber-wielding game?
5515000	5518000	Force Unleashed, the Clone Wars lightsaber duels.
5518000	5522000	No, no, I mean like with the Wiimote and that whole thing. I guess there was the lightsaber duels thing.
5522000	5524000	Wii Sports Resort.
5524000	5526000	Oh yes, I forgot. Wii Sports Resort, OK.
5526000	5537000	Let me put it this way. I wouldn't want to see one until the Wii Motion Plus came out anyways, and even one that came out, I mean, they could port the arcade game. Remember the arcade game?
5537000	5541000	I love the arcade game. That was fun.
5541000	5546000	Yeah, so GS68 said almost at the exact same time in chat, Star Wars trilogy arcade games bonus rounds.
5546000	5548000	There you go.
5548000	5556000	Alright, hey, one of the biggest websites of the past five years, or maybe of the past decade, I mean, who does not visit YouTube?
5556000	5564000	I mean, it's an awesome, awesome website. We even have some stuff up on YouTube. We haven't updated it in forever, but we have a YouTube channel with some of our old news broadcasts that were on there.
5564000	5570000	Who doesn't watch YouTube to catch up on some great clips from TV and Friends or whatever? This is an awesome site.
5570000	5579000	And video games have really taken over on YouTube. I mean, heck, all these classic games of the week that Dark Soccer is reporting on, you can search for any of them on YouTube and look at clips of the game.
5579000	5584000	And there's new game reviews and there's tons and tons of video game content out on YouTube.
5584000	5589000	Well now, what YouTube has decided they want to do, they're going to try to use this to profit.
5589000	5595000	Because right now, where does YouTube make a profit? There's not a lot of advertising on the site.
5595000	5602000	It's very interesting that considering they don't sell much on YouTube, they still manage to make money.
5602000	5610000	Well, they're going to try to take that one step further and it's going to start with some of the music based on EMI music and Universal.
5610000	5619000	Well now, it's also going to be video games made by EA. So apparently, when you go like, let's say you visit a YouTube of a game made from EA, you'll be able to buy the game right there.
5619000	5627000	So there you go. It's kind of neat. And then YouTube will get a cut of the game sales. So YouTube will sell you games. There you go.
5627000	5633000	That's a good tie-in. I mean, it's kind of a duh. I'm kind of surprised it didn't really happen before.
5633000	5644000	But I'm curious, what about the retro games? Those are a little harder to find. But maybe eBay links or something. Who knows? Or links to used game stores, I guess.
5644000	5653000	There you have it. YouTube. I wonder if soon you'll be able to buy DVDs of TV shows that you see on YouTube.
5653000	5657000	Or like, you know, like, TV for chocolate rain.
5657000	5665000	I hardly ever buy things on the internet anyway. Very rare. I like to go in the store and have it in my hand. There's something to be said for that.
5665000	5667000	Some things you can't buy in stores.
5667000	5668000	Well, whatever.
5668000	5670000	You can buy happiness in a store.
5670000	5672000	I cannot buy happiness in a store.
5672000	5673000	I do all the time.
5673000	5675000	Is your mic on? You're very quiet for some reason.
5675000	5677000	Yes, it is on.
5677000	5678000	There we go. Now I hear you.
5678000	5679000	Dun dun dun.
5679000	5680000	Alright, sorry. Moving on.
5680000	5686000	Well, there is a bit more happy news. Why is it that I'm just getting all the happy news, Rob?
5686000	5690000	I don't know. I just, I knew you'd be on Vicodin tonight, so you just want to be happy happy.
5690000	5694000	You'd rather give me stuff, because you know if I don't care about something else, I don't care about it.
5694000	5696000	But this is very, very, very happy news.
5696000	5702000	For Street Fighter IV home releases, there's been another female character confirmed.
5702000	5705000	And it's Sakura! I'm very happy.
5705000	5708000	And I watched video of it, actually, today, Rob.
5708000	5713000	And she's there in her full kickass glory, so I'm quite thrilled with that.
5713000	5724000	But she was confirmed, actually, to Famitsu by Yoshinori Ono that she was going to definitely be in the home version.
5724000	5729000	And there's also going to be a few more things in the home version, including a training mode.
5729000	5736000	Now, even though this Sakura isn't where you get your name, contrary to popular belief, you're still pretty excited about this, right?
5736000	5737000	Oh, hell yeah.
5737000	5750000	I actually, after there came out Dark Sakura from Marvel Superheroes vs. Street Fighter, I actually adopted her as my online avatar for a while.
5750000	5751000	Cute.
5751000	5759000	Oh, I remember that. Way back in the day on the Sacramento's DDR forum, your little avatar was Dark Sakura, the actual one.
5759000	5771000	But I had taken the picture from the ending of Rival Schools and did the sunburnt look to her and made her sailor dress black and make her red eyes.
5771000	5772000	Cool. Very cool.
5772000	5774000	Early photoshopping before I had photoshopped.
5774000	5777000	Well, I think we're all going to be playing Street Fighter IV. I'm excited about that game.
5777000	5778000	Heck yeah.
5778000	5780000	I wish it was out by Christmas, but then again, I also don't.
5780000	5781000	I wish it was out by right now.
5781000	5787000	I also kind of don't because I need my games to be spaced out right about now because I'm still trying to work on Silent Hill Homecoming.
5787000	5792000	And then I've got World of Warcraft going on, which by the way, I deemed 50 on my alt. Thank you very much.
5792000	5799000	I will have you know though that, what was it, Street Fighter IV is supposed to be coming out around the time as the brand new Street Fighter movie.
5799000	5802000	Awesome. That'll give you a nice fresh taste in your mouth.
5802000	5810000	Anyways, Guitar Hero. World Tour is right around the corner, only a few weeks away.
5810000	5816000	And with that is going to be some brand new download content available for the game.
5816000	5829000	They're going to have a classic rock track pack filled with a bunch of different things, including Rock and Roll Band by Boston, Hot-Blooded by Foreigner, and Jessie's Girl by Rick Springfield.
5829000	5830000	Awesome.
5830000	5838000	And then also they're going to have a few more tracks, Blind Melons, No Rain.
5838000	5840000	Dear God, I hate that song.
5840000	5841000	What? I love that song.
5841000	5842000	Which is in Rock Band too right now.
5842000	5843000	Overplayed?
5843000	5844000	Aww.
5844000	5846000	A couple...
5846000	5848000	No wait, Blind Melon isn't in Rock Band 2 are they?
5848000	5850000	No Rain I think is in there.
5850000	5854000	I don't think it is. No, I don't think it is. I would have bought that shit if it was. I actually like that song.
5854000	5856000	I thought it was. Well, whatever.
5856000	5862000	Anyways, oh no, I'm thinking Grand Theft Auto. I'm sorry. It's in Grand Theft Auto's radio thing.
5862000	5863000	Aha.
5863000	5866000	Anyways, R.E.M. is going to have a few tunes on there.
5866000	5874000	Horse to Water, Man's Size Wreath, and Supernatural Superserious.
5874000	5877000	Supernatural Superserious?
5877000	5878000	Yeah.
5878000	5882000	God, they never put in the one R.E.M. song I'd like to have in there.
5882000	5883000	Which is?
5883000	5885000	Don't Fall On Me.
5885000	5886000	What album was that on?
5886000	5890000	It was on Document I think.
5890000	5896000	I'm disappointed to see that they don't have some of the Phil Collins stuff in there.
5896000	5898000	Like the ones where it's...
5898000	5901000	Was it Hold On I guess?
5901000	5903000	We need Land of Confusion.
5903000	5907000	I am just very excited to get to play Rick Springfield in Guitar Hero.
5907000	5909000	That is going to be all kinds of awesome.
5909000	5913000	Guitar Hero World Tour, although I don't think I'm going to have the whole setup of my house.
5913000	5921000	I'll play along with the charade, that doesn't seem to be a reason to change.
5921000	5923000	You know I feel so dirty when they start...
5923000	5924000	Awesome.
5924000	5927000	Let me see if I can get the game only version, but I know I'm not buying another...
5927000	5928000	I'll probably get the...
5928000	5929000	I want the guitar.
5929000	5931000	I want the new guitar and I want the game.
5931000	5932000	But that's it.
5932000	5934000	I don't need the drums and all that other shit.
5934000	5937000	Hey, Rock Band's getting some new stuff too.
5937000	5942000	And if you like Motley Crue, this is going to be your week.
5942000	5945000	Because this is the week that you're getting Dr. Feelgood, the album.
5945000	5947000	Sweet.
5947000	5949000	That is all kinds of awesome.
5949000	5951000	What's that?
5951000	5953000	Was that the one that had Don't Go Away Mad?
5953000	5955000	Well, no.
5955000	5956000	Damn.
5956000	5957000	Oh no it does, yeah it does.
5957000	5958000	That would be my favorite Motley Crue song.
5958000	5960000	Don't Go Away Mad, Just Go Away.
5960000	5962000	I mean it has fucking Dr. Feelgood.
5962000	5964000	This song is all kinds of awesome.
5964000	5973000	Great album.
5973000	5975000	He's the one that got Dr. Feelgood.
5975000	5980000	Anyway, Slice of Your Pie, Rattlesnake Shake, Kickstart My Heart.
5980000	5982000	Lots and lots and lots of good songs coming out.
5982000	5985000	No other random songs announced yet.
5985000	5987000	Those are the only ones they've announced so far.
5987000	5988000	There might be...
5988000	5992000	Sometimes there's been like little random offerings from other bands that show up as well with the albums.
5992000	5994000	But nothing so far this week.
5994000	5996000	Stephen Colbert songs.
5996000	5998000	Did Stephen Colbert have any other songs?
5998000	6000000	We need Singing in Korean on there.
6000000	6003000	Or I want to see more South Park songs.
6003000	6005000	Or more DVDA stuff.
6005000	6007000	They should be doing...
6007000	6009000	They Might Be Giants.
6009000	6011000	And more Jonathan Coulton.
6011000	6012000	We'll see.
6012000	6014000	I love School Crusher Mountain, but I could totally use Ikea.
6014000	6016000	Like we need America Fuck Yeah.
6016000	6018000	Or the montage song.
6018000	6020000	Gonna need a montage.
6020000	6024000	Alright, let's get into the Journey to the Wonderland song.
6024000	6026000	Because this song is awesome and it always means...
6026000	6028000	It's mailbag time!
6028000	6030000	Every week you send this mail at email...
6030000	6032000	I'm sorry, at mailbag at orangelaunchready.com.
6032000	6035000	Dark Sakura goes into the mailbag and reads her favorite emails.
6035000	6040000	Unfortunately, since there was no show and ended up getting posted on the feed last week, I believe we have Slim Pickens tonight.
6040000	6042000	Three emails.
6042000	6044000	Let's hear them.
6044000	6047000	This one comes from Robert M.
6047000	6050000	Note, I am not able to get into chat for some reason.
6050000	6055000	If this topic has already been discussed on tonight's show, please do not trouble yourself with reading this on the air.
6055000	6060000	I also missed last week's show and haven't gotten the podcast for same yet.
6060000	6064000	Topic is Lord British in space. Best thing ever. Discuss.
6064000	6067000	That would be freaking rad.
6067000	6069000	Has he launched yet?
6069000	6071000	I knew he was a private citizen that was going to be going.
6071000	6073000	Like he's one of the famous...
6073000	6076000	He bought the Russian space tourist thing and I'd heard about that.
6076000	6078000	But I didn't know if he'd actually gone yet.
6078000	6080000	See, I was thinking of Gradius.
6080000	6082000	It's supposed to happen this year at some point.
6082000	6084000	I was thinking of Gradius in Salamander.
6084000	6086000	So that's why I said best thing ever.
6086000	6089000	If he's got a little ship, that would be great.
6089000	6091000	Umm...
6091000	6093000	An Ultima game in space.
6093000	6098000	But really, this is basically civilian in space, right?
6098000	6102000	Yes, except the civilian in question happens to be a famous game designer.
6102000	6110000	Seriously. I actually think that it would be a very good thing, I think, to have more civilians.
6110000	6113000	You know, to be able to have that go through.
6113000	6118000	Because that just puts us that much closer to colonizing the moon.
6118000	6120000	And then...
6120000	6122000	Space monkeys.
6122000	6129000	I'm sorry, I was looking at the little iPhone game that John has.
6129000	6131000	The space monkey game.
6131000	6132000	Space monkeys.
6132000	6135000	We need space monkeys.
6135000	6137000	Next one, shall we?
6137000	6138000	Sure, next email.
6138000	6140000	This one comes from Rob with Two Bees.
6140000	6143000	I don't know if this is an old story, but I found it on Dig.
6143000	6147000	Most of the myths debunked are the media effects on children.
6147000	6149000	There's one myth I have, personal debunking knowledge.
6149000	6151000	And that's whether...
6151000	6154000	Because gamers are used to train soldiers to kill.
6154000	6156000	No, games are being used to train soldiers to kill.
6156000	6158000	And they have the same impact on kids who play them.
6158000	6161000	They used to work in trainers and simulators for the army.
6161000	6163000	And they're not even close to the games we play.
6163000	6169000	Even when they use the same basic software, it's modded for realism and specific training goals.
6169000	6173000	And he says he has the same shirt in the stock photo in the article.
6173000	6177000	I'm pulling up the article because I'd actually like to go over it.
6177000	6178000	If you don't mind.
6178000	6180000	Sure.
6180000	6184000	The availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence.
6184000	6188000	Which actually says that we're at a 30 year low. Like, I had brought that up before a while back, right?
6188000	6190000	I believe so.
6190000	6194000	Scientific evidence links violent gameplay to youth aggression.
6194000	6203000	And that's actually saying that claims like this are the work of researchers who represent one relatively narrow school of research, media effects.
6203000	6207000	The research includes some 300 studies of media violence.
6207000	6211000	But most of these studies are inconclusive and many have been criticized on methodical grounds.
6211000	6215000	So, I'm sorry. Methodological grounds.
6215000	6218000	Children are the primary market for video games.
6218000	6224000	And actually the center of the video game market is actually older teen to adult.
6224000	6228000	Almost no girls play computer games. Bullshit!
6228000	6236000	And five was the one that Rob said in his email because it's to train soldiers to kill and that's no.
6236000	6239000	Dude, even anyone should know that.
6239000	6243000	Six video games are not a meaningful form of expression.
6243000	6246000	I love this one and it was also my birthday.
6246000	6256000	On April 19, 2002, US District Judge Steven and Lembal Sr. will the video games do not convey ideas and thus enjoy no constitutional protection.
6256000	6261000	As evidence, St. Louis County presented the judge with videotaped excerpts from four games.
6261000	6266000	All within a narrow range of genre and all the subject of previous controversy.
6266000	6271000	Overturning a similar decision in Indianapolis Federal Court of Appeals, Judge Richard Posner noted,
6271000	6278000	Violence has always been and remains a central interest of humankind and a recurrent, even obsessive theme of both culture, high and low.
6278000	6286000	It engages the interest of children from an early age, as anyone familiar with the classic fairy tales collected by Grimm Anderson and Perrault are aware.
6286000	6293000	To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be chaotic,
6293000	6301000	excuse me, deforming, it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it.
6301000	6305000	That is, that's beautiful.
6305000	6312000	I mean, so basically, in a nutshell, you can't go shielding your children from every violent and terrible thing that's going to happen.
6312000	6316000	They're not going to have any frame of reference for when they're an adult.
6316000	6319000	And trust me, I know people who are like this.
6319000	6329000	There's a, one of my, I guess it's more of a, someone I know through a friend, but she was never allowed to watch the news,
6329000	6334000	never allowed to read anything but what her mother let her read, you know, that type of thing.
6334000	6342000	And she's very, very ill prepared for her life now. I mean, to the point of about to lose her children, so.
6342000	6349000	And if kids don't know how to deal with a zombie infestation now, what's going to happen when it really does happen?
6349000	6350000	Seriously.
6350000	6354000	The other one on here was video game play is socially isolating.
6354000	6361000	And the first sentence is, much video game play is social. Almost 60% of frequent gamers play with friends.
6361000	6366000	33% play with siblings and 25% play with spouses or parents.
6366000	6376000	8. Video game play is desensitizing. And, no. It's not.
6376000	6381000	The Rob D. has a very funny comment in chat there. It says video game play is isolating.
6381000	6384000	That's why I'm in a chat room with 40 other people and I've met a lot of them.
6384000	6386000	Talking about the various conventions and stuff.
6386000	6387000	Exactly.
6387000	6389000	Funny. Funny.
6389000	6395000	So, just more goes to show that, you know, there's idiots in power.
6395000	6397000	So, another email?
6397000	6398000	Yes. Last one.
6398000	6399000	Actually from the Rob D.
6399000	6400000	Alrighty.
6400000	6403000	What's up, OLR hosts? Back at PAX.
6403000	6407000	Amongst the random conversation between bites of delicious food at Wild Ginger,
6407000	6412000	I mentioned that while I have friends that are into video games, I have no friends that are willing to make a podcast with me.
6412000	6419000	That got me thinking. You've talked about the origins of OLR before, but were you all willing to give it a try right away?
6419000	6427000	As I recall, a couple of you had had previous radio experience, so that probably delayed a few of your initial worries about starting your own internet radio show.
6427000	6430000	Still, did any of you have to be talked into it?
6430000	6433000	One of us just showed up every show until we said, fine, you can join.
6433000	6436000	Yeah. Loki just kind of showed up, but that was cool.
6436000	6446000	That was originally what it was supposed to be, is it was like the weekly gathering of people to talk about, you know, games, and specifically DDR back in the day of OLR's origins.
6446000	6451000	Let's continue. Did you imagine you'd still be doing it after all of this time?
6451000	6452000	No.
6452000	6455000	Yes. I thought we would.
6455000	6456000	After this long...
6456000	6457000	I'm stubborn.
6457000	6467000	Since Understation Live ended, for me, I mean, obviously it's still going, but since it ended for me because of Travis' move, no, I didn't think this show would outlast Understation Live.
6467000	6472000	I really didn't. But we've all, you're right, we've all been kind of stubborn and haven't gone anywhere.
6472000	6480000	You know, we're still here in SAC and although our lives have all gone through significant changes, certainly, nobody's really left or, you know what I mean?
6480000	6487000	So, I felt that I would keep, I would at least keep broadcasting in some way or another. That was...
6487000	6490000	Honestly, I think that's part of the reason why Orange Laundry was started in the first place.
6490000	6495000	So, no, none of us had to be talked into it because you hit the nail on the head, we all kind of were doing it anyway.
6495000	6498000	So, it was kind of like a chance for us to kind of talk about something.
6498000	6507000	You know, I don't want to say that we wanted to talk about because we certainly had that outlet on Understation Live, but maybe something different that we felt we had a lot more to say, if that makes sense.
6507000	6509000	I think it's kind of where this started.
6509000	6513000	Well, to continue, if I may.
6513000	6514000	Sure.
6514000	6517000	I was going to say, you may. Sorry. I've been listening to Rocky.
6517000	6518000	You may.
6518000	6523000	When did you know it was something that you wanted to continue doing?
6523000	6533000	I think it was just sort of, we just sort of kept doing it. I mean, it's not a conscious decision. Are we going to keep doing OLR?
6533000	6539000	I think the moment that we had 12 listeners the first night and we were like, cool, somebody is actually listening to this.
6539000	6542000	I think we've grown since the 12 listeners.
6542000	6544000	A little bit, thanks to podcasting. Just a little bit, yeah.
6544000	6549000	Finally, were there any people you asked to host OLR that didn't want to do it?
6549000	6555000	In other words, are there any lost OLR hosts or hosts that could have been?
6555000	6557000	No, it was always going to be Jamie and I.
6557000	6562000	And then Loki came on after, you know, because he was so involved and so into it and was doing so much.
6562000	6565000	I mean, it would be stupid not to add him, obviously.
6565000	6566000	Rob and I had a meeting.
6566000	6569000	I can't picture the show without him all these years later, honestly.
6569000	6571000	Rob and I actually did have a meeting.
6571000	6572000	Yes.
6572000	6574000	And we were like, should we just make Loki a host?
6574000	6577000	Yeah, that's pretty much how it went.
6577000	6578000	And lo and behold.
6578000	6584000	No, the idea, the concept kind of formed between Jamie and I and that's where it is.
6584000	6586000	There was no really other host considered.
6586000	6594000	Guests, people, I think you've pretty much heard everybody we've wanted to have on the show.
6594000	6596000	I want Igarashi.
6596000	6600000	Well, I mean, you know what I mean, like local-wise and local other DDR peeps.
6600000	6602000	We need to get Dan back on the show.
6602000	6603000	Yeah.
6603000	6606000	Okay, next paragraph.
6606000	6607000	By the way, I just want to say real quick.
6607000	6608000	We also got another email in.
6608000	6614000	VXChaseXV in chats, who's obviously been following us a long, long time, says the podcast specifically,
6614000	6618000	podcasting into the main show, I think that was when it really hit the ground running.
6618000	6622000	OLR moved on from just Bomani to video games that don't suck and podcasting.
6622000	6624000	That was the real time.
6624000	6629000	I admit, even the show does seem to have a different feel to it now, but it's a natural evolution.
6629000	6630000	We got older.
6630000	6633000	We actually have a bit more structure.
6633000	6636000	We didn't really talk about news much when we started.
6636000	6640000	We just were pretty much talked about whatever we wanted to.
6640000	6645000	And I had a migraine the first show, so I didn't know if that was any kind of sign.
6645000	6649000	I was sitting in that chair with ice on my head.
6649000	6652000	Before they made Head On, there was ice on.
6652000	6653000	Nice.
6653000	6656000	But next paragraph.
6656000	6659000	Also, what did you think about the Mega Man 9 downloadable content?
6659000	6664000	On one hand, I will buy it and love that we're finally going to be able to play as Proto Man.
6664000	6671000	On the other hand, things like the endless stage and the special stage make me worried that things we used to take for granted as unlockables,
6671000	6675000	extra stages, and characters are now being turned into pay-as-you-go items.
6675000	6681000	I know gaming is a business, and I appreciate that Capcom is in tune with the fans to put Proto Man in the game.
6681000	6684000	I wish it didn't have to come at my expense.
6684000	6686000	Thanks, Rob D.
6686000	6690000	P.S. Looks like I'll have to buy OE for Tatunoko vs. Capcom.
6690000	6692000	Sad. I can't pass it up.
6692000	6696000	Rob hit the nail on the head that this is kind of where we're seeing the industry going,
6696000	6700000	is that now we're having to pay for things we used to just unlock for fun, which is sad.
6700000	6703000	But I can't give an opinion on the Mega Man 9 download content because I haven't got it.
6703000	6704000	There's still unlockables.
6704000	6706000	There are, but you know what I mean.
6706000	6708000	Rob, try the Proto Man thing. It's fun.
6708000	6710000	I do. I want to check it out.
6710000	6713000	Or as he was originally called, blues.
6713000	6715000	Rob's apologizing for the long email.
6715000	6716000	Don't apologize.
6716000	6718000	It was actually fun. It was a little bit retro.
6718000	6720000	It gave us time to get another email.
6720000	6724000	It did. Alright, quickly. I told somebody we'd be calling them in ten minutes.
6724000	6726000	Okay. It's actually from Sauce.
6726000	6727000	Sweet.
6727000	6728000	It's a game review.
6728000	6729000	We can make time for Sauce.
6729000	6730000	Yeah.
6730000	6735000	Hello all. A month after the Nintendo DS game Dragon Quest IV Chapters of the Chosen was released,
6735000	6739000	I finally had the chance to finish playing through the game and give it a somewhat in-depth review.
6739000	6741000	Please. I want to know more about this, actually.
6741000	6746000	I wound up playing the original Dragon Quest IV and then Chapters of the Chosen back to back
6746000	6751000	in order to compare the remake to the original, so I would better appreciate what the remake has to offer.
6751000	6756000	Overall, the game is as close to perfect as a classic RPG can be.
6756000	6759000	It's definitely worth checking out for those who have played the original Dragon Quest IV
6759000	6763000	and those who have never played the game before alike.
6763000	6767000	As always, the full review can be found on my blog at AvengersTower.com
6767000	6769000	or through my Twitter, Mar and Marvel.
6769000	6771000	Keep up the great job, OLR.
6771000	6775000	I look forward to coming out to Sacramento again soon to see you all again.
6775000	6776000	And that's from Mar.
6776000	6778000	Yay! Whatever happened to her moving here?
6778000	6780000	And I'm going to copy the link in the chat.
6780000	6781000	Is that still something that might happen?
6781000	6783000	I hope. I wish.
6783000	6784000	I hope so too.
6784000	6786000	It must happen.
6786000	6789000	Alright. We'll see. One of us. One of us.
6789000	6795000	Alright. Let's move on. We've got some BlizzCon news.
6795000	6796000	Yes.
6796000	6798000	By the way, if you want to email us, mailbagorangelunchrated.com.
6798000	6800000	Some news coming out of BlizzCon.
6800000	6806000	Yes. First thing that came out of BlizzCon was the new class revealed for Diablo III.
6806000	6808000	New class is Wizard.
6808000	6810000	Wizard!
6810000	6811000	Yes.
6811000	6812000	Please tell me the game will say,
6812000	6815000	Blue Wizard is about to die.
6815000	6816000	Wrong game.
6816000	6817000	Aw, dammit.
6817000	6818000	But the wizard is blue.
6818000	6822000	Actually, the wizard was yellow and gauntlet, but never mind.
6822000	6824000	The wizard is blue in this one.
6824000	6826000	Oh, okay. Well, cool.
6826000	6838000	Anyways, they didn't really say exactly too much about it other than the wizard can hurl lightning, can channel explosive arcane energies.
6838000	6842000	It's a fucking wizard! What else do you need to know? I mean, seriously.
6842000	6844000	It's a fucking wizard.
6844000	6850000	I mean, is it suddenly going to have a sword and shield? No, it's a wizard. Magic. End.
6850000	6851000	Right?
6851000	6853000	It would be a red wizard that would have a sword and shield there.
6853000	6855000	Shut up.
6855000	6857000	Yeah, that's it.
6857000	6858000	There you go.
6858000	6863000	Well, also some other news about Diablo III. You know, people have been begging Blizzard to put World of Warcraft on consoles.
6863000	6872000	And what's interesting about Diablo III and some of the news that's come out about Diablo III is that possibly it could be coming to consoles.
6872000	6879000	I guess this was based off a very veiled comment that came out of BlizzCon, but you know what? Take it with a grain of salt.
6879000	6885000	It's probably not going to happen right away. Because what was the last thing Blizzard did on a console?
6885000	6891000	The Viking game, right? And then Starcraft Ghost got aborted, so there really wasn't anything else.
6891000	6895000	So Diablo III consoles? Probably not for a long time, folks.
6895000	6898000	By the way, some other little tidbits out of BlizzCon.
6898000	6902000	You will soon be able to use your mounts in the water in a future World of Warcraft patch.
6902000	6907000	Right now, if you try to run across a river on your mount, you will automatically dismount.
6907000	6911000	And now your mounts will apparently work in the water, so you can try to drown your horse. Isn't that nice?
6911000	6913000	There you have it.
6913000	6920000	By the way, to hear some other things about BlizzCon, we're actually going to get an old OLR buddy here on the phone who is actually at BlizzCon.
6920000	6924000	We want to talk to them about their experience at BlizzCon, so we're giving them a call right now.
6924000	6927000	One ringy dingy.
6929000	6931000	Two ringy dingys.
6931000	6933000	Hopefully he answers the phone.
6933000	6936000	Hello, is this Extopher?
6936000	6937000	Yes.
6937000	6940000	Hello, Extopher. How are you?
6942000	6944000	I'm fine, and you?
6944000	6946000	Ah, my mom.
6947000	6949000	Why? Why?
6949000	6952000	Because I didn't go to BlizzCon like you, you asshole.
6952000	6960000	Oh, I'm sorry. Well, you know, I don't know what to do for that, but I did, so whatever.
6960000	6967000	Alright, well, how was BlizzCon? Tell us about the trip. What did you do? How was it? You know, walk us through your experience at BlizzCon.
6967000	6981000	Well, it was pretty cool. We got there a day before it started, and we picked up our bags, and it was kind of confusing how to pick up our goody bags.
6981000	6990000	Once we did, we got back to our hotel, kind of looked at it all, and there was a lot of stuff that was in there that they didn't list on the website, actually.
6990000	7001000	They gave us a bunch of, everybody got a free authenticator that was BlizzCon's theme, so it has like a BlizzCon logo on it and everything.
7001000	7005000	Wait, you got a free authenticator? You fucker.
7005000	7007000	Well, yeah, we all got that.
7007000	7009000	I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry.
7009000	7010000	What was that?
7010000	7013000	I was just talking about how much I hate you, sorry, go ahead.
7013000	7025000	Oh, okay, I hate you too. So, yeah, and then we got there in the morning the next day, and pretty much watched the panels.
7025000	7030000	We waited in line at the BlizzCon store for three hours before we got to the front of it.
7030000	7034000	Oh my God, what was so important that you had to get?
7034000	7046000	Well, I wanted a shirt, and Annie, my sister, wanted also a shirt and one of their little messenger bags that they have.
7046000	7060000	So, yeah, we waited really long for that, and then Jim, my brother-in-law, got my sister a Murloc, which was a big collectible thing this year, I guess.
7060000	7070000	And so, it was pretty fun. There was a lot of panels, a lot of exciting, like, new things that we got to see.
7070000	7083000	We got to see walkthroughs of four of the dungeons, and we also got to see Jay Moore again this year, which was fun.
7083000	7092000	I like that comment from Redertainment in chat right now. He says, I waited three hours and all I got was this fucking shirt.
7092000	7094000	I know, that's what I said.
7094000	7108000	What were some of the awesome things that happened at the panels? We talked about some of the news already a little bit on the show, how you can use your mounts and water, you'll be able to on one of the patches, but, like, what was something that happened at the panels that got a huge response from the crowd?
7108000	7118000	I think that, just, I don't know, like, it's very general, because a lot of things got big responses.
7118000	7128000	When I was at the panels in particular, I was at the dungeons and raids panel, I was at half of the PVP panel.
7128000	7141000	And I think that class balance is really a big issue on a lot of people's minds, is how are they going to balance the classes, especially with the Death Knights being the big, like, new class.
7141000	7160000	And they kind of really validated everybody's concerns, which I think made everyone happy, and so I think everything that they said, every answer that they gave that had to do with class balance was particularly, like, good to hear for a lot of people.
7160000	7178000	I don't know if we mentioned it on this show yet tonight, but I think we were talking about it a little bit with Bobby when we were doing the tease on the Bobby Black Wolf show before us here on All Games Radio, we were mentioning that some guy had a Diablo 3 shirt that actually worked for Blizzard that had, like, unicorns and rainbows on it, and it was a Diablo 3 shirt.
7178000	7179000	Did you see that shirt?
7179000	7180000	Yeah.
7180000	7181000	I won it.
7181000	7199000	No, I didn't see the shirt, but there was a funny thing that happened. During the closing ceremony, they actually showed that on the big screen. Like, they were making fun of Diablo 3, and then they showed it, and everybody just, like, lost it. It was crazy.
7199000	7200000	Awesome.
7200000	7201000	But, yeah, it was fun.
7201000	7202000	Speaking of Diablo 3...
7202000	7203000	By the way...
7203000	7204000	Go ahead.
7204000	7205000	Go ahead.
7205000	7215000	Oh, I was gonna say, Patton Oswalt was incredibly funny. Like, he is great to see in person. Like, everybody loved him.
7215000	7218000	Did he make a bunch of WoW jokes or something? Call you all nerds?
7218000	7235000	No, he actually, he's never played WoW in his life, but he put people down for making fun of him for that, and it was great. He, like, played off of the audience, like, so well, and he had a bunch of geek jokes, and he was not censored, which was great, so...
7235000	7240000	Did you get to put your hands on any of the games that were on the floor? Because you had, like, Diablo 3, Starcraft 2.
7240000	7241000	Yeah.
7241000	7242000	What'd you play?
7242000	7255000	Well, last year I played Starcraft 2, and I'm not a big, like, real-time strategy, like, type of person, so I thought it was fine for what it was, but I did get a chance this year to play Diablo 3, and I was sold.
7255000	7265000	Like, it's definitely really fun. I've never played Diablo in my life before that, and it was absolutely wonderful. I definitely recommend it when it comes out.
7265000	7271000	Well, it's not even anywhere near finished yet, which makes it, like, even more incredible to me.
7271000	7274000	What was the demo like? Like, what did you get to do in the demo?
7274000	7300000	Well, you could choose your class, which there's only three playable classes right now, and after that you go into this, like, dungeon-y area, and basically my sister and my brother-in-law, we, all three of us, grouped up into a party, and we all three, like, just had fun, just kind of, like, mashing the buttons and seeing what abilities we could, you know, use or whatever.
7300000	7325000	None of us had played the game before, so we didn't really know how to control it, so we were kind of noobs learning for the first time, but it was actually surprisingly easy, and there's a lot of different, like, creepy little enemies, and, I don't know, they're all, like, skeletal, and there's a lot of blood in it, and I don't know, it's like a dungeon-y type place.
7325000	7331000	Awesome. Well, any other, like, what would you say was the best thing about BlizzCon?
7331000	7348000	The best thing this year about BlizzCon was the contest ceremony. Jay Moore absolutely killed it, and I don't care if you don't like Jay Moore, I think he was hilarious, and he actually created a lot of new fans that night.
7348000	7373000	And the actual dance contest was just the best, like, they had an undead female dance that, like, I don't know what it was, it, like, mesmerized everybody, just, the whole audience, like, went crazy, like, 5,000-whatever people that were in there were just, like, all cheering for this girl, so it was pretty cool.
7373000	7383000	Well, we have some questions from the chat room that I want to ask you. Retertainment is asking, did someone ask Jay Moore if his show was cancelled?
7383000	7392000	You know, nobody got to ask Jay Moore anything, but I'm sure he'll have a cancelled show within the next few weeks or so.
7392000	7400000	DJ Dark Knight wants to know, did you go to any of the tournaments that were going on?
7400000	7424000	We wanted to, but there was so much going on that we actually didn't. I kind of kept up to date on what was going on with the arena tournaments by looking on WoW Insider, like with my phone, which was kind of cool because I guess there was a huge upset this year, but it was, as far as I know, the area looked really cool, we got to walk by a few times.
7424000	7430000	Nice. Shahran, speaking of your phone, actually wants to know, how's your iPhone?
7430000	7441000	It freaking rocks, I guess. I don't know. It's okay. I'm kind of over the iPhone, actually. I keep on telling people that I might actually switch to a different phone in November.
7441000	7442000	Why?
7442000	7443000	I don't know.
7443000	7444000	Really?
7444000	7454000	It's high maintenance, you know, you have to constantly clean it, and I don't know, I'm always worried that the screen is going to get scratched.
7454000	7458000	Whatever, you're just talking smack about it because I finally bought one this week.
7458000	7462000	I know, and look at me trying to make you feel bad.
7462000	7467000	Last question, Dark Tetsuya wants to know if the Wizard was playable in Diablo 3.
7467000	7480000	It was, and I actually played the Wizard, and it was really fun. I was very impressed. Once again, having not ever played the game before, I was thoroughly impressed by it.
7480000	7492000	At least for anybody that hasn't played the game before, I definitely recommend it, and from what I hear, most fans of Diablo are definitely going to want to play this.
7492000	7503000	Alright, really quickly, then we're going to let you go, because this phone call is going on ten minutes, but I want to know, did you meet other, because it's a convention, it's a meet and meet people, did you meet any other funny people?
7503000	7508000	Were there some really weird ass people that you actually got to meet?
7508000	7517000	Well, there were weird ass people, but tell you the truth, Rob, I don't want to meet any of those weird fuckers.
7517000	7523000	Wasn't there somebody you were looking at from a distance going, that guy is, like, fucking weird?
7523000	7539000	Yeah, especially the people that ask questions on the panels, like, they're the best, they're like, I'm a nerd, and I'm like, did he even ask a question? I don't know, do they speak different languages? What the hell?
7539000	7547000	Alright, well, hey, Extrofer, we gotta let you go so we can get back to our show, but thanks for the report on Blizzcon, and maybe next year I can go.
7547000	7549000	Maybe, who knows?
7549000	7553000	We'll see, alright, well, take care, Extrofer, and come join us in the studio sometime.
7553000	7555000	Alright, I will, definitely.
7555000	7557000	Alright, later, dude.
7557000	7559000	Alright, bye.
7559000	7577000	Extrofer joining us, not live, from Blizzcon, but at least he was there, so he was able to give us a call, which, by the way, while Blizzcon was going on, some friends of mine, and me, held our own little convention called QQCon, for those of us that weren't able to get tickets to Blizzcon, so it was pretty awesome, actually.
7577000	7583000	We actually had goodie bags from QQCon, and one of the things we got was a little rabbit's foot for better luck next year, so there you have it.
7583000	7592000	Alright, let's move on and get to some more gaming news, and then we'll get to the Skype line so the rest of y'all can call in, and we'll start off Dark Sakura, going to a new game.
7592000	7600000	For anyone who is interested in Call of Duty, Call of Duty 5 is going into beta next week for Xbox 360.
7600000	7603000	Well, I should actually say, this week.
7603000	7610000	There will be some sources that are giving out beta codes, you just have to find them.
7610000	7614000	I just thought it was worth saying that Activision is starting testing now.
7614000	7619000	Cool. Kind of like last year, they did the same thing with Call of Duty 4.
7619000	7623000	I remember I got into the beta last year, we only played it a few times.
7623000	7629000	I know that Eurogamer is giving out beta codes, so for our friends overseas, you can find it there.
7629000	7633000	Yeah. Hmm. Very cool.
7633000	7640000	Anyways, let's see here. Something back to the music gaming topic here.
7640000	7647000	There's a brand new music game that's going to make some competition for Beatmania and Activision's new DJ hero.
7647000	7663000	That is Scratch, the ultimate DJ, being announced. It's kind of a partnership of both Newmark and hip-hop producer Quincy Jones III.
7663000	7669000	Genius Products is going to be distributing it, and Genco Interactive, I believe, is developing it.
7669000	7676000	The game itself is very similar to Beatmania, in fact the screen basically involves
7676000	7682000	five colored notes scrolling down the screen, and they've got a section where you can scratch as well.
7682000	7685000	There's going to be a controller that they're making for it.
7685000	7690000	Actually, Newark is making the controller, and overall, it looks pretty cool so far.
7690000	7698000	We'll have to see more of a song list and that kind of thing, but maybe set the bar a little bit high for a DJ hero whenever that comes out.
7698000	7700000	But this, I don't know, looks pretty cool.
7700000	7706000	ActDeft in chat gives a mandatory comment. Konami will sue! Will they? Yeah, they may.
7706000	7712000	They may sue, and you know what, that's pretty sad because their attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.
7712000	7716000	And this is J100Matt says, how can they not be sued for this?
7716000	7725000	Because the interface is different. I mean, it is a similar type of gameplay, but depends on how you play it.
7725000	7731000	I mean, it's just like how Guitar Hero is different enough to where they can't really sue.
7731000	7742000	Well, I guess, they license the rights for the guitars, but as far as the actual game itself, I don't think they have to license anything.
7742000	7751000	So, it's different enough, the way the notes come on the screen, because they kind of come out, it looks like there's a record that's playing that is spinning,
7751000	7756000	and then the notes come out of the spinning record and then scroll down the screen, like a conveyor belt.
7756000	7762000	FYI, VXChasingXV argues with you and says, Konami's attempt at Beatmania wasn't very good.
7762000	7766000	15 versions in Japan, their US attempt was great, it's just the wrong locale.
7766000	7772000	I'm talking about the US one, and yeah, it was alright, but what did they really do with it?
7772000	7780000	Nothing. So, you know what, if you're not going to do anything with your product that could probably sell very well,
7780000	7788000	much like Guitar Freaks was, then you deserve to be left in the dust, I guess.
7788000	7797000	Just like putting out a guitar game and a drum game years after everyone else has attempted it. Not probably a smart idea.
7797000	7803000	I reluctantly agree, I have no patience for Konami in the music game world anymore.
7803000	7805000	If they're not going to do it, someone else needs to beat them to it.
7805000	7810000	Although I thought Beatmania in the US was fine, it was alright.
7810000	7815000	Well, let's look at DDR. What exactly has changed in DDR lately? Not much.
7815000	7820000	How have they supported their games with downloadable content? Not very well.
7820000	7827000	I mean, the quest mode in that game, in the universe games have sucked,
7827000	7833000	and they don't really listen to their fanbase anymore, they just kind of do what they want because they're DDR and people will buy it.
7833000	7837000	Universe 3 looks kind of cool. People will buy it for a while.
7837000	7842000	Alright, speaking of DDR, there is another DDR game coming out.
7842000	7848000	It is Dance Dance Revolution Disney Grooves, and it's coming for the Wii.
7848000	7853000	It's what it sounds like, it's going to be 40 new Disney songs that are going to be coming to the Wii.
7853000	7859000	You know, the standard press release comes out with this, that apparently you can actually get your Mii in a Disney costume,
7859000	7861000	and that's what you can dance with in the game.
7861000	7869000	Apparently there will be some new modes too, like a groove world, where it basically just has achievements and you get costumes based on the achievement.
7869000	7879000	Now, what is also cool is the way the community actually tore apart the DDRX disc and found some extra song names on the disc.
7879000	7883000	There's like this master track list that's always in DDR games.
7883000	7886000	Ah yes, the master track list, and you would think by now that they would have learned.
7886000	7892000	Well, they hacked the master track list and they found a bunch of new songs on it, and guess what, they're all Disney songs.
7892000	7894000	So you can pretty much already tell what songs are going to be in this.
7894000	7907000	A Pirate's Life, Chim Chim Marie, Disney Carnival, Hakuna Matata, I Just Can't Wait To Be King, Mickey Mouse Club March, The Bare Necessities, Zippity Doodah,
7907000	7919000	and the most awesome Disney song of all time, The Tiki Room.
7919000	7924000	Come on, you could be able to dance to that, right? Can't you see yourself dancing to that?
7924000	7927000	Tell me the Tiki Room isn't the most awesome Disney song of all time.
7927000	7930000	The Tiki Room is the best place to go when it's hot.
7930000	7938000	The question is, why do you see a song called Ducks In The Hood? Don't ask.
7938000	7942000	I mean, Ducks In The Hood, really?
7942000	7947000	Well, those are some of the songs you have to look forward to. By the way, that wasn't the actual Tiki Room recording, that was just something I found.
7947000	7951000	It was actually the Tiki Room Macarena version, but it's very dancey.
7951000	7954000	Macarena's cool again, it's retinal occasionally.
7954000	7957000	Ice Mickey? Wow, Way To Be Current.
7957000	7963000	Alright, where's Macho Duck? What the fuck? I mean, seriously.
7963000	7965000	Let's move on with other awesome game news.
7965000	7971000	I have to actually make a comment about that. It better have freaking dance magic in it.
7971000	7974000	I haven't heard. We'll see.
7974000	7979000	Rob did have to give me a story that I'm going to completely not give a shit about.
7979000	7981000	What is that?
7981000	7990000	The fitty game, Blood On The Sand, is going to be published by THQ.
7990000	7996000	Activision farted on the idea and said, we don't want this pile of steaming shit.
7996000	8001000	So THQ said, wait, we like shit?
8001000	8008000	To be fair, it doesn't look bad. It's just over the top and with no base in reality whatsoever.
8008000	8013000	I mean, if they made Oscars for video games, this would so be nominated next year.
8013000	8016000	Well, it's coming out sometime.
8016000	8020000	Phew, rest easy. Thank you THQ for giving the gamers.
8020000	8023000	Thank you THQ for our fitty.
8023000	8030000	Well, I don't know, they have like 50 Cent and these games sell.
8030000	8032000	Exactly, it'll sell.
8032000	8034000	You'd be surprised.
8034000	8036000	You'd be surprised, I know, I know.
8036000	8041000	A couple more stories for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8041000	8049000	Well, the new Xbox Experience brand new update that's going to be coming to the Xbox 360 dashboard.
8049000	8052000	Everybody's been wondering, when the hell is this thing coming out?
8052000	8055000	Well, hopefully we have your answer now.
8055000	8062000	It was announced during Tokyo Game Show that it will be available to download on November 19th.
8062000	8066000	So that's when you get your brand new Xbox Experience.
8066000	8073000	The download will take up 128 megabytes of hard drive space or storage space.
8073000	8076000	People have been concerned and kind of in an uproar about,
8076000	8079000	Well, you know, why is it going to require space?
8079000	8082000	There are some 360s that are sold without storage.
8082000	8084000	Well, I correct you.
8084000	8089000	There are no Xbox 360s currently being sold without storage of any kind.
8089000	8094000	If you remember, the arcade systems do come with a 256 megabyte memory unit.
8094000	8102000	So you can still enjoy the next Xbox Experience, I guess.
8102000	8106000	And if you don't have a fucking memory card or hard drive, I mean, seriously, what the hell's wrong with you?
8106000	8108000	Just buy a hard drive.
8108000	8110000	Then you probably don't care about the new Xbox Experience either.
8110000	8113000	Honestly.
8113000	8118000	Although I do still think it was a mistake for Microsoft to just not put the hard drive with all the systems.
8118000	8120000	They wanted to drive the price down, whatever.
8120000	8123000	Whatever, I mean, it's fine.
8123000	8127000	The other thing that's rumored to be coming out on the 19th as well,
8127000	8133000	Well, apparently Home may be coming out that day as well to kind of counteract the whole new Xbox Experience.
8133000	8137000	And it makes perfect sense to me, because even if it's not done, they're going to release it anyways.
8137000	8140000	Because it's still in beta.
8140000	8143000	Yeah, beta. Awesome.
8143000	8147000	So yeah, expect that probably around the same time as well.
8147000	8151000	Alright. Are you looking forward to the new Xbox Experience? I think it looks pretty cool.
8151000	8153000	Yeah, don't really care.
8153000	8161000	There is one thing I'm looking forward to about it, is that they are going to add new 16x10 screen formats.
8161000	8172000	So, for example, if I'm playing on my monitor that's 1400x900, I can actually use the full screen now.
8172000	8180000	Because before it was kind of stretched a little bit, but now it'll actually be the no native resolution for widescreen monitors.
8180000	8181000	Cool.
8181000	8186000	Alright, one more story for you guys tonight, and then we are going to open up the Skype line.
8186000	8188000	And this is a pretty interesting story.
8188000	8191000	There is actually a study that has gone on out there.
8191000	8196000	It's a bisexual psychoth- actually, it's not so much a study more than it is just kind of a comment.
8196000	8201000	It's bisexual psychotherapist Paula Hall, and she said this to the BBC.
8201000	8211000	Apparently, according to this Paula Hall, she was actually doing this whole study on premature ejaculation was actually what the study was all about.
8211000	8213000	Yes, that's what I said, premature ejaculation.
8213000	8216000	And you might be thinking, what the hell does this have to do with video games?
8216000	8219000	Well, it's because of an interesting comment she actually said as a part of this.
8219000	8223000	Premature ejaculation is definitely not purely psychological.
8223000	8229000	These men with non-psychological premature ejaculation have very quick reflexes.
8229000	8234000	They may be excellent at playing tennis or computer games.
8234000	8243000	So apparently, according to this chick, there's some type of correlation between being a good gamer and finishing quickly in the bedroom.
8243000	8247000	Maybe it's because they're just waiting to get back to the game.
8247000	8248000	That doesn't make any sense.
8248000	8252000	I don't blame Paula Hall.
8252000	8255000	I don't know. That still doesn't make any sense.
8255000	8263000	Apparently, what they're trying to do with this whole thing, they're trying to actually make drugs to reduce the likelihood of premature ejaculation, like Viagra in reverse, I guess, a little bit.
8263000	8265000	Very interesting.
8265000	8269000	I wonder if this is a problem for women.
8269000	8270000	Premature ejaculation.
8270000	8271000	You know what?
8271000	8273000	What?
8273000	8277000	The problem for women is men.
8277000	8281000	Men are impatient.
8281000	8284000	Okay, I'm done. Back to the game. Thanks, lady.
8284000	8286000	You know what else is the problem too?
8286000	8287000	What?
8287000	8290000	Women keep nagging them when they're trying to play their games.
8290000	8292000	Honey, come to bed.
8292000	8296000	That's why God made toys.
8296000	8297000	All right.
8297000	8298000	Moving forward.
8298000	8300000	Yes, please. We're going to go to the Skype line.
8300000	8301000	We're going to go to our phones.
8301000	8305000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8305000	8307000	And hey, we've got a call on the line.
8307000	8310000	Hello, caller, are you there?
8310000	8311000	Yep.
8311000	8313000	Hey, who is this?
8313000	8314000	Hello, Rice Princess.
8314000	8318000	Hello, Rice Princess. How are you?
8318000	8320000	Oh, I'm okay. How are you?
8320000	8324000	I'm good. We're hearing from a lot of local OLR folks tonight,
8324000	8329000	because I don't know if you heard, but Ecstifer was on the show earlier talking about BlizzCon.
8329000	8332000	Oh, boo, BlizzCon.
8332000	8334000	Well, what did you call in to tell us about tonight?
8334000	8335000	I went to a CoolerCon.
8335000	8339000	Well, you went to a CoolerCon this week. Did you go to Tokyo Game Show?
8339000	8341000	No. Why would I go to that crap?
8341000	8346000	You went to a con that was cooler than Tokyo Game Show and BlizzCon combined?
8346000	8347000	Where did you go?
8347000	8350000	Yeah, I went to QQCon.
8350000	8354000	Awesome. QQCon. I went to QQCon, too. I think I saw you there.
8354000	8357000	I mean, there was a lot of people there, but I think I saw you in the crowd.
8357000	8361000	Yeah, I think I ran across you once or twice.
8361000	8367000	I think so. Tell the listeners something about QQCon, because I bet nobody's ever heard of QQCon.
8367000	8372000	But did you have something to do with the starting of QQCon?
8372000	8378000	No, it was actually organized by two of our friends, Mel and Eric.
8378000	8383000	But we just actually held it at our venue, aka our apartment.
8383000	8388000	And yeah, it's just awesome and free.
8388000	8394000	Free? That's awesome. Tell the listeners a little something about the idea behind QQCon.
8394000	8398000	Why was there a QQCon? What were we celebrating at QQCon?
8398000	8402000	Oh, okay. Well, you know how there was BlizzCon this weekend?
8402000	8410000	And a lot of us didn't get to go because they had this ridiculous lottery system to have to get tickets and stupid crap like that.
8410000	8413000	We just kind of had our own convention.
8413000	8418000	And it's the QQCon because, as we all know, QQ means crying in the game.
8418000	8421000	Because the QQs look like crying eyes.
8421000	8427000	So we were all just basically convening to cry about not going to BlizzCon.
8427000	8433000	Was there any cosplay at the tournament, or at the convention, as SSG100Matt?
8433000	8439000	There was no cosplay, but we all got swag in the form of Frostmourne.
8439000	8445000	And we all welded them and played around with them and stuff.
8445000	8447000	Does that count?
8447000	8450000	Will there be a QQCon next year?
8450000	8455000	Absolutely. There would be one every year from here on out.
8455000	8462000	I think what would be awesome is that even if the organizers were able to get into BlizzCon next year, there should still be a QQCon.
8462000	8467000	Because what is a convention without bitching about something that happened at the convention?
8467000	8471000	Of course. We would just have it in the hotel or something.
8471000	8476000	Exactly. So everybody's invited to the second annual QQCon next year.
8476000	8484000	We might have to find a larger venue according to how many people actually find up for next year's QQCon.
8484000	8486000	Well this is how these things start.
8486000	8487000	Yeah, we'll have to see about that.
8487000	8488000	Alright, sounds good.
8488000	8491000	Hey, any other video games you've been playing this week you want to tell our listeners about?
8491000	8494000	Um, no.
8494000	8497000	Well alright then.
8497000	8502000	I didn't play anything except for WarioWare at QQCon because it's the best con ever.
8502000	8504000	But that's pretty much it.
8504000	8507000	Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
8507000	8512000	Um, yeah, you have to poop at QQCon.
8512000	8513000	I had YYCon.
8513000	8514000	You did?
8514000	8515000	What's YYCon?
8515000	8519000	Why? Why? It means yay.
8519000	8523000	Yes, I did have to poop at QQCon.
8523000	8528000	It's going to be an event next year. Alright, I'm hanging up. This joke's gone on way too long.
8528000	8531000	Bye Rice Princess!
8531000	8532000	Bye.
8532000	8535000	Bye. Did she just poop in the phone? I think she did.
8535000	8537000	I don't think that was a poop. I think it was a fart.
8537000	8539000	1877 Game OLR.
8539000	8542000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8542000	8544000	Hi, this is Spaz.
8544000	8546000	Hey, what's up Spaz?
8546000	8552000	Uh, not much. Um, I just want to comment on something that you were saying earlier in the show.
8552000	8553000	Yes.
8553000	8558000	If I remember right, you were mentioning that you're considering playing PlayStation 3.
8558000	8560000	The what? I'm sorry?
8560000	8566000	If I remember right, you had mentioned that you're considering getting a PlayStation 3?
8566000	8572000	Yeah, I think it's past the point of consideration. I think it's going to happen. It's just a question of when.
8572000	8592000	Well, you know, I think that if you do get it, you'll really enjoy it. The only thing to bear in mind is that it would be a good idea to compare it to the 360 in any way.
8592000	8600000	Because it's kind of, in its own way, its own beast. If you try to compare it to the 360, you'll probably come off disappointed.
8600000	8608000	What kinds of cool things am I going to find on the PlayStation 3 that I'm not going to get on the Xbox 360, in your opinion?
8608000	8617000	Well, there's, as you probably know, there's not a whole lot of system exclusives in terms of games.
8617000	8630000	But what few there are, I think you may like stuff like Solcom, Warhawk, some of the downloadable original PlayStation 1 games.
8630000	8639000	They do have some interactive art there. In fact, I was just talking about one with Bobby Blackwell on his show.
8639000	8647000	And the most recent one is kind of weird, but it's still interesting nonetheless.
8647000	8658000	And then, of course, there's the whole Pixeljunk series of games, including Pixeljunk Monsters, which is kind of like a tower defense game, which is pretty fun.
8658000	8666000	I could go on and on in terms of games, but I don't want to take up too much time on the show.
8666000	8684000	And plus, there's one benefit to the PlayStation 3's video store that the 360 doesn't do all well, in the sense that with the 360, you can only rent the movies,
8684000	8690000	whereas the PlayStation 3 gives you the choice between renting or outright buying.
8690000	8705000	Some people are kind of against renting, they would really buy, because once you see the movie, you're basically out a couple bucks,
8705000	8714000	whereas if you're outright buying the movie, you can't watch it as many times as you want whenever you want.
8714000	8721000	Well, but doesn't the PlayStation 3 kind of do both? Don't they have Blu-ray and a download service now?
8721000	8737000	Yeah, that's absolutely right. Basically, you have a choice. Blu-ray is a little bit more expensive, but at the same time, you get all the extras.
8737000	8745000	It's in high-def, and since it's on the desk, it won't take up any space on your hard drive.
8745000	8762000	Whereas if you buy from the download service, you won't get the extras, and if you buy the movies, they'll be in standard definition, but you'll get a cheaper price point.
8762000	8768000	Fair enough, but Blu-rays are kind of expensive. I mean, you have to really like a movie in order to want to get it on Blu-ray.
8768000	8772000	You know what I mean? They're like 24 bucks a pop. That's a lot more than a rental.
8772000	8783000	Well, actually, it may be 24 bucks in and around the area, but at least in my area, which is western New York,
8783000	8789000	they're closer to, on the cheap end, like 30 bucks, and as high as 35.
8789000	8794000	Hey, speaking of high-def movies, I was just in the house because I had to run and make a potty break while another story was going on.
8794000	8799000	They're actually using the HD DVD player right now. They're watching Stardust, which I love that movie.
8799000	8806000	Anyway, sorry, just kind of a random tangent, but hey, that movie was actually pretty cheap because HD DVD had already bit the dust at that point when I got that.
8806000	8811000	Question from Frisbee in chat, and this will be the last one, and then we're going to get to one more call before we end the show tonight.
8811000	8815000	Frisbee wants to know, is Blu-ray really that good?
8815000	8843000	Well, in my opinion, yes. To give an analogy in terms of games, it's kind of like trying to play Halo 3 as opposed to the original NES version of Washington Attack.
8843000	8850000	And that's in terms of graphics, not in terms of fun or anything like that.
8850000	8859000	Halo 3 is at least a balance better than Washington Attack in terms of graphics.
8859000	8866000	I think a big part of it, too, is that it's kind of like watching HDTV for the first time compared to regular TV.
8866000	8876000	I mean, true DVDs are a little slightly better than regular TV, like the old TVs, because they can do interlaced, but it's a big step.
8876000	8881000	Well, anyway, Spaz, we've got to wrap up, but do you have any quick last thoughts for our listeners?
8881000	8895000	Oh, yeah. Obviously, I can't do it now, but probably during the week if you like, I can send you an email with a list of recommended games and whatnot that gives me joy.
8895000	8898000	I'll always take a look, Spaz. You can email that to me anytime.
8898000	8900000	Sure. Have a good one.
8900000	8902000	All right, you have a good one. Take care, buddy.
8902000	8903000	All right, you too. Bye-bye.
8903000	8908000	Bye-bye. We'll do one more call here on the Skyline 1877 Game OLR.
8908000	8910000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8910000	8917000	Hello, Orange Lounge Radio Land. It is he who is very uncreative and can't think of a way of describing himself tonight.
8917000	8918000	How about you just call yourself Jason?
8918000	8920000	Yeah, that works, too. Hey, guys, it's Jason.
8920000	8921000	Hey, how you doing?
8921000	8928000	Hey, it's so funny. You can totally tell the difference between the telephone calls and the Skype calls. The Skype calls really are pretty clear.
8928000	8930000	The Internet takes off for phones pretty soon.
8930000	8932000	That's all right. Hey, what's on your mind, Jason?
8932000	8940000	I don't remember all of the details specifically. I was driving into work and my iPhone tuner app was cutting out, so I didn't get all of the conversation.
8940000	8946000	Oh, my God. I keep forgetting that people can actually listen to this show in the car now because of Edge. That is nuts.
8946000	8955000	We plug it straight into the car stereo and when 3G decides to actually work properly, I can just be listening to whatever I want, in this case, the show.
8955000	8963000	That is amazing. Technology has come so far. You're going to have to tell me how you do that. I don't know if you're looking at Justin.TV. I just finally picked up the iPhone this week.
8963000	8970000	All I have is Twitterrific and I got Tap Tap Revolution or whatever it's called, Tap Tap Mania.
8970000	8972000	It's a terrible game.
8972000	8973000	Yeah, it's a little stupid.
8973000	8974000	I hated that game.
8974000	8984000	The frame rate, well, it's free. I can't complain about free. But what's weird is that it's what they advertise in the Apple store on the big banners, which I thought was interesting.
8984000	8988000	I'll complain about free. Yars sucked and so does Tap Tap Revenge.
8988000	8997000	All right, sorry. Brad is sending me a private message for the tuner app. I'm going to definitely have to check that out. Wow. Man, it blows my mind how far technology has come.
8997000	8999000	I don't like tuner.
8999000	9001000	Is there other ones that are good?
9001000	9006000	I've actually just been using AOL radio to listen to the comedy channel.
9006000	9008000	But you can't hear us on there.
9008000	9012000	But tuner for a while stopped picking us up. Actually, they limited all the stations.
9012000	9016000	And so correct me if I'm wrong, this is all free. It's not going to cost me extra money on the AT&T daily.
9016000	9018000	Tuner costs. AOL radio is free.
9018000	9021000	But I mean, the bit rate, the data, the bandwidth is free.
9021000	9022000	They shouldn't.
9022000	9024000	Oh my god, that's amazing.
9024000	9028000	The iPhones only sell unlimited data plans, right?
9028000	9030000	Yeah, they do. It just blows my mind though.
9030000	9032000	And it can be used for the application or the service.
9032000	9033000	It just blows my mind.
9033000	9035000	It's just your phone streaming the station.
9035000	9039000	Wow. Anyhow, sorry. I'm going to have to try that later.
9039000	9042000	It just blows my mind that somebody could be actually listening to us in the car right now.
9042000	9045000	Seven years ago, when we only had twelve listeners, I never thought that possible.
9045000	9053000	But we really are starting to reach that day and age where you will be able to listen to us like an over the air wave show.
9053000	9057000	We're there. It's just not many people are doing it. It's crazy.
9057000	9062000	If Sprint actually kicks into high gear and really gets WiMAX everywhere, then it's going to be a really good day.
9062000	9070000	Because then PSPs and all of the other non-cellular network but wireless capable devices are going to be able to do the same thing just about anywhere.
9070000	9073000	Anyway, I'm sorry. You probably didn't call in to talk about Tuner.
9073000	9077000	Oh, I don't care. I love technology. Are you kidding me? If you guys were a tech show, I'd be on here all the time.
9077000	9082000	Let me guess. You probably had something to say about the beat and groovy or beat meaning.
9082000	9084000	Because we've been talking a lot about music games tonight.
9084000	9086000	Beat and groovy is a joke.
9086000	9089000	I was going to say two things. That was going to be the shorter of two things.
9089000	9092000	I reiterate what I said before, but I make it worse.
9092000	9095000	Konami needs to stop releasing in America.
9095000	9100000	They're not going to hold a candle to what every other company has now done.
9100000	9109000	And while I think Scratch looks really terrible, it's probably going to perform better, look better, and work better than BeatMania US, quite unfortunately.
9109000	9112000	And it's probably going to do better because of the music choice.
9112000	9115000	They never should have closed Hawaii.
9115000	9117000	And they never should have moved Konami SoCal.
9117000	9118000	Nope.
9118000	9120000	Or NorCal, whichever.
9120000	9126000	And a lot of us gave Konami Hawaii a lot of shit when that first DDR game came out on Xbox, but boy did the second one shut us all up.
9126000	9130000	It seemed like they, more than any other division, were really listening to people.
9130000	9133000	I thought we gave them shit because they released DDRPC.
9133000	9139000	But without DDRPC, we would have never had Mr. Spanky. So, case in point.
9139000	9144000	Anyhow, sorry. What else besides beat and groovy? Beat and yucky.
9144000	9149000	Both of you and Loki were pretty wrong on StarCraft II.
9149000	9157000	The way that they're veiling this, if I'm understanding correctly, I'm seeing two sides to the story, but neither of your opinions matched it.
9157000	9159000	So here's my take.
9159000	9170000	The release date is, I don't know if this has actually been mentioned, but the release date for the three StarCraft IIs is probably going to be on the same day or very, very close together, isn't it?
9170000	9175000	I haven't the clue. I didn't follow BlizzCon that closely, but okay.
9175000	9180000	I don't think it's been announced. It's just the fact that it's going to be a trilogy and that's what everybody's going over.
9180000	9190000	The same thing that Bobby was saying, and I'll do it in the same way as him, you're going to buy one game three times, you're going to buy one game three times, and you will buy one game three times.
9190000	9197000	He's absolutely correct. They are going to take one game, give the same features on all three to play with other people.
9197000	9200000	That's a good feature. I'm glad they're doing that.
9200000	9205000	But the campaigns that they're splitting that up like that is pretty annoying.
9205000	9212000	I'm hoping they... PC games, mainstream PC games come out at like $40 or $50, don't they?
9212000	9214000	Yeah, that's about right.
9214000	9216000	I don't play PC games anymore.
9216000	9218000	Spore was $49, right?
9218000	9219000	Yeah.
9219000	9225000	$49.99 for Spore. The price tags... I still have the box here and the price tag still on there, so I would expect that's the price you're going to...
9225000	9229000	You can't see that on Justin. I would expect that's the price you're going to pay for StarCraft.
9229000	9242000	I'm hoping and assuming that they're going to make it a little bit cheaper, because $150 just to play a game that presumably you'll want to complete, paying $150 is going to be excessive.
9242000	9248000	And I'm really hoping that each game is going to be... $25 and $30 even makes it a little bit better.
9248000	9253000	Cheaper than that would be great, but I'm seriously hoping that all three do not come out at $50 apiece.
9253000	9261000	But if one does multiplayer... I mean, there's a bunch of people that only play StarCraft for multiplayer. I mean, the hell with single player.
9261000	9269000	As a matter of fact, this is the funny thing. A couple of months ago, I finally got StarCraft to work on OSX. I have a MacBook Pro, by the way.
9269000	9270000	Yay!
9270000	9278000	Anyways, I finally got StarCraft to work on my Mac, and I've been playing through it. I've been playing the campaign and nothing else.
9278000	9285000	The real rub is I'm playing without cheats, because I've never done that. But I'm playing through the campaigns and nothing else.
9285000	9289000	Especially now that StarCraft II is coming out, I want to keep doing that.
9289000	9298000	And all three of the races, I don't prefer the Terrans, but that doesn't mean I don't want to play their campaign.
9298000	9304000	The story in the first one was magnificent, and I want to play that the whole way through.
9304000	9307000	Probably multiple times based off what I'm hearing they're doing.
9307000	9313000	I'm very curious to see, because Blizzard's pretty in tune with their fanbase. I'm very curious to see how they kind of respond to the negativity.
9313000	9316000	Because you know they will this week. We'll have a follow-up on this.
9316000	9321000	I'm really hoping that they do it for cheaper, because it would make sense, and they're very good at that.
9321000	9326000	Alright. Well, Jason, we've got to wrap up and get the show on out of here, but do you have any last thoughts?
9326000	9332000	Your Netflix achievement was hilarious, and I want to see it happen.
9332000	9336000	Thank you. And if you have no idea what we're talking about, you'll have to listen to Bobby's show. So there's a plug for Bobby.
9336000	9340000	There's a plug for Bobby. Do it. Call GameStop on iTunes. Podcast.
9340000	9366000	And while you're there, leave us a nice review too. By the way, I've got to say, speaking of the iTunes reviews, and if you don't already know, you can leave reviews on iTunes, and it really helps in the ranking of the show, and it gets it a little higher in the list the more people find us. It helps spread the word.
9366000	9375000	The only name I've seen around is Let's Have Tea. It would fit. And they say, I've been listening to orange on the radio for a few years now, and still today, I've yet to find a podcast that's nearly the same feel as OLR does.
9375000	9383000	After a few episodes, you'll begin to feel like these people are your friends, rather than your entertainers. Half of that is because the show is made up of three people who are good friends outside the show.
9383000	9392000	Aww. Doesn't that give you warm fuzzies all over? Make you a little nauseous? Aww. So anyway, sorry. We love the positive reviews.
9392000	9400000	Absolutely. All right. Jason, we've got to let you go to wrap up, okay? Bye-bye. I don't think you can hear me.
9400000	9410000	Guys. Oh, see you. Bye. That was kind of an awkward end. All right. Yeah. The Rob D says, gives you warm fuzzies until someone's outside your door asking to hang out.
9410000	9419000	Well, that's why we always say that, hey, we're based out of Sacramento, but that's about all we tell you. It's a big place. Over a million people.
9419000	9425000	All right. Anyhow, hey, we've got to wrap up the show. It's that time. Before we wrap up, though, some quick last minute stories.
9425000	9429000	I actually want to start tonight. Tiger Claw sent me this link, and I thought it was pretty funny.
9429000	9435000	Microsoft is suing DHL. You know who DHL is? They're kind of like FedEx, UPS, but they're like number three, I think.
9435000	9436000	Where they hire convicts.
9436000	9443000	Well, here's the thing. Well, apparently it's come to a head there, because DHL lost 21,600 Xbox consoles.
9443000	9444000	Damn.
9444000	9449000	Well, here's the thing. A train derailed in Texas. So because of the train derailment.
9449000	9451000	It derailed right into my garage.
9451000	9457000	This is everything. Again, this is coming from a lawsuit. It's been filed in Seattle, of course. That's where Microsoft's based.
9457000	9465000	Two million dollars in damages from DHL is what they want. It's because of two containers of Xbox consoles that had impact damage, wedding, pilfering, and storage.
9465000	9469000	And the train derailed around Duke, Texas. So suddenly there's tons of Xbox users in Texas.
9469000	9471000	If only it were Duke Nukem, Texas.
9471000	9478000	By the way, this happened on October 13, 2007. So it was quite some time ago, but the legal stuff is slow right now.
9478000	9480000	So there you have it.
9480000	9484000	By the way, usually you would just go, well, it's an accident. Why are they being so mean?
9484000	9492000	Nope. They are saying in the lawsuit that a DHL has not compensated it for the loss and that the delivery service, again, according to the lawsuit, quote,
9492000	9504000	negligently breached its duties as a common carrier, handler, bailey, warehouseman, agent, or in its other capabilities.
9504000	9508000	So they're basically saying, you done fucked up and ruined all our Xboxes because of it.
9508000	9511000	And so that's why they were so short on Xboxes a year ago.
9511000	9513000	There you have it.
9513000	9523000	Anyhow, the Rob D. speaks up in chat and says, someone wet on two containers of 360 controllers, keep those 360s out of the bathroom.
9523000	9530000	I knew that was a bad idea. I think when they fell out of the train, they got in the rain in Spain on the plane.
9530000	9533000	Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?
9533000	9535000	Yes, I do, actually. Sure, what's up?
9535000	9538000	Alright, a bunch of interesting stuff.
9538000	9547000	First off, XNA games are showing up on Xbox Live, apparently now. I have yet to go actually check this out, but apparently they started launching them.
9547000	9554000	I think that's what the last update was, remember? They had a live down for a day or so and they were tweaking some shit.
9554000	9555000	Alright.
9555000	9563000	But anyways, apparently there are some errors popping up right now, but it says there's two titles seem to be unplayable to average users.
9563000	9569000	With XNA Creators Club launcher errors popping up even if you have the program installed.
9569000	9578000	I don't know, so maybe it's something coming, but apparently they had both a free demo and the full versions priced at 100 Microsoft points.
9578000	9581000	100 Microsoft points ain't a lot.
9581000	9600000	Shown at Tokyo Game Show, Noby Noby Boy, which has the most weird video I've ever seen. It's basically, I don't even know how to describe the gameplay, but it has a really crazy song that fits in with Katamari Damacy.
9600000	9610000	Definitely check out the video, it's weird. I don't even know what this is. It's gotta be a Playstation Network title because it looks too simple for an actual full release game.
9610000	9620000	Left 4 Dead, the demo has been confirmed to be coming out early November, so that'll be fun to check out on Xbox 360 and PC.
9620000	9634000	Also, another demo that's been kind of confirmed, Mirror's Edge, apparently coming November 6th. This has actually been revealed via GameStop's website because on their little bonus offer thing there it says,
9634000	9640000	on a special note, Mirror's Edge demo will be available for download November 6th. Interesting.
9640000	9647000	Lots of Xbox Live Arcade games announced at Tokyo Game Show, lots and lots and lots of stuff.
9647000	9655000	King of Fighters 98, there's gonna be a brand new Arkanoid game coming to live.
9655000	9660000	Oh yeah, and the Space Invaders game, I'm so excited about the Space Invaders game, seriously.
9660000	9668000	Space Invaders Extreme. Joining that will be Metal Slug 7, the game that was supposedly only for the DS.
9668000	9679000	A brand new R-Type game, R-Type Dimensions, which looks pretty awesome, and like I said before, King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match will be coming as well.
9679000	9685000	And no word exactly on when, but man, there's a lot of good stuff in the tubes here.
9685000	9693000	Let's talk more about R-Type. R-Type Dimensions is actually going to be recreating R-Type 1 and 2, so that's pretty cool.
9693000	9704000	Other games coming out, Dodon Pachi, and I guess that came out in Japan only, but I don't even know if that's an Xbox Live Arcade game.
9704000	9716000	Oh man, they have some screens for the new R-Type game, looks awesome. Awesome, awesome. And let's see, I know I've got a lot more here, sorry.
9716000	9726000	There's a new t-shirt that was shown at Tokyo Game Show for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. Pretty cool, I think Jimmy would like that.
9726000	9738000	What was I going to say here? I gave Rob a video for this. They announced, remember that Rock Band reality show?
9738000	9747000	Well apparently, Rock Band To The Stars will be premiering on VH1 Classic this month, and there's a little promo video for it.
9747000	9756000	Not really sure what it is, but it says, on October 15th, VH1 Classic will premiere a new reality show called Rock Band To The Stars.
9756000	9768000	It will feature Alice Cooper and Sebastian Bach as they play host to 12 wannabe rockers as they live in a mansion and compete in different Rock Band 2 competitions.
9768000	9770000	Here you go, courtesy of EW.com.
9770000	9774000	Welcome to Rock Band To The Stars. This is about Rock Band 2.
9774000	9784000	Two legendary frontman, Sebastian Bach and Alice Cooper, will choose their ultimate Rock Band bands from a pool of 15 rabid Rock Band masters.
9784000	9794000	Each week, the players will face grueling challenges and painful eliminations to find out who rules in all things Rock Band 2.
9794000	9800000	Rock Band To The Stars premieres this Wednesday during jumpstart videos, only on VH1.
9800000	9808000	Looks a little silly. Looks very low budget. Very, very low budget. What does TV come to?
9808000	9810000	I don't know.
9810000	9812000	I get it. It's a little play on words there.
9812000	9818000	Yeah. Another funny thing, you know how they have in-game advertising for different things.
9818000	9826000	EA has a lot of it. Well, Burnout Paradise apparently has Barack Obama banners now on their billboards.
9826000	9829000	Very interesting advertising, by the way.
9829000	9837000	And apparently there's a rumor that IGN let slip a new Wii channel. I think we may have talked about this briefly last week.
9837000	9839000	You know how there was that Bandbrothers DX channel?
9839000	9844000	Well, they're saying that maybe there's a new channel coming out for Guitar Hero to use your DS on the Wii.
9844000	9847000	So it's kind of similar to that, but with Guitar Hero.
9847000	9849000	Huh. That's kind of cool.
9849000	9861000	And then, let's see here. One thing I thought would be funny to mention, Rob, there's a video advertising Dookapon Kingdom.
9861000	9867000	And the one thing that they do show advertised on there is they name their character Sassy Pants.
9867000	9869000	Awesome! What game was this?
9869000	9871000	Dookapon Kingdom.
9871000	9874000	They took it from me. That's my WoW character name, by the way. Sassy Pants.
9874000	9877000	And that's it.
9877000	9880000	Dark Sakura? Anything on your neck of the woods?
9880000	9881000	No.
9881000	9889000	Alright. Oh, we just got this in. Late-breaking news. This is kind of a follow-up to the whole DHL and Microsoft thing going on.
9889000	9909000	Well, DHL has released its defense as to why all the Xboxes got wet.
9909000	9919000	Gotta blame it on something, guys.
9919000	9925000	Come on, Microsoft.
9925000	9929000	Don't put the blame on us, Microsoft.
9929000	9932000	It's not like we got out the hose.
9932000	9935000	Why can't they just own up to it, okay?
9935000	9938000	No, this is so stupid.
9938000	9953000	I don't give a shit. Whatever their fucking reason is, while it's in their hands, it's in their care, therefore their responsibility, you fucking own up.
9953000	9957000	Whatever.
9957000	9961000	And you know what Microsoft would say to you, Dark Sakura?
9961000	9969000	Girl, you know it's true. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
9969000	9973000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so you can put the nail in the coffin of this program.
9973000	9975000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
9975000	9982000	My final thought is lots of games to play, and there's a lot more coming.
9982000	9984000	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?
9984000	9985000	Meh.
9985000	9988000	My final thought tonight is peanut butter.
9988000	9991000	And that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
9991000	9994000	Hey, thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent podcasting.
