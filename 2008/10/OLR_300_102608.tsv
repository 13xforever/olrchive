208	969	Votants!
3431	5592	Ready your breakfast and eat hearty.
6773	9956	For tonight, we dine in hell!
26954	34649	2008, E3 as we remember it is coming back, has PlayStation Home been hacked, and zombies are invading some of our favorite games.
45011	47053	And it's episode number 300 here in studio.
47574	48374	Can you believe it?
48915	51958	And there's just a crap ton of people here in house.
52018	52739	It's amazing.
52779	57484	I think the neighbors are going to call thinking that we're getting broken into or raped or something.
57524	57604	Orgy!
57664	58124	Orgy!
58244	58685	We are the...
60406	61006	Excuse me.
61026	62467	How many of us are not wearing shoes?
62527	63027	Officer.
63287	63707	Officer.
64048	66788	I think there's an orgy going on next door.
66829	68929	We are officially a Mississippi orgy.
68949	70770	They have a no on eight sign in front of their house.
70830	73751	It's a gay orgy going on in our neighborhood.
74091	74351	Hi.
75252	75472	Rob.
75792	76472	Orange Laundry.
77132	77312	What?
77933	78293	I'm sorry.
78333	81114	That was the most gay I've ever heard you sound ever.
82185	83165	Not me, where have you been?
83526	93289	Believe it or not, we're a podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, and it is just madness tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio in the studio.
93329	98251	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
98571	99091	Woo!
99292	99692	How you doing?
99932	100172	Woo!
101612	104654	and also say hello to what?
105214	107855	Say hello to Sackboy Loki!
108135	111396	Hello!
112957	114777	I'm sorry, the visuals for this are just too much.
115157	120880	If you're watching tonight on Justed TV, Loki is actually wearing a ginormous Sackboy costume.
120900	123561	That's right, he's finally dressed up for the listeners.
123601	124501	We're very excited.
124901	127542	Unfortunately, it's not Tingle, but he is wearing a Sackboy costume.
127822	132424	So if he sounds a little muffled, that's because the microphone is like inside the Sackboy costume.
132964	133384	I'm sorry.
133404	134565	And not in a dirty way.
134885	135085	Yes.
137926	140568	That would give a whole new meaning to talking out of his ass.
140608	146590	This is horrible radio, but the visual of it is just way too funny because Sackboy's mouth doesn't move.
147110	150272	That's why people need to be watching Justin TV.
150332	150692	Hello.
151789	153069	I'm sorry, podcast listeners.
153109	155370	I guess this one just isn't going to make much sense to you.
155790	158311	Also joining us tonight... They can go on Justin.TV and check the highlights.
158711	161311	That's right, because I know the listeners are highlighting this on Justin.TV.
161351	162952	Our username is OrangeLoungeRadio.
163312	163772	All one word.
163972	165652	We have a lot of guests here in the studio tonight.
165672	167093	Some new faces and some old faces.
167133	171494	I want to quickly introduce folks, because you might just... I guess we have introduction music.
171514	173474	Awesome.
173514	174935	Thank you, program.
176295	176695	Hey, look.
176735	178996	What show would it be without a technical fuck-up, right?
179036	179936	In the first five minutes.
182002	184203	Anyhow, say hello to some of our guests tonight.
184243	189726	Joining us, representing the women here, holding it down with DarkSakura, say hello to Mel!
190006	190527	Hello!
190867	193408	Hi Mel, you can grab the mic, it's okay, it won't bite unless you ask.
193568	193889	How are you?
194309	194629	I'm good.
194949	195089	Good.
195449	198231	I don't think you've been on the show before, if it has been a long, long time.
198451	199472	No, I haven't been on the show before.
199512	201193	Alright, so quickly, what kind of games do you like to play?
202628	203889	A lot of shit on my DS.
204229	204810	Alright, there you go.
205651	206672	Nintendo DS fangirl.
206952	211456	Alright, also joining us tonight, a very familiar face from the past, say hello to Drew Nami.
211916	212437	Madness?
212457	215479	This is Orange Lounge!
216260	217581	Now the cops are really going to get called.
222145	223667	Say hello as well to The Doctor.
224047	224788	I'm The Doctor.
225068	225408	How you doing?
225428	225929	And it's 300 shows!
226049	226729	And I'm naked!
230854	231435	Really?
232475	233877	And you're on camera.
234277	240122	Say hello as well to a person who has not been here in a long time.
240142	241363	When was the last time you were here?
242143	243565	Oh, two or three years ago.
243765	245506	Say hello to Arcadian42.
245927	249690	Yes, a dark shadow from the past returns for destruction.
252512	255613	And what kind of, since you haven't been on the show in so long, what kind of games do you like?
256073	257994	I like Adventure.
258914	260215	Sega, Sega, and more Sega.
260275	260835	Yes, Sega.
261195	262796	I haven't played some Sega games in a while.
263156	268578	But I have loads of Saturn games and Genesis and all that kind of stuff.
268758	271139	And when he grows up, he wants to be Sega Tassanchiro.
271339	274760	His house really is like a Sega museum, I just want to point out.
274820	275480	It's pretty awesome.
275921	278241	Alright, is this gentleman going to introduce himself too?
278642	279122	And you are?
280142	280602	Hiccup Boy.
280842	281383	Hiccup Boy?
281423	282183	Is that your online name?
283176	283617	Sometimes.
283737	284378	All right, there you go.
284458	284978	Hiccup Boy.
286039	287561	What kind of games are you into, Hiccup Boy?
288021	289683	RPG and first-person shooter.
289803	291484	What's the best RPG of all time?
291765	291965	Ever?
291985	294227	I'm going to have to go with Final Fantasy VII.
294507	295128	Get out of my house.
295328	296770	Final Fantasy VI, way better.
296870	297550	Get out of my house.
297570	298952	I'm just kidding.
298992	299532	What about points?
299552	300313	Can I go with 9?
300353	301214	9 runs number 2.
301654	302295	9 is pretty good.
303396	304097	It's all right.
304137	304757	At least you didn't say 11.
305458	305738	All right.
306659	307240	No me gusta.
308260	309281	All right, no, I'm just kidding.
309361	312623	We like having a variety of opinions here in the studio, even when they're wrong.
313023	314965	Hey, let's welcome the chat as well.
315025	319808	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, joining us as they do every week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
319828	322610	If it's your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, pardon the madness.
322670	323650	It's a little crazy tonight.
323710	330195	But yes, we started this show on June 23, 2002 on our live 365 feed.
330535	336159	And here we are six and a half years later on All Games Radio with our 300th episode.
336219	337900	So a big thank you.
338220	339741	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
367849	369030	It was a big fable.
370551	380978	I didn't do much playing in it, however Dan did, and he's been throwing fire at people and showing off his trophy, which I think is entirely, and flipping everyone off, which is just the best ever.
381618	386481	His guy looks kind of like a gorilla, with a red coat, and it's kind of cool.
387162	392285	And I've decided that when I play Fable 2, I'm going to make the biggest raging lesbian ever.
392665	394587	You're still a chicken chaser, you chase chickens.
395578	396601	I've, okay.
397643	403737	And, but he had to do the thing where he had to wear dreads and mutton chops and the dress and they said it was the wrong dress.
404557	405317	And that was kind of funny.
405617	407858	And I've been playing Ragnarok, of course.
409018	412019	And I got my DS, finally.
412759	413759	However, it's not here.
413819	414179	It's at home.
414219	415499	But Dan got me a black DS.
416759	419800	Much, very similar to Melchon's black DS.
420640	421280	You have a blue one.
421340	423501	Except Melchon has like a little Star Wars thing on it.
423521	424141	It's pretty neat.
424701	425461	Little stickers.
425781	429682	I could totally bust out my Miyamoto stickers, though, from E3 a few years ago.
430462	432383	But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.
433423	434103	Yes, I have a nice one.
434508	436593	I babysat yesterday too Really?
436934	438398	Yes Did you play any games with the baby?
439220	443831	We went to the jungle gym and played Let's Splash All of the Water in the Fountain
445249	464558	and um baby's gonna slide down whether you're at the bottom to catch him or not and let's see how many times catch the baby and it was also let's let's see how often Julian will run back to the swings and beg to be in it only to not do anything but look at the other children
465339	491429	I think the Orange Lounge Radio official game should be something a lot like WarioWare where all the little micro games are like little in-jokes from the show and there should be one where DarkSakura is there with a big net and it says catch and babies start falling and there's babies falling from the sky I do have to say he's such a good kid that he's the reason why I'm no longer afraid of most babies in small numbers, namely one do you want to eat them like Shane?
492347	492547	No.
493408	495249	Shane has subscriptions.
496711	498712	We heart you, Shane, but you've got subscriptions.
498752	499413	He's not listening.
499433	500113	He hates this show.
500794	502175	Well, he hates everything that he likes.
503896	504537	Anything else?
505278	506278	High School Musical!
506599	507039	Oh, Lord.
507059	508840	My God!
508920	509441	You're cut off.
509661	510302	No, no, no.
510482	513784	Loki, Sackboy, SackLoki, how was your gaming week?
514105	515186	I didn't play that much this week.
515326	517668	Mainly, I played LittleBigPlanet.
518629	519149	I love that game.
520410	525173	It's actually... I'm now in the Japanese level, which is pretty cool.
525213	535800	So I'm dressed up like a ninja, and I've got a... I'm a ninja pirate, because I'm wearing the ninja head, and I've got the pirate outfit, and I'm carrying a frying pan.
535960	536640	So that's awesome.
536880	538882	And how is Everyone's a Little Bit Racist the game?
540515	544596	Pretty good, but apparently it's not going to be as racist soon.
546336	547557	No, I mean, come on.
547617	548017	It was ridiculous.
548037	550277	We were looking at it on Justin.TV last week after the show.
550297	551978	It's like a little present for our live listeners.
552038	557679	And we saw a bunch of like, you know, the Africa level is all the Africa stereotypes.
557799	560899	And, you know, the South America level is all those stereotypes.
561040	564040	And, you know, the America level was hot dogs and cheeseburgers.
564780	567201	No, actually it was race cars and jazz.
567381	567621	Oh, yeah.
568101	568601	There you go.
568641	569181	Wait, wait, wait.
569421	571442	If you got them out of Casgar, will they shut down everything?
571462	574322	I don't know.
574482	580884	Now, I'm glad, though, when they did fix the song, that they didn't actually remove it from the game.
580904	583224	They just edited out the lyrics, which is awesome.
583384	584704	Because the song itself is awesome.
585044	587105	And to be honest, if the lyrics aren't in there, I'm not sad.
587345	588545	So, whatever.
588725	592586	But other than that, I've been playing Saints Row 2 multiplayer, because that's fun.
593266	593986	Still glitchy.
594246	595807	In fact, we found a new trick now.
595847	599227	Apparently, if you throw satchel charges on people, because you can actually stick them to other players.
599687	609989	If I, for example, stick multiple satchel charges on them, when they respawn, they still have the ones that haven't exploded yet, so you can detonate them again and kill them again, which is kind of a boo-boo there.
610789	614310	And then, oddly enough, I've been watching someone play Fable.
614770	616631	Can you guess who was playing Fable 2?
616991	617531	Harvey.
617551	618331	My wife.
619119	619900	is playing Fable 2.
619940	622882	Wait, your wife, the game hater, is playing Fable 2.
623262	624302	Yeah, she's playing Fable 2.
625003	625743	Here's how it happened.
626004	632308	She saw the commercial for it that they have now where the guy's playing with the little, I forget what you call those things.
632488	632768	Balls?
633148	633769	No, not balls.
634980	635980	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
664910	665211	I don't know.
672987	674768	She's all, yeah, set it up for me.
674848	676929	So I set it up for her, kind of helped her walk through it.
676949	678370	Now she's way further in the game than I am.
678650	681011	But granted, I've only played the game for like less than an hour.
681151	687415	So, you know, but she was like literally when I was leaving today to go finish my costume before I came over here.
687735	691977	She was just like, okay, I got to quit in like half an hour because I have to go to the gym.
692317	695559	And she's just seriously contemplating not going to the gym to play the game.
696779	697020	Nice.
698460	698680	Yeah.
698881	698981	Wow.
699001	699721	Just getting to that point.
701356	703017	I know it brings back memories of Final Fantasy XI.
704997	706097	I know, a proud gamer moment.
706137	707598	Are you a proud gaming husband now?
709138	714900	I don't think she's going to get bored of it because she's not paying attention to any of the storyline or any of what's supposed to be going on.
714920	717500	She's like, kill, kill, die, die, die, kill, kill, die, die, die.
717520	722061	It keeps giving her helpful hints like, you know, her life is slow, you should go find an inn or some potion.
722081	723722	She's like, I don't know where the hell the inn is!
724202	725442	I'm like, go to one of the towns!
725482	727563	She's like, I went to the towns, there's no inns there!
728573	729174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
747373	748014	Stuff like that.
748314	749555	Let's read some comments from chat.
749615	755280	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com By the way, I know we have a lot of people on Justin TV tonight because of Loki being Sackboy.
755300	757342	I don't know what it is, if Justin TV highlighted us or something.
757762	767411	But please keep in mind we only read our regular chat room at Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com That's not because we hate you guys at Justin TV, but it's because, well, it's partially that.
768091	771194	We have a real hard time reading two chat rooms at once because we are trying to do a show here.
771254	777758	So chat.orange.com Redertainment in chat says the last time I skipped the gym to game was five years ago.
778118	779599	I haven't been back to the gym since.
781080	781521	There you go.
783522	784182	Alright, anyhow.
784643	787365	I'm assuming that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, so I'll talk about my Gaming Week.
788485	790687	I finally bought a PlayStation 3.
790747	793289	Why are you booing? !
794929	813580	because Wizards and Thugs at least there's good games out now at least you didn't buy it just because oh I want to play there's two good games out now no now now there were finally games I wanted out I want LittleBigPlanet even though I wasn't able to get it yesterday contrary to popular rumor but I have it all set up I have a blu-ray disc at least I have Edward Scissorhands on blu-ray because that movie is awesome
813902	815123	You have to get an M before Christmas, too.
815163	816044	It looks good on the ring.
816264	820687	And I'd like to mention, though, that last week I was concerned that I may have to return my copy a little bit.
820707	821828	You motherfucker, it's my turn.
821848	822729	I'm just kidding.
822749	824170	So I didn't have to, thank God.
824210	826051	So I get to keep the slightly offensive version.
826212	826532	Awesome.
827782	829784	Alright, so yeah, I finally took the plunge and got a PlayStation 3.
830764	833346	For SingStar ABBA as well, even though that's not out until December.
833446	836008	But I did buy SingStar PlayStation 3.
836969	841673	And, you know, the game itself is kind of crappy compared to, like, Rock Band and other songs you can sing in.
842013	844375	But I will tell you the best thing about SingStar PlayStation 3.
845015	846276	Actually, there's a couple good things about it.
846676	850059	It's a really good party game because it has the music videos in the back.
850239	852801	It's a good game for non-gamers, if that makes sense.
852821	855463	Like, it's a good game for people to just pick up the mics and sing and have fun with it.
855783	871410	and there are a lot of songs on the sing store even though I haven't heard of half of them there's like 300 songs on that store but I'll tell you the best part is that part that's like YouTube that you can go in there and look at the community videos I don't have a webcam myself thank you very much I don't want to put myself on there I do no don't worry about it but
872250	872830	I guess this is growing up
894676	895657	She's so cute.
895797	899680	And so that's the best part of the game is just going on like the YouTube type thing and looking at that.
900061	900822	So I had fun with it.
901582	903284	So yeah, I don't know.
903444	904184	It's not for everyone.
904245	905506	Get it if you have a lot of parties.
905626	909489	But if you're a solo gamer, I don't think there's a lot here for you unless you like to sing to yourself.
910470	911951	Otherwise, I'm just holding out for LittleBigPlanet.
912432	915014	And I'll probably be going back to the 360 in the meantime.
915054	915935	However, I will say this.
916576	920459	PlayStation 3 has... I gotta say, that Blu-ray player is pretty awesome.
921360	924143	And it does upscale the old movies pretty good on DVD.
924343	927606	And the media server, I thought, was a lot easier to use than Microsoft's.
927746	929267	Yeah, the media server's pretty awesome.
929287	930148	I was really surprised.
930188	931129	That kind of surprised me.
931490	936254	I was thinking that the 360 media server would be a lot easier because, you know, hello, Windows, Microsoft.
936554	939237	No, the PlayStation 3 one was disgustingly simple.
939617	940018	However...
940798	951436	here's a word of advice for you folks don't run the media server and your internet connection at the same time because your internet connection can't hold it on the Playstation 3 that's the one thing about it so
952554	952854	There you go.
952874	953975	That was pretty much my gaming week.
954015	955116	Otherwise, I haven't played a whole lot.
955516	958958	Aurora Faint on the iPhone, which is pretty awesome for a free game.
959318	960759	That game is all kinds of awesome.
961139	961960	I had another game.
962060	962380	What's that?
962880	964381	I downloaded Pole Position Remix.
964861	965321	How'd you like that?
966262	969224	It's actually surprisingly easy to play, but I still suck at Pole Position.
970444	972025	But the crashes and everything are fantastic.
972105	974127	I suck at Pole Position.
975938	981841	BlackWolf in chatroom says, confirmed, Rob likes parents exploiting children on the internet.
981921	982181	Yeah.
985363	985783	It's cute.
988948	990570	If you don't do this, you don't get to eat.
992892	993753	And Ross D.O.U.T.
993793	996696	says, Rob, I have media server and internet running at the same time, no problem.
996716	997277	Well, that's you.
997697	998278	Congrats to you.
998758	1000420	Alright, it didn't work right for me.
1000440	1001181	Rob's special.
1001521	1002162	I know, my special.
1002382	1004644	But now I have all the next gen systems.
1005045	1005645	So there you have it.
1006713	1013020	I did get, you know, if you got Pole Position on the phone, I will say I got Pac-Man on the iPhone, which is kind of neat because you can do motion.
1013080	1013561	You can tilt it.
1013581	1014121	I didn't like it.
1014362	1015443	Yeah, it's kind of dumb.
1015663	1018326	Like, you play it once and then it's over, so just get the free trial.
1018366	1018867	Don't pay for it.
1019508	1022511	But the pull position one, though, honestly, it really is playable.
1022572	1031261	And on top of that, not only can you have it use your tilt to turn left or right, you can choose to have your accelerator or your brake on screen.
1032943	1036347	Or you can actually have a steering wheel on screen to steer with.
1036948	1038069	Or you can use a slider.
1038970	1039851	So that's kind of cool.
1041062	1051913	I'm looking in chat, and I lied, I looked at JustinTV chat for a minute, and a person by the name of SonyPS3Sucks, who I'm sure is just thrilled to hear my news this week, says that Jelly Car is on iPhone for free.
1052274	1059841	I forgot about that, I read about that somewhere, and that was actually a really awesome game on the XNA service, the little beta thing they had there, so I really want to check that out on iPhone.
1060082	1061023	So, there you go.
1063425	1064807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1078935	1093455	it's actually pretty neat it's got an interface that you can trace the writing so you can really learn your brush strokes and stuff it's got a bunch of fun little games to play that actually really have been helping my memory and helping me remember the shit that I learned a few years ago when I actually did take Japanese class
1094423	1100588	Would you say that it's something that somebody could pick up and learn Japanese with, or is it better as a supplement to an actual Japanese class?
1100608	1114140	I think it's better as a supplement to an actual Japanese class, but it is nice because it does have a dictionary and a phrase guide thing built into it, so if you are somewhere and you need to say something that you don't exactly know how to say, you can look up real quick and be like, this is what I need to say, this is how I have to say it.
1114521	1114821	Awesome.
1115782	1117183	Drew, what's one thing you've been playing this week?
1118422	1121224	World of Warcraft, The Burning Cr- Brains.
1121244	1122785	Brains.
1122845	1125167	We have a story coming on that later, but how's Wobbengal?
1125187	1126108	Are you excited about Lich King?
1126693	1127453	Oh, very excited.
1127493	1130275	I've been leveling with Chimera lately.
1131255	1133256	Thanks to that Recruit a Friend thing, triple experience.
1133276	1135317	She and I are going through Outlands as Mage and Warlock.
1135637	1136437	6G3 so far.
1136997	1137578	It's a blast.
1137598	1139238	What are you most looking forward to about Lich King?
1140439	1141019	Death Knights.
1141499	1142660	That and motorcycles.
1143000	1143320	Awesome.
1144381	1147582	The Doctor, who by the way brought us some mushrooms for the studio.
1147602	1148863	I don't know if you can see them on Justin.TV.
1148883	1150403	Can you hold one up for the Justin.TV folks?
1150943	1152004	What the mushrooms look like here?
1153271	1153691	There you go.
1154252	1154692	Look at that.
1155192	1156653	And those are awesome.
1156693	1158954	Did you make those just for this, or did you steal those from your work?
1159374	1161696	Last year at my work, we did Mario as the theme for Halloween.
1162396	1163617	So one of my coworkers made them.
1164017	1164277	Awesome.
1164297	1165778	Well, thank you for stealing them and bringing them here.
1166839	1168340	What's one game you've been playing this week, Doctor?
1169100	1173282	Actually, Hiccup Boy's gotten me back into DDR, which, oh my god, that's like the best exercise ever.
1173302	1174423	You've lost some weight, too.
1174543	1175344	Well, maybe.
1175404	1176044	Yeah, just today.
1177145	1179906	Oh my god, because my hand's all sweaty from DDR.
1180206	1181027	What kind of DDR?
1181927	1182708	It's old school DDR.
1182768	1183068	It's like
1183672	1184373	Arcadian, Sonic Chronicles DS
1207992	1210613	DS, and that's like what, it's all the old school Sonic games?
1210813	1212373	No, it's a new RPG.
1212433	1215594	Oh, I thought it was actually called Sonic RPG.
1215694	1216975	Okay, how is it?
1217055	1217255	Good?
1217475	1218455	It's pretty good so far.
1218475	1220316	I've played like three or four hours.
1220336	1222896	Halfway through the second mission.
1223176	1224797	Is there any other RPGs you can kind of compare to?
1225740	1226960	I don't know.
1228041	1234742	It's a little bit different because you're kind of moving around with the stylus.
1234862	1244865	Actually, because there's an interesting system where if you've got to chase the enemies or run away from them, so you basically have the characters running away or running towards the...
1246832	1248494	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
1262923	1265924	from hitting the boxes so that they can catch up.
1266204	1266864	Cool.
1267084	1272645	It sounds like this game might be redeeming the Sonic franchise a little bit after a relatively last few weak years.
1273025	1275126	Actually, I haven't played any of the games in a long time.
1276446	1277246	It's for the best, Bradley.
1277366	1280347	If you want to stay a Sega fanboy, you probably should stay away from them.
1281147	1284188	Let's also ask KickUpBoy, what's one game you've been playing this week?
1284762	1290045	Well, I kind of haven't gotten over COD 4 at all yet.
1290545	1291425	Alright, a shooter fan.
1291565	1292526	Isn't that game good?
1292846	1293346	It's amazing.
1293546	1294066	It's really great.
1294086	1301950	Except you get those people that are just like, oh, on one-on-one I can kick your ass, and then we go on one-on-one and they leave shortly after that.
1303471	1305792	What would you say is the singular best thing about that game?
1306292	1312635	The best thing has got to be just... There's not just one.
1314657	1315959	Are you looking forward to COD5?
1317060	1318001	Yeah, yes and no.
1318642	1322967	They kind of went back in time, so I'm kind of like, oh, I feel like back to the future kind of thing.
1323368	1326251	What's something they need to do in COD5 they didn't do before?
1328123	1332265	They need to make sure no juggernaut is allowed because that's just kind of wimpy.
1345189	1372977	Our username on LiveJournal is Orange Lounge Or on MySpace, we're Orange Lounge Radio On Facebook, we're the OL Army And now on Twitter, we're OLR Yes, that's four different sites and four different names Go figure, it just never works out Also, I want to say this Since we've been doing this diligently for 300 episodes We are taking next week off There will be no show next week So there you have it Because we earned it We will be providing live footage of a colonoscopy
1373433	1373833	No, I'm not.
1374213	1374953	Here's the deal.
1375374	1382756	I'm not having a colonoscopy, but you guys might remember if you've been listening to the show this year, I had some medical issues back in April that kept me out of the show for a week.
1383216	1387417	I'm having surgery Wednesday, and that's why there's not going to be a show on Sunday because I'm still going to be recovering.
1388098	1389438	I'm having a gallbladder removal.
1389458	1390878	I'm sure I mentioned this a couple weeks ago.
1390978	1391999	It's not a big deal.
1392139	1393099	Other people have had it done.
1393139	1398381	It's laparoscopic, so it's not going to be a big deal, but I am planning to pretty much be out of everything for a week.
1399321	1399881	There you have it.
1400302	1401623	So now you'll understand.
1401663	1403164	So no kicking and screaming.
1403184	1403804	There's no show.
1404164	1410749	Take a chance to play some more games or listen to one of our other wonderful shows that we co-broadcast with on All Games Radio.
1412750	1416293	So let's move into some gaming news then tonight, I think, if we're ready.
1417145	1417325	Yes.
1417645	1417925	Alright.
1418286	1418566	Alright.
1419266	1425790	Well, you may remember the new PSP 3000 was announced and has finally made it to the market.
1427671	1430732	Although it's not really being received that well.
1431393	1438516	Problem is, apparently the new advanced LCD screen that's on it is causing some issues with scan lines.
1439037	1442739	Noticeable scan lines and it looks very bad.
1444419	1450922	It is now a little bit brighter, and the colors are a little bit better, but the scan lines look like crap.
1451403	1461387	And Sony is apparently looking into the problem right now, but no sort of fix is being done.
1462187	1469831	And since this is a phenomenon that is caused by hardware characteristics, there is no plan to fix it with the system software update.
1471727	1485671	So, you might want to hold on to those PSP-2000s and forego the built-in microphone and, I don't know, better, questionably better LCD screen.
1485751	1487671	Or maybe just wait a little while for it to get fixed.
1487731	1489812	Is it possible that they're going to, like, kind of fix these?
1492652	1494893	They're going to have to replace them if that's the case.
1496676	1497276	Interesting.
1498997	1506542	Well, what's kind of interesting also is that it seems like there might be some type of very quiet under-the-radar recall going on right now.
1508243	1514667	I guess it's because people are complaining about this, and apparently the description actually got this slight word change going on.
1515908	1521231	Instead of saying the system features an improved LCD screen, it says the system features an advanced LCD screen.
1521571	1525654	So you can kind of see that they might be kind of admitting that there's something going on.
1525714	1535079	It kind of reminds me of, was it, if anyone's watched Invader Zim, when he's introduced to his sidekick, Gur, he's like, he kind of looks broken.
1535179	1537661	They're all, he's not broken, he's advanced.
1540322	1545983	Well, here's the other interesting thing is that Amazon.com just suddenly canceled a bunch of pre-orders for the PSP 3000.
1547244	1551505	Some folks had the limited edition 4GB memory entertainment pack for this thing reserved.
1551825	1558266	Amazon sent everybody emails that said that the item was not available from the sources, so that they canceled all the orders.
1558887	1561327	Yeah, in fact, we got something similar to that.
1561987	1563568	They were expected in...
1564588	1564969	and DarkSakura.
1582250	1584811	Play it in stores and see if it's something that bugs you that bad.
1584851	1587772	Because I bet to a lot of gamers, they're not going to give a shit.
1588153	1590894	To be honest, it looks pretty bad.
1591034	1593315	But there's a lot of PSP 2000 systems out there.
1593395	1602318	And really, all you're supposedly improving is the LCD screen, which obviously is not improved this time, and a built-in microphone.
1602358	1606720	So if microphones aren't really a big deal for you, I mean, you can go buy one for like $20.
1607921	1608261	I don't know.
1608901	1610522	So I would just maybe hold off.
1612456	1613897	Why do you need to buy another system?
1613957	1616899	I mean, after all, the last system update came about a year ago.
1618220	1618841	Alright, well.
1621443	1622163	What was that, Meltan?
1622543	1623104	She didn't have a mic.
1623965	1626707	I said not to mention there's hardly any new PSP games coming out.
1626727	1628548	They're like, here's a bunch of new systems to throw at you.
1628568	1631030	We've got like 20 games coming out in the next six months.
1631070	1631410	Have fun.
1633972	1634332	Alright.
1634992	1638775	Well, we'll see what continues to develop over there and hopefully some PSP games.
1638855	1639616	A lot of good stuff in 2009.
1639696	1639896	We'll see.
1641610	1645671	That could possibly be, but honestly, you know my opinion on the PSP.
1647552	1649413	Actually, it's the same opinion I have on any system.
1649893	1650613	It stinks.
1651013	1652974	Only as good as the games that are on it.
1653074	1655115	It does have Popolocross, which is a cute game.
1655895	1656195	Okay.
1657076	1661737	Well, this comes as an absolute surprise to no one.
1662398	1663458	Because, what?
1665199	1668240	Do you just like gasping into the microphone as if you're in a porn?
1668380	1668880	I'm no one.
1670695	1672278	Do that a little bit more throaty.
1672718	1672959	No.
1673480	1673740	No.
1674221	1674681	No, I don't.
1674962	1675182	No.
1675603	1675803	No.
1676444	1676705	Okay.
1677005	1677205	Sorry.
1677626	1677886	Anyway.
1678748	1679229	Thank you, Rob.
1680170	1682454	Now, you have to mimic the master here.
1685005	1697735	Anyway, well, the game was trademarked in July, but there is going to be Star Wars The Old Republic, which is the MMO that's based off of KOTOR, Knights of the Old Republic.
1697856	1704241	Also the term coined by our friend Krista Skrotor when she worked for Lucas back in the day.
1704938	1717628	Anyway, with this, it's supposed to be 300 years after Knights of the Old Republic 2, which is 3,500 years before the film, and you can choose between either the Republic or the Sith Empire.
1718069	1727957	You can either be light side or dark side, but you can be one of those alignments within whatever your faction is.
1728717	1733621	So I guess you could be chaotic neutral or lawful evil or, oh wait, wrong game.
1733821	1734042	Anyway.
1735543	1737605	There's two classes that have been revealed already.
1737665	1745935	That's the Sith, the Jedi, and they use lightsabers, and the Force, and we have no idea when it's coming out or what it's coming out on.
1746075	1750220	But, but, but, can I kill Jar Jar Binks?
1750768	1753229	Jar Jar has not been born yet or conceived.
1753249	1758572	She could probably find... Can I find Jar Jar's super great grandma and kill her?
1758933	1762034	And cut off the fishy cock.
1762415	1765596	The fishy cock?
1766897	1769759	Did you just tell me to go slice off the fishy cock?
1770219	1771199	Fish do not have cocks.
1771400	1773521	They deposit their eggs into the ocean.
1773601	1777323	But they're supposed to be humanoid creatures, so I assume that there's some cock involved.
1779105	1781907	There's always talking about... They're aquatic.
1782408	1791955	Okay, needless to say, the internet and the gamers on the internet all had a... Needless to say, the collective internet gamers had a giant orgasm when this game was announced.
1792795	1794497	All their fish cocks went off at once.
1796158	1800221	In a fountain of... There's a lot of people definitely looking forward to a KOTOR MMO.
1800281	1803463	In a fountain of... Tamago.
1803563	1805805	I've heard there are people that are going to leave WoW for this.
1806125	1808207	Just like you and I are going to go play Star Trek.
1808510	1810051	but I'm not leaving well because guess what?
1810111	1810351	I am.
1810791	1811752	I already left.
1811972	1812252	I know.
1813192	1813953	Fuck your KOTOR.
1813973	1815314	We've got Star Trek MMO coming out.
1815334	1817775	We're going to have some Star Trek.
1817795	1819196	There's a Star Trek MMO coming out?
1819216	1820216	Where the fuck have you been?
1820356	1821677	Can I cream my shorts right now?
1821717	1823478	Because I love Star Trek so much.
1823498	1824498	Can you stand up so they can see?
1824618	1825399	Star Trek Online.
1826539	1827480	This is called Star Trek Online.
1828160	1829041	But what time period?
1829881	1831522	After current.
1832282	1833103	I think it's set like 35.
1836080	1836941	35 or 40 years after Nemesis.
1836961	1841025	So you get your own joystick for your ship.
1841345	1841946	No!
1841966	1845228	And Janeway's dead and Picard's dead.
1845849	1846950	Well, Janeway could still be alive.
1847230	1852615	Sounds awesome.
1852695	1855798	You can do customizing on your ship.
1856699	1858900	So you can calibrate the Dilithium Crystal.
1858920	1861543	And I want there to be an achievement called Redstrip Massacre.
1863586	1873152	Oh wait, if it's set in that series, okay, if it was red shirts first and then yellow in Next Generation, then what color are they going to go to for the next series to come out?
1874093	1874513	Magenta.
1874933	1875894	Magenta shirts, no.
1877694	1880655	Alright, I'm going to get some comments from chat.
1880975	1889337	RossDLUT says, what I'm concerned about with Old Republic is that A, this virtually guarantees no KOTOR 3, and B, Bioware's never done an MMO before.
1889357	1891518	I can't shake the idea that they might try to ape WoW.
1892058	1892838	Well, WoW's a good game.
1893918	1903061	Let's see, we also have GS68 says, I was going to get a PSP 3000 for Christmas, but I think I'll just save for a desktop arcade poppin' con.
1903601	1903921	We'll see.
1904521	1907582	SJ100 Matt says I'm waiting for the OLR Starfleet.
1910023	1910323	Alright.
1911344	1912684	Let's move on with some more news.
1913324	1914145	Back to PlayStation 3.
1914765	1918306	Well, PlayStation Home isn't even out yet and it's already been hacked.
1919298	1920420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1935539	1948864	Apparently he has decrypted over 9,000 files belonging to it, and this is supposedly going to lead to better understanding how PlayStation 3 games and the PlayStation Network works and its structure.
1949444	1961169	So apparently it's all back-end stuff, and they're going to hopefully allow it to lead to other exploits and possibly custom stuff for the cross-media bar and all that fun stuff.
1961669	1963370	I don't know, right now it's a whole bunch of nothing.
1964210	1966431	But it's progress, and progress is always good, I guess.
1966871	1968031	You know what I think is hilarious?
1968712	1970132	That these people do this as a hobby.
1971853	1977195	You know what, I bet the best way to end all the hacking and everything is to offer these guys jobs.
1978615	1979495	Oh no, they wouldn't do that.
1979535	1981236	It would actually be original content.
1981636	1982616	We don't want that.
1984177	1984497	Pay them.
1984857	1987078	We want rehashes of everything.
1988922	1991243	Yeah, but how long before Sony tries to close this gap?
1991263	1993504	I mean, the home's not even out yet, really.
1993664	1994764	Yeah, not very long.
1996225	1998746	But, you know, hey, I don't know.
1998866	2000407	It's neat, I guess.
2000527	2002688	It's fun to say, hey, look, I hacked home.
2002788	2004468	Hey, I'm SkaterFU.
2004548	2005989	I hacked home.
2006260	2019226	But what's kind of neat though, speaking of the home beta, if you do want to get into the home beta, just keep an eye out for the next issue of Core, which is going to do some features behind the scenes regarding home.
2019726	2026989	And they're also going to have home beta entries, so you will be able to test home before home launches, whenever home actually launches.
2027429	2028490	Although it's probably going to launch soon.
2029150	2044798	Well, do you remember on last week's show, there was a big to-do about the whole censorship in the game LittleBigPlanet, and how one of the songs controversially quoted the Koran in its lyrics, and Sony was going to patch, they were really nervous about this, they were going to patch the game, take the lyrics out.
2044898	2045479	It was retarded.
2045619	2046479	Well, here's the thing.
2048700	2050881	It's kind of an interesting follow-up to this whole thing.
2050901	2054061	We were kind of waiting for comment from the other side.
2054121	2056502	Like, hmm, what's the community going to think?
2056542	2060282	What's the rest of the Muslim community going to think if this word gets out there that this is in the game?
2060643	2062223	Well, you might be surprised at what happened.
2063063	2069204	M. Zudi Jassir, MD, and he is the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy.
2069764	2072565	He talked to a website called Edge Gaming or the Edge Podcast.
2072825	2076026	Game Network, and he said something kind of interesting here.
2076546	2083607	He said that censorship and Sony being willing to bend at the request for censorship is counterproductive to the freedom of speech.
2083967	2084867	Let me give you this quote.
2085327	2098090	"...to demand that the game be withdrawn is predicated on a society which gives theocrats who wish to control speech far more value than the central principle of freedom of expression upon which the very practice and freedom of religion is based."
2098570	2107516	The fact that the music writer is a devout Muslim should highlight that at the core of this issue is not about offending all Muslims but only about freedom of expression and the free market.
2108817	2123367	He says he himself does not endorse the use of the Quran verses in non-educational video games but he says in this case basically that the First Amendment takes precedence and that the Islamic Foundation stands against all forms of censorship.
2125148	2128090	I think that's beautiful and isn't that sort of what we said last week?
2128482	2129503	In a way, in a way.
2129603	2136311	So it is kind of interesting to see that now Sony has almost a little bit of egg on it.
2136331	2137872	They just can't win with this.
2138133	2142858	Rice Princess was called and she said censorship equals... Thank you.
2143118	2143819	Is she coming tonight?
2145501	2147943	Actually, she's six, so she's going to try to make it.
2148023	2149144	Isn't she Fire Princess now?
2149164	2150085	Yeah, she is Fire Princess.
2150205	2150986	No, she's six.
2151006	2152427	She's going to try to make it, though.
2152447	2154449	But, you know, everybody say, Fire Princess.
2155049	2155310	Alright.
2156671	2157011	Alright.
2158312	2161755	Let's move on and talk about some... Oh, by the way, just a real quick note on LittleBigPlanet.
2161775	2163517	The 1.02 patch is out now.
2164071	2166552	and it basically just strips the lyrics out of the song.
2166592	2169173	Yeah, it doesn't take the song out, it just removes the lyrics.
2169814	2170414	Which is fine.
2171294	2173715	Because I didn't understand what they meant anyway, so we're right there.
2174476	2179218	Didn't they have a big to-do about this way back in the day with that game War Gods?
2179278	2184200	Didn't one of the tracks in that game quote the Koran or something and they took that out?
2184340	2184840	Oh, who knows.
2185840	2188321	This has been an issue for a while with other games.
2188341	2189242	You'd think people would learn.
2191090	2193412	It just seems like bullshit to me the whole time.
2193592	2194052	It really is.
2194132	2194512	Oh, sorry.
2194592	2196093	I should be watching my language.
2196733	2197634	Oh, fuck that.
2197834	2198874	Okay.
2199595	2200615	It's like I said last week.
2200675	2204137	If they wanted to be offended at somebody, they should have been offended at the artist that made the song.
2205398	2209960	Which I think is completely retarded anyway since he himself, as stated, was a devout Muslim.
2210000	2211701	So, whatever.
2211721	2214383	Yeah, but isn't that... So he was a Muslim, the guy that wrote the song?
2214403	2214463	Yes.
2214483	2217604	Because there's like, you know, there's Ninju, and that's made by a Jewish guy.
2217624	2217804	Like...
2220151	2220831	Have you seen Ninja?
2220871	2221031	No.
2221091	2221591	No, I haven't.
2221611	2225872	All right, before we unravel more conversation on the program tonight, let's get to some release dates.

2621685	2627650	Gran Turismo 5 Prologue hasn't come out in... This is Spec 3, so it's probably like... What the hell's the difference?
2627670	2630452	It's probably different cars to get people to buy it again.
2630732	2631072	Sorry.
2632233	2633054	Hey, now, wait a minute.
2633434	2634895	Sorry if you didn't get to see that turn, but that's gay.
2635095	2635516	Seriously.

2652496	2654317	Look at those pants.
2654337	2655298	Please don't say that.
2656079	2656339	What?
2656920	2660503	Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something is dumb or stupid.
2660844	2661564	It's insulting.
2663706	2670993	It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said, man, this pepper shaker is so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache.
2672234	2672795	Just saying.
2673777	2676458	When you say that's so gay, do you realize what you say?
2676759	2677399	Knock it off.
2699570	2702472	On the Nintendo Wii, never mind, I'm not going to get political right now.
2702992	2710617	Nintendo Wii, My Sims Kingdom comes out this week, as does Bokujou Monogatari, Waku Waku Animal March.

2759583	2760904	It is Chocoball Boxing.
2760924	2763005	Let's get back to boxing with Chocoball.
2763045	2765606	Chocobox is not a game.
2765686	2767487	It's a case for your DS.
2769108	2771470	What are they making Chocoball Boxing?
2771710	2772750	That would be pretty awesome.

2782017	2785599	Lastly, on the Sony PSP, is there anything coming out this week?
2786180	2788041	Well, you actually would be surprised.
2788061	2789242	Yes, there's quite a bit coming out this week.
2789562	2797067	Cardinal Arc Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G gets a price reduction and the best, as does Rockman Rockman.
2798689	2801410	That would just be, you know, you know how they remade Mega Man 1 for PSP?
2801470	2801911	It's just that.
2802871	2803452	It's that whole thing.
2804437	2805977	Alright, that's it for Japanese release dates.
2806017	2807738	Let's go back to some more gaming news.
2807998	2808638	Do we gotta?
2808898	2809438	Yes, we gotta.
2810358	2812539	Well, this is about death.
2813239	2813599	Cool.
2814639	2816819	Ultimate, final character death.
2818560	2826301	A 43-year-old Japanese woman was arrested for killing her virtual husband on MapleStory.
2827561	2829922	I know, where's our stupid person music, Rob?
2831590	2833630	Wait, did she kill him in game?
2834450	2834991	She killed him in game.
2835671	2836011	Oh, okay.
2836311	2837851	But she got arrested for killing him in game?
2838771	2839731	Or did she kill him for real real?
2839751	2840351	Here's what happened.
2840552	2842452	No, she killed him in... This is what happened.
2843112	2844672	She's a piano teacher.
2844692	2855054	43-year-old piano teacher was furious because she had been divorced in game.
2856314	2860615	So she accessed his login and deleted his character.
2862168	2864450	So she killed him in-game.
2864931	2873578	She's in jail in Sapporo, and she's facing charges of illegally accessing a computer and manipulating data.
2874800	2879003	Her in-game husband was a 33-year-old office worker, and...
2882276	2883677	I really don't know what he thinks of it.
2883717	2884778	There's no comment about that.
2884818	2892664	But this happened last May, and the woman could pay fines and potentially a five-year jail sentence if she's convicted.
2895370	2895751	Thanks for watching!
2912754	2916218	I hope I can't be held accountable for all the people I kill.
2916638	2919381	DJ Dark Knight says it's a huge crime in Japan.
2920202	2921123	Look, this is the thing.
2921984	2929331	I understand it, and honestly, I would want some sort of retaliation.
2929411	2931273	She did break the law.
2932296	2937078	She illegally accessed his information and she broke the law.
2937538	2943080	However, I just think it's so fucking retarded that this is Mabel's story!
2944441	2945081	It's free!
2946481	2950163	Okay, I would be pissed off if someone did that to my Ragnarok account.
2951123	2953444	I would be pissed off if that happened on my Ragnarok account.
2954464	2954824	You know.
2956085	2956305	But...
2957648	2958429	It's not the end of the world.
2958449	2959569	Five years in jail?
2959769	2962071	I mean, God, pissing you off is bad enough.
2962371	2963232	Can you imagine the phone call?
2963252	2964873	What do you mean pissing me off is bad enough?
2965213	2967595	What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Rob?
2967655	2968195	Exactly.
2968235	2969616	Exactly as it was intended.
2969776	2971537	Can you imagine the phone call?
2971817	2974559	I'd like to report a murder of my character.
2974719	2979282	Okay, see, I was thinking of the World of Warcraft South Park episode.
2981584	2984746	It's like, and he's killing people's characters.
2985413	2985834	Mom!
2986454	2986895	Bathroom!
2987735	2988116	Bathroom!
2990518	2993021	I am such an achievement whore now.
2993141	2994883	Anyhow, hey, let's move on with the news.
2997706	3000849	Sorry, I've been distracted because the doctor has boobs now.
3001630	3002851	And boobs are distracting.
3003912	3004292	Anyways.
3005814	3007115	So that's what kind of doctor you are.
3007736	3008477	That's the doctor.
3009158	3010759	Hello, Doctor.
3010799	3024968	Apparently, Guitar Hero World Tour is facing some drum issues, as some other hosts so viciously described.
3026129	3027510	There are some issues with the drums.
3027810	3029771	I'm not sensing the hits.
3032413	3033754	Sorry, that's to come later.
3034014	3034414	Ignore that.
3036374	3037755	I let the audio run too long again.
3037895	3038235	My bad.
3038675	3039035	Shame, shame.
3039055	3040936	The fucking drums aren't fucking working right.
3041396	3043197	Anyway, so the drums aren't working correctly.
3043237	3049419	Basically, they're either not sensing hits or they're just plain not doing anything.
3049619	3051159	They're faulty like this show.
3051539	3052560	They're very faulty.
3053460	3058422	I mean, personally, I kind of called that they were faulty, but for whole different reasons.
3058482	3065264	I mean, the thing looks like it's made out of PVC and was seriously like rocking when people were playing it and not rocking in the good way.
3067266	3067607	I don't know.
3069628	3078916	I think as Bobby Blackwolf put it on his show, if they're going to brag that their instruments are better than rock band's instruments, then maybe they should work.
3080117	3081878	Let's start with the working first.
3084701	3087103	That's the only sound my guitar hero drums will make.
3087303	3089645	I have pumpkin-y goodness in me, by the way, Rob.
3089805	3090105	Thank you.
3090305	3090746	You're welcome.
3090986	3092887	We're eating pumpkin bagels here in studio, just so you know.
3093208	3093628	We are?
3094469	3094669	I am.
3095595	3096075	Yeah, that's fine.
3096155	3097856	Actually, eat that Halloween candy.
3097896	3099696	I can't have the candy, and John doesn't want it.
3100376	3101596	So bring the thing out here.
3101657	3102297	Make everybody eat it.
3102877	3103817	Give some to Justin TV.
3103857	3104197	I don't care.
3104817	3105077	All right.
3105137	3107258	Hey, big news this week.
3107298	3107738	Oh, my God.
3107818	3113599	Huge news about something we here at Orange Lounge Radio used to cover every year and then kind of stopped.
3114980	3115940	E3 is coming back.
3117000	3117400	That's right.
3117840	3123122	E3 2009 is coming back the way we know it, not this whole, like, scaled-down show we had.
3123142	3123962	I didn't know that.
3124980	3126442	Thanks for watching!
3134198	3137079	Basically, E3 is going to be just like it was before.
3137399	3140340	However, that doesn't mean that anybody is going to be able to get in.
3140380	3141160	It's not public.
3141620	3144341	It's just, you know, it's going to be back to the same audience.
3144361	3144761	Oh, come on.
3144801	3147742	When it was originally going on anyways, it was almost public.
3147782	3156224	It's like, I work at Walmart or I know someone that works at Walmart in the garden department because they, you know, it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or something like that.
3156304	3156624	It's like...
3157424	3162047	I work in a store that looks at video games, and therefore, you know, I should be able to go.
3162107	3164869	I have a crappy podcast on the internet that's been going for six years.
3164929	3165389	I get to go.
3165849	3166049	What?
3166509	3169992	This means that we need to get our business stuff set back up.
3170132	3171112	Yeah, we gotta go.
3171472	3171953	We're going.
3172473	3172893	It'll be fun.
3172913	3174454	Yeah, that's gonna be tough.
3174654	3178116	I'm gonna try to get the wife to let me go, but, uh... Ooh, ouch.
3178457	3179317	Tell her Fable 3 will be there.
3179337	3180578	This is how it works at my house.
3181058	3181959	Hey, Dan, I'm going to E3.
3184175	3185316	Yeah, but you can do that.
3186257	3187017	He can come with me.
3188038	3188778	That's his thing.
3188838	3190099	He's come with me every year.
3190499	3191340	Drag the intern.
3191760	3205769	The website Joystick, that's Joystick with a Q, actually interviewed the president of the ESA, Doug Lowenstein, and he actually said, they asked him, if you had to give E3 a six-letter word or less tagline, what would it be?
3206309	3210792	And I'm sorry, Doug Lowenstein was the former president of the ESA.
3210852	3211913	Now it's Mike Gallagher.
3212884	3213264	DarkSakura.com
3239053	3243434	When it was an industry-only thing, it still was going down the tubes.
3243994	3250276	And you had better things like, I don't know, Leipzig and PAX as the true gamers' conventions.
3251336	3254737	I mean, even for the industry, it's just not that good anymore.
3254977	3256998	I'm kind of curious what effect this is going to have on PAX.
3257618	3261559	If that's going to cause less people to want to go to PAX now because they'll want to use their vacation on E3.
3261819	3264400	Because not everybody can take vacation all the time, you know what I mean?
3264780	3267621	Honestly, if I had to choose between the two, though, to be perfectly honest...
3268681	3269662	I want to go to PAX again.
3269902	3270942	I really want to go to PAX again.
3271002	3272403	You know, PAX was a lot of fun.
3272443	3275284	PAX was more of like the gamer show, but I'm a greedy bastard.
3275304	3276005	I'm going to go to both.
3276065	3276385	Hello.
3276405	3277885	Well, no, I'd love to go to both.
3277905	3282688	I'd especially like to see what this E3 revival is, you know?
3283188	3286750	But if I had to pick between one or the other, I would pick PAX.
3287470	3288190	All right, there you go.
3289491	3292372	So Orange Lounge Radio, live from E3 this June.
3292693	3295534	However, if we do go to E3, we're totally freaking going to Disneyland.
3296650	3297270	We'll see what we can do.
3297570	3297931	We are.
3298871	3299351	Yes, ma'am.
3300912	3302593	But it's during the summer.
3302753	3303413	So what?
3303873	3304313	Teacups.
3305274	3308075	Teacups for the win and California Screamin'.
3308675	3310896	Let's move on with the news or we'll never get to Disneyland.
3311197	3314598	You know what Disneyland could use more of?
3315078	3315679	Zombies.
3316499	3318160	You know what Call of Duty is getting more of?
3318180	3320021	Tell about my story.
3320681	3321241	Well, I'm sorry.
3321301	3323322	You were just talking about Disneyland and I stopped listening.
3325123	3325423	Go ahead.
3326641	3330586	Well, with E3's revival, what happens to E for All?
3331246	3333068	It gets flushed down the toilet!
3333869	3336152	Whee!
3336172	3339396	I don't have a toilet flush noise, sorry.
3339416	3343541	Yep, there's no more E for All, and I'm laughing my ass off.
3343661	3343901	Why?
3343941	3344802	Why all the negativity?
3344822	3346304	There's too much cynicism in here tonight.
3346946	3347546	Thanks for watching!
3359775	3360996	Fuck you, I'm going to PAX.
3384901	3398164	it was pretty cool plus I got to meet Jonathan Colton and Will Wheaton and I couldn't do that at E for All Janai in chat makes the mandatory joke here that I think is pretty clever E for End did you hear that one Jamie?
3400205	3414288	E for End aww that's perfect I was telling Mel about Will Wheaton signing my iPhone and it rubbing off by the end of the day but you saw it I did see it I said now my phone is an extra limited edition and so he put a 1 slash 1 on it that was pretty funny
3416843	3418184	Alright, now we can talk about zombies.
3418824	3420864	Because that's what you're going to see at E3 this year.
3420904	3422925	A bunch of unshowered, unslept zombies.
3423045	3424826	Woohoo!
3424846	3427667	We should hand out care packs.
3427727	3430828	We should hand out con care packs like they did at AX that one year.
3431108	3432549	Where they handed out deodorant and soap.
3433749	3437010	Yeah, but unless you're going to put it on them yourself, it's not going to do any good.
3437030	3438411	What's this?
3438431	3440532	Cans of Axe.
3440672	3442932	Axe smells freaking good.
3443052	3444393	Axe is better than Confunk.
3445543	3448984	Confunk is... Confunk is... No, no, no, no, no, no.
3449504	3451064	You know what smells better than Confunk?
3451544	3452104	Cat piss.
3453224	3454125	I'll take your word for it.
3454225	3454965	How about zombies?
3455745	3456485	Yes, zombies.
3456545	3466267	Apparently the megaton bomb that was dropped by GameTrailersTV was that Call of Duty World of War is going to feature a four-player co-op zombie mode.
3467007	3472248	That totally doesn't rip off of another game that's very similar having a four-player co-op zombie mode in it.
3472850	3473290	Left 4 Dead.
3474431	3478155	So I guess, hey, they want to make sure that people know that their game has zombies too.
3479055	3482258	Wow, that's so World of War.
3482298	3484660	I remember the zombie wars back in World War II.
3485421	3488944	My grandpa used to tell me all about those, how the zombies would attack and everything.
3490986	3492647	Ah, yes, the zombies.
3493007	3496891	Thank goodness that we defeated them and showed them democracy.
3497311	3499453	Democracy, bring it to the rest of the world.
3500566	3503090	and no zombies, because zombies are bad.
3504211	3512684	But thankfully, though, Treyarch is able to come back and tell the lost battles of zombies, the part that was left out of the history books.
3512964	3514467	Conspiracy, I say!
3516371	3516991	Brains or no brains?
3545143	3549107	Actually, I do have to say, there's something that completely bothers me about zombie games.
3549607	3550929	About games with zombies in them.
3551529	3553211	How you don't have a stench meter.
3554452	3562299	In zombie movies, in zombie games, why is it that you can't tell where the fucking zombies are by how much their decayed asses stink?
3563100	3566503	Their decaying bodies are gonna smell like rotten meat.
3566704	3568806	Maybe someday there'll be a smell-o-vision.
3569744	3576427	But, you know, nobody in zombie movies are so surprised that the zombies are there when they should have been able to freaking smell corpse in a stench.
3576447	3579808	I know, you have games like, I don't know, Thief with sound meters.
3579908	3581008	Why can't you have smell meters?
3581028	3587631	Maybe there's a lot of zombies and so because they all smell like rotting flesh, the whole place smells like rotting flesh so you can't tell where it's coming from.
3587651	3591892	It should still be stronger the closer you get to that much contained stench.
3592132	3593613	It's like an anime con.
3593993	3594993	It's just like last night.
3595013	3598935	You can tell when you're getting close to the dealer's room by the stink.
3599335	3600155	No, no, no, no.
3600215	3603316	You can tell when you're getting close to the cosplay competition.
3603836	3605797	It's like a Dave Matthews band concert.
3605817	3608338	You can tell when you're getting close to the smell of marijuana.
3609618	3615300	No, when you're getting close to the cosplay competition is when you stop smelling funk and start smelling other things.
3615580	3620401	I don't know if you heard, Drew, but the Grateful Dead, the one guy's keeping on trucking in heaven.
3620941	3621861	I know.
3621881	3622722	He's gratefully dead.
3625720	3627021	Anyhow... Unless he's a zombie!
3627422	3630505	In which case, you need to know how to defeat zombies by playing this game.
3631226	3634449	Or Left 4 Dead, or Saints Row 2, or any other zombie game.
3634589	3637712	World of Warcraft, which has also started the zombie invasion.
3637752	3638213	That's right.
3638773	3642897	Zombie invasion has been hitting World of Warcraft, and there's been just craziness going on.
3643498	3645560	Earlier in the week, there was infections going on.
3645600	3647602	If you would kill an infected critter, or...
3648803	3653824	or the like, you would get turned into a zombie in 10 minutes, and then you could create other zombies, and it was like a disease that was spread around.
3654145	3658126	Well, as the week's been going on, now it takes 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.
3658146	3658486	15 seconds?
3658666	3659346	That was one minute.
3659406	3660786	No, that happened to me earlier today.
3660826	3662487	It took me 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.
3662507	3666128	The more you get hit by zombies, the faster they shave off times.
3666408	3670569	You've got to visit an Argent healer if they haven't been turned into a zombie.
3670689	3673770	Or you have a priest or a paladin remove the disease.
3674750	3680993	All last night I was going on my priest through Orgrimmar making sure all the auction house dealers were clean.
3696059	3699560	And apparently they don't like the people who are cleaning up after the zombies.
3700040	3700981	They don't like the priests.
3701021	3701941	They don't like the pallies.
3702361	3703422	Oh, you're ruining our fun.
3703482	3706623	Hi, you guys are going to low-level zones and killing everything.
3707043	3715347	You know, does anyone find this slightly offensive that there's people walking around into, I don't know, public buildings and exploding?
3715827	3716147	I mean...
3716627	3717428	There's zombies.
3717648	3718929	Don't blame them, there are zombies.
3719569	3723172	Everything is okay when it's zombies and green blood, because it's not real.
3723192	3724934	There were zombies that ate too many Twinkies.
3724974	3728577	So if some zombies flew a plane into a building, that would be okay too?
3728617	3729457	There's zombies!
3731926	3732666	I'm just checking.
3732887	3733187	Alright.
3734167	3736228	Because this is the World of Warcraft game that you're playing.
3736248	3736408	Yes.
3736448	3737649	I don't see any recalls on that.
3737689	3737889	Yes.
3737949	3738189	Alright.
3739470	3744813	We did have people getting infected and then flying to other cities and then exploding when they got there.
3744833	3746114	They zombified in mid-flight.
3747114	3748555	You can't explode in mid-flight?
3748675	3750975	They can't explode in mid-flight, but they can explode as soon as they land.
3751295	3754116	Tenris Murkblood is a new boss that you can fight in Karazhan.
3754136	3756637	My guild just took him down today, and it was actually a fun fight.
3756917	3764480	But only you're going to be able to see him for 10 days, which basically means if you don't play him tonight or Monday, you have one chance because of the resets in Kara.
3764540	3767361	So he drops an axe that is awesome.
3767401	3768581	He will drop this axe every time.
3768621	3773863	He only drops two things, a little bat pet for everybody in the raid, and an axe.
3774403	3774783	DarkSakura.com
3794818	3796240	X-Link Grand Theft Auto 4 Zombies
3812626	3819535	Talk about non-news, but they decided, hey, we're going to jump in on the zombie fun as well, even though this has been around forever.
3819555	3823761	I want to point out, since we just started tonight's show, a new phase just kicked in.
3823781	3826785	Phase 5.5 just started tonight as we went live.
3826805	3827125	Oh, shit.
3827345	3854126	apparently what's happened now there are quests all of a sudden available in the main cities that send you to the faction leader and at some point you are going to be whispered by some type of either a frozen shade or a plagued brain that's going to be taunting you to join their forces and there's some type of quest going on to hopefully clean the world of the plague interesting so it's all going on right now in the world of Warcraft bathroom bathroom
3856926	3857607	Brains David Hasselhoff
3878494	3884119	And, um, he, uh, he actually thinks that it's completely, he actually said that it was hysterical.
3884299	3885320	He's quoted as saying that.
3885961	3890285	And that, um, he thinks that, uh, it's really great that he gets to be in it.
3890685	3893928	And there's also, um, his version of Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?
3895570	3899253	As, uh, the, uh, title to an in-game track.
3899313	3900013	So I think that's pretty funny.
3900033	3901074	Wow, you know, that's just, uh...
3902741	3904643	Rob's computer farted.
3904703	3908165	Well, hello Rice Princess, glad to see you just arrived.
3925273	3929117	Now, I want to point out there's a new song available in Pain.
3929417	3933501	I can't stop this feeling deep inside of me.
3933561	3938626	Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me.
3944471	3945172	I couldn't resist.
3945192	3947893	You gotta love a guy that actually is famous for doing that shit.
3947913	3950375	I mean, seriously, you know what?
3950475	3955777	I wonder if he's just like, what can I do that's so ridiculous that people would still like me?
3955817	3958879	And he keeps making these songs and he's like, okay, people gotta hate me now.
3959339	3964082	And then they're still buying his albums and he's still rich and putting them on TV shows and stuff.
3965042	3965403	I don't know.
3968164	3971526	He's still convinced that he's instrumental in the Berlin Wall coming down.
3974213	3975514	They love him in Germany.
3975814	3977936	Ranma in chat says, I actually like this song.
3978576	3981639	I only read that so that our, you know, thousands of listeners could hear that.
3982179	3984381	That's Ranma, R-A-N-M-A, likes that song.
3985102	3987964	DSSJ100 Matt says, we got half rolled.
3988765	3989265	Yes, you did.
3990046	3990606	Yes, you did.
3991107	3994810	All right, a little more gaming news than the Classic Game of the Week and then a break.
3995677	4002838	If you bought Rock Band 2, you'll know that on the back of your manual, it says you can get 20 free tracks available at a later date.
4002998	4007959	Well, that later date is now November 4th, and there are 20 different tracks you can get.
4009159	4011740	And to be honest, I don't know any of these artists at all.
4012260	4014360	So, real quickly, I'm going to read them off.
4014560	4016181	The 88, Sons and Daughters.
4016901	4018501	Authority Zero, No Regrets.
4019401	4023282	Between the Buried and Me, Prepare to the Sequel.
4024302	4052291	The Cab with Bounce, The Chevelles, Get It On, The Cocktail Slippers, Give It To Me, Dealership with Database Corrupted, End Ever After with I Wanna Be Your Man, The Ghost Towns, Ashes to Fire, Hollywood Undead, Young, The Cutlass, The Feeling, The Lend Price 3, If I Ain't Got You, Leslie Roy, I'm Gone, I'm Going,
4053334	4064004	Opiate for the masses, Burn You Down, Semi-Precious Weapons, Magnetic Baby, Shamius with Like a Fool, Magnetic Baby?
4064955	4065436	I don't know.
4065996	4076724	TheNuno2, Crazy Tuesday, TickleMePink with The Time Is Wrong, Under Oath with Desperate Times, Desperate Measures, and X Japan with Ivy.
4077525	4078405	I have no idea.
4078866	4080227	I have no idea of any of those songs, but hey.
4080427	4084290	I know that actually we were really excited about getting some X Japan.
4084730	4087351	But hey, at least they're free, and free is awesome.
4087431	4087931	That's right.
4088051	4088511	No bitching.
4088551	4088951	It's free.
4089251	4091412	And there might be some cool songs in there that you've never heard of before.
4091892	4094473	So make sure that you register before the 4th.
4094513	4106657	I mean, you probably can afterwards, but if you want to make sure you get it day one, register at rockband.com slash bonustracks, and they will send you an email with your code to download them once they become available.
4107674	4109155	Kiss Them For Me, and Killing Jar
4126454	4130757	And that's all by Suzy and the Banshees, which is like one of the greatest bands ever.
4131217	4137322	Dammit by Blink-182, that song that Rob was talking about the little girl singing earlier in SingStar.
4138723	4139363	Let's see here.
4139383	4144707	It looks like Metal Onan by the Silver Sun Pickups.
4145968	4149570	Well Thought Out Twinkies by, or Twinkles.
4150031	4150891	Twinkies would be funny though.
4151292	4155835	Well Thought Out Twinkles by Silver Sun Pickups and Pretty in Pink by Psychedelic Furs.
4156909	4157349	That's cool.
4157590	4158130	You know what, though?
4158190	4158650	Who cares?
4158730	4161953	Because it has Suzy and the Banshees in it, so all the rest of that is just crap.
4167837	4169458	Oh my god, Rob, are you straight now?
4171920	4173161	No, I just love Suzy and the Banshees.
4173181	4173701	They're awesome.
4173901	4175543	She was on the Basement Jack song, too.
4175563	4178905	They had a really cool video on top of it.
4180186	4180606	There you go.
4180626	4181447	It's Kish Cash.
4182970	4189272	It's funny, my band right now, thankfully, because I'm not playing Rock Band 2, but my friend is on my account, so it counts.
4190232	4191593	But we're in the top 600 now.
4192673	4193153	Wow.
4193994	4194374	Dang.
4195074	4195694	Yes, I know.
4196154	4198155	I'm very pleased at my progress in the game.
4199174	4203257	Oh, just to let people know, our band name at my house is Detachable Penis.
4204298	4205218	Like the King Missile song.
4205239	4206119	Did it not get banned?
4206720	4206840	No.
4207300	4207800	Interesting.
4209101	4211523	The one I've been playing in mostly is actually Shane's band.
4211563	4212524	It's Emergency Kittens.
4213444	4214225	That's the name of our band.
4214365	4215966	Does the Sassy Squad sing backup?
4216206	4216446	No.
4217547	4218308	That's just a Warcraft.
4218328	4220950	But is Fluffles Chainset III the lead singer?
4221050	4221170	No.
4221230	4221290	No.
4221980	4229804	Alright, hey, by the way, if you want a real band game, you know, the hell with Rock Band or Guitar Hero, get Rock Revolution.
4229844	4230244	No, I'm kidding.
4230264	4231225	I'm just so kidding.
4231525	4232345	No, you want this.
4232966	4237388	Strong Bad Episode 3, the baddest of the bands, is coming out.
4237608	4238388	It's Episode 3.
4238629	4240329	It comes out on the PC and WiiWare.
4240570	4240850	When?
4241230	4241670	Right now.
4242230	4243711	Or Monday, for those of you listening live.
4243751	4244231	It's tomorrow.
4244632	4245672	October 27th.
4245732	4248193	It's going to be, as always, 1,000 Wii Points or $10.
4248274	4250695	That's coming out from Telltale Games.
4251909	4252369	So there you have it.
4252389	4255230	Those of you that are enjoying the Strong Bad games probably want to pick that up.
4255690	4258671	And if you haven't picked up a Strong Bad game yet, you might want to do that.
4259051	4262732	And yes, I'm talking to myself because I still have not played the Strong Bad series.
4262792	4263752	I really need to.
4263972	4265153	Is the ban over, Rob?
4265853	4267233	No, you know your boycott's not over yet.
4267293	4268274	No, I can play it on PC.
4268834	4269294	That's right.
4269534	4270394	So that's what I plan to do.
4270674	4272795	Oh, your boycott because your memory's full.
4273126	4275147	Yeah, I'm boycotting the Wii download stuff.
4275247	4276927	But although, well, I don't know.
4277367	4279948	I'm iffy on it because they have announced the remedy for it.
4280628	4283089	Wait, have you already announced that on the show, what the remedy is?
4283249	4286610	Yeah, they did announce they are going to let you run things off SD cards.
4286710	4287970	But when's that happening, though?
4288050	4288690	I don't know.
4288710	4289871	That's going to be a patch, right?
4290111	4290931	Yeah, probably a patch.
4291792	4295854	Alright, anyhow, hey, we're not even halfway done with this show yet, if you can believe it.
4295874	4306618	We're going to take a break here pretty soon, but first, we always like to end Part A of our program by taking a trip to the past and revisiting the archives and trying to pick out a classic game of the week.
4306999	4314742	Now, as I understand, though, tonight's game, because it is Episode 300, DarkSakura had to pick, like, a fucking epic classic.
4315142	4315522	Am I correct?
4315542	4315962	You sure did.
4316162	4317163	Alright, well, let's get to it.
4320450	4324754	My classic game, actually I'm not going to say the title of it to begin with.
4325554	4327236	It should begin with the intro to the game.
4328036	4331259	Which everyone will get from the first tones.
4332059	4334922	And I'm getting grins from over here looking at my laptop.
4336183	4336643	Oh my god.
4338224	4338685	Oh my god.
4354564	4355004	Oh yeah!
4355264	4356805	Do we get it yet, kids?
4357526	4358246	Oh yeah!
4358867	4360328	No, it's not Castlevania!
4361729	4362849	It's Guts Man!
4364611	4365051	Oh yeah!
4365091	4368133	Tora is the first person to guess.
4368233	4369774	And stop spamming the room now, please.
4370295	4371475	You get a no prize!
4372436	4372916	Stop it!
4372976	4374718	Okay, someone kick Tora out of the chat room, please.
4376699	4377900	Right the fuck now.
4379042	4380242	Can you read about the classic game now?
4380262	4380923	Thank you.
4381763	4382043	Okay.
4382543	4387865	The classic game is Final Fantasy VI, which we got over here on Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy III.
4388285	4390606	Play the best music in the game ever, please.
4393006	4395807	This is the overworld music, which is also called Terra's Theme.
4396427	4398088	Although in the Japanese version, her name was Tina.
4404451	4405473	Best music in the game.
4405573	4405833	Sorry.
4406114	4408016	That's just my own opinion.
4408217	4410159	And Sauce's best game ever.
4410820	4413484	I think this is probably one of the best video game songs ever.
4413504	4413825	Period.
4413845	4417791	This game is the reason why I skipped a week of high school.
4419423	4421804	While I had the flu, but that's beside the point.
4422085	4423505	My flu was prolonged.
4423906	4430009	No, no, I started off having the flu, and my grandma rented the game for me, and I ended up just having the flu a little bit longer than I really did.
4430589	4439955	But the one thing about this one is it was the first in the series that was not done by Sakaguchi, it was done by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito.
4441215	4447339	And this is considered pretty much the pinnacle of it, although I really, really like Final Fantasy V a whole lot, too.
4448119	4477562	um it has the largest playable cast of any Final Fantasy game to date so um pretty much it's it's standard Final Fantasy you know you have your overworld map and you have your dungeons and you have your towns and um you've got your chocobo and you have your airship and random encounters on land um this one also has um your espers which are you know give you your magic and you keep improving and
4479124	4480665	and it's still menu-based combat.
4480685	4483388	I mean, it's Final Fantasy, basically.
4483408	4498122	There were a few different innovative attacks, like Sully's had the runic attack, which could reflect magical attacks back at somebody, although I'll be honest, I rarely ever freaking use that, except for that one battle where you had to.
4499103	4502287	Um, and I'm actually still playing this right now too.
4503067	4515380	Um, but this has, um, for the active time battle system, you actually can pick any character that has filled up their action bar and you don't have to pick the first one that pops up.
4515420	4521185	You can actually change out which one you want to use as long as their bar is, is their first.
4521205	4521245	Um,
4522566	4542677	and this actually was incorporated into later ones you could customize your characters by your relics to change their stats you could you know work with their spells a little bit you could equip their magicite which is like I was saying is basically some of the espers helps with magic they have the magic acquisition points for each time you gain a
4543257	4544378	AP as you level up.
4545159	4559492	This particular game is where basically you've got this one girl named Tara in the Japanese version, it was Tina, and they find her and she can do magic and everyone's like, oh my god, magic!
4559552	4560173	I'm gonna barf!
4560993	4562415	And then the rest of the story goes off.
4562935	4568360	This also has Kefka, which is the most annoying...
4569541	4573065	laugh in a video game ever.
4574287	4576349	Somebody poison the water hole.
4577250	4580714	But he had the best boss theme ever.
4581935	4583737	Actually, I really like Jenova's better, but anyway.
4584798	4584859	Um...
4586509	4590450	The one other really cool thing that I thought about this game is that it's very steampunk.
4591010	4591590	Really, it is.
4592391	4597252	I mean, you've got steam-powered mecha in the game.
4597332	4598992	It's all very early industrial.
4599112	4600493	Magitek.
4600573	4601613	You have your Magitek armor.
4602013	4610295	You've got, you know, the Empire in that is pretty much a magical, industrial-type mesh.
4610355	4611235	I know, it's so fantastic.
4611255	4612036	And you have toilets in it.
4612056	4612756	You can use the toilet.
4612816	4613216	Did you know that?
4614205	4615406	What if you don't use the toilet?
4615426	4617849	Because in Sims, that's not good.
4617989	4618189	No.
4618549	4625936	If you're in the Empire Castle, whatever, and you're in one of the cells, you can actually sit on the toilet and squat down on it.
4626437	4629099	And then when you hop off the toilet, it flushes.
4630401	4632703	Do they take down their little pants to do that?
4633864	4634024	What?
4634824	4635605	No, they have a trap door.
4635765	4636165	They do?
4636446	4637026	Okay.
4637346	4640209	Also, Saw says it has the freakiest clown in a video game ever.
4641711	4643752	But you've got some of the best characters in this.
4643813	4652140	Like, you've got... I actually really liked... Go-Go.
4652701	4653502	I really liked Go-Go.
4654082	4656024	Because of the weird stuff he did.
4656124	4658366	I loved Gal, who was the little...
4667812	4670556	I don't know why we're having mic issues in the studio.
4670616	4670857	Is it?
4671097	4672279	I'll keep it away from the speakers.
4672319	4672759	I'm sorry.
4673000	4674462	But Rob, do me a favor and...
4676138	4676818	All right, I'll try to find it.
4676938	4685902	But this game had the single most hardcore awesome character in it, which was... We'll get to him in a second.
4685942	4688083	But the main characters you have, Terra slash Tina.
4688543	4690423	You've got Locke, who's your thief.
4690503	4692684	You have Sillies, who's... Treasure Hunter.
4693725	4694225	Whatever.
4694725	4698667	You have Sabin, who's your martial artist.
4698687	4700287	This is a special rendition of it.
4700567	4700907	Oh, no, wait.
4700967	4701428	No, here we go.
4701448	4701728	Here we go.
4702028	4702328	Never mind.
4702568	4702868	Here we go.
4704029	4704709	But here's the man.
4714590	4718112	Shadow the Ninja, who we used to call Snake Eyes.
4719653	4722675	And you have, Realm was cool, she had the drawing attack.
4722735	4729699	And you had her grandfather, who's the Blue Mage, and you had What's-His-Face, who looked like Billy B. Williams.
4732281	4733762	Who was the Doma Castle guy.
4735609	4736129	Oh, Cyan.
4736149	4736369	Yeah.
4736609	4739090	But he looked like Billy... We used to call him Billy Dee.
4739110	4740450	Sorry, he looks like Billy Dee Williams.
4740470	4741210	He doesn't drink cold 45.
4741770	4742450	Edgar was the best.
4742470	4743070	I bet he does.
4743290	4746751	Edgar was awesome because it was all about the autocross bow.
4746991	4747931	And the autocross bow.
4748011	4748791	And the chainsaw.
4749131	4749931	And the chainsaw.
4750171	4751612	The drill.
4751772	4761013	The graphics actually were... The characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano and they were actually converted to sprite.
4761993	4762154	And...
4767071	4777918	There were also, in the PlayStation version that came out later, the actual videos that were in the game were directly from Amano's designs.
4777938	4778818	I thought it was pretty cool.
4779559	4790045	And it was one of the, it's not the first one that used Mode 7, but it used extensive Mode 7 in this for lots of scaling and scrolling.
4790065	4791546	It was really fantastic.
4792227	4801022	When it was localized, there were changes like a little bit of nudity, for example.
4801803	4804228	One of the painting bosses.
4804798	4805899	Yes, one of those.
4807941	4810823	Also, different characters for their full names.
4811183	4815607	They romanized them differently so that they would fit a six-character slot.
4815867	4824233	They were also changed quite a bit from Terra to Tina, from Mash to Sabin, from Kyan to Cyan.
4826542	4833065	but I think that they picked it in the way that people would most be able to relate to it.
4834465	4834905	Text.
4835666	4853233	A lot of dialogue was shortened because, again, it could only store a certain number of characters and I'm sorry, Japanese lends itself a lot easier to extended conversation within a limited character allotment because it's syllabic and English isn't.
4855474	4855654	This
4856932	4857614	is so awesome.
4870270	4878234	This is the opera scene, which is, to this day, I think, one of the most memorable ever scenes in any video game ever.
4878615	4880416	It brings tears to most classic game shows.
4880436	4881156	It really is.
4881616	4892903	Did you see, I saw where they did for the Dear Friends concert, Rob, where they did the opera scene in Japanese.
4894504	4895384	I saw YouTube of it.
4895424	4897105	It was just fantastic.
4897225	4898146	It was so beautiful.
4899526	4907130	And here's actually one that we should realize about the music.
4907150	4908791	We've kept bringing up the music during this.
4908891	4921837	It was actually done by Uematsu, who wrote all of the music in the game, did everything for every location, all the battles, different themes.
4922297	4926739	I actually use the music from the games in Japanese music classes in Japan.
4929477	4943003	Also, they wanted to use an actual voice for the opera, but the SBC-700 chip would not allow an actual voice track, so that's why they used...
4946516	4956258	Well, it would basically be the Vox Organa, or Vox Humana thing for organ, is what I recognize it as.
4956418	4965260	Well, the sound chip itself didn't support the voices, but later on you had games like Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean that did have actual voice samples.
4965780	4967581	But we're talking about full vocal track.
4969341	4970861	It wouldn't support a full vocal track.
4970941	4973022	It would support something that was short.
4975639	4977541	True enough.
4977561	4979602	The Last Metroid is in captivity.
4980123	4981524	The Galaxy is at peace.
4981544	4982705	It's about as much as you can get.
4983345	4986227	Or the Clay Fighters opening.
4988309	4999737	But for the Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale album, it actually was rearranged as an aria using an actual singer in full...
5001678	5007040	Accompaniment, and this version was also in the full motion video in the PlayStation version, so it was pretty cool.
5009481	5024986	You can actually get, I've got the full soundtrack to this, you can get all kinds of arranged versions, but there's also some pretty good versions of some of the music in the game in some of the Final Fantasy compilation discs.
5027509	5033290	Although I still think that the best of the compilation ones, which I don't think has any from this game in it, is still Celtic Moon.
5033830	5034190	And Prey.
5034230	5034870	Prey was very good.
5034890	5036931	Prey had some stuff in here.
5037371	5046112	We did, like I said, we got a PlayStation version, but there's also Final Fantasy VI Advance, which came out on DS.
5046172	5051093	There's four new espers in this one, which is Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactar, and Diabolos.
5051793	5052774	Cactar!
5053014	5054734	I think it was on Game Boy Advance.
5055495	5056636	Sorry, that's the Game Boy Advance one.
5057076	5058236	I wish it was on DS, that'd be awesome.
5058296	5061237	Yeah, well that's the one I've been playing through until my DS broke.
5063618	5081446	Also, for this game, as of March 31st, 2003, it shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide, which is 2.6 million in Japan alone, and 860,000 overseas, and continued to be one of the best-selling games.
5081906	5082967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5096843	5123779	and this is what made me all hyper is that when I don't know if you remember when the Nintendo 64 was in production or sorry in testing they actually made a demonstration for the Nintendo 64 using the the cast from Final Fantasy 7 in a big battle I think versus Bahamut which I found video of finally and it's freaking crazy looking
5124119	5125519	Which is what we're looking at right now in studio.
5125819	5131361	It was going to be too expensive, right, to put it on a cartridge to do the game, right, for Final Fantasy VII?
5132381	5137622	Well, basically, it was actually done on Silicon Graphics hardware when they first put it out.
5138823	5145204	But Square hadn't yet committed, and the technology in the game was not up to their parts.
5145244	5148065	They actually wanted to move it to PlayStation for the sake of full motion video.
5149586	5163221	Which the PlayStation of course could easily handle But the demo actually had Terra, Locke, and Shadow And it was controlled actually through using a mouse
5164182	5168024	instead of, you know, actual, like with a control.
5168384	5186532	There was also Final Fantasy VI, the interactive CG game, which was actually also called Final Fantasy X, not a Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X, which was the same demonstration, but with better textures.
5186652	5188093	Not for the Philips CD-i, right?
5188473	5188693	Oh, no.
5189073	5193095	This was basically... We're going on an adventure, Zelda!
5193675	5195816	But this was basically what they were using.
5196917	5205482	It was a sort of a touchdown version they were using for the Nintendo 64 demo test.
5205922	5213306	But this was more to demonstrate the actual use of CG in the thing.
5213326	5215107	So that's pretty cool.
5215747	5219770	So that's our classic game is Final Fantasy VI.
5220478	5221759	Oh good, because I was running out of music.
5221879	5222399	That was long.
5222439	5222899	That's alright.
5223080	5223600	It's worth it.
5223860	5224841	That game deserves it.
5225281	5234386	I knew that this game would require a ton of attention, so how could we not dedicate more time to it?
5234767	5235747	And it's episode 300.
5236107	5237608	I mean, hell, we have to pick the pinnacle.
5238009	5238429	Alright.
5239209	5240790	I don't know how you're going to follow that next week.
5241130	5241431	Alright.
5241531	5243472	Because it's not better than Super Metroid.
5244261	5246462	Final Fantasy 6 Final Fantasy 5 Final Fantasy 6
5265149	5270736	A whole lot, and I'll probably do that as a later game, because of how customizable the job change system was.
5271036	5275401	And Final Fantasy 3 was the first one to do that, of the Japanese releases.
5275822	5277303	Which was actually really fun, too.
5277323	5279166	If anyone can find a translation of it, play it.
5279206	5279786	It's fantastic.
5279806	5280868	Well, they've got it on DS.
5280888	5282369	They have it now, but I mean like the old...
5283110	5283530	The old one.
5285292	5293157	Final Fantasy 6, I think, for storytelling, for just how drawn in it brings you into everything, for all the detail.
5293517	5294738	I mean, flushing toilets.
5295138	5296899	A first for any Final Fantasy game.
5298420	5302943	With the opera, by the time you get to the opera, there's like this epic, crazy stuff.
5303023	5306966	And so much has gone on already, and you're like, oh my god, this is some crazy adventure.
5307246	5312850	Plus, it's all about the X-Zone.
5314331	5319055	Vanish Doom Vanish Doom or Vanish X-Zone Both of them But it was all about that, hi
5324653	5330935	Alright, we gotta wrap up or we're gonna have no time for Skype calls in Part B. We're gonna move on and take a break, but hey, don't go away.
5330975	5338818	There'll be plenty more of Orange Launch Radio, some more news coming in Part B. We've got a new technology Microsoft might be building so that people will stop swearing on Xbox Live.
5339318	5341019	I can't wait to see what people have to say about this.
5341039	5341379	Yeah, I know.
5341419	5341899	Aw, fuck.
5342199	5342539	Alright.
5343860	5347841	So anyway, we'll be talking about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5351604	5357849	And for those of you guys listening live tonight, we have, for tonight's free break, your shout-outs from our voicemail.
5357889	5358349	So enjoy.
5358389	5360351	We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Launch Radio.
5368818	5369618	Hey, all our crew.
5369819	5370659	Happy 300th day.
5370879	5373562	It's the turn of more albums of all our lessons for you, year 68.
5373722	5374042	P.S.
5374562	5379987	This voicemail is brought to you by the All Our Tavern, on the never-ending transport and DMN case.
5381499	5382580	Hey, hey, hey!
5382980	5383500	What's up?
5383560	5384541	Dan Shadow here.
5385181	5385541	So, 300.
5386602	5387863	Episode 300.
5388243	5388723	Wow.
5388743	5388723	300.
5389244	5390404	Really?
5391105	5393526	I can't even get one.
5393546	5394267	Can I get one?
5395247	5395788	Just one.
5396488	5396728	Really?
5396788	5396868	No?
5396888	5397048	But 300.
5397088	5397929	Wow, man.
5397969	5398169	Cool.
5398189	5398289	Yeah.
5398309	5398289	300.
5398509	5398589	Sure.
5398649	5398829	Okay.
5400050	5400190	Bye.
5410382	5413004	Okay, hi, it's Gold Ampro.
5413625	5417808	I haven't really left a message to talk to you guys for a while.
5417948	5424413	And even though I'm probably going to be there, I'm probably not going to be there because of stupid school reasons.
5424533	5429437	So, I hope you guys, the 300th episode is really good and I'll listen to it on the podcast.
5429777	5433640	Anyway, real quickly, I want to tell my game spots to stop scoring.
5433920	5435902	Basically, there's one for the whiteboard.
5436242	5446071	I went to my mom a couple months ago, and what happened was, um, well, um, I got sent.
5446811	5456300	We were waiting in line, and the lady was, we had to wait there 10 minutes, they were ignoring us, and we were at the front of the line at the counter.
5456680	5458722	And then they had to nerve-jack, um,
5460802	5463724	In order to ask, do you want to buy an Edge card with that?
5463744	5465025	Because it's a 10% discount.
5465386	5466226	And Mom's like, no.
5466626	5467407	And then we walk out.
5467927	5472951	I mean, after making us wait for 10 minutes, we could tell they were pretty much deliberately ignoring us.
5473712	5478536	And, you know, I know today's busy, but, I mean, it's just so annoying.
5480317	5485361	So there's one for the game's spot, stop, whatever, message board thing.
5485381	5486742	Sorry it was a little over a minute.
5487600	5490883	What's up Orange Lounge Radio, this is Tire Claw.
5491303	5494485	I'd like to congratulate you all for the 300th episode.
5495066	5498028	Keep up the good fight and take care, alright?
5498308	5499349	Well, happy 300th!
5499409	5502571	Or, how do you say it in French?
5502611	5503352	Joyeux 300th!
5503372	5503772	Oh well, hell.
5507886	5512790	Anyway, hi there Olar, this is Aki Ripper just calling you to say Happy 300!
5512970	5515272	Eller Gratulerar på 300-programsdagen!
5519144	5519905	That was Swedish.
5520365	5521826	So, hello, hello.
5522246	5524348	Y'all just had a later date.

5697711	5698051	What?
5698752	5700913	We have to wish Orange Dawn Radio a happy 300th.

5708398	5718865	And on behalf of the staff at Anime Jam Sessions, which is me, Kuro, and Sailor Flurry, we want to congratulate Rob, Jamie, and Loki on an awesome 300th episode tonight.
5718885	5718945	Yay!
5719565	5720826	Oh my god, 300 episodes!
5720846	5722167	What are you guys gonna do now?
5722207	5723188	Like, go to Disney World?
5723308	5723688	I hope not.
5724168	5725489	They've already done Disney World.
5726150	5727531	I know, it's so overrated.
5728351	5730433	I know, but tonight, I'm gonna listen.
5730513	5733074	I'm gonna have a drink based on each one of them.
5733094	5734696	So it'll be some awesome fun tonight.
5735216	5737277	You're gonna, like, be totally plastered.
5737337	5738158	I feel bad for you.
5738298	5739239	I'm not gonna be plastered.
5739319	5739819	Yes, you are.
5740019	5740480	No, I'm not.
5740740	5741740	Yes, you are.
5741780	5743582	No, I'm not.
5743682	5746864	Or... Hey, why don't, instead of arguing, why don't you come into the chatroom tonight?
5747384	5747865	Okay.
5748772	5749172	It'll be fun.
5749212	5749973	It depends.
5749993	5751395	Definitely.
5751875	5752396	Yeah.
5752436	5758421	So, Rob, Matt, Jamie, have a great show tonight, and you know I'll be there and see you for episode 301.
5758462	5758802	Woohoo!
5758842	5761404	Can you tell we're excited?
5761925	5763506	A little bit excited.
5764167	5764668	Just a little bit?
5764688	5765829	Just a little bit.
5766209	5767090	Alright, awesome.
5767490	5768331	Have a good show tonight.
5768391	5768812	See you later.
5777657	5782381	From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!
5782802	5783102	Holler!
5783142	5783603	Holler!
5783663	5784263	Holler!
5784503	5784704	Holler!
5784744	5785024	Holler!
5792349	5798972	Welcome back, everybody, to episode number 300 of Orange Lounge Radio on this Sunday evening, October the 26th, 2008.
5799352	5816199	Just a reminder, there will be no show next week just due to the fact that, hey, we deserve a week off after 300 episodes and the fact that I'm having surgery and I'm being held up by Loki dressed as Sackboy, which you can see on our Justin TV feed at justin.tv slash Orange Lounge Radio.
5817299	5818680	This is orange-tipped gunny-o.
5818800	5821403	He's holding up the Justin listeners with a gun.
5821423	5822204	That's lovely.
5822244	5823145	Where did you get a gun?
5825125	5827006	It's his airsoft.
5827266	5827566	Oh, okay.
5827606	5828546	I'm like, where in the hell?
5828626	5829786	Who got you a gun?
5830546	5832207	Rob, I have airsoft guns.
5832447	5832727	All right.
5832887	5834827	The little Resident Evil pistols.
5835267	5835627	All right.
5836527	5839148	Anyhow, I know we want to get to the Skype line.
5839168	5840608	We've got a lot of people who want to call in tonight.
5840628	5842229	We're going to try and take as many calls as possible.
5842269	5843869	But first, we've got a little more news to get to.
5844309	5845129	And Loki, you ready?
5845549	5846069	Situated there?
5846109	5847270	Ready to get us back into some gaming news?
5847490	5848070	Yeah, of course.
5848410	5848730	All righty.
5849030	5849330	All right.
5849890	5861558	So, starting things off as I kind of hinted to earlier, Panda Arcade Adventures Episode 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PC on October 29th.
5863154	5864355	That's awesome news.
5864816	5871322	No word on PS3 yet, probably just because they just finally got the first episode, so give it a little bit more time.
5871522	5877007	But it will be $15 on both platforms, and it will be all sorts of awesome.
5877868	5880430	It better be based on that recommendation.
5881531	5882512	Well, it's supposed to be.
5882652	5886156	The first one was kind of fun, so we'll see why the second one wouldn't be as well.
5886840	5895428	Well, one thing you might not be getting to do when you play this game online, even though you don't really play this game online, but other Xbox Live games would be, you probably won't get to swear much longer.
5896269	5903076	Apparently, the US Patent Office has granted a patent to Microsoft for real-time censoring of audio streams.
5903636	5905318	So, you know, this is...
5905758	5917328	Pretty self-explanatory, probably what Microsoft wants us for is they want to be able to censor what Xbox Live is probably most known for, is the fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, you know, and all that stuff that you hear when you go on Xbox Live.
5917828	5919110	By the way, they can't censor this show.
5919230	5919610	Ha-ha.
5920471	5923313	Fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
5924554	5925235	You know what, though?
5925255	5925375	Fuck!
5926670	5927570	You know what?
5927790	5933532	A writer on Ars Technica, though, Jonathan Gitlin, though, brings up a really kind of scary point.
5933592	5935833	Think about this, because this is the technology, right?
5936493	5939634	I can also envisage a much sinister role, however.
5939974	5942515	Imagine the same system applied to digital telephony.
5942875	5946057	Then think how valuable such a system might be to an authoritarian regime.
5947857	5954121	As we've seen to good effect in Burma and elsewhere, the ubiquity of cell phones has been a good thing for dissidents who need to get their message out or organize themselves.
5954501	5958524	The Great Firewall of China already blocks objectionable web content from reaching Chinese computers.
5958844	5962607	What's to stop cell phones from censoring anti-government conversations too?
5963027	5964488	That is kind of a scary thought.
5964708	5969451	Let's hope that this isn't used for, you know, anything pushing the limits.
5969551	5970412	I can imagine this is...
5971513	5974395	It's going to be a scary thing if it falls into the wrong hands.
5974535	5975936	Jani brings up an interesting point.
5976036	5976616	What's that in chat?
5976636	5979078	Imagine censoring the angry video game nerd.
5980939	5982580	Well, still, just anything.
5982820	5983920	It kind of threatens free speech.
5983981	5986002	His powers are beyond Microsoft's comprehension.
5986802	5987603	If in the wrong hands.
5988123	5994867	Again, in this country, since free speech is in our constitution, I don't think it's going to be a big problem, but it could be interesting to see the effect this could have in other places.
5994907	5995908	I think the guy makes a good point.
5995948	5996988	What if it falls into the wrong hands?
5997369	6000510	But also, I can't imagine that this is going to be...
6001638	6002738	That accurate.
6003018	6003599	You know what I mean?
6004239	6004679	There'll be ways.
6004839	6006260	Will it catch me if I say frack?
6006760	6009941	The thing is... What if I'm talking about my shih tzu dog?
6010201	6011041	Am I going to get censored?
6011061	6020884	The thing is, Rob, about free speech rights... Yeah, the government can't inhibit your free speech rights, but companies sure can when you agree to play by their rules.
6021025	6021545	Exactly.
6021605	6024766	As long as you've signed the agreement saying that you're going to use their...
6025666	6037752	proprietary software, and I guess the hardware too since we're referring to the Xbox, then they do have a right to censor any content that comes through their own equipment.
6037792	6043975	It's just like a private organization denying people the use of their facilities.
6044423	6044823	Exactly.
6045263	6050286	Alright, I get that, I get that, but still, I'm going to be very disappointed since I pay for Microsoft service if I can't say fuck.
6050726	6062171	However, knowing Microsoft and based on track history only, I'm going to assume it'll probably be a switch that'll, you know, help keep it safe for kids, which I'm cool with, you know, if parents want to turn it on, but they shouldn't rely on it.
6062632	6065493	That's the other dangerous thing, is I don't want parents to rely on it.
6065513	6073017	I would love to see it like, you know, some of those TBS comedies where they replace it with, like, stupid words, just like ordinary things.
6073037	6073717	What the freak?
6074197	6074897	What the fruit?
6075498	6077098	What the French toast?
6078419	6080540	Shove it up your baloney.
6082221	6082841	Or kazoo.
6082861	6090845	To be perfectly honest, the whole reason that swear words are considered swear words in the beginning is because people have given them the power to offend.
6091485	6095347	And what is it that I have been saying for a very long time now?
6095667	6097087	You find this show very offensive.
6097267	6097708	Oh, whatever.
6098168	6099148	Learn to be offended.
6099689	6102030	The less of a big deal you make out of it...
6103190	6104170	The less it's going to matter.
6104310	6104851	I mean, really.
6105691	6112453	The whole reason that I think little kids think it's fun to go out and cuss from their little kids is because their parents say, oh, that's bad and you shouldn't do it.
6113093	6116194	The less you're allowed to do something, the more you'll want to do it.
6116554	6117194	Exactly.
6118415	6120715	People do that because it raises eyebrows.
6122296	6126217	But if no one gets offended, why would they want to do it anymore?
6126557	6133160	I would love to see Microsoft I would love to see Microsoft just try and censor this next segment of ours.
6134921	6141844	Yeah, Fuse of the Week.
6149909	6168227	Fuck you with something hard and sandpapery to, um, certain, um, closed-minded, tight-assed, bigoted conservatives that have been, um,
6170356	6173678	F you to other things that are personal and F you to my hair
6187597	6187877	Loki.
6188858	6193281	Fe to Sackboy for being so fluffy, because fluffy equals hot.
6193402	6195623	You're kind of fluffy, Loki.
6195843	6196384	I am kind of fluffy.
6196564	6198686	That's why I didn't have to pad the front, just the arms.
6198706	6201268	Yeah, no needing to pad myself.
6201688	6208233	Well, that is really friggin' hot, but actually, luckily the sweatshirt is quite thin, so it's not too bad.
6208373	6214478	I actually have, like, jeans under the pants and another t-shirt under this shirt, so...
6216351	6216691	Alright.
6216731	6217772	But the head's really fucking hot.
6217812	6218973	Can't do anything with the head.
6219493	6219873	My turn?
6220314	6220474	Yes.
6220514	6220774	Yay.
6221194	6227478	I want to say F you to the people that decided to call me faggot yesterday while I was out protesting Prop 8.
6228179	6230160	We were out there on the streets holding signs.
6230240	6233082	You know, I had a big thing that said, you know, protect civil rights and all that stuff.
6233102	6239166	There was a group of us out there and some guy as he drove by decided to yell faggots and throw candy corn at us.
6239486	6242088	Because that's the world we live in, folks.
6242108	6244230	No, I don't know whether to be angry or happy.
6244250	6244710	It's like,
6246651	6248552	And one hand, I'm offended by what you said.
6248572	6249793	And the other hand, candy corn!
6250793	6252894	Not when they've fallen on a dirty-ass street.
6253314	6255275	Oh, that's just unacceptable.
6255595	6258457	So not only did he say faggot, Loki, he wasted candy corn.
6259537	6259737	Oh, no!
6259777	6261838	You don't waste candy corn.
6261918	6271983	I'm sorry, is it wrong for me to mention that we're supposed to learn to stop throwing things and having food fights when we're in kindergarten? !
6272765	6276866	Yeah, and then, oh, yeah, and then the lady as she was coming out of the drive-thru.
6277146	6279347	No, here's the best one, the lady coming out of the drive-thru.
6279827	6281148	Faggots, you're all going to hell.
6281988	6283148	That's what she yelled at us.
6283168	6284088	They should have thrown Skittles.
6284128	6285009	No, you know what I said?
6285149	6287129	I yelled back, I said, God loves a bigot too.
6287930	6289210	That's what I said back to her.
6289370	6290550	Then she drove off, pissed off.
6290911	6291211	Good.
6291451	6292351	So, um...
6293428	6299257	and so don't sit there and tell me this proposition isn't about hate and discrimination because I'll tell you what, I've seen it right in the face and it is.
6300819	6302602	Alright, moving on.
6302642	6305086	Some real quick FUs from our guests because we have a lot in studio.
6305106	6306188	We'll start with Drew since he has a mic.
6306522	6312443	Alright, F you to my student government for being assholes about the whole proposition thing.
6312463	6312764	Agreed.
6313064	6313724	I didn't vote them in.
6314884	6319465	And they're trying to speak for the entire student body and I don't like it one bit.
6319845	6322646	Actually, to go with this, I might have mentioned this earlier.
6323086	6326007	There was a girl who was driving in front of me leaving school.
6326387	6327287	We go to the same school.
6328327	6333168	And she wrote on her car, no to Prop 8, the ARC student council does not represent me.
6334629	6335309	I approve of that.
6336260	6346808	but also F you to people who are taking the zombie event in WoW a little too far and taking hordes and hordes of zombies people taking WoW too far?
6346828	6363540	into the lobby zones and killing all the lobbies who are trying to start out that's not cool I mean, yeah, it's zombies and it's brains but it's not cool don't be a dick alright, Hiccup Boy do you have any F yous of the week?
6364818	6370122	I'm going to send an FU toward the bimbo of politicians everywhere.
6371142	6377747	And I don't even think I need to go any further with that because everybody should know who I'm talking about.
6378367	6379528	So I shall pass the mic on.
6380469	6380929	Arcadian42.
6380949	6384111	Fuck you to 65-hour work weeks.
6384151	6384731	They suck.
6385532	6389615	They put me way, way behind on everything.
6391036	6392416	Oh well, getting money is good.
6393277	6393857	Money is good.
6394078	6394378	Doctor.
6394994	6396835	DarkSakura, take us back to some gaming news
6413614	6414735	Stuff happened, the end.
6416496	6426262	Ubisoft is actually working on the latest Anno game and actually have had to push it back a little bit.
6427443	6433947	As well as one that they have literally called an as-yet-unannounced franchise.
6434467	6437349	They were going to release it 2008-2009 fiscal year, but it's actually going to be 2009-2010.
6441191	6465591	we don't know what this is but I know 1404 is a settlement building game that speaks for itself there's a trailer around if someone wants to look at game trailers I'm sure there's one there but the other one they're not saying what it is but they said that it's an unannounced one so maybe it's a brand new franchise could be
6468533	6479298	Well, something that unfortunately hasn't been delayed is an update to the Wii firmware that's now disabling the Homebrew channel from being installed.
6480158	6486241	Other possible problems faced with that are some Homebrew programs not running.
6486862	6496046	Also, the video player that they had that also allowed you to watch DVDs is not working as well, the M player.
6497578	6525323	and um right now though if you do have the homebrew channel installed you're fine but you won't be able to install it if you um you know do 3.3 also in Japan um they have um the shop channel down right now for maintenance as they're changing all the references to Wii points to Nintendo points and other uh pre-DSI maintenance isn't that a little deceiving though because the points aren't going to be interchangeable that strikes me as kind of dumb it is deceiving yes um
6526445	6533386	And then also apparently right now, if you don't update your system, you will not be able to access the shop channel.
6533867	6541368	Which is ironic because if you think about it, if they're not able to access the shop channel, they won't buy your crap that you're selling online.
6541568	6548790	And you know, with the homebrew stuff, it is easy to, I don't know, pirate said games that you're offering on the service.
6548890	6554631	I would think that you would want to allow people to be able to purchase your games and let them have fun with the homebrew stuff since...
6555965	6558727	Give these homebrew people jobs.
6558767	6561168	Unfortunately, there's a lot of might-be-crap games on the Wii.
6580592	6582733	Well, I can see the other side, though.
6582753	6584453	People stealing other people's work by pirating such games.
6584473	6584893	Don't lie.
6584913	6586994	This is what a lot of the quote-unquote homebrew people do.
6587014	6588555	I can see both sides of it, though.
6605285	6608166	Do you remember the old school game show Supermarket Sweep?
6631089	6631849	Dude, that's this.
6631869	6633110	That's the greatest ever.
6633270	6633710	That's this.
6633750	6635971	Look, there's a little trailer here we're playing in studio.
6638012	6638912	It's, yeah.
6640833	6642254	Lifetime, Lawnmowers Unpacked.
6642494	6642934	But look at this.
6643154	6651277	You actually run around the supermarket with your cart, but you pick up plungers for some weird reason, and you run into other shoppers.
6652318	6655479	But yeah, it's everything you've always wanted to do in the supermarket.
6657568	6658969	They're all kind of crazy anime characters.
6659770	6660390	So there you have it.
6661091	6665093	It's like Supermarket Sweep meets Jet Set Radio or something like that.
6665273	6673319	By the way, according to Juan Grill, who's the studio manager for the developers, Joju Games, he says that MartRacer was inspired from the shape of the Wiimote.
6673339	6677721	He says, quote, The first time I grabbed a Wiimote, instinctively I grabbed it with both hands like a bar.
6678022	6681364	That made me start thinking on a game where you can maneuver it like you would be grabbing a bar.
6681864	6682345	So there you go.
6682665	6684788	And if you want to play with a classic controller, you can.
6685169	6692438	But I guess it's probably more fun with motion controls because you can imagine that you're pushing that cart just like a bat out of hell up and down the aisles of Safeway.
6692458	6693320	It'll be lots of fun.
6695199	6695699	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6719728	6722370	Anyhow, what are some other things we can download, DarkSakura?
6723351	6728615	Well, there is a few games coming out on WiiWare in the UK.
6729555	6736740	There's the Incredible Maze, which is 500 Wii points, and it's different.
6736920	6743865	It's mazes and has balance board support, so you actually steer a ball around the maze and dodge traps.
6744226	6747108	Basically, it's Marble Madness with a balance board, from what I understand.
6747128	6747208	Okay.
6747648	6774285	there's also interior design well an interior design game called Home Sweet Home that is you basically take rooms and redesign them sort of like a bizarre puzzle and it's a thousand Wii points and then there's Tetris Party which is twelve hundred Wii points that is mini game Tetris using the balance board and it has online multiplayer for up to six people
6776274	6776514	Click in!
6776534	6776794	Click in!
6776814	6777134	Click in!
6805498	6812983	Other than stuff coming on to the WiiWare service, there's some interesting stuff if you happen to own a Super Nintendo system.
6813563	6822009	Apparently, a German programmer took it upon himself to create a new console game that supports eight players.
6822689	6832996	His creation is a brawler called N-Warp Daisuken, or it looks like Daisakusen, and allows you to plug in two multitaps in the SNES
6835497	6837879	And, yeah, it's pretty awesome.
6837959	6845563	But you can also, if you don't want to, I don't know, say, find a cart for it, since it doesn't look like there is an actual cart, you can play it through an emulator.
6846343	6849005	But, I don't know, that's pretty awesome.
6849085	6853727	Eight-player brawler game for Super Nintendo.
6853967	6862372	If you want to download it, the website is gra.deforce3000.de So that's where you can get that wonderful game.
6863934	6864275	All right.
6865116	6870702	Well, for those of you looking forward to new Nintendo products, Animal Crossing City Focus coming out pretty soon.
6870762	6874587	And a bunch of videos have been kind of shown up around the Internet.
6874907	6878932	And it's revealed a lot more about the game, a lot more details about the new Animal Crossing game.
6879032	6880614	And somewhere Rice Princess is going...
6881375	6882155	Yes, exactly.
6882236	6883216	She loves Animal Crossing.
6883376	6883836	I do too.
6884677	6887258	Although I'm kind of surprised I'm going to be buying this game for the third time.
6887298	6888418	But they have made some changes.
6888718	6891180	It's starting to sound like an MMO though, like a patch or something.
6891800	6894041	At the new auction now, she can't put up fruit or tools.
6895041	6895382	Let's see.
6895502	6897282	New chirping birds will appear in your village.
6897302	6899403	You get clovers brought over in the DS version.
6899764	6903485	A lot of the objects like fossils, tools, and accessories show up as 3D objects.
6903905	6907607	The villages are going to go back to having two different elevation levels like they did in the GameCube.
6908668	6908788	Um...
6909568	6917551	You have stone bridges in the game over the lakes and rivers that are now wider, probably to hold four people when you're playing on Wi-Fi.
6917912	6919892	Mr. Asetti can actually show up in the city.
6920813	6924494	There's more grass in your city than dirt, unlike the DS version.
6925235	6928536	Nook's Cranny and Nook & Go are back as Nook upgrades in the game.
6929937	6931818	There's going to be a Tom Nook apron shirt.
6933458	6936840	Skunk is a character that will shine your shoes and change the color of them.
6937620	6938420	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6966161	6967062	And how's that WeSpeak thing?
6967082	6967522	That'll be fun.
6967542	6968283	It doesn't come with it.
6968463	6969103	It's optional.
6969123	6971525	So I can run around going, You're a towel!
6971985	6972326	Alright.
6973507	6973867	Anyhow.
6973887	6977490	You can go around in these little kids' towels and just go, Fuck!
6980152	6980832	And they'll bleep it out.
6980872	6982874	I wonder if I can get my village lesbian back.
6983614	6984155	You never know.
6984515	6988178	No, on the GameCube one, we had our village lesbian.
6988198	6988778	What was her name?
6988998	6989479	I don't remember.
6989499	6990639	She was an aardvark or something.
6990760	6992461	No, she wasn't an aardvark.
6992901	6993642	She had the huge nose.
6995143	6996344	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7011081	7012962	See, and now you can put a no on eight sign.
7012982	7013563	Because we outed her.
7013603	7014263	Outside there, too.
7014283	7014804	It would be great.
7015564	7017705	I can't wait to put political messages inside Animal Crossing.
7017725	7018946	That's going to be fantastic.
7019126	7019627	Exactly.
7019827	7021628	My God, it's going to turn into Second Life.
7021888	7022128	Vote for me.
7022168	7025511	Remember when we were doing bottle messages to advertise the station?
7025751	7026531	Yes, I remember that.
7026551	7027892	I'm going to throw a furry at you.
7027912	7028893	That would be fun.
7029253	7029734	With signs.
7030394	7030694	All right.
7030734	7033136	What's also totally fun, interacting with our listeners.
7033196	7036178	And every week, you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com.
7036198	7040781	And we read some of our emails live here on air, as DarkSakura is going to do right now.
7045794	7046814	First email.
7046954	7047775	Dun dun dun.
7048495	7049915	Congratulations!
7049955	7052076	You have made it to 300 episodes.
7052116	7052716	Bonus round.
7052776	7053597	Another 300.
7053637	7054537	Ready, set, go.
7055097	7058318	By the way, U is spelled Y-O-U, not the letter U. Thank you.
7058938	7059498	No, really.
7059699	7063600	I, please capitalize your I, must say 300 episodes is freaking epic.
7064520	7065741	You guys are awesome.
7065881	7071924	Awesome has an E in it, by the way, after W. And... God, what am I doing this for?
7072885	7075626	And by far the best gaming podcast out there.
7076006	7078047	You are the most intelligent and comedic, too.
7078588	7086292	If you don't want to read this part, then don't, but I must say, I was listening to back episodes, and if I lived in Cali, I would join the rebellion against Prop 8.
7086652	7087092	Thank you.
7088233	7090214	It is stupid and no better than racism.
7091286	7094869	Off to a better note, I have been playing Jet Set Radio Future for Xbox.
7094929	7099613	I remember this playing back on my uncle's Xbox and it was freaking nostalgic.
7099673	7101555	Nostalgic is N-O-S.
7102656	7102996	Sorry.
7105378	7108902	The game is as good as any 360 game and in some ways better.
7109462	7114186	By the way, if anyone knows where to get the freaking awesome music for JSRF, tell me.
7114286	7114947	I want it now.
7115728	7115788	Um...
7116408	7123153	By the way, just to let you know, they did actually do a soundtrack that they released in... Okay.
7123813	7124354	America.
7124374	7126115	Rawr.
7126315	7128256	I have the Lion Suki on my head now.
7130098	7134721	But you actually can get the soundtrack for that, and we'll talk.
7135341	7139845	I'll see about making sure that you acquire this.
7139885	7141146	Sincerely, Geekboy2424, a.k.a.
7141226	7141966	the youngest OLR listener.
7141986	7142607	300 for the win!
7146989	7150382	Actually, I have to say, how young are you, dude?
7150402	7150864	14, I think he is.
7151286	7152450	That's actually not too bad.
7153659	7154720	The email really not too bad.
7155340	7156441	Just common little things.
7156561	7159823	I still think Sakuramax beats him as far as youngness.
7159863	7161204	Sakuramax is 13, right?
7161624	7161824	Yeah.
7161844	7162864	I think they're the same age.
7162965	7164185	I think they had a birthday.
7164225	7164686	I think they're both 14.
7165266	7165746	I don't remember.
7165826	7166727	They had a birthday.
7166747	7168047	You must fight to the death.
7168268	7169448	One is the evil twin.
7170469	7171850	Look for a kid with a goatee.
7172210	7172890	Two men enter.
7173350	7174091	Two men enter.
7174331	7174971	One man leaves.
7175051	7176452	This is Orange Lounge.
7176712	7177013	Anyway.
7178013	7179034	Hello, OLR.
7180035	7186761	Don't know if you've already covered this in the 299th episode, but just in case, I get a smiley face.
7186881	7188403	It says, here you can get the game.
7188443	7195469	And this is from Ilya, aka 13nextforever, and it's actually about a Metroid 2 remake.
7196570	7197691	It's Project AM2R, where they are...
7205401	7207762	I'm really not sure exactly what's going into it.
7207822	7220745	Oh, they're remaking Metroid 2, like the Game Boy one, in color, I think, looking very... Super Metroid-ish.
7221485	7224466	Yeah, it's very Super Metroid-ish.
7224946	7227147	But the graphics are actually really pretty.
7228007	7229487	I've seen the remake so far.
7229588	7231108	It's very, very well done.
7234197	7237239	I've sent a link to that site in the chat room, by the way.
7239140	7240641	Misty, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7243063	7245625	Don't, you don't, you shouldn't feel old.
7245985	7248287	No, nuh-uh.
7248307	7248347	No.
7248367	7251249	The chatters were talking about how old they were when they started listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7251330	7253131	It was making the hosts feel very old.
7253571	7257214	How old was I when we started doing Orange Lounge Radio?
7257314	7257554	I was 26, 27.
7262639	7266321	I was 23, but I was like three days before my 24th birthday.
7266441	7268343	I was 26 when we started doing this show.
7268503	7269063	Oh my god.
7270304	7271045	Shoot me, Rob.
7271645	7271985	Bang.
7274127	7274707	My mom's turning 50.
7274747	7278610	Happy birthday, Mom!
7279510	7280111	You should call her.
7282372	7287156	Well, we won't be here next week to do it, so... We should call my mom later.
7287356	7287576	Anyway.
7288417	7289197	Oh yeah, email, right?
7290118	7290298	Yes.
7290318	7290378	Yes.
7291207	7295238	So, thank you for that kind, kind email.
7295258	7295640	13X forever.
7297859	7298459	Next one.
7298820	7300401	Oh, God, I don't know who this person is.
7300441	7301081	It's just sauce.
7301461	7301701	Anyway.
7302142	7303062	Hey there, OLR.
7303362	7305224	Congratulations on 300 episodes.
7305384	7311347	In honor of episode 300, I wrote a song for you guys to the tune of Hey There, Delilah by the Plain White Tees.
7311807	7312688	There's a link here.
7313048	7317471	The song runs over two minutes, however, and Rob said to keep it under a minute if we send anything in.
7317791	7322414	She don't have a recording of it quite yet, and she did give us lyrics to it.
7323269	7326193	She posted it on Twitter and I read the parody and it's very cute.
7326833	7329696	I could read it right now unless Rob wants to read it.
7329997	7330798	I'm not going to sing it.
7330818	7334902	I don't have the song also, which is part of the problem.
7336404	7336925	You can read it.
7337485	7337725	Okay.
7338827	7339447	You want me to read it?
7339507	7340609	I don't know how I find it on Twitter.
7340629	7341029	I don't mind.
7341390	7341750	Let me see.
7341890	7342451	Okay, go for it.
7343058	7345181	Hey there, OLR, what's it like in Sacramento?
7345321	7350487	I'm 500 miles away, but now I'll listen to your show just for you No other podcast outshines you, I swear it's true
7360059	7361961	Hey there, OLR, don't you worry about your ratings.
7362001	7364563	Your fans will download your podcast and share it with our friends.
7364623	7365344	We'll tell, too.
7365824	7367806	There's no place else we'd go for news.
7367846	7368466	You know it's true.
7368806	7370928	Oh, 300 episodes, chorus part.
7371609	7373410	I'm not going to repeat it.
7374091	7376332	300 shows seems like a lot, but don't you stop.
7376392	7377033	Give it a shot.
7377473	7378954	I know this show is running kind of late.
7378975	7383818	DarkSakura needs to read FUs, and Loki's got some gaming news, and Bobby makes Sky start the show real late."
7385103	7386065	We have Rob Snicker to that.

7390053	7391336	Okay.

7455880	7460443	I also just finished playing the new Spider-Man Web of Shadows video game that came out this past week.
7460763	7465105	I played the DS version, which is slightly different than the other versions, but it was still super fun.
7465605	7470548	I wrote up a review for your gaming leisure, and I'll just tell this online for everybody.
7471028	7475951	It's AvengersTower.com slash question P equals 38 and I'm going to get the chat room.

7481113	7483974	Anywho, congratulations on 300 episodes, you guys.
7484034	7485574	I'm looking forward to 300 more.
7485915	7486855	Sincerely, Martin.
7487275	7487855	Thank you.
7488435	7494857	And I am going to... Wow, if we did 300 more, we'd almost be 40 by the time we got to that point.
7494877	7495538	No, Rob, I would be 40.
7496898	7497418	So shut up.
7497458	7498439	No, I wouldn't be 40, would I?
7498759	7499159	Not yet.
7499459	7499939	Almost.
7502040	7502400	God.
7502800	7504581	Rob, I'm feeling old now, you know.
7504941	7505661	Hey, join the club.
7506665	7508766	Excuse me, Mr. Three years younger than me.
7509226	7509987	Two years younger than me.
7514428	7515489	I know death is coming for me.
7516149	7517970	Oh my god, Sauce had the best suggestion.
7518590	7521071	To do womanizer to Loki's tingalizer.
7524633	7524873	Nice.
7525133	7525393	Very nice.
7525413	7526473	That's an excellent idea.
7528014	7528334	All right.
7529014	7529895	Glad to see you agree.
7529935	7530315	Now do it.
7531175	7532915	This one comes from Dan Shadow.
7559631	7561552	I've already gotten most of the games I'm looking forward to.
7561572	7563232	I guess the only thing I have left is Resistance 2.
7563993	7564933	Resistance 2 is a good one.
7565433	7566854	Mel, do you have anyone you're looking forward to?
7568554	7568994	Anyone else?
7570335	7570975	Left 4 Dead.
7571695	7573036	Yeah, I want zombie action.
7577778	7579618	Speak into the microphone if you're going to make a decision.
7579638	7579878	Which one?
7580018	7580559	Wait, what'd I miss?
7580579	7581199	The Last Remnant.
7581939	7584400	What game are you looking forward to that hasn't come out yet that you don't already have?
7585430	7591914	LittleBigPlanet Fallout 3 I'm also looking forward to Last Remnant though even though I was not a fan of Infinite Undiscovery The beginning was awful I didn't want to play it past the first hour
7614042	7614102	So...
7638194	7643759	Of course we know about the new game coming out, Halo Recon, or Halo 3 Recon.
7644659	7649444	Apparently though, Bungie's Halo team is moving on to other things once this is done.
7651545	7656449	So, I don't know, maybe another game from Bungie that's, say, not Halo?
7657270	7661374	Maybe a, I don't know, a marathon game?
7662174	7662695	Something like that?
7662715	7663215	Malo.
7663816	7664256	Malo.
7665717	7666458	Marathono.
7667987	7669208	Have they said this before?
7669428	7671328	Like, oh, we swear we're not doing another Halo.
7671348	7673809	They said this before, like after Halo 3, but, you know.
7674350	7678691	It says, basically, they were saying that they want to work on different territory.
7679091	7686975	And they said, but I think when this project wraps up in a couple months, that it will be time when the team moves on to something else.
7687255	7693277	And part of the team will move on to something else, and part of them will probably be absorbed into one of the other projects that are already on the way.
7694318	7696398	I like what Deakman suggests in the chat room.
7696438	7697539	A game called J-Lo.
7700492	7700732	Get it?
7702332	7704153	If you have my love.
7705193	7705513	Forget it.
7707014	7709274	Hey, you know how the PlayStation 3 has trophies?
7709494	7710875	Well, according to the U.S.
7710935	7715696	official PlayStation magazine, Sony might actually be giving out more than just trophies pretty soon.
7715756	7718356	It's a little quote from the magazine that people were reading way too much into.
7718396	7723117	It says, quote, We've heard that SCEA is mulling over some sort of trophy reward system.
7723498	7728219	We doubt it'll be cash or the equivalent, but we suspect it might be exclusive access to early betas and the like.
7728679	7728819	So...
7729739	7733282	You know, trophies are like PlayStation 3's version of 360's achievements.
7733642	7738747	Wouldn't that be interesting if suddenly you could use your trophies to now get into betas and stuff?
7739087	7742570	I think Microsoft should do the same thing because I play a lot more Microsoft games.
7743611	7747294	Well, you know, and I agree with the people that wrote this story on the net.
7747815	7752879	I got no problem if it's early demos or what have you, but just to give exclusive?
7753379	7754520	That seems kind of wrong to me.
7755041	7757443	Just encourages people to do nothing but play games all day.
7757503	7770628	but then again this whole thing could be just something retarded similar to what Gears of War is doing you know where for example if you have different achievements in Gears of War that you get shipped for Gears of War 2 could it be something like that?
7771188	7782752	that would make sense I beat LittleBigPlanet when LittleBigPlanet 2 comes out or something like that I get some stupid costume or something that works that works
7783734	7785014	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
7785114	7786715	Maybe more to come from Sony probably in 2009.
7787255	7788695	I doubt that.
7788755	7789776	Sony's going to explode.
7789976	7790296	The end.
7794557	7795617	It already exploded.
7795657	7797618	It puked out something called Star Wars Galaxies.
7798278	7799218	BlackWolf has a good point.
7799258	7800218	I've got to read this in chat.
7800618	7801719	Okay, Sky, what's better?
7801799	7806440	Giving exclusive betas to people who have lots of trophies or giving exclusive betas to people who buy core?
7806780	7807840	I'll take option three.
7808160	7809741	Giving exclusive betas to me.
7809761	7810261	Okay.
7810612	7812154	Here, the cheat has a trophy!
7813335	7813596	Anyway.
7814036	7815578	In other words, the fanboys will never be happy.
7817100	7822986	Well, there is a boy named Brandon Crisp.
7825149	7831773	15 years old who went missing after his parents confiscated his Xbox.
7833294	7842539	Microsoft Canada is adding $25,000 to the reward information that will hopefully lead to his safe return.
7842939	7845281	So they're basically doubling the amount that's already out.
7845361	7849003	They're working with the Barrie, Ontario authorities
7850643	7856825	Looking for IP addresses of anyone who would come into contact with him through Call of Duty 4, which was his favorite game.
7859586	7866688	And Microsoft is really, really putting forward a lot of effort into trying to get this kid back.
7868469	7874411	So basically... Oh God, I hate this person.
7874431	7875591	How is it Microsoft's problem?
7877721	7882625	He who shall not be named has involved himself What the fuck?
7882665	7883706	I thought he was gone.
7884626	7885327	Let me finish.
7886528	7897876	Making an offer to help the cops try to find it and making up some crap about video game addiction or whatever the fuck he's on.
7897896	7897936	Um...
7902150	7903170	I'm so disgusted with him
7923348	7925049	I'm just completely disgusted.
7925209	7926991	I can't even call him a human being anymore.
7927551	7931094	Really, he's just disgusting.
7931174	7931674	He's a fart.
7933235	7941381	At any rate, for anyone who might have some information on his whereabouts, call the Berry Police at 705-725-7025.
7941401	7941481	Okay.
7949843	7951644	I hope that someone can find this kid.
7951664	7954105	I just hope that, you know, he's okay.
7957006	7958987	Stop being an asshole and get out there and look.
7959107	7960508	Someone needs to find him before Jack does.
7961208	7961908	Oh my god.
7962308	7964769	Because if he finds him, we'll never hear the end of it.
7965730	7966030	Wow.
7966730	7968191	Look at all the good I do.
7968611	7969972	I'm just disgusted.
7970372	7972893	I really am horrified, you know.
7974193	7975294	Who does he think he is?
7977630	7984676	I mean, he seriously has caused so much harm to so many people and he can't stop.
7984716	7988319	He's already being punished for it and asshole hasn't learned his lesson yet.
7988839	7995465	I mean, seriously, the only thing that's going to stop this guy is to lock him up in a padded room and have him yell his insults to the wall that does not care.
7997907	7998227	The end.
7999315	8001017	Let's just hope the wall doesn't have a blog.
8001358	8003060	Let's hope the wall fucking bitch slaps him.
8003460	8006224	Okay, I'm a wall, and even I hate you.
8009788	8010189	All right.
8010749	8011190	More news.
8011210	8013292	We're going to open up the Skype line very soon at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8016739	8026146	Legendary Pictures, the company that has done wonderful movies like The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and of course some other stuff.
8026787	8028088	I can only remember the Batman stuff right now.
8028728	8034813	But they are also putting together a non-Batman movie that is going to be Gears of War.
8034853	8041859	Going along with that, Variety is reporting that Legendary Pictures may also be in talks to buy Epic Games.
8043382	8044183	Unreal 3 Town Unreal 3 the RPG
8071004	8074526	Tiger Claw would like to point out that Legendary Pictures also did the upcoming Watchmen movie.
8075026	8075446	It's coming out.
8075526	8075786	It's awesome.
8075806	8076326	Did they also do 300?
8077387	8077607	Yes.
8077767	8078227	I would imagine.
8078748	8079228	There you go.
8080988	8082489	Alright, is this some softcore porn?
8082529	8082709	What?
8082729	8083489	It'll be hot.
8084150	8085010	Alright, woo, porn!
8085550	8091513	Alright, anyway, one more story for you guys tonight and then we're going to open up the Skype line and that story has to do with Street Fighter 4.
8092273	8096715	Street Fighter 4, it's coming out this winter for sure, says Capcom.
8097035	8098216	Now keep in mind, Loki's...
8099116	8100256	You know, next year.
8100917	8102838	Got a real good idea when this game's coming out.
8102978	8109200	Well, the rumors have all been now that, I mean, originally it was supposed to be like January sometime, but now they're trying to time it with the release of the movie.
8109620	8109740	Ah.
8109880	8112822	So, probably around the time that the crappy movie comes out.
8113122	8115563	So, yeah, winter does not mean necessarily this year.
8115663	8117323	Winter is also January and February.
8117383	8119404	Winter, December through February.
8119644	8125267	Now, the movie itself is being released in that time period where all the stinker movies are released, which is like...
8126107	8126807	Thank you for watching!
8146519	8147580	Yeah, agree, the game.
8148180	8148901	By far.
8149201	8149781	Oh, I'm sorry.
8150121	8153424	I'm sure the movie will be a surprise and it'll be this epic, awesome movie.
8154024	8155245	Oh, no, except it won't.
8155745	8155925	Yeah.
8155945	8156406	It'll be crap.
8156566	8157026	I'm in here.
8157186	8157566	I'm with you.
8158507	8160668	All right, let's go to the Skype line.
8160688	8164431	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8164931	8165912	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8165932	8166272	Who's this?
8167693	8168374	It's GS68.
8168494	8169634	Hi, GS68.
8169654	8170075	What's on your mind?
8171412	8177014	I got around to playing the new Castlevania this week, which I'm surprised you didn't mention on last week's release dates.
8178074	8178615	Oh, did you?
8178915	8180335	No, didn't we get mentioned at the end?
8180435	8180775	Yeah, we did.
8181275	8181856	I think we did.
8182696	8185777	The podcast is a little behind, so make sure you have the most current episode.
8186097	8186517	Oh, I don't.
8186937	8188618	Well, I'm not downloading the podcast.
8189458	8190979	Oh, well, I think it got mentioned.
8190999	8193019	But anyway, okay, so I haven't played it yet.
8193059	8193440	I want to.
8193460	8194180	What do you think of the game?
8197721	8200602	It's like the other DS Castlevanias, more or less.
8201206	8206048	Well, I like how they have a lot of new areas now, such as one big area.
8208530	8210250	How does it compare to previous Castlevania games?
8211271	8223377	Well, the maps, for example, they're smaller now, but there's more enemies, so it's more difficult, and you'll usually be so busy fighting enemies that you'll hardly notice that the maps are smaller, especially because...
8224249	8227251	For this game, I hardly use the map.
8227331	8231233	I usually have the second screen for checking enemies and stuff.
8235416	8238297	Do we have any really bad B-movie dialogue in the game?
8240759	8242900	Yeah, the English voice acting kind of sucks.
8243420	8247683	And there's a Japanese language option, but for me it doesn't make it any better.
8247723	8251205	All it does is make it into a language that I'm not very fluent in yet.
8254294	8256395	Alright, well, do you recommend it to fans of Castlevania?
8257555	8259335	Yeah.
8259455	8261156	That doesn't sound like a very solid yes.
8263656	8266097	Kind of like a, yeah, I guess.
8266117	8268857	I mean, if you have nothing better to do, I guess you could do it.
8271158	8278199	If you're looking for a game that's more action-oriented and exploration-oriented, this is a pretty good game to try out.
8280940	8281240	Alright.
8282003	8282463	Sounds good.
8282543	8284204	Anything else you want to talk to our listeners about today?
8287006	8287806	Not much, really.
8288246	8288647	All right.
8288987	8290468	Well, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
8290628	8291468	Enjoy Castlevania.
8291648	8292729	Have fun playing it while I can.
8292949	8293169	See you.
8293189	8293709	All right.
8293729	8293789	Bye.
8293809	8297752	If you'd like to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8297772	8299513	His name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8300193	8301113	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8301133	8301454	Who's this?
8302434	8302974	Hey, hey, hey.
8303055	8303635	It's Ranma.
8303835	8304295	Hey, Ranma.
8304315	8304956	What's on your mind, buddy?
8305656	8306296	Not much.
8306376	8306636	Hi.
8306656	8307377	What's up, everybody?
8308796	8309996	Uh, what's up?
8310657	8312358	What's up?
8313358	8318041	Before I begin, I have here on my table three drinks.
8318782	8320503	One for each of you awesome hosts.
8321063	8321984	Well, thank you very much.
8322344	8323985	Are you going to drink them all right now, live on air?
8324946	8325466	Yes, I am.
8325966	8326366	Awesome.
8327107	8328047	What's drink number one?
8328828	8330689	Drink number one is for Jamie.
8330929	8331550	It's a, uh...
8332498	8334719	It's something straight forward and hard.
8334959	8335699	Straight to the punch.
8336079	8337160	A shot of Jack Daniels.
8337780	8338120	Nice.
8339421	8341561	I hope you're being responsible.
8341762	8342842	There went shot number one.
8342882	8344983	I heard that.
8345023	8345663	Shot number two?
8346523	8348404	Shot number two is for you, Rob.
8348424	8350345	Something nice and fruity.
8351385	8353267	Of course, of course.
8353827	8355229	Orange juice and peach schnapps.
8355969	8356390	Sounds good.
8356410	8358231	That is tasty.
8358271	8358972	Sounds quite gay.
8359112	8359372	All right.
8359733	8359933	Good.
8361494	8362455	We have to make it more hype.
8362675	8365698	All right.
8365798	8367240	And what is shot number three, Pray Tell?
8368341	8369241	I don't know.
8369301	8371323	I asked a friend of mine who came over to make the drink.
8371584	8375207	I call it the Loki because Loki is unstable, so I don't know what's in it.
8376235	8377175	I'm so fucked up right now.
8377235	8378036	I'm so fucked up right now.
8378296	8378876	How's that?
8378916	8379356	Very nice.
8401340	8402481	All right.
8402521	8406264	Well, anything else you wanted to share with us tonight besides drinking live on air?
8407045	8409707	Kicked up Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour.
8409787	8410688	Ooh, at the same time?
8411508	8411689	Yes.
8412149	8412910	And which one's better?
8414751	8416833	The jury is still out, but I will say this much.
8416873	8421597	When it comes to Bon Jovi living on a prayer, Guitar Hero World Tour is a lot better.
8422890	8429102	Here's the thing though, Guitar Hero World Tour actually made Bobby say fuck on his show.
8429543	8431747	So, I mean, that makes me really worried.
8432007	8433791	Like, not even Rock Revolution did that.
8436069	8440171	Well, we're going to get Rock Revolution soon, but we're going to probably wait until a used copy pops up.
8440371	8444513	Did you notice that Rock Revolution has a real basement Metacritic score?
8445433	8446313	It's kind of sad.
8446673	8447974	It was getting like threes.
8448114	8448854	It's crap.
8448894	8450635	Yeah, it's disturbing.
8450675	8454617	I still want to get it because I'm sick, but I'm waiting for it to go on clearance because you know it's just a matter of time.
8455477	8456598	Same here, definitely.
8456838	8457438	Yo, Ranma.
8457598	8458218	We're waiting for clearance.
8458238	8459819	Yo, drink for the guests, dude.
8460919	8461600	We deserve it too.
8486610	8487351	Alright, there you go.
8488091	8489492	Alright, Ranma, we gotta let you go for more calls.
8489592	8491673	Have a good one, buddy.
8491733	8491954	Later.
8494875	8495836	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8495856	8496196	Who's this?
8497277	8498538	Hello there, Orange Lounge.
8498558	8499779	This is Akiriper.
8499979	8501119	Hello, my friend.
8501139	8501460	How are you?
8502682	8503642	I'm doing just fine.
8504662	8505823	Well, what did I call?
8505883	8527108	Well, I was quite surprised that at last the downloadable pack this week for Rock Band, in the sense that it was a few Sushis and Banshees songs, were really like my best news of the week, actually.
8527648	8529589	Yes, I know, I'm very excited about that.
8529930	8533292	It's nice to see a nice eclectic mix of music and rock band.
8534473	8546862	My problem is, though, that of the three songs that are there, only one of them is good, actually.
8547304	8549145	If you actually are to be picky.
8549426	8554810	There's no peekaboo or anything, which would be rad, but I can't imagine actually playing that song in a rock band, that's the thing.
8554930	8567839	Yeah, well, that you're mentioning peekaboo is like, if you know the history behind that song, you know that it will be quite hard in one way, since the whole song is played backwards.
8568460	8569901	Oh, that's right.
8571826	8575529	Since they have to learn how to play it all backwards.
8575549	8577450	That would be a fun challenge mode, though.
8577470	8579131	The notes can scroll the opposite way.
8579151	8582474	That would be fun.
8583835	8585376	What else is going on in your gaming world this week?
8586516	8587397	Not much, actually.
8587557	8589598	Not much at all.
8592640	8595362	It's really a sad thing in one way.
8595763	8599345	I bought Warhammer Online when it came out, and
8599918	8608024	Well, I have played it like... The number of times I have actually played it, I can count it on one hand.
8608224	8608925	Wow, me too.
8609025	8610266	I'm in the exact same boat you are.
8611272	8614393	And then I started thinking in one way, actually.
8615834	8632559	I didn't check out WoW, went back to WoW, actually, but I did see the new logins frequency, the login screen, and that actually made me go,
8633649	8634329	Wee, who?
8634450	8635891	Big Frost Worm.
8636691	8637211	Yeah, it is.
8637291	8638072	It is very pretty.
8638092	8641274	It's like... It's like... Yay, cute!
8641314	8642255	We just got mushroomed.
8642335	8644036	Whoa, we just had a... We just got hit by a flying mushroom.
8644176	8646137	Behave, boys and girls in the studio.
8646197	8647598	Sorry, our guests are getting unruly.
8647618	8648019	Come on.
8649340	8651461	Yeah, well... Mushrooms are funny.
8651741	8652662	Mushroom growing in your head.
8652942	8653222	Alright.
8653883	8654103	Sorry.
8654863	8655924	We're a little distracted here.
8655984	8657525	People are throwing things at each other in the studio.
8659546	8660007	Yes, go ahead.
8661127	8669849	Well, other than that, well, I'm starting to get sort of in one way pissed also, since at the current state, I have no TV whatsoever.
8670550	8671210	Oh my gosh.
8671910	8685694	Yeah, but then again, and that's starting to annoy me, really, since I want to play on my retro, I'm sort of almost really utterly want to play on my PS1, so...
8690290	8693373	since I haven't played on that one for a long time.
8694393	8698297	And, well, I want to play Front Vision 3, damn it!
8700358	8705943	Yeah, you know, you could do that whole thing where you download things to the PSP, but I don't know if they have that game on there.
8706243	8709526	I don't have a PSP yet, that's the thing.
8710086	8718753	And with the thing that the Model 3 has come out, and with the problem that that's causing...
8719953	8723135	I'm sorta like, now, just wait.
8724376	8726817	Really, uh, just wait as usual, so.
8728118	8728298	Alright.
8728878	8735102	Well, hey, Aki Ripper, we gotta, uh, we gotta let you go to get some more calls, but, uh, good luck on the quest for the television.
8735202	8739845	But still, uh, I, I, I, on my short, on short notice, in one way, in one way.
8741047	8745269	I thought of when I was starting to listen to OLR, and it was... That was weird.
8745369	8747890	Skype just crashed on us in the middle of that call.
8748490	8749891	That's why you heard the remix.
8749991	8750731	That was strange.
8751532	8753072	I swear I didn't do anything to provoke that.
8754193	8754713	Okay.
8754733	8758734	Yeah, if somebody else is on the line, I'll go to voicemail right away.
8759835	8760715	So we're going to sign back in.
8760735	8762636	Sorry to Aki Ripper, who got cut off.
8762656	8763616	That was weird.
8764257	8764937	That was very weird.
8765831	8768653	But, um, well, I guess we're open for business again.
8768673	8773535	1-877-GAME-OLR What?
8774336	8774536	What?
8775696	8785842	Rice Princess just sent me a text, and she says, Tell everyone I said hi, and I said my love, and congrats on 300, and also... Alright, that's lovely.
8785862	8786462	Thank you.
8787043	8787343	Alright.
8788043	8788884	Hey, we have another call.
8788944	8790024	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8790044	8790385	Who's this?
8791285	8792426	This is Kitsune.
8792726	8793646	Hi, Kitsune.
8793686	8794407	What's on your mind?
8798439	8799500	Oh, well, thank you very much.
8800360	8802741	Are you calling us from inside your own Sackboy outfit?
8802761	8803801	You sound very distant.
8805161	8807482	No, I'm calling from Japan.
8808683	8809143	Oh, wow.
8809243	8811583	So I guess maybe that might be part of the distance.
8811623	8812904	We chat on AIM sometimes.
8813084	8813684	Oh, right on.
8813844	8814104	Right on.
8814144	8817325	Well, what's been going on in your gaming world this week?
8818706	8822787	Well, the other week I went to Tokyo Game Show, which was really exciting.
8823087	8824067	Tell us about that.
8824107	8824988	How was Tokyo Game Show?
8825008	8825968	What kind of stuff did you see there?
8827242	8829484	Oh, it was huge and very exciting.
8829544	8830525	Tons of people.
8831246	8833608	The biggest booth is probably Xbox 360.
8834689	8837032	Do you think Xbox 360 is going to turn around in Japan?
8838353	8839194	I believe so.
8839414	8844599	I mean, they had a pretty big booth and tons of people waiting in line.
8844619	8847001	They had a 105 minute wait for one game.
8847422	8848583	Wow, what game was that?
8850425	8851546	I think it was...
8854500	8856061	I'm kind of not surprised at that, yeah?
8856221	8860625	Because that would be the game that is supposed to cater to the Japanese audience.
8860725	8861246	Wow.
8862267	8864449	That's why E3 can't go public, you guys.
8864469	8867431	105 minute waits just to play one RPG?
8867672	8870474	Imagine what those Wii lines would have looked like if it was open to the public.
8870494	8871475	It would have been nutso.
8872076	8872296	Anyway.
8873897	8874398	Wow.
8875279	8876640	I'm glad you're having a good time.
8877878	8880939	This is a DS game I want to talk about called Time Hollow.
8881439	8881679	Okay.
8881839	8886941	And it is a Japanese game, but it was just released in the States, and it is amazing.
8887021	8897265	If you ever heard of Shadow of Destiny for the PlayStation 1, it's much like that game in which you have to change the past, and then it causes something else to change, but you've got to go back and change again.
8897945	8903388	And it has real anime videos throughout the whole game, and I loved it.
8903948	8906909	So it sounds kind of like a puzzle game, but with anime cutscenes?
8908833	8909834	Not a puzzle game.
8910934	8911974	It's an adventure game.
8913675	8914135	Interesting.
8914255	8917536	Oh, Meltdown's calling it Butterfly Effect the game.
8918657	8919837	Yes, yes.
8919897	8920217	Okay.
8920577	8921558	That's kind of cool.
8922698	8923058	Okay.
8923078	8924278	I might have to check that out.
8924579	8931341	You know, there's a lot of these games that really don't show up on the radar like that that I wish would get more coverage so I know to look out for them.
8933595	8935956	Thank you very much and I'll check out Time Hollow for sure.
8935976	8936436	You take care.
8936456	8936516	Bye.
8936576	8936736	Bye bye.
8960203	8962564	I like getting phone calls from far, far, far away.
8962945	8963225	All right.
8964465	8967707	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8967767	8968988	Username on Skype is Orange Launch Radio.
8969608	8970589	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8970609	8970929	Who's this?
8973410	8976292	Oh, it's a random bitch that finally got her 360 this week.
8976532	8977112	Wait, who's this?
8979253	8979734	Misty.
8979954	8980634	Hey, Misty.
8980674	8983095	Wait, Misty, did you say you finally actually got a 360 this week?
8986109	8987470	Yeah, finally.
8987490	8990951	Oh yeah, I migrated my account since the day I got the system.
9007796	9008697	You have to send me a message.
9010358	9014000	It's the same gamertag from last time, my LJ name, so you're already on my list.
9015101	9016722	Oh, okay, that's right, that's right, that's right.
9016762	9018544	Okay, I forgot you had the old Xbox.
9018624	9020285	It's just that I hardly ever saw you on there.
9020385	9021606	Okay, well, cool.
9021926	9023768	Well, what games did you get for 360?
9023808	9023848	Uh...
9027777	9029919	Main one was Portal's Still Alive.
9030480	9033242	I caved and downloaded Beat and Groovy for the fuck of it.
9033262	9034343	It's really not worth it.
9034483	9034863	I know, I know.
9034883	9036705	I have not downloaded Beat and Groovy.
9049176	9051939	It does have a couple good songs in it, but the price tag sucks.
9052119	9053821	It only has a couple songs in it.
9053841	9054062	It does.
9069125	9076491	I admit I haven't been paying attention much I've been too busy with the stuff I have got Well you need to pay more attention to our show young lady No I'm just kidding it's cool
9098180	9106645	it's all good come on you have a shitty attention span I know so any chance of a Misty visit in the future?
9109707	9126318	I'm working on it I wasn't feeling good before that dentist appointment I had the other day so I had to postpone it a pay period so yeah I still want to I just don't know when at least there's always Xbox Live to connect us in the meantime alright Misty any other quick thoughts before we let you go?
9129353	9129874	Not really.
9130254	9130554	All right.
9130574	9131335	Well, have a good one, Missy.
9131375	9131755	Enjoy the new 360.
9131795	9134917	Thanks.
9135198	9135598	Bye.
9137239	9139921	We'll do one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
9139941	9142523	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9142603	9144064	Use name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9144484	9145485	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9145505	9145885	Who's this?
9146846	9147607	Hey, this is Bobby.
9147647	9149268	I'm from a far off place called Atlanta.
9149617	9163121	Hi, Far Off Place I don't know if I've ever heard of Atlanta No, hey Bobby, I'm glad you called in Worst airport ever We're always calling into your show in a way No, no, no Philadelphia is the worst airport Really?
9164322	9169263	Dallas Dallas is cakewalk Y'all have never been to Philly Compared to Atlanta's airport?
9169283	9177926	Philly, Chicago Bobby, you always let us call into your show but you're never on ours What's on your mind, Bobby?
9179039	9182901	Well, no, I was just calling in to congratulate you on 300.
9182941	9185002	Kind of a question for you guys about your show.
9185623	9188524	Where do you see yourself at episode 400?
9189545	9190025	Canceled.
9191906	9192747	Somebody had to say it.
9193527	9194988	Where do we see ourselves at episode 400?
9196008	9196609	Good question.
9196769	9198130	I'll let Loki start.
9200987	9202308	and DarkSakura.com.
9219645	9220345	systems.
9221126	9224427	I think honestly in two years it'll be kind of about the next round of systems.
9224947	9230009	I think we'll try to do our best to maintain to stay on the cutting edge of interactive tools.
9230609	9234250	I think you will see Orange Launch Radio getting into video more in two years.
9234770	9236091	Not necessarily that we're going to be.
9236111	9237131	The hell we will.
9237631	9238832	Not in the way you think.
9239212	9241432	Not necessarily it'll be our mugs reading the news.
9241512	9244093	It'll be furries!
9244613	9244974	Shut up.
9245474	9248775	Maybe the way folks interact with us I think will be different.
9250530	9269653	I just you know because you know we were one of the first shows to really jump on Skype when that first came out and you know Justin TV we weren't really the first but you know that was a way to kind of expand through that and you know we like to try to stay on the cutting edge of how to stay interactive with the listeners so you know it's it's hard to think of what hasn't been done yet I don't know
9272312	9275033	Does that Sackboy costume have fur on it?
9275794	9277074	Does that count as a furry for you?
9277194	9277934	No, it's not.
9278395	9278715	I don't know.
9279095	9279755	It's stuff.
9279975	9281596	It's like sweatshirt material.
9281676	9283536	It's like a giant sweatshirt is what it is.
9283836	9284737	It's not furry though.
9286277	9287338	And no Tingle hat on it?
9287938	9289098	No Tingle hat this time.
9289218	9293180	But we figured this is the closest the listeners are ever going to get to seeing Loki in a Tingle outfit.
9293240	9296461	So you got to take what you can.
9297168	9305293	No, because from what I can understand, Loki likes Sackboy, so it's not as fun to see him dressed up as that as it would be to see him dressed up as Tingle.
9305413	9306813	But it's still adorable!
9307234	9308034	Well, I can't help it.
9308094	9311656	Someone hasn't sold another 800,000 copies of something, you know?
9311916	9312877	We're working on it!
9313217	9314818	Let's write friends forever.
9314858	9316479	We're putting billboards up for it.
9318440	9319100	I'm sorry.
9319120	9324583	I have a PlayStation 3 now, so I can add Loki to my friends list, so you don't have to be Loki's only friend anymore, Bobby.
9324643	9325784	I have more than one friend now.
9326596	9327076	I'll have you know.
9327116	9328777	Yeah, he dumped me as his only friend.
9329298	9332500	There were some other people that actually had LittleBigPlanet already that were playing it.
9332580	9334481	Not that I could play at them because the servers aren't up yet.
9334801	9335261	Till tomorrow.
9335501	9336322	They're going to be up tomorrow.
9336462	9336922	Fuck yeah.
9339084	9339564	Can't wait.
9339924	9347849	So, hey, Bobby, now that you're on the R-rated show, is there anything you want to say about Guitar Hero World Tour you didn't get to say on your show?
9349861	9355263	Well, I see, when you added that I didn't get to say on my show, that kind of cut it out.
9356204	9370429	Yeah, the drums fucking suck, and maybe next time Activision really should kind of look at their own equipment before they badmouth the other ones and say, hey, when theirs breaks, you can come by ours, because it won't break.
9371370	9372430	Yeah.
9372610	9374691	It won't break, because it's already broken.
9374871	9378833	Have you thought about checking out Rock Revolution's drum set, just to see if it's better?
9380827	9382430	Well, I don't think it's out yet, actually.
9382871	9384214	Oh my gosh, even though the game's out?
9384615	9390608	The game is out, but the drum set's not out until November because apparently they haven't quite figured out the manufacturing of that either.
9392844	9400049	I mean, I've played on the drum kit a couple times, but no, the actual drum set's not in stores yet.
9400089	9400789	It's just the game.
9401129	9409154	What I want to know is, the drums weren't, I mean, I don't think I didn't get to play it, but it didn't seem that the drums were broken when they were showing it off.
9409474	9410015	What happened?
9410075	9410875	I mean, seriously.
9411796	9412416	Mass production.
9412816	9413457	I guess, yeah.
9414264	9422493	I remember when Rock Band was first shown at the PAX that you guys weren't at the year before, they started out with like three...
9437327	9440730	and they had one by the end of the weekend.
9441170	9445713	And you could actually see the other drum sets all bandaged up in the corner of the booth.
9445773	9446433	It was kind of sad.
9446813	9448374	The sad, depressed, broken machines.
9449275	9462963	And I had Dan Teasdale on... I was doing an interview with him for my show from the booth and I asked him about the durability of the drum sets and while I was asking the question, I looked at the pile of depressed drum sets and he didn't take the bait.
9463863	9467384	I have not seen a single post from anybody that says, my drums work perfectly.
9493561	9502104	That's not to say that there's none that aren't effective, but either they're too busy playing the game or they just don't post on forums or whatever.
9502684	9505425	Everybody has some sort of problem with the drums.
9507346	9507646	Wow.
9508326	9515569	Well, I guess it's a good thing I don't buy these games for the drum parts because I'm just not good at drums, so I always buy them for guitars.
9515649	9518790	But still, if I ever was interested in doing it someday, that's kind of depressing.
9519310	9519630	I don't know.
9520959	9527420	Yeah, and I mean, I guess now I've got to do the whole RMA process, but I'm kind of worried, you know, have they fixed it yet?
9527440	9536822	Because some of these threads, you know, I've looked on the official Guitar Hero forums, which I know are mostly negative because the people only post there when they're pissed or can't play.
9537783	9541683	But they've said, you know, one guy said, I've returned it three times.
9541823	9543344	My store has no more.
9543804	9547885	Every single drum set that I've gotten from the store has a different pad that's broken.
9548265	9548685	Dang.

9579459	9586042	So they kind of insinuate that it's Harmonix's fault that you're trying to play Guitar Hero in a specific way.
9587122	9588483	In a way that works?
9589443	9590044	Huh.
9590064	9595886	Because it's weird because ordinary drums, they just seem to make noise whenever I hit them.
9597505	9608855	You know, Bobby, and it's kind of funny coming from you because I know you're essentially a professional drummer and, you know, it's just kind of funny that, gee, a professional drummer isn't playing the drums right, apparently.
9610171	9613974	Yeah, and you have to smack it really hard for it to register.
9614014	9617956	And they say, well, you may need to hit a pad harder or you may need to hit them softer.
9618157	9620618	And I'm like, not in that sense.
9620698	9626663	You shouldn't have to hit the right pad three times as hard as the middle pad and stuff.
9626703	9631566	And I mean, I even plugged in my professional drum kit, which I've been passing around photos.
9632146	9633387	Oh, man, that photo is hilarious.
9633407	9633507	Yeah.
9635135	9640161	You have to post that photo in chat because it's hilarious seeing all your equipment practically on top of each other.
9640522	9643725	I want to ask you though real quick, what about the guitar with the game?
9643745	9647790	Because for those of us that aren't so much into drums or guitars, have you played around with that at all?
9648411	9653357	I play around a little bit with the guitar and I am happy to report that my guitar looks like it has absolutely no problem.
9655333	9680739	now that being said I don't really understand the point of that slider thing the tutorial shows you how to use it and it doesn't work all the time but I think it's because I'm doing it wrong not because the hardware sucks but it's kind of like the lower fret notes in Rock Band I'll never use it there's things that you can do with it now one of the things is that is your wah-wah
9681619	9709564	so instead of using the whammy bar for things that maybe you don't have star power you can actually run your hand along that and it does the wah-wah thing which is kind of cool and I did that a couple times just for the novelty factor but the guitar feels fine and they actually did add one of the actual software things for people that didn't buy the guitar that they added to World Tour is that now you can have one note held down and then you can strum down a second note
9710205	9710845	and a third note.
9710865	9712706	So they'll do chords that kind of come on like that.
9712746	9717468	They're not hammer-ons, but you still have to keep one note held down while you bring the second one in.
9717908	9718528	Interesting.
9718608	9718808	Huh.
9719568	9723990	Well, I'm still using a Guitar Hero 2 Explorer in all my games.
9724170	9725291	That's the only controller I have.
9725631	9727591	So it's time for me to get a new one.
9727651	9728472	So it'll be interesting.
9730712	9733333	Other than that, people are asking, how's the actual game?
9733473	9738514	I've been spending most of the day trying to get the game to work, so I haven't really gotten too far in the game.
9738775	9748077	Although I will say that apparently the storyline behind the game, according to the intro screen, is Kenny G comes out and hypnotizes everybody, and it's your job to unhypnotize everybody.
9749119	9751961	Wow, that's such a Guitar Hero story.
9752181	9753762	I hope that's fake.
9754583	9757045	Oh, that's the opening cinematic.
9757145	9767852	A guy with a clarinet comes out and hypnotizes the entire crowd, and so the GH symbol flashes on everybody's cell phone and watch and stuff, and they all converge to unhypnotize the crowd.
9767912	9772255	Well, aren't they going to feel stupid when they release Clarinet Hero later on?
9774237	9777259	All right, Bobby, we've got to let you go so we can wrap our show.
9777299	9778460	Do you have any last thoughts?
9780839	9784684	Fuck you people who brag about your hardware that doesn't work.
9785264	9785645	All right.
9786266	9787047	Take care, Bobby.
9787447	9788148	Thanks, guys.
9788288	9790351	We wouldn't have gotten here without you, Bobby.
9790631	9791412	So thank you.
9791873	9792193	Take care.
9792393	9793935	I'll make you late in two weeks.
9794436	9794997	All right.
9795337	9795618	Bye.
9797443	9798484	DarkSakura, anything?
9798504	9798564	No?
9798584	9798784	Loki then?
9821232	9825834	Just real quick, there was a little big planet download that was added in for Japan.
9826114	9828135	You know that game Ape Escape?
9828815	9835638	Well, now you can download a costume for your Sackboy that's actually the ape in the game, which is kind of funny.
9836399	9840140	Also, Army of Two is supposed to be getting a movie as well.
9840160	9840761	You know what's funny?
9840801	9845062	We hear a lot of these movies that are coming out, but none of them come out except for Max Payne.
9846183	9847183	I guess they're all next year?
9847323	9849184	It's all talk until it actually happens.
9850345	9850685	Alright.
9851707	9854149	So that's it, I guess, for last-minute stories.
9854189	9859313	All right, one other quick little dedication here Drew Nami wants to do, and then we're going to go around and get final thoughts tonight.
9859533	9860935	A little bit of sad news.
9861635	9865598	For the WoW players that remember the forums, remember Ezra Chatterton.
9866699	9879550	He was contacted by the Make-A-Wish Foundation because he had a brain tumor and talked to Blizzard and had some things customized for him, had a few weapons dedicated to him, had an entire...
9881138	9889666	and the entire few characters and questlines in his honor passed away on Monday, October 20th, from a stroke.
9891949	9894111	And our thoughts are with them.
9894926	9896747	Well, that's very unfortunate.
9897007	9906633	And, you know, I know there was a lot of people that actually went in and did the Will You Find My Dog quest that day, just kind of like to... Because that was his quest, and his voice is still in the game.
9906933	9915098	So it's very interesting that, you know, despite what's happened offline, he kind of will continue to live on online, which is really neat.
9915418	9916319	Which is a nice dedication.
9916339	9917900	Something only a video game could do.
9919241	9921502	I know that is a very sad note to end Episode 300 with, so...
9923423	9925986	Can somebody make a fart joke or something to bring us back?
9926026	9926306	Rob.
9926566	9926846	What?
9927087	9927487	Dongle.
9928708	9929849	I'm Ross Princess.
9930690	9931390	All right, thank you.
9932331	9932691	I appreciate it.
9932912	9934353	Well, hey, we still have the final thoughts.
9935094	9936615	And here, wait, here.
9936935	9940839	This always makes everything better, guys, if you're feeling a little down here.
9941940	9942961	I know how to make everything better.
9944882	9945263	Wait, hold on.
9947565	9948666	This always makes everything better.
9951603	9952205	Thanks for watching!
9957318	9958099	Yay, yes, it's good to be back.
9982279	9984440	Now that you know where the studio is, feel free to come back sometime.
9984580	9984981	Sure.
9986482	9991365	Just make sure there's a show first, because I've had that happen where we cancel the show for a night and someone showed up anyway.
9993286	9993666	Poor guy.
9994647	9996608	The Doctor, do you have anything you want to say?
9997128	9998949	Glub, glub, glub, glub.
10000610	10002572	Hiccup Boy, any final thoughts?
10003572	10004893	It's a coral reef.
10005854	10006334	Crikey.
10008649	10011412	Drew Nami, anything you want to leave the listeners with tonight?
10011753	10012654	You got some red on you.
10015157	10016358	Loki, final thought.
10019221	10022545	I'm going to win my costume contest at work, I think.
10024988	10025329	Good luck.
10026455	10035243	My final thought is, since we're not doing another show before Election Day, please, please, please vote.
10035984	10039567	And please, please, please, if you're in California, vote no on Prop 8.
10040027	10043290	And if you do, you'll never have to hear me talk about it again.
10043671	10045612	And I also believe you should vote no on 4.
10045893	10048315	Hell, I'd give you my entire political opinions.
10048835	10051037	It's the one about parental notification.
10051218	10051538	Oh, yeah.
10052278	10053760	Vote yes for the monorail.
10053880	10057763	I voted no on damn near everything except the monorail.
10059524	10066689	Honestly, even the presidential election pales in comparison to what rights are in store with Prop 8, but that, obviously, I'm a little biased.
10066910	10067990	You can probably understand why.
10068971	10071113	Anyhow, DarkSakura, your final thought.
10071493	10072434	Reject false icons.
10073399	10073819	Well said.
10074580	10074860	All right.
10075401	10077543	We won't be here next week, but we'll be back in two weeks.
10077663	10080545	Wherever you guys are on Wednesday, please send some happy thoughts my way.
10080585	10081085	I'm going to need them.
10081626	10083968	And send a dollar to DarkSakura because she wants them.
10084428	10089432	And send some copies of Eye of Judgment to Loki because maybe you'll get an even better costume for episode 400.
10089492	10091014	You never know unless you try.
10091935	10093196	We'll do this all again next week.
10093236	10095838	If you like what you heard, please tell two friends about our show.
10096138	10098000	Word of mouth is how we spread the word about our program.
10099915	10101096	But for now, that's going to do it.
10101576	10103037	Leave us a nice review on iTunes or something.
10104077	10104558	We're out of here.
10104858	10106338	See you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
10106459	10107259	We'll be back in two weeks.
10124108	10126612	or allgames.com but we're probably right anyway see you next week
