357200	361840	it's just another show nothing special lots of gaming news to talk about tonight but we have to
361840	366160	start it off as we always do with a little bit of how is your gaming week dark soccer how was
366160	373360	your gaming week um it was a big fable i didn't do much playing in it however dan did and he's
373360	378080	been throwing fire at people and showing off his trophy which i think is entirely and flipping
378080	385120	everyone off which is just the best ever and his guy looks kind of like a gorilla um with a red
385120	390160	coat and it's kind of cool and i've decided that when i play fable um play fable 2 i'm going to
390160	397600	make the biggest raging lesbian ever you're still a chicken chaser you chase chickens i'm okay and
398480	402720	but he had to do the thing where he had to wear dreads and mutton chops and the dress and they
402720	407760	said it was the wrong dress and that was kind of funny and i've been playing ragnarok of course
408720	415440	and um i got my ds finally however it's not here it's at home but dan got me a black ds
416640	422640	much very similar to melton's black ds you have a blue one that melton has like a little star
422640	428320	wars thing on it's pretty neat little uh i could i could totally bust out my uh miyamoto stickers
428320	436800	though from e3 a few years ago but um but yes i have a nice one i babysat yesterday too really
436800	442560	yes did you play any games with the baby we went to the jungle gym and played let's splash
442560	448320	all of the water in the fountain and um baby's gonna slide down whether you're at the bottom
448320	458160	to catch him or not and let's see how many times catch the baby and it was also let's let's see
458160	463600	how often julian will run back to the swings and beg to be in it only to not do anything but look
463600	468240	at the other children i think the orange lounge radio official game should be something a lot like
468240	472320	wario wear where all the little micro games are like little in-jokes from the show and there
472320	477760	should be one where dark sakura is there with a big net and it says catch and baby stars and
477760	484720	there's babies falling from the sky i do have to say i do have to say and this he's such a
484720	490000	good kid that he's the reason why i'm no longer afraid of most babies in small numbers namely one
490000	497680	do you want to eat them like shane no shane has um subscriptions we we heart you shane you've
497680	501520	got subscriptions he's not listening he hates this show all right well he hates everything
501520	509600	that he likes anything else high school musical oh lord my god all right uh you're cut off all
509600	515200	right no no loki sack boy sack loki how was your gaming week um i didn't play that much this week
515200	524080	mainly i played um little big planet i love that game um it's actually i'm now in the japanese
524080	528640	level which is pretty cool so i'm dressed up like a ninja and i've got uh i'm a ninja pirate because
528640	535440	i'm wearing the ninja the ninja uh and i've got the uh pirate outfit and um i'm carrying a frying
535440	541360	pan so that's awesome and how is everyone's a little bit racist the game um pretty good but it
541360	548480	apparently uh it's not going to be as racist soon so um no i mean come on it was we were looking at
548480	552320	it on justin tv last week after the show it's like a little present for our live listeners and we
552320	558320	saw like a bunch of like you know that the africa level is all the africa stereotypes and you know
558320	563360	the south america level is all those stereotypes you know and the america level was hot dogs and
563360	569120	cheeseburgers just i know actually it was it was race cars and jazz there you go wait wait wait
569120	576080	if you go to maticas car will they shut down everything i don't know um now i'm glad though
576080	581520	when they did fix the song um that they didn't actually remove it from the game they just edited
581520	585840	out the lyrics which is awesome because the song itself was awesome and to be honest if the lyrics
585840	590800	aren't in there i'm not sad so all right whatever but um other than that i've been playing saints
590800	596240	row 2 multiplayer because that's fun still glitchy in fact we found a new trick now apparently if you
596240	600080	throw satchel charges on people because you can actually stick them to other players if i like
600080	604480	for example stick multiple satchel charges on when they respawn they still have the ones that haven't
604480	609680	exploded yet so you can detonate them again and kill them again which is uh kind of a boo-boo
609680	615760	there but um and then oddly enough i've been watching someone play fable can you guess who
615760	623120	is playing fable 2 my wife is playing fable 2 wait your wife the game hater is playing fable 2
623120	627280	yes she's playing fable 2 she here's how it happened she saw the commercial fort that they
627280	632320	have now where the guy is playing with the little uh i forget what you call those things um and
632320	637440	balls no not balls the little thing the fortune things that you open in your hand it looked like
637440	642160	a little pac-man i don't remember they call those kids in elementary school play with them anyways
642160	647200	so and each time he changes it it's a fortune kudi catcher thank you kudie catcher okay
647200	650880	so he's playing with that and each time he changes it it changes his appearance and
650880	654160	kind of looks evil and stuff like that and ellie's like what game is that that looks
654160	658640	cool because she's really into the whole people becoming evil thing you know like darth vader
658640	662880	she loved the whole like story of darth vader aren't you a little worried that your wife likes
662880	668080	it when people become evil i don't know but anyways so she's like what game is that i'm
668080	671520	I'm like, oh, Fable 2. I'm like, I've had that for a while now. Do you want to play it? She's like,
672800	677040	she's all, yeah, set it up for me. So I set it up for her, kind of helped her walk through it. Now
677040	680400	she's way further in the game than I am. But granted, I've only played the game for like less
680400	685520	than an hour, so, you know. But she, she was like literally when I was leaving today to go finish my
685520	690560	costume before I came over here. She was just like, she's okay, I gotta quit in like half an
690560	694640	hour because I have to go to the gym. And she's just seriously contemplating not going to the
694640	701600	gym to play the game. Nice. Yeah. Wow. Just getting to that point. Yeah. I know it brings
701600	707520	back memories of Final Fantasy XI. I know, a proud gamer moment. Are you a proud gaming husband now?
708880	712160	I, I don't think she's gonna, she's gonna get bored with it because she's not paying attention
712160	715840	to any of the storyline or any of like what's supposed to go on. She's like, kill, kill, die,
715840	719520	die, die, kill, kill, die, die, die. It keeps giving her like helpful hints like, you know,
719520	722800	her life is low, you should go find an inn or some potion. She's like, I don't know where the
722800	727200	hell the inn is. I'm like, go to one of the towns. She's like, I went to the towns, there's no inns
727200	732160	there. I'm like, you need to look around to see if you can find it. Well, I don't know how to do
732160	736240	that. Or like she still doesn't have, she hasn't quite figured out the right analog stick so she
736240	740080	can't change the camera angle very well. Look for the building that says inn on it. I know,
740080	743600	but she doesn't have patience for that stuff. I'm like, well, she's like, what am I supposed
743600	746240	to be doing now? I'm like, well, what'd that guy say to you? I don't know, I wasn't listening to
746240	751520	him. Stuff like that. Let's read some comments from chat. Chat.orangelawnsradio.com. By the way,
751520	755200	I know we have a lot of people on Justin TV tonight because of a Loki being sack boy. I
755200	760320	don't know what it is. If Justin TV highlighted us or something, but please keep in mind, we only
760320	764320	read our regular chat room at chat.orangelawnsradio.com. That's not because we hate you
764320	768800	guys, Justin TV, but it's because, well, it's partially that, but no, we have a real hard time
768800	773040	reading two chat rooms at once. Cause we are trying to do a show here. So chat.orangelawnsradio.com.
773040	778480	Redertainment in chat says the last time I skipped the gym to game was five years ago. I haven't been
778480	785920	back to the gym since. There you go. All right. Anyhow, I'm assuming that's it for Loki's gaming
785920	792400	week. So I'll talk about my gaming week. Um, I finally bought a PlayStation three after all.
792400	798800	Why are you booing? At least there's good games on it. At least you didn't buy it just because,
798800	805120	Oh, I want a PlayStation 3. Now there were finally games I wanted out. I want little big planet,
805120	809040	even though I wasn't able to get it yesterday, contrary to popular rumor, but I have it all set
809040	813120	up. I have a Blu-ray disc. At least I have Edward Scissorhands on Blu-ray cause that movie is
813120	816560	awesome. You have to get an Amber before Christmas too. It looks good on Blu-ray. And I like to
816560	821040	mention though that last week I was concerned that I may have to return my copy a little bit.
821040	825600	It's my turn. Sorry. So I didn't have to thank God. So I get to keep the slightly offensive
825600	829920	version. Awesome. All right. So yeah, I finally got, took the plunge and got a PlayStation three
829920	835280	for SingStar ABBA as well, even though that's not out till December, but I did buy SingStar
835280	840000	PlayStation three and a, you know, the game itself is kind of crappy compared to like Rob
840000	843840	Band and other songs that you can sing it. But I will tell you the best thing about SingStar
843840	847360	PlayStation three. Actually, there's a couple of good things about it. It's, it's a really good
847360	852000	party game because it has the music videos in the back. It's a, it's a good game for non-gamers.
852000	854880	If that makes sense. Like it's a good game for people to just pick up the mics and sing and have
854880	858800	fun with it. And there are a lot of songs on the SingStar, even though I haven't heard of half of
858800	863120	them. There's like 300 songs on that store, but I'll tell you the best part is that part. That's
863120	867520	like YouTube that you can go in there and look at the community videos. Um, I don't have a webcam
867520	871280	myself. Thank you very much. I don't want to put myself on there now. Don't worry about it, but
872080	876800	you can go look at other people and there are some awesome videos on there. Like they have people
876800	881440	dressed up in star Wars costumes, dancing to some of the songs, but I'll tell you that the cutest
881440	886560	ones are people that have their kids singing the song. Like there's this little three-year-old girl
886560	895920	singing a blink 182 dammit. And she's so cute doing it. She's like, she's so cute. And so
895920	899840	that's the best part of the game is just going on like the YouTube type thing and looking at that.
899840	904720	So I had fun with it. So, um, yeah, I don't know that it's not for everyone. Get it. If you have
904720	908480	a lot of parties, but if you're a solo gamer, I don't think there's a lot here for you unless
908480	912160	you like to sing to yourself. Um, otherwise I'm just holding out for a little big planet
912160	916480	and I'll probably be going back to the three 60 in the meantime. However, I will say this, uh,
916480	922240	PlayStation three has, I got to say that Blu-ray player is pretty awesome. Um, and it does upscale
922240	926880	the old movies pretty good on DVD and the media server I thought was a lot easier to use the
926880	932080	Microsoft's servers. I was really surprised that kind of surprised me. I was thinking that the
932080	936320	three 60 media server would be a lot easier cause you know, hello windows, you know, Microsoft,
936320	942640	no, the PlayStation three one was disgustingly simple. However, here's a word of advice for you
942640	946720	folks. Don't run the media server and your internet connection at the same time. Cause
946720	950400	it can't, your internet connection can't hold it on the PlayStation three. That's the one thing
950400	954800	about it. So there you go. That was pretty much my gaming week. Otherwise I haven't played a whole
954800	959760	lot. Um, Aurora faint on the iPhone, which is pretty awesome for a free game. That game is
959760	964480	all kinds of awesome. Huh? I had another game. What's that? I downloaded pull position remix.
964480	968560	How'd you like that? Um, it's actually surprisingly easy to play, but I still suck at
968560	975760	pole position. So, but the crashes and everything are fantastic. I suck the pole position. Uh,
975760	980400	black Wolf in chat room says, uh, Rob, like confirmed Rob likes parents exploiting children
980400	989680	on the internet. Uh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's cute. All right. If you don't do this,
989680	995520	you don't get to eat. Um, and Ross to UT says, Rob, I have media server and internet running
995520	999680	at the same time. No problem. Well, that's you. Congrats to you. All right. It didn't
999680	1005520	work right for me. I know my special, but now I have all the next gen systems. So there you have
1005520	1010720	it. I did get, you know, if you got pole position on the phone, I will say I got Pac-Man on the
1010720	1015520	iPhone, which is kind of neat. Cause you can do motion. You can tilt it. Yeah. It's kind of dumb.
1015520	1018800	Like you play it once and then it's over. So just get the free trial. Don't pay for it.
1018800	1023440	But, but the pole position one though, honestly, it really is playable. And on top of that,
1023440	1028560	not only can you have it use motion, uh, use, uh, your tilt to turn left to right. You can choose
1028560	1035200	to have your accelerator or your brake on screen. Um, or you can actually have a steering wheel on
1035200	1042320	screen to steer with, or you can use a slider. So that's kind of cool. Um, looking in chat and I'm,
1042320	1047280	I lied. I looked at Justin TV chat for a minute. Um, and the, a person by the name of Sony PS3
1047280	1051360	sucks. So I'm sure it's just thrilled to hear my news this week says that jelly car is on iPhone
1051360	1054800	for free. I forgot about that. I read about that somewhere. And that was actually a really awesome
1054800	1058960	game on the XNA service. Um, the little beta thing they had there. So I really want to check
1058960	1065840	that out on iPhone. So there you go. All right. Anyhow, uh, real quickly, uh, going around and
1065840	1069520	seeing what other kinds of games, uh, people have been playing this week. Uh, Mel Chan,
1069520	1075600	what's one game you've been playing this week? Sadly, my Japanese coach, your Japanese coach.
1075600	1080160	Well, how, how exactly does it teach you Japanese? Uh, it's actually pretty neat. It's got an
1080160	1084400	interface that you can trace the writing so you can really learn your brush strokes and stuff.
1084400	1088880	It's got a bunch of fun little games to play that actually really have been helping my memory and
1088880	1093360	helping me remember the shit that I learned a few years ago when I actually did take Japanese class.
1094240	1098080	Would you say that it's something that somebody could pick up and learn Japanese with,
1098080	1103280	or is it better a supplement to an actual Japanese class as a supplement to an actual Japanese class?
1103280	1108000	But it is nice because it does have a dictionary and a phrase guide thing built into it. So if you
1108000	1111200	are somewhere, you need to say something that you don't exactly know how to say. You can look
1111200	1114320	up real quick and be like, this is what I need to say. This is how I have to say it.
1114320	1117120	Awesome. Um, Drew, what's one thing you've been playing this week?
1118240	1124080	World of Warcraft, the burning crew. Brains. We have a story coming on that later,
1124080	1126400	but how, how's Wobbling? Are you excited about Lich King?
1126400	1131600	Oh, very excited. I've been, uh, leveling with, uh, Camara lately. Uh, thanks to that
1131600	1135360	recruit a friend thing, triple experience. She and I are going through Outlands as mage and warlock
1135360	1139600	63. So far it's, it's a blast. What are you most looking forward to about Lich King?
1139600	1145840	Uh, death knights, that and motorcycles. Awesome. Uh, the doctor who, by the way,
1145840	1148720	brought us some mushrooms for the studio. I don't know if you can see them on Justin TV.
1148720	1154080	Can you hold one up for the Justin TV folks? Uh, what the mushrooms look like here. There you go.
1154080	1158000	Look at that. And, uh, those are awesome. Where did you make those just for this? Or did you
1158000	1162640	steal those from your work? Last year, my work, we did Mario as a theme for Halloween. So, uh,
1162640	1165520	one of my coworkers made them. Awesome. Well, thank you for stealing them and bringing them
1165520	1168240	here. Um, what's one game you've been playing this week, doctor?
1168880	1172560	Actually, Hiccup Boy has gotten me back into DDR, which, oh my God, that's like the best
1172560	1177440	exercise ever. You've lost some weight too. Well, maybe like, yeah, just today. Oh my God,
1177440	1181280	because my hand's all sweaty from DDR. What kind of DDR? What?
1181280	1185120	Um, like it's old school DDR. It's like, like extreme DDR from like the arcade.
1185120	1190800	So, but I love it. Like it's good. It's good times. It is. It's very good exercise. And I,
1190800	1194480	I like though the here on our 300th episode, somebody brings up DDR. So thank you. Oh my God.
1194480	1198160	No. And that's, I don't think a boy like you are the one of the DDR Kings. So there you go.
1198160	1201520	There you go. Uh, Arcadian. What, what's one game you've been playing this week? I picked up,
1201520	1206640	uh, Sonic Chronicles yesterday and play that a bit. Nice. It's actually pretty good. What system?
1206640	1210640	So it's a DS DS. And that's like, what is all the old school, old school Sonic games?
1210640	1216960	No, no, it's a new RPG. Oh, I thought it was actually called Sonic RPG. Okay. How is it?
1216960	1220560	Good. It's pretty good so far. I've played like a, like three or four hours. You just
1221840	1224800	halfway the second mission. Is there any other RPGs you can kind of compare to?
1226480	1232320	I don't know. It's a little bit different cause, cause you're kind of moving around with the
1232320	1237200	stylus and the, cause you're not, and actually cause there's an interesting system where you,
1237200	1241520	if you, you got to chase, sometimes you have to chase the enemies or run away from them. So you
1241520	1247520	have to basically have the characters running away or running towards the, uh, the, uh, the enemy.
1247520	1252000	So you have to like make them jump over boxes and stuff. So that kind of, so if you need to escape
1252000	1255360	from an enemy, you're going to kill you. You can try to do that. Or if they want to get away from
1255360	1260160	you, you have to chase them. So if you got four characters, it's really hard to sometimes to
1260160	1266080	actually keep everyone from hitting the boxes so that they don't, that they can catch up.
1266080	1271440	Cool. It sounds like this game might be redeeming the Sonic franchise a little bit after a relatively
1271440	1276560	last few week years. I actually haven't played any of the games and it's for the best. It's for
1276560	1279920	the best Bradley. If you want to stay a Sega fan boy, you probably should stay away from him.
1279920	1283840	All right. Uh, let's also ask Kick Up Boy. Uh, what, what's, what's one game you've been playing
1283840	1290720	this week? Well, um, I kind of haven't, haven't gotten over, um, Cod 4 at all yet. All right. A
1290720	1297120	shooter fan. It's amazing. Except you get those people that just like, Oh, on one on one, I can
1297120	1303680	kick your ass. And then we go on one on one and they leave shortly after that. So what would you
1303680	1311840	say is the singular best thing about that game? The best thing is gotta be just, Hmm. Uh, there's
1311840	1319040	not just one, uh, you looking forward to the COD five. Yeah. Yes and no. Just, they kind of went
1319040	1323440	back in time. So I'm kind of like, Oh, I feel like a back to the future kind of thing. What's
1323440	1329360	something they need to do in COD five they didn't do for four. Um, they need to, um, make sure no
1329360	1335280	juggernaut is allowed. Cause that's just kind of wimpy. All right. There you have it. All right.
1335280	1339840	Um, we're going to move into some, uh, news here, but after some housekeeping here real quick.
1339840	1344960	And, uh, first off I want to say, you know, cause I say it every week, join us on a live journal.
1344960	1349920	Our username on life journals, orange lounge or a my space where orange lounge radio, uh, on
1349920	1354320	Facebook or the OL army. And now on Twitter, we're OLR. Yes. That's four different sites and four
1354320	1359520	different names. Go figure. It just never works out. Um, also I want to say this, uh, since we
1359520	1364960	have been doing this diligently for 300 episodes, uh, we are taking next week off. There will be no
1364960	1371760	show next week. So there you have it. Cause we earned it. We will be providing live footage of,
1371760	1376400	um, a colonoscopy. No, I'm not. Here's the, here's the deal. I'm not having a colonoscopy,
1376400	1378960	but you guys might remember if you've been listening to the show this year, I had some
1378960	1383520	medical issues, um, back in April, um, that kept me out of the show for a week. Uh, I'm having
1383520	1386560	surgery Wednesday and that's why there's not going to be a show on Sunday because I'm still
1386560	1390080	going to be recovering. Um, I'm having a gallbladder removal. I'm sure I mentioned
1390080	1393840	this a couple of weeks ago. It's not a big deal. Other people have had it done. It's laparoscopic,
1393840	1397840	so it's not going to be a big deal, but I am planning to pretty much be out of everything
1397840	1403040	for a week. So there you have it. So now you understand. So no, no kicking and screaming.
1403040	1407200	There's no show. Take a chance to play some more games or listen to one of our other
1407200	1414560	wonderful shows, uh, that we co broadcast with on all games radio. Um, so let's move into some
1414560	1419360	gaming news then tonight, I think if we're ready. Yes. All right. All right. Uh, well,
1420160	1425680	you may remember the, uh, new PSP 3000 was announced and is finally made it to the market.
1425680	1433440	Um, although it's not really being received that well, um, problem is apparently the new advanced,
1433440	1440400	um, LCD screen that's on it is causing some issues with scan lines, noticeable scan lines,
1440400	1447920	and it looks very bad. Um, it is now a little bit brighter and the colors are a little bit better,
1447920	1454240	but the scan lines look like crap and Sony is apparently looking into the problem right now.
1454240	1463760	Um, but no sort of fix is, um, being, uh, taken, you know, being done. And, um, so since this is
1463760	1468080	a phenomenon that is caused by hardware characteristics, there is no plan to fix it
1468080	1476720	with the system software update. So you might want to hold on to those PSP 2000s and forgo the
1476720	1485520	built-in, um, microphone and I don't know, better, uh, questionably better LCD screen.
1485520	1488480	Or maybe just wait a little while for it to get fixed. Is it possible that they're
1488480	1494800	going to like kind of fix these? Um, they're going to have to replace them if that's the case.
1496480	1502480	Interesting. Um, well, what's kind of interesting also is that it seems like there might be some
1502480	1508800	type of very, uh, quiet under the radar recall going on right now. Um, I guess it's because
1508800	1513040	people are, you know, complaining about this and apparently the description actually got like this
1513040	1518640	slight word change going on. Um, instead of saying the system features an improved LCD screen,
1518640	1523600	it says the system features an advanced LCD screen. So you can kind of see that they might be,
1523600	1527520	uh, kind of admitting that there's something going on there. It kind of reminds me of was it, uh,
1527520	1532640	if anyone's watched Invader Zim when he's introduced to his sidekick Gur, he's like,
1533440	1537600	um, he kind of looks broken. They're all, he's not broken. He's advanced.
1540160	1544800	Well, here's the other interesting thing is that amazon.com just suddenly canceled a bunch of
1544800	1549600	pre-orders for the PSP 3000. Um, some folks had the limited edition four gigabyte memory
1549600	1553760	entertainment pack for this thing reserved. Amazon sent everybody emails that said, um,
1553760	1558720	that the item was not available from the sources so that they canceled all the orders.
1558720	1565840	Yeah. In fact, we got some similar that, um, they were expected in probably this week, I guess,
1566480	1573040	but now they've been delayed to middle of January. So there's something going on. Something
1573040	1578160	is afoot at the circle K. All right. So there you have it. Um, I don't know what's going on with the
1578160	1583360	PSP 3000, but maybe you want to be cautious, play a friend's system, play it in stores and see if
1583360	1587120	it's something that bugs you that bad, because I bet to a lot of gamers, um, they're not going
1587120	1592080	to give a shit to be honest. I mean, it looks pretty bad. I mean, but there's a lot of PSP
1592080	1597840	2000 systems out there and really all you're supposedly improving is the, you know, inner
1597840	1602480	the LCD screen, which obviously is not improved this time and a built-in microphone. So if
1602480	1606960	microphones aren't really big deal for you, I mean, you can go buy one for like 20 bucks.
1606960	1613200	I don't know. So I would just maybe hold off. Besides, why do you, why do you need to buy
1613200	1618720	another system? I mean, after all the last system update came about a year ago. All right. Well,
1621200	1626080	what was that? She didn't have a mic. I said, not to mention, there's hardly any new PSP games
1626080	1629840	coming out. They're like, here's a bunch of new systems without you. We've got like 20 games
1629840	1636320	coming out in the next six months. Have fun. All right. Well, we'll see. We'll see what continues
1636320	1639920	to develop, um, over there and hopefully some PSP games, a lot of good stuff in, um,
1639920	1645520	2009. We'll see. That could possibly be, but honestly, you know, my opinion on the PSP
1647360	1652800	actually is the same opinion I have on any system. It stinks only as good as the games that are on
1652800	1660640	it, but it does have purple lacrosse, which is a cute game. Okay. Well, this comes as an absolute
1660640	1667680	surprise to no one. Um, because what do you just like gasping into the microphone as if you're in
1667680	1674800	a porn? I'm no one. I'm no one. Do that. Do that a little bit more throaty. No, no, no, I don't.
1674800	1682400	No, no. Okay. Sorry. Anyway. Thank you, Rob. Now you have to mimic the master here.
1682400	1691440	No, I don't. Anyway. Um, well there was, um, the game was trademarked in July, but there is going
1691440	1697200	to be a Star Wars, the old Republic, which is the MMO that's based off of KOTOR, Knights of the Old
1697200	1703840	Republic. Also the term coined by our friend Krista Skrotor when she worked for Lucas back
1703840	1710720	in the day. Anyway. Um, with this, um, it says to be 300 years after, um, Knights of the Old Republic
1710720	1716720	two, which is 3,500 years before the film. And you can choose between either the Republic or the
1716720	1724720	Sith empire. You can either, um, be, uh, light side or dark side. Um, but you can be one of those
1724720	1732400	alignments within whatever your faction is. So I guess you could be chaotic neutral or lawful evil
1732400	1737760	or, Oh, wait, wrong game. Anyway. Um, there's two classes that have been revealed already. That's
1737760	1744720	the Sith, the Jedi, and they use lightsabers and the force. And we have no idea when it's coming
1744720	1751440	out or what it's coming out on, but, but, but, well, can I kill Jar Jar Binks? Jar Jar has not
1751440	1757440	been born yet or conceived. She could probably find, can I find Jar Jar's super great ancestor
1757440	1765520	and killer and super great cut off the fishy cock. That's the fishy cock.
1765520	1771120	Did you just tell me to go slice off the fishy cock? Fish do not have cocks. They deposit their
1771120	1775360	things into the ocean. But they're supposed to be human led creatures. So I assume that there's
1775360	1782560	some cock involved. There's always cock involved. They're aquatic. Okay. Needless to say the
1782560	1788320	internet and the gamers on the internet all had a, needless to say the collective internet gamers
1788320	1793520	had a giant orgasm when this game was announced. Um, all their fish cocks went off at once.
1793520	1799680	Uh, I know there's a fountain of, there's a lot of people definitely looking forward to a KOTOR
1799680	1805680	MMO. A fountain of time ago. I've heard there are people that are going to leave wow for this.
1805680	1809520	We'll see, just like you and I are going to go play Star Trek. But I'm not leaving wow because
1809520	1815360	guess what? I am. I already left. I know. Fuck your KOTOR. We've got Star Trek MMO coming out.
1815360	1819680	We're going to have some Star Trek. There's a Star Trek MMO coming out? Where the fuck have
1819680	1824080	you been? Can I cream my shorts right now? Because I love Star Trek so much. Can you stand up so I
1824080	1830960	can see? Star Trek Online. This is still Star Trek Online. But what time period? Uh, after
1830960	1837360	current. I think it's set like 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. 35 or 40 years after Nemesis. Oh
1837360	1843120	man. So you get your own joystick for your ship. Or the Klingon Empire again though. No. Yes. All
1843120	1847920	right. And Janeway's dead and Picard's dead. Well Janeway could still be alive. Sounds awesome.
1847920	1857440	She can. All right. Anyhow. What? You can do customizing on your ship. So you can uh,
1857440	1861520	calibrate the dilithium crystal. And I want there to be an achievement called Red Shirt Massacre.
1862960	1868000	What? Oh wait. If it's set in that series. Okay. If it was red shirts first and then yellow in
1868000	1874720	Next Generation, then what color are they going to go to for the next series to come out? Magenta.
1874720	1880800	Magenta shirts. No. All right. I'm going to get some questions or some comments from chat.
1880800	1884480	Rasteel UT says, what I'm concerned about with Old Republic is that A,
1884480	1889360	virtually, this virtually guarantees no KOTOR 3 and B, Bioware's never done an MMO before. I
1889360	1895840	can't shake the idea that they might try to ape WoW. WoW's a good game. Let's see. We also have
1896960	1901600	GS68 says, I was going to get a PSP 3000 for Christmas, but I think I'll just save for a
1901600	1907520	desktop arcade pop and con. We'll see. SJ100 Matt says, I'm waiting for the OLR Starfleet.
1909840	1915840	All right. Let's move on with some more news. Back to PlayStation 3. Well, PlayStation Home
1915840	1922240	isn't even out yet and it's already been hacked. So, you know, just like anything else that's Sony,
1922240	1928880	especially the PSP, it has been hacked. The beta client has apparently been decrypted and hackers,
1928880	1938880	especially this guy I guess named streetskaterfu, apparently he has decrypted over 9,000 files
1938880	1945040	belonging to it and this is supposedly going to lead to better understanding how PlayStation 3
1945040	1951440	games and the PlayStation Network works and its structure. So apparently it's all backend stuff
1951440	1956880	and it'll allow you to, well, they're going to hopefully allow it to lead to other exploits and
1956880	1962400	possibly custom stuff for the cross media bar and all that fun stuff. I don't know, right now it's
1962400	1967040	a whole bunch of nothing, but it's progress and progress is always good, I guess. You know what
1967040	1973280	I think is hilarious? That these people do this as a hobby. You know what? I bet the one, I bet
1973280	1979120	the best way to end all the hacking and everything is to offer these guys jobs. Oh no, they wouldn't
1979120	1985920	do that. It would actually be original content. We don't want that. Pay them. We want rehashes
1985920	1992640	of everything. Yeah, but how long before Sony tries to close this gap? I mean, the home's not
1992640	2000640	even out yet really. Yeah, not very long, but you know, hey, I don't know, it's neat I guess. It's
2000640	2006960	fun to say, hey look, I hacked home. Hey, I'm skaterfu, I hacked home. But what's kind of neat
2006960	2014000	though, speaking of the home beta, if you do want to get into the home beta, just keep an eye out
2014000	2019520	for the next issue of Core, which is going to do some features behind the scenes regarding home,
2019520	2025200	and they're also going to have home beta entries. So you will be able to test home before home
2025200	2028960	launches, whenever home actually launches, although it's probably going to launch soon.
2028960	2033200	Well, do you remember on last week's show, there was a big to-do about the whole censorship in the
2033200	2039680	game LittleBigPlanet, and how one of the songs controversially quoted the Quran in its lyrics,
2039680	2043280	and Sony was going to patch, they were really nervous about this, they're going to patch the
2043280	2049680	game, take the lyrics out. It was retarded. Well, here's the thing, it's kind of an interesting
2049680	2054160	follow-up to this whole thing, is that we're kind of waiting for comment from the other side, like
2055200	2058640	what's the community going to think, what's the rest of the Muslim community going to think if
2058640	2062080	this word gets out there, this is in the game. Well, you might be surprised at what happened.
2062800	2069600	M. Zoudi Jasir, MD, and he is the president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy,
2069600	2074880	he talked to a website called Edge Gaming, or the Edge Game Network, and he said something
2074880	2080720	kind of interesting here. He said that censorship and Sony being willing to bend at the request for
2080720	2085920	censorship is counterproductive to the freedom of speech. Let me give you this quote, to demand that
2085920	2091360	the game be withdrawn is predicated on a society which gives theocrats who wish to control speech
2091360	2096240	far more value than the central principle of freedom of expression upon which the very practice
2096240	2101440	and freedom of religion is based. The fact that the music writer is a devout Muslim should highlight
2101440	2105680	that at the core of this issue is not about offending all Muslims but only about freedom
2105680	2110880	of expression and the free market. He says he himself does not endorse the use of the
2110880	2117360	Quran verses in non-educational video games, but he says in this case basically that the
2117360	2122800	first amendment takes precedence and that the Islamic foundation stands against all forms of
2122800	2127600	censorship. So, interesting. I think that's beautiful and isn't that sort of what we said
2127600	2134640	last week? In a way, in a way, so it's uh it's it it is kind of interesting to see that now Sony
2134640	2139280	has almost a little bit of egg on it they just can't win with this. Rice Princess was called and
2139280	2147040	she said censorship equals... Thank you. Is she coming tonight? Actually she's she's sick so she's
2147040	2151040	gonna try to make it. Isn't she far princess now? Yeah she is far princess. No she's sick she's
2151040	2155200	gonna try to make it though. All right. But you know everybody say a fire princess. All right.
2156560	2161280	All right. Let's move on and talk about some uh oh by the way just real quick note on Little
2161280	2166480	Big Planet the 1.02 patch is out now and uh it basically just strips the lyrics out of the song.
2166480	2171440	Yeah it doesn't take the song out just removes the lyrics which is fine. There you go. Because
2171440	2175600	I didn't understand what they meant anyway so we're right here. Didn't didn't they have a
2175600	2180960	very habit to do about this way back in the day with that game War Gods didn't they didn't uh
2180960	2184800	when the tracks in that game quote the Quran or something they took that out. Oh who knows.
2185680	2189120	This has been an issue for a while with other games you'd think people would learn.
2190160	2194880	I honestly... It just seems like bullshit to me the whole time. It really is. Oh sorry I should
2194880	2201040	be watching my language. Oh fuck that okay. It's like I said last week if they wanted to
2201040	2204000	be offended at somebody they should have been offended at the artist that made the song
2204000	2209280	who which I think is completely retarded anyway since he himself as stated was a devout Muslim so
2210400	2214080	whatever. Yeah but isn't that so he he was a Muslim the guy that wrote the song because there's like
2214080	2220080	you know like there's Ninju and that's made like by a Jewish guy like have you seen Ninju? No.
2220080	2223520	No I haven't. All right before we unravel more controversy on the program tonight

2580800	2586800	Auto IV all coming out this week. Again, that's Xbox 360. On the PlayStation 3, I imagine very

2592640	2598800	I guess some type of... No, is that the new one? No, we're waiting for V, aren't we?
2600000	2604960	So, I don't know why this is just now coming out. Grand Theft Auto IV? Oh, never mind. I'm getting
2604960	2609200	confused because right above it I'm reading Grand Turismo. Never mind. Hello. Okay, so yes, Japan
2609200	2614880	finally gets their version of Grand Theft Auto IV. Grand Turismo V Prologue does come out in Japan
2614880	2619920	this week. Spec 3. And Little Big Planet also makes its way to Japan this week on the 30th.
2619920	2627440	And Grand Turismo V Prologue hasn't come out in... This is Spec 3, so it's probably like new...
2627440	2633200	It's probably different cars to get people to buy it again. Sorry. Hey, now wait a minute.
2633200	2637280	Sorry for the use of that term, but that's gay. Seriously. Wait a minute, wait a minute,
2637280	2641040	wait a minute, wait a minute. I need to play something for Loki. Hold on, stop the show.
2641040	2644720	Stop the show. I need to play something for Loki here.
2644720	2654080	Hey, check out this shit, right? Right? It's so gay. It's really gay. Look at those pants.
2654080	2659440	Please don't say that. What? Don't say that something is gay when you mean that something
2659440	2666480	is dumb or stupid. It's insulting. It's like if I thought this pepper shaker was stupid and I said,
2666480	2674000	man, this pepper shaker is so 16-year-old boy with a cheesy mustache. Just saying. When you
2674000	2681600	say that's so gay, do you realize what you say? Knock it off. She's so sassy. Me too.
2681600	2687760	All right. Her show got canceled, so she sucks. I love her. I just downloaded one of her routines.
2687760	2694960	All right. That's all right. I completely understand, you know, the use of, you know,
2694960	2697920	gay and stuff, but I know, I know. I'm just messing with you. That's the whole point. I
2697920	2702160	know you don't really mean it. On the Nintendo Wii, nevermind. I'm not going to get political
2702160	2709040	right now. Nintendo Wii, My Sims Kingdom comes out this week, as does Bokuju Monogatari,
2709040	2716880	Waku Waku Animal March, yay, on the Wii, as well as Hula Wii, Mina Di Furo Odoro,
2716880	2722480	and Shape Boxing, We Day Enjoy Diet. It's probably Everybody Hula Hoop,
2724160	2728960	which would be a very interesting game. I don't know how you make a game out of that.
2728960	2735600	Hey, on the PlayStation 2, Scarlet, Nichijou no Kaiyou Kaisen comes out, as well as Thunder Force
2735600	2744000	6 comes out from Sega, and Yumemi Hakusho, Second Dream makes its way to the PlayStation 2.
2744720	2751040	On the Nintendo DS, ChocoBox comes out, Dr. Slump and Arale-chan.
2751040	2754960	Is ChocoBox chocobo-boxing? Because that would be amazing.
2754960	2758240	Dr. Slump was done by the artist that did Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z.
2758240	2760800	Ah, there you go. It is chocobo-boxing.
2760800	2762960	Let's get back to boxing with ChocoBox.
2762960	2767440	ChocoBox is not a game. It's a case for your DS.
2769840	2771840	What are they making chocobo-boxing?
2771840	2772720	That'd be pretty awesome.
2773920	2778240	Tales of Innocence gets a price reduction, and a game called Vitamin Y comes out.
2778960	2780400	Why? Because.
2781920	2786080	Lastly, on the Sony PSP, is there anything coming out this week?
2786080	2789440	Well, you actually would be surprised. Yes, there's quite a bit coming out this week.
2789440	2794880	Cardinal Arc Portable, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G gets a price reduction into the best,
2794880	2796960	as does Rockman Rockman.
2798480	2801360	That would just be, you know, you know how they remade Mega Man 1 for the PSP.
2801360	2801860	It's just that.
2802640	2803360	It's that whole thing.
2804240	2805920	All right, that's it for Japanese release dates.
2805920	2807840	Let's go back to some more gaming news.
2807840	2808720	Do we gotta?
2808720	2809360	Yes, we gotta.
2810240	2812480	Well, this is about death.
2813200	2813700	Cool.
2813700	2816740	ULTIMATE FINAL CHARACTER DEATH.
2818180	2826180	A 43-year-old Japanese woman was arrested for killing her virtual husband on MapleStory.
2827300	2829860	I know, where's our stupid person music, Rob?
2831380	2833460	Wait, did she kill him in-game?
2833460	2835300	She killed him in-game.
2835300	2836020	Oh, okay.
2836020	2837700	But she got arrested for killing him in-game?
2838500	2839620	Or did she kill him for real?
2839620	2840340	Here's what happened.
2840340	2841140	No, she killed him in-
2841140	2841620	She-
2841620	2842340	This is what happened.
2842340	2844020	She, um, she's a piano teacher.
2846900	2854340	43-year-old piano teacher was furious because, um, she had been divorced in-game.
2855540	2860020	So she accessed his login and deleted his character.
2861380	2864180	So she killed him in-game.
2864180	2871380	She's, um, in jail in Sapporo, um, and she's facing charges of illegally accessing a
2871380	2872980	computer and manipulating data.
2873460	2877300	Um, her in-game husband was a 33-year-old office worker.
2877940	2884180	And, um, I, I really don't know what he thinks, so there's no comment about that.
2884180	2890020	But this happened last May and, um, the woman could, um, pay fines and potentially
2890020	2892100	a five-year jail sentence if she's convicted.
2894740	2896020	Dude, it's MapleStory.
2896020	2896740	Who gives a shit?
2896740	2897380	God, I know!
2897380	2900660	Isn't that the biggest irony in this whole crappy story?
2900660	2901540	It's-
2901540	2902580	Get over yourself!
2902580	2904100	It's fucking MapleStory.
2904100	2906020	And besides that, what does it matter?
2906020	2906900	Oh my God.
2906900	2907380	Thank God.
2907380	2908420	I hope I can't-
2908420	2911860	She probably deleted, like, a couple years worth of data and-
2912500	2915140	I hope I can't be held accountable for all the people I killed.
2915140	2916660	You spend time working on that kind of shit.
2916660	2919380	DJ Dark Knight says it's a huge crime in Japan.
2919380	2921380	I- no, look, this is the thing.
2921380	2929300	I, I understand it and honestly, I, I would, you know, want some sort of, you know, retaliation.
2929300	2931220	She did break the law.
2932180	2937460	She illegally accessed his information and she broke the law.
2937460	2942980	However, I just think it's so fucking retarded that this is MapleStory!
2944260	2944820	It's free!
2945860	2946340	It's Ma-
2946340	2946980	Okay, okay.
2946980	2950900	I would be pissed off if someone did that to my Ragnarok account.
2950900	2953380	I would be pissed off if that happened on my Ragnarok account.
2954340	2958180	You know, but it's not the end of the world.
2958180	2959540	Five years in jail?
2959540	2962180	I mean, God, pissing you off is bad enough.
2962180	2962900	Can you imagine the phone call?
2962900	2965060	What do you mean pissing me off is bad enough?
2965060	2967540	What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Rob?
2967540	2968100	Exactly.
2968100	2969620	Exactly as it was intended.
2969620	2971620	Can you imagine the, the phone call?
2971620	2974580	I'd like to report a murder of my character in MapleStory.
2974580	2977220	Okay, see, I was thinking of the World of Warcraft-
2977220	2977860	Hello?
2977860	2978980	Uh, South Park episode.
2981380	2984660	It's like, and, and he's killing people's characters.
2984660	2988020	Mom! Bathroom! Bathroom!
2990260	2991860	I am such an achievement, Hornau.
2992500	2994820	Um, anyhow, hey, let's move on with the news.
2997460	3000660	Sorry, I've been distracted because the doctor has boobs now.
3001380	3002740	And boobs are distracting.
3003380	3004180	Uh, anyways-
3004180	3004580	Ew.
3005220	3005540	So-
3005540	3007540	So that's what kind of doctor you are.
3007540	3008340	That's a doctor.
3008900	3009620	Hello, doctor.
3009620	3010260	Now, um-
3010260	3010660	Doctor.
3010660	3018260	Apparently, Guitar Hero World Tour is facing some drum issues, um, as some other, um, hosts,
3018260	3021380	uh, so, uh, viciously-
3021380	3023620	Eloquently put it on previous shows.
3023620	3029780	Viciously described, um, there's some issues with the drums, um, not sensing the hits,
3029780	3030740	um, in this case-
3032260	3034340	Sorry, that's to come later, ignore that.
3035620	3038500	I let the, I let the audio run too long again, my bad.
3038500	3038900	Shame, shame.
3038900	3041220	Fucking drums aren't fucking working right.
3041220	3043140	Anyway, so the drums aren't working correctly.
3043140	3049540	Basically, they're either not sensing hits, or they're just playing, not doing anything.
3049540	3051380	They're faulty like this show.
3051380	3052500	They're very faulty.
3053300	3057940	I mean, personally, I kind of called that they were faulty, but for whole different
3057940	3058340	reasons.
3058340	3062820	I mean, the thing looks like it's made out of PVC, and was seriously, like, rocking when
3062820	3065220	people were playing it, and not rocking in the good way.
3065220	3067540	But, I don't know.
3069460	3074180	I think as, uh, Bobby Blackwolf put it on his show, if they're gonna brag that their
3074180	3078500	instruments are better than, you know, Rock Band's instruments, then maybe they should
3078500	3078820	work.
3079940	3081780	Let's start with the working first.
3084500	3087060	That's the only sound my, uh, Guitar Hero drums will make.
3087060	3089620	I have, I have pumpkiny goodness in me, by the way, Rob.
3089620	3090100	Thank you.
3090100	3090820	You're welcome.
3090820	3093060	We're eating pumpkin bagels here in Studio Justino.
3093060	3093460	We are?
3093460	3094580	I am.
3095380	3096020	Yeah, that's fine.
3096020	3097780	Actually, eat that Halloween candy.
3097780	3099620	I can't have the candy, and John doesn't want it.
3100180	3101460	So, bring the thing out here.
3101460	3102660	Make everybody eat it.
3102660	3103700	Give some to Justin TV.
3103700	3104580	I don't care.
3104580	3104980	All right.
3104980	3107140	Hey, um, big news this week.
3107140	3107620	Oh, my God.
3107620	3112180	Huge news about, um, something, uh, we here at Orange Mountains Radio used to cover every
3112180	3113460	year, and then kind of stopped.
3114100	3115780	E3 is coming back.
3116740	3117300	That's right.
3117300	3120660	E3 2009, uh, is coming back the way we know it.
3120660	3125300	Not this whole, like, scale down show we had, um, going on.
3126100	3131060	This whole scale down show we had going on for just the media only, and the super special
3131060	3132900	secret club invite is going away.
3134020	3135300	Basically, I hope so.
3135300	3137300	E3 is going to be just like it was before.
3137300	3140260	However, that doesn't mean that anybody's going to be able to get in.
3140260	3141460	It's not public.
3141460	3144260	It's just, you know, it's going to be back to the same audience.
3144260	3144660	Come on.
3144660	3147700	When it was originally going on anyways, it was almost public.
3147700	3152260	It's like I work at Walmart or I know someone that works at Walmart in the garden department
3152260	3156180	because they, you know, it's like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon or something like that.
3156180	3161380	It's like I work in a store that looks at video games and therefore, you know, I should
3161380	3161940	be able to go.
3161940	3163620	I have a crappy podcast on the internet.
3163620	3164820	It's been going for six years.
3164820	3165700	I get to go.
3165700	3166340	What?
3166340	3170020	This means that we need to get our business stuff set back up.
3170020	3171300	Yeah, we got to go.
3171300	3172340	We're going.
3172340	3172820	It'll be fun.
3172820	3174500	Yeah, that's going to be tough.
3174500	3178260	I'm going to try to get the wife to let me go, but uh, ouch.
3178260	3179140	Tell her Fable 3 will be there.
3179140	3180900	This is how it works at my house.
3180900	3182260	Hey Dan, I'm going to E3.
3183620	3184020	Okay.
3184020	3185140	Yeah, but you can do that.
3186100	3186980	He can come with me.
3187940	3190020	By the way, he's come with me every year.
3191620	3196180	The website Joystiq, that's Joystiq with a Q, actually interviewed the president of the
3196180	3201540	ESA, Doug Lowenstein, and he actually said if you had to give, they asked him if you
3201540	3206020	had to give E3 a six letter word or less tagline, what would it be?
3206020	3207140	And uh, I'm sorry.
3207700	3210660	Doug Lowenstein was the former president of the ESA.
3210660	3211860	Now it's Mike Gallagher.
3212740	3213780	Sorry, my bad.
3213780	3215140	I just haven't been to E3 in so long.
3215700	3219940	Mike Gallagher calls it the must attend event of 2009.
3221140	3221940	That's what he's calling it.
3222580	3225220	And they're saying it's going to be 40,000 or more in attendance.
3226020	3227860	I believe that the last E3 was 70,000.
3227860	3228980	And then they're complaining.
3228980	3233140	Why are there so many people going in there and then Paris Hilton will be there pimping
3233140	3233780	out whatever.
3233780	3235940	I want to know what's the heavy cynicism for there in the back.
3238900	3245140	When it was an industry only thing, it still was going down the tubes and you had better
3245140	3250260	things like, you know, Leipzig and uh, PAX as the true gamers conventions.
3251140	3254820	I mean, even for the industry, it's just not that good anymore.
3254820	3257460	I'm kind of curious what effect this is going to have on PAX.
3257460	3260100	If that's going to cause less people to want to go to PAX now, because they'll want to
3260100	3261700	use their vacation on E3.
3261700	3263780	Cause not everybody can take vacation all the time.
3263780	3264580	You know what I mean?
3264580	3268820	Honestly, if I had to choose between the two though, to be perfectly honest, I want to
3268820	3269700	go to PAX again.
3269700	3270900	I really want to go to PAX again.
3270900	3272260	You know, PAX was a lot of fun.
3272260	3275220	PAX was more of like the gamer show, but I'm a greedy bastard.
3275220	3275940	I'm going to go to both.
3275940	3276420	Hello.
3276420	3277780	No, I'd love to go to both.
3277780	3283060	I'd especially like to see what this E3 revival is, you know?
3283060	3287700	But if I had to pick between one or the other, I would pick PAX.
3287700	3288500	There you go.
3288500	3292500	Uh, so orange launch radio live from E3 this June.
3292500	3292900	What?
3292900	3295540	If we do go to E3, we're totally freaking going to Disneyland.
3296420	3297380	We'll see what we can do.
3297380	3297860	We are.
3298660	3299300	Yes, ma'am.
3300900	3303700	Cause I, so what?
3303700	3304260	Tea cups.
3305140	3307700	Tea cups for the win and California screaming.
3307700	3307940	All right.
3308500	3311060	Let's move on with the news or we'll never get to Disneyland.
3311060	3311300	Yes.
3311300	3314980	But, you know what Disneyland could use more of?
3314980	3315540	Zombies!
3316340	3318100	You know what Call of Duty is getting more of?
3318100	3319940	Um, my story.
3320500	3321140	Well, I'm sorry.
3321140	3323620	You were just talking about Disneyland and I stopped listening.
3323620	3324120	Okay.
3324980	3325480	Go ahead.
3326500	3328900	Well, it was E3's revival.
3328900	3330180	What happens to E4All?
3331060	3332980	It gets flushed down the toilet.
3338020	3339300	I don't have a toilet flush noise.
3339300	3343540	Yup, there's no more E for All and I'm laughing my ass off.
3343540	3346340	Why? Why all the negativity? There's too much cynicism in here tonight.
3346340	3350340	I'm just laughing my ass off at all the people who said that, um,
3350340	3353980	that E for All is gonna be the end all, the place to go,
3353980	3356980	and we're gonna be all at E for All. And I'm like...
3356980	3361100	Well, it definitely was the end all. Fuck you, I'm going to PAX.
3361100	3365860	Nice. But seriously, I've heard from so many people about
3365860	3369220	oh, E for All this and E for All that and I'm like, screw you.
3369220	3374740	But they had fatality. Whatever. We got to, we got to do fatalities in
3374740	3378940	DC vs Mortal Kombat, okay? Oh my god, we got someone who holds his, holds his mouth funny.
3378940	3382900	Rob and I got to have the Katana Catwoman fight and that was
3382900	3387980	epic. It was pretty cool. Plus, I got to meet Jonathan Coulton and Wil Wheaton and
3387980	3389740	I couldn't do that at E for All.
3389740	3393180	Uh, Jenai in chat makes the, uh,
3393180	3396340	mandatory joke here that I think is pretty clever. E for End.
3396340	3399940	Did you hear that one, Jenai?
3399940	3404940	E for End. Aww, that's perfect. I was telling Mel about Wil Wheaton signing my iPhone
3404940	3407060	and it rubbing off by the end of the day. But you saw it.
3407060	3411500	I did see it. I'd said, now my phone is an extra limited edition and so he
3411500	3413060	put a 1 slash 1 on it.
3413060	3418300	That was pretty funny. Alright, now we can talk about zombies.
3418300	3422940	That's what, because that's what you're going to see at E3 this year. A bunch of unshowered, unslept zombies.
3422940	3426380	We should hand out care packs.
3426380	3430900	Okay, no, we should, we should hand out con care packs like they did at AX that one year
3430900	3435180	where they handed out deodorant and soap. Yeah, but unless you're going to put it on them
3435180	3439020	yourself, it's not going to do any good. What's this? Cans of
3439020	3444540	Axe. I can't use this, start away. Axe smells freaking good. Axe is better than confunk.
3444540	3447500	Confunk is good. Confunk is...
3447500	3451140	No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know what smells better than confunk?
3451140	3455140	Cat piss. I'll take your word for it. How about zombies?
3455140	3461340	Yes, zombies. Apparently the megaton bomb that was dropped by Game Trailers TV
3461340	3462340	was that
3462340	3466340	Call of Duty World of War is going to feature a four-player co-op zombie mode.
3466340	3470060	That totally doesn't rip off of another game that's very similar having a
3470060	3471100	four-player co-op
3471100	3474260	zombie mode in it. Left 4 Dead.
3474260	3477260	So I guess, you know, hey they want to make sure that people know that their game has
3477260	3478380	zombies too.
3478380	3484820	Wow, that's so World of War. You know, I remember the zombie wars back in World War II.
3484820	3488420	My grandpa used to tell me all about those, how the zombies would attack and
3488420	3488980	everything.
3488980	3492700	Ah, yes, the zombies.
3492700	3496940	Thank goodness that we, you know, defeated them and showed them democracy.
3496940	3500740	Democracy! Bringing it to the rest of the world. And
3500740	3506460	no zombies, because zombies are bad. But thankfully though Treyarch is able to come
3506460	3507540	back and tell the
3507540	3510900	you know, lost battles of zombies. You know,
3510900	3514700	the part that was left out of the history books. Conspiracy, I say!
3514700	3519220	No, but seriously, they're going to have four-player zombies and you'll be able to do
3519220	3522420	zombie stuff. Can you eat brains? Yes or no?
3522420	3527300	Well this sounds like it's basically, it's kind of weird though. There's a whole bunch of
3527300	3529220	games this fall that have zombie things in them. Like
3529220	3533700	Saints Row 2 has zombies in it. There's like a zombie game within the game.
3533700	3537700	And now there's a zombie game within this. And then there's a zombie game coming out.
3537700	3538420	There's zombie
3538420	3542180	Xbox Live Arcade games. Zombie PlayStation Network games. It's like, seriously,
3542180	3543140	Moonwalker!
3543140	3547580	Brains or no brains? Actually, I do have to say there's something that completely
3547580	3549260	bothers me about zombie games.
3549260	3553300	About games with zombies in them. How you don't have a stench meter.
3553300	3556420	In zombie movies and zombie games,
3556420	3561100	why is it that you can't tell where the fucking zombies are by how much their decayed
3561100	3565300	asses stink? They're decaying bodies. They're going to smell
3565300	3569020	like rotten meat. Maybe someday there'll be a smell-o-vision.
3569020	3573220	But, you know, nobody in zombie movies are so surprised that the zombies are there
3573220	3578220	when they should have been able to freakin' smell corpse stench. Yeah, I know. You have games like, I don't know,
3578220	3582620	Thief with sound meters. Why can't you have smell meters? Maybe there's a lot of zombies and so
3582620	3586100	because they all smell like rotting flesh, the whole place smells like rotting
3586100	3589300	flesh so you can't tell where it's coming from. It should still be stronger the closer you
3589300	3590240	get to that much
3590240	3593700	contained stench. It's just... It's like an anime con.
3593700	3597700	It's just like last night. You can tell when you're getting close to the dealer's room
3597700	3602420	by the stink. No, no, no, no. You can tell when you're getting close to the cosplay
3602420	3603500	competition
3603500	3607160	It's like a Dave Matthews Band concert. You can tell when you're getting close to
3607160	3608500	the smell of marijuana.
3608500	3613460	No, when you're getting close to the cosplay competition is when you stop
3613460	3613980	smelling
3613980	3617540	funk and start smelling other things. I don't know if you heard Drew, but
3617540	3620540	the Grateful Dead. The one guy's keeping on trucking in heaven.
3620540	3624540	I don't know if you've heard. Alright. He's gratefully dead.
3624540	3628300	Anyhow. Unless he's a zombie! In which case,
3628300	3631500	you need to know how to defeat zombies by playing this game. Or
3631500	3635420	Left 4 Dead. Or Saints Row 2. Or another zombie game. World of Warcraft.
3635420	3640820	Which has also started the zombie invasion. That's right. Zombie invasion has been hitting World of
3640820	3642960	Warcraft and there's been just craziness going on.
3642960	3646180	Earlier in the week, there was infections going on. If you would kill an
3646180	3647180	infected critter
3647180	3651380	or the like, you would get turned into a zombie in 10 minutes and then you
3651380	3653900	could create other zombies. It was like a disease that was spread around.
3653900	3657980	Well, as the week's been going on, now it takes 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.
3657980	3661860	15 seconds? I thought it was one minute. No, that happened to me earlier today. It took me 15 seconds to get turned into a zombie.
3661860	3665060	The more you get hit by zombies, the faster they shave off
3665060	3668340	times. You gotta visit an Argent healer.
3668340	3672620	Or if they haven't been turned into a zombie. Or you have a priest or paladin
3672620	3676580	remove the disease. All last night I was going on my priest
3676580	3680580	through Orgrimmar making sure all the auction house street dealers were
3680580	3684420	clean. Yeah, apparently it's a popular thing to do is turn yourself into a zombie and then do
3684420	3688360	a zombie explode. Because one thing you can do, you can just explode. You can self-destruct as a zombie
3688360	3692100	and spread your infection everywhere. So a lot of people have just been walking into the
3692100	3694060	auction house and exploding.
3694060	3699060	And apparently they don't like the people who are cleaning up after the
3699060	3699740	zombies.
3699740	3703420	They don't like the priests. They don't like the pallys. Oh, you're ruining our fun.
3703420	3706740	Hi, you guys are going to low-level zones and killing everything. Exactly.
3706740	3710900	You know, does anyone find this slightly offensive that there's
3710900	3715380	people walking around into, I don't know, public buildings and exploding?
3715380	3718940	I mean... There's zombies. Don't blame them, there are zombies.
3718940	3722380	Everything is okay when it's zombies and green blood.
3722380	3726060	It's not real. There were zombies that ate too many Twinkies. So if some zombies flew a
3726060	3728300	plane into a building, that would be okay too.
3728300	3732780	They're zombies! Matt... I'm just checking.
3732780	3736860	Alright, because this is the World of Warcraft game that you're playing, and I don't see any
3736860	3738220	recalls on that. Yes, alright.
3738220	3741620	Well, we did have people getting infected and then
3741620	3744900	flying to other cities and then exploding when they got there. The
3744900	3746220	zombified in mid-flight.
3746220	3751080	You can't explode in mid-flight? They can't explode in mid-flight, but they can explode as soon as they land.
3751080	3754780	Tenris Murkblood is a new boss that you can fight in Karazhan. My guild just took him
3754780	3756700	down today, and it was actually a fun fight.
3756700	3760180	But you only are going to be able to see him for 10 days, which basically means if
3760180	3761980	you don't play him tonight or Monday,
3761980	3766900	you have one chance because of the resets in Karazhan. So, he drops an axe that is
3766900	3770580	awesome. He will drop this axe every time. He only drops two things. A little bat pet for
3770580	3771520	everybody in the raid,
3771520	3775500	and an axe that when you use it,
3775500	3779140	your character suddenly becomes a zombie or an undead, basically.
3779140	3782420	It starts jamming like it's Guitar Hero. It goes...
3782420	3784860	It's awesome. Rob, get an extra one.
3784860	3791820	We can't. Only Nathan got one today. Look at that! Now they're ripping off Darkstalkers! Awesome!
3791820	3794780	Arcanite Ripper!
3794780	3796020	Arcanite can rip off.
3796020	3799940	Yeah, and I see XLink in chat says, Grand Theft Auto IV has zombies too.
3799940	3803500	Yeah, they started putting out this thing like it was going to be an expansion or something like that,
3803500	3805700	but really they're just talking about the stupid
3805700	3810580	viral achievement that they've had since the beginning of the game, when it came out.
3810580	3812100	And...
3812100	3816980	Tom, talk about like non-news, but they decided, hey, we're going to jump in on the zombie
3816980	3818660	fun as well, even though
3818660	3822180	this has been around forever. I want to point out, since we just started tonight's show,
3822180	3825660	a new phase just kicked in. Phase five and a half just started tonight
3825660	3829580	as we went live. Apparently what's happened, now there are quests all of a sudden
3829580	3832580	available in the main cities that send you to the faction leader,
3832580	3837260	and at some point you're going to be whispered by some type of either
3837260	3840740	a frozen shade or a plagued brain that's going to be taunting you to join their
3840740	3841860	forces.
3841860	3845260	And there's some type of quest going on to hopefully clean the world
3845260	3847660	of the plague. Interesting.
3847660	3851460	So it's all going on right now in the world of Warcraft.
3851460	3853740	Bathroom.
3853740	3856860	Bathroom.
3856860	3860460	More gaming news.
3860460	3865060	Well, there's another game called Pain,
3865060	3869100	and there is a character showing up in Pain
3869100	3874140	that you can beat the shit out of. Guess who that would be?
3874140	3878220	I don't know. David Hasselhoff!
3878220	3881500	And he actually thinks that it's
3881500	3885700	completely, he actually said that it was hysterical, he's quoted as saying that,
3885700	3887220	and that
3887220	3890620	he thinks that it's really great that he gets to be in it.
3890620	3895320	And there's also his version of Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?
3895320	3896920	as
3896920	3902340	the title to an in-game track, so I think that's pretty fun. Wow, you know that's just...
3902340	3906180	What the fuck was that? Rob's computer farted. I don't know what's going on. Well, hello
3906180	3910940	Rice Princess, glad to see you just arrived. I think a zombie is attacking us, actually.
3910940	3915300	What the hell was that about? That was some weird shit. Anyways, I was going to say,
3915300	3918540	that's reason enough to hurt him.
3918540	3922220	Well, also he's doing his own voice, so this information was provided to me by
3922220	3925180	the lovely and talented Zoss.
3925180	3929220	Now I want to point out there's a new song available in Pain.
3929220	3934220	I can't stop this feeling
3934220	3938220	deep inside of me
3938220	3941220	Girl, you just don't realize
3941220	3944220	what you do to me
3944220	3948220	I couldn't resist. You gotta love a guy that actually is famous for doing that shit.
3948220	3952220	I mean, seriously, you know what, it's like, I wonder if he's just like,
3952220	3956220	what can I do that's so ridiculous that people would still like me? And he keeps
3956220	3960220	making these songs and he's like, okay, people gotta hate me now. And then they're still like
3960220	3964220	buying his albums and he's still rich and putting them on TV shows and stuff.
3964220	3968220	I don't know.
3968220	3972220	He's still convinced that he's instrumental in the Berlin Wall coming down.
3972220	3976220	Rama in chat says... They love him in Germany. Rama in chat
3976220	3980220	says, I actually like this song. I only read that so that our, you know,
3980220	3984220	thousands of listeners could hear that. That's Rama, R-A-N-M-A, likes that song.
3984220	3988220	DSSJ100 Matt says, we got Hofrolled.
3988220	3992220	Yes you did. Yes you did. Alright, a little
3992220	3996220	more gaming news than the classic Game of the Week and then a break.
3996220	4000220	If you bought Rock Band 2, you'll know that on the back of your manual, it says you can get 20
4000220	4004220	free tracks available at a later date. Well, that later date is
4004220	4008220	now November 4th and there are 20 different tracks you can get.
4008220	4012220	And to be honest, I don't know any of these artists at all.
4012220	4016220	So, real quick I'm going to read them off. The 88 Sons and Daughters.
4016220	4020220	Authority Zero, no regrets. Between the
4020220	4024220	Buried and Me, prepare to the sequel.
4024220	4028220	The Cab with Bounce. The Chevelle's, get it on.
4028220	4032220	The Cocktail Slippers, give it to me. Dealership
4032220	4036220	with Database Corrupted. End Ever After
4036220	4040220	with I Wanna Be Your Man. The Ghost Town's Ashes to Fire.
4040220	4044220	Hollywood Undead, Young. The Cutlass,
4044220	4048220	The Feeling. The Len Price 3,
4048220	4052220	If I Ain't Got You. Lesley Roy, I'm Gone, I'm Going.
4052220	4056220	Opiate for the Masses, Burn You Down.
4056220	4060220	Semi-Precious Weapons, Magnetic Baby.
4060220	4064220	Shamius with Like a Fool. Magnetic Baby?
4064220	4068220	I don't know. The Nuno 2, Crazy Tuesday.
4068220	4072220	Tickle Me Pink with The Time is Wrong.
4072220	4076220	Under oath with Desperate Times, Desperate Measures, and X Japan with
4076220	4080220	IV. I have no idea any of those songs.
4080220	4084220	I know that actually we were really excited about getting some X Japan.
4084220	4088220	But hey, at least they're free, and free is awesome.
4088220	4092220	No bitching, it's free. And there might be some cool songs in there that you've never heard of before.
4092220	4096220	So make sure that you register before the 4th, I mean you probably can afterwards, but if you
4096220	4100220	want to make sure you get it day 1, register at rockband.com slash
4100220	4104220	bonus tracks, and they will send you an email with your code
4104220	4108220	to download them once they become available.
4108220	4112220	Awesome. What about what they're releasing for the people that want to pay?
4112220	4116220	Well, for the people that want to pay, there's going to be some other stuff coming out as well.
4116220	4120220	Including, they've got Hong Kong Gardens,
4120220	4124220	Kiss Them For Me, and Killing Jar.
4124220	4128220	Yay! And that's all by Soozee and the band Cheese.
4128220	4132220	Yay! Which is like one of the greatest bands ever. Dammit by Blink
4132220	4136220	182, that song that Rob was talking about the little girl singing earlier
4136220	4140220	in Sing Star. Let's see here, looks like
4140220	4144220	Metal Onan by the Silver Star, or Silver Sun
4144220	4148220	Pickups. Well Thought Out Twinkies by
4148220	4152220	or Twinkles, Twinkies would be funny though. Well Thought Out Twinkles
4152220	4156220	by Silver Sun Pickups, and Pretty In Pink by Psychedelic Furs.
4156220	4160220	That's cool. You know what though, who cares, because it has Soozee and the band Cheese
4160220	4164220	in it, so all the rest of that is just crap.
4164220	4168220	Oh my god,
4168220	4172220	Rob are you straight now? No, I just
4172220	4176220	love Soozee and the band Cheese, they're awesome. She was on the Basement Jacks song too.
4176220	4180220	They had a really cool video on top of it.
4180220	4184220	There you go. Kish Cash. It's funny, my band right now
4184220	4188220	thankfully, because I'm not playing Rock Band 2, but my friend is on my account
4188220	4192220	so it counts, but we're in the top 600 now.
4192220	4196220	Wow. Dang. Yes, I know, I'm
4196220	4200220	very pleased at my progress in the game. Oh, just to let
4200220	4204220	people know, our band name at my house is Detachable Penis.
4204220	4208220	Like the King Missile song. Did it not get banned? No. Interesting.
4208220	4212220	The one I've been playing in mostly is actually Shane's band, it's Emergency Kittens.
4212220	4216220	That's the name of our band. Does the Sassy Squad sing backup? No.
4216220	4220220	That's just a Warcraft fan. But is Fluffles Trainset the third?
4220220	4224220	No. Alright, hey, by the way
4224220	4228220	if you want a real band game, you know, the hell with Rock Band or Guitar Hero
4228220	4232220	get Rock Revolution. No, I'm kidding, I'm just so kidding. No, you want this
4232220	4236220	Strong Bad Episode 3, The Baddest of the Bands
4236220	4240220	is coming out. It's Episode 3, it comes out on the PC and WiiWare
4240220	4244220	when? Right now. Or Monday for those of you listening live, it's tomorrow.
4244220	4248220	October 27th, it's going to be as always 1,000 Wii Points or
4248220	4252220	$10. That's coming out from Telltale Games. So there you have it
4252220	4256220	those of you that are enjoying the Strong Bad games probably want to pick that up. And if you haven't
4256220	4260220	picked up a Strong Bad game yet, you might want to do that. And yes, I'm talking to myself
4260220	4264220	because I still have not played the Strong Bad series. I really need to. Is the
4264220	4268220	ban over, Rob? No, you know your boycott's not over yet, is it? No, I can play it on PC.
4268220	4272220	That's right. So that's what I plan to do. Oh, your boycott, because your memory
4272220	4276220	is full. Yeah, I'm boycotting the Wii download stuff. Your memory is full. Although, well
4276220	4280220	I don't know, I'm iffy on it because they have announced the remedy for it.
4280220	4284220	Wait, what did, have you already announced that on the show, what the remedy is? Yeah, they
4284220	4288220	did announce they are going to let you run things off SD cards. But when's that happening, though?
4288220	4292220	That's a thing. So that's going to be a patch, right? Yeah, probably a patch. Alright, anyhow
4292220	4296220	hey, we're not even halfway done with this show yet, if you can believe it. We're going to take a
4296220	4300220	break here pretty soon. But first, we always like to end part A of our program by
4300220	4304220	taking a trip to the past and revisiting the archives and
4304220	4308220	trying to pick out a classic game of the week. Now, as I understand
4308220	4312220	though, tonight's game, because it is episode 300, Dark Sakura had to
4312220	4316220	pick like a fucking epic classic. Am I correct? I sure did.
4316220	4320220	Alright, well let's get to it.
4320220	4324220	My classic game, actually I'm not going to say the title of it to
4324220	4328220	begin with. It should begin with the intro to the game.
4328220	4332220	Which everyone will get from the first Tones.
4332220	4336220	And I'm getting grins from over here looking at my laptop.
4336220	4340220	Oh my god. Oh my god.
4340220	4344220	Oh my god.
4344220	4348220	Oh my god.
4348220	4352220	That only sounds like a porn star.
4352220	4356220	Oh yeah. Do we get it yet
4356220	4360220	kids? Oh yeah. No it's not Castlevania.
4360220	4364220	It's Gutsman.
4364220	4368220	Oh yeah. Tora is the first person to guess.
4368220	4372220	And stop spamming the room now please. You get a no prize.
4372220	4376220	Stop it! Okay, someone kick Tora out of the chat room please.
4376220	4380220	Right the fuck now.
4380220	4384220	Thank you. Okay, the classic game is Final Fantasy
4384220	4388220	6, which we got over here on Super Nintendo as Final Fantasy 3.
4388220	4392220	Play the best music in the game ever please.
4392220	4396220	This is the overworld music, which is also called Terra's theme.
4396220	4402220	Although in the Japanese version her name was Tina.
4402220	4406220	Best music in the game. Sorry.
4406220	4410220	That's just my own opinion. And Sausa's best game ever.
4410220	4414220	I think this is probably one of the best video game songs ever.
4414220	4418220	This game is the reason why I skipped a week of high school.
4418220	4422220	While I had the flu. But that's beside the point.
4422220	4426220	My flu was prolonged. No, no. I started off having the flu and my grandma rented the game for me.
4426220	4430220	And I ended up just having the flu a little bit longer than I really did.
4430220	4434220	But the one thing about this one is it was the first in the series
4434220	4438220	that was not done by Sakaguchi. It was done by Yoshinori Kitase
4438220	4442220	and Hiroyuki Ito. And this is
4442220	4446220	considered pretty much the pinnacle of it. Although I really, really like Final Fantasy 5
4446220	4450220	a whole lot too. It has the largest
4450220	4454220	playable cast of any Final Fantasy game to date.
4454220	4458220	Pretty much it's standard Final Fantasy.
4458220	4462220	You have your overworld map and you have your dungeons and you have
4462220	4466220	your towns and you've got your chocobo
4466220	4470220	and you have your airship and random encounters on land.
4470220	4474220	This one also has your
4474220	4478220	espers which give you your magic and you keep improving.
4478220	4482220	And it's still menu based combat. I mean it's Final Fantasy
4482220	4486220	basically. There were a few different
4486220	4490220	innovative attacks. Like Selle's had the runic attack which could reflect
4490220	4494220	magical attacks back at somebody.
4494220	4498220	Although I'll be honest, I rarely ever freaking use that except for that one battle where you had to.
4498220	4502220	And I'm actually still playing this right now too.
4502220	4506220	But this has, for the active time
4506220	4510220	battle system, you actually can pick any character that has
4510220	4514220	filled up their action bar and you don't have to pick
4514220	4518220	the first one that pops up. You can actually change out which one you want to use as long
4518220	4522220	as their bar is their first.
4522220	4526220	And this actually was incorporated into later ones. You could customize
4526220	4530220	your characters by your relics to change their stats.
4530220	4534220	You could work with their spells a little bit. You could equip their
4534220	4538220	magicite which is like I was saying is basically some of the espers
4538220	4542220	helps with magic. They have the magic acquisition points for each time.
4542220	4546220	You gain APs. You level up. This particular game
4546220	4550220	is where basically you've got
4550220	4554220	this one girl named Terra in the Japanese version. It was
4554220	4558220	Tina. And they find her and she can do magic.
4558220	4562220	And everyone's like, Oh my god! Magic! I'm going to barf! And then the rest of the story
4562220	4566220	comes off. This also has Kefka which is the
4566220	4570220	most annoying laugh
4570220	4574220	in a video game ever.
4574220	4578220	Somebody poison the water hole!
4578220	4582220	But he had the best boss theme ever.
4582220	4586220	Actually I really like Jenova's better. But anyway.
4586220	4590220	The one other really cool thing that I thought about this game is that it's very
4590220	4594220	punk. Really it is. I mean you've got
4594220	4598220	steam powered mecha in the game. It's all very
4598220	4602220	early industrial. Magitek. You have your magitek armor.
4602220	4606220	You've got you know the empire in that is pretty much
4606220	4610220	a magical industrial type
4610220	4614220	mesh. I know it's so fantastic. And you have toilets in it. You can use the toilet. Did you know that?
4614220	4618220	What if you don't use the toilet? Because in Sims that's not good.
4618220	4622220	If you're in the empire castle or whatever
4622220	4626220	and you're in one of the cells you can actually sit on the toilet and squat down on it.
4626220	4630220	And then when you hop off the toilet it flushes.
4630220	4634220	Do they take down their little pants to do that?
4634220	4638220	No they have a trap door. They do? Okay.
4638220	4642220	Also Saw says it has the freakiest clown in a video game ever.
4642220	4646220	But you've got some of the best characters in this.
4646220	4650220	I actually really liked
4650220	4654220	GoGo. I really liked GoGo.
4654220	4658220	Because of the weird stuff he did. I loved Gal who was the
4658220	4662220	little feral boy. And Mog wasn't
4662220	4666220	you get Mog.
4666220	4670220	I don't know why we're having mic issues in studio.
4670220	4674220	Is it? Oh keep it away from interference. I'm sorry. But Rob do me a favor
4674220	4678220	Alright I'll try to find it.
4678220	4682220	This game had the single most hardcore awesome character in it.
4682220	4686220	Which was um. We'll get to him in a second.
4686220	4690220	But the main characters you have Terra slash Tina. You've got Locke who's your thief.
4690220	4694220	You have Sillies who's treasure hunter.
4694220	4698220	You have Sabin who's your martial artist.
4698220	4702220	This is a special rendition of it. Oh no wait. Here we go.
4702220	4706220	But here's the man.
4714220	4718220	Shadow the ninja. Who we used to call Snake Eyes.
4718220	4722220	And you have Realm was cool. She had the drawing
4722220	4726220	attack. And you had her grandfather who's the blue mage. And you had
4726220	4732220	what's-his-face who looked like Billy Dee Williams.
4732220	4736220	Who was the Doma castle guy.
4736220	4740220	But he looked like Billy Dee. Sorry he looks like Billy Dee Williams.
4740220	4744220	Edgar was the best. I bet he does. Edgar was awesome.
4744220	4748220	Because it was all about the autocrossbow.
4748220	4752220	And the chainsaw.
4752220	4756220	And the graphics actually were
4756220	4760220	the characters were designed by Yoshitaka Amano and they were
4760220	4764220	actually converted to sprite.
4764220	4768220	And there were also
4768220	4772220	in the Playstation version that came out later
4772220	4776220	the actual videos that were in the game
4776220	4780220	were directly from Amano's designs. That was pretty cool.
4780220	4784220	It was one of the, it's not the first one that used mode 7 but it used
4784220	4788220	extensive mode 7 in this for lots of
4788220	4792220	scaling and scrolling. It was really fantastic.
4792220	4796220	When it was localized there were changes
4796220	4800220	like a little bit of nudity. For
4800220	4804220	example. One of the painting bosses.
4804220	4808220	Yes one of those. Also
4808220	4812220	different characters for their full names. They romanized them differently
4812220	4816220	so that they would fix a six, fit a six character slot.
4816220	4820220	They were also changed quite a bit from Terra to Tina from
4820220	4824220	Mash to Sabin. From Kayen to Sion.
4824220	4828220	But I think that they
4828220	4832220	picked it in the way that people would most be able to
4832220	4836220	relate to it. Text, a lot of
4836220	4840220	dialogue was shortened. Because again
4840220	4844220	it could only store a certain number of characters
4844220	4848220	and I'm sorry Japanese lends itself a lot easier to extended conversation
4848220	4852220	within a limited character allotment because it's syllabic and
4852220	4856220	English isn't. This
4856220	4868220	is so awesome.
4868220	4872220	This is the opera scene which is
4872220	4876220	to this day I think one of the most memorable ever scenes
4876220	4880220	in any video game ever are.
4880220	4884220	It really is. Did you see
4884220	4888220	what they did for the Dear Friends concert
4888220	4892220	where they did the opera scene
4892220	4896220	in Japanese. I saw YouTube of it. It was just
4896220	4900220	fantastic. It was so beautiful. And here's actually
4900220	4904220	one that we should realize
4904220	4908220	about the music. We've kept bringing up the music during
4908220	4912220	this. It was actually done by Uematsu
4912220	4916220	who wrote all of the music in the game.
4916220	4920220	Did everything for every location, all the battles
4920220	4924220	different themes. They actually use the music
4924220	4928220	from the games in Japanese music classes in Japan.
4928220	4932220	Also they wanted to
4932220	4936220	use an actual voice for the opera but the SBC
4936220	4940220	700 chip would not allow an actual
4940220	4944220	voice track so that's why they used
4944220	4948220	the...well it would basically be
4948220	4952220	the Vox Organa or Vox Humana thing
4952220	4956220	for organ is what I recognized.
4956220	4960220	The sound chip itself didn't support the voices but later on
4960220	4964220	you had games like Tales of Fantasia and Star Ocean that did have
4964220	4968220	actual voice samples. But we're talking about full vocal track.
4968220	4972220	It wouldn't support a full vocal track. It would support
4972220	4976220	something that was short.
4976220	4980220	The last Metroid is in captivity.
4980220	4984220	The galaxy is at peace. It's about as much as you can get.
4984220	4988220	Or the clay fighters opening.
4988220	4992220	For the Final Fantasy 6 Grand Finale
4992220	4996220	album it actually was rearranged as an aria using
4996220	5000220	an actual singer in full
5000220	5004220	accompaniment and this version was also in the full motion
5004220	5008220	video in the Playstation version so it was pretty cool.
5008220	5012220	You can actually get...I've got the full soundtrack
5012220	5016220	to this. You can get all kinds of arranged versions but there's also
5016220	5020220	some pretty good versions of this
5020220	5024220	some of the music in the game and some of the Final Fantasy compilation
5024220	5028220	discs. Although I still think
5028220	5032220	that the best of the compilation ones, which I don't think has any from this game in it, is still
5032220	5036220	Celtic Moon and Prey was very good. Prey had some stuff in here.
5036220	5040220	We did, like I said, we got a Playstation version
5040220	5044220	but there's also Final Fantasy 6 Advance
5044220	5048220	which came out on DS. There's four new espers in this one which is
5048220	5052220	Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar and Diabolos.
5052220	5056220	I think it was on Game Boy Advance. Sorry, that's the Game Boy Advance one.
5056220	5060220	I wish it was on DS, that'd be awesome. Yeah, well that's the one I've been playing through until my
5060220	5064220	DS broke. Also
5064220	5068220	for this game, as of March 31, 2003
5068220	5072220	it shipped 3.48 million copies worldwide
5072220	5076220	which is 2.6 million in Japan alone and
5076220	5080220	860,000 overseas and continued to be one
5080220	5084220	of the best selling games of all time. Did you, in that week that you were home
5084220	5088220	with it, did you beat it in the week, did you play it like non-stop? No, I didn't actually.
5088220	5092220	You should have. I've had tons of other stuff to do. I'm in school, dude.
5092220	5096220	Anyway, another neat thing about this though
5096220	5100220	and this is what made me all hyper, is that when
5100220	5104220	I don't know if you remember when the Nintendo 64 was in
5104220	5108220	production, or sorry, when testing, they actually made
5108220	5112220	a demonstration for the Nintendo 64 using
5112220	5116220	the cast from Final Fantasy
5116220	5120220	7 in a big battle, I think versus Bahamut
5120220	5124220	which I found video of finally and it's freaking crazy looking.
5124220	5128220	Which is what we're looking at right now in studio. It was gonna be too expensive, right, to put
5128220	5132220	on a cartridge to do the game, right, for Final Fantasy 7?
5132220	5136220	Well, basically it was actually done on Silicon Graphics hardware
5136220	5140220	when they first put it out, but Square hadn't yet committed
5140220	5144220	and the technology in the game was
5144220	5148220	not up to their parts. They actually wanted to move it to PlayStation for the sake of full motion video.
5148220	5152220	Which the PlayStation, of course, could easily handle.
5152220	5156220	But the demo actually had
5156220	5160220	Terra, Locke, and Shadow.
5160220	5164220	And it was controlled actually through using a mouse
5164220	5168220	instead of, you know, actual, like with a control.
5168220	5172220	There was also Final Fantasy 6, the interactive CG game
5172220	5176220	which was actually also called Final Fantasy X.
5176220	5180220	Not a Final Fantasy X, Final Fantasy X.
5180220	5184220	Which was the same demonstration, but with
5184220	5188220	better touch-ups, textures.
5188220	5192220	Oh no, this was basically...
5192220	5196220	But this was basically what they were using.
5196220	5200220	It was a sort of
5200220	5204220	touchdown version that they were using for the Nintendo 64
5204220	5208220	demo test, but this was more
5208220	5212220	to demonstrate the actual use of CG in the
5212220	5216220	thing, so that's pretty cool.
5216220	5220220	So that's our classic game is Final Fantasy 6.
5220220	5224220	Oh good, because I was running out of music. That was long. That's alright. It's worth it.
5224220	5228220	That game deserves it. I knew that this game would require a ton of
5228220	5232220	attention, so
5232220	5236220	how could we not dedicate more time to it? And it's Episode 300.
5236220	5240220	I mean, hell, we have to pick the pinnacle. Alright. I don't know how you're going to follow that
5240220	5244220	next week. Alright. Because it's not better than Super Metroid.
5244220	5248220	Whatever. You know what? Honestly, you know, I actually like
5248220	5252220	Final Fantasy 6 even more so than I do Chrono Trigger, so if any game you're going to say competes
5252220	5256220	for the best game of all time next to Super Metroid, I could see Final Fantasy 6.
5256220	5260220	I would actually say Final Fantasy 6 is overall...
5260220	5264220	Now, I used to say I really liked Final Fantasy 5
5264220	5268220	a whole lot, and I'll probably do that as a later game, because
5268220	5272220	of how customizable the job change system was, and Final Fantasy 3 was the
5272220	5276220	first one to do that of the Japanese releases, which was actually
5276220	5280220	really fun, too. If anyone can find a translation of it, play it. It's fantastic.
5280220	5284220	Well, they've got it on DS. They have it now, but I mean, like, the old one.
5284220	5288220	But Final Fantasy 6, I think, for storytelling,
5288220	5292220	for just how drawn in it brings you into everything, for
5292220	5296220	all the detail, and I mean, flushing toilets, a first for any Final Fantasy
5296220	5300220	game. I mean, but with the opera, by the time you get to the opera, there's
5300220	5304220	like this epic, crazy stuff, and so much has gone on already, and
5304220	5308220	you just, you're like, oh my god, this is some crazy adventure.
5308220	5312220	Plus, it's all about the
5312220	5316220	X-Zone. And the Vanish
5316220	5320220	Doom. No, it was...
5320220	5324220	X-Zone was the one I used, but it was all about that.
5324220	5328220	Alright, we're gonna wrap up, or we're gonna have no time for Skype calls in Part B. We're gonna
5328220	5332220	move on and take a break, but hey, don't go away. There'll be plenty more of Orange Launch Radio.
5332220	5336220	Some more news coming in Part B. We've got a new technology Microsoft might be
5336220	5340220	building so that people will stop swearing on Xbox Live. I can't wait to see what people
5340220	5344220	have to say about this. Yeah, I know. Aw, fuck. Alright. So anyway,
5344220	5348220	we'll be talking about that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5348220	5352220	And for those of you guys
5352220	5356220	listening live tonight, we have, for tonight's free break, your shout outs
5356220	5360220	from our voicemail. So enjoy. We'll be back in a few minutes with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5360220	5364220	Music
5364220	5368220	Music
5368220	5372220	Hey all our crew, happy 300k. Here's the turnaround of all our
5372220	5376220	legendary DSX-B8. Yes, this voicemail is about the
5376220	5380220	value of the all our tech, or the never-ending trans class in DMN case.
5380220	5384220	Hey, hey, hey! What's up? Dan Chateau here.
5384220	5388220	So, 300. Episode
5388220	5392220	300. Wow. 300. Really?
5392220	5396220	I can't even get one. Can't get one?
5396220	5400220	Just one. Really? No.
5400220	5404220	300. Wow, man. Cool.
5404220	5408220	Yeah. 300. Sure.
5408220	5412220	Okay. Bye. Okay. Hi, it's
5412220	5416220	Goldampero. I haven't really left a message to
5416220	5420220	talk to you guys for a while, but I'm, and even though I'm probably
5420220	5424220	going to be there, I'm probably not going to be there just because of the stupid school reasons.
5424220	5428220	So, hope you guys, your 300 episode is really good and I'll
5428220	5432220	send it on the podcast. Anyway, real quickly, I want to tell my game
5432220	5436220	spot so I can stop the story. Basically, there's one for the whiteboard.
5436220	5440220	I went once with my mom a couple months ago,
5440220	5444220	and what happened was, well,
5444220	5448220	I got sent. We were waiting in line,
5448220	5452220	and the lady was, we had to wait 10 minutes, they were
5452220	5456220	ignoring us, and we were at the front of the line at the counter,
5456220	5460220	and then they had the nerve to ask,
5460220	5464220	the nerve to ask, do you want to buy an edge cart with that, because you're 10% discount?
5464220	5468220	My mom was like, no, and then we walked out. I mean,
5468220	5472220	after making us wait 10 minutes, we could tell they were pretty much a little bit
5472220	5476220	ignoring us, and you know, I know it's a bit busy, but
5476220	5480220	I mean, it's just so annoying.
5480220	5484220	So there's one for the game spot, stop, whatever
5484220	5488220	message board thing. Sorry it was a little over a minute. Later.
5488220	5492220	What's up, Orange Mouse Radio? This is Tigerclaw. I'd like to congratulate
5492220	5496220	you all for the 300th episode. Keep up the good fight.
5496220	5500220	Take care. Alright? Well, happy 300th!
5500220	5504220	Or as we say in French,
5504220	5508220	30, 30! Oh well, hell. Anyway,
5508220	5512220	hi there, O.L.R., this is SakiRipper just calling you to say
5512220	5516220	happy 300!
5516220	5520220	300 after the arms jargon. That was Swedish.
5520220	5524220	So, oh well, hell. You're us at a later date.
5524220	5529020	Hello there, Orange Mouse Radio, this is DMN, co-host of Under
5529020	5533020	Shadow, and host of the old DMN Sanity. Yee-haw!
5533020	5537020	Anyways, I'm calling to congratulate you guys on 300 episodes.
5537020	5541020	That is a fantastic match. You guys are amazing.

5545020	5549020	listening is, so congratulations once again on 300, and
5549020	5553020	don't rob for too much, kids. Anyways, take care.

5559020	5563020	your favorite neighborhood Mexican, and I want to
5563020	5567020	congratulate Orange Mouse Radio for their 300th episode, so
5567020	5571020	congrats, and keep up the good fight.
5571020	5583020	So, basically that, congratulations.
5583020	5589020	300! 300! 300! 300!
5589020	5593020	Excuse me, is it Rob? Hey, it's Misty.
5593020	5597020	What? You know I was going to call you.
5597020	5601020	Congrats on episode 300. You know, I heart you.
5601020	5605020	I'll heart you guys forever. Bye.
5605020	5609020	Hey, Orange is on Under Radio, it's CJ Tyrant. Just wanted to say congrats on

5621020	5625020	Off the hat, you. Anyways, congratulations.
5625020	5629020	300 episodes so far, looking forward to the next 300.
5629020	5633020	Have a good week, guys.

5637020	5641020	of OLR, so I will not be listening live tonight.
5641020	5645020	I'm going to set out to actually play DDR in a few minutes, so I will
5645020	5649020	try for today for a special AAA for you guys, so
5649020	5653020	hopefully we look into a couple hundred more OLR episodes
5653020	5657020	in the next couple of years before. And I'm going to be heading out, so peace out.
5657020	5661020	And AAA for these jammer games. Hey guys, if you're listening to your listeners,
5661020	5665020	CJ Tyrant, and I'm calling to tell you that Orange is on Under Radio is the A show
5665020	5669020	when it comes to gaming projects. And I really don't understand how much this show does mean to us
5669020	5673020	fans. 300 episodes, guys. Congratulations. Looking forward to more
5673020	5683020	A show in 2009.
5683020	5687020	Hey. Hey. What?
5687020	5691020	Did you like, um, did you upload
5691020	5695020	the thing yet? I'm working on it right now, but before I get to
5695020	5699020	upload it, there's one thing we gotta do first. What? We have to
5699020	5703020	wish Orange is On's radio a happy 300. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely.
5703020	5707020	So let's get it going. I'm DJ Ronn S. And I'm Kudo Osagie.
5707020	5707020	And on behalf of the staff at Anime Jam

5715020	5719020	Jamie, and Loke, on an awesome 300 episode tonight.
5719020	5723020	Oh my gosh, 300 episodes. What are you guys going to do now? Like go to Disney World?
5723020	5727020	I hope not. They've already done Disney World. I know, it's so
5727020	5733020	I know but um tonight, I'm gonna I'm gonna listen. I'm gonna have a drink based on each one of them
5733020	5739000	So these are awesome funds tonight. You're gonna like totally plastered. I feel bad for you. I'm not gonna be fast
5739000	5741000	Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are
5743400	5746780	Hey, what instead of arguing won't you come into the chat room tonight?
5746780	5752060	Oh, it'll be fun
5752060	5758960	So, um, Rob Matt Jamie have a great show tonight and you know, I'll be there and see you for episode real one
5760160	5762160	Hey, so we're excited
5763760	5765760	Just a little bit
5765760	5792080	All right, awesome. Have a good show tonight. See you laters
5792080	5798020	Welcome back everybody to episode number 300 of orange lounge radio in this Sunday evening, October the 26th
5798440	5801400	2008 just a reminder. There will be no show next week
5801400	5802980	I'm just due to the fact that hey
5802980	5809480	We deserve a week off after 300 episodes and the fact that I'm having surgery and I'm being held up by Loki
5809600	5816080	Dressed as sack boy, which you can see on our Justin TV feed at Justin TV slash orange lounge radio
5816080	5823040	Right now he's holding up tipped gunny. Oh, he's holding up the Justin listeners with a gun. That's that's lovely. Where'd you get a gun?
5827000	5832640	Okay, I'm like where the hell who got you a gun Rob I have airsoft guns, all right
5834320	5836320	Pistols, all right
5836320	5840560	Anyhow, I know we want to get to the skype line. We got a lot of people want to call in tonight
5840560	5842200	We're gonna try as many calls as possible
5842200	5846920	But first we got a little more news to get to and Loki you ready and situated there ready to get us back into some
5846920	5850000	Gaming news. Yeah, of course. All righty. All right, so
5850640	5858800	Starting things off as I kind of hinted to earlier pin aircade adventures episode 2 is coming to Xbox Live Arcade and PC
5859680	5860880	on
5860880	5862720	October 29th
5862720	5865960	That's awesome news. No word on ps3 yet
5866240	5871200	Probably just because they just finally got the first episode so give it a little bit more time
5871200	5873800	but it will be $15 on both platforms and
5875280	5880360	Will be all sorts of awesome. So sweet. It better be based on that recommendation
5881080	5886040	Well, it's supposed to be the first one was kind of fun. So we don't see why the second one would be as well
5886400	5890080	Well one thing you might not be getting to do when you play this game online
5890080	5895360	Even though you don't really play this game online, but other Xbox Live games would be you probably won't get to swear much longer
5895360	5902880	Apparently the US patent office has granted a patent to Microsoft for real-time censoring of audio streams
5903160	5906240	So, you know, this is pretty self-explanatory
5906600	5912480	Probably what Microsoft wants as far as they want to be able to censor what Xbox Live is probably most known for
5913040	5918080	Is the fuck fuck fuck fuck, you know and all that stuff that you hear when you go on Xbox Live, by the way
5918080	5920080	They can't censor this show. Haha
5920080	5922080	Fuck fuck fuck fuck
5924080	5926080	You know what though
5926200	5930680	You know what a writer on Ars Technica though Jonathan Gitlin though
5931080	5935720	Brings up a really kind of scary point think about this because you know, this is the technology, right?
5935720	5939120	I can also envisage a much sinister role
5939120	5945400	However, imagine the same system applied to digital telephony then think how valuable such a system might be to an authoritarian
5946160	5947320	authoritarian regime
5947320	5950840	As we've seen to good effect in Burma and elsewhere the ubiquity of cell phones
5950840	5953840	It's been a good thing for dissidents who need to get their message out or organize themselves
5954040	5958520	The Great Firewall of China already blocks objectionable web content from reaching Chinese computers
5958520	5964320	What's to stop cell phones from censoring anti-government conversations, too? That is kind of a scary thought
5964320	5967440	Let's hope that this isn't used for you know, anything
5968400	5970400	Pushing the limits I can imagine this is
5971120	5975800	Gonna be a scary thing if it falls into the wrong hands. So Janai brings up an interesting point
5975800	5978960	What's that in chat? Imagine censoring the angry video game nerd?
5980520	5985960	Well, yeah still just anything it's a it kind of threatens free speech. His powers are beyond Microsoft's comprehension
5985960	5990960	If indeed if in the wrong hands, I you know again in this country, you know, since free speech is in our Constitution
5990960	5993920	I don't think it's gonna be a big problem. But you know, it could be interesting to see the effect
5993920	5995800	This could have another place. I think the guy makes a good point
5995800	6000360	What if it falls in the wrong hands, but also I can't imagine that this is going to be
6000360	6006120	That accurate, you know what I mean? That'd be ways. Will it catch me if I say frack?
6006280	6013280	The thing is with what if I'm talking about my shih tzu dog, am I gonna get censored thing is Rob about free speech rights
6014400	6017400	Yeah, the government can't inhibit your free speech rights
6017400	6024120	But companies sure can when you agree to play by their rules exactly as long as you've signed the agreement saying that you're going to use
6024160	6025840	their
6025840	6027840	proprietary, you know
6027840	6032120	Software and I guess the hardware to since it's referring to the Xbox
6032280	6036640	Then they do have a right to censor any content that comes through their own
6037240	6039240	equipment it's just like a
6039960	6041120	private
6041120	6047680	Organization denying people the use of their facilities exactly. All right, I get that I get that but still I'm gonna be very disappointed
6047680	6050180	Since I pay for Microsoft service if I can't say fuck
6050480	6056560	However, knowing Microsoft and based on track history only I'm going to assume it'll probably be a switch little
6056560	6059520	You know help keep it safe for kids, which I'm cool with, you know
6059520	6063800	If parents want to turn it on but they shouldn't rely on it. That's the other dangerous thing
6063800	6067640	I don't want parents to rely on it to see it like, you know, some of those TBS
6068320	6070320	comedies where they replace it with like
6070960	6074760	Stupid words just like ordinary thing like what a fruit
6075760	6077760	French toast
6078040	6080180	Shove it up your bologna. Yes, like
6080180	6088380	Well or kazoo or be perfectly honest the whole reason that swear words are considered swear words in the beginning is
6088380	6092820	Because people have given them the power to offend and what is it that I have been saying?
6093300	6097060	For a very long time now you find this show very offensive
6097060	6102000	Oh, whatever learn to be offended the less of a big deal you make out of it
6102780	6104780	The less it's gonna matter. I mean really
6104780	6110660	The whole reason that I think you know little kids think it's fun to go out and cuss from their little kids is because their
6110660	6115820	Parents say oh, that's bad. You shouldn't do it the less you're allowed to do something the more y'all want to do it
6116620	6120500	Exactly it people do that because people do that because it raises eyebrows
6121060	6122740	Well, look folks
6122740	6128860	No one gets offended. Why would they want to do it anymore? I would love to see Microsoft's and giggles
6128860	6147180	Well, that's why I would love to see Microsoft just try and censor this next segment of ours
6147180	6149180	The FUs of the week
6149500	6154160	Fuck you with something hard and sandpaper II
6154160	6167360	to a certain closed-minded tight-assed bigoted conservatives that have been
6170080	6175440	Less than polite in regards to how they decide to phrase their personal points of view and
6176920	6182320	F you to other things that are personal. All right
6182320	6186760	Oh go and F you to my hair
6187360	6191400	Loki F you the sack boy for being so fluffy cuz
6191960	6198000	Fluffy equals hot you're kind of you're kind of fluffy Loki. I am couple that's why I didn't have to pad the front
6199000	6203040	Yeah, no needing the pad myself. Well that and it's really friggin hot
6203040	6208120	But actually luckily the sweatshirt is quite thin so it's not too bad
6208120	6213440	I actually have like jeans under the pants and another t-shirt under this shirt
6213960	6215840	so
6215840	6219800	All right, but the heads really fucking hot can't can't do anything with the head my turn
6219920	6225180	Yes, yay. I want to say F you to the people that decided to call me faggot yesterday
6225180	6229680	Well, I was out protesting prop 8 we were out there on the streets holding signs
6229800	6233060	You know, I had a big thing said, you know protect civil rights and all stuff
6233060	6239680	there was a group of us out there and some guy as he drove by decided to yell faggots and throw candy corn at us cuz
6239680	6244680	That's that's the world. We live in folks. No, I don't know whether to be angry or happy that no
6244680	6249600	It's like it's like and one hand I'm offended by what you said in the other hand candy corn
6250360	6255120	Not when they've fallen on the dirty-ass Street. I'm not oh, that's just not except that is I guess
6255160	6260540	So not only did he say faggot Loki. He wasted candy corn and if you don't know
6260540	6262300	You don't waste time. I'm sorry
6262300	6269660	Is is it wrong for me to mention that we're supposed to learn to stop throwing things and having food fight
6269660	6271660	Yeah, when we're in kindergarten
6272380	6276820	Yeah, and then oh, yeah, and then the lady as she was coming out of the drive-thru
6276820	6281020	No, here's the best one the lady coming out the drive-thru faggots. You're all going to hell
6281580	6285580	That's what she yelled at us. They should have thrown skittles. No, you know what I said, I yelled back
6285580	6291580	I said God loves a bigot too. That's what I said back to her. Then she drove off pissed off good. So
6292540	6296580	You know and so don't sit there and tell me this proposition isn't about hate and discrimination
6296740	6300940	Cuz I'll tell you what I've seen it right in the face and it is so yeah. All right
6301940	6305060	Moving on some real quick F use from our guests because we have a lot in studio
6305060	6308300	We'll start with Drew since he has a mic. All right F you to my student government for
6309260	6313900	being assholes about the whole proposition thing agreed, I didn't vote him in and
6313900	6320940	They're trying to speak for the entire student body and I don't like it one bit actually I did to go with this
6320940	6325900	I might have mentioned this earlier. There was a girl who was driving in front of me leaving school
6325900	6333380	We forget the same school and she wrote on her car. No to prop eight. The ARC Student Council does not represent me. I
6334460	6335860	approve of that
6335860	6337060	but
6337060	6344300	Also F you to people who are taking the zombie event in while a little too far and taking the hordes and hordes of zombies
6344780	6351180	People taking Wow too far to the low B zones and killing all the low B's are trying to start out
6351700	6359500	That's not cool. I mean, yeah, it's zombies and it's brains, but it's not cool. Don't be a dick
6360460	6363480	All right, pick up boy. Do you have any F use of the week?
6363480	6366800	I'm gonna send a nephew toward
6367560	6372960	the bimbo of politicians everywhere and I don't even think I need to you know,
6373560	6376560	Go any further with that because everybody should know who I'm talking about
6377200	6379480	But so I shall pass the mic on
6380240	6384560	Arcadian 42 fuck you to 65-hour work weeks. They suck
6385800	6387600	put me behind like
6387600	6391840	Way way behind on everything. But oh well give me money
6391840	6399120	Good money is good. Doctor. Fuck you to expert on DDR because I look like a douche trying to do it nice
6399520	6404100	And lastly Mel Chan anything you want to say free no fuck use for Mel Chan. All right
6407280	6414600	All right, that's it for the F use of the week dark Sakura take us back to some gaming news and stuff happened the end
6415360	6417360	Okay, it'd be soft
6417360	6421720	as actually working on the latest I know game and
6423160	6426160	Actually have had to push it back a little bit
6426880	6432320	As well as one that they have literally called an as yet unannounced
6433240	6437280	Franchise they were gonna release it to the 2008-2009
6438120	6444520	Fiscal year, but it's actually going to be oh nine ten. We don't know what this is. But I know I'm 1404 is
6445320	6446960	a
6446960	6448880	settlement building game
6448880	6450880	This speaks for itself
6451280	6454960	There's there's a trailer around if someone wants to look at game trailers. I'm sure there's one there
6455480	6461360	But the other one they're not saying what it is, but they said that it's an unannounced one. So
6462280	6464280	Maybe it's a brand new franchise
6464920	6466920	could be
6466960	6468160	Hmm
6468160	6469920	well
6469920	6475720	Something unfortunately hasn't been delayed is an update to the Wii firmware. That's now
6475720	6479120	disabling the homebrew channel from being installed
6479720	6481720	other possible
6481720	6484040	problems faced with that are some
6484720	6486840	homebrew programs not running also
6488120	6489680	the
6489680	6496240	video player that they had that also allowed you to watch DVDs is not working as well the end player and
6498240	6503280	Right now though if you do have the homebrew channel installed you're fine, but you won't be able to install it if you
6503280	6505280	You know do
6505800	6507800	3.3 also in Japan
6508520	6515840	They have the shop channel down right now for maintenance as they're changing all the references to Wii points to Nintendo points and other
6516640	6522760	Pre-dsi maintenance is that a little deceiving though because the points aren't going to be interchangeable that strikes me as kind of dumb it is
6523240	6525240	deceiving yes
6525960	6527960	And then also apparently right now
6527960	6533360	If you don't update your system you will not be able to access the shop channel
6533480	6538480	Which is ironic because if you think about it if they're not able to access the shop channel
6538480	6541000	They won't buy your crap that you're selling online
6541000	6545480	And you know with the homebrew stuff that it is easy to I don't know
6546200	6548760	Pirate said games that you're offering on the service
6548760	6554000	I would think that you would want to allow people to be able to purchase your games and let them have fun with the homebrew
6554000	6555800	stuff since
6555800	6557600	likely
6557600	6564800	Situation is is that they're actually not pirating games using that they're just you know playing with these home brew people
6565280	6567280	jobs I
6567320	6571080	Don't think they need jobs. It's just if there's something offered to them for free
6571160	6575840	They're gonna take the free route then rather than pay for a game that might be crap and unfortunately
6575840	6578160	There's a lot of might be crap games on the Wii
6578160	6584800	Um kloutipo in chat says so do the people who have to try and close all these homebrew exploits
6584800	6590080	Just completely and utterly hate their jobs. I see so no way someone could take pleasure from that well
6590080	6596720	I I can see the other side though. You know people stealing other people's work by pirating such games
6597280	6602240	Don't lie. This is what a lot of the quote-unquote homebrew people do I can see both sides of it, though?
6602240	6608560	All right well um I guess maybe I should hurry up and install that before my Wii updates itself because I haven't updated it yet
6608560	6610240	So maybe I should get that homebrew channel on there
6610240	6615320	I don't know is it is it gonna screw me over later if I put it on there now no you can always delete it
6615320	6620200	It's not like you're gonna buy anything on the Wii shop channel Rob. Well. I don't know this this might do the trick
6620200	6626440	It's something new that was announced this week. It's Mart racer. Do you remember the old-school game show supermarket sweep?
6626440	6631640	Dude, that's this the greatest ever that's this look. There's a little trailer here. We're playing in studio
6633400	6635400	It's yeah
6636680	6641400	Lifetime lawnmowers unpacked, but look at this you actually run around a supermarket with your cart
6642200	6647000	And you but you pick up plungers for some weird reason, but if you run into other shoppers
6647720	6651000	But yeah like it's everything you've always wanted to do in the supermarket
6651000	6656760	They're all kind of crazy out of eight characters, so there you have it. It's like it's gonna rock suit meets
6657480	6664040	Jet-set radio or something like that by the way according to Juan grill who is the studio manager for the developers Joju games?
6664280	6667160	He says that Mart racer was inspired from the shape of the wiimote
6667160	6670080	He says quote the first time I grabbed a wiimote instinctively
6670080	6674720	I grabbed it with both hands like a bar that made me start thinking on a game where you can maneuver it like you would
6674720	6652000	Be grabbing a
6652000	6680480	So that is how we came to the game as a Mat
6680480	6683720	would be grabbing a bar so there you go and if you want to play with a classic
6683720	6687460	controller you can but I guess it's probably more fun with motion controls
6687460	6690860	because you can imagine that you're pushing that cart just like a bat out of
6690860	6695700	hell up and down the aisles of Safeway it'll be lots of fun you know I wonder
6695700	6699340	because people are always afraid about you know real life taking after video
6699340	6702920	games I wonder if this is gonna cause an epidemic of like you know people running
6702920	6707300	around supermarkets like crazy let's go on a milkshake run as if this milkshake
6707300	6711260	as if this game get more stuff for milkshakes as if this game will sell that
6711260	6714640	many copies although I don't know it sounds pretty awesome to me I might
6714640	6718000	actually I might break my protest just for Mart racer because it looks that
6718000	6723440	awesome anyhow what are some other things you can download our sagra well
6723440	6731480	there is a few games coming out on we were in the UK there are there's the
6731480	6738240	incredible maze which is a 500 we points and it's different it's mazes and has
6738240	6743320	balance board support so you actually steer a ball around the maze and dodge
6743320	6746960	traps basically it's marble madness with the balance board from what I understand
6746960	6752240	there's also interior design and well an interior design game sorry called home
6752240	6761200	sweet home that is you basically take rooms and redesign them sort of like a
6761200	6766200	bizarre puzzle and it's a thousand we points and then there's Tetris party
6766200	6772280	which is 1200 we points that is minigame Tetris using the balance board and it
6772280	6777200	has online multiplayer for up to six people yeah but how many times have I
6777200	6786760	played Tetris really what just remember the epic battle with Christopher thank
6786760	6791840	you kept yelling at us again for Tetris on the DS Oh God he was a scary
6791840	6796640	motherfucker on Tetris on the DS I remember that that was some scary stuff
6796640	6806080	yeah thanks for the memories alright anyhow I'm sorry yes so other than stuff
6806080	6810720	coming on to the WiiWare service there's some interesting stuff if you happen to
6810720	6818440	own a Super Nintendo system apparently a German programmer took upon himself to
6818440	6823960	create a new console game that supports eight players his creation is a brawler
6823960	6830960	called n warp die sukent or it looks like a yeah die sakusen and allows you
6830960	6837600	to plug in two multi taps in the one and our SNES and yeah it's pretty awesome
6837600	6842640	but you can also if you don't want to I don't know say find a cart for it since
6842640	6845440	it doesn't look like there is an actual cart you can play it through an emulator
6845440	6853320	but I don't know that's pretty awesome eight player brawler game for Super
6853320	6857600	Nintendo if you want to download it the website is gra dot d force three
6857600	6865200	thousand dot de so that's where you can get that wonderful game all right well
6865200	6869240	for those of you looking forward to new Nintendo products Animal Crossing city

6906240	6911720	levels like they did in the GameCube you have stone bridges in the game over the

7549280	7559640	season once fallout 3 comes out I'm gonna hibernate peace I don't know I've
7559640	7561920	already gotten most of the games I'm looking forward to I guess the only
7561920	7565800	thing I've left is resistance to resistance to is a good one now do you
7565800	7572560	have anyone you're looking for do anyone else left for dead yeah I want zombie
7572560	7581160	action to speak into the microphone which one wait what I miss last remnant
7581160	7584000	what game are you looking forward to that hasn't come out yet that you don't
7584000	7590960	already have a little big planet yeah fallout 3 hopefully this week yeah I
7590960	7593560	want to play a lot of little big planet while I'm recovering from surgery that's
7593560	7601200	the plan it'll be fun to play while you're on drugs yes that's I'm sorry
7601200	7604920	I'm also looking forward to last remnant though even though I was not a fan of
7604920	7609760	infinite undiscovery I thought that I thought that it does the beginning was
7609760	7614080	awful like it didn't want me I didn't want to play it past the first hour in
7614080	7618400	comparison to blue dragon even blue dragon I played for at least like the
7618400	7623920	first disc but the best was lost Odyssey by waste of time I swear lost us he was
7623920	7627640	the best by far that's that's it for email though all right mailbag orange
7627640	7631920	launch radio.com if you want to send us an email for a future week meanwhile
7631920	7640800	more news Loki yes anyways so of course we know about the new game coming out
7640800	7647520	halo recon or halo 3 recon apparently though bungees halo team is moving on to
7647520	7654560	other things once this is done so I don't know maybe another game from bungee
7654560	7663040	that's say not halo maybe a I don't know marathon game something like that a low
7663040	7670840	may low marathon oh haven't they said this before like oh we swear we're not
7670840	7675520	doing this before like after halo 3 but you know it says basically they were
7675520	7679680	saying that they want to work on different territory and they said but I
7679680	7684160	think when this project wraps up in a couple months that it will be time for
7684160	7689200	when the team moves on to something else and part of the team will move on
7689200	7691800	something else and part of them will probably be absorbed into one of the
7691800	7695880	other projects that are already on the way I like what a deep man suggests in
7695880	7706080	the chat room a game called j-lo get it tips it say you know we need forget it
7706080	7710840	hey you know how the PlayStation 3 has trophies well according to the u.s.
7710840	7714560	official PlayStation magazine Sony might actually be giving out more than just
7714560	7717240	trophies pretty soon it's a little quote from the magazine that people were
7717240	7721240	reading way too much into it says quote we've heard that SCA is mulling over
7721240	7725080	some sort of trophy reward system we doubt it'll be cash to the equivalent
7725080	7728720	but we suspect it might be exclusive access to early betas and the like so
7728720	7733280	you know trophies are like PlayStation 3's version of 360s achievements
7733280	7737400	wouldn't that be interesting if suddenly you could use your trophies to now get
7737400	7741000	into betas and stuff I think Microsoft should do the same thing because I play
7741000	7746040	a lot more Microsoft games and well you know and and I agree with the people that
7746040	7750840	wrote this story on the net I got no problem if it's early demos or what have
7750840	7755120	you but just to give exclusive that seems kind of wrong to me just
7755120	7758480	encourages people to do nothing but play games all day but then again this whole
7758480	7762440	thing whole world is something retarded what is your what here's the words doing
7762440	7766320	you know where for example if you have different achievements and Gears of War
7766320	7771280	that you get shit for Gears of War 2 could it be something like that that
7771280	7774720	makes you know I beat you know a little big planet when little big planet 2
7774720	7780320	comes out or something like that I get some stupid costume or something that
7780320	7785600	works that works yeah all right well we'll see what happens maybe more to
7785600	7794880	come from Sony probably in 2009 I doubt that Sony's gonna explode the end it
7794880	7798600	already exploded it puked out something called Star Wars galaxies black wolf
7798600	7802000	has a good point I got to read this in chat okay sky what's better giving
7802000	7805560	exclusive betas to people who have lots of trophies or giving exclusive betas to
7805560	7810720	people who buy core I'll take option three giving exclusive betas to me here
7810720	7816200	that's the best of me anyway in other words the fanboys will never be happy
7816200	7827400	well there is a a boy named Brandon crisp 50 15 years old who went missing
7827400	7835560	after his parents confiscated his Xbox there is a Microsoft Canada is adding
7835560	7842000	$25,000 to the reward information that will you know hopefully lead to his safe
7842000	7845480	return so they're basically doubling the amount that's already out they're
7845480	7852440	working with the Barrie Ontario authorities looking for IP addresses of
7852440	7856360	anyone who had come into contact with him through Call of Duty 4 which was his
7856360	7864160	favorite game and Microsoft is really really putting forward a lot of effort
7864160	7874280	into trying to get this kid back so basically the oh god I hate this person
7874280	7880960	how is it Microsoft's problem he who shall not be named has involved himself
7880960	7890920	what the fuck I thought he was gone let me finish making an offer to the to help
7890920	7896040	the cops try to find it and and making up some crap about a video game
7896040	7899760	addiction or whatever the fuck he's on
7899760	7905720	I'm so disgusted with him what the fuck so now they got this bar he's gonna what
7905720	7909520	go become a Canadian lawyer or something is that what he's trying to do god damn
7909520	7912160	it the people that are supposed to threaten to move to Canada are the
7912160	7916280	Liberals that are afraid that you know it's like push gets reelected just I
7916280	7919960	just go play hide and go fuck yourself already you're already so this party
7919960	7925120	can't read Shakespeare go get out of here I'm just completely disgusted I
7925120	7930640	can't even call him a human being anymore really it's he's just a part
7930640	7938080	I think he's a part at any rate for anyone who might have some information
7938080	7944200	on his whereabouts call the Berry police at seven oh five seven two five seven
7944200	7952760	zero two five I hope that someone can find this kid I just hope that you know
7952760	7959520	he's okay so stop being an asshole and get out there and look someone needs to
7959520	7964160	find it before Jack does oh my god because if he finds him we'll never hear
7964160	7971240	the end of it Wow look at all the good I do I'm just disgusted I really am
7971240	7979360	horrified you know who does he think he is he's I mean he seriously is called
7979360	7985400	cause so much harm to so many people and he can't stop he's already being
7985400	7989560	punished for it and asshole hasn't learned his lesson yet I mean seriously
7989560	7992480	the only thing that's gonna stop this guy is to lock him up in a padded room
7992480	7999440	and have him yell his insults to the wall that does not care the end let's
7999440	8003840	just hope the wall doesn't have a blog the wall fucking bitch laps him okay I'm

8104040	8107120	been now that I mean originally it was supposed to like January since I've been
8107120	8111120	now they're trying to time it with the release of the movie so probably around
8111120	8115020	the time that the crappy movie comes out so yeah winner does not mean necessarily
8115020	8118380	this year winner is also January in February winner December through
8118380	8122720	February now the movie itself is being released in that time period where all
8122720	8127600	the stinker movies are released which is like a couple weeks after Valentine's
8127600	8131720	Day but kind of far away from Memorial Day yeah February 27th is when the
8131720	8134940	Street Fighter movie is supposed to come out so they assume that Street Fighter

8213200	8217240	they're smaller now but there's like there's like more enemies so it's more
8217240	8221440	difficult and like you'll usually be so busy funny anyways that you'll hardly
8221440	8225160	notice that the amount of small especially cuz like for this game I
8225160	8229920	don't use I hardly use the map like I usually have the second screen for like
8229920	8237840	checking enemies and stuff hmm do we have any really bad beat movie dialogue
8237840	8243720	in the game um yeah the English voice acting kind of sucks and there's a
8243720	8248360	Japanese language option but for me doesn't make it any better always make
8248360	8255000	it into a language that I'm not very fluent in yet hmm all right well do you
8255000	8260400	recommend it to fans of Castlevania yeah I've been that doesn't sound like a very
8260400	8267880	solid yes kind of like a yeah I guess I mean you have nothing better to do I
8267880	8272160	guess you could do it and if it if you're looking for a game that's like
8272160	8277040	more action oriented and like exploration oriented and this is a
8277040	8283160	pretty good game to try out all right sounds good anything else you want to

8495520	8500840	radio who's this hello there orange lounge this is a character hello my
8500840	8508240	friend how are you I'm doing just fine I'm well what I call well I was quite
8508240	8516960	surprised that at last the downloadable pack this week for rock band in in the
8516960	8522520	sense that it was a few sushi and banshee songs we're really the we're
8522520	8528760	really like my we my best best news of the week actually yes I know I'm very
8528760	8533040	excited about that just it's nice to see a nice eclectic mix of music and rock
8533040	8541960	band my problem is though that that all of the three songs that are there that
8541960	8549160	are there only one of them is good actually yeah they are to be picky
8549160	8552600	there's no peek-a-boo or anything which would be rad but I can't imagine
8552600	8556840	actually playing that song in rock band that's the thing yeah well babe but that
8556840	8560840	and that you mentioning peek-a-boo is like in one way if you know if you know
8560840	8565400	the history behind that song you know that it will be quite hard in one way
8565400	8573320	since the whole song is played backwards so it's right since they have to learn
8573320	8577880	how to play it all back what would be a fun challenge mode though there's notes
8577880	8584600	can scroll the opposite way well it'll be fun yeah what else is going on your
8584600	8592760	gaming world this week not much actually not much at all I'm it's a bit it's
8592760	8597920	really a sad thing in one way since well I bought Warhammer online so when it
8597920	8605040	came out and well I have it I have played it like the number of times I
8605040	8609560	have actually played it I can count it on one hand Wow me too I'm in the exact
8609560	8614360	same boat you are and and then and then I started thinking in one way actually
8614360	8621720	since since I was it was a I check actually I didn't check out Wow went
8621720	8630560	back to Wow actually but I did see the new logins frequents the login login
8630560	8641560	screen and that actually made me go we who big frost worm yeah it's got
8641560	8645960	mushroomed well we just had a flying mushroom behave boys and girls in studio
8645960	8655200	sorry our guests are getting unruly all right sorry ahem we're a little
8655200	8660240	distracted here people are throwing things each other's studio yes go ahead
8660240	8665760	well other than that well I'm sorry I'm starting to get sort of in one way
8665760	8671100	pissed also since at the current state I have no TV whatsoever oh my god which

8817320	8823440	well the other week I went to Tokyo game show which was really exciting tell us
8823440	8827800	about that how was Tokyo game show what kind of stuff did you see there oh it
8827800	8833760	was huge very exciting tons of people the biggest booth is probably Xbox 360
8833760	8840240	do you think Xbox 360 is going to turn around in Japan I believe so I mean they
8840240	8845520	had a pretty big booth and tons of people waiting in line they had 105
8845520	8853640	minute wait for one game Wow what game was that I think it was the last remnant
8853640	8857760	mmm I'm kind of not surprised at that yeah because that would be the game that
8857760	8863160	is supposed to like kind of cater to the Japanese audience wow that's why e3
8863160	8868040	can't go public you guys 105 minute waits just to play like one RPG imagine
8868040	8870800	what those Wii U lines would have looked like if it was open to the public of the
8870800	8878400	nut so anyway Wow well I'm glad I'm glad you're having a good time
8878400	8883760	I want to talk about called time hollow okay and it is a Japanese game but it
8883760	8887840	was just released in the States and it is amazing if you ever heard of shadow
8887840	8893000	of destiny's for the PlayStation 1 it's much like that game in which you have to
8893000	8896080	change the past and then it causes something else to change which you got
8896080	8901880	to go back and change again and it has real anime videos throughout the whole
8901880	8906440	game I loved it so it sounds kind of like a puzzle game but with anime
8906440	8914920	cutscenes not a puzzle game it's an adventure game interesting oh Mel chance
8914920	8921920	Mel chance calling it butterfly effect the game yes okay that's kind of cool
8921920	8925520	okay all right I might have to check that out you know there's a lot of these
8925520	8929400	games that really don't show up on the radar like that that I wish would get
8929400	8933520	more coverage so I know to look out for them yeah I was drooling over it for a
8933520	8938200	while in the Japanese stores here Toys R Us and different local stores and

9152480	9157000	no hey Bobby I'm glad you called in cuz worst Airport ever we're always calling
9157000	9163080	in your show in a way but no no no Philadelphia is the worst area yeah let's
9163080	9168480	oh no Dallas is cake y'all are done y'all have never been to Philly compared
9168480	9173640	to Atlanta's Airport sorry Dallas is Chicago sucks anyway sorry Bobby you
9173640	9177320	always let us call into your show but we're never you're never on ours what's
9177320	9181400	on your mind Bobby well no I was just coming it calling in to congratulate you
9181400	9185480	on 300 and you know kind of a question for you guys about your show well thank
9185480	9192360	you where do you see you yourself at episode 400 canceled no I somebody had
9192360	9197000	to say it where do we see ourselves at episode 400 um good question I'll let
9197000	9204920	Loki start probably not much different than it is now I mean as the show
9204920	9208120	fundamentally changed that much as one well I guess in a way yes it has only
9208120	9211920	talking like two years I mean seriously I mean it's since episode one we did
9211920	9217580	change from a you know show about DDR that was very random sometimes I mean my
9217580	9222840	god we're talking about the next systems I think honestly in two years it'll be
9222840	9226880	kind of about the next round of systems I think we'll try to do our best to
9226880	9231440	maintain to stay on the cutting edge of interactive tools I think you will see
9231440	9235560	Orange Launch Radio getting into video more in two years not necessarily that
9235560	9239960	we're gonna be hell we will not in the way you think like not necessarily it'll
9239960	9244920	be our mugs reading the news like it'll be fairies but maybe kind of the shut up
9244920	9250800	maybe the way like folks interact with us I think will be different I I just
9250800	9254220	you know cuz you know we were one of the first shows to really jump on skype when
9254220	9258240	that first came out and you know just in TV we weren't really the first but you
9258240	9261800	know that was a way to kind of expand through that and you know we like to try
9261800	9265000	to stay on the cutting edge of how to stay interactive with the listeners so
9265000	9269160	you know I it's it's hard to think of what hasn't been done yet
9269160	9276320	I don't know does that Sackboy costume have like fur on it does that gun is a
9276320	9280320	furry for you no it's not it's I don't know what is it's stuff it's like
9280320	9284320	sweatshirt material it's like a giant sweatshirt is what it is it's not furry
9284320	9290120	though so and no tingle hat on it no table at this time but we figured this
9290120	9292780	is the closest the listeners are ever gonna get to seeing Loki in a tingle
9292780	9298240	outfit so you gotta you gotta take take what you can no because from what I can
9298240	9303000	understand Loki likes Sackboy so it's not as fun to see him dressed up as that
9303000	9307420	is it would be to see him dressed up as tingle but it's still adorable well I
9307420	9311440	can't help it someone hasn't sold another 800,000 copies of something you
9311440	9315220	know we're working on it well we're friends forever we're putting
9315220	9319960	billboards up for it so and we're given I'm sorry I have I have a PlayStation
9319960	9323800	3 now so I can add Loki to my friends list so you don't have to be Loki's only
9323800	9328000	friend anymore but I have more than one friend now you know yeah he dumped me as
9328000	9331200	his only friend oh there are some other people that actually had a little bit
9331200	9333640	planned already they were playing it not that I could play at them because the
9333640	9337000	servers aren't up yet till tomorrow they're gonna be up tomorrow fuck yeah
9337000	9344520	so yeah can't wait so hey Bobby now that you're on the r-rated show is there
9344520	9347320	anything you want to say about guitar hero world tour you didn't get to say
9347320	9353080	on your show well I see yeah when you added that I didn't get to say on my
9353080	9360560	show that kind of cut it out oh yeah the drums fucking suck and maybe next time
9360560	9365440	Activision really should kind of look at their own equipment before they badmouth
9365440	9369880	the other ones and say hey when dearest breaks you can come by ours cuz it won't
9369880	9375400	break yeah I got I got a break because it's already broken have you thought
9375400	9381120	about checking out rock revolutions drum set just to see if it's better well I
9381120	9384840	don't think it's out yet actually oh my gosh even though the game's out the game
9384840	9388640	is out the drum sets not out until November because apparently they haven't
9388640	9393940	quite figured out the manufacturing of that either and I've played on the drum
9393940	9400360	kit and a couple times but no the actual drum sets not in stores yet it's just
9400360	9404400	the game what I want to know is the drums weren't I mean I don't think I
9404400	9408200	didn't get to play it but it didn't seem that the drums were broken when they
9408200	9413360	were showing it off what happened I mean seriously mass production I guess yeah
9413360	9419880	you know when they're take you know taking stuff like that to a convention
9419880	9425280	they a test it and make sure they only bring the units that work and you know
9425280	9429360	B when a unit breaks they have a replacement or they just closed down
9429360	9432760	that station I remember when rock band was first shown at the packs that you
9432760	9437080	guys weren't at the year before they started out with like three drum sets
9437080	9441600	and they had one by the end of the year by the end of the weekend and you could
9441600	9445200	actually see the other drum sets all like bandaged up in the corner of the
9445200	9452280	booth it was the sad depressed broken machines and I had Dan Teasdale on on I
9452280	9456000	was doing an interview with him for my show from the booth and I asked him
9456000	9459160	about you know the durability of the drum sets and while I was asking the
9459160	9462600	question I looked at the pile of depressed drum sets and he didn't take
9462600	9466880	the bait interesting well it is amazing how those guys talk sometimes they
9466880	9470960	surprised another review so far of said anything about the drum sets breaking I
9470960	9474440	don't mean there is a thread on Kotaku and stuff that they're talking about
9474440	9477640	like a game facts forum thread or something like that that people were
9477640	9481760	saying hey you know we're posted for your drum sets work or not and there's
9481760	9485160	people having problems with guitars having problems with the drum sets I
9485160	9490500	mean just a lot of them I have not seen a single post from anybody that says my
9490500	9495840	drums work perfectly that's not to say that there's none that aren't effective
9495840	9500800	but I just either they're too busy playing the game or they just don't post
9500800	9508400	on forums or whatever everybody has some sort of problem with the drums Wow well
9508400	9512920	I mean yeah I guess it's a good thing I don't buy these games for the drum parts
9512920	9516000	because I'm just not good at drum so I always buy them for guitars but still
9516000	9518280	you know if I ever was interested in doing it someday that's kind of
9518280	9523920	depressing I don't know yeah and I mean I guess now I've got to do the whole RMA
9523920	9528320	process but I'm kind of worried you know have they fixed it yet because some of
9528320	9531040	these threads you know I've looked on the official guitar hero forums which I
9531040	9535180	know are mostly negative because the people only post there when they're
9535180	9540520	pissed or can't play true but they've said you know one guy said I've returned
9540520	9545360	it three times my store has no more every single drum set that I've gotten
9545360	9550200	from the store has a different pad that's broken dang like they can't get
9550200	9554320	one that has all five pads that work maybe they rushed it maybe they just
9554320	9557200	rushed it I think that's really what it is they just didn't take the time to get
9557200	9560680	it right and you want to know what's funny is if you go to Activision's now
9560680	9564440	this is something I didn't say on my show if you go to Activision's support
9564440	9569120	site and you look at the question you know why are my pads not working one of
9569120	9574160	the things that actually says is you may need to hit it harder or softer these
9574160	9580640	drums react differently than other drum games you may have played so they kind
9580640	9584520	of insinuate that it's harmonics is fault that you're trying to play guitar
9584520	9592120	hero in a specific way in a way that works huh because it's weird because
9592120	9597680	ordinary drums they just seem to make noise whenever I hit them yeah you know
9597680	9601080	Bobby and it's just it's kind of funny coming from you because I know you're
9601080	9605480	essentially a professional drummer and you know it's just kind of funny that
9605480	9610520	she a professional drummer isn't playing the drums right apparently yeah and I
9610520	9614360	mean it's you have to smack it really hard for it to register and they say
9614360	9618360	well you may need to hit a pad harder or you may need to hit them softer and I'm
9618360	9624040	like not in that sense you shouldn't have to hit the right pad three times as
9624040	9629280	hard as the middle pad and stuff and I mean I I even plugged in my professional
9629280	9633920	drum kit which I've been passing around photos and oh man that little bit of
9633920	9637360	problem on you have to post that photo in chat because it's hilarious seeing
9637360	9641080	all your equipment just like practically on top of each other I want to ask you
9641080	9644400	though real quick um what about the guitar with the game because for those
9644400	9647280	of us that aren't so much into drums or guitars have you have you played around
9647280	9650920	with that at all I play around a little bit with the guitar and I am happy to
9650920	9655920	report that my guitar looks like it has absolutely no problem now that being
9655920	9661760	said I don't really understand the point of that slider thing the tutorial shows
9661760	9665760	you how to use it and it doesn't work all the time but I think it's because
9665760	9670480	I'm doing it wrong not because the hardware sucks but it's kind of like the
9670480	9677280	lower fret notes in in rock band I'll never use it yeah you know that there's
9677280	9681760	things that you can do with it now one of the things is that is your wah wah so
9681760	9686440	instead of using the whammy bar for for things that maybe you don't have star
9686440	9689600	power you can actually run your hand along that and it does the wah wah thing
9689600	9692720	which is kind of cool and I know weird times just for the novelty factor huh
9692720	9700120	but the guitar feels fine and they actually did add one of the one of the
9700120	9703600	actual software things for people that didn't buy the guitar that they added to
9703600	9708360	get world tour is that now you can have like one note held down and then you can
9708360	9712200	strum down a second note and a third note so they'll do chords that kind of
9712200	9716120	come on like that they're not hammer-ons but you still have to keep one note held
9716120	9721440	down while you bring the second one in interesting huh well I'm still using a
9721440	9725800	guitar hero to explore in all my games that's the only controller I have so
9725800	9731400	it's time for me to get a new one so be interesting and other than that you
9731400	9734520	know people are asking how's the actual game I've been spending most of the day
9734520	9738480	trying to get the game to work so I haven't really gotten too far name
9738480	9742000	although I will say that apparently the storyline behind the game according to
9742000	9746600	the intro screen is Kenny G comes out and hypnotizes everybody and it's your
9746600	9752720	job to un-hypnotize everybody wow that's such a guitar hero story I hope that's
9752720	9757600	fake I mean cuz that's oh that's the opening cinematic is yet like a guy with
9757600	9762080	a clarinet comes out and hypnotizes the entire crowd and so the gh symbol
9762080	9765800	flashes on everybody's cell phone and watch and stuff and they all converge
9765800	9770160	well un-hypnotize the crowd well aren't they gonna feel stupid when they release
9770160	9776920	clarinet hero later on all right Bobby we gotta let you go so we can wrap our
9776920	9783640	show do you have any last thoughts um fuck you people who brag about your
9783640	9788320	hardware that doesn't work all right take care of Bobby and bang guys we
9788320	9791320	wouldn't get here we wouldn't gotten here without you Bobby so thank you thank
9791320	9797960	take care I'll make you I'll make you late in two weeks all right bye all
9797960	9800800	right that's gonna do it for Skype tonight I know lots of people want to
9800800	9803720	get through the could or wanted to get through that couldn't sorry about that
9803720	9808360	but we do want to get back to our lives and and produce episode 301 for you in a
9808360	9812200	couple weeks quickly though some last-minute stories I want to start
9812200	9815840	actually no I'll come to you last drew as a story he wants to we'll come to him
9815840	9817800	last Loki do you have any last minute actually
9817800	9822400	dark Sakura anything no Loki then I just real quick there was a little big
9822400	9828920	planet download that was added into for Japan you know that game ape escape well
9828920	9834280	now you can download a costume for your sack boy that's actually the ape in the
9834280	9839840	game which is kind of funny also army of two is supposed to be getting a movie as
9839840	9842840	well you know it's funny we hear a lot of these movies that are coming out but
9842840	9846840	none of them come out except for like math max Payne I guess they're all next
9846840	9852920	year it's all talk until it actually happens all right so that's it I guess
9852920	9856600	for last minute stories are at one other quick little dedication here
9856600	9859200	drunami wants to do and then we're gonna go around and get final thoughts tonight
9859200	9863800	a little bit of sad news for the wild players that remember the forums
9863800	9870840	remember Ezra Chatterton he was contacted by the make-a-wish foundation
9870840	9875360	because he had a brain tumor and talked to Blizzard and had some things
9875360	9881920	customized for him had a few weapons dedicated to him had an entire tire few
9881920	9888640	characters and quest lines in his honor passed away on Monday October 20th from
9888640	9897840	a stroke and our thoughts are with them well that's very unfortunate and you
9897840	9901480	know I know there was a lot of people that actually went in and did the will
9901480	9905200	you find my dog quest that day just kind of like to because that was his quest
9905200	9908520	and his voice is still in the game so it's very interesting that you know
9908520	9913040	despite you know what's happened in offline he kind of will continue to
9913040	9917560	live on online which is really neat which is something only a video game
9917560	9923560	could do so I know that is a very sad note to end episode 300 with so can
9923560	9929720	somebody make a fart joke or something to bring us back Rob what dongle princess
9929720	9936960	thank you well hey we still have the final thoughts and here wait here this

10036360	10040800	please please if you're in California vote no on prop 8 and then if you do

10044760	10049180	vote no on for hell I'd give you my entire political opinions it's the one
10049180	10054760	about parental notification but yeah yeah vote yes for the monorail no one
10054760	10061280	damn near everything except the monorail look I honestly land even the
10061280	10064360	presidential election pales in comparison to what rights are in store
10064360	10067280	with prop 8 but that obviously I'm a little biased you can probably
10067280	10073520	understand why anyhow dark soccer your final thought reject false icons well
