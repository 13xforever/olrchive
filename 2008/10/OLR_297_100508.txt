What?
What?
As if we weren't running late already.
Here we go.
Let's try that again.
From the top.
Take two.
The following program is intended for mature audiences.
Nintendo introduces their winner lineup in a new DS, ACDC comes to Rockband in a Walmart expansion disc,
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers Hi
How you doing?
I'm here.
Alright, she's here.
She's kicking.
She's feisty.
Hopefully we'll hear some feisty snark a little later.
No, I don't know.
I'm just talking you up.
I'll also say, actually kind of boring tonight in reality.
See, there's feisty.
What?
I knew you had it in you.
All right, say hello as well to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
Good.
All right.
Are you feeling feisty tonight?
No, I'm starting to get a hang, though.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is it something in the air?
Is it what you ate?
It's probably allergies or an X-strain.
That's too bad.
That's usually the one of the two.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

enough weather chat let's talk about video games and of course again join us in our chat room chat.orangelandradio.com if you're listening to us on the podcast you can always send us emails mailbag at orangelandradio.com throughout the week but consider joining us sometime on a Sunday night we're always here every week just ticking away to episode number 300 at the end of this month if you can believe it tonight's episode 297 we're gonna start it off as we always do talking a little bit about our gaming weeks Dark Sakura I'll start off with you how was gaming week
My gaming week was a lot of Ragnarok, as usual.
Addict.
Hey.
Okay, Mr. World of Warcraft.
Hey, when was the last time I said on this show I played World of Warcraft?
When's the last time you actually did?
Today.
Okay.
But wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Yesterday was the first time in like three weeks.
So give me a break.
I also watched game shows.
Awesome.
Namely the VP debate.
Who wants to be a vice president?
Yeah, I don't know.
I actually, I won't get into it, but I actually was moderately disappointed in one party and moderately impressed by the other party, even though I thought they both were kind of...
I will say this, we like to keep our eyes on gaming blogs around the internet and the things they're reporting and of course I'm sure you guys have heard about Kotaku.
They just ran a story that's towards the top of their feed.
It looks like it got pushed at 5 o'clock today.
Sarah Palin in video games.
And if you haven't seen this article, I'm going to link it to you guys here in chat.
And you know,
Democrat, Republican, Independent, I don't care who you are, you've probably seen the jokes about Sarah Palin, and hopefully no matter where you stand, you have a sense of humor about it.
Look at this, they put her face on all these different famous video game shots, like there's Tomb Raider, Sarah.
and here's Metroid.
Sarah is Samus.
The Metroid one actually looks cool.
And Cortana.
Yeah, actually they're not bad.
The Photoshop jobs are actually pretty good.
I gotta say my favorite one though is, you know that one, Move Every Zig right there.
God, what the hell was that game?
Oh, your base or belong to us.
Zero Wing.
Zero Wing, yeah.
Thank you.
Oh my god, that's great.
Very nice.
I like Alaskan Avengers.
So you can check that out.
It looks like it's on Kotaku, but I think it originally comes from a site called Pwn or Die.
Something like that.
There you have it.
Get your politics on.
Hey, no matter where you are, though, just vote.
Freaking vote in November.
It looks like someone's cosplay photo, the same as one.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Rock Band
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm working on an objects in space project and I'm doing a pinball machine.
Oh.
For my art class.
My teacher thought it was a cool idea.
Are you going to take pictures and blog it?
Actually, I'm going to... Put it on your Twitter?
I'm going to make prints of it.
Oh, okay.
If it doesn't turn out like utter crap like I feel it will, but... We still have the space.
I've been too lazy on JustinTV.
I'm pointing to the space where I kept saying I was going to get the GameStop whiteboard.
What was it?
Things that suck about GameStop or something like that we were going to do?
And we still have the space, so we could have a picture of it.
My husband's told me in no uncertain terms that I have to have it preserved forever.
So I figured, because I was going to do something for a pinball room, so I figured I could do it for the pinball room, get a grade for it, and maybe people might like it.
I don't know.
There you go.
They just might.
Game Week was alright.
I played, of course, Saints Row, the first one, quite a bit because live's been fucked up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Any chance of an Earth Defense Force 2018 someday?
No.
Let's see, what else did I play?
Oh, I also played Mercenaries 2 some more.
Did another co-op session with my friend.
That was pretty fun.
And then of course, the big one I've been playing this week, Saints Row 2.
Oh my god, this game is awesome.
Seriously, if you're going to compare Saints Row 2 to Grand Theft Auto 4, I think the real thing that kind of stands out is this game is a lot more fun, I guess.
It's...
Right from the get-go, very over-the-top, very just fun to play.
So it's campy fun?
It is kind of campy fun, but I'm playing right now through one of the gang missions, through the Brotherhood, which is one of the three, well, technically four gangs in the game.
And it just keeps getting more fucked up as you play it.
I mean, I don't want to spoil anything, but...
They kind of are getting back at each other.
One does something to the other group and in return they retaliate with something even more harsh.
It's getting nuts.
But the game, it's got a lot of really good radio stations on the actual vehicles and stuff.
They have a lot of good licensed music.
In fact, their 80s station is fucking awesome.
Did you say something on your Twitter about crashing while you were listening to some song?
No, no, we were flying in a biplane, buzzing over a freeway, shooting at cars while listening to Land From Down Under.
I mean, that's just...
It's just so crazy.
And there's a lot that catches you off guard.
There's a mission that there is a direct reference to Jack Thompson in.
Just a lot of really fun stuff.
And, I mean, this game has literally made me forget about Grand Theft Auto 4.
It's that good.
Now, first I must say, though, the graphics in the game, they are a step up from the first game.
The glitches, there are still some glitches in this game, and some pretty bad ones at times.
Like, there'll be nothing that really stops the game from working, just kind of like, huh.
Here's Loki playing Saints Row 2.
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you all!
You're gonna die!
So yeah, going back to the glitches.
This is why we have a chat room.
There was one time where I had blown up a bunch of stuff during a Mayhem mission, and when I came back after the mission was done, the park benches hadn't respawned, but people were still sitting down like there was benches there.
There was another one where I was watching a cutscene with some vehicles or whatever in a caravan, and each one of the vehicles in the caravan ran into a telephone pole that was on the corner because they were...
It's like the AI is sort of off a little bit, like in their paths.
It's just like off slightly.
Like there'll be another move you can do with a samurai sword where you can literally stab someone up through their throat, but it's too high.
So you're stabbing above them and it just reacts.
Like up the nose?
No, like above their head.
It just acts like you're reacting to hitting them, but it's not quite right.
And this is the release version?
Yeah.
Yes, but here's the thing.
It doesn't matter, though.
It's still early awesome, and they have chainsaw kills just like Gears of War.
It sounds like it's not going to be graphically the greatest game ever or the sound or whatever, but it's just for you, it's just fun.
It's big, dumb, stupid, blow shit up fun.
It is.
It's like blow shit up the game.
That's pretty much what it is.
That's what you've always wanted.
Something like that.
But yeah, that's pretty much what... If you're looking for a game that's supposed to be cutting edge and stuff...
Lightening Lightening
I'm not touching Saints Row 2 until I finish 1, lol
Redertainment in chat says, thank god for patches.
How is the developer with patches?
Um, pretty good, I guess.
I mean, last game they only did one patch on it, so it didn't really fix a lot of the glitches in it.
And there are still some glitches from the first game that you can do in this one.
Like, for example, if you hop on top of a car and you hit the Y button to get in, you'll just instantly teleport inside the car, just like you could in the first game.
Um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and um they have a whole the customization of the characters is just insane they've added so many different sliders I literally spent 40 minutes in this game um setting up my character to look like me so you know it's so elaborate with like actually taking pictures of my face and trying to get the proportions correct I don't know we'll see if it looks correct when uh we we actually show it off but uh
You can make some really fucked up looking characters in this game though, seriously.
And it's funny because they always comment to you, they're like, did you do something with your hair?
That's their comment because you can be a totally different gender.
But they have three different voices for male and female that you can pick from.
You can pick your...
your stance, they have a taunt and they also have kind of like a compliment little gesture you can do they have everything for doing the little jig that what's her name did and to like Michael Jackson stuff I have my guy kind of doing the A for happy days and then my taunt is just flipping someone the bird that's funny nice
but yeah, lots of customization, really fun game seriously you gotta check it out alright
I've been playing some new games this week as well.
I've been playing the old standbys as well.
World of Warcraft, as I mentioned DarkSakura earlier.
Just squeezing some more in before the new Wrath of the Lich King comes out.
Which, by the way, I'm thinking I'm going to buy at 7-Eleven.
I was at 7-Eleven randomly because I was craving a Slurpee at like 2 o'clock in the morning.
And they have a big old ad there for reserving games.
Like Wrath of the Lich King and all these other... What else was coming out that they were pushing?
and other sports games that were coming out and all this stuff.
And I'm thinking, who's going to buy their freaking games at 7-Eleven?
There's going to be nobody there the night it launches.
So I think that might be where I go to get it.
We'll see.
But also, there's a big, big content patch coming to Warcraft on Tuesday and it's going to change everything.
It's like the pre-
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
New games I've been playing this week.
Mega Man 9 finally came out on the Xbox 360, so I decided to pick it up because I wasn't going to get it on the Wii because I don't have the space.
And then on PlayStation 3, I don't even have yet because LittleBigPlanet's not out, so I probably won't crack until next week and get a PlayStation 3.
But I did finally get Mega Man 9 on Xbox 360.
It's fun, it's hard, it's retro, it's probably everything you've heard about.
Although I will say this, the controls were not as bad as I was expecting.
I thought the controls were going to be horrific on the Xbox 360.
It actually isn't that bad.
I'm actually able to use...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Splash Woman stage, I probably played that like 25 times and died many, many times.
But now I can get through it without dying because it's just about memorizing where you jump when.
That's what it is.
It's all pattern memorization.
That's it.
Ranma says, Wow.
I don't know about that.
I think that's more of a res application actually.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura.com
And it's just scary.
You know, you got the ambient music playing.
This is actually a track from Silent Hill 3, not the new game, but that's alright.
You know, and I'm just walking around and everything's all dark and scary.
And I'll tell you what, this game totally relies on cheap thrills.
You know, like I'll be walking around and exploring, trying to find the other half of the x-ray so I can solve that first little puzzle.
And then, BAM!
A wheelchair falls down from the staircase and scares the fucking shit out of me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The graphics aren't quite as good as I would have expected for a next generation Silent Hill game, but it's by no means bad.
It's probably on par with the last generation of games, but just a widescreen and a little bit crisper.
TigerClaw asks, when I saw Pyramid Head, was I scared and screaming with joy?
Here's the thing, I didn't get far enough because that night, seriously, after the wheelchair fell down the staircase, and my, no, I'm not even kidding with you, my front door blew open right after that happened.
I was like, fuck this, I can't play this game right now.
So I turned it off.
I tried playing a little more.
I played for about another 90 minutes the next day.
And I noticed there was a distinct lack of save points.
But I got through the first little area and got to another one.
But I haven't gotten to Pyramid Head yet.
That tells you I'm not that far in the game at all.
So I can't give a full review to this game because I haven't really seen enough of it.
But I definitely can already tell it's worthy of being a Silent Hill game.
And if you like cheap scares, you'll enjoy it.
HendersonMan in chat says, Silent Hill looks better than that Siren crap.
I couldn't get into Siren.
I will say, though, in the very, very beginning of the game is one of those places where it starts to turn from day to night.
You know, good Silent Hill, Dark Silent Hill, or whatever you want to call it.
And that's creepy.
It is very creepy.
But it's pretty much the same.
It's a cinematic.
It's not really something that happens live as is going on.
Anyway.
Henderson Man does confirm that the save points are few and far between.
So, when you see a save point in Silent Hill, cherish it.
Although, from what I understand, the game does kind of auto-save as you go, so that if you do die, you don't have to go all the way back to your last save point.
But if you turn it off, you do.
So, there you go.
I'm having fun with Silent Hill Homecoming.
I will play more of it this week.
Maybe not when I'm home by myself, though.
Because it's a little bit scary.
A little bit scary.
Thanks for watching!

Yes, that's four different social networking sites and four different names that we have on each of them.
We have a real problem with consistency here at Orange Lounge Radio.
All right, let's get into some gaming news tonight.
Part A tonight is almost all Nintendo news.
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's that little press conference they had just dominated the news this week.
Tons and tons of Nintendo news.
So that's where we're going to start tonight.
Right, Loki?
Yes.
And of course, the big news coming out of Nintendo's press conference was that they're announcing the brand new revision for the DS.
DSi
Also, the system has two cameras on it.
A 0.3 megapixel camera, which will be facing the user, kind of in between the one touch screen and the other screen there.
Also, there is a 1.3 megapixel camera on the outside.
The screens are slightly larger now.
They're 3.25 inches wide.
and you can also sync your photos with the Wii Photo Channel and also it will include a free web browser application built inside as well.
Also, just like the rumor said, you can play back your music on there.
It will be using AAC...
and DarkSakura.
Not getting it for a while, unfortunately.
Why, because they hate us?
Yes, because they hate us.
And because they say that the DS is selling so well over here.
Not anymore, now that you announced a brand new version that will be coming out next year, stupid.
God.
And also, the other big thing about it is there will be a new DSi shop where you'll be able to download games, kind of like WiiWare, but for the DS.
Some of the games range from free to about 800 points.
Kind of cool.
You're obviously the homebrew fan on this show, and Tigerclaw in chat says the DS homebrew community are going to pretty much find ways to hack the DSi since they can use the SD cards to do all sorts of things.
True?
False?
Yes, definitely.
And, you know, the memory card thing will definitely help.
Also, the fact that there's cameras built into it.
I'm assuming there's going to be a little bit more RAM built into it as well.
It just...
it's not going to be that hard especially since it has to play all the other DS cartridges so at the very least it will still work the way the DS does as far as homebrew stuff goes so does this mean you're going to kind of want one?
Yeah, the thing, though, that you have to understand, though, with this one, and I thought that they had onboard storage as well, like a little bit of onboard storage.
I could be wrong, though, is that this one will probably be able to receive some sort of firmware updates, whereas the other ones weren't.
I don't know.
What if this didn't have the SD card slot on it?
Would you still be as interested, or would it be not interested because there's no way to hack it?
No, I'd still be interested.
Really?
Yeah, you could still hack it.
I mean, you just...
Do it the way you're doing it now.
So I'm kind of wondering what other features they're going to have on there or how they're going to utilize different things.
I guess we have a lot of time, so we'll get to see what comes out in Japan first, I guess.
Comments from chat room.
Seg says, about the web browser, it's roundabout free.
Each DSi will get 500 Nintendo points, known as Wii points formerly, which can be used to buy the 500 point opera browser on the DSi.
I heard about that whole 500 free points thing they were supposed to be doing.
Yeah.
I think that the web browser is just free anyways.
It's kind of like how it was when it came out over here, where it's free for a while and now they charge for it.
I like this comment too.
I want to read this.
TheRobD in our chatroom, chat.orangelaunchradio.com, says, Yay.
I have to admit, I kind of agree.
I'm not that excited about this little device.
In fact, I've been jokingly calling it the DSiPhone because that's pretty much what it is but without the phone.
It's kind of like an iTouch.
So it's a DSiPhone, no, iPod Lite or Touch or whatever?
An iTouch, yeah, DSiTouch or whatever you want to call it.
In my mind, that's kind of what they're trying to do with this whole download store thing is that it's kind of trying to mirror that applications thing that the iTouch or the iPhone does, which I don't think they're trying to copy or anything because this thing's probably been in development for a long, long time.
But I don't know.
I can't –
Here's the thing.
I think I'm going to have to get one anyway.
Because you know there's going to be that game that comes out at some point where you have to use the camera.
Nintendo just freaking does this.
There'll be some Mario game I'm going to want to get.
If this is as secure as the Wii was with their virtual console and their...
WeWear Games I don't think we'll have to worry about spending money on the application store.
Well, but hold on though.
I mean, you know, come on.
I don't like to do that unless it's usually like import stuff or things you can't get here because, you know, I like to support stuff that's good.
But, you know...
No, I'm wondering though if they haven't announced yet anything about the virtual console stuff.
I'm wondering if some virtual console games will be compatible with this because that would be kind of cool.
You know what?
That alone would actually make me seriously consider getting one because that would really justify all those purchases I've been making.
That would be awesome.
Yeah, because can you imagine download to your SD memory card slot or whatever for like maybe stop it at like Super Nintendo games or something like that.
I've gotten to the point where I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo because I'm like, well, yeah, that would be cool, but they're not going to do it.
There'll be an adapter that you're going to have to pay $40 for that'll do it.
I've gotten really cynical when it comes to Nintendo just based on history at this point.
So I don't get excited about these types of things anymore.
It's kind of sad.
TigerClaw says, DSi also opens a new can of worms.
People will be sharing very inappropriate photos with each other via PictoChat.
Oh, great.
So if I go into the Penny Arcade Expo room at next year's PAX 09 and DSi or whatever, am I going to get cock shots all over my DS from people putting it down their pants and taking a picture?
Maybe.
Hooray.
But... What?
You might get boob shots, too.
I might.
I wouldn't mind that.
Ha ha ha!
Alright, if you want to chat on this, chat.orange.com Other things that were announced at Nintendo's press conference, speaking of SD cards, finally, and you know this has been a big thing for me lately, I've bitched and bitched and bitched and belly ached and cried and been a big baby about the fact that I do not believe I should have to
Remove my games from the Wii to put them on a card and then bring them back.
You know, this whole slow process.
I think they just should address the stupid onboard storage problem on the Wii.
And they finally have.
You will finally be able to load channels directly from the SD cards in spring of 2009.
The biggest duh in the world.
The thing that we knew should have been there the whole freaking time.
Finally they are installing in spring of 2009.
Why is it taking until spring 2009?
Why can't they do it now?
I mean...
I think they honestly didn't program it in to begin with.
I think they're trying to close up homebrew loops with this too.
I bet you that's what they're trying to do.
When they release this patch, they're going to do their damnedest to stop the exploiting.
They're not going to stop it, but I guess they feel they have an obligation to all the people that developed for their system to try.
Good luck with that.
Maybe you should talk to Sony and see how well that went with them and the PSP.
Don't you think they owe it to their developers to try?
Yeah, they owe it to their developers to try, but I don't think it's really hurting them right now as far as it's not allowing... Well, I guess it could allow piracy, but so far the community has been good about keeping that out.
And they do have a thing to load ISOs off of the memory cards or whatever, but it doesn't work really well.
Here's why the update's taking forever.
They don't want you to copy stuff on your SD card, take it to your friend's house, and put it on their Wii.
So they're having to come up with the whole, how are we going to get around this copy thing?
DRM, basically.
They're implementing DRM.
That's part of the testing, pushing this thing back.
They already have DRM implemented.
Because if you move channels... They're Nintendo.
It takes them fucking forever to do something.
There, that's it.
We'll just leave it at that.
They're also the masters of making us buy new things.
But guess what?
To be fair, this is a free update.
It's not something that's going to cost us any money, except for the fact that Nintendo-branded SD cards are always $10 more than the other ones.
Well, then don't buy them.
I know, don't.
Well, here's the other thing that you're going to have a problem with, too, is they haven't announced that they're going to expand the number of channels you can have, so you're still fucked.
You're going to run out of channels eventually.
Well...
But maybe that's just kind of a given.
I'm not going to hold that against them yet.
And that is a lot of space.
Or maybe the thing's smart enough to fill in with more channels.
I don't know.
Has anybody ever filled the damn thing up?
I imagine it's possible.
If you download nothing but Nintendo games.
And what happens?
You just can't put it anymore?
You can't put it anymore.
Wow, that sucks.
Huh.
Patch!
Alright.
It might be a part of this patch that you'll add new channels.
I'm not getting negative about that yet.
But we'll see.
More to come in 2009.
As far as other things that are going to be coming out for the Wii, the Wii Speak channel was unveiled.
Wii Speak is the microphone peripheral that's coming with Animal Crossing and is getting its own channel.
And that's about all that we know right now, that it's just Wii Speak.
So it's going to get its own channel though, so it's not something you're going to have to use Animal Crossing for.
I would assume, but there's no true details yet, so we'll just have to wait and see.
I'm actually thinking that something like that would work for them to do karaoke games.
Hmm.
That'd be interesting.
Or just call your friend.
I mean, seriously.
Well, but... Do you really... Hold on, hold on.
Long distance costs money.
Minutes cost money.
That's why VOIP is getting popular.
So I...
Yeah, but most people have pretty decent phone plans.
I mean, hell, people are spending like $100 a month on stupid unlimited plans.
Hell, my plan, which is dirt cheap, has unlimited nights and weekends and long distances included in there.
I mean, seriously, just... Okay, what if I want to talk to someone at 4 in the afternoon?
I have a cell phone.
I don't have a landline.
I know, I don't have a landline either.
But myself, I only have so many daytime minutes on myself.
Maybe I want to talk to people.
Or maybe one other thing is that, you know, maybe I want to talk to rooms.
Like, you know, somebody can talk to a party.
I text.
I text more than I talk on the phone.
And Dan uses his phone pretty much only people who call him or business.
And you get those rollover minutes and there you go.
Sagan Chat says, WeSpeak will also use friend codes for chatting with friends.
And follows up with, I don't know, WeSpeak would make a great room phone.
Groups talking to groups.
That's what I'm saying.
Network parties together.
That's going to be its biggest benefit.
But yeah, I think the friend codes for WeSpeak is a given.
I cannot imagine a Nintendo place where you could go into a room and chat with strangers.
Can you imagine the potential for horrible stories that could come with that?
I know, sad.
You have to understand, they come up with these ideas.
Sorry, that's too cool for our console.
You could kind of do that on Xbox Live now, except you're going to have to settle for Fusion Frenzy 2.
I put my phone on speaker and play Mario Party.
In which case, I think I'd rather chew glass.
There's always Vivo Pinata Party, which is slightly better.
So instead of chewing glass, Rob would want to chew plastic.
Mario Party is definitely the top tier, you know what I mean?
Let's move on.
We should make our own party game.
What would an Orange Launch Radio party game be?
Well, you'd have your weirdo map all over the place.
Get naked and tell your friends.
No, like Mario Party, except you've got weapons.
And you can get a tank.
Or a Humvee with a rocket launcher on it.
Mortal Kombat Party.
And, and, and, and, and.
What?
Sometimes the dice will have dirty commands on it.
And there'll be lots of guys making out.
Wait, Lick, Kiss, Suck.
You've got the dirty dice part of the game.
You have to roll them for guys making out.
Okay.
Sadly, I think no one would buy this game.
Yes, exactly.
So, a game that someone might buy, Pikmin.
They're actually doing a brand new series of games called Play on the Wii, or Wii Day Sobu.
And...
GameCube Games GameCube Games
And didn't everybody say back then, oh, just you wait, here comes the tidal wave, everything will be re-released.
And sure enough, here they go, they're re-releasing Pikmin, basically the GameCube version with, you know, fuckin' Wii controls thrown in there, woohoo!
And, um, yeah, so that'll be the first game that's gonna be part of that, but, um...
Never fear, though.
It's not actually the Pikmin game they were talking about before, which Miyamoto alluded to.
He is actually making a new Pikmin game.
This is not like, hey, we're going to release a new Zelda game.
Oh, just kidding.
It's the old Zelda game.
I'm actually kind of okay with this whole re-releasing of games things because you know everybody has that one game that they want out of this.
For me, it's F-Zero.
and maybe there's people that won't win Waker.
I don't know.
Isn't there something on GameCube?
Or what about Metroid Prime 1 and 2?
There's got to be something you want out of this.
Right, Loki?
No.
Maybe win Waker, but that's it.
Anyways, the Pikmin game is coming out December 25th in Japan.
It's going to be available for 3,800 yen, and that's approximately 36 bucks U.S.,
and also some other games that are going to be coming later on.
Nintendo's going to be releasing Donkey Kong Jungle Beat apparently on... Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
But with the lack of beat.
Yes, I guess before Pikmin, even though this was supposedly the first game, but Donkey Kong Jungle Beat will be coming out on December 11th in Japan.
Also coming soon will be Chibi-Robo Pikmin 2, Mario Tennis, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2, and... Of course, of course.
That's it.
No word on release dates for the rest of those, but...
Yeah, that's kind of cool, I guess, because the Wii certainly doesn't have enough GameCube ports.
All right.
I'm currently depressed.
I know.
While Loki was reading that story, what happened?
I pulled my DS out of my purse because I was looking for something, and the corner broke off.
How did that happen?
I don't know.
It must have gotten broken in my purse.
That sucks.
I guess I have to get a DSi now.
Oh, that's what she does.
No, but she's totally serious.
She was just showing it.
The corners, like, snapped off.
Yeah, I'll put it on the camera.
Is that how you get the husband to buy you new toys?
Aw, Dan, I broke it.
You can just get toys anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Dan, I broke it.
I'm sorry.
I need a new one.
Here, you know, I have a... No, I can fix this with duct tape and silicone glue.
There ain't nothing duct tape can't fix.
Seriously, just look at it.
I can fix it with silicone glue.
If you guys want these games, why don't you just buy the original GameCube games?
Remember, they do play on the Wii.
But enhanced Wii controls.
Really?
Have you known any games that the controls actually enhance the playability?
How many people prefer to play on the GameCube controller for Mario Kart and Smash Bros.?
Is it really enhancing stuff?
I'm sorry, no.
It's just going to get people to...
I don't know why more of their products and it's an excuse they're saying look we're still releasing first party products oh but they are remakes what if the games are only 20 bucks that's about how much a lot of the GameCube games still cost like the old Smash Brothers if they're 20 bucks then awesome hmm alright would you consider buying them if they were only 20 bucks no
DarkSakura is currently showing off that the DS does still work over on our Justin.TV feed, which you can see at Justin.TV slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Meanwhile, back to more news about the DSi.
And earlier, Loki had mentioned that there's going to be a store that's opening up, and that's why I kind of joked that it's the DSi phone.
But it is opening up, and they've already announced what the first few games are going to be available on the DSi shop.
And guess what?
They are games that you can already get in a traditional card format.
Brain Age 1 and Brain Age 2.
But, but, but...
Thank you for watching!
because you know before too long in this DSi shop it'll be download new games for Brain Age not like necessarily a full blown Brain Age 3 but like download new brain training sequences as if they were rock band songs you know it's coming right that's why they're doing this they want a piece of the microtransaction pie and the Wii wasn't really set up to handle it very well even though I guess maybe Rock Band 2 is going to have it after all but still hmm
Why not?
The DS is out there.
Tons and tons of people have one.
It's a hugely popular system.
I have a broken one!
Let's bring microtransactions to it.
Let's get you to buy another DS system.
Maybe Nintendo will sell you some duct tape for 500 Nintendo points.
Because really, the DS is just kind of like an upgraded Game Boy Advance, and how many times have they tried to get you to buy the Game Boy?
Yeah.
Too many.
But, but, but... I have to get another one now.
And besides, with them releasing a new system like the DSi, they can release Mario, Super Mario Bros.
DSi, and Mario Kart DSi.
How about CSi DSi?
Rob?
How about CSI DSI?
CSI DSI, I like that idea.
That would be like a major awesome marketing point.
That would be awesome.
Alright, let's move on.
I'm going to weep.
Why?
I'm weeping inside of my soul.
Why?
Because you're DS?
I am.
Can we have a moment of silence please?
Excuse me.
Alright, there we go.
The ferret would like to make a statement on behalf of my poor, broken, like me, DS.
And what could that be?
Game News!
Sin and Punishment 2!
It's coming on Wii.
That's it.
Interesting because Sin and Punishment 1 was never really released in the US.
So that's kind of interesting.
I mean, it was.
We got it on Virtual Console.
Yeah, years later on Virtual Console.
That thing must have sold real well for them to want to bring that out over here.
Because that's an interesting game to dig out of the archives.
It's pretty badass looking, though.
Yeah, is that something you might be interested in picking up?
Yes.
It's looking pretty cool to me.
I wanted the first one to come out, although we didn't pick up the Nintendo 64 one online, but, you know.
You can always maybe get an import one of the real thing, but they're probably hard to come by at this point.
I doubt it.
I've seen them.
I've seen carts.
You can get imported Nintendo 64 carts for not bad.
All right.
Well, hey, if they release a demo or something or I can play a little bit of it, maybe I'll buy it.
It looks interesting.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and by earning points by purchasing their games and I guess accessories, I'm not really sure about that, you will be able to trade those points in for Neato rewards like different accessories that are exclusive to the program.
You might remember in Japan they did some of those Game & Watch DS games.
There was a Tingle Balloon Flight game or Balloon Fight.
There was that weird...
Power Rangers looking thing.
I don't know.
But yeah, lots of exclusive stuff.
So that's pretty cool.
Hopefully we don't get lame shit on our side, you know.
Because they may have Club Nintendo and it's like, stickers!
Temporary tattoos!
Plastic rings!
Wallpapers!
Yay!
Mario underwear!
Yay!
Well, it was...
I've registered a lot of old Nintendo games on Nintendo's official site just in case something like this ever happened.
Am I going to get credit for that?
No, you're not.
Then I'm not registering anything else until this comes out.
Because I bought Wii Fit this week.
It doesn't matter because there's going to be something different.
There's a different Club Nintendo thing that you're going to have to register and not the actual games themselves.
But isn't that where the whole... Isn't that where I get the points from?
Yes, but that's going to be something separate.
Well, then why should I continue to register?
Why should you continue to buy anything from them?
That's what I say.
Well, if they put out a good game, I'm going to buy it.
And I wanted Wii Fit anyway, because I'm fat.
So... Rob!
What?
Come here.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Put your microphone down.
Stand up.
Come this way, because I'm not getting up.
Hold out your hand.
Ow!
Now, STFU.
Whatever, I need to tone.
But you're not fat.
Alright, now that I've been abused during this program.
It's not abuse, it's chastisement.
Can we please move on with gaming news?
Oh, it's me, hey.
Yeah, Rob.
Alright, well, the game The Conduit.
Lots of people have been looking forward to this because it's all sci-fi, futuristic-y, first-person shooter-y.
But hey, it's on the Wii.
And apparently, here's the weird thing, the Conduit was announced at the press event that it's going to be an exclusive first party shooter.
That's because she's a dumbass.
A lot of people got really excited about it.
Who do we mean by she, Loki?
The dumbass.
The one that talks about snowboarding and her son is so awesome because he makes cards for her.
Cammy Dunaway.
Yes, the dumbass.
So, here's the thing.
Apparently, it was called a first-party title, but then, a little later, apparently, it actually was retracted.
Nintendo is not actually publishing the conduit.
I knew right away that she was an idiot when she said that.
It said first party shooter.
I'm like, she meant first person shooter.
She's just dumb.
Whatever.
But really, I wouldn't be surprised if they picked this up.
And I think that they should anyways because...
Come on, man.
Seriously.
I guess the only concern would be that they're competing with themselves.
Does it really matter?
I mean, is it just like the ad dollars and the marketing push that will come out of it, depending on who picks it up?
You know, who's got the money to sell it?
I guess.
It's not going to change a damn thing about the game itself, right?
No, it's not.
But it's just that if there's a publisher, then it means it's coming out sooner.
It's just, you know, that.
And I don't understand why anyone wouldn't publish this game anyways.
There's been so much hype around it, and Nintendo's been pushing it so much anyways, and they don't have a publisher yet.
I mean, it's kind of retarded to be pushing a game that's not going to be coming out anytime soon, but whatever.
Well, I don't know.
Loki, this looks like something, and you've talked about this game before.
Do you care who publishes it, or you hate the game, or what?
No, I don't care.
Alright.
Well, then let's move on.
Well, Ian, remember that we talked about the game that even a penguin could play?
Mm-hmm.
And, Rob, you like penguins.
I love penguins.
Rob, that's why you should be running Linux.
Hi.
Well, you know, I like penguins just not that much.
Anyway.
That's why you should be wearing tuxedos, Rob.
I know, and that's why I should live in Antarctica.
And you should eat tuna.
You know, there's warm water penguins.
Anyway, the Penguin game is actually made by Yuji Naka that's called Let's Tap, which is, and it has nothing to do with penguins, I think.
Like tap dancing?
I don't know, but I guess it's supposed to be another kind of, I guess, I don't know if it's a music kind of game, but you use the Wiimote face down.
You basically, the game is played by facing the Wiimote, you put it face down on something, a surface, and you hit that surface with your fists, and it makes the Wiimote bounce, and you use that in different little mini-games.
Interesting.
Can I continue with my story, too?
Well, Let's Tap sounds like a tap-dancing game to me.
I don't know if you remember this.
I don't know.
Well, also, first of all, had I not been interrupted, I would have actually said something about... Oh!
That's what we do on this show.
Alright, what else?
Well, the other game is one called 428, which is a game that uses real photos of people in the city with text on it.
But it was actually shown in the whole show role thing that they did at the conference.
This will be out in December.
National Penguin Day No, I made that up
Alright, we'll see.
Let's read a book.
That should be a game that comes out on DS.
Let's read a book.
Let's get edumacation.
Let's watch television instead.
I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with Let's Read a Book.
I mean, seriously, some of the stuff that they come out with...
Weird!
Let's poop.
Yeah.
So, anyways, there were some other announcements that they made during the second day of their press event.
And these were, of course, new WiiWare games.
And, of course, the first one, which I think they've already talked about before, Tetris Party.
It's a brand new Tetris game.
In fact, there's modes in it that kind of look like Luminous a bit.
And...
They're actually going to even have a mode where it's called squat mode where you play using your ass on the Wii balance board and you drop your pieces that way.
I don't like hearing you squat and drop your pieces.
I pay good money for my Wii.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah, they went there.
And then, of course...
There's another game which they're comparing to LittleBigPlanet.
I'm sorry, no.
That's not even close.
But it's called Boings because there's a Z at the end because that's hip and cool.
It's from the company Ninja Bees who have put out a bunch of other games which all seem to look similar to each other.
And I guess they were saying that this game is kind of LittleBigPlanet meets LocoRoco.
And it's a 2D, 3D puzzler platformer.
and it's going to be I guess it follows these elastic creatures who are called the Boings and they can be grabbed and stretched and flicked across 30 levels of the game.
And I guess the game should be coming out pretty soon because it's just been submitted to Nintendo for approval and should be out either October 20th or 27th.
It is no LittleBigPlanet though, that's for sure.
But seriously, all their games look similar.
I guess the Tetris one kind of looks interesting.
We'll see.
It's neat.
By the way, we were talking about Tapit, obviously, a little bit ago.
Our chat room broke out in a game of Bop It.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyway, I was trying to look for a clip of that commercial on YouTube to play in the background, but all I could find were commercials for Kidz Bop.
I didn't want to play those on the air.
That would be kind of frightening.
Can you imagine if there was a Kidz Bop sing star?
Alright, we've got to wrap up the Nintendo Press Conference, but there are so many more games we didn't even begin to talk about, like Punch-Out!
Hello, Punch-Out!
Also, a new WarioWare game is coming out, Mario & Luigi 3.
We have some of the other games that were coming out announced for the Wii...
There's a Clonoa remake, apparently.
Or it might be a new... No, it's a remake.
Door to Phantomville.
Clonoa!
Clonoa!
There is a karaoke game coming from Hudson.
Punch Out!
We didn't even talk about that, but it looked like in the previews there was King Hippo was back in it.
I know, I heard you.
A game called Cosmic Walker, which is a spacewalking game.
A memory game called Start with 100 Words.
But Clonoa... Remember these 100 words or you die!
Forever Blue 2, Beautiful Ocean, the sequel to Endless Ocean was also announced.
And, and, and, some video from Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Echoes of Time that connects the DS to the Nintendo Wii.
Wasn't this supposed to be a launch title?
Clonoa.
Shut up!
Maybe.
Trace Memory, also known as another code.
Wand of Magic an action RPG that's all on the Wii and then of course plenty of crap on the DS as well including Mario and Luigi RPG 3 and another WarioWare game and a 3D version of Picross supposed to come out as well wow that sounds boring and a fortune telling game you remember the old taboo game on the NES I remember Klonoa I'm gonna kill you in your sleep
Oh, Jamie, Jamie, this game's right up your alley.
This is great.
Wait, what is this?
Wagamama Fashion Girls Mode.
It's a fashion game from Nintendo.
But Klonoa.
No, Klonoa's not in it.
I have Klonoa.
That game has a sad bummer ending.
Spoiler!
This show's going to have a bummer ending if you don't shut up about Klonoa.
Voldemort kills Klonoa.
Really?
Klonoa sounds like a sexually transmitted disease.
It kind of does, actually.
No.
Hey, that's about it we have for the Nintendo press conference.
But in our pre-OLR twit that we asked on the Twitter, it's twitter.com slash OLR, we asked this question to you guys.
Did Nintendo's press conference this week make up for their lackluster E3 showing?
Why or why not?
Loki, what do you think?
Before we get to the Twitter answers.
I thought that they made up for it a little bit, but there's still no mention of Disaster Day of Crisis, which I heard that they're...
Waiting to see how it does in Europe before they release it over here.
What?
I mean, that's kind of retarded.
Seriously, you're just waiting to see how it does in Europe?
That's going to piss people off.
But, I mean, I don't know.
I'm kind of... It was a little bit more exciting than what they showed at E3, but at the same time, I look at what they're putting out.
A remake of Punch-Out!
A remake of Pikmin!
Uh...
I don't know, a sequel to a game that we didn't get over here, which looks alright, but it's just okay.
It's nothing like, woo, awesome.
So in other words, you wanted more original IPs?
I wanted something a little bit, you know, they could have just shown Disaster Day of Crisis, because that actually looked pretty cool.
What about Conduit?
They did show Conduit.
I mean, that's a new thing.
Yeah, they showed Conduit, which, who knows when the hell that's going to be published.
In fact, there was something I heard about, like, Wii Motion Plus being added to it, and so that means it's not coming out until after March.
DarkSakura, what do you think?
Did they redeem themselves from E3?
I really, it's a really wait and see thing for me.
It really is a wait and see thing for me.
Just because I've gotten excited about stuff and then found out it to be a big load of crap.
And I don't like to be excited about loads of crap.
I would rather think, oh that looks like crap and be pleasantly surprised.
The conference was okay for me.
There wasn't anything that made me squee.
I think that's the thing.
It was missing that certain Nintendo fanboy squee, giggle, I love you Nintendo, have my babies.
That was kind of missing.
Well, then I'm glad you got something out of it.
But for me, there wasn't really any of that.
Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
Punch-Out didn't look that... I mean, it just looked updated, like, graphics-wise.
I mean, that's something that could have been released on WiiWare.
It doesn't look that different.
It's just like, ooh, look, now it's cel-shaded.
Awesome.
Is it any different?
Well, let's see what your Twitter users thought.
GS68 says, Sin and Punishment 2.
Too bad I was in Computer Lab when I read that, so I had to contain my fangasmic screens.
DJ Ranma S says, Nope.
As much as I like the DSi and the new games, still wasn't much to bring to the table.
Nice try, Ninty.
See you next year.
Actdeft says, At first I thought it was going to be the same lackluster conference, for the exception of the DSi, but then Nintendo went on and it was better.
Crows said, yeah, at least this one wasn't about cowbells, Animal Crossing, Wii Sport, puppies, Wii Music, or crazy drummers.
I don't want the new DS.
DarkTetsuya says, well, I wasn't crazy about the idea of buying another DS revision.
However, the new Punch-Out sounds kick-ass even without Tyson.
Here's what's bugging me about Nintendo.
They're not trying to innovate at all.
They're not.
They're just putting out what they can get by as something new.
Hold up, though.
Wasn't the Wii console itself innovation?
That's fine, but they did that, what, a couple years ago?
Now it's time for something new.
Time to keep up with the innovations.
No, don't encourage them to put out new peripherals.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Old, made slightly new again.
They don't get it.
I think they're just watching what other people are doing, what's succeeding, and trying to emulate that, but they don't understand why it's working.
More responses from the Twitter.
Did the Nintendo press conference this week make up for the lackluster showing at E3?
Chris says, almost everything at the conference was rumored for a while, so it was pretty meh itself.
Picaruno says, just flat out, hell no.
Jacksonman says, yes, to an extent it did.
Something new is better than nothing.
Joshua Rover says, Ro-ever?
Ro-ever.
Joshua Ro-ever.
I had to spell it out.
It says, the recent press conference Nintendo held has completely redeemed them to me.
They really do care about the hardcore that built them.
Deekman says, nope, still pretty lackluster.
Ionotropic says, hell no, they're still not catering to the core gamer.
That's almost two completely conflicting answers there.
It's really interesting between that and what Joshua said.
And then Gerardimo says, no, their excuse for being lackluster will never be forgiven.
They could have done all this at E3 and a separate event for Wii Music.
Interesting.
Very differing responses, too.
Those are almost like polar opposites, some of those.
So Nintendo definitely knows how to get people talking, if nothing else.
Brothers in Arms Hell's Highway KORG DS10 DS

Starting off with some really stupid stuff.
Pop Cutie Street Fashion Simulator from Koei.
It's coming out on the DS.
And on the Wii, we've got another party game collection.

Imagine Fashion Designer New York Onimusha The Essentials 3-Disc Collector Set Spanish Coach on PSP That is it.
Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock
That is all coming out on the Xbox 360.
I imagine it's also coming out on the PlayStation 3 as well.
Yes, it is.
That's really it for those two systems this week.
You've got to wait until next week for some of the bigger stuff.
However, let's take a look and see what's coming out on the Nintendo Wii.
Harvest Moon, I'm sorry, that's a US release.
Star Wars, The Force Unleashed comes out in Japan on the 9th.
So that's pretty awesome.
And let's check the PlayStation 2.
Same Guitar Hero Games, also Infinity Plus gets a release, as well as Daito Gaiken Koshiki Pachi Slot Simulator 24.
I don't think that's based off the TV series, though, just so you know.
Also, the PlayStation 2 version of Star Wars The Force Unleashed and a game called Will-O-Wisp.
Easter no Kiseki comes out as well.
Checking out the handheld systems to see what's coming out on there.
On the Nintendo DS, Snoopy DS.
Squeenix is putting out a Snoopy DS game.
Snoopy to Chugen Taichi Niiku comes out.
And yes, that is Snoopy as in Peanut Snoopy.
Because those characters are very popular over there still.
Nihongo de Asobo Kawaii
Konyu DS 2 comes out as well and Tetsudo Musume DS Terminal Memory comes out in both a regular and limited edition pack on the Nintendo DS and it looks like some game that centers around like stewards and stewardesses on airlines I don't know if it's some type of like drama turned game but there you go um
Also coming out on the Sony PSP, Mahjong Portable Jansu Battle is getting a price reduction.
That's really about it.
There is one other game coming out.
Looks to be a big one.
Macross Ace Frontier.
Sweet!
From Bandai Namco.
And one more.
Wait, wait, wait.
Ace Frontier?
I thought the series was Macross Frontier.
That's what they're calling it, Macross Ace Frontier.
And one other game that looks, I think it's like an Othello, oh no, it's Go.
It's a version of Go on your PSP.
It's Umewaza Ikari no Yahashi Ego, and I think that must be like a championship player that's on the cover.
So, she's pretty.
They're using her pretty face to sell just Go.
There you have it, your Japanese release dates.
Let's move back into some gaming news, DarkSakura.
Do we gotta?
Yes, we gotta.
Actually, this makes me very happy, and I'm going to download it depending on how it plays.
But they're bringing Pole Position to the iPhone.
That makes me very happy.
It's all cutesy 3D-y.
They look like little toy cars.
But it's...
Thank you for watching!
If you do play with moving the iPhone around, I would prefer that it be a little bit more natural and intuitive and not have to be held at some funky-ass bizarre angle.
But I'm going to give it a try.
I mean, it's $9.99, but I think that it might be worthwhile after a check arrives at my house.
All right.
And it's pole position.
It's old school.
Sadly, you don't really get the cool crashes in Pole Position.
It was just a little explosion graphic, but at least it was an explosion.
I remember the Pole Position cabinets from back in the day.
That was good times.
That was 80s gaming.
I love to sit down once.
You know that we actually built our first main cabinet out of a Pole Position.
Yeah, you still got it, right?
Somewhere, I think.
Well, now we've got our Reaper Pac-Man thing that we were going to put it in.
Cool.
Cool.
D3 is putting out a new game called Eat Lead.
It's kind of interesting the way they promoted this thing.
It stars a supposedly...
Old School Action Game Superhero Matt Hazard Weapons of Matt Destruction Altered Beast
Matt Hazard 3D, Fistful of Hazard, Hazmat Carts, and You Only Live 1370 Times.
Along with all this stuff, the game itself is actually going to be a 3D shooter.
Some interesting stuff to go along with that is
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
And it's got a script written by, I guess, this guy, David Ellis, who did, I guess, the Doctor Who serial, The Faceless Ones.
And the game itself is going to be... It kind of reminds me a little bit of Coated Arms, I guess.
Because the shooter game itself will take place across all sorts of different video game cliches.
But you can actually hack into the different characters and do different things to them.
So that's kind of neat.
And...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You know what I mean?
It sounds like a serious movie.
Some of those movies like Meet the Spartans, right?
Hey, it makes fun of all these great movies that came out in the past year, but it's just the dumbest thing you'll ever see.
There's a lot of games that have done it right.
I think TimeSplitters did the whole making fun of shooters games kind of right.
They actually just went really bizarre with that game, but it was fun.
That was the best part about it.
And I hope they come out with a new one because they released some teaser concept art for it this week as well.
But anyways, and it says he's making his next-gen comeback against all of his old enemies in a hilarious parody of the last 25 years of gaming.
I don't know.
It reminds me of something like a character that could have been one of the shareware characters from like Apogee or Epic Games.
It could be cool.
I guess we'll see.
It comes out in, I think, February.
All right.
We'll see.
One other thing that's coming out relatively soon, a Spore expansion.
That's right, because Spore wasn't enough.
Spore expansion, November 18th.
The Cute and Creepy Parts Pack.
It's only $20.
And, you know, there isn't much out there about what this is.
But, you know, if it's the Cute and Creepy Parts Pack, do you think it might be?
Oh, I don't know.
New parts for your creatures that you make?
Well, it was leaked on... Apparently, Amazon had the store pages up first, but now it's also being spotted on GameStop.
So, it is coming on November 18th.
Now, my question is digital downloads.
Surely, this has to be something they're going to offer us that as well.
I mean, why not, right?
You're willing to give them money.
No word as to how many parts we're talking about yet, but for $20, there better be quite a few.
Does the new expansion come with new DRM?
Because that'd be awesome.
I'd pay the $20 if it'll uninstall Securom.
No, I'm just kidding.
I shouldn't have to pay anything to get rid of that.
But you know what I'm saying.
so there you go spore expansion for those of you spore addicts and I think I said this during Bobby's show I don't know if I said this earlier in this show but some of the monsters in Silent Hill Homecoming kind of look like they were made in spore they're kind of creepy looking like arms off people's backs and stuff scary very scary are there any penis monsters?
There are no penis monsters.
Fail!
Why would you want to ruin Silent Hill with penis monsters?
You know, put penis monsters in a game that's already... Well, we've got Pyramid Heads.
That's good enough.
Exactly.
Is he just as prolific?
That's what I hear, but I haven't gotten to him yet.
I haven't played enough.
Okay.
So we'll see.
Yeah, VXJasonXV in chat says, No one bought Spore except for you.
Yeah, probably true.
Bobby did.
I'm probably the only one that actually bought it.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Bobby did.
DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
Well, first of all, I'd like to play the intro to this in just a second, which is why I late the one I did.
Okay.
Wait a second before you start it.
But the game is called Nekatsu Koko Dodgeball Boo, which is basically Super Dodgeball over here.
It's one of the Kunio games.
Nice.
Shall we have a little bit of intro?
We shall.
Let's see.
Do we want the whole Neo Geo splash screen and everything?
Why not?
That's what a Neo Geo sounds like when you press the on button.
Yep.
SUPER DODGE BALL
As you eliminate characters, basically a little angel takes them to the top of the screen and they go away.
But your life bar is basically how many teammates you have left.
So you defeat the other team by knocking out the teammates.
I mean, it is, you know, dodgeball.
So you have to keep knocking them down with the ball until they're just done.
And you've also got a special throw called your power shot that your team captain can use.
I have to clarify some things in chat, because I love this game.
I was very excited when DarkSakura picked it.
I really do love this game.
Ranma asked in chat, isn't this the same version as on NES, same characters?
No, it's not, because these are like custom characters, whereas the NES had the very general, you know, like, there are definitely related games.
They play very similarly.
They're both in the Kunio series.
The one that I linked here, though, is actually the... I believe the captain is the main character from what we got as River City Ransom.
Naketsu...
Hot Blooded High School Story or whatever.
But anyway, I like the special edition because honestly it has better music.
But in this one though, you start off by going around the world and you pick your team from different places.
But you start off with a game between Dallas and Chicago to show who's going to represent the United States.
And then you go around to England, Iceland...
China, Africa, although in later versions it was changed to Kenya, so you could run as fast as Kenyans.
And Japan!
But when you beat Japan, you actually get your World Cup given to you by a ninja.
So, um, yeah, what I was basically saying is that the game, um, was part of the, uh, the Kunio series, um, the first one being, um, Neketsu Koha Kunia-kun, which was what we got as, uh, Renegade over here.
And we know that the other one in the series was, um, River City.
But the way that the game starts is basically Kunio gets hit in the head with a dodgeball and his, uh, teammates go and beat him up.
There you go.
And the teams of Dallas and Chicago were actually the teams of Neketsu High School and Hanazono High School in the Japanese version.
So they, of course, modified it.
There was an NES version.
It actually was published by Technos, which was the one that released the arcade version.
But it's not even the same.
It's not.
I mean, from what I remember.
Okay, sorry.
I'm very passionate about my dodgeball games.
Um, it actually had six members.
You had the team captain and five others.
And they were all the same size instead of having your captain be, like, uber huge.
And, um, you could only have three players inside the court.
And you could arrange your positions, though, um, at the beginning of each match.
So you could, you know, make use of your different techniques.
Um...
You can actually adjust your energy, throwing power, throwing technique, and ball break, which is the curve.
You had agility, catching technique, and damage capacity.
There are also two extra teams.
There was India and USSR.
So, it had a lot of the same stuff, but had some pretty significant changes, I guess, to make it work on the NES.
We had to deal with a lot of that.
You remember the version of Strider?
It was based off of comic books, though.
Yeah, and Strider was also a totally different game.
The story was based off of comics.
It's not even the same type of game.
The Sega Strider was just a straight-up arcade action game, whereas...
I don't know, there was that more open world feel to the NES one.
Anyway, we've already done Strider.
Yeah, sorry.
I want to say this, because VXJsNextV in chat brings up a related game.
Was anyone else epic disappointed by Pirates vs. Ninjas Dodgeball?
Yes, I played the demo and I thought it was awful.
Awful, awful, awful.
And I quit in about five minutes.
And maybe I shouldn't judge something completely based on five minutes of gameplay, but honestly, with demos, that's about how long you have to sell me.
and it made me miss this game.
Ugh, that caught my breath for a second.
But there were other ones.
On X6800, it was released by SPS, which was a direct arcade port.
PC Engine had Neketsu Koko Dojibou Bupishi Bangaihen, which translates to Neketsu High School Dojibou Club Bonus PC Edition, that was released by Maxsoft Soft in 1990, which I've played this version a ton.
It's actually pretty cool.
You actually are having to fight off aliens disguised as dodgeball fighters.
There's a Windows version of the Famicom port that was done by BRS Corp in 2003.
PlayStation 2 had an arcade port that was put out by Hamster Corp as part of the Oretachi Gessenzoku lineup.
The Famicom version came out on Game Boy as part of the Kunio Kuniketsu Collection 1.
Naketsu Koko, Dodgeball Buu, Kyoteki, Dodgeball Soldier no Maki
Fearsome Rival, Tale of the Dodge Soldier, Kunio-kun no Dodgeball Daioh Zenin Shugo
France, Brazil, and Germany.
And then the one that we're having a video of here, which is the Kunio no Neketsu Dojibouro Densetsu, which is Kunio's Neketsu Dojibouro Legends, the Neo Geo release.
Actually, Technos did release this one, so that was pretty cool.
But you also have special moves, not just for your captain, but you have several main characters, and you have to do Street Fighter 2-like commands to get them to go off, like you saw the girls do their little attacks in there.
But you've got seven playable characters, and you also have them being the main characters from the Ketsu Kouha Kunioku, like in Renegade over here.
Um, also Super Dodgeball Advance, we, um, it wasn't actually a Kunio game.
So, but it was done with a lot of the same character style and gameplay.
It was put out by Million, haven't you?
But they also, the Million did do an official DS sequel called Chounaketsu Koko Kunio-kun Dodgeball Boo.
I just like saying it.
Wow.
and there's also Super Dodgeball Brawlers that's supposed to be by Axis.
It was supposed to come out.
Has it already come out?
Yeah.
I haven't played that one yet.
I played the Game Boy Advance one, but not that one.
I wonder if you can go in there and order food at a deli.
I wonder if it has booty, like in the spa.
Remember River City Ransom?
8-bit ass?
I'm still going to have to play the Japanese version of River City Ransom for you.
Just because it's so cool, they go into a little kusatsu and order food and they're all like doing little anime smiley things.
I always liked that the smiles were free.
I always liked that the smiles were free.
That was great.
Alright, anything else on Super Dodgeball?
Um, no.
Alright, there you have it.
Your classic game of the week, and a real classic, and yeah...
Don't bother with pirate images.
That's because I picked something I had already done before and forgot about it.
That's alright.
It's bound to happen.
How many weeks have we been doing this now?
At least 50.
We started it on episode 250.
Are we running out of classic games?
No!
Never!
I'm like, as I can think of a few we haven't done.
Like what?
You have never named one single solitary Commodore 64 game.
Guess what system Jamie didn't play.
Well, if you're ever out during a week, I will bring a Commodore 64 game in the picture.
I already know which one I'm going to do, too.
I already know.
Okay.
And it's one of those games people are going to go, WTF is he picking that game?
Because you better watch out or I'll start busting out the ColecoVision, yo.
All right.
Wait.
Mousetrap, Venture.
Alright, plenty more to come.
She's got enough to carry us through episode 400.
GORF.
I freaking love GORF.
I almost did GORF.
Okay, GORF is soon.
Maybe next week.
Little teaser for next week.
GORF.
Alright, anyhow.
that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio but hey stay tuned there's plenty more to come after a quick break and hey during the break tonight since there's not a lot of free commercials for the free break anymore because no one's sending me stuff but that's okay we got something even better giving stuff away if you were paying attention to last week's show
We're drawing the names right after this.
If you weren't paying attention to last week's show, you got about five minutes to find it because we're giving away some free Xbox 360 games right after the ES.
I said games, and I'll explain more a little bit about that right after the break.
But for you podcast listeners, you have to wait like five seconds for that little transition noise.
That's all you need.
But live listeners, you have to sit and listen to some music while we take a break, rest our voices, potty, drinks, all that stuff.
Well, not like drink from the potty.
That would be nasty, but forget it.
Alright, we'll be right back with more Orange Launch Radio right after this.
Alright, if you were listening last week at this part of the show where we usually do the free break, you know that we are doing a contest and we are giving away copies of Feeding Frenzy 2.
That's right, the sequel to Feeding Frenzy.
Available on the Xbox 360 is where we're giving away the game for.
Thank you to PopCap for sending along the codes so some of our listeners could try out the game.
So, thank you Random.org for choosing some numbers right out of our mailbox and our first winner tonight is...
The first winner of the code is QuickStix1 Yay!
Clap for QuickStix, dammit Yay!
There you go And winner number two of the code Yeah, that's right We're giving away two codes That's right, I lied last week That's right, I lied We actually have two codes to give away And the second winner of the code is ActDeft Yay!
There you go
There you have it.
Thank you to everybody that entered, and sorry to those that didn't win.
But you get nothing!
Go home!
Good day, sir!
Alright.
No, just kidding.
Sorry, guys.
Maybe next time.
Alright, so we'll get those codes sent off to our winners.
But for now, we're going to get back into Orange Lounge Radio.
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely Sunday evening, October the 5th, 2008, where we are right in the middle of episode number 297.
And of course we tape live every week, Sunday nights, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
And if you can't join us live though, you know you can always interact with us through the Twitter, through the live journal, the email bag that we'll get to later.
There's just tons and tons of ways.
We will.
Yeah.
You have to do the mailbag, sorry, like it or not.
Alright, but first we're going to do some more gaming news, right Loki?
Yes, that's correct.
In fact, little known fact, there is a Rock Band Track Pack Volume 2 coming out.
And this is not to be confused with another expansion disc we'll be talking about in a little bit.
But Volume 2 of course contains some tracks that were available on the download sites, both PlayStation Network and...
and on Xbox Live Marketplace.
The track list contains 20 different songs and includes Avenged Sevenfold, Afterlife, Blondie with Call Me, Weezer, El Scorcho, Devo, Girl You Want,
Maximo Park, Girls Who Play Guitars, Disturbed, Indestructible, Angels and Airwaves, It Hurts, The Cars, Just What I Needed, The Police, Message in a Bottle, Pixies, Monkey Gone to Heaven, Duran Duran with Rio, Motley Crue, Saints of LA, which I want to say that was a free track, so that's not really fair, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Simple Man, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Snow, Heyo, and...
I actually like that song.
Nine Inch Nails, The Perfect Drug, Fall Out Boy, This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race.
It's a goddamn arms race, actually.
But it's censored.
Yes.
Papa Roach, Time Is Running Out, Garbage, Why Do You Love Me,
JizzPriest, SmashingPumpkins0
and this will also have, I think, achievements as well because you can play this game standalone as well.
Well, that sucks because I have 10 of those songs already.
Is the game going to reimburse me for the 10 I already bought?
No.
Lame.
Well, you also have access to Xbox Live Marketplace.
I want achievements because I want achievements.
Well, I mean, you know, I don't really, but I'm being devil's advocate here.
I mean, why is that fair that somebody who waited to buy it gets to get a thousand more gamerscore?
This is really meant, I think, for the people that don't have live, and this is the only way that they can buy expansion packs.
but it says yeah included code allows these songs to be downloaded and played with Rock Band or Rock Band 2 via the PlayStation Network of course this is the PlayStation 3 version I'm looking at the back of so that's interesting though they can be downloaded for Rock Band 1 as well so hmm interesting but yeah this game you do not it does not require you to have the first game or the second game
Interesting.
I don't know, though.
Again, I already kind of own pretty much the whole game, so there you have it.
But for those who don't, and you know, to be honest, probably just buy them online.
Probably a little cheaper anyways.
Well, actually, no.
If it's $2 a song, that'd be about $40, and this is going to retail for $29.99, so you save a little bit of money.
I'm curious.
Is there anyone in our chat room right now that would be interested in buying this?
I bet not a one.
Just because everybody in our chatroom is obviously online enough where they're online chatting with our show that they probably don't, you know, their console's online too, I imagine.
I guess it's good for those that don't have it, or for those that are on the Wii where that's not really implemented yet, even though it's supposed to be.
Yeah, it will be, hopefully, with this one.
So maybe, you know, by the time the Wii version comes out, because I think this is not scheduled to come out until November.
It's around the same time as the Wii version, so...
All right, well, that's not the only expansion for Rock Band coming soon.
But here's the interesting thing.
The other expansion that's coming is not something that you can already download.
It's a brand new track pack.
It's ACDC Live is coming.
Sweet.
Here's the weird thing, though.
It's a Walmart and Sam's Club exclusive because I believe there's a new ACDC album that is an exclusive.
So go figure.
And for those of you in foreign countries that are pouting about that, hey,
Guess what?
Also for Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in early December.
So they didn't forget about you unless you're not in one of those countries.
And they did forget about you.
All the songs from the disc, you can use them in Rock Band and Rock Band 2 using an export authentication code.
But here's the thing.
You can only use that once per disc.
And I think that's the same with this track pack 2 as well.
I think it's only once per disc.
Because, I mean, come on.
They're smart enough to know, hey, they're just going to buy it and download it for five bucks to all their friends.
You can only do that with Rock Band 1.
And, by the way, that $29 price point is only for the PlayStation 2 version.
If you want the fancier ones for a 360, PS3, or Wii, $39.88 is the magic price.
That's fucked up.
November 2nd for... Here's the weird thing.
Again, if you want it on Wii, though, you've got to wait.
November 16th is the date for you.
360, PS3, and PS2, you get it on November 2nd.
That's ACDC Live.
And apparently the game has its own set of achievements, which is very much in line with the same thing Loki was talking about.
Although, funny enough, I'm seeing a lot of news this week on the blogs about this.
I'm not seeing a damn thing about what you just told us.
Is that because you told us a secret or what?
No, I don't know why this isn't out there.
I mean, it's going to be available soon.
It's just I guess maybe it's not as exciting as ACDC.
I guess not.
But there was a lot of confusion, I know, with at least us selling this.
You know, it's like, is this the same damn thing as the Walmart one?
Right.
But no, it's actually something completely different.
Interesting.
And I was going to say, probably the reason why it's not coming out on the 16th for the Wii is because Rock Band 2 is going to be the only one you'll be able to download that one for, I think.
Or to do download play on.
All right.
Well, there you have it.
Coming soon.
If you like ACDC, get ready to ring your hell's bells.
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
Actually, no, wait, no, that doesn't make any sense.
I was going to say, well, that doesn't make any sense.
That's coming out on the 16th, and that means that you'll be able to save stuff to your SD member cards, but I forgot games already allow you to do that.
It's channels that will be coming in 2009.
Right, and it's 2009.
Yeah.
So there you have it.
All right, we'll move on.
More gaming news.
Well, for anyone who played the first episode for Penny Arcade and liked it, the second one is going to be cheaper.
Hot Head Games is actually listening to consumer feedback and is going to be releasing the game for 1,200 Microsoft points, which is...
10 pounds 20 pence in pounds.
It'll be $14.95 US dollars on a PC, which is 7 pounds 50 in the UK.
$15 is still expensive for that game anyways.
It's ridiculous to charge $20 for it.
I'm not sure if I want to buy the sequel.
Well, I'm still interested.
I haven't finished the demo of the first one yet, to be honest.
I don't know.
I never finished the first one.
I got bored with it too quick.
Played other things.
Oh well.
a bunch of titles and a few unannounced titles which we'll just have to be surprised about but some of the things they're going to be showing off Sengoku, Basara, Battle Heroes looks like Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Fantasy Dissida or Dissida Final Fantasy I like how they have Isn't that that awesome looking fighting game?
Yeah that's the fighting game for the Final Fantasy fighting game.
I want to see more on that Ratchet and Clank, Maru High Mission Ignition
that's kind of a cool name Bleach, Soul Carnival, Pot of Pond 2
Shin, uh, Stapatapon, Shin, um, Sengoku, Musou, or Musoui, I guess, uh, Multirade.
I think that's, uh, that's not the Gundam one.
Hmm.
And, uh, let's see what else we have here.
Like, uh, new Idolmaster game, Idolmaster SP.
Awesome.
Mobile Suit Gundam, Gundam vs. Gundam.
Tales of the World, Radiant Mythology 2, 3 unannounced Sony titles, Guitar Hero, Legend of the Rock, FIFA 09, Street Fighter 4, Resident Evil 5, Luminous Supernova, Metal Gear Online, Way of the Samurai 3, Sonic World Adventure,
SoCalm Confrontation, PlayStation Home, that's not a game, and MotorStorm 2, LittleBigPlanet, Resistance 2, SmackDown vs. Raw 9, Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2, and R2 Ultimate Ninja Storm.
GS68 in the chatroom asks, Luminous Supernova?
I believe that was a game that came up earlier.
It's the new PS3 Network Luminous game, right?
Yes, yes, that's the one.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
for a company to show games that are already out.
I mean, hell, when we went to E3 one year, they were still showing off Oblivion.
Granted, they were still releasing download content on a regular basis at Bethesda, but whatever.
Konami is also showing off World Soccer Winning 11 2009.
Gensu Suikoden...
Actdeft, Tikris, Castlevania Judgment, Silent Hill Homecoming, Chaotic Eden, Tongari Bushi, Tumaho no 365, Nichi
Your guess is as good as mine as to what that is.
Also showing friendly company to Konami, Hudson will be showing some titles on the floor.
Some Wii titles that they'll be showing on the Tokyo Game Show floor.
Fishing Master World Tour, Marble Saga Kororimpa.
So now it's another, it looks like a new Kororimpa game coming exclusively to the Wii.
It's new levels, four-person multiplayer gameplay apparently is going to be in this new game.
You can actually use your Mii this time around.
I'll tell you what, the first Kororimpa game, hours of entertainment by making the little Marba the panda ball and changing the sound effects to the farting noise every time it would hit the wall.
That's what the game sounds like, it's hours of entertainment because we all are seven at heart.
But here's the thing, now they've built like a story around it, because the first game was just kind of like, eh, just kind of go, but now they're-
I mean, come on, stop beating around the bush.
Just make a new Marvel Madness game.
Okay, wait, hold on, though.
Hold on, though.
You've got to listen to this story, okay?
In this game, you are going to go on a quest with a character named Anthony the Ant, and Anthony the Ant is searching for the golden sunflower.
and you guide Anthony's marble around the ant world and you get items that will help you reach the golden sunflower and you will help save Anthony's colony.
Also, many more dangering mazes, amazing widgets and gadgets to help your little ant friend out.
Oh, and one more thing.
We connect 24 capability.
You can make your own stages in edit mode.
Kind of neat, huh?
That's what the first game should have been.
That's alright though.
We forgive him.
Hey, one more game to announce from Hudson.
It's going to be a Tokyo Game Show.
Not on the Wii, but on PlayStation Network.
Bomberman Ultra.
Bomberman Ultra.
8-player multiplayer online.
14 different arenas.
4-player local gaming.
You can customize your own Bomberman character.
50 different costumes.
Adding up to 150,000 possible combinations.
Of which 149,000 probably look like shit.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Well, I think we have at least a couple listeners who are going.
I do believe so.
I've seen it around the Twitter, so I expect many pictures.
There's actually certain things that I would like to see, but one that actually I'm very interested in that's only going to be a video only for PlayStation 3 is the game that was the new game done by the creator of Katamari Damashii, which is Keita Takahashi.
It's called Nobi Nobi Boy, and really he just looks sort of green and cylindrical with the prince face.
It's like if they made the Prince of the Cosmos or whatever with a wiener dog.
I know, right?
But I would love for someone to get out a video camera and tape me some footage of that because there hasn't been anything really specific out on it yet except some people playing with something that looked like a dildo.
And I will send you a dollar if you dress up your wiener dog like Noby Noby Boy for Halloween.
One whole dollar?
One whole dollar.
That's pure U.S.
currency for you.
There's also another game there that I want someone to tape me footage of so I can see it.
And that's, um, don't laugh.
Anpanmanto Touch de Waku Waku Training.
What is that?
Anpanman.
Huh.
He's cute and made of bread.
Alright.
But this is some stuff that's actually going to be video only.
It's Nobi Nobi Boy, Galaga Legends for... I'm sorry, Legions for Xbox 360.
On Wii is One Piece Unlimited Cruise Episode 1, Kotoba No Puzzle, Mojipitan Wii Deluxe, and Progolf for Saru.
Doesn't Saru mean monkey?
Anyway.
On DS, the video-only ones are Dr. Slump, Arale-chan, Dragon Ball Origins, and Anpanman To Touch, DewakuWaku Training.
Someone tape it for me.
We also have on PSP, Idle Master SP, Wandering Star, and Missing Moon.
PlayStation 2 is Super Robot Taisen Z, and PC, Legend of Galactic Heroes, which is pretty cool.
There are some playable things, though, things of interest.
Like what?
Like whatever happy dance collection is, I guess.
I don't know.
Soul Eater, Medusa's Conspiracy.
Soul Eater is a pretty freaking cool manga, what I've seen of it.
There's also, yes, Precure 5, Gogo, Zen and Shugo, Dream Carnival.
There's also some Tales of Hearts stuff going on.
I really do want to see Macross Ace Frontier.
And there's also Tales of the Radiant World Mythology 2.
Also on PSP.
Alrighty.
Well, cool.
What about Sega?
It's just listed by systems.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
GameStop has now bought a brand new chain in France for $700 million, and they have gained 332 stores out of the deal.
And apparently...
I don't know, the two stores that they bought, I guess, the Gaming Guild and it's Navigators.
I guess those are a chain.
Oh, Micromania, I'm sorry, is the French company.
Micromania, never heard of them, but of course I don't live in France, so.
Isn't that kind of scary, though?
They're seriously trying to be like the McDonald's of fucking gaming.
Yeah, beware, kids.
You will be assimilated into the GameStop collective, apparently.
It's just a matter of time.
I don't know about you guys, but when I hear about GameStop taking over the world, it makes me a little bit angsty, especially for the independent shops out there.
And when I get angsty, we play the mean music and say mean things.
and Fuse of the Week time, DarkSakura.
F you to me for forgetting one of the stories that I had to do just a moment ago.
And F you to Rob for not actually telling me the story.
I tried to drop a hint.
Yeah, but I'm a little pissed off right now.
I'm a lot pissed off.
Why?
Because I need my... I hurt.
Aww.
So F you goes to my hip hurting like really, really freaking bad.
And F you to...
Stuff in general.
Damn that stuff.
I know, stuff just sucks.
Loki.
I feel like people that run red lights with their cars, I don't know, they think it's fun or something, or they just say forget it, you know.
Anyways, so yeah, there was a guy today, we're driving, and he just, you know, right turn on a red, and just kind of didn't even stop, just whoo!
I'm going and then he pulled right in front of me and went super slow just to add insult to injury and then there's numerous days where I see people just blowing through red lights well after they've turned red because they're in a hurry well good, I hope you murder somebody and end up in jail forever and sued for all the money that you have all few bucks of it and you rot in hell that's it
I want to say F you to the Italian dinner I had last night, which was not at Olive Garden.
I went to another place around here.
And man, I don't know what it was about the food.
It was bad or something because it's like World War III was occurring in my colon.
It was really, really horrible.
So F you to that.
I wonder if I ate uncooked meat or something.
It was pretty terrible.
I'm going to do my story now.
You sure can do your story now.
This is the list of stuff that Sega is going to have at Tokyo Game Show.
For PlayStation 3 is Yakuza 3, Bayonetta, Sonic Unleashed.
For Wii is 428, Bleach vs. Crusade, the arrangement of Haruhi Suzumiya, another Haruhi...
I like Haruhi.
That's really cool.

I'm like, I don't like tactics games.
There's the Haruhi game, Blazer Drive, World Destruction, Sakatsuku Dia's Touch and Direct, Kaete Oboeru Doragana, Garnet Chronicle, Crimson Gen, Saga on PSP, Hatsune Miku, Project Diva.
You know what that is, right?
Virtual Idol Nice Yep And Phantasy Star Portable And PC is getting Internet Adventure Internet Adventure The internet is an adventure It is an adventure Dude, that's okay I want the Hatsune Miku game I totally want the Hatsune Miku game
Alright.
Lots to look forward to at Tokyo Game Show.
And a follow-up to a story we had last week.
Remember how we talked about that the co-op was going to be delayed via a patch?
Well, suddenly there's some backtracking this week from the infamous Peter Molyneux, the Lionhead CEO.
He is saying that the co-op actually might be available at launch day.
So now they're kind of going back and forth.
But this was said in some video at a game festival that was going on in Paris.
He said that Fable 2 will have the online co-op at launch, but he can't confirm that.
But the ambition is there But just in case, be prepared for disappointment I'm not sure how exactly I'm supposed to take that It's only about a week of disappointment I know, it'll be all over within a week Which, quite frankly, I have enough games to play anyway I don't fucking need another one But I do still kind of want Fable 2, I gotta admit You need to play Saints Row 2 No, I don't Because you can make all sorts of tranny characters Oh, because that's why I play games, Loki To make tranny characters Exactly!
Who doesn't play games?
That was a sexist comment
How is that a sexist comment?
Tranny is both sexist.
Fable 2 is getting a collector's edition, but it's slowly slipping away.
Some of the cards that were supposed to be in it, the figure and all this stuff, the box itself is not actually going to be there.
Oh, but the cards will.
The cards will be there.
But here's the other weird thing.
The cards are going to be there in a downloadable PDF format.
So you can print your own damn cards.
I'm getting the feeling nobody pre-ordered the collector's edition and that's why they're suddenly having to do this.
I don't know what it is.
Did you?
Yeah.
How do you feel about the fact that it's suddenly like disappearing?
I didn't give a shit about the cards or the DVD or anything.
I just wanted like...
Thanks for watching!
No, I'm buying it now so I can play it after I'm done with Saints Row 2, which will be for a while.
My friend wants to play Fable 2 co-op, so that sounds kind of like fun.
That'll be fun.
But then again, I want to play Saints Row 2 co-op, so I don't know.
Henderson Ma'am says, I wanted the Master Chief outlet.
Is that the thing they're getting with the pre-order?
Yes, that comes with the pre-order still.
There's a lightsaber type of weapon or something that you get.
There's also some additional dungeon or something that's coming.
That's about it.
And you get like a bonus DVD of behind the scenes crap.
I kind of wanted the figurine for my desk and that would have been kind of cool.
I also have a regular version on order as well in case I decide at the last minute I don't want, you know.
Well, I have it on order at work.
I mean, I can cancel at any time.
There's no $5 deposit for me, so.
Cancel at any time.
Why don't you order like 50 of them and then cancel them all?
Or will they get mad?
They get mad at that.
Well, that is coming out soon.
Hey, speaking of the Master Chief outfit, completely random off-topic story.
I went to a party store here locally yesterday and you know everybody's gearing up for Halloween, right?
Did you know they're selling a Halo 3 branded Master Chief outfit?
Have you seen that?
I have seen that.
I was at party stores yesterday.
Do you know what's really sad?
Is I was considering buying it.
Because I'm kind of pathetic.
Well, it would be fun, wouldn't it?
Dress up as a video game character.
Especially one as well-known as Master Chief.
What?
Um, what?
Um?
You know tons of cosplayers.
You wouldn't have a problem.
True.
I could save that for an army convention.
Our manager in Dallas, he has a kick-ass Halo.
I think he actually bought one of those Halo costumes.
Like, a custom-made one or something.
He has, like, literally the full outfit.
Rob Chico is the king of the universe.
Oh, the king of the cosmos?
That'd be hilarious.
Actually, we're talking about doing that as a Rocky Horror Gold scene at some point, if you even know what I'm talking about.
Deekman in chat, live in our chatroom, chat.orangeonstranger.com says, I saw that at Walmart yesterday here in Canada.
So it's even at Walmart.
Dan's shadow is going to be Dr. Horrible.
That's a pretty good outfit.
You know what I'm hearing is going to be a really popular outfit this year, I heard?
Sarah Palin.
One of my friends is going to Sir.
Deakman says a lot of people won't cancel it regardless.
Going back to the pre-order, speaking of that.
There you go.
Alright, so Fable 2.
I'll buy it.
It'll just be one of those games I only have 30 minutes to play, so go figure.
Oh, Deekman says my wife is going as Grunty from Banjo-Kazooie.
You know what I saw?
Someone made a costume or at least a guide on how to make it.
They have a Sackboy costume that someone made.
Oh yeah, I saw that.
I think I might actually want to make that.
I don't have a costume to wear and my wife is dressing up as Darthina Vaderina.
and pink Barbie-ish secret girlfriend of Darth Vader.
She's going as an awful Mary Sue.
She's literally like, you know, she's dressing, or it kind of looks like her cape's going to be bedazzled and stuff like that.
It's ridiculous, but funny.
SSJ100 Matt says, I'm thinking of going as the Hebrew Hammer.
That would be funny.
We'll have to ask this question again on our Twitter or something right before Halloween.
You know what?
What?
If it wasn't so freaking hot to wear and didn't need to be taken in a bit, I'd wear my Organization XIII costume from YaliCon the other year.
I'm probably going to recycle my Jack Skellington costume from last year, because seriously, I paid good money for it.
I need to wear it more than once.
You know, I actually, though, I really want someone... I need to redo the claw.
I could do my Baiken costume.
Oh, fun.
Show off my boobs.
All right.
How about you show off the next gaming story?
How about I do just that?
You do it.
Well, for anyone who's been interested in The Force Unleashed, you're getting some treats.
You're getting Luke and Obi-Wan, which is pretty freaking cool.
You're also getting Ki-Adi-Mundi and Kit Fisto.
That sounds like a porn star name.
Yeah.
Kid Fisto!
Fisting.
Wow.
It's actually a pretty cool looking character.
But also, there's supposed to be new costumes and a new mission.
One for the Jedi Temple and the apprentice will learn more about his father, blah blah blah.
So you get more stuff.
There's no dates left for the download content packs, but it will be posted at some point, I guess.
Pretty game.
Yeah, the Sackboy costume looks really easy to make.
It's like a sweatshirt and a garbage bag, or a garbage pail.
You should wear a Kit Fisto costume.
and I'll see you next time.
so uh yeah apparently all that drama with uh EA trying to buy take two is made take to say hey you know what we're just gonna be a bachelor for a long time how about that so they've decided that they're not going to we need a little me time they're not gonna mate with any other game companies right now or merge with any they're not we're gonna return your phone calls
They're not calling you back.
They're like, you know... They just want the one night stand.
They're going to go, bye.
It's not you.
It's you.
They're like, you know, when they're getting up in the morning and whoever they're in bed with is saying, call me.
Take two is just like, sure.
I'll call you something.
Alright, well, too bad for those that were interested in Take-Two, I suppose.
But, you know, good for them, I guess, sticking to it if they want to stay independent.
Hey, on completely different news, this is a game, another, god, another freaking game I want to get this year.
I'm just not going to have time for it.
The Last Remnant.
The Last Remnant, you know, it's coming out worldwide.
Japan, of course, one place that they really need to sell more Xbox 360s, even though, you know, they've had a lot of good luck and some turnaround thanks to Tales of Vesperia.
They're gonna try to do that even more with The Last Remnant.
It's a special Xbox 360 bundle that's gonna be coming out in Japan.
This box is gonna come with a DVD remote, the game, a faceplate, and a soundtrack CD.
That's $331 for all that shit together.
It's about $30 off of what it would cost separately.
And they're hoping that's going to push them over the million Xbox 360 sold in Japan mark.
Because that's pretty big.
And again, Tales of Vesperia has been very good at helping them get there.
A little bit Infinite Undiscovery, too, as well.
The Last Remnant, by the way, though, is not solely on the Xbox 360.
It will be coming out on the PlayStation 3, but later.
So Xbox 360 does get a little bit of an exclusive window.
So there you go.
That's a lot of stuff, too.
So if you're waiting in Japan, now might be a good time.
Alright, now's a good time for us to go and open the email bag.
Every week you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we pick a few of our favorites to read here on the program and that's what we're going to do right now.
DarkSakura's going to dive in the mail bag and read some emails.
How many emails do we have tonight?
Five!
Alright.
Let's make it quick.
Five emails.
Here we go.
The first one comes from Daniel.
I swear this is going to be my last email regarding Warhammer Online.
I'm calling all MMO gamers to join the order on the Iron Fist server.
I'm trying to get a guild together, but because the hours I work 2pm until 11pm Monday through Saturday Thank you for telling us your hours, I will find out where you work.
It's becoming difficult.
I have a close group of experienced MMO gamers I'm going to stalk the Iron Fist.
on this server already, but we have all work similar hours, so none of us are in-game during peak hours.
The game really requires you to be in a guild to get some extra bonuses.
P.M.
Ballhair?
With three L's.
Okay, it's B-A-L-L-L-H-A-I-R
or PunkyDunch if interested I like how these guys are sending us an email about look we're on this roleplay server and we really want our guild to be taken seriously we can't figure out why people won't join our guild
and play this game with us.
Maybe it's our work hours.
I don't know.
Please send a message to Ball Air.
Rob is turning red in the face.
This is cute.
Rob.
Look.
Rob.
I'm not.
Rob.
Punky dunch.
That one's funny too.
Do you think that person might have just made this whole story up just to get us to say those names on here?
I think possibly that whole thing was a trap to get you to say ball hair.
You know what?
I'll say ball hair anyway.
Ball hair!
I'll also say sweaty balls.
Alright.
I am not afraid to go there, Rob.
Alright, I know.
You live there.
You own a house there.
P.S.
LittleBigPlanet is insane.
On the surface, it's a cute platformer, but once you dive into the level builder, you will be hooked.
It is difficult but addictive.
One of my favorite things about it is the ability to borrow someone's creations.
If someone else makes a really cool figure or building, you can borrow it and put it on your own stages.
Look on YouTube for some really cool creations.
The body level and LittleBigColossus are some of the more popular levels out there.
That's from Daniel, a.k.a.
Ball Hair.
Dan's in chat right now and says, no, it's real, I swear.
So you should sign all your letters, Ball Hair.
He is Ball Hair the Dwarf.
Ball Hair.
Come on, it's awesome.
No, dude, it is awesome.
That's the whole thing.
It's just really funny.
I'm sorry.
Just because the whole setup of the email and everything.
So we have to have fanfare for you.
Ball Hair the Dwarf.
Can I move on?
Yes.
Hi, folks!
I just had a few questions for you.
Maybe you might have some possible answers and slash or feedback.
Considering how retro gaming is on consoles nowadays, as well as indie games, see Everyday Shooter, Mega Man 9, X-Men, etc.
for reference.
I have decided to make my own games for both the 360 and PS3.
The catch is, the last game I made was a borderline pornographic mod of an Apple IIe edutainment game originally called Turtle Trot.
What classes should I take, or alternatively, what books should I read and what programming languages should I learn?
Are most games using the C languages or a variation thereof?
Dude, I have no fucking clue.
To actually learn how to write games?
You should write them in BASIC.
And release it on the TI computer.
Actually, that's not a bad point to email.
I'll tell you, when I was in school studying computer science, C++ was where you started.
It's one of those things where you have to start somewhere.
I mean, programming languages aren't that much different.
I mean, they are and they aren't.
The way you learn...
Shut up.
The way you learn languages is that whole logic, if, then, and building flowcharts in your mind.
And any language is going to be a foot in the door at that.
But if you want something to be practical and learn something, you go with C or the languages that are really out there.
Rob, I have to say something.
What's that?
Yeah, my flowchart is in my mind.
There you go.
As for the rest of the email?
Yes.
In case you're wondering, I'm looking to develop games that have the look and feel of old school 8 and 16-bit arcade and console games.
This catches that A, they're simple to pick up and learn, B, difficult to master, C, fun, and D, they have my goofy, corny, off-the-wall sense of humor injected into them.
An example would be an NPC in an adventure game complaining about being forced to pace back and forth in a certain path and saying the same thing over and over again to adventurers.
In a fit of rage or fed up, he declares that he quits and orders the gaming gods to take his job and shove it.
That came from Spazinator, by the way.
Wait, what was the question in there?
What games have that type of... That's what he said his goals for making the games.
Oh, I see.
I don't know.
Loki, you're probably the closest thing we have on staff to a programmer.
What are your thoughts on this?
For someone that doesn't program, I'm pretty good.
You hack and stuff, but I don't know.
Do you have any thoughts on this?
He hacks with a butter knife.
Um...
Well, I mean, if you're trying to get into it professionally, I guess, then, like, C would be good, or, like, Visual Basic or something like that.
Um...
probably if you're just doing it for fun and you want to do something like that there's like GameMaker 7 that I don't know if you've seen there was that Mario game that had like the Mega Man levels and all that like crazy shit in it that was made with GameMaker 7 so you can actually make full like games out of it and distribute them to your friends and that kind of thing and that's what you're interested in you know doing um
But yeah, that's pretty much it.
That's Bobby.
I don't know.
Good luck to you.
Pass off the blame.
Next email?
Yes, next email.
Hello cast of OLR, especially Loki.
DarkSakura, Loki,
If you have a Guitar Hero controller for PS2 and another system that's wired, you can get a converter that will allow you to plug in these controllers and play.
Lastly, if you decide to get this game, at first it sucks because the game itself has a lot of bugs, which makes it bad, and it looks nothing like Guitar Hero 3, but if you...
Get it, download the Elyrian mod because it's designed to make it look and feel just like Guitar Hero 3.
The best thing about this game is that you can add your own songs and download ones made by other people.
Lastly, all of the real gaming companies like Activision and Harmonix have released songpacks for each of their games that are exactly the same as the real ones.
That makes me laugh because Guitar Hero 3 is on PC, but you can just download the songs for Farts on Fire and play them for free, so please check it out.
This is from Blade 3.
P.S.
Sorry this email is so long.
Thanks for reading it.
P.S.S.
I hope I passed the grammar Nazis test.
No, you didn't because you didn't punctuate that sentence.
And the last one was a run-on sentence and also Nazis spelled N-A-Z-I.
um not with a t they also have a game called guitar fun on the wii that's basically the same thing and you can use that for like a homebrew stuff plus now the new version has usb support so you can use your usb guitars uh i think for rock band um and then you can also use usb keyboards if you want to um and that's also available and i think you can do two player on that you can also do uh
May I continue?
you may, I shall
Wait, is that the old, old-ass game?
It's the one I mentioned.
No, I mentioned this last week.
Yes, it's a remake of Pipe Dream.
Okay, I was going to say, that game is like... God, they had the game on the Commodore 64.
That shit is old school.
I mean, it's a very simple puzzle.
It's like Tetris.
It's also like Bioshock's hacking.
Ah, yes, yes, it is.
Well, to continue.
Sorry.
I'd never heard of the video game My Boyfriend, but it came out this week.
I'm sure it can't be as bad as Imagine Babies, or whatever horrible crime against grammar Ubisoft perpetrated against the English language while concocting the spelling of that game's name.
And yes, you did spell it correctly.
And regardless, the game is called My Boyfriend, and apparently the game lets the player, as a teenage girl, have her first boyfriend.
Now that I haven't heard of.
Maybe I can play as a boy and that would make it the most awesome game ever.
While your news is usually awesome and definitely entertaining to listen to, I just wanted to point out these two horrible omissions in your release sources.
Thanks, Hephaestus.
I mentioned Pipe Mania last time we did releases and yes, I did mention the exact same stuff.
It's a remake of Pipe Dream and it's the same thing as the hacking in it.
I remember specifically saying that because I have to sell this crap.
I think I kind of want to play that one though because it makes me think of Tokimeki Girlside.
Well, if you want to... Let's see.
If you want to... What other games are people going to accuse me of forgetting to mention?
Gravity, which is a game that's going to be coming out that's kind of like the... Was it Pocket Physics game that's out now?
Dude, that sounds cool.
There's also... I like physics.
There's also a crappy Rubik's World game that's coming out later on that's like Rubik's Cube stuff, but they're trying to make it expanded and it's going to be like a puzzle game and stuff.
Um...
I'm trying to think of what else that people might be remotely interested in.
I don't know.
I just mentioned everything.
I don't miss a thing.
A face that's in chat right now says, by the way, my boyfriend is totally a bad GTA clone.
I want to say there was a story about this a long, long time ago on the show.
The company that made my boyfriend apparently also made a PC game called So Blonde.
DarkSakura
And us now.
Because if you had moved out here, you would never have met me.
If not for my husband, I would never have been the internet celebrity I am today.
There you go.
Or as Actdeft calls him, Edan.
He facilitates my rock and roll lifestyle.
Or lack thereof.
So, last email?
Yes, last email.
Dear OLR, oh, we're dear.
I would just like to say that yesterday's show, the 28th, was my first time listening live while interacting with the chat room.
Thank you for watching!
if this gets read on air this statement needs to be made if you love the podcast and only listen via the podcast you're doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing all the OLR has to offer there's also some post show goodness to be found on occasion which is definitely also worth your time well thank you
God, you'd think we'd paid somebody to write that.
That's very sweet.
I know we didn't because we don't have any money.
Exactly.
We used that all up in Seattle.
At the risk of sounding like a complete suck-up, I'm going to end the email.
But first, I would just like to remind the OLR staff how awesome they are and reiterate that every listener should go to the chat room sometime.
I know I will be listening live and chatting every week that I'm able.
So here's hoping everyone listens live sonic
and Mediate.
By the way, I have to commend your spelling and your grammar.
It's beautiful.
It's freaking gorgeous.
Wow, a rare compliment.
Seriously.
See, that's how you get DarkSakura to kiss your ass is kiss her ass.
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I actually, because, you know, I'm used to, and it's kind of hard.
I don't catch it so much in myself, but I catch it in other people's writing because I've gotten kind of used to being the beta reader.
But, wow.
This is actually very, very well done.
Thank you.
This is actually a good question in chat.
Whatever happened to the midday show for the European listeners?
We still need to do that.
At some point.
It's probably realistically not going to happen until after 300.
I don't know how much I want to get into this now until I know some details, but I'm going to be off for several shows in a row because I'm having surgery.
If you've been listening to the show, I just don't know when.
The when is the big question mark.
Bob's having a pancreactomy.
No, not, I, well, no.
And then he's having a duodenumectomy.
But if I get the gallbladder out, which is the surgery I'm having.
And then he's having a stomachectomy.
Shut up.
And I'm getting a face job.
But no, I'm going to have the gallbladder out, which is very common.
I'm sure plenty of our listeners have had it done.
I'm not that worried about it, except for the fact it's just surgery.
But, you know, there's going to be recovery time, and I have no OLR for me while I'm recovering.
So probably at least two, if not three weeks, I'm going to be out.
So I don't know what's going to happen to the show during that time.
The return of Pump Up the Volume.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
But, yeah, something will happen.
But I am not missing episode 300.
We will put this damn show on hiatus at 299 if I'm having the surgery in two weeks, which I don't think I am.
We'll figure out something.
Yeah, we'll figure something out.
We always do.
We'll bring the computer in to Rob's bedside.
Live from surgery.
Live from my bedroom.
There you go.
We'll put your surgery on Justin TV.
That would be just, it would be almost Shakespearean to have episode 300 from the hospital.
I don't know why.
We should totally, seriously, webcast your surgery.
I'm not Katie Couric, for fuck's sake.
Alright.
Seg says, need a guest host.
Well, we always want guests.
So come up, be on the show.
I think Bobby should fly out here.
Alright.
So that's the end of the segment tonight, yes?
For the mailbag?
Yes.
Alright, we want to thank our sponsor for tonight's... Let's fly Tiara back out here.
We want to thank tonight's sponsor for our mailbag segment.
Sauce is going to be our guest host.
Give it up for tonight's sponsor, everybody.
Oh, hair!
The dwarf!
I don't get it.
No, just kidding, I do get it.
Alright, good.
I was going to say, don't make me explain it to you.
Alright, let's move on.
A couple more gaming news stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line, and hopefully we'll get some calls.
So, there's plenty of ways to save money with your car insurance, but there may be a new way soon, especially if you're of the old variety.
Apparently, there is Allstate, and they're, I guess, testing a new...
DarkSakura,
Also kind of just different reflex tests and that kind of stuff.
And they're seeing if the performance in that game correlates to how safe the drivers are.
And if they find that to be true, then you may get discounts based on how well you perform in a game.
Or how often you play said game.
I hope they do the tests on Crazy Taxi.
Crazy Taxi.
I'm ready to save some crazy money.
That's like a future Geico commercial right there.
Wow, who knew some video games might actually save me money in the future?
Do you think this is really going to happen though?
Or is this like one of those things where like so-and-so says something to so-and-so and now it's like fact?
It's less of a game, more of like software.
I wouldn't even call it a game.
All right.
Hey, we are going to be opening the Skype line very soon to your calls.
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio so you definitely should be adding us on there.
But first, we have one more story for you tonight about, what else, the most important video game of the 21st century.
Of course I mean SingStar ABBA.
It is being released on December 2nd.
And the track listings have been announced.
There are going to be 20 tracks on the PlayStation 2 for $30.
25 tracks on the PlayStation 3 for $40.
And yes, Dancing Queen's on both.
Some of the highlights from both track lists.
Chiquiquita, Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man After Midnight, Take A Chance On Me, SOS, Dancing Queen, Fernando, I Do I Do I Do,
Knowing Me, Knowing You, The Winner Takes It All, Mamma Mia, Money, Money, Money, and of course, Waterloo.
Some of the exclusives on the PlayStation 3 that you will not see on the PlayStation 2, if you were curious, I know I was.
Under Attack, When All Is Said And Done, which by the way is my favorite of the song ever, and Head Over Heels, and Happy New Year, and The Day Before You Came are the five.
So that goes out to all two of you that care about that news.
But I'm telling you, this game is going to be epic.
I care.
In so many ways.
I care too.
When's it coming out in the U.S.?
December 2nd.
You know what, Rob?
I might have to pick it up.
I'm going to pick it up.
My PlayStation 3, I told America, and the world, I told the world, not just America, we have listeners all over the world, I told the world, I will buy the PlayStation 3 when that one game comes out that I have to have.
And it is coming December 2nd.
It's not even Final Fantasy.
Well, and there's LittleBigPlanet too.
But there's SingStar ABBA.
I can't speak for DarkSakura
and I certainly can't speak for Loki.
Yes, you can.
And Loki says no.
But I will do a Justin TV special even if I have to get my fabulous friends over here to play the game with me like Extifer and Irene and Victoria and some of the fabulous friends.
Get me drunk enough, I'll do it.
Now, Deekman asks a good point.
Why can't these just be DLC for the current SingStar?
That actually isn't a bad question.
But something as momentous as ABBA deserves its own release.
Don't you think?
I mean, shit.
If a little podunk band like ACDC, a little band that nobody's heard of called Aerosmith, this no-name thing out of the Bay Area named Metallica, if they can all get their games, why can't ABBA have their own damn game?
I still have to give you your record.
Yes, you do.
When Ranma was here, he got Rob an ABBA album.
That's amazing, by the way.
Got him Super Trooper.
That's amazing.
That's what's going in the blank spot.
Pinball.
All right.
Maybe we'll just rearrange.
I mean, some of these, I mean, Poppin' Music 11.
How old is that?
That can come now.
But it's still cute.
You should give that to me.
The other one is Autograph.
You know this Dear Friends poster?
I don't know if it comes through on JustTV, but there's no Bowie Matsu's autograph right there.
That's something my friends got me.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Something different.
I want everyone's opinion in the studio about this.
As some of you know, I go to cons and I sell hentai video games.
Now, we're thinking about changing the packaging design to make it look more like normal Wii, PS2, PS3 boxes.
I had said that I don't think that's a very good idea because we'd have to deal with the ESRB who would want the games rated and it would just go into a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Are you redistributing them from another person, or what is this?
I didn't know you wrote games, or what the hell is this?
We've redistributed them from a company called J-List.
Oh, okay, cool.
I know J-List.
I've ordered lots of snacks from them.
I think you're okay designing box art that's similar.
I mean, honestly, if you want good examples of parody, go to the porn industry.
That's kind of what you're going to have to do for these games.
You know... Hey, wait, hold on.
What?
Random porno fact here.
Did you remember that Not the Brady's thing that they had?
They have Not the Munsters now.
It's a porno Munsters movie.
We have in our house Not Another Porn Movie.
Oh, that's what we do now.
Yeah, so why not design, yeah, you could design something, come up with something unique, but you could certainly do something that's consistent across the hentai land so that, you know, when you see the purple border on the top of a certain shape or whatever, you know you're getting quality J-list hentai.
Now, why exactly are you redesigning the packaging in the first place?
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Design something consistent, like a purple bar along the top that's in a pixely art or something.
Do they have a name for the series?
Well, they're different hentai titles.
That's just it.
What's the name of a hentai title?
One of them is Almar's Professor Cherry.
That's one of the games that we sell.
Sexy Professor Series or something like that along the top in a pixely type art that makes me think of video games.
That could work, but I'm just more worried about the fact that expanding that the ESRB may be like, hey, you're selling PC games without our rating.
We don't want to deal with that.
You don't put their rating on it.
You're not making the games.
They don't give a shit.
And you're not big enough.
They're not going to notice.
That's what I said.
As long as it's very clear on the box, not for children, you'll be fine.
You gotta have it somewhere on the box, very clear.
Not for children.
Of course, if the box art is like a dick going in a pussy, I think that's gonna get the message across.
No, no, that's on the inside.
The actual DVD.
Are the fronts rather artistic?
Yes, they very artistic.
Hey, wait a minute.
We should get some of these games.
What they need to do is have embossed packaging, especially around the boobular area.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you guys what.
We do have some open copies I can send you guys in Sky.
I have some Yaoi titles for you.
Sweet!
Yes!
Look who's really excited about the Yaoi titles.
Did you hear that?
No, there's actually a couple I almost bought.
You know what?
Again... I'll review them for the show.
Ranma, here's my advice.
You can do the DVD packaging.
It's on a small enough scale I don't think they're going to care.
Don't flat out copy what the big boys are doing.
Come up with something similar.
Nothing like that.
Yeah.
Alright.
There you go.
And some of the chat room wants to see some of this art.
No!
Yeah, no, they're not going to want to carry it, but you might be able to get it in indie game stores.
You never know, with back rooms.
Hey, here's my thought, though.
Honestly, I know this is going to sound crazy, but go back in gaming's history and look at some of the box art that came out for games like Custer's Revenge, or even on the completely opposite end of the spectrum, go look at some of the box art for Bible Adventures and some of those games that came out on the NES, because those games were unauthorized, correct?
They were not official Nintendo products.
Correct.
And some of the Color Dreams games, you might find some inspiration.
Alright, well Ranma, we gotta let you go though, but good luck with the business.
You're doing a great thing for the community.
Oh, we definitely do.
Oh, and Rob, before I go, I know you and Jamie like Rumble Roses.
There is a porn version of that available.
It's called Ready to Rumble.
Is there a hentai podcast?
Probably.
I know my podcast gets a little bit hentai-ish.
Check the chat room.
You know what?
I think there is one.
I don't know if this guy listens anymore, but I remember way, way, way back in the day when we first, first started podcasting.
We were doing the to-go stuff, right?
There was a guy who ended up starting a hentai podcast because we got referrals from his site.
I remember that.
So there's at least a hentai podcast, but a hentai gaming podcast, that might be a niche that needs to be discovered, my friend.
Well, I might have to start reviewing them on my own podcast then, huh?
All right.
There you go.
Alright, we gotta let you go Ranma, have a good one buddy Thanks a lot, y'all have a good one You're a true American You know the company that made Custer's Revenge?
What, who?
I have a friend named Mystique Oh, Mystique Entertainment?
Yeah I met Mystique, right?
Yeah, the Amazonian girl Yes, she was nice Yeah, she is, she's great She's fun But the box is so funny It is very funny See, but it's shaped like a normal Atari box Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?
Hi folks, this is a standing neighbor I'm sorry, what was your name again?
and Spazinator.
Spazinator!
What's on your mind, Spazinator?
Not much.
There was two questions I neglected to put into my email that I just thought of.
First off, considering that Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting and Samurai Shodown 2 are both available for Xbox Live Arcade, do you suppose there's any chance that
Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo and Samurai Shodown 4 Avacoustas will eventually come out for Xbox Live Arcade or no?
Where there is money to be made, they will make it.
But aren't they doing the Super Street Fighter 2 High Def thing?
That is coming out on Xbox Live, the Super Street Fighter 2 High Def Remix.
They're doing that.
I don't know about Samurai Shodown 4 so much, though.
It really depends on how the other one sells.
That's what it is.
yeah well honestly if you ask me I think that at least with the samurai showdown series the fourth game is probably the best in the series if you ask me but that's just one person's opinion but you know what else is selling though are those compilations and you never know one of those is probably going to come out at some point for xbox 360 because they have them on playstation 2 why not there's people that buy that stuff like candy so you know even if it doesn't show up on arcade you'll probably see it in a compilation down the line
What was the other question?
Now, considering that sometime next year in the United States to come out with the DSi, these polls that for someone that only got the DS Lite within the past few months and really only got it for certain third-party games like
The Final Fantasy Remakes, The Genealogy Wars and what not.
Do you suppose there's any good reason for someone to upgrade to the DSi or should we just stick to the DS Lite?
Well, this is interesting.
Systems like the DSi are kind of starting to blur the line of our golden rule of gaming, and we've said this a million times on the show, but the golden rule of gaming is a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
So if there are games that are going to take advantage of the DSi's features that you absolutely have to have the DSi for...
Thanks for watching!
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
or do I already have what I really want on my iPhone?
I don't think we know enough about the system yet to really answer these questions.
I think there's definitely the oohs and ahs factors going on there, but the problem is the camera, we've seen it before.
The downloadable content, we've seen it before.
Everything they're putting into the DSi, we've seen before, we just haven't seen Nintendo do it.
So the question is, how is Nintendo going to do this and make it their own?
And I think that's really what has to be demonstrated.
Anybody have anything else they want to add to that?
I don't know.
Yeah, not to go poo-pooing on Nintendo or anything, but... Oh, why not?
I was poo-pooing on them earlier.
I kind of got away from Nintendo over the past 10 years, simply because, at least with the F64, they have had not too great of a game lineup.
They have a handful of games, but...
It's not overly great.
It goes with the GameCube and even to a certain extent, even the Wii.
I mean, yeah, the Wii is good for like the retro games and whatnot, but aside from that, I don't think it's useful.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We're probably like a year or two away from hearing something like that, and it's going to be the same question.
Do I really need to get one the first day, or does that game I have to have, is that a ways out?
You know?
Yeah, ironically, I think I heard either on Tech of the Show or X-Play within the past couple days that Nintendo's actually, you know, has formally announced or leaked some information about, you know,
You know, like a Wii 2 or Wii HD.
It was actually a dork.
It was some dude that quit EGM and 1UP or whatever.
He's a former editor that made that comment.
And to be honest, that type of rumor shows up every six months.
I mean, let's face reality.
Will Nintendo make another video game system?
Fuck yes, they will.
They've done extremely well with Wii.
Yes, they're going to make another video game system.
Will Nintendo make the system backwards compatible?
Yes, they will.
It was a big selling point of the Wii was the fact that they had all the GameCube games available.
So the fact that there will be another video game system from Nintendo is not news.
It's really not.
I don't know why all these... There will be another, whether they call it Wii or Wii 2 or, you know, Turkey Butt.
It doesn't matter what they call it.
I vote Turkey Butt.
There will be some new Nintendo system.
Turkey Butt, the game system.
But hey, we all laughed at Wii.
Dude, there's a new Mario game coming out on Turkey Butt.
There you go.
Honestly, I still give Nintendo a whole lot of crap about Wii.
It sounds like you're telling someone they're about to use the restroom or you're trying to speak French or something.
Maybe both, I don't know.
Right.
Well, Spazinator, good luck in your quest for the DSi.
You know what?
You don't have to decide right now.
We're not getting it for a year anyway.
Honestly, I would not import them unless, like, I had no digital camera or, you know, I don't know.
But then again, Loki's really big on the whole.
I want to exploit that SD card best I can, so maybe I can see that angle too.
But I'm lazy too.
You have a lot of time to decide this.
So good luck to you.
We'll keep bringing you the updates so I know what games are going to release.
So take care, buddy.
All right.
You too.
Thanks for the call.
Bye-bye.
Alright, let's take another call Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
This will be the one and only Dark Knight Hey Dark Knight, what's on your mind, my friend?
Hello
I'm talking about the DSi thing, talking about the innovation, and I remember you made a mistake earlier calling the DSi phone.
Watch it probably end up being the next thing they'll probably do down the line.
Well, it's just a matter of time.
Tons of fucking people own a DS.
I mean, really.
I mean, I remember back in the day you were kind of a nerd if you had the old school Game Boy brick or whatever.
Very few people had those.
I know.
The God Matrix one.
We were sitting in a plane coming back from Penny Arcade Expo and I looked across the aisle and there was an old lady with gray hair playing her DS.
And I think that shows you just what a long way gaming has come in handheld gaming in so many years.
It's funny though when you think about it though.
You know, and really a more appropriate pun would be a DSi Touch is really what this thing is kind of to me because it's going to have like little calendars and all sorts of things.
And you know what?
It might be kind of cool.
Like I said, I'm going to get one, but it's just I joke because it's kind of like, well, I feel like we've kind of seen this all before.
How is Nintendo going to make this special?
Should we go through the history list of the Game Boy again like I did the previous night?
I mean, so many sad things they did to it and whatnot.
You can go all the way back from the dot matrix Game Boy to Game Boy Color, Game Boy Microphone.
Game Boy, um...
Right?
Like they were showing off the headset and I think they do have the headset.
They're not quite as on board as the PSP is with Skype and everything.
But what do you want to bet?
Nintendo could Nintendo-fy the entire way we think about VOIP.
And when I say that, I mean make it disgustingly simple so that even grandma can use it.
That's how they're going to get into the phone industry.
Well, think about this though.
In the homebrew community, somebody actually already did that a while back.
Yeah, the grandma on the airplane doesn't know that.
Yeah, not many people don't know that.
There's one that somebody already made like a little what?
Like a little V over IP thing in the homebrew community already.
It's just that not many people don't know about it nor have the equipment to do so.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
That might be kind of neat.
Yeah, that would be a killer vibe.
That would be kind of neat, but that will never happen.
As hard of a time as we give Nintendo, they might actually be sitting on Genius.
It's just a matter of, will they do it?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkNight specifically, are you going to get the DSi?
I'm probably going to pass on it because I'm basically going to be like... I'll wait for it when a graphical change hits the DS.
I'm not going to... I mean, innovation alone is not really going to wow me this much.
I'm still happy with my DS fat.
Yeah, exactly.
I mean, why did we even really need to upgrade to the light in the first place?
Although I did, so it's hard for me to talk.
I told him, I said... I was telling some people tonight, I said...
If the DS were to have a slight graphical upgrade, I may jump on it.
But right now, the DS, I just basically like niche stuff and whatnot.
I don't need all that niche stuff right now.
I really don't.
It's not really worth it.
All right.
Well, any other thoughts tonight, Dark Knight, before we let you go?
We want to try to get one.
I had so many thoughts, but I left my brain, but I'll be discussing it next week when I do my thing.
Alright, it's all good, Dark Knight.
You have a good night, okay?
And thanks for calling.
Yeah, you do the same.
Take care, guys.
Talk Nintendo with us.
Have a good one.
Alright, we'll take one more call.
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
And you can talk about Nintendo, or you can talk about Tokyo Game Show, you can talk about SingStar ABBA.
Orange Lounge Radio
Well, basically about the ACDC track pack Walmart is going to sell.
Yes.
I'm thinking that maybe Harmonix and EA in this case are taking the steps of Activision and...
What they're doing with Guitar Hero, you know, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, and next year, Guitar Hero Metallica.
Maybe they're going the same steps.
Though, I'm thinking that they are doing the wrong thing with it.
I think they should have...
maybe release the disc itself but also made it download content and maybe offer it for a cheaper price because $30 for 20 or so songs, for me, I think it's expensive even though it's a new game.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Look at how much I am freaking obsessed over seeing Star ABBA.
Half of it is in jest, but the other half really isn't.
I freaking love ABBA.
They're the best band out of the 70s.
Call me the biggest gay or whatever you want, but I will buy this game because it's awesome.
There are people like that out there for ACDC.
The question is, how much are going to put $40 out there to get this game?
And if this sells even remotely well, the floodgates are going to burst open next year and you are going to see this kind of stuff.
for 10 bands next year.
I mean, if they can make that much money off of it, this is where music is going.
Yeah, that's why I'm worrying because if it sells, and I know it will sell because there are a lot of ACDC fans, but maybe they could offer the same thing
just on the Xbox Live Marketplace or on the PlayStation Network.
And we made it also downloadable because not everyone is a fan of ACDC, but some of them like their songs.
Maybe the same thing you could say with ABBA.
Like someone said on chat earlier, you could make the songs downloadable content for SingStar on the PlayStation 3, but there aren't.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
with you know monies and shirts and everything these are not the people that want their songs going two dollars a pop i mean they probably want to go all in with this stuff you know what i mean
They don't want their song thrown in as an afterthought in the game.
They want an experience built around their band.
You know this is how they're selling it to them.
When they sit down at the table with ABBA, with ACDC, they're sitting there saying, we want to make this game a whole new way to experience your band and your music and the brand you built.
Just feeding the ego.
Yeah, that's true.
But still, I think they could offer the disc for all the fans because I know there are going to be people that are going to buy it just because it's ACDC.
Like I said, and even you, you're going to buy the disc because it's up.
If they make a Deftones track pack, I know I'm going to buy it because I'm a big Deftones fan.
But still, they could offer
The same thing for a cheaper price, at least.
I would buy the ACDC pack for $30, at least.
It's going to be a separate game.
It's going to have its own achievements and everything.
Think about this.
Here's what it is.
I bet you this is it.
Look at the time of year this game is coming out too.
It's really hard to buy someone download content as a present.
But if you're Grandma and you're walking in the aisles of Walmart and you know little Timmy loves ACDC...
What do you think you might end up buying him as a present?
Because you know he loves ACDC, you know he loves Rock Band.
That's a huge factor in this.
Don't discount that.
Grandma's less likely to pick up the point cards than she is to pick up ACDC Rock Band track pack as a present.
Something to think about.
I don't know.
All these are things to consider.
They definitely all are.
Blackwolf wants to point out also the ACDC pack is cheaper as a track pack than it would if it were separate.
It's $30 as a track pack.
It's $35 if each song was available for $2 a pop individually.
But again, I think they're catering to the impulse buys.
That's what they are.
Yeah, the 360 and the PlayStation 3 version is going to sell for $39.99, so $40 exactly.
It's still a little bit expensive, especially because of people that download songs and maybe have a particular song they like and they would like to play.
But still, they would have to buy the $30 disc and just for one song.
And here's the thing, too, is if you have a friend that, say, likes ECDC and doesn't really necessarily have Rock Band or doesn't really care about dumping the songs onto his hard drive, you could dump them on your own hard drive and then maybe go in half with him for the actual game.
I don't think there's enough people that are going to think about that.
All right, Actdeft, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for your call, and hey, I'll be crossing my fingers for the Deftones game for you, okay?
Thanks.
All right, take care, buddy.
Quick comments from chat, though.
We're going to wrap up for the Skype line tonight.
Sorry to those who didn't get through, but we do want to wrap up the show here.
Reading some comments from chat.
I like this.
Redertainment says, Grandma is not likely to pick up a game anyway.
For herself, no.
But if your grandma does buy ACDC Rock Band for herself, you do have the coolest fucking grandma in the world.
My grandmother drove me all over Mobile trying to find Killer Instinct when it came out.
Awesome.
That is very awesome.
I do have the coolest grandmother in the world.
I don't, but I think Grandma might buy it for, I don't, you know, I use Grandma loosely, you know what I mean?
Like, you know, a friend trying to, or a relative trying to buy it for, you know, but you know what I mean?
I still have the coolest grandmother in the world.
And nobody said that it wasn't exclusive, you know, permanently for Walmart.
I mean, seriously, I have a feeling that maybe it will come out as download content later on.
That's true.
Wherever they can sell it, they will.
Grandma is person buying a game for other people, says Seg.
That's the point.
You got it.
Alright, that's it.
We're going to wrap up.
It's another show.
We're done.
We're out of here.
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
And we will start off with Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is I have a game that I'm going to be playing a lot of and you'll see some of that very soon.
Alright.
I never ask for any last minute stories.
I have a last minute story.
Okay, some quick headlines.
I'm sorry.
Dark Sakura.
for anyone who actually is interested in playing on the international Ragnarok Online server they have a free server up it's called Valkyrie and you've got a couple of detriments to playing on it but really it's good if you want to get into the official Ragnarok Online community and I'll link a page in the chat room alright, very cool
PopCap is releasing Bejeweled Twist in October.
I told my wife and she didn't give a shit.
Apparently she's over Bejeweled now.
I don't know.
It's weird.
But it's supposed to add some new features to it.
No word on what those features are yet, but something that has to do with probably twisting, I'm guessing.
The PSP 5.0 firmware is out there in testing phase right now, and it is going to add the Wi-Fi store and also allow you to do screen captures.
which are currently available in the not so official homebrew firmwares right now.
And no word on when that's going to be coming, but hopefully, probably sometime in October.
Finally, it's rumored that Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood is becoming Rock Band download content on October 14th.
This actually comes from a post on iMeme.com where they are doing a giveaway of Motley Crue's albums.
They also mentioned that Dr. Feelgood will be coming as download content on Rock Band starting October 24th.
Taiko no Tachigen
or 7,980 yen.
And the drums also can be purchased separately for 3,990 yen or approximately $38.
And of course the game will be out in Japan on the Wii December 12th.
It's kind of neat.
So since I kind of derailed your other thought, do you now have a final thought now that we've gotten all the last-minute stories taken care of?
No.
All right.
My final thought is I hear they're opening a Pinkberry in the Bay Area, and I want to go because it's good.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
All right.
Hey, knock it off.
All right.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
and it helps spread the word because the more 5 star reviews we get the higher we get in the rankings so please leave us some more nice reviews on iTunes you guys are awesome for that and one other quick thing before we head out tonight
One other very, very quick thing before we head out tonight.
As I understand it, two of OLR's listeners, Deke Mann and Kiki Nico, I don't know if you know, but last year they had a baby.
One year ago, they had a baby, Kylie.
And Kylie is turning one year old this week.
So we want to say happy birthday to Kylie on baby's first birthday.
You know, I was going to say, because I don't have any, I'm not going to sing happy birthday because I don't sing.
I will give you a little bit of this.
Happy birthday to baby Kylie.
And also happy birthday to Kylie Minogue whenever her birthday is.
Sorry, I had one last story.
No, the show's over.
No, one more.
This is kind of cool.
Okay.
All right.
Bungie's bringing out a video renderer soon to Halo 3.
So they'll actually have an option for those who subscribe to the Bungie Pro where you'll be able to actually export videos made in Halo to Windows Media Format.
for whatever you may want to use that for.
Okay, that is kind of cool.
Yeah.
But not nearly as awesome as Kylo Minogue.
