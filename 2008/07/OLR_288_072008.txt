Night, July 20th, 2008.
At E3, Microsoft announces a Netflix partnership, Sony is set to launch a new MAG game, and Nintendo announces a Grand Theft Audible portable game.
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
But we're not cool enough for E3, I'm sorry to say.
No, we just sat here bitter all week long eating our bonbons and watching it on TV.
Right, DarkSakura?
My lovely co-host?
Hell no.
I did other stuff.
Like what?
Going outside?
What's that?
I went to Classic Gaming Expo.
Not Classic Gaming Expo.
What the hell am I saying?
California Extreme.
TechMasterLoki
I'm doing okay.
All right.
Now, you did not go to California Extreme.
No, I did not go to California Extreme.
What did you do in lieu of E3 this year?
I actually watched E3, watched the press conferences streaming.
During work, I might add, because it technically is work-related.
All right, you sell the games, so it's kind of work-related for you.
Yeah, I tried getting that past management.
Luckily, management wasn't there, so we watched it anyways.
Nice.
Yeah, so it was interesting.
I ended up reading it through blogs because my day job I teach, not kids but adults, I teach in a corporate environment and so I didn't really have a chance to watch anything live so I just had to kind of read it through blogs but you know people had it covered I guess although it would have been more exciting to be there but you know what can you do
You can go to a different expo, that's what you can do And we'll talk more about that in a little while But first, let's hear about the trip that Jamie took this week Which I'm surprised somebody would do a gaming expo the same week as E3 But you went on a little trip, right?
Yes, I went all day for Saturday.
It ended today.
But I ran into lots of people that I know, including someone in our chat room right now, GS68.
Cool.
Who actually found me.
Nice hat, by the way.
And I ran into Mella Melody.
I ran into Wendell and some of his buddies.
And saw a few other notable personages.
I actually saw Jason Enos in line.
GS68 has actually posted his share of pictures from the event on his little photo bucket in our chat room, chat.orangelonsradio.com.
And what's this I see here?
I think this might be a picture.
Ah, yes, there is DarkSakura, our very own little space invader.
Nice.
Melody and I wanted to steal it.
And some other lady with her ass on the table right next to you.
I look like hell Like hell
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and a few more recent ones.
Dude, there's a spider again!
I got an email with a Journey arcade game picture, so I know you played that at least.
I didn't play it.
Melody did.
It made part of my soul hurt.
Why?
Just because I cried from nostalgia.
Did she get the... She finally got the concert toward the end of the day.
I was going to say, you have to get the tape to play.
That's the best part.
Okay, so, games.
I've got a list of stuff I did and did not play.
First of all, they had a demo of a Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remake set up.
And they had a PlayStation 3 set up with the online games, including Puzzle Fighter HD, which I watched Wendell and Mel play.
Melody and I played Ride and Fighters 2, which was pretty fucking sweet, and I got 5th highest score.
They had the Prop Cycle Addams Family there.
What?
You know the people that have the Prop Cycle set up to play Addams Family?
No, I haven't seen that.
Oh, you have too, because we commented on it.
Really?
I've seen the Prop Cycle, but I've never seen it.
Let me see.
Oh, that is kind of strange.
Is actually someone on a prop cycle attached to an Addams Family and the game runs as you pedal.
Interesting.
I've had pictures of this set before.
Moving on.
My phone's upside down, Rob.
Star Wars Racer Arcade
and I think it was like a submarine or space game before or something, but it was kind of neat.
They had Blasteroids there, which I didn't play.
And I was so mad because I took a picture of a guy in a Big Bang Bar shirt, but the picture didn't come out well.
And then they had one of those mini SNK cabinets.
Like, there's, if you can see...
We had to play on our knees to play it.
And so we played Puzzle Bobble.
And Melody and I played a sit-down of Crystal Castles, the two-player sit-downs.
Oh, cool.
Like one of the cocktail, yeah.
You set your drink on it.
and then I didn't... Oh yeah, this is a picture of some dude playing Journey.
So is it just Arcade Game Madness or what?
They have these little panels and stuff there too, right?
Yeah, panels.
Dan went to the panel that had Steve Ritchie, who's the guy who designed some of the best pins ever, like Twilight Zone and No Fear.
We actually have a lot of the games that he designed.
By the way, they did have Tapper, but I didn't play.
Awesome.
But they...
He went to that panel, and then I went to a panel later on with Dan to see someone talk about customizing.
I'm trying to be understanding because it was his first panel, it just wasn't very well presented.
I think, you know, with a little bit of experience he can do better, but there were some interesting things.
And then we went to a panel about the guy who made Donkey Kong 2.
As in, he sprite-ripped and redid levels to have going after the original four in Donkey Kong.
Because I was going to say, wait, Donkey Kong 2 is Donkey Kong Jr., but this is a different thing.
This is an actual Donkey Kong 2.
Interesting.
And you can find the... He actually has a website and everything.
And then I went to watch Tilt, but I only watched the first part of it because I've seen the rest of it.
But it's like about the end of William's pinball division in the Pinball 2000 that came out.
It did play some episode one.
And I played a sit-down Sinistar.
Beware, I live
and then, oh, there's my beer.
I also played an eight ball deluxe, which is the, I think as far, if I'm right, is the second highest grossing flipper using pinball table.
The first being Addams Family.
and then I played the Ted Nugent pinball, which was actually really good.
I didn't even know that existed.
Galaga 98, Pacmania, Monopoly, Pango.
There was a Pango in a really good condition.
I love Pango.
A really good, pretty Tron.
How many people were there?
Tons.
There were just a lot of people.
Although I honestly don't know that the turnout this year was as good as last.
They didn't have the auction.
Do you think it might have to do with the fact they're holding at the same time as E3 too?
I don't think that was really their choice.
Because from what I understand, they were trying to avoid scheduling around the Jazz Festival in San Jose.
Now, this one's a cool one.
If you can see, it's a black Spider-Man pinball machine.
They only made, I think, 500 of them.
So someone brought it in.
And if you hit the right flipper button, you can play it in Spanish.
And then there's this guy here who had a Flynn's t-shirt on, which if anyone is a big Tron nut like me, you know that that's the name of the arcade that the guy had.
And then this was really cool.
Someone took the wizard pinball table, which was the one that Elton John was playing in Tommy, and made the big boots and put it up on a stand to play on like in Tommy's.
Alright, I have to address this, because Bobby's saying this in our chatroom, chat.orangelearnsradio.com, and our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us on allgames.com, he says, It wasn't the same time as E3.
E3 ended Thursday.
If anything, it made it easier for someone to attend it.
They could just hop up after E3.
But I'm thinking, like, okay, I've been to E3 in the past.
Granted, it was a lot different back then.
I know how I felt at the end of E3.
I didn't want to do shit.
The idea of another gaming expo was, like, the furthest thing from my mind.
If somebody had told me, hey, let's go to a gaming expo tomorrow, I would be like, you've got to be kidding me.
So, I don't know.
Maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too close together.
You gotta give it at least a month.
It would have been really tight.
I just have to say the one day of me going, well, granted, I didn't have the medication that I have to take, but I got so tired just walking around.
Because we left the house at 10, and we got there just a little bit after noon, actually closer to 1, so Dan could hit that panel he wanted to go to.
But just walking around all day.
Just all day walking.
And I was pretty much dead tired.
I did nothing but sleep today.
You better prepare yourself for PAX.
That's going to be three days.
I'm going to bring better shoes.
All right.
Oh, my God, shoes.
All right.
Oh, my God, shoes.
Thank you for the lovely report.
We'll hear more from Dan later, possibly.
Well, no.
All right.
But go to our forum.
In our Orange Lounge chat area, I did post up the review that Dan wrote for us.
Since we have nowhere on the front page to do it... Yet.
Yet.
Alright.
But Dan wrote a lengthy review.
Loki, how was your gaming week while you weren't attending any cool expos?
Like the cool kids.
It was okay.
Like...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Tales of Vesperia.
I didn't like it.
I really wanted to like it.
I already had it pre-ordered.
It looked like a game I could probably get into, kind of like Eternal Sonata or something like that.
What did it for me is I thought it was a little cheesy.
I mean, the graphics are awesome.
The graphics are just like Eternal Sonata, I noticed.
The combat was kind of annoying.
I didn't like the combat.
Probably the same voice actors, too.
Yeah, I didn't like the combat one bit.
That kind of ruined it for me.
It's all kind of real-time, and you switch between your characters, and you cast spells and stuff, and everyone kind of is on autopilot, which kind of sucked.
I liked Eternal Sonata a lot better, where it was turn-based, and you could do all that real-time stuff within a certain time limit.
I thought that was pretty cool, but this was kind of all over the place.
And...
Then my buddy played Too Human.
I didn't get a chance to play it because I tried downloading the demo twice.
Both times it was corrupted, so that was awesome.
And here it was just mediocre, so I don't know.
But he's going to buy it because he liked games like Conan and stuff like that.
Which, you know, I kind of like that too.
It doesn't really take much to impress me as far as action games go.
I mean, I don't know.
But, um...
I did play some DS games.
I played Metal Slug 7 a bit.
And I didn't really play the main game of it, because, I mean, shit, it's just Metal Slug.
But they had these, like, challenge mode things in there, and that was kind of interesting.
You had different tasks, and once you finish those, you go up in rank and stuff like that.
It gets harder.
So that's kind of cool with the added replayability.
And then I played...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And... What else did I play?
I think that was pretty much it.
I was just kind of going all over the place.
Oh, I went back to play some old Xbox Live Arcade games.
Played Zuma some more.
Because that's fun.
Because now that I have it hooked up to the TV again, Nelly's like, Oh, Zuma, I can play this again.
So...
Alright, sounds like you were keeping yourself busy with what you already have, games you already have to beat.
Exactly, and I was just looking at, there was stuff that came out this week, Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but all of it sucked.
and, uh, ooh, Tuesday.
This Tuesday.
My DS, I gotta dust it off with what's coming out this Tuesday.
We'll tell you later in the show when we get to release dates.
However, uh, my gaming week, I'll keep it short, um, because there really wasn't a lot to it.
I played most of the same stuff I've been playing.
Civ Rev, uh, Space Invaders Dream on PSP, but I had a little bit of Renaissance as well.
I, uh,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What's the point of this game?
He's kind of like, why do you like this game?
It seems like there's no point.
And I'm like, you're kind of right.
There is no point.
That's the point.
It's like The Sims.
There's no real point to that either.
But I thought I would play it to try and collect more of the NES games.
Because remember that was one awesome thing about Animal Crossing on the GameCube is that it had all the old school NES games buried in it.
Like you could get like Clue Clue Land.
How awesome is that?
And Donkey Kong Jr.
Math.
GameCubeVersion.com
So it's already outputting pretty much the same level that other Wii games would.
Granted, the slightly more advanced Wii hardware would probably make a better F-Zero game, but I want to see something like F-Zero on like 720, 1080 level.
That would be awesome.
Was that like F-Zero?
That's a fun racing game.
And I was a little sad they didn't announce that, a new F-Zero game at their press conference.
But what can you do?
But you have to understand, the E3 wasn't for the core gamer, for at least Nintendo.
So all the stuff they announced was casual stuff.
GameGuru in chat, chat.northstar.com, does correct me and says Donkey Kong Junior Math is on the virtual console, but it's not worth $5.
Correct, it's not worth $5 considering you can get an Animal Crossing for free.
There you have it.
Alright, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping.
This week, as we announced at our own E3 press conference last week, you will get one big show.
Hopefully everything on the technical end works, but you will get one big show.
There will no longer be part A and B, so the podcast feed might look a little different because of that, but that'll be pretty cool.
And that's it.
Otherwise, continue to support us by giving us positive reviews on iTunes.
We always appreciate that.
There's been a few new ones that have popped up lately, some very nice five-star reviews.
In fact, right now, if I checked correctly, we have exactly 69 reviews on iTunes right now, which is a great number to be at.
So thank you very much.
We would like some more, as nice as a 69 number is.
So don't forget that.
Our LiveJournal community.
We are at Community Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
So look us up there.
Facebook OL Army on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.
So we are your social networking BFFs on any of those sites you want to be our buds on.
All right.
Let's get into some gaming news.
This week a little different because we had E3 happen this week.
Nothing but press conference stuff in this half of the show.
We're going to talk about kind of the big three press conferences and our thoughts on it since –
Final Fantasy XIII would be coming to the Xbox 360 day and date in the U.S.,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It is not going to be coming, it's not exclusive in, or not coming to the Xbox 360 in Japan though.
Interesting.
But in the US, it will be coming out day and date.
Which really kind of shows that this whole move is motivated nothing by but sales.
Basically that they feel they have a better chance of penetrating the marketplace.
I think so, yeah.
Very interesting.
But my curiosity is, how long is it going to make this game be out?
I mean, like, how far do we have to wait for this game?
Because they admitted they haven't even really started developing this game for the 360.
I mean, they've been doing it on some type of PC design, like, what do they call it, Crystal or something?
They do it on, you know, it's probably their own design platform.
I think here's the thing.
It's not really going to be an issue with storage.
It's not going to be a problem getting it.
Obviously, it's not going to be on one disc, but that's fine.
I think it's actually not going to hold them up too much because it's a lot easier to develop for the 360 than it is for the PS3.
I know that Square Enix has a lot more experience developing for the 360 right now rather than the PS3.
I don't think it's really going to hold it up any more than localizing it would.
Mace Hatsuma in chat asked the question that I've been actually getting asked a lot this week because I've been pretty open on this show that I had no plans to get a Playstation 3 until Final Fantasy XIII came out so now this is a question I've been getting a lot this week as I'm sure a lot of people like me have Mace Hatsuma says will you buy a PS3 now?
You always said you'll buy a PS3 when Final Fantasy XIII comes out
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Thanks for watching!
is Sony likely to come down in price on those systems later?
We'll hear more about that later, I'm sure.
The thing I think also, too, you have to look at is from the publisher's standpoint, when they put this game out, and it's not even necessarily this game, because I'm thinking Last Remnant is going to be out way before this.
When that comes out, they're going to look at the sales of that
Game on both consoles.
And if it's anything like Grand Theft Auto 4 was, it's going to be a lot more on the 360 than it is on the PS3.
Now, that may not be the case.
Obviously, it's not going to be the case in Japan.
But they have to look at each market separately and kind of base their decisions on that.
Because if they were just to base it all on the Japanese market, then we wouldn't be getting anything on the 360.
I got two questions.
First is for Jamie because I haven't heard anything yet and I know you like Final Fantasy like the rest of us.
What was your reaction to the news?
I really didn't care.
I have both systems.
That leads into my next question, that you and Loki own both systems.
Knowing that Final Fantasy XIII, I guess you could say for all practical purposes, was being designed for the PlayStation 3, now it's coming out for the 360, do you think you're more inclined to get it on PlayStation 3, or what system do you think you might ultimately get this game on?
or have you even decided yet?
Probably PS3 because if that's what it was designed for then that's what it was designed for but it doesn't mean that later on I won't pick it up dirt cheap for Xbox 360.
I mean, depends on features.
Loki?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
What if they come out and say, you know what, the 360 version did have to take a little hit in quality?
I don't care.
Now, if I were you, if I heard one iota of the 360 is going to have to sacrifice something, I'd pick it up on PS3.
I don't give a shit about achievements.
Name one game out there that runs better on the PS3 than the 360.
There isn't one.
It's always the other way around.
Sony fanboys and chat.orange.com, please.
I hear Oblivion's a little bit graphically better, but I don't know.
Yeah, but we're talking marginally.
This isn't going to be breaking any sort of... There's no discernible difference in between the two.
Look at all the games that come out now, and they do that stupid comparison between the 360 and PS3 versions.
There's minimal differences.
Unless you're talking when the PS3 version comes out and there's lag issues, frame rate issues, freezing issues, and stuff like that.
I don't know.
It's just not worth...
Picking up on the PS3 for.
Now, not to say that, like I said, there's stuff on the PS3 I definitely want.
Resistance Fallman 2.
Fuck yeah, I will be getting that on the PS3.
Alright, a couple people, a couple comments in chat.
Burnout Paradise is a game that's being mentioned.
And Joshi16 gives the lulz with Metal Gear Solid 4 plays better.
Yeah, but Burnout Paradise, okay, look at Burnout Paradise.
Hold on, hold on, let's let Jamie say it, because you wanted to say something a minute ago.
I was just going to say, still, all of that actually means really nothing to me, because I had already decided to get it on, you know, I had kept it in my head open that if it came out on Xbox 360, I don't, first of all, it's not coming out in Japan on Xbox 360.
They're not going to get the release.
This means that I can actually interact with a larger community on the PlayStation 3 version, first of all.
I don't care about achievements, and I really don't care about going online.
I would be able to find more stuff, a larger community, especially for me who loves the fan side of it.
I honestly think that the controller scheme lends itself better to RPGs on the PlayStation than on Xbox.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The other half of the fun for me is actually going on international sites and seeing what the world reaction is.
I love looking at fan art.
I love finding fan sites.
I think it's fun.
But that's fine, but that's not platform specific.
You're not going to only have PS3 fans.
That doesn't necessarily... That'd be like saying, for example, that you have fans for Eternal Sonata, but there's going to be fans for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 version.
It doesn't matter...
Thanks for watching!
Alright, let me let the chat have the last word here.
Ossifer says, isn't Versus XIII still exclusive to the PS3 in the US?
Even if it is, I'm sure that game will jump ship too.
Sales will probably be a big question as to whether that happens or not, I'd imagine.
Well, Versus XIII I don't think has been announced for the US yet.
It's still Japanese only, and if that's the case, then yeah, it probably still is PS3.
Well, they showed the trailer at E3 a couple years ago, so I'm thinking it's going to be... Yeah, but they also showed the trailer for Star Ocean like two years ago too, so...
As Sephiroth1215 and Xenocore agree, say the D-pad on the 360 is what's horrible.
And I agree.
That D-pad on 360 is awful.
That's the problem with the controller right there, is that D-pad.
Because I don't like to use the analog stick with a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games, and that D-pad sucks.
Especially for the retro games and fighters.
It's fighters.
That's the thing.
That's what the PlayStation 3 controller, I think, is better, is fighters.
But...
You know what?
If they wanted to take a clue from the best controller ever made, they should look at the Sega Saturn Dual Analog Controller for their model.
I like the Super Nintendo Controller.
It was a lot less complicated.
The Super Nintendo Controller, though, is also one of the primary inspirations for the PlayStation Controller.
Well, I'm sorry that you'll be handicapped when you get to the fighting game portions of Final Fantasy XIII.
Alright, shut up.
We're moving on.
Alright, other big news out of Microsoft's press conference that has to do with the installation of Xbox 360 games to your hard drive.
They actually announced that now you're going to be able to actually copy the games to your hard drive so you can play the games directly off your hard drive.
But, if you're thinking this means, haha, I can get them from Gamefly, copy them to my hard drive and send them back, no, you still have to have the original disc to play the game.
I'm curious how long that takes to get cracked though.
Yep, not long.
I'm curious because
People could probably burn their own CDs and bypass it.
I'm very interested to see how they security lock this.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Also, you're going to be able to access the marketplace on the web.
So if you're not next to the 360, you're surfing the internet at work like you shouldn't be, you can actually go on the internet and queue up downloads to automatically go to your 360, which sounds kind of interesting.
That would be pretty awesome is if they had a mode.
And they have this, I think, with the PS3 a little bit where you can...
Access your content from any hotspot or something like that.
But what if you could, say, leave your 360 in a standby mode and queue something up to download on your 360 from a PC that's nowhere near it and then actually have it download while you're out.
You know what I mean?
I guess that's kind of cool though if you don't like all those loading times on Xbox 360 on certain games.
It doesn't sound like it's going to really help the load times too much.
It's only going to improve them by 30% from what I read.
Interesting.
What games do you think will benefit most from this?
You can even do multi-disk installs though apparently.
If you want to install disc 2 and 3 of Lost Odyssey on your drive, you could do that.
I don't know why you would, but you could.
It's nice that it's an option.
um you know that's nice in case you want to do that and you don't have to but it would be nicer if I didn't have to have the original disc I mean granted I understand why they're doing it that way if they didn't piracy would run rampant but I wish there was some other type of way it could be validated that I actually owned and bought the game because I would love to just you know not have to swap discs out all the time like just pop up a menu on my 360 pick the game and go like the arcade games I love that
It would be nice.
Well, they could do that, but... Maybe authenticating with a serial number or something?
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
Like a serial key just like they do with MMOs and PC games.
Question mark?
I don't know.
Xbox?
Think about that for next year's E3.
I would love to be able to do that.
Seems to me that the key code would probably be the best way.
But that's also a problem, too.
Like, if you look, I know this is a small market, but rental market, you know, if you're renting it out with the manual and the key codes in there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll see.
Well, for anyone who's been looking for a sequel to Portal, there is an official one.
It's actually Portal's still alive.
It's going to be basically the single player story that was in Orange Box with some new challenges.
It's supposed to be on the Xbox Live Arcade.
Nothing about PC or PS3.
I think they already have this on the PC, actually.
They released a map pack that was based off the Flash Portal game, the 2D one, and that's what these levels are.
Those are the same levels that were available on the PC, I want to say for free.
But they've been la-di-da-ing this thing as an exclusive on the 360, right?
It is exclusive on the 360, this version of the game, like as a standalone thing, but it really is just those download maps that were available on the PC for free.
You know what though I hear about this game?
There's no GLaDOS.
That kind of makes me sad.
That's sadness.
It is sadness.
But hopefully there will still be cake.
Maybe this time, Jamie, maybe there's pie at the end this time.
But there's no story.
It's just challenge levels.
It's like the VR missions.
I guess, Jamie, you were quite the fan of Portal and I think a lot of the reason you liked it was the humor in it and the story, right?
Does this kind of...
I don't know, to me this seems a little bit milking, but I enjoyed the game in Portal 2, I really did.
But I'm kind of curious, what do you think about this, being that there's kind of less story, more just puzzle, puzzle, puzzle?
For the people who like the puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, that's good for them.
I just want snarky commentary.
If there's no snarky commentary, then... But you could make your own!
I'll let Dan play it and then I'll provide the snarky commentary you know what would make this game awesome other than cake is if later on for a few more Microsoft points they could release a level editor
for the arcade game and then release it where you can share levels.
But then what would they do for the actual Portal 2?
For the actual Portal 2?
I don't know.
Well, I mean, this might be Portal 2, but you know what I'm talking about, like a Portal actual full sequel.
Well, they can add some additional elements.
I think for the Portal PC game, they had levels and stuff with alternate...
Gravity sections where you're actually on the ceiling and stuff like that.
Really twisty, weird stuff.
So if they add that into Portal 2, and I think Portal 2 is supposed to be kind of different than Portal 1 altogether.
You know, kind of a different environment, more like Half-Life.
Then, yeah, there's a lot more to do.
I think that Lesserface is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.
Plus there's the guy that sounds like Colonel Sanders in there.
Oh, the G-Man?
Yeah.
No, no, the new guy, the new ghost of portal creator guy or whatever.
The one whose initials that you enter into the website to do the test that you can't save the results of.
I guess.
SSJ100Matt says in chat, they better give a free Carvel cake coupon with the new portal because they lied to us last time.
That would be funny.
That would be great.
And some folks in chat are imagining the play at home with DarkSakura making the commentary to Dan while he's playing.
Joshi16 says, DarkSakura to Dan, play better.
And ActDeft says, complete the puzzle or the cube dies.
No, no, no.
Half the time with Dan playing is me just trying to shut up because I figured out the puzzle.
Only I get too motion sick to do it.
So I'll be sitting there going, and he'll be like, what?
I'll be like, you should have done the portal over there.
Because then it'll come up over here, and if you do it this way, then this will happen.
He's like, oh.
He has that little, what I call the Charlie Brown cloud with a little cloud of steam over their head.
I have to just bite my lip and not say anything.
Ow.
All right, anyway, moving on.
All right.
Well, other news coming out of the Microsoft press conference.
I know this is a total shock because this was kept under super secret wraps.
Lips, their new karaoke game was announced and they had a lot of details on that, including...
Some pretty cool stuff.
Obviously the microphones are going to be motion sensitive and they're wireless as they should be.
They've got...
DarkSakura,
This sounds interesting.
I'm down with lips.
It looks a lot like Seeing Star to me, but I think Seeing Star is kind of fun.
It looks like this is Microsoft's thing.
They take other people's ideas and make them better.
Well, granted, it's not Microsoft themselves doing this.
It's the Elite Beat Agents folks.
But, hey, I love Elite Beat Agents.
It looks pretty cool.
This will be a karaoke game.
There's some other cool stuff about that, too.
They were saying that...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Um, saying that they're not sure if they're going to allow you to stream, like, say, your library if you have a PC connected on your network.
You know, you can stream music usually.
I'm not sure if they're going to allow you to do that.
Um, and also, um...
No word if you're going to actually be able to implement your own lyrics or song chart or something like that.
But they had some interesting ideas, I guess.
Some of the songs confirmed for it already.
They had Mercy by Duffy, Young Folk by Peter, and...
Peter, Bjorn, John, and Bust a Move by Young MC.
All the songs are master tracks and contain their original music videos.
Rap songs work a little bit different.
I guess it's not just about the rhythm in the game.
It's kind of cool they have rap and singing.
I can't wait to rap.
Hopefully we can get Loki to rap and put it on YouTube somewhere.
No.
All right.
Are you excited about Lips?
No.
All right.
You're not a karaoke fan, right?
Not really.
All right.
Well, I'll buy it.
I'll admit it.
I like karaoke.
I'm just hoping that it reads on my ABBA CDs correctly.
Exactly.
Because if you can put in your own music, we're having ABBA night.
Well, what they should do is they should have it where you can plug in, you know, how they have the CDDB and stuff like that, where you can pop in CDs and it'll detect what songs it is and stuff like that.
If you could do that, say, with this game as well, MP3s, and it'll detect what song it is and automatically download the lyrics, that'd be pretty awesome.
We're going to reenact the Mamma Musical, or Mamma Mia Musical, right here.
It'll be fun.
All right.
Not on the air, though.
Listeners have done nothing to deserve that.
Hey, more details coming out of Microsoft's camp, including that big dashboard update that's been rumored.
There's going to be a huge dashboard update coming a little later this fall.
And apparently, some of the cool stuff that they're going to be putting in this dashboard update is Netflix integration.
If you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber and a Netflix subscriber, you can now use Netflix on your Xbox 360.
You can stream movies from your Netflix queue to your 360, which I think is kind of cool.
The thing is, though, only certain movies, the ones that they allow to be streamed on the internet, will do this.
Not in HD, sadly.
It's going to be SD only for now, but they say when Netflix is ready to do HD, Microsoft's ready to bring HD home.
So that's kind of interesting.
The big shock and awe avatars.
Oh, we didn't see anything of that coming.
But yeah, the avatars, which are kind of like the Mii ripoffs, but of course, you know, they want to do a little bit better.
So now not only do you have these avatars, but now you have these little like rooms that your avatars can go in.
It's not like home, but it kind of is.
It's not even really, I mean, because it's just like this big white room, kind of like the construct.
You can still use your gamer tags pictures, like if you have an Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic, because we actually have one on the marketplace, I don't know if you've seen it.
It's in community gamer pics too, but if you have like your OLR gamer pic, you can still use it, but they are going to kind of try to get people to switch over to avatars, which, yeah.
Games will now be able to give you Avatar Unlocks.
But that's not too much of a surprise when you consider games as it is can give you gamer picks.
It's just that a lot of games choose not to do it.
Now, I got a question for you.
Do you feel ripped off at all?
I mean...
I know you can use your themes with, I mean, but it's like in the background, like far background and stuff.
It's not quite as integrated as before.
But do you feel ripped off for buying, say, themes or gamer picks off of Xbox Live and now they're going to switch it all over to avatars?
Because you know they're just going to fucking sell clothing and shit for your avatars.
And that's how they're going to make even more money off that crap.
It's all Gaia.
I haven't bought any of that stuff in a while, so I'm okay.
Ever since the OLR gamer pick came out, I have no use for other gamer picks.
As far as themes go, not a lot of that stuff makes me actually want to go, ooh, I want to spend a dollar for that.
Because you can get custom themes off your PC.
As long as I can still do that, I'm down.
As long as I can still do that.
That's special.
Also, I want to point out real quick before we move on, another thing that was announced is Xbox Live Prime Time, and one specific thing that was announced is a version of 1 vs. 100, and this is actually something where they're going to have a live night where you can be a part of this game show thing using your avatars, and supposedly you're going to be able to win real prizes.
So you could be playing in your Xbox as one of the people in the mob in this 1 vs. 100 show.
That sounds fun.
That's kind of interesting.
Yeah.
It's a very casual gamer-friendly thing, too.
I can imagine whole families getting around to play this type of game.
Remember they used to have some sort of service like that?
I'm not sure if it's still around now where you could do that with TV shows and you'd actually be playing along with the live TV show.
Game Show Network does that on their website.
Not necessarily through that.
This actually was...
It reminds me of the old Berkeley Systems games on the PC.
I don't know if you guys ever played Acrophobia or... God, there was the other game with the tower in it.
And I apologize if you're hearing that noise.
I don't know what's causing that.
It sounds like a cell phone noise or something.
That's a cell phone interacting with speakers.
Okay, I don't think they got that on the show.
Sorry.
Whoa, hello, live radio.
But yeah, it reminds me of that.
Like that Berkeley System stuff back in the day.
I used to love those games.
Those game shows are so much fun.
So I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out on Xbox.
Hopefully it doesn't all crash the first night because you know that's something that is likely to happen.
Well, in other news, more stuff for Xbox Live Arcade is a present for us from the people who brought us Pac-Man Championship Edition.
It's called Galaga Legions, so it's very shiny and pretty.
And it's the same sort of redesigned, you know, same type of play that, you know, is trying to stick with the style, but trying to beef it up for the modern era.
So, it's shiny.
That's cool.
I mean, but again, it's going to be one of those things where you start to go, why did I buy the original Galaga when this is available now?
Well, the original Galaga came out in the 80s and you were probably five.
I know, I know, but still.
I don't know, this resembles more like Geometry Wars than Galaga.
It's definitely a lot more flashy.
It's kind of one of those things I want to get my hands on to see how it really works.
Yeah, because Pac-Man Championship Edition was only like half Pac-Man to me, you know what I mean?
There was a whole different strategy to it than in the regular Pac-Man, even though at first glance it looks the same.
I'm assuming Galaga will be similar, who knows.
I'm thinking it's going to follow that type of suit.
Yeah, most likely.
The DS, I know Rob is looking forward to this.
Final Fantasy 4, maybe it's way out.
Also on the DS this week, Azuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns.
And I know a lot of people like that one.
On DS as well, and I played a little bit of this a few weeks ago, New International Track and Field for the DS.
If you really want some frantic, I guess, stylus rubbing on there, that's going to be game for you.
Now, also on PC, a bunch of smaller titles here.
City Life 2008 Edition, Baseball Mogul 2009, Uber Soldier 2, The End of Hitler.
Awesome title there.
And let's see here on the DS.
Also, Nancy Drew, Mystery of the Cluebender Society.
On the Wii, we've got Kids Sports Crazy Golf.
Another Shovelware title from Destineer.
The Mummy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor on PS2, Wii, and DS.
Sadly enough, I think that's the biggest game this week.
And Order Up on the Wii.
Yet another Cookie Mama type game.
And finally, this I believe is on the Xbox Live Arcade and PS3, or PS Network.
We've got 1942 Joint Strike coming out on the arcade this week.
Final Fantasy 4 on the DS
Not really.
God, they have voice acting in it.
And you want to know one thing I learned from the voice acting?
I always thought the main character's name was Cecil.
That's what it looks like, right?
Cecil?
Cecil is apparently the name.
If you listen to the voice acting.
That makes sense because I don't think there's a C sound in Japanese.
I was just surprised a little bit.
I mean, you know.
All these years, I'm thinking one thing and it turns out it's the other.
It's just blowing your mind.
It's just blowing my mind, exactly.
Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the release dates that are going to be happening over there.
In fact, the entire Asia region is getting a version of WALL-E on the Xbox 360 this week.
But over in Japan specifically, Bully Scholarship Edition finally makes its way to Japan on July the 24th, as well as their local version of Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock.
It is the same song list, if you were wondering.
It is not a J-Rock song list.
If it was, I'd be importing that shit because that would be a lot of fun, I think.
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Kung Fu Panda, as well as the PlayStation 3 Eye Camera Pack.
I guess that's some type of new eye bundle.
Also, Siren.
Isn't that like the remake of the first Siren on PlayStation 3 or something?
New translation.
It's the episodic game now.
Ah, so there you have it.
That's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
Wangen Midnight finally gets a price reduction.
Good, because they gave me blue ass.
Samurai Shodown
Yeah, some type of... No, what Samurai Shodown is over here.
Right, some type of compilation package it looks like.
That's cool.
Yeah, it's their version of Samurai Shodown Anthology.
So that's pretty cool.
Although I'm surprised they wouldn't just do that for Virtual Console.
Because they're releasing Yo-Yo games on Virtual Console now.
And I guess if there are people that will buy it... Especially if it's got all the way up through 5 and maybe the 64 versions, even though they were shitty.
A couple price reductions on PlayStation 2, including Biohazard 4, Resident Evil, Busou Orenken, Burnout Dominator, as well.
But coming out new on the PlayStation 2 this week, their own version of Bully's Scholarship Edition, as well as the Samurai Spirits Anthology Collection comes out in Japan this week as well.
Moving to the handhelds, the DS, you can get some new little sticky film things for your DS.
All for the Peanuts gang!
Hooray!
Because I guess the Peanuts are actually still really big in Japan.
Speed Racer comes out on the DS as well, Twilight Syndrome as well as SimCity DS gets a price reduction Kung Fu Panda gets another release over there on the DS and Kiraren Revolution Minna di Odoru Furifuri Debut comes out from Konami I'm thinking it says Revolution in the title so at first you think it might be a music game but no it's some other type of little action game that looks cutesy
Don't know a lot else about that game, sorry.
Checking out the PSP real quick, and then we'll call it a wrap for Japanese dates this week.
On the PSP, you get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, a price reduction, Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus, and, oh, too bad there isn't a plushie, Infinite Loop comes out as well.
Accent Core Plus would be funny.
It's all stuffed animals fighting.
Fighting each other.
That'd be awesome.
That's it for your Japanese release dates.
In the UK, just a few things.
On the 22nd, Izuna 2, The Unemployed Angel Returns on DS.
On the 23rd, 1942, Joint Strike on Xbox 360.
The same one to be out the next day on PlayStation 3.
25th, Buzz Master Quiz, Race Driver Grid on DS.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9.
I'm sorry, 11.
Shit.
God, I remember the first one.
Super Swing Golf on Wii.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9 is on PC wow cool alright well the next big conference that we had up during E3 was of course Nintendo and one announcement that they made was that they're going to be branching out from their normal games and bring us a sequel to eSports
Awesome.
Wii Sports Resort will be coming to the Wii, and it will be bundled with a brand new accessory that's called the Wii Motion Plus.
And what the Wii Motion Plus will do for your Wii Remote is allow you to actually have one, one...
and DarkSakura.com
It will be coming with one of those and all the other ones will cost you extra money.
I want to see... No, I haven't heard what the price of those were.
Something was $29.99.
Hopefully it wasn't the Wii Motion Plus things.
I'm curious how many games in the future will require this.
WeSportsResort
A jet ski racing game, which I forget what they actually call it.
Looks kind of like, I guess, I don't know.
A jet ski racing game.
It's kind of cool.
Wave Race 64, maybe.
And finally, they had sword fighting in there as well.
Cool!
But they made the swords look like lightsabers, sort of.
Oh my god, lightsabers!
They're giving everyone the Star Wars game they wanted.
Except it's not really lightsabers, it's just...
Big Paul Nerf Sabers Nerf Sabers sounds fun there may be up to 10 games in this pack whenever it's released it's not supposed to be out though until spring of next year so got some time for that you know what's funny though out of all the E3 predictions out there I would think that a sequel to Wii Sports getting announced would be like a so freaking obvious thing I didn't see a lot of people predict that
Well, here's my thing.
It makes sense for them business-wise because you have a problem where people are picking up the Wii and all they're playing is Wii Sports.
So if they want to sell games to this market that's not really buying games, well, their best bet would be to put a sequel out for Wii Sports.
I don't know.
It's definitely going to be selling very well.
I don't know if they're going to convince everybody that bought the Wii with Wii Sports.
It would sell better if they get that crap out by Christmas.
Yeah.
I'm kind of surprised it's not.
Well, I don't know.
It'll be interesting, I guess.
I'll have to check it out when it actually comes out.
Wii Music
Coji Kondo
That's alright, he didn't need to know that part.
But also, you know, you see, and you saw a little bit of this I think at the year's feature on.
Well apparently, 50 instruments are going to be included in this.
You use the remote, you use the nunchuck.
You can also tap your foot on the balance board to kind of simulate a drum set.
Apparently you're going to have violin, guitar, marimba.
I'm hoping there's a sitar in this, but nothing's been said about that yet.
I want a zither.
Or an auto-harp.
Which is kind of sad, in a way, because it's kind of like a good concept.
But it does sound like they took the game out of the game.
And now you have a noise-making device.
Well, here's the thing.
Here's the thing.
Miyamoto came up on stage and said, Who would have thought that we would have sold millions of bathroom scales?
And laughed at it.
You know?
and he laughed at it because you smug asshole and I don't really I'm not seeing that he's laughing at the people that are buying this stuff but
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
This is exactly what you'll be buying with this game.
There's absolutely no way to play the song wrong because all you're doing is tapping buttons and pretending.
You know what's funny though?
I still think this game is going to be huge.
I think there is an audience for this game.
Yes, there is an audience.
It's the casual market that will buy these shitty Destiny games that come out because they look cool and they'll drop $20 on them and the games are absolute shit.
Miyamoto is a genius because, you know, us hardcore gamers, at least, you know, I'm looking at this going, where's the game?
Where's the game?
And they're going to sell millions.
Well, great.
You know, I'm glad that they're going to sell millions to this because, you know, they would sell millions of a good game as well.
And, you know, their loyal fans who buy all these games that come out each time are kind of disappointed.
I know.
I was, like, after watching the whole press conference from Nintendo, I'm like...
That was it?
That was a fucking waste of time.
I have to ask Jamie because she did say she was favorable to the orchestra thing when she saw it, but hearing that they've kind of taken the game out and now you've got a music simulation device, is this still interesting to you?
Yes, very much so.
Sorry, I was a music major.
I was in band.
I would love to get other people together who are likewise musically inclined and see what we can do.
I mean, I loved a lot of the MIDI sims that did that.
I worry, though, that this game isn't going to have that kind of depth.
Like, I would think, especially if you're going to get a bunch of music nerds together to do it, I would think that the game would need more depth, and I worry that this game is not going to have it.
I mean, prove me wrong, Nintendo, please do, but... Jamie, they said that there's no way to play this wrong.
I mean...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You know what?
You did hit on something good, though, is that if it gets more kids interested in music, then it's a good thing.
Because I was a band geek in school.
I would think that they would add in some sort of difficulty or control level, you know?
Add a little bit more freedom in what you're allowed to express with it.
I mean, that was what my thought was.
If there's a didgeridoo in the game, I'm sold, though.
I take back everything I said to play the didgeridoo.
Well, let's just...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't really give a crap about this.
This looks stupid.
And sure enough, they come out on stage during the press conference now, and yeah, it was stupid.
Thank you for totally fulfilling my expectations on this piece of product.
And the other thing about having the one button control is if I'm right, you are the conductor also, right?
I think they have a conductor minigame in there.
As a conductor, though, I can understand having the one-button melody part playing as being conductor because it is the conductor's job to signal when the next part comes in by following along with the music.
So, you know, by reading the score, you have to signal to make sure that, first of all, even though the band is supposed to be keeping up with what's going on, they're supposed to know what you're doing, you still have to signal them, you still control volume, you know, keep the time.
They're going to follow you.
I would expect that that would make sense for a controller mode.
I just worry it's not going to have that kind of depth.
I think it's just going to be, hey, kid, waggle the thing in the air.
You're a conductor.
Whee!
They should have difficulty settings to allow for a broader market to play it.
But there's nothing, there's no on-screen cues, there's nothing.
It's literally, there's a little drum beat going along and you decide whether you want to tap your thing with the song or whatever.
What they should have done, and this could have opened it up for the entire market instead of just... See, that's the problem.
They can't just develop for everybody.
They just want to either develop for the casual market or the hardcore market.
They can't see past developing something that would appeal to both.
DarkSakura.com
And do it that way.
And then if you're not interested in that, that's too complex for you.
You can sit there and tap your finger to the music or whatever.
Well, we need to move on, but I will still close with this.
I don't care if the game is a piece of flaming poo.
If it gets five-year-olds saying, hey, I want to play a real marimba someday or I want to play a real saxophone, French horn, whatever, then it's a good thing.
So we'll see.
I like that you said saxophone and French horn together.
Because they have very complimentary tones.
I pulled instruments out of my ass that I remember from marching band.
You know what game, though, I think they should make that would be a good music game?
What's that?
You know what a theremin is?
No.
It uses analog wave signals to play music.
Like, it's got one that goes out vertically and one that goes up horizontally.
And you use your hands in between the waves.
Oh.
Oh, okay, I've seen that, yes.
You control the music that you play.
One of them is your volume, and the other one is your pitch.
And you can wiggle your fingers a certain way, and it'll do staccato, or do it slowly, it'll be more flowing.
But they should do a game that mimics a theremin.
Wouldn't that be cool?
I gotta get some comments from chat, because you know they're commenting on it.
GS68 says, I want Wee Cowbell.
They have the cowbell in there.
I'm serious.
I'm getting it.
It has a cowbell.
PKJr92 says, Rob, how would you play a didgeridoo with a Wiimote?
I don't know.
How are you going to play all this other shit with a Wiimote?
They'll make it work.
It's Nintendo.
They create miracles every day.
Frisbee says, but those kids aren't going to do that, Rob.
I bet you're wrong.
They say more people are taking guitar lessons because of Guitar Hero, trying to learn how to play the real thing.
I know what you're thinking, Debbie Downer, but I bet you're going to be wrong.
Not to be all pessimistic or anything, but seriously, if you're really excited about Wii Music and you haven't watched the conference yet...
I urge you to at least watch that portion of the Nintendo press conference because you will be disappointed.
I mean, literally, it's just like, ouch.
Alright, new game.
New Nintendo game.
Please.
Stuff.
The game called Nintendo Does Shit is coming out.
No, I'm kidding.
And Nintendo does shit all over your wallet.
It's amazing.
No, it prints money.
This is, though, the happy news, I think, of E3 for a lot of Nintendo fans, is Animal Crossing City Folk, which will be, I mean, basically it's the same sort of graphical style that we know way back in the Nintendo 64 era of Doubutsu no Mori, you know, because that was the first version that came out was on Nintendo 64.
In other words, they added widescreen and that's it.
Pretty much.
Um...
But the neat thing about this one is that you can use your Wii message board to send messages to your friends, and you can put on masks that look like you're me.
That'd be cool.
Especially for whoever gets Goat Say Me.
Hooray.
There is also a microphone option that's called Wii Speak, so you can talk to other players around the world.
And it's just pretty cool.
Cool.
I don't know what to think about this.
I'm excited.
I'm going to buy it.
Getting it.
Granted, I'm getting it.
I have to be able to send nasty messages to villagers everywhere.
I hope it's one of those things where it works a little better in theory.
Because the problem with Animal Crossing DS, the problem with that is that... There's no island!
Well, not just that.
You had to coordinate with people in order to be able to visit their village, which granted was a step up from the GameCube one where they had to actually be at your house.
But I think that's kind of why the DS one lost its charm is they really didn't add that much from the GameCube one and you kind of had to do all this coordination.
I am hoping in this one that it uses that WeConnect24 for a good thing where I can go to people's villages in the middle of the night and steal their fruit.
Plus, I'm hearing they took the whole... Like, you know how there was like a game in it?
Is it the game, in a sense, is to pay back Tom Nook for your house, right?
I'm hearing they took that out.
That there is no game now in Animal Crossing.
It's just do stuff.
No, no, no, no.
They can't take that out.
But I'm thinking since it says City Folk, maybe it's going to be a much...
That is sort of very Japanese, isn't it?
in a way.
It's also kind of lame though, I mean, and I hate to put the specific spin on everything, but here's what they basically did with the city portion.
The city portion, remember how there was little events that would happen at specific times during the week where you would have, I forget the bitch's name, they'd come and try to sell you the expensive...
Sahara?
Yeah, Sahara.
She would sell you the expensive clothing.
She sold the carpets, I'm sorry.
The carpets, okay.
They had the other people that would sell the expensive clothing.
They had the people that would sell the rare furniture and stuff like that.
Well, guess what?
Now you don't have to worry about going to your town specific days.
You just go to the city and it's all there.
I mean, what's the point?
I mean, the whole point is you go back to your town and actually be able to play it and stuff.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Have special festivals, have a carnival maybe, something that happens in your town.
They have very limited objects that you can maybe get like once a month or something.
You know, and this wouldn't be a big surprise for me, but I honestly don't think there's going to be...
There will be hardly any innovation from the GameCube version, let alone the DS version with this version.
They're literally pumping out the same fucking game on every system so far.
I did get the impression this game's kind of already in the can.
That this game's just waiting to be released already.
And, you know, it's not a bad... I mean, the game's good, it's fun, and you'll play it for a while, and then you'll get bored of it like all the other ones, but...
It's like they're not even trying.
It's like, okay, we put out the same game again.
People will buy it.
Let's release it.
I would like to see more things that you have to accomplish with other people.
I think that would be great.
Like you have to do, like in order to get super rare things, you have to work with somebody else.
I mean, because it would give this whole we speak thing a use.
Because right now this thing is screaming gimmick.
Maybe you have a job.
GameGuru says a carnival was confirmed for City Folk.
So that's kind of cool.
Frisbee says there better be a freak show in the carnival.
That would be awesome.
I want to have the bearded lady move to my village.
I want more than four characters in my village, which would be nice.
I also want, say when you're not playing your characters, that they walk around and do stuff, which would be also cool.
I also want to be able to put the Mii masks on the other villagers that are in there in case I don't like their ugly face.
Joshi16 says Animal Crossing is the new Harvest Moon.
If you have some comments you want to have read on air, chat.orangesoundtrader.com when we chat live on these Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific time at allgames.com.
Well, something that, the only thing during the Nintendo press conference that had me excited that this conference actually might turn around was the brief announcement that Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was coming to the DS.
And that is exactly all we know about it, other than it will take place during Liberty City, and...
yeah, it's being worked on no word other than that what exactly this is but I'm excited because it's Grand Theft Auto and then immediately the conference turned around and went back to shit again
PSP PSP PSP
We'll see.
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The rumored prices right now $2.99 for a standard definition rental $6 for a high definition download $14.99 if you want to actually purchase the movie No idea yet about high definition pricing Apparently the store went up right after the conference and you can get such movies as Rambo, Cloverfield, The Bank Job All right there That's cool they needed that But here's a tip Don't get Cloverfield on HD There's no point
They don't sell the movies in HD yet.
Oh, okay, not yet.
But soon.
Soon is the all-encompassing word for us, isn't it?
Well, something else regarding the Wii and what Nintendo's got released is the Wii Speak microphone.
You know, which they brought up the We Speak with Animal Crossing.
But it's called a community microphone.
And it's supposed to sit on top of your infrared bar on top of the TV and bring up basically everything in the room from what I understand.
Hooray, so now everybody in my house can hear the obscenities people are shouting at me on the internet.
Well, it's like a conference phone type of thing.
We'll see, we'll see.
It's an interesting departure from the traditional headset thing, I'll give them that.
I do like that, though.
But I don't know.
I hate wearing headsets.
It's not the device that I'm worried about, it's the implementation of it.
That's the thing.
At least it's not a camera.
I'll give you that.
I'll give you that.
I don't want a camera on my Wii.
Well, also, though, some other interesting news was...
that especially regarding Sony is that they have released information saying that there will be a $399 80 gig PS3 available in September and labeled as the 80 gigabyte core pack.
That actually sounds kind of neat but it's definitely the price drop from the $499 bundle that currently has the 80 gigabyte system.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and the PS3 is getting the same thing.
You're going to have the 399 core system, the 80 gig, which, by the way, does not play any PlayStation 2 games at all.
It has the same backwards compatibility as the 40 gig system.
That's what I was about to say, actually, before you jumped in on what I was saying.
But hey, 40 gig system with a larger hard drive, so that's awesome.
I guess though, having the 80 gig, if you're going to announce this movie thing, I mean, I guess that's what you're going to need the space for, right?
If you're going to download all these movies, then they want you to have the bigger hard drive, right?
So in the end, they win, right?
It makes it a lot more simplified, because if they just leave it at the 80 gig system, you can just do, okay, the PS3 system is $399, if you want this bundle, it's $499.
But it kind of devalues the bundle a bit.
God of War 3
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
All right.
Well, not only did Sony... Actually, I would probably go with the latest because they always seem to delay their releases of stuff.
Well, not only did Sony announce the obvious, which I would say is God of War 3, but they announced something a little bit unexpected, I think.
It has to do with what's a new type of game they're calling a MAG.
A massive action game.
You know how an MMO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game?
Well, this is supposed to be like that, but with an action game.
Apparently, 256 players.
Are there that many people playing online with the PS3 right now?
I don't know, probably.
256 players can actually all play this game at once.
It's just apparently this giant free-for-all type game.
You can get live statistics actually as you're playing.
It does look like a war kind of game and seeing as it is being developed by the folks who make SOCOM, it does make sense.
It's eight player squads is what you're in.
It's kind of interesting.
It's kind of an expansion, I guess, on the 64-player multiplayer for Resistance 2.
We're in squads on that as well.
I said a long time ago on this show, and I'm sure other people have too, we have these massively multiplayer role-playing games.
Where's our massively multiplayer other types of games?
And here you go.
Well, they had Huxley that was supposed to be coming out.
I don't know.
See, that's good, though, that they announced something like that.
Because that's something that Microsoft doesn't have.
That's something that can differentiate themselves.
But, I don't know.
Home is still coming and it supposedly looks a little bit better from what I saw at the press conference thing.
Well, Loki's going to sum up some other E3 highlights for us, but first I just kind of want to go around and get everybody's highlights and lowlights from the press conferences.
Best announcement you heard and worst announcement you heard.
Loki.
The worst announcement I heard was the entire lineup from Nintendo.
Seriously, that press conference was hard to watch.
It
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
um least exciting thing for me is that little motion extra device thing on the Wii because it's just now another piece of crap I'm gonna have to buy because other games are gonna have to implement this because it probably should have been in there in the first place most exciting thing
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
A genuine surprise and something that sounds pretty exciting and different.
And reminds me of the whole Berkeley Systems days.
So I'm going to say that's the most exciting thing I heard in those press conferences.
Loki, any other things from the big three we might have missed?
Okay, starting off here.
There was some Xbox Live Arcade announcements.
Quite a few of them, actually.
Some surprising stuff, too.
They were, of course, showing off Banjo-Kazooie 3 Nuts and Bolts.
Well, another announcement that they made along with that is that the original Banzu Kazooie will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade later this year, which is surprising because that was an Nintendo 64 game.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Castle Crashers, Galaga Legions, Braid, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2,
All going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade within the next four to six weeks.
That's fucking awesome.
Other things, Halo Wars is supposed to be out the first half of 2009.
It looked kind of cool.
There was some other stuff...
Let's see here.
Actually, I want to say that August 6th is when Geometry Wars 2 is going to be coming out, so that's pretty cool.
Not really part of the press conference, but Apogee came back.
Remember them?
They used to do shareware games.
Yes, they were awesome.
Isn't that pronounced Apogee?
I think it is Apogee.
Jill of the Jungle, like what?
Well, they're bringing Duke Nukem to the handhelds.
Which made me ask, where the fuck's Dick Dinkum Forever?
Bastards.
But, that was interesting.
They showed off a Resistance Fall of Man PSP game.
That's due out spring of 2009.
It's going to be kind of like the Killzone PSP game, so that's kind of interesting.
And this is going to make you very happy, Rob, actually.
Well, not really.
There's rumors that that MotionPlus controller add-on that they're going to have, yeah, eventually it's going to be integrated into the Wii Remote.
Shock.
So yeah, all that money wasted.
for stuff that should have been there in the first place.
I just glanced at Justin.TV.
I forgot about this one.
Did you see the Sony game Fat Princess?
Farmboy44 in the Justin.TV chat says that.
That game looks hilarious.
That does look funny.
And then I want to say that... I'm trying to think what else that was really cool coming out of there.
I don't know, some of the gameplay stuff that they're showing off, like Resident Evil 5 looked kind of neat with the co-op and stuff that they announced that you can do there.
And, um...
I don't know.
The PlayStation Home stuff looked alright.
The one cool thing that really impressed me, though, about the PlayStation conference was that they showed off... Actually, part of their presentation was done in LittleBigPlanet.
And it was really cool.
That was cool.
I saw a little bit of that.
That's neat.
See, that's how you make their conferences interesting, okay?
That game has me absolutely excited.
Can't wait to play that.
October for that one, at least.
And...
I wanna say that was pretty much it.
There was really, you know, no big game announcements as far as, like, DS stuff, I think.
I mean, everyone was expecting, like, I think they announced a new Pokemon Rangers game, which is just whoop-de-doo.
No Pokemon Platinum announcement, even though we know that's coming.
But, you know, once again, Nintendo said that this E3 conference was not about the core gamers, it was about casual gamers, which...
and DarkSakura.
If we didn't take a minute to pay some respect to our elders in gaming.
And DarkSakura, having gone to California Extreme, I'm sure must have been inspired from hundreds of games this week.
I actually didn't see this one there, though.
Wow.
I was a little disappointed.
Huh.
All right.
So we have something completely, I guess, outside of the realm of what you saw.
Just something you were hoping and thinking about this week.
So it must be pretty darn good.
Let's take a look.
It's the classic game of the week.
What should the kids be playing this week?
The game of the week is Kicks, which is one of my all-time, all-time favorite games ever, which became also the model for later stuff like Galactica.
Hell yeah!
Woo!
You hear the sounds?
This is what you got when you played.
It was this little vector series of lines that would move across an empty rectangular space, and you were a dot.
It's like Attack of the Windows screensavers.
And what you had to do is box in to gain a super majority of the screen.
So you also had these little spark things though that would travel on your lines that you would form to box in the kicks.
and, um, it would, uh, if it hit you, it would destroy you.
Also, if the kicks hit the line that you were drawing, it would also destroy you, and you did have a timer, too.
So, your whole, um, the whole point of the game was to claim, um, a certain percentage of the screen.
Um...
I've actually managed to get the 95 percentile closure on the screen before just by making a trap box.
It requires some pretty good strategy to do well.
But there's also a...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Also, as you progress through the game, you would actually get two kicks on the screen, which you could actually easily pass the level if you could bisect the screen so that one was on either side.
It really is a lot harder than it sounds.
It's a very difficult game past the first couple of stages, but it's one of my all-time favorites.
It really is.
It's pretty awesome.
Have you ever played Super Kicks?
No, I've not.
They have it available on MAME.
That's the only way I've played it.
A little more graphics in it.
But kind of fun.
The versions of Kicks that I have is the Atari 5200 version and the Nintendo version of Kicks.
Alright.
It's really so simple and very frustrating.
I'm going to beat these stupid lines into a circle.
Yeah, I remember in Super Kicks you'd get letters that you would actually unveil if you siphoned off certain parts of the screen.
It's kind of interesting.
But in the way that this, though, has been incorporated into, like, Gals Panic is, you know, uncovering certain portions of the screen instead of, you know, covering them with your blocks.
And you get to see some boobies if you uncover the right part of the screen.
Like in Miss World 96 Nude.
Yes.
Which you know is a OLR favorite.
Yes.
All right.
No, but the old school kicks is pretty awesome.
All right.
One other thing.
The versions that are out, by the way, is Atari 5200, Commodore 64, DOS, Amiga, which is graphically enhanced, Apple IIGS, Game Boy.
I actually do have the Game Boy version now that I'm thinking about it.
NES and Atari Lynx.
There was a port for the Game Boy Color that was called Kix Adventure.
I don't know if you're saying that it's on GameTap right now.
And you can also find it emulated on multiple systems and get Taito Legends 2 and Taito Legends Power-Up on PSP.
Actdeft says, Kicks for Xbox Live Arcade.
Dude, yes.
But you were mentioning Super Kicks.
There's Kicks 2 Tournament in 1982 and Super Kicks that you were talking about.
And there's Twin Kicks that was a prototype as of 1995 that never came out.
However, there is a main release that you can play.
And then there was Volfield, but it was Ultimate Kicks Neo on PlayStation 4.
So there's also, of course, cell phone versions.
And as I was saying before, Gal's Panic was also based off of Kix.
It's almost a dead clone of it, except for boobs.
Capcoma Night in Busyland, which was on SNES.
Jezball Sonics, Eric's Stix, Ultimate Kix.
There's actually a minigame version in Bully.
And Stix Reloaded, which was a freeware version, were all knockoffs of Kix.
So plenty of ways to get your kicks on.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
And if you're listening on the podcast, that means just let it keep playing because we're going to take a quick commercial break.
Actually, we're calling them not commercial breaks because they're just not paid stuff.
I want to say with that, too.
Well, I'll explain at the beginning of part B. We're accepting your contributions for this.
So what's the antonym of commercial?
I'm not sure.
Public service announcement?
Anti-commercial?
Anti-commercial?
Non-commercial?
They're non-commercial breaks.
Yes, they're indie commercial breaks.
I don't know.
Commercial means pretty much something for money, right?
They're free breaks.
Free breaks!
Yes, we're going to take a free break.
There we go.
We're going to take a free break.
Just to explain really quickly, it's probably the only time I'm going to mention that.
For those of you on the podcast, you will only hear our original...
and the promos on the free break.
For those of you that are listening live tonight, you're going to hear a song or two as well because we actually need to take a stretch break, get some water and all that good stuff so you get a little bit longer when you're listening live.
But we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

Elf needs food badly, so please, think twice before shooting food this holiday season.
The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault!
Remember, don't shoot food.
From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes...
Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix
That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, animal-pissing, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.
You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts.
When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer.
I'm down on my knees.
I'm staying in.
I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.
DarkSakura?
Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a bonfire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.
Sorry.
You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.
Don't get strung out by the way I look.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
John DMN Bressler.
You ever go to Duck Island?
Your mom goes to Duck Island.
And a ton of license music inspired by the show that the RIAA and Laura Steele UT don't want you to hear.
Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.
So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd.
When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.
It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.
But I poop from there.
And it's only from the Nintendo Wii.
So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a WorldCorp breach, bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
If you do, Loki might dress up as Tim.
Not a guarantee.
Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.
To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.
Well, except that asshole.
And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.
There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.
Someone get the hook.
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
This lovely July 20th, 2008.
Jamie has a very perplexed look on her face.
It looks like she swallowed a fly.
I'm twitching.
I hope she won't die.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
Rob can count.
I can.
I'm a winner.
Alright, more news from E3 that didn't necessarily directly have to do with the press conference.
Loki, start us off.
There was an announcement.
I don't know why they decided to cut this because it's... I don't know.
It seems kind of no-brainer to me that I would announce this during an E3 press conference.
There was a new Halo game that they were going to be announcing, but we didn't have time.
That was literally the excuse.
We didn't have time.
Um...
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I think they should do a new Halo game based off of Red vs. Blue, which would be fucking awesome.
There you go.
Alright, so in all seriousness, a Halo announcement gets pulled for time.
Wow, what the heck?
Did they maybe just not have enough to go off of?
Maybe this game is just way too early in development?
Are they sitting on it for PAX?
Are they waiting for the giant orgasm that will fill the Seattle Convention Center when that's announced?
Do I smell Omegathon?
Well, it might be a little early for that.
I don't know about that.
Dude, we get to watch a Megathon this year.
That's going to be kind of rad.
We'll have to sign up for a Megathon if we can.
You can't.
It's randomly chosen out of people that pre-register.
Damn it.
And I think if we did get in as press... Yeah, we probably wouldn't get to do that.
But if we don't get in as press, then that's disappointing.
Because even they have denied us.
Well, look, anyhow, so maybe this Halo game is just being waited on until later, but when later is, who knows?
Maybe they'll just sit on it until next year when there's actually more game to show.
Because even if they did announce it, I'm sure it's not a game coming out until 2010.
We'll see.
A game we had no idea was coming out here at Orange Launch Radio.
This completely took me by surprise that E3 was Dead Rising for the Wii.
I don't know about you guys, but I was just, like, floored by this announcement.
What?
I've never heard of this before.
Dead Rising for the Wii?
I know.
That's just insane.
All right.
That's such an...
I had never heard that on this show.
Now you're going to have sub-missions that you beat in the game, and then you'll do a major plotline quest.
So now the game has become a little more linear.
But some people actually think that might be a good thing, because some people thought the 360, the way it was done there, was a little bit frustrating.
The camera apparently has now been changed, and now it's a behind-and-above type view, more like what they had in Resident Evil 4.
So now it's kind of like one of those over-the-shoulder things.
And the photo mode is now gone, so you can't take the pictures.
I won't miss it.
It was a little silly anyway.
It was fun for a minute.
As long as you can still run over zombies with a lawnmower, I'm happy.
That's really all you need to make Dead Rising.
And please God, save the save system.
No, fix the save system.
Please.
Dead Rising Wii coming out soon.
And by soon he means January.
Well, you know, and I remember Bobby actually mentioning this on his show earlier, but there's some higher-ups that hate E3.
Hate it, hate it, hate it the way it is.
I like to consider myself one of those higher-ups, but apparently I'm the only one that does that.
Well, it was actually stated by the EA big guy.
Okay, now I'm going to totally butcher his last name.
His first name is John.
It's Riccitello, I think.
Whatever.
Anyway, he's quoted as saying, I hate E3 like this.
And that they want to go back to the old E3 or do their own private events.
And the Ubisoft director, well, the Ubisoft boss said, yeah, it was terrible.
Yeah.
In fact, to quote him, he said, E3 this year was terrible.
The world used to come to E3, now it's like Pipefitter's show in the basement.
Funny that the EA guy would be complaining, seeing as, well, EA was one of the four major companies that approached the ESA and said, we want you to change E3 because we don't like it the way it is.
They're never satisfied.
They don't know what they want.
They're like little kids.
Well, there was, it actually was Ubisoft, someone from Ubisoft named Alain Cor was also, you know, saying that he didn't really care for it all that either too.
But one of the things that I think should be pointed out is that
While they were the ones that wanted it, I think they didn't expect it to turn out the way that it did.
I think that it was such a drastic departure that they are just now beginning to see to them what would be a detriment.
One thing that I think was pointed out by Corey is that he's saying it's one milestone in the communication of your products throughout the year and it's important because it's the ramp on for Christmas.
But he had said that in mid-July, that wouldn't be something appropriate.
Now, what I'm thinking is that if they wanted their big event, they should do something closer to the end of the year.
You know, have E3 be your meetings and everything, and then do E3 to the sequel in November or something.
Which is what E4ALL was supposed to be.
But people didn't see it that way.
It should still be the same E3, I think.
The same format as before.
Yeah.
EA still kind of strikes me as the Goldilocks of the game industry right now.
This convention is too big.
This convention is too small.
They're looking for a convention that's just right.
But, you know, I don't know.
All that aside, I just think publishers in part, the people that were going to E3, are partially to blame for why E3 went in the crapper.
I mean, the year Paris Hilton showed up at E3, that was the year I was like, something ain't right.
I just can't believe the people who actually wanted to go see her.
So honestly, blame yourselves for ruining E3.
I think if they're going to bring E3 back on a big spectacle, which it seems like maybe EA is going to start bullying them to do it, have some freaking responsibility with what you decide to show at these shows.
I don't care if Paris Hilton has a cell phone game coming out.
Keep her the fuck out of my show.
I think that what they should do if they're going to have the celebrity events like that, they put them in the...
What was the other hall that the little games had to hang out in?
Kensha.
Yeah, they need to hang out there.
I don't have a problem with them bringing celebrities or even non-celebrities like Paris Hilton because you know what?
That's up to the game publishers how they want to promote their game and stuff.
And if they want to do that, fine.
You don't have to go see it.
It's whatever.
Um...
I do think, though, that they have to figure out what the hell they're trying to actually accomplish with E3 because the whole thing before was it's getting crazy because there's too many people here and we can't get business done.
Well, now that it's more intimate, are you getting business done?
Obviously, you're not satisfied the way it is, then what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
I think once they figure that out, you know, maybe, I don't know, let's not take such extremes.
Maybe we just keep it the way it used to be, but, I don't know, make it slightly more restrictive on who gets in.
I don't know.
What they need to do is just find a happy medium.
Alright.
Well, let's move on.
So, other EA-related news is that EA formed a partnership now with id Software.
And, of course, that also means that their brand new first-person shooter title, Rage, is going to be published by EA.
So, that's kind of neat.
Some other... I wonder if that also includes Doom 4, which...
I don't think they actually announced anything for that.
Interesting.
But yet another big developer to get under their EA belt.
Hopefully do something with it.
Slowly this big collective is being built even more and more.
You will be assimilated into the big EA.
One thing that's not getting assimilated to EA though, because this is a Konami thing, this is Gradius Rebirth.
This is kind of interesting.
It's almost as if Mega Man 9 was just the beginning, because now apparently there's this new Gradius game that's going to be coming out for the Wii on WiiWare.
I mean, no news yet if it's going to come out for Xbox and PlayStation Network as well, like Mega Man 9 is supposed to be.
But apparently, Gradius Rebirth is going to be coming out on the Japanese Wii systems around this summer, probably next month or so.
But it's apparently what this game is.
If it's a remake of Gradius 1 or if it's a new Gradius game, that quite is not known just yet.
The old school Gradius, though, is already available on the virtual console.
So I would think this is some type of new adventure maybe based on the old Gradius.
But, you know, this is kind of one of those series that people said they were kind of sad when it died.
Like there was the one, there was what, Gradius 5 on the PlayStation 2?
That was pretty cool.
And then it kind of disappeared.
Jamie, I know you're a big Gradius fan.
Is this something you're excited about?
Anything Gradius we get.
And it even has the Moai heads in it, which is pretty rad.
You can't have Gradius without Moai heads.
Absolutely.
So that's going to be pretty cool.
Coming out in Japan this summer, and I'm imagining America soon enough.
In other news, I guess sort of related to the Wii, this was actually supposed to go with my previous story about the status of E3.
But Miyamoto is quoted as saying that E3 is no longer where they're going to be showing off games for the core audience.
And we did mention this earlier in the show.
Yeah.
but he said that he's quoted as saying that for a very long time E3 was an event where I guess the developers catered specifically to the core gamer so they're actually using it as something to bounce off the mass public the casual gamer their new market that they're trying to get a hold of
But he said that E3 isn't the right place to point out their classics like Zelda or their major titles that have been their staple that their fans actually care about.
and I'll see you next time.
F you to the woman who nearly ran into my car on Friday.
I was coming out of the parking lot to turn right onto the road so that I could go back to work and this woman turns directly into my car trying to pull into the entrance side of this little, you know, entrance leading back onto the road and lo and behold the bitch was on her phone.
And Julie and I rolled down the windows and said, hang up your goddamn phone.
And she looked confused.
And I was like, bitch, if both of your hands had been on the wheel, you could have controlled the wheel enough to turn it in all the way.
It was very clear she was trying to turn the wheel with her hand and her elbow.
Like, bitch, your phone conversation is not worth, you know, risking my life over.
Hang up your goddamn phone.
The end.
Anyways, F you to stupid people at movie theaters who get there either at the time of the showing or five minutes prior to it and expect to find a good seat, especially when people have sat down and have maybe one seat next to them and they want you to move over.
You know what?
I didn't get to the movie 50 minutes early just to have some idiot come right on time and tell me the move because you don't want to sit up front.
Well, tough.
You know what?
If I got to the movie right as it's starting, then I expect to sit in the front and you should too.
So fuck you inconsiderate bitches.
And she was a fat cow too.
She was playing with her cell phone during the movie.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm like, okay, so I get to decide if I have surgery or not.
That's kind of neat, I guess.
So I decide I'm going to go get a second opinion because I can't make decisions by myself.
But the other one is that I've decided I kind of have too many hobbies going on right now.
So I've made a difficult decision that I'm going to be cutting one of them out.
It's not this one, don't worry.
But it's always difficult because that kind of...
What's the best way to do it?
I gotta do what I gotta do So
It's not Warcraft either, sorry.
Oh, I was going to say... No, it's not Warcraft.
No, no, no.
Alright, it doesn't matter.
It's not the guessing game.
It's something.
It's something big that I'm going to hate to get away from, but I have to do it for me.
I'll tell you later.
Okay.
I couldn't read your lips.
Alright.
Alright, so that's it for the FUs of the Week.
Um...
Other people are quitting WoW.
I'm not.
I still love WoW.
WoW's great, but I don't play it every day anymore.
I play once in a while.
Apparently somebody out there was actually listening to me or at least thought the same thing when I saw the movie Wanted.
They are bringing a Wanted game out to the market.
Universal and Grin are working on a Wanted game and it will allow you to do all the fun stuff like curving bullets and going into assassin time as they call it.
Only sad thing though is it's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
I was really hoping for a Wii Wanted game because...
I really think that'd be cool, especially with the new Motion Plus.
Now you could attach that to the bottom of your, you know, Nyko Perfect shot and curve the bullets that way, but whatever.
So it'll be cool, though.
Worth checking out.
Hopefully it'll be out around the time when the DVD comes out, which is holiday, maybe, but, you know, if we're just seeing it now and it hasn't been developed for a while, it could be crap.
Scares me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
In the game, apparently, there's going to be PvP achievements, PvE achievements, achievements for exploring the world, achievements for crafting, achievements for questing and developing a character.
I mean, all these different things.
But what I like is that some of the achievements are silly.
There's an achievement that you can unlock for giving 10 hugs.
to other players.
So if you're just a hug slut, you get an achievement for that, which is kind of funny, I think.
Apparently there are really, really, really difficult achievements as well called Feats of Strength.
So, interesting.
I'm assuming this is all going to be able to be tracked on Blizzard's website and the Armory and all that fun stuff too, but my question is what about all the stuff I've already done?
Is WoW going to be capable of knowing that I've done all this stuff on my current level 70?
Because that's going to
Well, that's how they're doing the PlayStation trophies is even if you've done this crap, it's not going to be able to know based on your save game.
You have to go back and actually do it again.
Right, right.
You know, other websites, I was going to say Newgrounds kind of does something similar with their Flash games.
Actually, all the Flash games have kind of trophies built into it and stuff.
So that's kind of neat that they do that too.
And, you know, I think while doing it, it's...
Thank you for watching!
Well, something else that's fairly cool, and this actually has to do with Silent Hill Homecoming.
They were actually showing that there will be our good buddy with the red pyramid hanging out
in part of Silent Hill Homecoming and that it's going to have a PC version.
So, that's pretty cool.
Just like, I guess, the ones before it except for the very first one.
But that's pretty cool information.
I mean, he would have to be...
PYRAMID HEAD
I was actually going to ask you about that.
Are you going to forgive it for maybe bending the lore in Silent Hill to give the fans service of having Red Pyramid, Pyramid Head, whatever in the game?
We did have some reoccurring critters.
Certain same types of things.
As long as he rapes things.
Pyramid Head, for those who don't know, he goes around having his way with the female creatures of the town of Silent Hill including the double-sided mannequins and the nurses and then he goes around stabbing random women who keep regenerating.
I need to watch the Silent Hill movie again.
God, it was great.
Come over to my house and watch it.
Seriously, I want to watch it on Blu-ray.
I bet it's pretty.
I need to get it.
You don't have it on Blu-ray?
No, I want it, and my husband's a butthole.
He has it on Blu-ray.
Can we watch it on Blu-ray once?
I mean, I love my husband very much.
He's not always a butthole.
We did it at your apartment, your old apartment.
I don't think we watched the whole thing.
Yeah.
We can bring it over.
But I've got, like, the Humongoy TV.
We need Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Night.
Okay.
Okay.
Maybe that should be a holiday.
An official holiday of Orange Sounds Radio.
I hear the creepy rabbits from number two, I think, are back.
That's cool.
We have to also have nurses.
We have to have nurses.
And I want the screaming things.
I would ask the chat room, what day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?
Not Halloween.
That's too obvious.
Some other day.
What day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?
So we'll see.
Tuesday.
September 12th.
Why is that?
I don't know.
The day after your birthday?
Yeah.
Well, you could do it.
How about the release date of Silent Hill Homecoming?
Oh, there you go.
Or the day before.
What was the day that Silent Hill 2 came out?
I don't know.
I'll have to look that up.
That should be Pyramid Head.
I will look that up and we will dub that Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
I will look that up right now while we get into another story.
Okay.
Awesome.
Well, this is kind of weird and it may not actually be a confirmation at all, but apparently there are some people that performed some sort of social engineering prank that had 2K Games support believing that there is a hacked version of Grand Theft Auto 4's PC version, at least a demo of it, on a pirate site.
and apparently there was some back and forth going on with the tech support.
The PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4 has not even been announced for release and is still in development.
So it's not about to be released on a website.
Well, people are reading into that thinking, well, it's still in development.
Well, that kind of confirms that it's actually coming out.
But the whole thing is, does really their tech support know anything about games in development?
I don't know.
Maybe.
I mean, I would think it'd be kind of dumb if they didn't put out a PC version.
And I know the last few PlayStation 2 games have been on, you know, PC.
So, why not?
So maybe it's coming.
Just might take some time.
Alright, and I'm sure that makes a lot of people very happy.
Especially because PC means easily hackable.
Exactly.
It means mod crazy.
Mod crazy.
Alright, here we go.
Here's the answer to the question.
We did the research.
Silent Hill 2 was released in North America.
Believe it or not, North America got it first.
Japan got it three days later.
September 24th, 2001.
Too bad it's not the 23rd.
You know, it's funny.
September 24th, I think, is very close, if not the exact release date of Homecoming.
Interesting.
Well, there you have it.
So I guess that's it.
So do we officially... No, September 24th is a Wednesday this year.
So it might be like September 23rd.
Or that might be the day you actually can get it in a store.
If it's the 23rd, then we have the number of consequence.
24th can be a release date.
Games mostly come out on Wednesdays.
It's like a street date.
I mean, they have the ship date, but you know.
Whatever.
I think we... But we have the official word.
September 24th is Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
Official.
Done.
Done deal.
Sign.
Get the wax.
Let's get the seal, the OLR seal.
That's in our new universe of Orange Loungia.
All right.
I like that, Orange Loungia.
How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?
You can't tell them to rape things because, unfortunately, rape is not funny.
You can just have them put on a big cardboard pyramid on their head and walk around with like, since you know it's really hard to find a great knife like that, walk around with a plastic knife.
Walk around the neighborhood and threaten the cats in your neighborhood.
Hold a plastic knife.
You have to have a plastic knife.
And take pictures.
Bake pyramid head cakes.
Yes, bake pyramid head cakes.
That's it.
Pyramid head cupcakes and pass them out to the neighbors.
And they have to be red velvet.
All right, so we want pictures of you celebrating Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
And the best cupcake wins.
Something.
Wins eaten by the hosts.
You know what would be awesome?
What?
If we had a lot of money.
I mean, a lot, a lot of money.
What?
You get Charm City Cakes to build you a sculpture of Pyramid Head as a cake.
Great.
I have a friend that makes wedding cakes.
That wouldn't be too bad.
Shaoran in chat says, can I wear my pyramid-shaped tinfoil hat instead?
You certainly can.
But we want pictures.
I like that.
Pyramid-shaped cupcakes.
You could do that.
I mean, just kind of take a cupcake and kind of either...
You can make your own molds.
But no, seriously, contest.
Dun-da-dun.
And the rules are whatever we decide they are at the time.
One of them is a costume contest for your best, not necessarily cosplay, but just your best celebration of Pyramid Head.
And the second one is how pretty your cupcakes are.
I don't know if Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day is that PC.
I mean...
Who cares?
Maybe rape victims might be offended by that.
Yeah, I know.
We might be offending some people.
Okay, it's just Red Pyramid Day.
Or Pyramid Head Appreciation Day would be fine.
Red Pyramid Day.
Rape of people is not funny.
Rape of monsters is funny.
Because monsters are bad.
And when bad people... What?
I'm just not going to keep going down this line.
Let go of the shovel.
Yeah, I'm digging myself a hole.
How about... What?
Pyramid Head Day.
What?
I still like Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day, but only when it rapes monsters.
How about the rape appreciation event?
You know what they should do?
We should have a rape carnival.
Wouldn't that be cool?
Is the mold your own custom, like... Or I can see the hate mail coming from a mile away.
We should mold our, like, custom, like...
We need your ideas of how to turn this into a politically correct event.
There's no way, Rob.
Shaoran says, I'm offended.
Some of my best friends are monsters.
You asshole.
And no, Joshi16, there will not be a rape-a-thon this part of the day.
This is horrible.
No, it's going to be Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
Alright.
We'll figure something out.
Okay.
Anyhow, in a completely different topic, I'm sure there'll be a lot of appreciation for this as well.
It has been announced that BioWare and LucasArts, they are building the MMO for Knights of the Old Republic.
Now, this is different from the existing Star Wars MMO, but there is that new Knights of the Old Republic MMO that's going to be going on.
It's pretty cool, and you can see this whole thing that's posted, I guess it's on Portfolio.com, and it has been confirmed this is Knights of the Round...
I'm sorry, Knights of the Round Republic.
That would be awesome.
Knights of the Round, the old Capcom game.
Knights of the Old Republic is online.
It's Knights of the Old Old Republic.
Shut up.
I cannot think of Kotor without thinking of my friend who tested it and what they called it in office.
Who was that?
Skrotor.
Nice.
Very nice.
So, there you have it.
That game will be coming probably in a couple years.
It's probably still a little ways out, but I'm sure there's lots of people that are waiting to ditch WoW for that.
It'll be good times.
Alright, anyhow, we're going to get into another segment here on Orange Launch Radio that's good times because it's the chance for us to hear from the listeners.
It's the Mailbag segment.
Every week we invite your emails at Mailbag, OrangeLaunchRadio.com and let's read some of those emails right now.
Uh, emails.
We have some.
The end.
Wait, can I jump in here?
Because there's a great idea from Ossifer in chat.
Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
The day that people across the world wear pyramid hats and rip skin off their fried chicken.
It says ripping skin off chicks.
Yeah, but it's chicken.
So that way it's politically correct.
I think Ossifer set a good starting point.
I think there's a good idea in there somewhere.
Anyway, sorry, mail.
From Rob with two B's.
A deer, two guys, a girl, and an olive garden, home of the never-ending salad and breadsticks.
Is it me or is the news from E3 much more boring this year?
One of the things that was a new Wiimote Shun add-on that more accurately judges the controller's aspect.
Isn't this a more or less throw-out to your old plastic thingies?
It won't fit onto the zapper so maybe you won't need it for older games but there will have to be a new zapper.
Are two zappers truly better than one?
No.
Or you can buy the Nyko Perfect Shot and then slap it into the pass-through in the bottom.
Not that both games will probably be using the thing at the same time.
Or you could just save yourself the money and not buy a zapper because they're shit.
I actually don't agree that E3 was necessarily disappointing.
I think especially at Microsoft's camp, I think they did just fine.
I mean, you knew that nobody was going to be announcing a new system this year, and I think the only thing that made Microsoft's press conference a little bit, we knew that was coming, was because of the leak that had already happened.
I think if you hadn't known about the avatars in advance, I think it would have been a pretty big deal to see that new dashboard for the first time.
And even still, we didn't know that the new dashboard was coming, we just knew that avatars were coming.
True, true.
and the other thing too is I like the format of the new E3 with all the press conferences because it's very much like gamers days and I think it's a lot easier to digest the information unless of course you're doing Capcom's press conference where all they do is talk about the fucking Lost Planet movie but no information out of that but I like the old show floor of the original E3 so if we can kind of do both that'd be awesome
Well, you notice that when we went to press events our last year of going, they were sort of off in those little rooms where they had the little trailer area set up inside the show floor.
I loved it.
When we got to go to Bethesda's thing, that was great.
I loved Bethesda's area.
They were so nice.
It was just because it was chill.
And I really actually liked PlayNC.
Everybody that let us in, I just distinctly remember Bethesda because they had a lot of stuff I was kind of interested in at the time.
Call of Cthulhu.
Where's that?
I think any company, even at the old E3, kind of getting off the main floor into those little back rooms and stuff was kind of neat.
Call of Cthulhu came out in 2005 on the Xbox.
I completely missed it.
Well, I don't think anyone missed it.
I remember being so excited and then I never heard anything about it.
Well, to make it up, there is a new Cthulhu movie coming out that stars Tori Spelling.
Unfortunately, not as Cthulhu, but you know.
And she has a small part.
Oh, okay, so she's just a cameo.
Maybe she dies really well.
Anyway.
Maybe she's Cthulhu, I don't know.
Cthulhu.
Anyway, Uber email, really long, and this comes from GS191, and it's really long.
I read the first two paragraphs or something.
Well, it's really long.
Hello there.
It's been a while since I've written anything to you all.
Nevertheless, I'm still an avid listener of the show, even though I haven't been able to be in the chat room in quite a while.
You can blame my World of Warcraft guild and them pushing me to level my Gnome Mage to 70 so they can get another crowd controller in the group.
Go figure.
Anyway, after sitting through all the big three E3 press conferences, I do have some choice words about all of them.
By the way, I have to give many grats to G4 for showing all of the E3 press conferences for the big three with no commercials.
I must say, it was quite nice to see them on a 50-inch plasma TV, but standard definition for the loose.
To be honest, it would be better just to stream them.
I heard that they cut away for the Final Fantasy XIII announcement to show the audience.
Instead of, you know, viewing the wonderful trailer for Final Fantasy XIII.
They actually had to, because there was a little thing that came up on the screen.
I don't know if you saw it.
It got leaked out somewhere.
There was a little thing on the screen that said, please do not videotape the following trailer.
So I think they had to.
Yet there is video footage of it.
Well, that was Square's thing, not G4's probably.
Yeah.
Well, just in general, from what I'm seeing about the Microsoft one, is that I guess he seems pretty happy about Fallout 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, saying that they did a good job showing it and being excited about Final Fantasy XIII.
I'm actually going to post this email also in our forum.
So I'll put a link to it in the chat room later on.
But it's a fairly lengthy email, but I think it makes some very, very good points.
And, of course, Sony is having their demo of Resistance 2 and LittleBigPlanet demo and that type of stuff.
So I'm going to be actually posting this in its entirety on the forum.
So, in a minute.
Awesome.
It is really long.
Hey, Ossifer's building on the idea.
Now, this could be for the Pyramid Head Carnival, okay?
Gaming events for the Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
Spin the Pyramid, Silent Hillopoly, Sorry, You Got Raped, and Twisted Pyramid.
Twister, but in more compromised positions.
I do, though, have to read the closure to his letter.
What's that?
It's from MichaelGS191.
This email is brought to you by the never-ending disappointment that is Nintendo.
Where's my fucking Star Fox remake for the Wii?
Or F-Zero.
Get in line.
Well, continuing on, shall I?
You shall.
Into other email adventures.
This is actually from Sauce.
Hey guys, gals, and ferrets.
Wait, wait, wait, where's the ferret?
The question, where's the ferret?
You had the ferret earlier.
The ferret was snuggling in my boobs.
I see.
Ah!
Is that how you lost it?
No, I was actually sitting on it.
I come bearing another video game review to add to the OLR collection, this time the game of choice is God of War, Chains of Olympus.
I'm including a link to the review for the chatroom's reading pleasure, which I will link in the chatroom momentarily.
The short version of the review is that Chains of Olympus is a fun, non-stop, action-packed game worth playing for any God of War fan or any fan of hack-and-slash violence.
It has excellent graphics and sound and is definitely worth the play.
Anyone interested in keeping up with my video game reviews or articles about comics and movies, as are the three industries are very much tied into one another, can follow me on Twitter under MarrenMarvel for updates.
Keep up the good job, OLR.
Maybe someday Skye and I will rock the boat and you'll see the reviews on the OLR website.
Winky face.
Someday.
Sincerely, Lauren.
I'm going to link it in the chat room in just a sec.
Yes, I need to read it still.
I'm kind of curious.
I'm curious to hear what she thinks of it because I don't know if she's a huge God of War fan, so I'm kind of curious what she thinks of the PSP one.
So, we'll see.
The chat room has now been officially linked.
So, last email, which came very last minute.
Also, Rob with 2B sent me other emails, but I'm going to save those for being related to last minute story stuff.
They're pretty cool things.
Hey, OLR!
I got the Orange Box for PS3 a couple of days ago.
I can't believe I waited so long for such a great game.
Even though I haven't played the original Half-Life, the story is still pretty easy to follow.
And it's kind of fun to guess what happened before, plus it looks amazing.
Portal also made me smile at the sly remarks, but I have to say, playing the Flash game first makes the first bunch of levels much easier.
If anyone hasn't picked it up yet, do so immediately.
Preferably not now, but maybe...
Tomorrow during AGI since you won't miss the whole show.
Miss a whole lot in the 20 minutes it takes to get it.
I'm listening to the show right now and I hope that... Let me start over.
I hope I can get Skype to work this time.
Anyway, I look forward to the show.
Thanks for reading this email.
If you don't read this email, then I guess there's no point in me thanking you.
So if you don't, no thanks.
and SincerelyPKJr92.
This email is sponsored by everything and everyone else not yet mentioned, so now if you sign your emails, you'll be pirating my right to beat that.
Alrighty then.
It's dot com.
Is that it?
Yes.
Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
Email us some stuff.
Try to not make it so epic though because then we don't have time to read it on air so we have to post it in the forums.
Not that that's a bad thing but you know keep it concise.
We like concise emails.
Moving on with some gaming news, right, Loki?
Yes.
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
There's been some more details unveiled about the game, including that it will have 20-plus characters and download content as well.
Of course, they didn't really say too much else other than they were going to be splitting up the roster with DC and Mortal Kombat characters.
There's also...
Fatalities or Brutalities I guess for the Villains that are going to be in it So if you're playing as DC villains You can kill people but The DC heroes will not be able to kill people They'll just only maim I think No It depends which Batman we're getting Adam West's Batman never really killed anyone Wonder Woman killed someone With her bare hands Actually I do believe that Adam West should be in this game That would Sell it for me but
Adam West, Batman should totally be in this game.
Either way, you can expect this game in November.
Cool.
Well, Harmonix has given us a few details this E3 about the Rock Band 1 compatibility in Rock Band 2.
Of course, Rock Band 2 was a game that caught a lot of people's attention at E3 this year, and it's already kind of sneaking out there.
They showed the game at some side parties that were held and things.
It sounds kind of cool.
and one of the rumors out there was that you were going to be able to have all your Rock Band 1 tracks in Rock Band 2 and it turns out, true statement.
Apparently, what happens is that you're not going to be able to transfer all the songs because apparently...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
apparently though you are going to have to pay a small fee like maybe like a $5 fee to transfer the songs over but I still think it's kind of neat because man if you add like you know 60 songs from Rock Band 1 or however many you know they end up having and then your download tracks and the Rock Band 2 that's a lot of freaking songs seriously a lot of freaking songs so there you have it
Rock Band 2 songs and Rock Band 1 songs together in one roof.
Amazing.
That's how they should be doing it.
Yeah.
Well, in other news, there is a date out for Play TV, something that's going to record your TV shows while you're gaming.
It's coming out in Europe from September to December, the first release date being the 10th of September for the UK.
It's a DVR that adds on to the PlayStation 3, so you can use it while you're playing something that you just happen to really be into to record whatever...
You know, a show that happens to be coming on while you're busy, you know, killing people in your game.
You know, kudos for them for making an add-on for the PS3, but isn't that just a VCR?
It's TiVo!
But you can still record, I mean, like, if you're playing a video game, you can still record stuff on your TV, you just have it record off of a different channel.
It's just like, remember how with the old VCRs you could watch one show while recording another?
I don't know.
It's TiVo.
If it fills your need, I guess.
They've also got release dates for Australia and New Zealand around January.
We're having fun network issues in-house again.
Live listeners are noticing that Justin.TV went down again and I think we're just going to pull the plug on that for the night.
Bye-bye.
Sorry.
But we don't know how else to fix our network issues and usually JTV is the first thing that has to go.
Sorry.
Do you really want to watch people just talking?
I guess people like Justin TV because there's not as much lag and that they can hear the things that go on during the break time and that I guess the sound's better but I don't believe that.
The sound's crystal clear on all games so I don't get that.
Well my network just came back up so...
Yeah, so just kill Justin TV for the night.
Sorry, guys.
Alrighty.
Now it's fun naked time, so ha-ha, you miss out, Justin TV.
Anyways.
I'm taking my pants off right now.
We're going wild.
Guitar Hero On Tour Surprise is getting a sequel called On Tour Decades and I guess the first game sold just over a third of a million with 350,000 units sold in three weeks and the sequel no word on exactly when it's coming out there is rumors though that there might be some form of microphone functionality maybe karaoke um
I don't know.
No word though when it's coming out.
Big surprise!
A sequel for Guitar Hero game.
I mean, hey, they wouldn't want to leave the DS out with 50 billion releases each year.
Oh no, never.
Never.
Baby's Party
It's basically Imagine Babies, the party game.
It's coming out this autumn, and apparently you actually use the balance board in the game.
You actually play this at a babysitting academy, and there's 30 mini-games in the game.
It's head-to-head, co-op mode.
Both methods are available, and it's based on the typical day of a baby.
What, eat, sleep, poop, cry?
What?
Baby fart?
Grow up?
They can burp, they just need help
Um, what was the game they used to have at Milpitas Golf Land with the big buttons that was like the babies racing?
Oh, they had that at, um, at the game, at the game, the convention too.
It was... The hell was that?
Bye Bye Baby, no.
Bye Baby something?
Yeah, it was some like baby racing game.
Come on Baby, says AJ Mix.
Come on Baby, yeah.
There you go.
I can't wait for the breastfeeding minigame.
Me neither.
Anyhow, we've got a caller on Skype.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, this is GS68.
Hi, GS68.
How are you?
All right.
Hey, you got to go to California Extreme and you met Jamie live and in person, right?
Yep.
Now, I've asked you this because I've always wondered this myself.
What's Jamie like in real life off the air?
Last time I...
I kind of didn't recognize her at first, because last time I saw her was at Final Mate, and she had, I think, magenta-ish hair.
I don't remember.
Yeah, my hair was black in front and red in back.
But this time my hair was all black.
Also, Jamie, when you're speaking in person, you sound a little younger than you do right now on the air.
Okay.
I think the radio makes our voices bassier.
Well, didn't Travis say I used to sound like a hyperactive 13-year-old?
Yes, but then you went through puberty.
That was many years ago.
Alright, look.
In all seriousness, how was California Stream?
It was pretty cool.
Alright, then.
What games did you enjoy playing?
Were there some classic games you'd not really paid respect to before that caught your eyes?
Most of the games I played were games that I already played and I was familiar with or I hadn't played in a while like the old Star Wars arcade game or Tron.
I've played some games that I hadn't really played before like Tailgater and Looping.
Rob, build a meme.
Ugh.
But I want a real one.
It's real.
You can touch it.
Alright, alright.
We'll see, we'll see.
If you set it on fire, it'll burn.
We'll see.
I don't think my roommate would like that idea very much.
I know my wife didn't.
Yeah, except I'm not married to the roommate.
It's more of a business arrangement.
It's a little different.
Anyhow, I'm sorry.
I like to think of my marriage that way, too.
Originally, that's all marriage was, was a business agreement.
Look, GS68, is there anything we're getting on tangent?
Is there anything else you want to add about your wonderful weekend?
Yeah, but mostly I was playing The Grid, which is like this third-person shooter.
I know The Grid.
The Grid is awesome.
Yeah, and Rush 2049, which was the racing game of Horde before one-gun Maxi.
Did they ever bring The Grid out on home consoles?
I think it's on regular PlayStation, isn't it?
No, I don't think it is.
Wow, that's kind of weird.
Interesting.
Alright, well, GS68, any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we take another call?
Nintendo did not address restore space at E3.
Epic fucking fail.
Agreed.
I'm very disappointed they didn't address it.
I hold out hope that maybe since folks at Nintendo feel that this is not where they're going to be addressing the hardcore gamers anymore, my hopes are at PAX our questions will be answered because I can't think of what other show is for the hardcore gamers except maybe Tokyo Game Show.
Thank you for stealing my words.
Tokyo Game Show would be the other one.
They don't display at Tokyo Game Show though.
Normally Nintendo's not there.
Yeah, but they do something concurrent.
Yeah, they do that thing concurrently.
It's pretty much the same thing.
On all our end game facts, I have a statement that says I'm not removing it until Nintendo addresses Wii Store space.
I think it's very unfortunate they didn't.
I mean, that little speaker system is kind of whatever.
Just roll out a freaking patch that supports the SD cards.
Do it overnight while we're sleeping, you know?
Just do it.
Yeah, whatever happens.
PS2 did it.
The original Xbox did it.
Why can't...
A console that's one generation ahead.
Oh, but it's the new generation, not the next generation.
But you have to understand, they announced stuff that's been out on other systems forever and act like it's the newest thing ever.
Like, oh my god, it's voice chat over the internet.
This has never been done a billion times before.
Oh, but wait, it's different.
It's a community voice chat because it's a giant microphone thing instead of headsets.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Gold Banjo
I never got around to that.
That, well, you didn't miss much.
It'll come out until really late in the GameCube cycle.
Star Fox will be the thing that we get a couple years down the road.
But F-Zero, man.
Maybe it's just because Mario Kart is still out there, so they want Mario Kart to be the racing thing for a little while.
But I really hope that next year's E3 we get something about F-Zero.
Yeah, me too.
We'll see.
But I'm just a big F-Zero fan.
What can I say?
I wouldn't mind watching somebody else kind of pick that up.
You know, Wipeout's kind of cool.
I guess Wipeout's the closest thing I can think of on another system that's kind of like F-Zero, but it's not the same.
But I love that futuristic fast racing.
That's my favorite, is the future fast.
Speed Racer.
Really?
I'm going to have to check that out.
You should check it out.
It's actually pretty cool.
Do you own it?
Yes.
I'm going to borrow it.
You can't borrow it.
Thanks for watching!
I got my... But with the first online journey onto the online thing, there's always going to be that... The little kid that likes to swear and be rude.
Yeah, it happens.
The kid's like speaking some other language and stuff, and then once we start to try and vote ban him, then he apologizes and speaks English.
So I'm like, you know, now you can speak English.
and it just got me so mad and stuff and then he's like swearing not to ban him.
We just banned him.
No questions asked.
Good for you.
I have a zero tolerance policy for idiots on those things and on Xbox Live I warn them every time.
I do the little feedback thing every time.
I'm a little jerk on Xbox Live.
I'm a tattletale.
But you know what?
Somebody's got to do it.
Exactly.
It's just annoying.
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Go Banjo.
Let me think.
I don't know.
E3 could have been better, but I am excited for Banjo-Kazooie 3.
I don't care what anybody else says.
I'm a hardcore Banjo-Kazooie fan.
We haven't had a lot of Banjo-Kazooie love on the show tonight, so there you have it.
Gold Banjo adding a little bit of Banjo Kazooie love so it's not just a clever name Banjo Kazooie alright have a good night my friend take care I was going to say too real quick if you are interested in a game that's sort of like you know F-Zero try the Speed Racer Wii game it just dropped in price it's only $29.99 now and you probably can get it used for even cheaper I still need to play the pinball game I got on Wii I've played a little bit of it and it's fun I need to play more of it because pinball is awesome right Jamie?
Yes, it is.
Or if you don't own a Wii, you can get it on the PS2 coming in September.
Aw, Shaoran in chat called me a fucking narc.
But narc was an awesome game, so shut up.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch.
Winners don't use drugs, Rob.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Bow down to Pyramid Head.
No, this is Osfer.
Hey, what's up, Osfer?
That would be cool if Pyramid Head did call us.
I feel like I'm the only one that was kind of excited for a new Zelda game to be announced, and it was never announced, so I'm sad.
It was Phantom Hourglass.
It was
I don't know.
It was okay.
You have to remember, Nintendo's developing for two major platforms now.
It's not just about the Wii, it's about the DS as well.
So, you know, they're a little split there.
But I think you'll see a new Zelda, you know, Uber-type looking game next year, probably.
I was more surprised that Kid Icarus thing, with all the evidence that supported its existence, I'm very surprised that didn't show up.
Very surprised.
Well, you know that there's just
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Donkey Kong Barrel Blast
Of course, the Wii Zapper and Super Mario Galaxy.
I don't think there was anything for December, January or something.
But they have room to announce some more games in there.
And I don't think they're going to have one game for the holiday.
Unless they manage to get the Wii Sports Resort thing out.
So I expect some more announcements.
So some hopefulness from Loki that makes sense.
Makes sense to me.
He's right.
There's got to be more than one game coming out this Christmas.
Any other thoughts, Ossifer?
I'm kind of concerned about the future for DDR, seeing as that they want to add mines or shock arrows, as they call it, into it.
Eh, at least they're trying something new for them, but you're right, I don't think it's going to give the game the swift kick in the pants it needs, but it's something, I guess, to hold people over.
Well, I don't want DDR to turn into ITG, because that's one of the main reasons I hate in the group,
Yeah, and also, even if you can turn it off, like in the group, it kicks you from being able to rank in any of the songs, so, I don't know.
Interesting.
Well, we'll see.
I am curious about that new machine, though, when everyone comes to our neighborhood.
Hopefully it doesn't get broken by little kids first.
We'll see.
I forgot to mention, I played Guitar Freak's V4 this week.
I have to say I'm very unimpressed by it.
It's just, I don't know, the whole interface and everything looks like a really shoddy PlayStation 2 game.
which actually I think the releases of Guitar Freaks are on Playstation 2 so I guess it makes sense but no innovation whatsoever alright well we gotta let you go buddy we're gonna wrap up the show but have a good one okay alright see ya I'm calling to the night later
Alright, we're going to close the Skype line for now.
If you didn't get through, I'm so sorry, but you can always leave us a voicemail, or, and I've got to catch up on voicemails, probably next week we'll do that, or you can always send us an email, mailbag, orange launch radio dot com.
Let's do some last minute stories.
Jamie, you said you had a couple.
I actually do, and one of them, because I couldn't get the email pulled back up, I found it from another site, but this one was given to me by Rob with two Bs.
Time Hollow, which is a Konami game for the DS, is to be localized and released in August.
It's actually, the neat thing about the game is that you get this thing called a time pen, which is your stylus, that you use to manipulate time to solve puzzles within the game.
It's very, almost sort of Phoenix Wright-ish.
and in terms of how it feels or how it plays but you can check either the Japanese website for it which is konami.jp slash time underscore hollow or I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube.
and the other thing that's I know a few other anime fans would be excited about this is that Sega grabbed the license for the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya for Nintendo DS actually several of the DS games from Namco Bandai and Sega's like okay we want so you might see those eventually and you can also get the little happy dance that she does oh the Playstation 2 one
in the Playstation 2 when she apparently makes her own RPG and then you get to play it.
Cool.
Very cool.
Loki, anything?
Of course I have stuff.
I have a long laundry list of stuff.
Make it quick.
We want to go home.
Um, anyways, Ubisoft announced a game called I Am Alive, it's like a survival game, looks pretty cool, coming out Spring 2009, and, uh, yeah, I had an awesome trailer for that.
Rock Band 2, they announced the full track list for the game, which is pretty awesome, including, uh, there's ACDC, AFI, Lance Morissette, um, Alice in Chains, Bad Company, Beastie Boys, Billy Idol, um...
There is Journey.
Pretty much one of those rumored lists came true.
Yes, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, etc.
Fleetwood Mac, awesome.
But there is 84 songs that they detailed.
And I hear there's going to be 20 more tracks as well, but they're going to be free downloads.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
The Rockman instruments will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour.
So you will actually be able to use them.
What they're going to do, since Guitar Hero World Tour has five things you can hit instead of...
XBOX 360 Guitar Hero Aerosmith
Um, apparently NCAA Football 09 is really broken.
They have a laundry list of stuff that's just not working, including some sliders, like the CPU sliders don't do anything, the online Dynasty mode's broken, the Super Sim mode is broken, and kick returns are also broken, and some other crap.
So, way to go, EA Sports.
Also, I want to see NASCAR 09.
The game saves are broken.
Sweet.
One thing that's kind of interesting is apparently Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had...
What?
Nice.
Interesting.
Um...
Also, the NPD results for June have come out, and the Wii is now the number one selling system in the US, as well as the world now.
So, 10.9 million units with the Xbox 360 trailing behind by just a little bit.
So, very interesting.
Thank you for watching!
There's also rumors that Nintendo might actually be publishing that title.
Sonic and Mario World.
That would be awesome.
That would be kind of interesting there.
Miyamoto announced that they're making a Pikmin game.
Rhythm Heaven Rhythm Tengoku Gold
Samba de Amigo, Sega has confirmed that it will be getting download content.
It's actually going to debut some launch content starting on September 23rd when the game is launched.
The first set of downloads will include the 80s radio song I Want Candy from Bow Wow Wow.
Or Bow Wow Wow.
Wow, wow.
Yeah, we get it.
Too many.
Jets, Are You Going to Be My Girl?
and Lou Bega's Mambo Mambo.
And no word if those are pay-to-unlock content or if it's actually download content, but interesting nonetheless.
And let's see here.
There was a new unlock code for Supernova 2 cabinets that revealed three more songs.
Terra Stars, Jet Girl Spins, Mars Wars 3, and Revenge G Alternative with Reba.
Rebata, or however you pronounce that.
And then, of course, Paranoid Hades.
So that's kind of cool.
And let's see here.
Real quick...
That's a lot of last minute stories.
Sorry, sorry.
I'm trying to be quick.
GPS coming to the PSP within nine months.
They're releasing some Famicom inspired classic controllers, so you can import those if you want them.
Um...
Let's see here... Well, it was E3 week, so it was a little busy this week.
Fun little bit of trivia.
Animal Crossing, which was being shown off at E3, actually had, of course, none other than Charles Martinet playing the game as well from an undisclosed location with a Mario-style avatar.
And he was riffing people in the Mario voice and was also hitting people with axes and complaining about people that ran over his flowers.
I'm thinking undisclosed location means backstage, because...
I don't know if you remember when they showed off the whole voice chat or the DS internet thing, but they had Charles Martinet in Seattle, right?
Remember that?
And then you would see him like an hour later walking around the show floor.
Yeah, because he could teleport.
There is a rumor that someone is working on a PSP emulator for the Wii and they have screenshots.
Unfortunately, right now it's only running at about 7 frames per second, but that's still disturbing nonetheless.
Animal Crossing will support USB keyboards so you can actually type your messages to people without having to use the Wii remote because that sucked.
Gears of War 2 is coming out November 7th this year so people are probably excited about that.
LittleBigPlanet is going to allow you to charge users for your content that you created.
Oh god.
DKS3713 Final Fantasy VII
Rock Band 2 is going to be... The release of this is really strange.
The game-only version for the Xbox 360 is coming out in September.
The bundle, as long as with the PS3 bundle, the PS3 standalone version is coming out in October.
And then the Wii...
and PlayStation 2 versions I think are coming out in November.
Is that confusing enough?
And then let's see here.
And then my favorite thing, which I'm going to end on here real quick, is that there's a quote taken from G4, apparently it was an interview with Reggie Fils-Aimé, who says, How could you feel left out?
The Animal Crossing that we've been hearing about that people wanted...
Fully connected to the internet, go to other people's towns, plus I said Grand Theft Auto on the DS, how do you feel left out with those types of announcements?
Well, it's quite easy.
Because there's about 500 other things you didn't address, but maybe it's just me.
I'm not a casual gamer, what do I know?
Alright, thank you for the follow-up updates.
Although quite lengthy, it was E3 week.
There's a lot of shit going on.
Next week, I'm sure we'll have a lot of stuff too as the fallout begins from E3 and we start ramping up towards Christmas, as was said earlier.
But for now, we go around and we get everybody's final thought.
Loki, your final thought tonight.
My final thought is, this is actually kind of funny, there's apparently Dead Rising, the Wii version is being called Dead Rising Zombie Sacrifice in Japan, and I don't know if this is true, but for the US version, I heard that they're calling it Dead Rising Chop Until You Drop.
Cheesy.
I like that.
My final thought is, I kind of want a burrito.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Uh...
Uh-oh, we might have to chop till we drop DarkSakura.
She sounds like she's turning into a zombie.
that is a distinct possibility alright, until then thank you guys so much for downloading thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and supporting Orange Launcher, do remember if you like what you hear oh sorry, god damn it sorry, I am ending the damn show this is important this is important, real quick DDRX, they're reviving some of their old licensed songs including Dub by Dub and Butterfly I may have mentioned that last week but I don't remember either way, Dubby Dub's coming back
Do not want.
That might make a headache worse, won't it?
I've got a very bad headache right now.
I sorry.
All right.
Well, remember, if you like what you hear, we persevere through the headaches and through the fire and the flames to bring you this program each and every week.
Please tell two friends you know about the program.
That's how we spread around the world slowly.
Hey, we'll see you at PAX in a few weeks, those of you that are going.
All three of us are going to be there, and I can't wait to meet you guys.
I don't know if there will be an OLR meetup one night, but I imagine we'll do something.
It's going to be a party.
It's going to be so much fun.
Right, Loki?
It's so much fun?
I don't know.
I've never been to PAX.
Until then, we'll see you guys next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys.
We'll see you next time.
See you next week!
