1
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:15,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Night, July 20th, 2008.

2
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:25,616
[SPEAKER_04]: At E3, Microsoft announces a Netflix partnership, Sony is set to launch a new MAG game, and Nintendo announces a Grand Theft Audible portable game.

3
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:35,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:41,308
[SPEAKER_09]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

5
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:44,069
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not cool enough for E3, I'm sorry to say.

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,451
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we just sat here bitter all week long eating our bonbons and watching it on TV.

7
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:49,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, DarkSakura?

8
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:50,792
[SPEAKER_09]: My lovely co-host?

9
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:51,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell no.

10
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:52,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I did other stuff.

11
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:53,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what?

12
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:54,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Going outside?

13
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:54,634
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

14
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Classic Gaming Expo.

15
00:00:58,136 --> 00:00:58,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Classic Gaming Expo.

16
00:00:58,936 --> 00:00:59,576
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell am I saying?

17
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:01,077
[SPEAKER_01]: California Extreme.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,051
[SPEAKER_09]: TechMasterLoki

19
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:20,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing okay.

20
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:21,764
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

21
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:23,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you did not go to California Extreme.

22
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,225
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I did not go to California Extreme.

23
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:27,026
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do in lieu of E3 this year?

24
00:01:27,306 --> 00:01:31,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually watched E3, watched the press conferences streaming.

25
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:34,609
[SPEAKER_08]: During work, I might add, because it technically is work-related.

26
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:37,591
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you sell the games, so it's kind of work-related for you.

27
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:40,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I tried getting that past management.

28
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily, management wasn't there, so we watched it anyways.

29
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:43,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

30
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:45,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it was interesting.

31
00:01:46,939 --> 00:02:08,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I ended up reading it through blogs because my day job I teach, not kids but adults, I teach in a corporate environment and so I didn't really have a chance to watch anything live so I just had to kind of read it through blogs but you know people had it covered I guess although it would have been more exciting to be there but you know what can you do

32
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:18,816
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go to a different expo, that's what you can do And we'll talk more about that in a little while But first, let's hear about the trip that Jamie took this week Which I'm surprised somebody would do a gaming expo the same week as E3 But you went on a little trip, right?

33
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:23,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I went all day for Saturday.

34
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,871
[SPEAKER_01]: It ended today.

35
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:30,514
[SPEAKER_01]: But I ran into lots of people that I know, including someone in our chat room right now, GS68.

36
00:02:31,874 --> 00:02:32,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

37
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Who actually found me.

38
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:35,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice hat, by the way.

39
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran into Mella Melody.

40
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:41,358
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into Wendell and some of his buddies.

41
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:45,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And saw a few other notable personages.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually saw Jason Enos in line.

43
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:58,081
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 has actually posted his share of pictures from the event on his little photo bucket in our chat room, chat.orangelonsradio.com.

44
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's this I see here?

45
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:00,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this might be a picture.

46
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:04,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes, there is DarkSakura, our very own little space invader.

47
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:05,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

48
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Melody and I wanted to steal it.

49
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,673
[SPEAKER_09]: And some other lady with her ass on the table right next to you.

50
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I look like hell Like hell

51
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:36,888
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

52
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,022
[SPEAKER_01]: and a few more recent ones.

53
00:03:58,342 --> 00:04:00,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, there's a spider again!

54
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I got an email with a Journey arcade game picture, so I know you played that at least.

55
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:07,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play it.

56
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:07,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Melody did.

57
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,047
[SPEAKER_01]: It made part of my soul hurt.

58
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:12,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

59
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:15,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I cried from nostalgia.

60
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Did she get the... She finally got the concert toward the end of the day.

61
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say, you have to get the tape to play.

62
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:24,632
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the best part.

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so, games.

64
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:30,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a list of stuff I did and did not play.

65
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:36,508
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, they had a demo of a Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remake set up.

66
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:48,657
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a PlayStation 3 set up with the online games, including Puzzle Fighter HD, which I watched Wendell and Mel play.

67
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:56,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Melody and I played Ride and Fighters 2, which was pretty fucking sweet, and I got 5th highest score.

68
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,782
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the Prop Cycle Addams Family there.

69
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:00,802
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

70
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:04,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the people that have the Prop Cycle set up to play Addams Family?

71
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:06,024
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't seen that.

72
00:05:06,044 --> 00:05:08,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have too, because we commented on it.

73
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:08,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

74
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the Prop Cycle, but I've never seen it.

75
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:11,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see.

76
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that is kind of strange.

77
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:27,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Is actually someone on a prop cycle attached to an Addams Family and the game runs as you pedal.

78
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:28,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

79
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:30,468
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had pictures of this set before.

80
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on.

81
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,692
[SPEAKER_01]: My phone's upside down, Rob.

82
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:37,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Star Wars Racer Arcade

83
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,563
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it was like a submarine or space game before or something, but it was kind of neat.

84
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,346
[SPEAKER_01]: They had Blasteroids there, which I didn't play.

85
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:03,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was so mad because I took a picture of a guy in a Big Bang Bar shirt, but the picture didn't come out well.

86
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,655
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had one of those mini SNK cabinets.

87
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:08,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's, if you can see...

88
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:13,302
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to play on our knees to play it.

89
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we played Puzzle Bobble.

90
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:20,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And Melody and I played a sit-down of Crystal Castles, the two-player sit-downs.

91
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:21,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, cool.

92
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:23,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of the cocktail, yeah.

93
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:24,860
[SPEAKER_09]: You set your drink on it.

94
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:28,483
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I didn't... Oh yeah, this is a picture of some dude playing Journey.

95
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,685
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it just Arcade Game Madness or what?

96
00:06:32,705 --> 00:06:34,945
[SPEAKER_09]: They have these little panels and stuff there too, right?

97
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:35,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, panels.

98
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:45,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan went to the panel that had Steve Ritchie, who's the guy who designed some of the best pins ever, like Twilight Zone and No Fear.

99
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,070
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have a lot of the games that he designed.

100
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,531
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, they did have Tapper, but I didn't play.

101
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

102
00:06:50,971 --> 00:06:53,212
[SPEAKER_01]: But they...

103
00:06:55,311 --> 00:07:00,755
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to that panel, and then I went to a panel later on with Dan to see someone talk about customizing.

104
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:05,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to be understanding because it was his first panel, it just wasn't very well presented.

105
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, with a little bit of experience he can do better, but there were some interesting things.

106
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,424
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went to a panel about the guy who made Donkey Kong 2.

107
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:22,979
[SPEAKER_01]: As in, he sprite-ripped and redid levels to have going after the original four in Donkey Kong.

108
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:27,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was going to say, wait, Donkey Kong 2 is Donkey Kong Jr., but this is a different thing.

109
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,722
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an actual Donkey Kong 2.

110
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:29,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

111
00:07:30,243 --> 00:07:33,805
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find the... He actually has a website and everything.

112
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:38,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to watch Tilt, but I only watched the first part of it because I've seen the rest of it.

113
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:44,250
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like about the end of William's pinball division in the Pinball 2000 that came out.

114
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,671
[SPEAKER_01]: It did play some episode one.

115
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:48,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And I played a sit-down Sinistar.

116
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Beware, I live

117
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:30,703
[SPEAKER_01]: and then, oh, there's my beer.

118
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:42,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played an eight ball deluxe, which is the, I think as far, if I'm right, is the second highest grossing flipper using pinball table.

119
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The first being Addams Family.

120
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,983
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I played the Ted Nugent pinball, which was actually really good.

121
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:49,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know that existed.

122
00:08:49,683 --> 00:08:52,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Galaga 98, Pacmania, Monopoly, Pango.

123
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:54,404
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a Pango in a really good condition.

124
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:55,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Pango.

125
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,724
[SPEAKER_01]: A really good, pretty Tron.

126
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,145
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people were there?

127
00:08:59,565 --> 00:08:59,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons.

128
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:02,445
[SPEAKER_01]: There were just a lot of people.

129
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:07,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I honestly don't know that the turnout this year was as good as last.

130
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,186
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have the auction.

131
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:11,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think it might have to do with the fact they're holding at the same time as E3 too?

132
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that was really their choice.

133
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:18,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Because from what I understand, they were trying to avoid scheduling around the Jazz Festival in San Jose.

134
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:20,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this one's a cool one.

135
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,769
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can see, it's a black Spider-Man pinball machine.

136
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,851
[SPEAKER_01]: They only made, I think, 500 of them.

137
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:27,592
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone brought it in.

138
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:30,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you hit the right flipper button, you can play it in Spanish.

139
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:42,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this guy here who had a Flynn's t-shirt on, which if anyone is a big Tron nut like me, you know that that's the name of the arcade that the guy had.

140
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:43,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this was really cool.

141
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:57,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone took the wizard pinball table, which was the one that Elton John was playing in Tommy, and made the big boots and put it up on a stand to play on like in Tommy's.

142
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:06,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I have to address this, because Bobby's saying this in our chatroom, chat.orangelearnsradio.com, and our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us on allgames.com, he says, It wasn't the same time as E3.

143
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,451
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 ended Thursday.

144
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,532
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything, it made it easier for someone to attend it.

145
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:11,113
[SPEAKER_09]: They could just hop up after E3.

146
00:10:11,473 --> 00:10:14,154
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm thinking, like, okay, I've been to E3 in the past.

147
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, it was a lot different back then.

148
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I know how I felt at the end of E3.

149
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:19,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to do shit.

150
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,858
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea of another gaming expo was, like, the furthest thing from my mind.

151
00:10:23,718 --> 00:10:27,725
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody had told me, hey, let's go to a gaming expo tomorrow, I would be like, you've got to be kidding me.

152
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:29,809
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

153
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too close together.

154
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,539
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta give it at least a month.

155
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been really tight.

156
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:48,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say the one day of me going, well, granted, I didn't have the medication that I have to take, but I got so tired just walking around.

157
00:10:50,444 --> 00:11:00,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we left the house at 10, and we got there just a little bit after noon, actually closer to 1, so Dan could hit that panel he wanted to go to.

158
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,894
[SPEAKER_01]: But just walking around all day.

159
00:11:05,546 --> 00:11:06,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Just all day walking.

160
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:10,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pretty much dead tired.

161
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I did nothing but sleep today.

162
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,970
[SPEAKER_09]: You better prepare yourself for PAX.

163
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,011
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be three days.

164
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bring better shoes.

165
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:16,892
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

166
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:18,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God, shoes.

167
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:19,473
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

168
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:20,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, shoes.

169
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:22,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the lovely report.

170
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:24,536
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll hear more from Dan later, possibly.

171
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:25,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.

172
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:26,797
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

173
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:27,878
[SPEAKER_01]: But go to our forum.

174
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:35,912
[SPEAKER_01]: In our Orange Lounge chat area, I did post up the review that Dan wrote for us.

175
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:40,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we have nowhere on the front page to do it... Yet.

176
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:40,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet.

177
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:42,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

178
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:45,218
[SPEAKER_01]: But Dan wrote a lengthy review.

179
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:50,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your gaming week while you weren't attending any cool expos?

180
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:51,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the cool kids.

181
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:53,163
[SPEAKER_08]: It was okay.

182
00:11:53,763 --> 00:11:53,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Like...

183
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:56,562
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

184
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:14,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Tales of Vesperia.

185
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:15,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't like it.

186
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,565
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wanted to like it.

187
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I already had it pre-ordered.

188
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:23,989
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like a game I could probably get into, kind of like Eternal Sonata or something like that.

189
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,652
[SPEAKER_08]: What did it for me is I thought it was a little cheesy.

190
00:12:31,373 --> 00:12:32,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the graphics are awesome.

191
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,815
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics are just like Eternal Sonata, I noticed.

192
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,496
[SPEAKER_08]: The combat was kind of annoying.

193
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:38,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't like the combat.

194
00:12:38,276 --> 00:12:39,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the same voice actors, too.

195
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I didn't like the combat one bit.

196
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,178
[SPEAKER_08]: That kind of ruined it for me.

197
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:51,701
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all kind of real-time, and you switch between your characters, and you cast spells and stuff, and everyone kind of is on autopilot, which kind of sucked.

198
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:59,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked Eternal Sonata a lot better, where it was turn-based, and you could do all that real-time stuff within a certain time limit.

199
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was pretty cool, but this was kind of all over the place.

200
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:04,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

201
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:09,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Then my buddy played Too Human.

202
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:12,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get a chance to play it because I tried downloading the demo twice.

203
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Both times it was corrupted, so that was awesome.

204
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:19,035
[SPEAKER_08]: And here it was just mediocre, so I don't know.

205
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:22,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's going to buy it because he liked games like Conan and stuff like that.

206
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:24,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, you know, I kind of like that too.

207
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,880
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't really take much to impress me as far as action games go.

208
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know.

209
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:30,702
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

210
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play some DS games.

211
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I played Metal Slug 7 a bit.

212
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:40,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't really play the main game of it, because, I mean, shit, it's just Metal Slug.

213
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,073
[SPEAKER_08]: But they had these, like, challenge mode things in there, and that was kind of interesting.

214
00:13:44,113 --> 00:13:48,497
[SPEAKER_08]: You had different tasks, and once you finish those, you go up in rank and stuff like that.

215
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:49,478
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets harder.

216
00:13:49,558 --> 00:13:52,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool with the added replayability.

217
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:54,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I played...

218
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:56,464
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

219
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:18,426
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

220
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,561
[SPEAKER_08]: And... What else did I play?

221
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was pretty much it.

222
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:42,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just kind of going all over the place.

223
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:45,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I went back to play some old Xbox Live Arcade games.

224
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Played Zuma some more.

225
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:48,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's fun.

226
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:52,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Because now that I have it hooked up to the TV again, Nelly's like, Oh, Zuma, I can play this again.

227
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:53,585
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

228
00:14:54,784 --> 00:15:00,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, sounds like you were keeping yourself busy with what you already have, games you already have to beat.

229
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:07,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, and I was just looking at, there was stuff that came out this week, Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but all of it sucked.

230
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:09,853
[SPEAKER_09]: and, uh, ooh, Tuesday.

231
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:10,795
[SPEAKER_09]: This Tuesday.

232
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,400
[SPEAKER_09]: My DS, I gotta dust it off with what's coming out this Tuesday.

233
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:17,783
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll tell you later in the show when we get to release dates.

234
00:15:18,143 --> 00:15:21,848
[SPEAKER_09]: However, uh, my gaming week, I'll keep it short, um, because there really wasn't a lot to it.

235
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,429
[SPEAKER_09]: I played most of the same stuff I've been playing.

236
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Civ Rev, uh, Space Invaders Dream on PSP, but I had a little bit of Renaissance as well.

237
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:28,776
[SPEAKER_09]: I, uh,

238
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,476
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:55,684
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the point of this game?

240
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:58,946
[SPEAKER_09]: He's kind of like, why do you like this game?

241
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,187
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like there's no point.

242
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,088
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, you're kind of right.

243
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:03,189
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no point.

244
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:04,270
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the point.

245
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,470
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like The Sims.

246
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:07,412
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no real point to that either.

247
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:12,395
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought I would play it to try and collect more of the NES games.

248
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Because remember that was one awesome thing about Animal Crossing on the GameCube is that it had all the old school NES games buried in it.

249
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you could get like Clue Clue Land.

250
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,761
[SPEAKER_09]: How awesome is that?

251
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:22,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And Donkey Kong Jr.

252
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:22,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Math.

253
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,220
[SPEAKER_09]: GameCubeVersion.com

254
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:49,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's already outputting pretty much the same level that other Wii games would.

255
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:56,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, the slightly more advanced Wii hardware would probably make a better F-Zero game, but I want to see something like F-Zero on like 720, 1080 level.

256
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,024
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

257
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:00,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that like F-Zero?

258
00:17:00,345 --> 00:17:01,307
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a fun racing game.

259
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:06,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was a little sad they didn't announce that, a new F-Zero game at their press conference.

260
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:07,149
[SPEAKER_08]: But what can you do?

261
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:13,172
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to understand, the E3 wasn't for the core gamer, for at least Nintendo.

262
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:18,675
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the stuff they announced was casual stuff.

263
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:25,419
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru in chat, chat.northstar.com, does correct me and says Donkey Kong Junior Math is on the virtual console, but it's not worth $5.

264
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct, it's not worth $5 considering you can get an Animal Crossing for free.

265
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:31,922
[SPEAKER_09]: There you have it.

266
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:38,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping.

267
00:17:38,926 --> 00:17:43,628
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, as we announced at our own E3 press conference last week, you will get one big show.

268
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:47,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully everything on the technical end works, but you will get one big show.

269
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,073
[SPEAKER_09]: There will no longer be part A and B, so the podcast feed might look a little different because of that, but that'll be pretty cool.

270
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,194
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's it.

271
00:17:55,274 --> 00:18:00,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, continue to support us by giving us positive reviews on iTunes.

272
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:01,496
[SPEAKER_09]: We always appreciate that.

273
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:05,537
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been a few new ones that have popped up lately, some very nice five-star reviews.

274
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:11,339
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, right now, if I checked correctly, we have exactly 69 reviews on iTunes right now, which is a great number to be at.

275
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much.

276
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:15,120
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like some more, as nice as a 69 number is.

277
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,021
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't forget that.

278
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Our LiveJournal community.

279
00:18:19,086 --> 00:18:21,887
[SPEAKER_09]: We are at Community Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.

280
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:22,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So look us up there.

281
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:26,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Facebook OL Army on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.

282
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:31,611
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are your social networking BFFs on any of those sites you want to be our buds on.

283
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:32,272
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

284
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:33,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into some gaming news.

285
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:37,014
[SPEAKER_09]: This week a little different because we had E3 happen this week.

286
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:40,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing but press conference stuff in this half of the show.

287
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:43,977
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about kind of the big three press conferences and our thoughts on it since –

288
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,719
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XIII would be coming to the Xbox 360 day and date in the U.S.,

289
00:19:04,031 --> 00:19:04,972
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

290
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:34,674
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not going to be coming, it's not exclusive in, or not coming to the Xbox 360 in Japan though.

291
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:35,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

292
00:19:35,835 --> 00:19:38,858
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the US, it will be coming out day and date.

293
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:43,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Which really kind of shows that this whole move is motivated nothing by but sales.

294
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically that they feel they have a better chance of penetrating the marketplace.

295
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so, yeah.

296
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

297
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:53,470
[SPEAKER_09]: But my curiosity is, how long is it going to make this game be out?

298
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, how far do we have to wait for this game?

299
00:19:56,471 --> 00:20:00,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they admitted they haven't even really started developing this game for the 360.

300
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:04,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they've been doing it on some type of PC design, like, what do they call it, Crystal or something?

301
00:20:05,015 --> 00:20:07,056
[SPEAKER_09]: They do it on, you know, it's probably their own design platform.

302
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:08,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I think here's the thing.

303
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:11,538
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really going to be an issue with storage.

304
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:13,338
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to be a problem getting it.

305
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it's not going to be on one disc, but that's fine.

306
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:23,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's actually not going to hold them up too much because it's a lot easier to develop for the 360 than it is for the PS3.

307
00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:31,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that Square Enix has a lot more experience developing for the 360 right now rather than the PS3.

308
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:35,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's really going to hold it up any more than localizing it would.

309
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:54,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Mace Hatsuma in chat asked the question that I've been actually getting asked a lot this week because I've been pretty open on this show that I had no plans to get a Playstation 3 until Final Fantasy XIII came out so now this is a question I've been getting a lot this week as I'm sure a lot of people like me have Mace Hatsuma says will you buy a PS3 now?

310
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:57,144
[SPEAKER_09]: You always said you'll buy a PS3 when Final Fantasy XIII comes out

311
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,515
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

312
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:23,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

313
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,330
[SPEAKER_09]: is Sony likely to come down in price on those systems later?

314
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll hear more about that later, I'm sure.

315
00:21:43,473 --> 00:21:53,321
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing I think also, too, you have to look at is from the publisher's standpoint, when they put this game out, and it's not even necessarily this game, because I'm thinking Last Remnant is going to be out way before this.

316
00:21:54,382 --> 00:21:57,485
[SPEAKER_08]: When that comes out, they're going to look at the sales of that

317
00:21:57,985 --> 00:21:59,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Game on both consoles.

318
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:05,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's anything like Grand Theft Auto 4 was, it's going to be a lot more on the 360 than it is on the PS3.

319
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that may not be the case.

320
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:07,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, it's not going to be the case in Japan.

321
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:13,649
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have to look at each market separately and kind of base their decisions on that.

322
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:19,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if they were just to base it all on the Japanese market, then we wouldn't be getting anything on the 360.

323
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:21,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I got two questions.

324
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:26,395
[SPEAKER_09]: First is for Jamie because I haven't heard anything yet and I know you like Final Fantasy like the rest of us.

325
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,476
[SPEAKER_09]: What was your reaction to the news?

326
00:22:29,102 --> 00:22:31,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I really didn't care.

327
00:22:32,366 --> 00:22:33,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I have both systems.

328
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:37,551
[SPEAKER_09]: That leads into my next question, that you and Loki own both systems.

329
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:52,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Knowing that Final Fantasy XIII, I guess you could say for all practical purposes, was being designed for the PlayStation 3, now it's coming out for the 360, do you think you're more inclined to get it on PlayStation 3, or what system do you think you might ultimately get this game on?

330
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,727
[SPEAKER_09]: or have you even decided yet?

331
00:22:53,747 --> 00:23:04,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably PS3 because if that's what it was designed for then that's what it was designed for but it doesn't mean that later on I won't pick it up dirt cheap for Xbox 360.

332
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:06,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, depends on features.

333
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:07,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

334
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:07,961
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

335
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:33,657
[SPEAKER_09]: What if they come out and say, you know what, the 360 version did have to take a little hit in quality?

336
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:35,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

337
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:42,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if I were you, if I heard one iota of the 360 is going to have to sacrifice something, I'd pick it up on PS3.

338
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,223
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit about achievements.

339
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:47,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Name one game out there that runs better on the PS3 than the 360.

340
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:50,386
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't one.

341
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:51,807
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always the other way around.

342
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony fanboys and chat.orange.com, please.

343
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:59,109
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear Oblivion's a little bit graphically better, but I don't know.

344
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but we're talking marginally.

345
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:11,053
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't going to be breaking any sort of... There's no discernible difference in between the two.

346
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:17,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at all the games that come out now, and they do that stupid comparison between the 360 and PS3 versions.

347
00:24:19,284 --> 00:24:22,228
[SPEAKER_08]: There's minimal differences.

348
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:30,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're talking when the PS3 version comes out and there's lag issues, frame rate issues, freezing issues, and stuff like that.

349
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:32,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

350
00:24:33,042 --> 00:24:35,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not worth...

351
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Picking up on the PS3 for.

352
00:24:39,972 --> 00:24:44,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, not to say that, like I said, there's stuff on the PS3 I definitely want.

353
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Resistance Fallman 2.

354
00:24:45,997 --> 00:24:47,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yeah, I will be getting that on the PS3.

355
00:24:47,978 --> 00:24:51,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, a couple people, a couple comments in chat.

356
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Burnout Paradise is a game that's being mentioned.

357
00:24:54,524 --> 00:24:58,127
[SPEAKER_09]: And Joshi16 gives the lulz with Metal Gear Solid 4 plays better.

358
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but Burnout Paradise, okay, look at Burnout Paradise.

359
00:25:01,206 --> 00:25:03,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, hold on, let's let Jamie say it, because you wanted to say something a minute ago.

360
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:18,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, still, all of that actually means really nothing to me, because I had already decided to get it on, you know, I had kept it in my head open that if it came out on Xbox 360, I don't, first of all, it's not coming out in Japan on Xbox 360.

361
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,392
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to get the release.

362
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:27,176
[SPEAKER_01]: This means that I can actually interact with a larger community on the PlayStation 3 version, first of all.

363
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:31,578
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about achievements, and I really don't care about going online.

364
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:42,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be able to find more stuff, a larger community, especially for me who loves the fan side of it.

365
00:25:42,585 --> 00:25:48,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think that the controller scheme lends itself better to RPGs on the PlayStation than on Xbox.

366
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:50,531
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

367
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:07,088
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

368
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:28,669
[SPEAKER_01]: The other half of the fun for me is actually going on international sites and seeing what the world reaction is.

369
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:31,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I love looking at fan art.

370
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I love finding fan sites.

371
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:34,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's fun.

372
00:26:34,752 --> 00:26:37,114
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's fine, but that's not platform specific.

373
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,175
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to only have PS3 fans.

374
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:49,300
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't necessarily... That'd be like saying, for example, that you have fans for Eternal Sonata, but there's going to be fans for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 version.

375
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,321
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter...

376
00:26:51,141 --> 00:26:51,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

377
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:12,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let me let the chat have the last word here.

378
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Ossifer says, isn't Versus XIII still exclusive to the PS3 in the US?

379
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if it is, I'm sure that game will jump ship too.

380
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:24,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Sales will probably be a big question as to whether that happens or not, I'd imagine.

381
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Versus XIII I don't think has been announced for the US yet.

382
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:32,211
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still Japanese only, and if that's the case, then yeah, it probably still is PS3.

383
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:40,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they showed the trailer at E3 a couple years ago, so I'm thinking it's going to be... Yeah, but they also showed the trailer for Star Ocean like two years ago too, so...

384
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:45,481
[SPEAKER_09]: As Sephiroth1215 and Xenocore agree, say the D-pad on the 360 is what's horrible.

385
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:46,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree.

386
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,704
[SPEAKER_09]: That D-pad on 360 is awful.

387
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:52,508
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the problem with the controller right there, is that D-pad.

388
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:58,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't like to use the analog stick with a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games, and that D-pad sucks.

389
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially for the retro games and fighters.

390
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:01,957
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fighters.

391
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:02,818
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the thing.

392
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:05,500
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the PlayStation 3 controller, I think, is better, is fighters.

393
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:06,441
[SPEAKER_09]: But...

394
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:07,474
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

395
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:16,381
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wanted to take a clue from the best controller ever made, they should look at the Sega Saturn Dual Analog Controller for their model.

396
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:19,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the Super Nintendo Controller.

397
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a lot less complicated.

398
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:27,409
[SPEAKER_01]: The Super Nintendo Controller, though, is also one of the primary inspirations for the PlayStation Controller.

399
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm sorry that you'll be handicapped when you get to the fighting game portions of Final Fantasy XIII.

400
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:33,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, shut up.

401
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:34,214
[SPEAKER_09]: We're moving on.

402
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:43,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, other big news out of Microsoft's press conference that has to do with the installation of Xbox 360 games to your hard drive.

403
00:28:43,438 --> 00:28:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually announced that now you're going to be able to actually copy the games to your hard drive so you can play the games directly off your hard drive.

404
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:58,505
[SPEAKER_09]: But, if you're thinking this means, haha, I can get them from Gamefly, copy them to my hard drive and send them back, no, you still have to have the original disc to play the game.

405
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:01,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious how long that takes to get cracked though.

406
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, not long.

407
00:29:02,406 --> 00:29:03,387
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious because

408
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,789
[SPEAKER_09]: People could probably burn their own CDs and bypass it.

409
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:09,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very interested to see how they security lock this.

410
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,011
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

411
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:11,032
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

412
00:29:11,672 --> 00:29:14,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you're going to be able to access the marketplace on the web.

413
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:27,244
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're not next to the 360, you're surfing the internet at work like you shouldn't be, you can actually go on the internet and queue up downloads to automatically go to your 360, which sounds kind of interesting.

414
00:29:27,264 --> 00:29:29,345
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be pretty awesome is if they had a mode.

415
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have this, I think, with the PS3 a little bit where you can...

416
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:36,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Access your content from any hotspot or something like that.

417
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:48,862
[SPEAKER_08]: But what if you could, say, leave your 360 in a standby mode and queue something up to download on your 360 from a PC that's nowhere near it and then actually have it download while you're out.

418
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:49,583
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

419
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:57,005
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's kind of cool though if you don't like all those loading times on Xbox 360 on certain games.

420
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,105
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't sound like it's going to really help the load times too much.

421
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:02,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only going to improve them by 30% from what I read.

422
00:30:03,486 --> 00:30:03,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

423
00:30:04,747 --> 00:30:06,367
[SPEAKER_09]: What games do you think will benefit most from this?

424
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:10,228
[SPEAKER_09]: You can even do multi-disk installs though apparently.

425
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:13,709
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to install disc 2 and 3 of Lost Odyssey on your drive, you could do that.

426
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:15,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why you would, but you could.

427
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nice that it's an option.

428
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:46,610
[SPEAKER_09]: um you know that's nice in case you want to do that and you don't have to but it would be nicer if I didn't have to have the original disc I mean granted I understand why they're doing it that way if they didn't piracy would run rampant but I wish there was some other type of way it could be validated that I actually owned and bought the game because I would love to just you know not have to swap discs out all the time like just pop up a menu on my 360 pick the game and go like the arcade games I love that

429
00:30:47,401 --> 00:30:47,961
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice.

430
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:55,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they could do that, but... Maybe authenticating with a serial number or something?

431
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:56,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

432
00:30:56,165 --> 00:30:58,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a serial key just like they do with MMOs and PC games.

433
00:30:58,707 --> 00:30:59,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Question mark?

434
00:30:59,367 --> 00:30:59,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

435
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:00,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox?

436
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:02,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Think about that for next year's E3.

437
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:03,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to be able to do that.

438
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to me that the key code would probably be the best way.

439
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,141
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's also a problem, too.

440
00:31:09,181 --> 00:31:15,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if you look, I know this is a small market, but rental market, you know, if you're renting it out with the manual and the key codes in there.

441
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

442
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:18,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

443
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:18,875
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

444
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:26,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for anyone who's been looking for a sequel to Portal, there is an official one.

445
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,133
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually Portal's still alive.

446
00:31:29,373 --> 00:31:37,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be basically the single player story that was in Orange Box with some new challenges.

447
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:39,537
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be on the Xbox Live Arcade.

448
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:41,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing about PC or PS3.

449
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they already have this on the PC, actually.

450
00:31:44,992 --> 00:31:51,534
[SPEAKER_08]: They released a map pack that was based off the Flash Portal game, the 2D one, and that's what these levels are.

451
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:55,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the same levels that were available on the PC, I want to say for free.

452
00:31:55,556 --> 00:31:59,657
[SPEAKER_09]: But they've been la-di-da-ing this thing as an exclusive on the 360, right?

453
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:09,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It is exclusive on the 360, this version of the game, like as a standalone thing, but it really is just those download maps that were available on the PC for free.

454
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:11,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what though I hear about this game?

455
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:11,982
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no GLaDOS.

456
00:32:12,302 --> 00:32:13,282
[SPEAKER_09]: That kind of makes me sad.

457
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,183
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sadness.

458
00:32:15,403 --> 00:32:15,943
[SPEAKER_09]: It is sadness.

459
00:32:16,383 --> 00:32:17,823
[SPEAKER_09]: But hopefully there will still be cake.

460
00:32:18,164 --> 00:32:21,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this time, Jamie, maybe there's pie at the end this time.

461
00:32:22,305 --> 00:32:23,325
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's no story.

462
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:24,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just challenge levels.

463
00:32:25,546 --> 00:32:26,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the VR missions.

464
00:32:28,227 --> 00:32:34,228
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess, Jamie, you were quite the fan of Portal and I think a lot of the reason you liked it was the humor in it and the story, right?

465
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Does this kind of...

466
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:41,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, to me this seems a little bit milking, but I enjoyed the game in Portal 2, I really did.

467
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:48,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm kind of curious, what do you think about this, being that there's kind of less story, more just puzzle, puzzle, puzzle?

468
00:32:49,138 --> 00:32:51,541
[SPEAKER_01]: For the people who like the puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, that's good for them.

469
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want snarky commentary.

470
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:58,408
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no snarky commentary, then... But you could make your own!

471
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:12,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let Dan play it and then I'll provide the snarky commentary you know what would make this game awesome other than cake is if later on for a few more Microsoft points they could release a level editor

472
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,321
[SPEAKER_08]: for the arcade game and then release it where you can share levels.

473
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:19,643
[SPEAKER_09]: But then what would they do for the actual Portal 2?

474
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:21,124
[SPEAKER_08]: For the actual Portal 2?

475
00:33:21,404 --> 00:33:22,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

476
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:27,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, this might be Portal 2, but you know what I'm talking about, like a Portal actual full sequel.

477
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:29,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they can add some additional elements.

478
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:33,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for the Portal PC game, they had levels and stuff with alternate...

479
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:37,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Gravity sections where you're actually on the ceiling and stuff like that.

480
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:39,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Really twisty, weird stuff.

481
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:45,644
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they add that into Portal 2, and I think Portal 2 is supposed to be kind of different than Portal 1 altogether.

482
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,187
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, kind of a different environment, more like Half-Life.

483
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:51,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Then, yeah, there's a lot more to do.

484
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that Lesserface is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.

485
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:57,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus there's the guy that sounds like Colonel Sanders in there.

486
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:59,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the G-Man?

487
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:00,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

488
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:07,678
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, the new guy, the new ghost of portal creator guy or whatever.

489
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:13,588
[SPEAKER_01]: The one whose initials that you enter into the website to do the test that you can't save the results of.

490
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:14,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess.

491
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:20,729
[SPEAKER_09]: SSJ100Matt says in chat, they better give a free Carvel cake coupon with the new portal because they lied to us last time.

492
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:21,389
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be funny.

493
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,110
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be great.

494
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:29,294
[SPEAKER_09]: And some folks in chat are imagining the play at home with DarkSakura making the commentary to Dan while he's playing.

495
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:33,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Joshi16 says, DarkSakura to Dan, play better.

496
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:38,439
[SPEAKER_09]: And ActDeft says, complete the puzzle or the cube dies.

497
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:40,297
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

498
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:45,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the time with Dan playing is me just trying to shut up because I figured out the puzzle.

499
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:47,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Only I get too motion sick to do it.

500
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be sitting there going, and he'll be like, what?

501
00:34:50,821 --> 00:34:53,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, you should have done the portal over there.

502
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then it'll come up over here, and if you do it this way, then this will happen.

503
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:58,184
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, oh.

504
00:35:00,084 --> 00:35:04,306
[SPEAKER_09]: He has that little, what I call the Charlie Brown cloud with a little cloud of steam over their head.

505
00:35:04,366 --> 00:35:06,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to just bite my lip and not say anything.

506
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:07,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow.

507
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:10,093
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anyway, moving on.

508
00:35:11,374 --> 00:35:11,634
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

509
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:18,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, other news coming out of the Microsoft press conference.

510
00:35:18,477 --> 00:35:23,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is a total shock because this was kept under super secret wraps.

511
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:31,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Lips, their new karaoke game was announced and they had a lot of details on that, including...

512
00:35:32,816 --> 00:35:33,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Some pretty cool stuff.

513
00:35:34,097 --> 00:35:40,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously the microphones are going to be motion sensitive and they're wireless as they should be.

514
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:42,306
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got...

515
00:35:43,649 --> 00:35:43,949
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

516
00:36:14,169 --> 00:36:15,109
[SPEAKER_09]: This sounds interesting.

517
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down with lips.

518
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,891
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks a lot like Seeing Star to me, but I think Seeing Star is kind of fun.

519
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like this is Microsoft's thing.

520
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:24,792
[SPEAKER_09]: They take other people's ideas and make them better.

521
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:28,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, granted, it's not Microsoft themselves doing this.

522
00:36:28,173 --> 00:36:29,333
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Elite Beat Agents folks.

523
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:31,114
[SPEAKER_09]: But, hey, I love Elite Beat Agents.

524
00:36:31,174 --> 00:36:31,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks pretty cool.

525
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:33,655
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be a karaoke game.

526
00:36:33,675 --> 00:36:35,955
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some other cool stuff about that, too.

527
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,736
[SPEAKER_08]: They were saying that...

528
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:39,977
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

529
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:12,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, saying that they're not sure if they're going to allow you to stream, like, say, your library if you have a PC connected on your network.

530
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,618
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can stream music usually.

531
00:37:15,218 --> 00:37:16,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if they're going to allow you to do that.

532
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:20,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and also, um...

533
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:25,269
[SPEAKER_08]: No word if you're going to actually be able to implement your own lyrics or song chart or something like that.

534
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,753
[SPEAKER_08]: But they had some interesting ideas, I guess.

535
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the songs confirmed for it already.

536
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:36,341
[SPEAKER_08]: They had Mercy by Duffy, Young Folk by Peter, and...

537
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:42,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, Bjorn, John, and Bust a Move by Young MC.

538
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:47,725
[SPEAKER_08]: All the songs are master tracks and contain their original music videos.

539
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:49,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Rap songs work a little bit different.

540
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:53,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's not just about the rhythm in the game.

541
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:54,646
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool they have rap and singing.

542
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to rap.

543
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully we can get Loki to rap and put it on YouTube somewhere.

544
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

545
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:04,663
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

546
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:06,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you excited about Lips?

547
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:06,966
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

548
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:07,507
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

549
00:38:08,568 --> 00:38:10,230
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not a karaoke fan, right?

550
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

551
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:11,572
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

552
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:12,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll buy it.

553
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:13,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll admit it.

554
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:13,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I like karaoke.

555
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:18,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just hoping that it reads on my ABBA CDs correctly.

556
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:18,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

557
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:23,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you can put in your own music, we're having ABBA night.

558
00:38:23,454 --> 00:38:33,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what they should do is they should have it where you can plug in, you know, how they have the CDDB and stuff like that, where you can pop in CDs and it'll detect what songs it is and stuff like that.

559
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:41,904
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could do that, say, with this game as well, MP3s, and it'll detect what song it is and automatically download the lyrics, that'd be pretty awesome.

560
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:45,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to reenact the Mamma Musical, or Mamma Mia Musical, right here.

561
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:46,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be fun.

562
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,087
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

563
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:48,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Not on the air, though.

564
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Listeners have done nothing to deserve that.

565
00:38:51,511 --> 00:38:57,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, more details coming out of Microsoft's camp, including that big dashboard update that's been rumored.

566
00:38:57,196 --> 00:39:00,959
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a huge dashboard update coming a little later this fall.

567
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:08,005
[SPEAKER_09]: And apparently, some of the cool stuff that they're going to be putting in this dashboard update is Netflix integration.

568
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:13,349
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber and a Netflix subscriber, you can now use Netflix on your Xbox 360.

569
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You can stream movies from your Netflix queue to your 360, which I think is kind of cool.

570
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:24,795
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing is, though, only certain movies, the ones that they allow to be streamed on the internet, will do this.

571
00:39:25,335 --> 00:39:26,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Not in HD, sadly.

572
00:39:27,216 --> 00:39:34,919
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be SD only for now, but they say when Netflix is ready to do HD, Microsoft's ready to bring HD home.

573
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of interesting.

574
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:40,414
[SPEAKER_09]: The big shock and awe avatars.

575
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we didn't see anything of that coming.

576
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:47,237
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, the avatars, which are kind of like the Mii ripoffs, but of course, you know, they want to do a little bit better.

577
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:52,740
[SPEAKER_09]: So now not only do you have these avatars, but now you have these little like rooms that your avatars can go in.

578
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,121
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like home, but it kind of is.

579
00:39:56,161 --> 00:40:01,942
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even really, I mean, because it's just like this big white room, kind of like the construct.

580
00:40:02,422 --> 00:40:10,484
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still use your gamer tags pictures, like if you have an Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic, because we actually have one on the marketplace, I don't know if you've seen it.

581
00:40:11,004 --> 00:40:19,326
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in community gamer pics too, but if you have like your OLR gamer pic, you can still use it, but they are going to kind of try to get people to switch over to avatars, which, yeah.

582
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:23,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Games will now be able to give you Avatar Unlocks.

583
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,579
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not too much of a surprise when you consider games as it is can give you gamer picks.

584
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just that a lot of games choose not to do it.

585
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:30,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I got a question for you.

586
00:40:31,044 --> 00:40:32,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you feel ripped off at all?

587
00:40:32,427 --> 00:40:32,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

588
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:39,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you can use your themes with, I mean, but it's like in the background, like far background and stuff.

589
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,693
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not quite as integrated as before.

590
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:49,177
[SPEAKER_08]: But do you feel ripped off for buying, say, themes or gamer picks off of Xbox Live and now they're going to switch it all over to avatars?

591
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:53,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you know they're just going to fucking sell clothing and shit for your avatars.

592
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:56,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's how they're going to make even more money off that crap.

593
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,941
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Gaia.

594
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:01,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't bought any of that stuff in a while, so I'm okay.

595
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:04,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Ever since the OLR gamer pick came out, I have no use for other gamer picks.

596
00:41:04,132 --> 00:41:10,160
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as themes go, not a lot of that stuff makes me actually want to go, ooh, I want to spend a dollar for that.

597
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can get custom themes off your PC.

598
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:14,024
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as I can still do that, I'm down.

599
00:41:14,044 --> 00:41:15,626
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as I can still do that.

600
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:16,788
[SPEAKER_00]: That's special.

601
00:41:17,293 --> 00:41:37,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I want to point out real quick before we move on, another thing that was announced is Xbox Live Prime Time, and one specific thing that was announced is a version of 1 vs. 100, and this is actually something where they're going to have a live night where you can be a part of this game show thing using your avatars, and supposedly you're going to be able to win real prizes.

602
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:42,494
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could be playing in your Xbox as one of the people in the mob in this 1 vs. 100 show.

603
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,174
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds fun.

604
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:44,535
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of interesting.

605
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:45,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

606
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:47,678
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very casual gamer-friendly thing, too.

607
00:41:48,158 --> 00:41:50,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I can imagine whole families getting around to play this type of game.

608
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember they used to have some sort of service like that?

609
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:57,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's still around now where you could do that with TV shows and you'd actually be playing along with the live TV show.

610
00:41:58,427 --> 00:42:01,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Game Show Network does that on their website.

611
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily through that.

612
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,011
[SPEAKER_08]: This actually was...

613
00:42:05,434 --> 00:42:08,859
[SPEAKER_09]: It reminds me of the old Berkeley Systems games on the PC.

614
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you guys ever played Acrophobia or... God, there was the other game with the tower in it.

615
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:18,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And I apologize if you're hearing that noise.

616
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:19,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what's causing that.

617
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:21,523
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a cell phone noise or something.

618
00:42:21,603 --> 00:42:23,004
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a cell phone interacting with speakers.

619
00:42:23,024 --> 00:42:24,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I don't think they got that on the show.

620
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:24,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

621
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:25,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa, hello, live radio.

622
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,085
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it reminds me of that.

623
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that Berkeley System stuff back in the day.

624
00:42:30,806 --> 00:42:31,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to love those games.

625
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Those game shows are so much fun.

626
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:37,308
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out on Xbox.

627
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:41,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it doesn't all crash the first night because you know that's something that is likely to happen.

628
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:52,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in other news, more stuff for Xbox Live Arcade is a present for us from the people who brought us Pac-Man Championship Edition.

629
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:56,921
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Galaga Legions, so it's very shiny and pretty.

630
00:42:57,581 --> 00:43:09,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same sort of redesigned, you know, same type of play that, you know, is trying to stick with the style, but trying to beef it up for the modern era.

631
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,026
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's shiny.

632
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,040
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

633
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, but again, it's going to be one of those things where you start to go, why did I buy the original Galaga when this is available now?

634
00:43:19,604 --> 00:43:23,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the original Galaga came out in the 80s and you were probably five.

635
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know, but still.

636
00:43:25,762 --> 00:43:29,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, this resembles more like Geometry Wars than Galaga.

637
00:43:29,864 --> 00:43:31,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a lot more flashy.

638
00:43:31,605 --> 00:43:34,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of one of those things I want to get my hands on to see how it really works.

639
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:39,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because Pac-Man Championship Edition was only like half Pac-Man to me, you know what I mean?

640
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:45,191
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a whole different strategy to it than in the regular Pac-Man, even though at first glance it looks the same.

641
00:43:45,651 --> 00:43:47,492
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming Galaga will be similar, who knows.

642
00:43:47,932 --> 00:43:49,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking it's going to follow that type of suit.

643
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:50,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, most likely.

644
00:44:05,962 --> 00:44:08,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The DS, I know Rob is looking forward to this.

645
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:11,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy 4, maybe it's way out.

646
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:17,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Also on the DS this week, Azuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns.

647
00:44:17,386 --> 00:44:18,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know a lot of people like that one.

648
00:44:20,186 --> 00:44:25,348
[SPEAKER_08]: On DS as well, and I played a little bit of this a few weeks ago, New International Track and Field for the DS.

649
00:44:26,008 --> 00:44:34,231
[SPEAKER_08]: If you really want some frantic, I guess, stylus rubbing on there, that's going to be game for you.

650
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:39,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, also on PC, a bunch of smaller titles here.

651
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:47,641
[SPEAKER_08]: City Life 2008 Edition, Baseball Mogul 2009, Uber Soldier 2, The End of Hitler.

652
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:49,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome title there.

653
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:52,825
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see here on the DS.

654
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:56,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Nancy Drew, Mystery of the Cluebender Society.

655
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:03,693
[SPEAKER_08]: On the Wii, we've got Kids Sports Crazy Golf.

656
00:45:04,522 --> 00:45:07,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Another Shovelware title from Destineer.

657
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:12,262
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mummy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor on PS2, Wii, and DS.

658
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly enough, I think that's the biggest game this week.

659
00:45:15,745 --> 00:45:17,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And Order Up on the Wii.

660
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet another Cookie Mama type game.

661
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:28,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, this I believe is on the Xbox Live Arcade and PS3, or PS Network.

662
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:34,643
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got 1942 Joint Strike coming out on the arcade this week.

663
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:36,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy 4 on the DS

664
00:45:59,120 --> 00:45:59,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Not really.

665
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:01,543
[SPEAKER_09]: God, they have voice acting in it.

666
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to know one thing I learned from the voice acting?

667
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:06,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I always thought the main character's name was Cecil.

668
00:46:07,408 --> 00:46:08,388
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it looks like, right?

669
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:08,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Cecil?

670
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Cecil is apparently the name.

671
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:15,074
[SPEAKER_08]: If you listen to the voice acting.

672
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:21,120
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense because I don't think there's a C sound in Japanese.

673
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,741
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just surprised a little bit.

674
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:23,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know.

675
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,695
[SPEAKER_09]: All these years, I'm thinking one thing and it turns out it's the other.

676
00:46:27,735 --> 00:46:28,596
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just blowing your mind.

677
00:46:28,776 --> 00:46:30,416
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just blowing my mind, exactly.

678
00:46:31,037 --> 00:46:34,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the release dates that are going to be happening over there.

679
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:40,541
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, the entire Asia region is getting a version of WALL-E on the Xbox 360 this week.

680
00:46:41,181 --> 00:46:49,245
[SPEAKER_09]: But over in Japan specifically, Bully Scholarship Edition finally makes its way to Japan on July the 24th, as well as their local version of Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock.

681
00:46:49,705 --> 00:46:51,587
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the same song list, if you were wondering.

682
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:53,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It is not a J-Rock song list.

683
00:46:53,789 --> 00:46:57,072
[SPEAKER_09]: If it was, I'd be importing that shit because that would be a lot of fun, I think.

684
00:46:58,113 --> 00:47:05,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Kung Fu Panda, as well as the PlayStation 3 Eye Camera Pack.

685
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's some type of new eye bundle.

686
00:47:07,882 --> 00:47:09,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Siren.

687
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:13,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that like the remake of the first Siren on PlayStation 3 or something?

688
00:47:13,728 --> 00:47:14,569
[SPEAKER_09]: New translation.

689
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:17,410
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the episodic game now.

690
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:18,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, so there you have it.

691
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:19,791
[SPEAKER_09]: That's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

692
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Wangen Midnight finally gets a price reduction.

693
00:47:23,113 --> 00:47:24,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, because they gave me blue ass.

694
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:26,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Samurai Shodown

695
00:47:48,402 --> 00:47:52,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some type of... No, what Samurai Shodown is over here.

696
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:54,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, some type of compilation package it looks like.

697
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:55,166
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.

698
00:47:55,486 --> 00:47:58,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's their version of Samurai Shodown Anthology.

699
00:47:59,228 --> 00:47:59,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

700
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:03,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I'm surprised they wouldn't just do that for Virtual Console.

701
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're releasing Yo-Yo games on Virtual Console now.

702
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:13,156
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess if there are people that will buy it... Especially if it's got all the way up through 5 and maybe the 64 versions, even though they were shitty.

703
00:48:13,678 --> 00:48:22,282
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple price reductions on PlayStation 2, including Biohazard 4, Resident Evil, Busou Orenken, Burnout Dominator, as well.

704
00:48:22,862 --> 00:48:32,846
[SPEAKER_09]: But coming out new on the PlayStation 2 this week, their own version of Bully's Scholarship Edition, as well as the Samurai Spirits Anthology Collection comes out in Japan this week as well.

705
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:38,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving to the handhelds, the DS, you can get some new little sticky film things for your DS.

706
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,090
[SPEAKER_09]: All for the Peanuts gang!

707
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:40,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray!

708
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I guess the Peanuts are actually still really big in Japan.

709
00:48:44,992 --> 00:49:10,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Speed Racer comes out on the DS as well, Twilight Syndrome as well as SimCity DS gets a price reduction Kung Fu Panda gets another release over there on the DS and Kiraren Revolution Minna di Odoru Furifuri Debut comes out from Konami I'm thinking it says Revolution in the title so at first you think it might be a music game but no it's some other type of little action game that looks cutesy

710
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't know a lot else about that game, sorry.

711
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:19,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Checking out the PSP real quick, and then we'll call it a wrap for Japanese dates this week.

712
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:32,535
[SPEAKER_09]: On the PSP, you get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, a price reduction, Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus, and, oh, too bad there isn't a plushie, Infinite Loop comes out as well.

713
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:34,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Accent Core Plus would be funny.

714
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:35,558
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all stuffed animals fighting.

715
00:49:35,678 --> 00:49:36,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Fighting each other.

716
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:36,919
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be awesome.

717
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:38,460
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it for your Japanese release dates.

718
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:41,459
[SPEAKER_01]: In the UK, just a few things.

719
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:45,702
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 22nd, Izuna 2, The Unemployed Angel Returns on DS.

720
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:49,164
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 23rd, 1942, Joint Strike on Xbox 360.

721
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,745
[SPEAKER_01]: The same one to be out the next day on PlayStation 3.

722
00:49:53,166 --> 00:49:56,988
[SPEAKER_01]: 25th, Buzz Master Quiz, Race Driver Grid on DS.

723
00:49:58,169 --> 00:49:59,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9.

724
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,890
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, 11.

725
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:02,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.

726
00:50:02,231 --> 00:50:03,852
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I remember the first one.

727
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:06,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Swing Golf on Wii.

728
00:50:08,416 --> 00:50:29,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9 is on PC wow cool alright well the next big conference that we had up during E3 was of course Nintendo and one announcement that they made was that they're going to be branching out from their normal games and bring us a sequel to eSports

729
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:30,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

730
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:38,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Wii Sports Resort will be coming to the Wii, and it will be bundled with a brand new accessory that's called the Wii Motion Plus.

731
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:45,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And what the Wii Motion Plus will do for your Wii Remote is allow you to actually have one, one...

732
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,475
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.com

733
00:51:01,994 --> 00:51:06,897
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be coming with one of those and all the other ones will cost you extra money.

734
00:51:07,077 --> 00:51:10,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see... No, I haven't heard what the price of those were.

735
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Something was $29.99.

736
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:14,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it wasn't the Wii Motion Plus things.

737
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:16,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious how many games in the future will require this.

738
00:51:17,264 --> 00:51:17,564
[SPEAKER_08]: WeSportsResort

739
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:39,509
[SPEAKER_08]: A jet ski racing game, which I forget what they actually call it.

740
00:51:40,409 --> 00:51:44,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Looks kind of like, I guess, I don't know.

741
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,190
[SPEAKER_08]: A jet ski racing game.

742
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool.

743
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Wave Race 64, maybe.

744
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, they had sword fighting in there as well.

745
00:51:53,591 --> 00:51:54,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool!

746
00:51:54,371 --> 00:51:57,252
[SPEAKER_08]: But they made the swords look like lightsabers, sort of.

747
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:59,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, lightsabers!

748
00:51:59,772 --> 00:52:02,072
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving everyone the Star Wars game they wanted.

749
00:52:02,613 --> 00:52:04,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Except it's not really lightsabers, it's just...

750
00:52:06,214 --> 00:52:32,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Big Paul Nerf Sabers Nerf Sabers sounds fun there may be up to 10 games in this pack whenever it's released it's not supposed to be out though until spring of next year so got some time for that you know what's funny though out of all the E3 predictions out there I would think that a sequel to Wii Sports getting announced would be like a so freaking obvious thing I didn't see a lot of people predict that

751
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:37,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's my thing.

752
00:52:38,752 --> 00:52:44,433
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense for them business-wise because you have a problem where people are picking up the Wii and all they're playing is Wii Sports.

753
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:52,975
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they want to sell games to this market that's not really buying games, well, their best bet would be to put a sequel out for Wii Sports.

754
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:54,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

755
00:52:55,395 --> 00:52:57,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely going to be selling very well.

756
00:52:58,746 --> 00:53:01,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they're going to convince everybody that bought the Wii with Wii Sports.

757
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,194
[SPEAKER_09]: It would sell better if they get that crap out by Christmas.

758
00:53:04,955 --> 00:53:05,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

759
00:53:05,576 --> 00:53:06,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of surprised it's not.

760
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:08,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

761
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:11,364
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be interesting, I guess.

762
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:13,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll have to check it out when it actually comes out.

763
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:15,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Wii Music

764
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:32,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Coji Kondo

765
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,723
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, he didn't need to know that part.

766
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:52,027
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, you know, you see, and you saw a little bit of this I think at the year's feature on.

767
00:53:52,267 --> 00:53:55,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Well apparently, 50 instruments are going to be included in this.

768
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,051
[SPEAKER_09]: You use the remote, you use the nunchuck.

769
00:53:57,091 --> 00:54:01,454
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also tap your foot on the balance board to kind of simulate a drum set.

770
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:05,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently you're going to have violin, guitar, marimba.

771
00:54:06,317 --> 00:54:09,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping there's a sitar in this, but nothing's been said about that yet.

772
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:09,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I want a zither.

773
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Or an auto-harp.

774
00:54:34,025 --> 00:54:38,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is kind of sad, in a way, because it's kind of like a good concept.

775
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,672
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does sound like they took the game out of the game.

776
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:43,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you have a noise-making device.

777
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:44,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's the thing.

778
00:54:45,136 --> 00:54:45,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

779
00:54:45,897 --> 00:54:53,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Miyamoto came up on stage and said, Who would have thought that we would have sold millions of bathroom scales?

780
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:54,465
[SPEAKER_08]: And laughed at it.

781
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:55,186
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

782
00:54:55,646 --> 00:55:04,834
[SPEAKER_08]: and he laughed at it because you smug asshole and I don't really I'm not seeing that he's laughing at the people that are buying this stuff but

783
00:55:06,218 --> 00:55:07,138
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

784
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:31,128
[SPEAKER_08]: This is exactly what you'll be buying with this game.

785
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:36,532
[SPEAKER_08]: There's absolutely no way to play the song wrong because all you're doing is tapping buttons and pretending.

786
00:55:36,692 --> 00:55:37,413
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny though?

787
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:39,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I still think this game is going to be huge.

788
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:41,076
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there is an audience for this game.

789
00:55:41,116 --> 00:55:42,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, there is an audience.

790
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:50,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the casual market that will buy these shitty Destiny games that come out because they look cool and they'll drop $20 on them and the games are absolute shit.

791
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:57,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Miyamoto is a genius because, you know, us hardcore gamers, at least, you know, I'm looking at this going, where's the game?

792
00:55:58,369 --> 00:55:58,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the game?

793
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:00,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to sell millions.

794
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:01,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, great.

795
00:56:01,572 --> 00:56:06,715
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm glad that they're going to sell millions to this because, you know, they would sell millions of a good game as well.

796
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:15,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, their loyal fans who buy all these games that come out each time are kind of disappointed.

797
00:56:15,582 --> 00:56:15,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

798
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,685
[SPEAKER_08]: I was, like, after watching the whole press conference from Nintendo, I'm like...

799
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:21,046
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it?

800
00:56:21,647 --> 00:56:22,768
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a fucking waste of time.

801
00:56:23,028 --> 00:56:34,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to ask Jamie because she did say she was favorable to the orchestra thing when she saw it, but hearing that they've kind of taken the game out and now you've got a music simulation device, is this still interesting to you?

802
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:35,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very much so.

803
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:38,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I was a music major.

804
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in band.

805
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:45,186
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to get other people together who are likewise musically inclined and see what we can do.

806
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:48,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I loved a lot of the MIDI sims that did that.

807
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:51,553
[SPEAKER_09]: I worry, though, that this game isn't going to have that kind of depth.

808
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:58,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I would think, especially if you're going to get a bunch of music nerds together to do it, I would think that the game would need more depth, and I worry that this game is not going to have it.

809
00:56:58,403 --> 00:57:03,752
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, prove me wrong, Nintendo, please do, but... Jamie, they said that there's no way to play this wrong.

810
00:57:03,932 --> 00:57:04,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

811
00:57:04,873 --> 00:57:06,695
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

812
00:57:26,072 --> 00:57:27,393
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

813
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:55,832
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

814
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:59,854
[SPEAKER_09]: You did hit on something good, though, is that if it gets more kids interested in music, then it's a good thing.

815
00:58:01,115 --> 00:58:02,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was a band geek in school.

816
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:07,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think that they would add in some sort of difficulty or control level, you know?

817
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Add a little bit more freedom in what you're allowed to express with it.

818
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:14,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was what my thought was.

819
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:17,207
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's a didgeridoo in the game, I'm sold, though.

820
00:58:18,168 --> 00:58:20,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I take back everything I said to play the didgeridoo.

821
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:21,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's just...

822
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:25,944
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

823
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:49,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really give a crap about this.

824
00:58:49,478 --> 00:58:50,259
[SPEAKER_08]: This looks stupid.

825
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:56,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And sure enough, they come out on stage during the press conference now, and yeah, it was stupid.

826
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for totally fulfilling my expectations on this piece of product.

827
00:59:00,282 --> 00:59:05,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing about having the one button control is if I'm right, you are the conductor also, right?

828
00:59:06,164 --> 00:59:08,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they have a conductor minigame in there.

829
00:59:09,225 --> 00:59:18,727
[SPEAKER_01]: As a conductor, though, I can understand having the one-button melody part playing as being conductor because it is the conductor's job to signal when the next part comes in by following along with the music.

830
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:32,490
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, by reading the score, you have to signal to make sure that, first of all, even though the band is supposed to be keeping up with what's going on, they're supposed to know what you're doing, you still have to signal them, you still control volume, you know, keep the time.

831
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:33,950
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to follow you.

832
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I would expect that that would make sense for a controller mode.

833
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:38,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I just worry it's not going to have that kind of depth.

834
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just going to be, hey, kid, waggle the thing in the air.

835
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:42,633
[SPEAKER_09]: You're a conductor.

836
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:43,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Whee!

837
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:47,195
[SPEAKER_01]: They should have difficulty settings to allow for a broader market to play it.

838
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:50,160
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's nothing, there's no on-screen cues, there's nothing.

839
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:57,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's literally, there's a little drum beat going along and you decide whether you want to tap your thing with the song or whatever.

840
00:59:57,723 --> 01:00:02,985
[SPEAKER_08]: What they should have done, and this could have opened it up for the entire market instead of just... See, that's the problem.

841
01:00:03,085 --> 01:00:04,926
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't just develop for everybody.

842
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:08,147
[SPEAKER_08]: They just want to either develop for the casual market or the hardcore market.

843
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,268
[SPEAKER_08]: They can't see past developing something that would appeal to both.

844
01:00:11,786 --> 01:00:12,106
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

845
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:30,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And do it that way.

846
01:00:30,939 --> 01:00:34,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you're not interested in that, that's too complex for you.

847
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:36,902
[SPEAKER_08]: You can sit there and tap your finger to the music or whatever.

848
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:40,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we need to move on, but I will still close with this.

849
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:42,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if the game is a piece of flaming poo.

850
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:50,507
[SPEAKER_09]: If it gets five-year-olds saying, hey, I want to play a real marimba someday or I want to play a real saxophone, French horn, whatever, then it's a good thing.

851
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:51,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

852
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:53,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that you said saxophone and French horn together.

853
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:56,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have very complimentary tones.

854
01:00:56,429 --> 01:01:00,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I pulled instruments out of my ass that I remember from marching band.

855
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:03,172
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what game, though, I think they should make that would be a good music game?

856
01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:03,592
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

857
01:01:03,832 --> 01:01:04,812
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what a theremin is?

858
01:01:06,513 --> 01:01:06,693
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

859
01:01:07,153 --> 01:01:09,934
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses analog wave signals to play music.

860
01:01:10,054 --> 01:01:13,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's got one that goes out vertically and one that goes up horizontally.

861
01:01:13,756 --> 01:01:16,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use your hands in between the waves.

862
01:01:16,557 --> 01:01:16,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

863
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, I've seen that, yes.

864
01:01:19,681 --> 01:01:21,783
[SPEAKER_01]: You control the music that you play.

865
01:01:21,883 --> 01:01:24,564
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is your volume, and the other one is your pitch.

866
01:01:25,585 --> 01:01:32,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can wiggle your fingers a certain way, and it'll do staccato, or do it slowly, it'll be more flowing.

867
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:35,231
[SPEAKER_01]: But they should do a game that mimics a theremin.

868
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:36,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't that be cool?

869
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:40,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta get some comments from chat, because you know they're commenting on it.

870
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:42,736
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 says, I want Wee Cowbell.

871
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,474
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the cowbell in there.

872
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:47,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm serious.

873
01:01:47,156 --> 01:01:47,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting it.

874
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:48,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a cowbell.

875
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:58,804
[SPEAKER_09]: PKJr92 says, Rob, how would you play a didgeridoo with a Wiimote?

876
01:01:59,525 --> 01:01:59,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

877
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:01,486
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you going to play all this other shit with a Wiimote?

878
01:02:01,506 --> 01:02:02,127
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll make it work.

879
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:02,827
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Nintendo.

880
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:05,089
[SPEAKER_09]: They create miracles every day.

881
01:02:05,669 --> 01:02:08,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says, but those kids aren't going to do that, Rob.

882
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:09,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you're wrong.

883
01:02:09,632 --> 01:02:13,416
[SPEAKER_09]: They say more people are taking guitar lessons because of Guitar Hero, trying to learn how to play the real thing.

884
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:17,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what you're thinking, Debbie Downer, but I bet you're going to be wrong.

885
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:25,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to be all pessimistic or anything, but seriously, if you're really excited about Wii Music and you haven't watched the conference yet...

886
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:32,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I urge you to at least watch that portion of the Nintendo press conference because you will be disappointed.

887
01:02:32,955 --> 01:02:35,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, literally, it's just like, ouch.

888
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:37,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, new game.

889
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:38,439
[SPEAKER_09]: New Nintendo game.

890
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:38,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

891
01:02:38,919 --> 01:02:39,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff.

892
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:44,203
[SPEAKER_01]: The game called Nintendo Does Shit is coming out.

893
01:02:44,383 --> 01:02:44,903
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

894
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:47,805
[SPEAKER_09]: And Nintendo does shit all over your wallet.

895
01:02:47,845 --> 01:02:48,426
[SPEAKER_09]: It's amazing.

896
01:02:48,959 --> 01:02:49,980
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it prints money.

897
01:02:51,080 --> 01:03:10,390
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, though, the happy news, I think, of E3 for a lot of Nintendo fans, is Animal Crossing City Folk, which will be, I mean, basically it's the same sort of graphical style that we know way back in the Nintendo 64 era of Doubutsu no Mori, you know, because that was the first version that came out was on Nintendo 64.

898
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:12,571
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, they added widescreen and that's it.

899
01:03:13,071 --> 01:03:13,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

900
01:03:14,452 --> 01:03:14,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

901
01:03:16,386 --> 01:03:25,451
[SPEAKER_01]: But the neat thing about this one is that you can use your Wii message board to send messages to your friends, and you can put on masks that look like you're me.

902
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:26,832
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool.

903
01:03:28,173 --> 01:03:29,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially for whoever gets Goat Say Me.

904
01:03:29,954 --> 01:03:31,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray.

905
01:03:32,735 --> 01:03:39,299
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also a microphone option that's called Wii Speak, so you can talk to other players around the world.

906
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,521
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just pretty cool.

907
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:45,102
Cool.

908
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:48,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what to think about this.

909
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:48,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited.

910
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to buy it.

911
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:50,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting it.

912
01:03:50,421 --> 01:03:51,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, I'm getting it.

913
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:54,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to be able to send nasty messages to villagers everywhere.

914
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:57,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it's one of those things where it works a little better in theory.

915
01:03:57,305 --> 01:04:02,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the problem with Animal Crossing DS, the problem with that is that... There's no island!

916
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:04,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not just that.

917
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:11,471
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to coordinate with people in order to be able to visit their village, which granted was a step up from the GameCube one where they had to actually be at your house.

918
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:20,535
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's kind of why the DS one lost its charm is they really didn't add that much from the GameCube one and you kind of had to do all this coordination.

919
01:04:20,975 --> 01:04:28,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I am hoping in this one that it uses that WeConnect24 for a good thing where I can go to people's villages in the middle of the night and steal their fruit.

920
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:36,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus, I'm hearing they took the whole... Like, you know how there was like a game in it?

921
01:04:36,528 --> 01:04:40,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the game, in a sense, is to pay back Tom Nook for your house, right?

922
01:04:40,932 --> 01:04:42,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hearing they took that out.

923
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:44,795
[SPEAKER_09]: That there is no game now in Animal Crossing.

924
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:46,436
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just do stuff.

925
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:47,497
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.

926
01:04:47,537 --> 01:04:48,358
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't take that out.

927
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:52,701
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm thinking since it says City Folk, maybe it's going to be a much...

928
01:04:53,612 --> 01:04:55,353
[SPEAKER_01]: That is sort of very Japanese, isn't it?

929
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,060
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way.

930
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:23,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also kind of lame though, I mean, and I hate to put the specific spin on everything, but here's what they basically did with the city portion.

931
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:32,019
[SPEAKER_08]: The city portion, remember how there was little events that would happen at specific times during the week where you would have, I forget the bitch's name, they'd come and try to sell you the expensive...

932
01:05:32,339 --> 01:05:32,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Sahara?

933
01:05:33,019 --> 01:05:33,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Sahara.

934
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,460
[SPEAKER_08]: She would sell you the expensive clothing.

935
01:05:35,781 --> 01:05:37,501
[SPEAKER_09]: She sold the carpets, I'm sorry.

936
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:38,302
[SPEAKER_08]: The carpets, okay.

937
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:41,063
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the other people that would sell the expensive clothing.

938
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,705
[SPEAKER_08]: They had the people that would sell the rare furniture and stuff like that.

939
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:45,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

940
01:05:45,765 --> 01:05:48,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you don't have to worry about going to your town specific days.

941
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:51,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You just go to the city and it's all there.

942
01:05:51,128 --> 01:05:52,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what's the point?

943
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:56,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the whole point is you go back to your town and actually be able to play it and stuff.

944
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,308
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

945
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:22,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Have special festivals, have a carnival maybe, something that happens in your town.

946
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:27,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They have very limited objects that you can maybe get like once a month or something.

947
01:06:27,027 --> 01:06:31,515
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and this wouldn't be a big surprise for me, but I honestly don't think there's going to be...

948
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:40,760
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be hardly any innovation from the GameCube version, let alone the DS version with this version.

949
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,501
[SPEAKER_08]: They're literally pumping out the same fucking game on every system so far.

950
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,242
[SPEAKER_09]: I did get the impression this game's kind of already in the can.

951
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:50,462
[SPEAKER_09]: That this game's just waiting to be released already.

952
01:06:50,482 --> 01:06:58,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's not a bad... I mean, the game's good, it's fun, and you'll play it for a while, and then you'll get bored of it like all the other ones, but...

953
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:01,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like they're not even trying.

954
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:03,451
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, we put out the same game again.

955
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,512
[SPEAKER_08]: People will buy it.

956
01:07:04,552 --> 01:07:05,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's release it.

957
01:07:05,432 --> 01:07:08,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see more things that you have to accomplish with other people.

958
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:09,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be great.

959
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:13,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you have to do, like in order to get super rare things, you have to work with somebody else.

960
01:07:13,975 --> 01:07:16,816
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because it would give this whole we speak thing a use.

961
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:18,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Because right now this thing is screaming gimmick.

962
01:07:18,937 --> 01:07:19,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have a job.

963
01:07:21,052 --> 01:07:22,833
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says a carnival was confirmed for City Folk.

964
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:48,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of cool.

965
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:50,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Frisbee says there better be a freak show in the carnival.

966
01:07:51,973 --> 01:07:52,753
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

967
01:07:52,773 --> 01:07:57,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to have the bearded lady move to my village.

968
01:07:57,696 --> 01:08:01,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I want more than four characters in my village, which would be nice.

969
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:07,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want, say when you're not playing your characters, that they walk around and do stuff, which would be also cool.

970
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:12,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to be able to put the Mii masks on the other villagers that are in there in case I don't like their ugly face.

971
01:08:12,686 --> 01:08:16,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Joshi16 says Animal Crossing is the new Harvest Moon.

972
01:08:17,037 --> 01:08:25,068
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have some comments you want to have read on air, chat.orangesoundtrader.com when we chat live on these Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific time at allgames.com.

973
01:08:28,285 --> 01:08:41,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, something that, the only thing during the Nintendo press conference that had me excited that this conference actually might turn around was the brief announcement that Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was coming to the DS.

974
01:08:42,349 --> 01:08:48,271
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is exactly all we know about it, other than it will take place during Liberty City, and...

975
01:08:49,574 --> 01:09:01,907
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, it's being worked on no word other than that what exactly this is but I'm excited because it's Grand Theft Auto and then immediately the conference turned around and went back to shit again

976
01:09:04,244 --> 01:09:04,624
[SPEAKER_09]: PSP PSP PSP

977
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:25,041
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

978
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:25,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

979
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:52,412
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

980
01:10:08,488 --> 01:10:35,738
[SPEAKER_09]: The rumored prices right now $2.99 for a standard definition rental $6 for a high definition download $14.99 if you want to actually purchase the movie No idea yet about high definition pricing Apparently the store went up right after the conference and you can get such movies as Rambo, Cloverfield, The Bank Job All right there That's cool they needed that But here's a tip Don't get Cloverfield on HD There's no point

981
01:10:36,977 --> 01:10:38,978
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't sell the movies in HD yet.

982
01:10:39,658 --> 01:10:40,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, not yet.

983
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:42,019
[SPEAKER_09]: But soon.

984
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:45,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon is the all-encompassing word for us, isn't it?

985
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:55,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, something else regarding the Wii and what Nintendo's got released is the Wii Speak microphone.

986
01:10:57,225 --> 01:11:01,010
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which they brought up the We Speak with Animal Crossing.

987
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,554
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's called a community microphone.

988
01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:14,888
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's supposed to sit on top of your infrared bar on top of the TV and bring up basically everything in the room from what I understand.

989
01:11:16,428 --> 01:11:20,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Hooray, so now everybody in my house can hear the obscenities people are shouting at me on the internet.

990
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:23,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's like a conference phone type of thing.

991
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:24,711
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see, we'll see.

992
01:11:24,971 --> 01:11:28,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an interesting departure from the traditional headset thing, I'll give them that.

993
01:11:28,933 --> 01:11:29,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I do like that, though.

994
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:30,693
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

995
01:11:30,914 --> 01:11:31,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate wearing headsets.

996
01:11:31,914 --> 01:11:36,316
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the device that I'm worried about, it's the implementation of it.

997
01:11:36,616 --> 01:11:37,276
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the thing.

998
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:39,977
[SPEAKER_09]: At least it's not a camera.

999
01:11:41,237 --> 01:11:41,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you that.

1000
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:43,298
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give you that.

1001
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:45,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a camera on my Wii.

1002
01:11:45,646 --> 01:11:49,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also, though, some other interesting news was...

1003
01:11:51,733 --> 01:12:08,938
[SPEAKER_01]: that especially regarding Sony is that they have released information saying that there will be a $399 80 gig PS3 available in September and labeled as the 80 gigabyte core pack.

1004
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:20,781
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually sounds kind of neat but it's definitely the price drop from the $499 bundle that currently has the 80 gigabyte system.

1005
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:23,576
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1006
01:12:40,794 --> 01:12:43,096
[SPEAKER_08]: and the PS3 is getting the same thing.

1007
01:12:43,116 --> 01:12:48,302
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have the 399 core system, the 80 gig, which, by the way, does not play any PlayStation 2 games at all.

1008
01:12:48,322 --> 01:12:50,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the same backwards compatibility as the 40 gig system.

1009
01:12:50,684 --> 01:12:56,471
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was about to say, actually, before you jumped in on what I was saying.

1010
01:12:58,052 --> 01:13:01,356
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, 40 gig system with a larger hard drive, so that's awesome.

1011
01:13:04,033 --> 01:13:09,996
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess though, having the 80 gig, if you're going to announce this movie thing, I mean, I guess that's what you're going to need the space for, right?

1012
01:13:10,396 --> 01:13:13,958
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to download all these movies, then they want you to have the bigger hard drive, right?

1013
01:13:14,278 --> 01:13:16,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the end, they win, right?

1014
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:27,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes it a lot more simplified, because if they just leave it at the 80 gig system, you can just do, okay, the PS3 system is $399, if you want this bundle, it's $499.

1015
01:13:27,405 --> 01:13:31,987
[SPEAKER_08]: But it kind of devalues the bundle a bit.

1016
01:13:33,604 --> 01:13:34,205
[SPEAKER_08]: God of War 3

1017
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:54,274
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1018
01:14:11,019 --> 01:14:11,380
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1019
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:17,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not only did Sony... Actually, I would probably go with the latest because they always seem to delay their releases of stuff.

1020
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:25,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not only did Sony announce the obvious, which I would say is God of War 3, but they announced something a little bit unexpected, I think.

1021
01:14:26,298 --> 01:14:29,362
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to do with what's a new type of game they're calling a MAG.

1022
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,383
[SPEAKER_09]: A massive action game.

1023
01:14:31,403 --> 01:14:34,586
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how an MMO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game?

1024
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:37,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is supposed to be like that, but with an action game.

1025
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, 256 players.

1026
01:14:41,391 --> 01:14:43,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there that many people playing online with the PS3 right now?

1027
01:14:44,953 --> 01:14:46,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, probably.

1028
01:14:46,413 --> 01:14:49,394
[SPEAKER_09]: 256 players can actually all play this game at once.

1029
01:14:49,794 --> 01:14:52,855
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just apparently this giant free-for-all type game.

1030
01:14:53,515 --> 01:14:55,856
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get live statistics actually as you're playing.

1031
01:14:56,216 --> 01:15:02,398
[SPEAKER_09]: It does look like a war kind of game and seeing as it is being developed by the folks who make SOCOM, it does make sense.

1032
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,798
[SPEAKER_09]: It's eight player squads is what you're in.

1033
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,299
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of interesting.

1034
01:15:07,643 --> 01:15:13,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of an expansion, I guess, on the 64-player multiplayer for Resistance 2.

1035
01:15:13,410 --> 01:15:15,712
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in squads on that as well.

1036
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:23,481
[SPEAKER_09]: I said a long time ago on this show, and I'm sure other people have too, we have these massively multiplayer role-playing games.

1037
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:25,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's our massively multiplayer other types of games?

1038
01:15:25,863 --> 01:15:26,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And here you go.

1039
01:15:26,704 --> 01:15:28,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they had Huxley that was supposed to be coming out.

1040
01:15:30,598 --> 01:15:34,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1041
01:15:35,221 --> 01:15:37,242
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's good, though, that they announced something like that.

1042
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:39,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's something that Microsoft doesn't have.

1043
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that can differentiate themselves.

1044
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,865
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I don't know.

1045
01:15:45,008 --> 01:15:50,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Home is still coming and it supposedly looks a little bit better from what I saw at the press conference thing.

1046
01:15:50,812 --> 01:16:00,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Loki's going to sum up some other E3 highlights for us, but first I just kind of want to go around and get everybody's highlights and lowlights from the press conferences.

1047
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Best announcement you heard and worst announcement you heard.

1048
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:04,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1049
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:08,905
[SPEAKER_08]: The worst announcement I heard was the entire lineup from Nintendo.

1050
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:11,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, that press conference was hard to watch.

1051
01:16:12,148 --> 01:16:12,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It

1052
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:14,440
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1053
01:16:43,296 --> 01:16:57,302
[SPEAKER_09]: um least exciting thing for me is that little motion extra device thing on the Wii because it's just now another piece of crap I'm gonna have to buy because other games are gonna have to implement this because it probably should have been in there in the first place most exciting thing

1054
01:17:00,629 --> 01:17:01,530
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1055
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,022
[SPEAKER_09]: A genuine surprise and something that sounds pretty exciting and different.

1056
01:17:22,943 --> 01:17:25,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And reminds me of the whole Berkeley Systems days.

1057
01:17:26,025 --> 01:17:28,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to say that's the most exciting thing I heard in those press conferences.

1058
01:17:29,748 --> 01:17:32,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, any other things from the big three we might have missed?

1059
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, starting off here.

1060
01:17:34,932 --> 01:17:37,274
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some Xbox Live Arcade announcements.

1061
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:38,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite a few of them, actually.

1062
01:17:39,836 --> 01:17:41,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Some surprising stuff, too.

1063
01:17:41,317 --> 01:17:45,140
[SPEAKER_08]: They were, of course, showing off Banjo-Kazooie 3 Nuts and Bolts.

1064
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:54,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, another announcement that they made along with that is that the original Banzu Kazooie will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade later this year, which is surprising because that was an Nintendo 64 game.

1065
01:17:57,688 --> 01:17:58,549
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1066
01:18:23,163 --> 01:18:25,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Castle Crashers, Galaga Legions, Braid, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2,

1067
01:18:48,829 --> 01:18:54,493
[SPEAKER_08]: All going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade within the next four to six weeks.

1068
01:18:55,673 --> 01:18:56,714
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fucking awesome.

1069
01:18:59,376 --> 01:19:02,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Other things, Halo Wars is supposed to be out the first half of 2009.

1070
01:19:03,158 --> 01:19:04,239
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked kind of cool.

1071
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,722
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some other stuff...

1072
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

1073
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:20,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I want to say that August 6th is when Geometry Wars 2 is going to be coming out, so that's pretty cool.

1074
01:19:21,942 --> 01:19:26,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really part of the press conference, but Apogee came back.

1075
01:19:27,503 --> 01:19:28,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember them?

1076
01:19:28,183 --> 01:19:29,343
[SPEAKER_08]: They used to do shareware games.

1077
01:19:29,383 --> 01:19:30,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they were awesome.

1078
01:19:30,844 --> 01:19:31,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that pronounced Apogee?

1079
01:19:32,004 --> 01:19:32,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is Apogee.

1080
01:19:33,024 --> 01:19:34,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Jill of the Jungle, like what?

1081
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:38,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they're bringing Duke Nukem to the handhelds.

1082
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:41,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Which made me ask, where the fuck's Dick Dinkum Forever?

1083
01:19:41,738 --> 01:19:42,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Bastards.

1084
01:19:43,263 --> 01:19:44,708
[SPEAKER_08]: But, that was interesting.

1085
01:19:47,278 --> 01:19:50,339
[SPEAKER_08]: They showed off a Resistance Fall of Man PSP game.

1086
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:51,839
[SPEAKER_08]: That's due out spring of 2009.

1087
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:56,560
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be kind of like the Killzone PSP game, so that's kind of interesting.

1088
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:02,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to make you very happy, Rob, actually.

1089
01:20:03,821 --> 01:20:04,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not really.

1090
01:20:05,361 --> 01:20:12,142
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rumors that that MotionPlus controller add-on that they're going to have, yeah, eventually it's going to be integrated into the Wii Remote.

1091
01:20:12,363 --> 01:20:12,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Shock.

1092
01:20:13,103 --> 01:20:14,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, all that money wasted.

1093
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:17,344
[SPEAKER_08]: for stuff that should have been there in the first place.

1094
01:20:18,004 --> 01:20:19,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I just glanced at Justin.TV.

1095
01:20:19,865 --> 01:20:20,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot about this one.

1096
01:20:20,765 --> 01:20:22,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you see the Sony game Fat Princess?

1097
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:26,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Farmboy44 in the Justin.TV chat says that.

1098
01:20:26,607 --> 01:20:28,148
[SPEAKER_09]: That game looks hilarious.

1099
01:20:29,548 --> 01:20:31,689
[SPEAKER_08]: That does look funny.

1100
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:39,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I want to say that... I'm trying to think what else that was really cool coming out of there.

1101
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:48,618
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, some of the gameplay stuff that they're showing off, like Resident Evil 5 looked kind of neat with the co-op and stuff that they announced that you can do there.

1102
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:49,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um...

1103
01:20:52,395 --> 01:20:52,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1104
01:20:52,795 --> 01:20:54,637
[SPEAKER_08]: The PlayStation Home stuff looked alright.

1105
01:20:54,797 --> 01:21:04,946
[SPEAKER_08]: The one cool thing that really impressed me, though, about the PlayStation conference was that they showed off... Actually, part of their presentation was done in LittleBigPlanet.

1106
01:21:05,567 --> 01:21:06,348
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really cool.

1107
01:21:06,368 --> 01:21:06,888
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool.

1108
01:21:07,268 --> 01:21:08,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a little bit of that.

1109
01:21:08,049 --> 01:21:08,430
[SPEAKER_08]: That's neat.

1110
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:11,192
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's how you make their conferences interesting, okay?

1111
01:21:11,472 --> 01:21:13,214
[SPEAKER_08]: That game has me absolutely excited.

1112
01:21:13,274 --> 01:21:14,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't wait to play that.

1113
01:21:14,795 --> 01:21:16,156
[SPEAKER_08]: October for that one, at least.

1114
01:21:16,937 --> 01:21:17,077
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1115
01:21:19,229 --> 01:21:21,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna say that was pretty much it.

1116
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:29,133
[SPEAKER_08]: There was really, you know, no big game announcements as far as, like, DS stuff, I think.

1117
01:21:29,653 --> 01:21:35,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, everyone was expecting, like, I think they announced a new Pokemon Rangers game, which is just whoop-de-doo.

1118
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:39,597
[SPEAKER_08]: No Pokemon Platinum announcement, even though we know that's coming.

1119
01:21:40,357 --> 01:21:46,640
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, once again, Nintendo said that this E3 conference was not about the core gamers, it was about casual gamers, which...

1120
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:49,443
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

1121
01:22:14,028 --> 01:22:18,531
[SPEAKER_09]: If we didn't take a minute to pay some respect to our elders in gaming.

1122
01:22:18,671 --> 01:22:24,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkSakura, having gone to California Extreme, I'm sure must have been inspired from hundreds of games this week.

1123
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:25,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't see this one there, though.

1124
01:22:26,235 --> 01:22:26,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1125
01:22:26,935 --> 01:22:28,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a little disappointed.

1126
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:28,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

1127
01:22:28,896 --> 01:22:29,276
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1128
01:22:29,337 --> 01:22:36,340
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have something completely, I guess, outside of the realm of what you saw.

1129
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Just something you were hoping and thinking about this week.

1130
01:22:38,702 --> 01:22:40,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So it must be pretty darn good.

1131
01:22:40,843 --> 01:22:41,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take a look.

1132
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:42,604
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the classic game of the week.

1133
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,160
[SPEAKER_09]: What should the kids be playing this week?

1134
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:56,643
[SPEAKER_01]: The game of the week is Kicks, which is one of my all-time, all-time favorite games ever, which became also the model for later stuff like Galactica.

1135
01:22:56,663 --> 01:22:57,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah!

1136
01:22:57,363 --> 01:22:57,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Woo!

1137
01:22:59,023 --> 01:23:00,663
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear the sounds?

1138
01:23:00,703 --> 01:23:01,944
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you got when you played.

1139
01:23:03,344 --> 01:23:09,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this little vector series of lines that would move across an empty rectangular space, and you were a dot.

1140
01:23:10,945 --> 01:23:13,366
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Attack of the Windows screensavers.

1141
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:20,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you had to do is box in to gain a super majority of the screen.

1142
01:23:20,937 --> 01:23:28,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So you also had these little spark things though that would travel on your lines that you would form to box in the kicks.

1143
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:34,006
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, it would, uh, if it hit you, it would destroy you.

1144
01:23:34,126 --> 01:23:39,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if the kicks hit the line that you were drawing, it would also destroy you, and you did have a timer, too.

1145
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:47,250
[SPEAKER_01]: So, your whole, um, the whole point of the game was to claim, um, a certain percentage of the screen.

1146
01:23:48,131 --> 01:23:48,211
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

1147
01:23:51,483 --> 01:23:58,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually managed to get the 95 percentile closure on the screen before just by making a trap box.

1148
01:23:58,609 --> 01:24:01,091
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires some pretty good strategy to do well.

1149
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:04,814
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a...

1150
01:24:07,799 --> 01:24:09,801
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1151
01:24:28,118 --> 01:24:41,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, as you progress through the game, you would actually get two kicks on the screen, which you could actually easily pass the level if you could bisect the screen so that one was on either side.

1152
01:24:43,123 --> 01:24:45,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is a lot harder than it sounds.

1153
01:24:45,804 --> 01:24:52,606
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very difficult game past the first couple of stages, but it's one of my all-time favorites.

1154
01:24:52,886 --> 01:24:53,427
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.

1155
01:24:53,727 --> 01:24:54,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

1156
01:24:54,587 --> 01:24:56,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever played Super Kicks?

1157
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:57,448
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've not.

1158
01:24:58,103 --> 01:24:59,104
[SPEAKER_09]: They have it available on MAME.

1159
01:24:59,124 --> 01:25:00,284
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only way I've played it.

1160
01:25:00,304 --> 01:25:01,725
[SPEAKER_09]: A little more graphics in it.

1161
01:25:02,465 --> 01:25:03,146
[SPEAKER_09]: But kind of fun.

1162
01:25:03,486 --> 01:25:10,010
[SPEAKER_01]: The versions of Kicks that I have is the Atari 5200 version and the Nintendo version of Kicks.

1163
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:11,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1164
01:25:11,951 --> 01:25:16,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really so simple and very frustrating.

1165
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:17,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to beat these stupid lines into a circle.

1166
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:25,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I remember in Super Kicks you'd get letters that you would actually unveil if you siphoned off certain parts of the screen.

1167
01:25:25,715 --> 01:25:26,435
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of interesting.

1168
01:25:26,695 --> 01:25:37,243
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the way that this, though, has been incorporated into, like, Gals Panic is, you know, uncovering certain portions of the screen instead of, you know, covering them with your blocks.

1169
01:25:37,543 --> 01:25:40,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get to see some boobies if you uncover the right part of the screen.

1170
01:25:41,005 --> 01:25:42,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in Miss World 96 Nude.

1171
01:25:43,187 --> 01:25:43,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1172
01:25:43,487 --> 01:25:45,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Which you know is a OLR favorite.

1173
01:25:45,768 --> 01:25:46,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1174
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:48,210
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1175
01:25:48,996 --> 01:25:50,699
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but the old school kicks is pretty awesome.

1176
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1177
01:25:54,176 --> 01:25:56,097
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing.

1178
01:25:56,517 --> 01:26:10,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The versions that are out, by the way, is Atari 5200, Commodore 64, DOS, Amiga, which is graphically enhanced, Apple IIGS, Game Boy.

1179
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:12,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually do have the Game Boy version now that I'm thinking about it.

1180
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:14,841
[SPEAKER_01]: NES and Atari Lynx.

1181
01:26:15,202 --> 01:26:20,023
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a port for the Game Boy Color that was called Kix Adventure.

1182
01:26:21,786 --> 01:26:25,952
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you're saying that it's on GameTap right now.

1183
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:33,083
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also find it emulated on multiple systems and get Taito Legends 2 and Taito Legends Power-Up on PSP.

1184
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:36,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Actdeft says, Kicks for Xbox Live Arcade.

1185
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:37,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, yes.

1186
01:26:37,522 --> 01:26:39,043
[SPEAKER_01]: But you were mentioning Super Kicks.

1187
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:44,085
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Kicks 2 Tournament in 1982 and Super Kicks that you were talking about.

1188
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:49,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's Twin Kicks that was a prototype as of 1995 that never came out.

1189
01:26:49,507 --> 01:26:54,069
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is a main release that you can play.

1190
01:26:54,169 --> 01:26:59,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was Volfield, but it was Ultimate Kicks Neo on PlayStation 4.

1191
01:27:00,491 --> 01:27:02,412
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also, of course, cell phone versions.

1192
01:27:02,572 --> 01:27:06,494
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was saying before, Gal's Panic was also based off of Kix.

1193
01:27:06,574 --> 01:27:08,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a dead clone of it, except for boobs.

1194
01:27:10,496 --> 01:27:14,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Capcoma Night in Busyland, which was on SNES.

1195
01:27:14,758 --> 01:27:20,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Jezball Sonics, Eric's Stix, Ultimate Kix.

1196
01:27:21,661 --> 01:27:23,342
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a minigame version in Bully.

1197
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:28,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And Stix Reloaded, which was a freeware version, were all knockoffs of Kix.

1198
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,451
[SPEAKER_09]: So plenty of ways to get your kicks on.

1199
01:27:31,931 --> 01:27:32,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1200
01:27:32,592 --> 01:27:32,932
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1201
01:27:33,613 --> 01:27:36,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1202
01:27:36,534 --> 01:27:39,336
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1203
01:27:39,356 --> 01:27:43,839
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're listening on the podcast, that means just let it keep playing because we're going to take a quick commercial break.

1204
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:48,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we're calling them not commercial breaks because they're just not paid stuff.

1205
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:50,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say with that, too.

1206
01:27:50,984 --> 01:27:54,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll explain at the beginning of part B. We're accepting your contributions for this.

1207
01:27:54,146 --> 01:27:55,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the antonym of commercial?

1208
01:27:56,127 --> 01:27:56,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

1209
01:27:56,968 --> 01:27:57,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Public service announcement?

1210
01:27:57,808 --> 01:27:58,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-commercial?

1211
01:27:58,129 --> 01:27:58,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-commercial?

1212
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:00,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Non-commercial?

1213
01:28:00,827 --> 01:28:02,808
[SPEAKER_01]: They're non-commercial breaks.

1214
01:28:03,048 --> 01:28:04,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they're indie commercial breaks.

1215
01:28:04,628 --> 01:28:04,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1216
01:28:06,029 --> 01:28:08,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercial means pretty much something for money, right?

1217
01:28:08,489 --> 01:28:09,390
[SPEAKER_09]: They're free breaks.

1218
01:28:09,670 --> 01:28:10,270
[SPEAKER_01]: Free breaks!

1219
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:11,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're going to take a free break.

1220
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:11,910
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1221
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,810
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a free break.

1222
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:16,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to explain really quickly, it's probably the only time I'm going to mention that.

1223
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:18,412
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you on the podcast, you will only hear our original...

1224
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:20,553
[SPEAKER_09]: and the promos on the free break.

1225
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:30,340
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you that are listening live tonight, you're going to hear a song or two as well because we actually need to take a stretch break, get some water and all that good stuff so you get a little bit longer when you're listening live.

1226
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:33,702
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1227
01:28:38,548 --> 01:28:39,489
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1228
01:28:55,968 --> 01:29:00,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Elf needs food badly, so please, think twice before shooting food this holiday season.

1229
01:29:01,311 --> 01:29:09,236
[SPEAKER_09]: The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault!

1230
01:29:09,817 --> 01:29:12,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, don't shoot food.

1231
01:29:19,162 --> 01:29:24,686
[SPEAKER_02]: From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes...

1232
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:28,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix

1233
01:29:30,663 --> 01:29:41,428
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, animal-pissing, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.

1234
01:29:41,768 --> 01:29:49,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts.

1235
01:29:50,832 --> 01:29:54,634
[SPEAKER_12]: When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer.

1236
01:29:54,894 --> 01:29:56,695
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm down on my knees.

1237
01:29:57,319 --> 01:29:58,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm staying in.

1238
01:29:59,681 --> 01:30:03,885
[SPEAKER_12]: I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.

1239
01:30:04,085 --> 01:30:04,926
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura?

1240
01:30:06,187 --> 01:30:15,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a bonfire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.

1241
01:30:16,196 --> 01:30:16,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1242
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:19,780
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.

1243
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:23,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get strung out by the way I look.

1244
01:30:24,531 --> 01:30:27,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't judge a book by its cover.

1245
01:30:27,154 --> 01:30:28,495
[SPEAKER_09]: John DMN Bressler.

1246
01:30:28,815 --> 01:30:29,916
[SPEAKER_09]: You ever go to Duck Island?

1247
01:30:30,997 --> 01:30:32,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Your mom goes to Duck Island.

1248
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:39,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And a ton of license music inspired by the show that the RIAA and Laura Steele UT don't want you to hear.

1249
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:45,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.

1250
01:30:45,172 --> 01:30:48,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd.

1251
01:30:48,593 --> 01:30:53,315
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.

1252
01:30:53,455 --> 01:30:59,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.

1253
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:01,478
[SPEAKER_01]: But I poop from there.

1254
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only from the Nintendo Wii.

1255
01:31:05,482 --> 01:31:13,189
[SPEAKER_02]: So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a WorldCorp breach, bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

1256
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:15,532
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do, Loki might dress up as Tim.

1257
01:31:15,692 --> 01:31:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a guarantee.

1258
01:31:18,134 --> 01:31:23,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.

1259
01:31:23,547 --> 01:31:27,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.

1260
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:33,333
[SPEAKER_07]: To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.

1261
01:31:33,633 --> 01:31:35,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, except that asshole.

1262
01:31:36,035 --> 01:31:38,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1263
01:31:38,997 --> 01:31:47,962
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.

1264
01:31:49,683 --> 01:31:50,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone get the hook.

1265
01:31:50,584 --> 01:31:52,305
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1266
01:31:53,874 --> 01:31:55,777
[SPEAKER_09]: This lovely July 20th, 2008.

1267
01:31:56,578 --> 01:31:58,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie has a very perplexed look on her face.

1268
01:31:58,601 --> 01:31:59,823
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like she swallowed a fly.

1269
01:32:00,023 --> 01:32:00,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm twitching.

1270
01:32:01,185 --> 01:32:02,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope she won't die.

1271
01:32:04,582 --> 01:32:05,082
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1272
01:32:27,003 --> 01:32:28,864
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

1273
01:32:56,908 --> 01:32:57,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob can count.

1274
01:32:57,808 --> 01:32:58,308
[SPEAKER_09]: I can.

1275
01:32:58,389 --> 01:32:58,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a winner.

1276
01:32:58,929 --> 01:33:02,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, more news from E3 that didn't necessarily directly have to do with the press conference.

1277
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:04,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, start us off.

1278
01:33:04,732 --> 01:33:05,933
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an announcement.

1279
01:33:06,053 --> 01:33:09,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why they decided to cut this because it's... I don't know.

1280
01:33:09,836 --> 01:33:13,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems kind of no-brainer to me that I would announce this during an E3 press conference.

1281
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:18,861
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a new Halo game that they were going to be announcing, but we didn't have time.

1282
01:33:19,922 --> 01:33:21,183
[SPEAKER_08]: That was literally the excuse.

1283
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:22,283
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have time.

1284
01:33:22,303 --> 01:33:22,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1285
01:33:26,537 --> 01:33:28,018
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1286
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:53,101
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1287
01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:19,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should do a new Halo game based off of Red vs. Blue, which would be fucking awesome.

1288
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:19,866
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1289
01:34:20,106 --> 01:34:25,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so in all seriousness, a Halo announcement gets pulled for time.

1290
01:34:26,468 --> 01:34:27,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, what the heck?

1291
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they maybe just not have enough to go off of?

1292
01:34:29,128 --> 01:34:30,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe this game is just way too early in development?

1293
01:34:31,289 --> 01:34:32,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they sitting on it for PAX?

1294
01:34:33,009 --> 01:34:38,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they waiting for the giant orgasm that will fill the Seattle Convention Center when that's announced?

1295
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:40,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Do I smell Omegathon?

1296
01:34:42,029 --> 01:34:43,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it might be a little early for that.

1297
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that.

1298
01:34:46,451 --> 01:34:47,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, we get to watch a Megathon this year.

1299
01:34:47,812 --> 01:34:49,613
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be kind of rad.

1300
01:34:49,633 --> 01:34:52,314
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to sign up for a Megathon if we can.

1301
01:34:52,434 --> 01:34:52,854
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't.

1302
01:34:53,294 --> 01:34:55,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's randomly chosen out of people that pre-register.

1303
01:34:55,675 --> 01:34:55,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

1304
01:34:56,736 --> 01:35:01,298
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if we did get in as press... Yeah, we probably wouldn't get to do that.

1305
01:35:01,478 --> 01:35:05,740
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we don't get in as press, then that's disappointing.

1306
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Because even they have denied us.

1307
01:35:09,847 --> 01:35:15,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look, anyhow, so maybe this Halo game is just being waited on until later, but when later is, who knows?

1308
01:35:15,369 --> 01:35:18,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll just sit on it until next year when there's actually more game to show.

1309
01:35:18,670 --> 01:35:21,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Because even if they did announce it, I'm sure it's not a game coming out until 2010.

1310
01:35:22,451 --> 01:35:22,771
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1311
01:35:23,352 --> 01:35:26,193
[SPEAKER_09]: A game we had no idea was coming out here at Orange Launch Radio.

1312
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:29,434
[SPEAKER_09]: This completely took me by surprise that E3 was Dead Rising for the Wii.

1313
01:35:29,794 --> 01:35:32,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about you guys, but I was just, like, floored by this announcement.

1314
01:35:33,075 --> 01:35:33,195
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1315
01:35:33,235 --> 01:35:33,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard of this before.

1316
01:35:34,015 --> 01:35:34,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising for the Wii?

1317
01:35:34,976 --> 01:35:35,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1318
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:36,836
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just insane.

1319
01:35:36,976 --> 01:35:37,257
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1320
01:35:37,617 --> 01:35:38,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That's such an...

1321
01:35:39,534 --> 01:35:40,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I had never heard that on this show.

1322
01:35:56,131 --> 01:36:01,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're going to have sub-missions that you beat in the game, and then you'll do a major plotline quest.

1323
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:03,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So now the game has become a little more linear.

1324
01:36:04,497 --> 01:36:09,600
[SPEAKER_09]: But some people actually think that might be a good thing, because some people thought the 360, the way it was done there, was a little bit frustrating.

1325
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:17,926
[SPEAKER_09]: The camera apparently has now been changed, and now it's a behind-and-above type view, more like what they had in Resident Evil 4.

1326
01:36:18,326 --> 01:36:20,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So now it's kind of like one of those over-the-shoulder things.

1327
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:25,591
[SPEAKER_09]: And the photo mode is now gone, so you can't take the pictures.

1328
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:28,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't miss it.

1329
01:36:28,252 --> 01:36:29,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a little silly anyway.

1330
01:36:29,552 --> 01:36:30,193
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun for a minute.

1331
01:36:30,233 --> 01:36:33,314
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you can still run over zombies with a lawnmower, I'm happy.

1332
01:36:33,994 --> 01:36:36,615
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really all you need to make Dead Rising.

1333
01:36:36,635 --> 01:36:41,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And please God, save the save system.

1334
01:36:41,256 --> 01:36:42,977
[SPEAKER_08]: No, fix the save system.

1335
01:36:44,022 --> 01:36:44,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

1336
01:36:45,063 --> 01:36:47,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising Wii coming out soon.

1337
01:36:48,326 --> 01:36:49,987
[SPEAKER_08]: And by soon he means January.

1338
01:36:52,449 --> 01:37:00,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and I remember Bobby actually mentioning this on his show earlier, but there's some higher-ups that hate E3.

1339
01:37:01,276 --> 01:37:02,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Hate it, hate it, hate it the way it is.

1340
01:37:02,717 --> 01:37:06,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to consider myself one of those higher-ups, but apparently I'm the only one that does that.

1341
01:37:08,143 --> 01:37:13,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was actually stated by the EA big guy.

1342
01:37:14,788 --> 01:37:16,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now I'm going to totally butcher his last name.

1343
01:37:16,589 --> 01:37:17,490
[SPEAKER_01]: His first name is John.

1344
01:37:18,131 --> 01:37:21,013
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Riccitello, I think.

1345
01:37:21,693 --> 01:37:22,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

1346
01:37:22,574 --> 01:37:25,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he's quoted as saying, I hate E3 like this.

1347
01:37:26,497 --> 01:37:29,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And that they want to go back to the old E3 or do their own private events.

1348
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:36,344
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Ubisoft director, well, the Ubisoft boss said, yeah, it was terrible.

1349
01:37:36,365 --> 01:37:37,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1350
01:37:37,165 --> 01:37:39,426
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, to quote him, he said, E3 this year was terrible.

1351
01:37:40,266 --> 01:37:43,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The world used to come to E3, now it's like Pipefitter's show in the basement.

1352
01:37:45,348 --> 01:37:56,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny that the EA guy would be complaining, seeing as, well, EA was one of the four major companies that approached the ESA and said, we want you to change E3 because we don't like it the way it is.

1353
01:37:56,732 --> 01:37:57,752
[SPEAKER_08]: They're never satisfied.

1354
01:37:58,572 --> 01:37:59,353
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't know what they want.

1355
01:37:59,393 --> 01:38:00,173
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like little kids.

1356
01:38:01,287 --> 01:38:18,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was, it actually was Ubisoft, someone from Ubisoft named Alain Cor was also, you know, saying that he didn't really care for it all that either too.

1357
01:38:19,597 --> 01:38:24,720
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that I think should be pointed out is that

1358
01:38:26,497 --> 01:38:32,441
[SPEAKER_01]: While they were the ones that wanted it, I think they didn't expect it to turn out the way that it did.

1359
01:38:33,742 --> 01:38:42,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it was such a drastic departure that they are just now beginning to see to them what would be a detriment.

1360
01:38:43,789 --> 01:38:55,758
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I think was pointed out by Corey is that he's saying it's one milestone in the communication of your products throughout the year and it's important because it's the ramp on for Christmas.

1361
01:38:57,668 --> 01:39:01,310
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had said that in mid-July, that wouldn't be something appropriate.

1362
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:06,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I'm thinking is that if they wanted their big event, they should do something closer to the end of the year.

1363
01:39:07,412 --> 01:39:16,836
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, have E3 be your meetings and everything, and then do E3 to the sequel in November or something.

1364
01:39:17,156 --> 01:39:18,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is what E4ALL was supposed to be.

1365
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:20,698
[SPEAKER_01]: But people didn't see it that way.

1366
01:39:20,738 --> 01:39:23,819
[SPEAKER_01]: It should still be the same E3, I think.

1367
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:25,360
[SPEAKER_01]: The same format as before.

1368
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:25,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1369
01:39:25,959 --> 01:39:29,141
[SPEAKER_09]: EA still kind of strikes me as the Goldilocks of the game industry right now.

1370
01:39:29,241 --> 01:39:31,102
[SPEAKER_09]: This convention is too big.

1371
01:39:31,603 --> 01:39:33,364
[SPEAKER_09]: This convention is too small.

1372
01:39:34,064 --> 01:39:36,126
[SPEAKER_09]: They're looking for a convention that's just right.

1373
01:39:37,527 --> 01:39:39,348
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I don't know.

1374
01:39:39,708 --> 01:39:49,435
[SPEAKER_09]: All that aside, I just think publishers in part, the people that were going to E3, are partially to blame for why E3 went in the crapper.

1375
01:39:49,975 --> 01:39:55,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the year Paris Hilton showed up at E3, that was the year I was like, something ain't right.

1376
01:39:56,979 --> 01:39:58,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't believe the people who actually wanted to go see her.

1377
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:03,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So honestly, blame yourselves for ruining E3.

1378
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:14,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if they're going to bring E3 back on a big spectacle, which it seems like maybe EA is going to start bullying them to do it, have some freaking responsibility with what you decide to show at these shows.

1379
01:40:14,205 --> 01:40:16,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care if Paris Hilton has a cell phone game coming out.

1380
01:40:16,865 --> 01:40:17,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep her the fuck out of my show.

1381
01:40:18,386 --> 01:40:23,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what they should do if they're going to have the celebrity events like that, they put them in the...

1382
01:40:25,628 --> 01:40:29,291
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other hall that the little games had to hang out in?

1383
01:40:29,431 --> 01:40:29,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Kensha.

1384
01:40:29,932 --> 01:40:30,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they need to hang out there.

1385
01:40:31,493 --> 01:40:37,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a problem with them bringing celebrities or even non-celebrities like Paris Hilton because you know what?

1386
01:40:37,337 --> 01:40:40,360
[SPEAKER_08]: That's up to the game publishers how they want to promote their game and stuff.

1387
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:42,121
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they want to do that, fine.

1388
01:40:42,161 --> 01:40:43,322
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to go see it.

1389
01:40:43,442 --> 01:40:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It's whatever.

1390
01:40:45,404 --> 01:40:45,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1391
01:40:46,425 --> 01:40:55,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think, though, that they have to figure out what the hell they're trying to actually accomplish with E3 because the whole thing before was it's getting crazy because there's too many people here and we can't get business done.

1392
01:40:56,433 --> 01:40:59,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now that it's more intimate, are you getting business done?

1393
01:41:00,136 --> 01:41:03,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, you're not satisfied the way it is, then what exactly are you trying to accomplish?

1394
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,103
[SPEAKER_08]: I think once they figure that out, you know, maybe, I don't know, let's not take such extremes.

1395
01:41:09,544 --> 01:41:15,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we just keep it the way it used to be, but, I don't know, make it slightly more restrictive on who gets in.

1396
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:18,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1397
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:21,733
[SPEAKER_08]: What they need to do is just find a happy medium.

1398
01:41:24,796 --> 01:41:25,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1399
01:41:25,777 --> 01:41:27,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's move on.

1400
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:40,416
[SPEAKER_08]: So, other EA-related news is that EA formed a partnership now with id Software.

1401
01:41:41,036 --> 01:41:49,862
[SPEAKER_08]: And, of course, that also means that their brand new first-person shooter title, Rage, is going to be published by EA.

1402
01:41:50,543 --> 01:41:51,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's kind of neat.

1403
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:59,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other... I wonder if that also includes Doom 4, which...

1404
01:42:01,703 --> 01:42:04,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they actually announced anything for that.

1405
01:42:06,026 --> 01:42:06,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

1406
01:42:09,348 --> 01:42:15,132
[SPEAKER_08]: But yet another big developer to get under their EA belt.

1407
01:42:16,693 --> 01:42:17,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully do something with it.

1408
01:42:18,834 --> 01:42:22,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Slowly this big collective is being built even more and more.

1409
01:42:22,577 --> 01:42:25,118
[SPEAKER_09]: You will be assimilated into the big EA.

1410
01:42:27,179 --> 01:42:32,420
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that's not getting assimilated to EA though, because this is a Konami thing, this is Gradius Rebirth.

1411
01:42:32,761 --> 01:42:33,821
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of interesting.

1412
01:42:35,201 --> 01:42:42,903
[SPEAKER_09]: It's almost as if Mega Man 9 was just the beginning, because now apparently there's this new Gradius game that's going to be coming out for the Wii on WiiWare.

1413
01:42:42,943 --> 01:42:48,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, no news yet if it's going to come out for Xbox and PlayStation Network as well, like Mega Man 9 is supposed to be.

1414
01:42:48,624 --> 01:42:54,627
[SPEAKER_09]: But apparently, Gradius Rebirth is going to be coming out on the Japanese Wii systems around this summer, probably next month or so.

1415
01:42:55,468 --> 01:42:56,949
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's apparently what this game is.

1416
01:42:57,009 --> 01:43:02,251
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a remake of Gradius 1 or if it's a new Gradius game, that quite is not known just yet.

1417
01:43:03,132 --> 01:43:06,194
[SPEAKER_09]: The old school Gradius, though, is already available on the virtual console.

1418
01:43:06,234 --> 01:43:10,356
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would think this is some type of new adventure maybe based on the old Gradius.

1419
01:43:10,396 --> 01:43:14,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, this is kind of one of those series that people said they were kind of sad when it died.

1420
01:43:14,498 --> 01:43:16,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there was the one, there was what, Gradius 5 on the PlayStation 2?

1421
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:17,259
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty cool.

1422
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:17,940
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it kind of disappeared.

1423
01:43:19,561 --> 01:43:21,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, I know you're a big Gradius fan.

1424
01:43:21,183 --> 01:43:22,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this something you're excited about?

1425
01:43:22,844 --> 01:43:24,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything Gradius we get.

1426
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:27,589
[SPEAKER_09]: And it even has the Moai heads in it, which is pretty rad.

1427
01:43:27,769 --> 01:43:29,551
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have Gradius without Moai heads.

1428
01:43:29,711 --> 01:43:30,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1429
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:31,392
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

1430
01:43:32,053 --> 01:43:36,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming out in Japan this summer, and I'm imagining America soon enough.

1431
01:43:38,017 --> 01:43:47,261
[SPEAKER_01]: In other news, I guess sort of related to the Wii, this was actually supposed to go with my previous story about the status of E3.

1432
01:43:48,202 --> 01:43:57,266
[SPEAKER_01]: But Miyamoto is quoted as saying that E3 is no longer where they're going to be showing off games for the core audience.

1433
01:43:57,306 --> 01:43:59,046
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did mention this earlier in the show.

1434
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:00,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1435
01:44:01,761 --> 01:44:18,841
[SPEAKER_01]: but he said that he's quoted as saying that for a very long time E3 was an event where I guess the developers catered specifically to the core gamer so they're actually using it as something to bounce off the mass public the casual gamer their new market that they're trying to get a hold of

1436
01:44:21,142 --> 01:44:34,647
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said that E3 isn't the right place to point out their classics like Zelda or their major titles that have been their staple that their fans actually care about.

1437
01:44:37,182 --> 01:44:38,023
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'll see you next time.

1438
01:45:06,954 --> 01:45:09,797
[SPEAKER_01]: F you to the woman who nearly ran into my car on Friday.

1439
01:45:10,478 --> 01:45:32,957
[SPEAKER_01]: I was coming out of the parking lot to turn right onto the road so that I could go back to work and this woman turns directly into my car trying to pull into the entrance side of this little, you know, entrance leading back onto the road and lo and behold the bitch was on her phone.

1440
01:45:34,677 --> 01:45:39,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And Julie and I rolled down the windows and said, hang up your goddamn phone.

1441
01:45:40,522 --> 01:45:41,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And she looked confused.

1442
01:45:42,644 --> 01:45:48,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, bitch, if both of your hands had been on the wheel, you could have controlled the wheel enough to turn it in all the way.

1443
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:52,233
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very clear she was trying to turn the wheel with her hand and her elbow.

1444
01:45:53,414 --> 01:45:57,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, bitch, your phone conversation is not worth, you know, risking my life over.

1445
01:45:57,658 --> 01:45:58,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang up your goddamn phone.

1446
01:45:59,720 --> 01:45:59,980
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

1447
01:46:03,546 --> 01:46:22,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, F you to stupid people at movie theaters who get there either at the time of the showing or five minutes prior to it and expect to find a good seat, especially when people have sat down and have maybe one seat next to them and they want you to move over.

1448
01:46:22,938 --> 01:46:23,378
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1449
01:46:23,518 --> 01:46:32,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to the movie 50 minutes early just to have some idiot come right on time and tell me the move because you don't want to sit up front.

1450
01:46:32,321 --> 01:46:32,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, tough.

1451
01:46:33,061 --> 01:46:33,361
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1452
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:37,322
[SPEAKER_08]: If I got to the movie right as it's starting, then I expect to sit in the front and you should too.

1453
01:46:37,722 --> 01:46:39,223
[SPEAKER_08]: So fuck you inconsiderate bitches.

1454
01:46:40,823 --> 01:46:41,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was a fat cow too.

1455
01:46:41,884 --> 01:46:43,364
[SPEAKER_08]: She was playing with her cell phone during the movie.

1456
01:46:45,302 --> 01:46:46,182
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1457
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:09,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, okay, so I get to decide if I have surgery or not.

1458
01:47:09,569 --> 01:47:11,291
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of neat, I guess.

1459
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:14,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So I decide I'm going to go get a second opinion because I can't make decisions by myself.

1460
01:47:15,575 --> 01:47:19,758
[SPEAKER_09]: But the other one is that I've decided I kind of have too many hobbies going on right now.

1461
01:47:20,238 --> 01:47:23,281
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've made a difficult decision that I'm going to be cutting one of them out.

1462
01:47:23,381 --> 01:47:24,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not this one, don't worry.

1463
01:47:24,962 --> 01:47:29,566
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's always difficult because that kind of...

1464
01:47:30,507 --> 01:47:31,728
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the best way to do it?

1465
01:47:31,748 --> 01:47:32,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta do what I gotta do So

1466
01:47:57,907 --> 01:47:59,368
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not Warcraft either, sorry.

1467
01:47:59,849 --> 01:48:01,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I was going to say... No, it's not Warcraft.

1468
01:48:02,030 --> 01:48:02,450
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

1469
01:48:03,031 --> 01:48:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, it doesn't matter.

1470
01:48:04,772 --> 01:48:06,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the guessing game.

1471
01:48:07,174 --> 01:48:08,235
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something.

1472
01:48:08,655 --> 01:48:14,940
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something big that I'm going to hate to get away from, but I have to do it for me.

1473
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:16,381
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you later.

1474
01:48:17,421 --> 01:48:18,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1475
01:48:18,042 --> 01:48:18,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't read your lips.

1476
01:48:18,923 --> 01:48:19,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1477
01:48:20,564 --> 01:48:22,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so that's it for the FUs of the Week.

1478
01:48:23,086 --> 01:48:23,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1479
01:48:24,204 --> 01:48:25,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Other people are quitting WoW.

1480
01:48:25,486 --> 01:48:25,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not.

1481
01:48:25,866 --> 01:48:26,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I still love WoW.

1482
01:48:26,668 --> 01:48:28,931
[SPEAKER_09]: WoW's great, but I don't play it every day anymore.

1483
01:48:30,112 --> 01:48:30,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I play once in a while.

1484
01:48:32,008 --> 01:48:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently somebody out there was actually listening to me or at least thought the same thing when I saw the movie Wanted.

1485
01:48:39,252 --> 01:48:42,594
[SPEAKER_08]: They are bringing a Wanted game out to the market.

1486
01:48:42,694 --> 01:48:53,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Universal and Grin are working on a Wanted game and it will allow you to do all the fun stuff like curving bullets and going into assassin time as they call it.

1487
01:48:54,781 --> 01:48:58,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Only sad thing though is it's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

1488
01:48:58,343 --> 01:49:00,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really hoping for a Wii Wanted game because...

1489
01:49:01,405 --> 01:49:04,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think that'd be cool, especially with the new Motion Plus.

1490
01:49:04,646 --> 01:49:11,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you could attach that to the bottom of your, you know, Nyko Perfect shot and curve the bullets that way, but whatever.

1491
01:49:12,387 --> 01:49:13,007
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be cool, though.

1492
01:49:13,227 --> 01:49:13,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Worth checking out.

1493
01:49:13,988 --> 01:49:24,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it'll be out around the time when the DVD comes out, which is holiday, maybe, but, you know, if we're just seeing it now and it hasn't been developed for a while, it could be crap.

1494
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:25,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Scares me.

1495
01:49:27,352 --> 01:49:27,912
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1496
01:49:47,265 --> 01:49:57,591
[SPEAKER_09]: In the game, apparently, there's going to be PvP achievements, PvE achievements, achievements for exploring the world, achievements for crafting, achievements for questing and developing a character.

1497
01:49:57,651 --> 01:49:58,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all these different things.

1498
01:49:59,112 --> 01:50:01,654
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I like is that some of the achievements are silly.

1499
01:50:01,674 --> 01:50:04,676
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an achievement that you can unlock for giving 10 hugs.

1500
01:50:05,496 --> 01:50:06,417
[SPEAKER_09]: to other players.

1501
01:50:06,877 --> 01:50:10,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're just a hug slut, you get an achievement for that, which is kind of funny, I think.

1502
01:50:11,479 --> 01:50:17,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently there are really, really, really difficult achievements as well called Feats of Strength.

1503
01:50:18,082 --> 01:50:19,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So, interesting.

1504
01:50:19,523 --> 01:50:26,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming this is all going to be able to be tracked on Blizzard's website and the Armory and all that fun stuff too, but my question is what about all the stuff I've already done?

1505
01:50:27,046 --> 01:50:31,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Is WoW going to be capable of knowing that I've done all this stuff on my current level 70?

1506
01:50:31,969 --> 01:50:33,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's going to

1507
01:50:33,569 --> 01:50:40,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's how they're doing the PlayStation trophies is even if you've done this crap, it's not going to be able to know based on your save game.

1508
01:50:40,171 --> 01:50:41,452
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to go back and actually do it again.

1509
01:50:41,672 --> 01:50:42,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

1510
01:50:42,272 --> 01:50:47,454
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, other websites, I was going to say Newgrounds kind of does something similar with their Flash games.

1511
01:50:47,534 --> 01:50:52,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, all the Flash games have kind of trophies built into it and stuff.

1512
01:50:52,675 --> 01:50:54,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of neat that they do that too.

1513
01:50:54,796 --> 01:50:57,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, I think while doing it, it's...

1514
01:50:58,339 --> 01:50:58,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1515
01:51:19,358 --> 01:51:25,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, something else that's fairly cool, and this actually has to do with Silent Hill Homecoming.

1516
01:51:27,249 --> 01:51:34,359
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually showing that there will be our good buddy with the red pyramid hanging out

1517
01:51:34,939 --> 01:51:40,706
[SPEAKER_01]: in part of Silent Hill Homecoming and that it's going to have a PC version.

1518
01:51:41,687 --> 01:51:43,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's pretty cool.

1519
01:51:45,171 --> 01:51:47,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, I guess, the ones before it except for the very first one.

1520
01:51:48,315 --> 01:51:49,937
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's pretty cool information.

1521
01:51:50,117 --> 01:51:51,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he would have to be...

1522
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,020
[SPEAKER_01]: PYRAMID HEAD

1523
01:52:14,918 --> 01:52:16,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually going to ask you about that.

1524
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:26,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to forgive it for maybe bending the lore in Silent Hill to give the fans service of having Red Pyramid, Pyramid Head, whatever in the game?

1525
01:52:26,731 --> 01:52:29,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have some reoccurring critters.

1526
01:52:29,954 --> 01:52:31,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain same types of things.

1527
01:52:31,596 --> 01:52:32,897
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as he rapes things.

1528
01:52:49,868 --> 01:53:05,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyramid Head, for those who don't know, he goes around having his way with the female creatures of the town of Silent Hill including the double-sided mannequins and the nurses and then he goes around stabbing random women who keep regenerating.

1529
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:08,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to watch the Silent Hill movie again.

1530
01:53:08,577 --> 01:53:09,398
[SPEAKER_09]: God, it was great.

1531
01:53:09,518 --> 01:53:10,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over to my house and watch it.

1532
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:12,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, I want to watch it on Blu-ray.

1533
01:53:12,060 --> 01:53:12,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet it's pretty.

1534
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:13,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get it.

1535
01:53:13,801 --> 01:53:14,642
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have it on Blu-ray?

1536
01:53:14,982 --> 01:53:17,824
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I want it, and my husband's a butthole.

1537
01:53:17,984 --> 01:53:18,804
[SPEAKER_01]: He has it on Blu-ray.

1538
01:53:19,085 --> 01:53:20,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we watch it on Blu-ray once?

1539
01:53:20,426 --> 01:53:21,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love my husband very much.

1540
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:22,827
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not always a butthole.

1541
01:53:22,867 --> 01:53:24,508
[SPEAKER_08]: We did it at your apartment, your old apartment.

1542
01:53:24,889 --> 01:53:25,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we watched the whole thing.

1543
01:53:26,190 --> 01:53:26,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1544
01:53:26,850 --> 01:53:27,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We can bring it over.

1545
01:53:28,731 --> 01:53:30,633
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got, like, the Humongoy TV.

1546
01:53:30,793 --> 01:53:32,714
[SPEAKER_09]: We need Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Night.

1547
01:53:33,655 --> 01:53:33,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1548
01:53:34,015 --> 01:53:34,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1549
01:53:35,714 --> 01:53:36,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that should be a holiday.

1550
01:53:37,515 --> 01:53:39,876
[SPEAKER_01]: An official holiday of Orange Sounds Radio.

1551
01:53:40,076 --> 01:53:44,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear the creepy rabbits from number two, I think, are back.

1552
01:53:45,139 --> 01:53:45,739
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.

1553
01:53:46,399 --> 01:53:47,620
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to also have nurses.

1554
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:48,641
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to have nurses.

1555
01:53:48,981 --> 01:53:50,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want the screaming things.

1556
01:53:51,842 --> 01:53:55,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I would ask the chat room, what day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?

1557
01:53:55,864 --> 01:53:56,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Not Halloween.

1558
01:53:56,625 --> 01:53:57,325
[SPEAKER_09]: That's too obvious.

1559
01:53:57,385 --> 01:53:57,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other day.

1560
01:53:58,726 --> 01:54:00,847
[SPEAKER_09]: What day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?

1561
01:54:02,287 --> 01:54:02,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

1562
01:54:02,848 --> 01:54:03,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Tuesday.

1563
01:54:03,208 --> 01:54:03,789
[SPEAKER_09]: September 12th.

1564
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:05,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that?

1565
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:05,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1566
01:54:05,911 --> 01:54:06,772
[SPEAKER_08]: The day after your birthday?

1567
01:54:07,773 --> 01:54:07,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1568
01:54:08,213 --> 01:54:08,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you could do it.

1569
01:54:09,154 --> 01:54:12,358
[SPEAKER_08]: How about the release date of Silent Hill Homecoming?

1570
01:54:12,538 --> 01:54:13,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there you go.

1571
01:54:13,239 --> 01:54:13,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the day before.

1572
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:15,781
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the day that Silent Hill 2 came out?

1573
01:54:15,801 --> 01:54:16,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1574
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:17,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to look that up.

1575
01:54:17,625 --> 01:54:19,166
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be Pyramid Head.

1576
01:54:19,606 --> 01:54:22,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I will look that up and we will dub that Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

1577
01:54:22,648 --> 01:54:24,909
[SPEAKER_09]: I will look that up right now while we get into another story.

1578
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:25,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1579
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

1580
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:47,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is kind of weird and it may not actually be a confirmation at all, but apparently there are some people that performed some sort of social engineering prank that had 2K Games support believing that there is a hacked version of Grand Theft Auto 4's PC version, at least a demo of it, on a pirate site.

1581
01:54:47,697 --> 01:54:53,207
[SPEAKER_08]: and apparently there was some back and forth going on with the tech support.

1582
01:54:54,144 --> 01:55:00,929
[SPEAKER_08]: The PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4 has not even been announced for release and is still in development.

1583
01:55:00,969 --> 01:55:06,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not about to be released on a website.

1584
01:55:07,033 --> 01:55:11,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, people are reading into that thinking, well, it's still in development.

1585
01:55:11,075 --> 01:55:13,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that kind of confirms that it's actually coming out.

1586
01:55:13,677 --> 01:55:19,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But the whole thing is, does really their tech support know anything about games in development?

1587
01:55:20,502 --> 01:55:20,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1588
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:21,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1589
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:25,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would think it'd be kind of dumb if they didn't put out a PC version.

1590
01:55:26,793 --> 01:55:31,938
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know the last few PlayStation 2 games have been on, you know, PC.

1591
01:55:32,618 --> 01:55:34,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So, why not?

1592
01:55:35,220 --> 01:55:35,941
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe it's coming.

1593
01:55:36,181 --> 01:55:37,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Just might take some time.

1594
01:55:38,047 --> 01:55:40,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and I'm sure that makes a lot of people very happy.

1595
01:55:40,649 --> 01:55:42,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially because PC means easily hackable.

1596
01:55:43,251 --> 01:55:43,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1597
01:55:44,052 --> 01:55:45,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It means mod crazy.

1598
01:55:45,813 --> 01:55:46,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Mod crazy.

1599
01:55:46,634 --> 01:55:47,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

1600
01:55:47,194 --> 01:55:48,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the answer to the question.

1601
01:55:48,075 --> 01:55:48,675
[SPEAKER_09]: We did the research.

1602
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:51,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Hill 2 was released in North America.

1603
01:55:51,538 --> 01:55:53,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, North America got it first.

1604
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:54,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Japan got it three days later.

1605
01:55:55,241 --> 01:55:56,341
[SPEAKER_09]: September 24th, 2001.

1606
01:55:56,562 --> 01:55:59,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Too bad it's not the 23rd.

1607
01:55:59,624 --> 01:56:00,405
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's funny.

1608
01:56:00,645 --> 01:56:06,830
[SPEAKER_08]: September 24th, I think, is very close, if not the exact release date of Homecoming.

1609
01:56:07,975 --> 01:56:08,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

1610
01:56:09,396 --> 01:56:09,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you have it.

1611
01:56:10,036 --> 01:56:10,856
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that's it.

1612
01:56:10,916 --> 01:56:13,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we officially... No, September 24th is a Wednesday this year.

1613
01:56:13,977 --> 01:56:15,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So it might be like September 23rd.

1614
01:56:15,978 --> 01:56:17,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Or that might be the day you actually can get it in a store.

1615
01:56:17,898 --> 01:56:22,380
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's the 23rd, then we have the number of consequence.

1616
01:56:22,420 --> 01:56:23,340
[SPEAKER_08]: 24th can be a release date.

1617
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Games mostly come out on Wednesdays.

1618
01:56:25,701 --> 01:56:27,041
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a street date.

1619
01:56:27,081 --> 01:56:28,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they have the ship date, but you know.

1620
01:56:29,262 --> 01:56:29,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1621
01:56:29,722 --> 01:56:31,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we... But we have the official word.

1622
01:56:31,443 --> 01:56:34,364
[SPEAKER_09]: September 24th is Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

1623
01:56:35,208 --> 01:56:35,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Official.

1624
01:56:35,749 --> 01:56:36,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

1625
01:56:36,610 --> 01:56:37,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Done deal.

1626
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:37,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Sign.

1627
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:38,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the wax.

1628
01:56:39,332 --> 01:56:40,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get the seal, the OLR seal.

1629
01:56:41,214 --> 01:56:43,857
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in our new universe of Orange Loungia.

1630
01:56:44,277 --> 01:56:44,578
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1631
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:50,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that, Orange Loungia.

1632
01:56:50,083 --> 01:56:52,726
[SPEAKER_09]: How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?

1633
01:56:53,947 --> 01:56:57,291
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't tell them to rape things because, unfortunately, rape is not funny.

1634
01:56:58,930 --> 01:57:06,897
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just have them put on a big cardboard pyramid on their head and walk around with like, since you know it's really hard to find a great knife like that, walk around with a plastic knife.

1635
01:57:07,057 --> 01:57:10,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Walk around the neighborhood and threaten the cats in your neighborhood.

1636
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:11,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold a plastic knife.

1637
01:57:11,041 --> 01:57:11,941
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a plastic knife.

1638
01:57:12,922 --> 01:57:13,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And take pictures.

1639
01:57:14,063 --> 01:57:15,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Bake pyramid head cakes.

1640
01:57:15,685 --> 01:57:16,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, bake pyramid head cakes.

1641
01:57:16,825 --> 01:57:17,146
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1642
01:57:17,286 --> 01:57:19,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyramid head cupcakes and pass them out to the neighbors.

1643
01:57:19,408 --> 01:57:20,328
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to be red velvet.

1644
01:57:22,472 --> 01:57:25,753
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we want pictures of you celebrating Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

1645
01:57:25,853 --> 01:57:29,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best cupcake wins.

1646
01:57:30,636 --> 01:57:31,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Something.

1647
01:57:31,456 --> 01:57:33,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Wins eaten by the hosts.

1648
01:57:34,197 --> 01:57:34,937
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what would be awesome?

1649
01:57:35,037 --> 01:57:35,217
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1650
01:57:35,338 --> 01:57:36,138
[SPEAKER_08]: If we had a lot of money.

1651
01:57:36,818 --> 01:57:37,658
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a lot, a lot of money.

1652
01:57:37,939 --> 01:57:38,099
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1653
01:57:38,559 --> 01:57:42,661
[SPEAKER_08]: You get Charm City Cakes to build you a sculpture of Pyramid Head as a cake.

1654
01:57:43,741 --> 01:57:44,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1655
01:57:44,221 --> 01:57:45,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a friend that makes wedding cakes.

1656
01:57:46,561 --> 01:57:47,402
[SPEAKER_00]: That wouldn't be too bad.

1657
01:57:47,782 --> 01:57:51,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Shaoran in chat says, can I wear my pyramid-shaped tinfoil hat instead?

1658
01:57:51,405 --> 01:57:52,026
[SPEAKER_09]: You certainly can.

1659
01:57:52,386 --> 01:57:53,187
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want pictures.

1660
01:57:54,108 --> 01:57:54,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1661
01:57:54,728 --> 01:57:56,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Pyramid-shaped cupcakes.

1662
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:57,590
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do that.

1663
01:57:57,650 --> 01:57:59,852
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just kind of take a cupcake and kind of either...

1664
01:58:01,308 --> 01:58:02,089
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make your own molds.

1665
01:58:02,449 --> 01:58:03,770
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, seriously, contest.

1666
01:58:04,191 --> 01:58:07,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Dun-da-dun.

1667
01:58:07,513 --> 01:58:09,895
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rules are whatever we decide they are at the time.

1668
01:58:10,776 --> 01:58:17,142
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is a costume contest for your best, not necessarily cosplay, but just your best celebration of Pyramid Head.

1669
01:58:18,123 --> 01:58:20,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one is how pretty your cupcakes are.

1670
01:58:20,845 --> 01:58:25,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day is that PC.

1671
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:26,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1672
01:58:26,750 --> 01:58:27,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

1673
01:58:27,991 --> 01:58:30,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe rape victims might be offended by that.

1674
01:58:30,552 --> 01:58:32,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

1675
01:58:32,292 --> 01:58:33,193
[SPEAKER_08]: We might be offending some people.

1676
01:58:33,213 --> 01:58:34,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, it's just Red Pyramid Day.

1677
01:58:34,654 --> 01:58:37,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Pyramid Head Appreciation Day would be fine.

1678
01:58:37,135 --> 01:58:37,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Pyramid Day.

1679
01:58:38,315 --> 01:58:39,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Rape of people is not funny.

1680
01:58:39,796 --> 01:58:41,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Rape of monsters is funny.

1681
01:58:42,857 --> 01:58:44,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Because monsters are bad.

1682
01:58:44,998 --> 01:58:46,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And when bad people... What?

1683
01:58:46,599 --> 01:58:48,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not going to keep going down this line.

1684
01:58:48,039 --> 01:58:48,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Let go of the shovel.

1685
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm digging myself a hole.

1686
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:51,321
[SPEAKER_01]: How about... What?

1687
01:58:52,521 --> 01:58:53,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Pyramid Head Day.

1688
01:58:53,402 --> 01:58:53,742
What?

1689
01:58:54,696 --> 01:58:57,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I still like Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day, but only when it rapes monsters.

1690
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:59,341
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the rape appreciation event?

1691
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:01,403
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they should do?

1692
01:59:01,423 --> 01:59:02,344
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have a rape carnival.

1693
01:59:02,745 --> 01:59:03,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't that be cool?

1694
01:59:03,706 --> 01:59:08,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Is the mold your own custom, like... Or I can see the hate mail coming from a mile away.

1695
01:59:08,871 --> 01:59:10,693
[SPEAKER_08]: We should mold our, like, custom, like...

1696
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:21,403
[SPEAKER_09]: We need your ideas of how to turn this into a politically correct event.

1697
01:59:21,704 --> 01:59:22,744
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way, Rob.

1698
01:59:23,945 --> 01:59:25,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Shaoran says, I'm offended.

1699
01:59:25,446 --> 01:59:26,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of my best friends are monsters.

1700
01:59:27,006 --> 01:59:27,907
[SPEAKER_09]: You asshole.

1701
01:59:31,249 --> 01:59:35,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And no, Joshi16, there will not be a rape-a-thon this part of the day.

1702
01:59:35,211 --> 01:59:37,272
[SPEAKER_01]: This is horrible.

1703
01:59:37,292 --> 01:59:39,493
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's going to be Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.

1704
01:59:39,894 --> 01:59:40,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1705
01:59:41,488 --> 01:59:42,108
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll figure something out.

1706
01:59:42,169 --> 01:59:43,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1707
01:59:43,729 --> 01:59:48,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, in a completely different topic, I'm sure there'll be a lot of appreciation for this as well.

1708
01:59:48,632 --> 01:59:53,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It has been announced that BioWare and LucasArts, they are building the MMO for Knights of the Old Republic.

1709
01:59:53,896 --> 01:59:59,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this is different from the existing Star Wars MMO, but there is that new Knights of the Old Republic MMO that's going to be going on.

1710
02:00:00,119 --> 02:00:09,265
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cool, and you can see this whole thing that's posted, I guess it's on Portfolio.com, and it has been confirmed this is Knights of the Round...

1711
02:00:09,725 --> 02:00:11,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, Knights of the Round Republic.

1712
02:00:11,686 --> 02:00:12,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

1713
02:00:12,626 --> 02:00:14,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Knights of the Round, the old Capcom game.

1714
02:00:14,627 --> 02:00:17,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Knights of the Old Republic is online.

1715
02:00:17,188 --> 02:00:18,768
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Knights of the Old Old Republic.

1716
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:20,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1717
02:00:20,969 --> 02:00:24,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot think of Kotor without thinking of my friend who tested it and what they called it in office.

1718
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:25,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Who was that?

1719
02:00:25,811 --> 02:00:26,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Skrotor.

1720
02:00:28,552 --> 02:00:28,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.

1721
02:00:29,352 --> 02:00:29,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Very nice.

1722
02:00:30,532 --> 02:00:31,533
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there you have it.

1723
02:00:31,553 --> 02:00:33,433
[SPEAKER_09]: That game will be coming probably in a couple years.

1724
02:00:33,453 --> 02:00:37,054
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably still a little ways out, but I'm sure there's lots of people that are waiting to ditch WoW for that.

1725
02:00:37,074 --> 02:00:38,215
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be good times.

1726
02:00:38,837 --> 02:00:46,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyhow, we're going to get into another segment here on Orange Launch Radio that's good times because it's the chance for us to hear from the listeners.

1727
02:00:46,659 --> 02:00:47,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Mailbag segment.

1728
02:00:48,099 --> 02:00:53,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week we invite your emails at Mailbag, OrangeLaunchRadio.com and let's read some of those emails right now.

1729
02:01:00,002 --> 02:01:00,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, emails.

1730
02:01:01,022 --> 02:01:01,602
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some.

1731
02:01:01,622 --> 02:01:01,922
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.

1732
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:03,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, can I jump in here?

1733
02:01:03,211 --> 02:01:05,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's a great idea from Ossifer in chat.

1734
02:01:05,913 --> 02:01:07,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.

1735
02:01:07,634 --> 02:01:12,518
[SPEAKER_09]: The day that people across the world wear pyramid hats and rip skin off their fried chicken.

1736
02:01:13,459 --> 02:01:16,521
[SPEAKER_00]: It says ripping skin off chicks.

1737
02:01:17,342 --> 02:01:18,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but it's chicken.

1738
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:21,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So that way it's politically correct.

1739
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:25,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Ossifer set a good starting point.

1740
02:01:26,168 --> 02:01:27,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's a good idea in there somewhere.

1741
02:01:28,330 --> 02:01:29,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, sorry, mail.

1742
02:01:32,183 --> 02:01:33,263
[SPEAKER_01]: From Rob with two B's.

1743
02:01:34,343 --> 02:01:38,304
[SPEAKER_01]: A deer, two guys, a girl, and an olive garden, home of the never-ending salad and breadsticks.

1744
02:01:38,905 --> 02:01:41,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it me or is the news from E3 much more boring this year?

1745
02:01:42,386 --> 02:01:49,488
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that was a new Wiimote Shun add-on that more accurately judges the controller's aspect.

1746
02:01:49,928 --> 02:01:53,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't this a more or less throw-out to your old plastic thingies?

1747
02:01:54,269 --> 02:01:59,951
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't fit onto the zapper so maybe you won't need it for older games but there will have to be a new zapper.

1748
02:02:00,131 --> 02:02:01,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Are two zappers truly better than one?

1749
02:02:04,273 --> 02:02:04,393
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1750
02:02:05,673 --> 02:02:09,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can buy the Nyko Perfect Shot and then slap it into the pass-through in the bottom.

1751
02:02:10,775 --> 02:02:13,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that both games will probably be using the thing at the same time.

1752
02:02:14,416 --> 02:02:17,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you could just save yourself the money and not buy a zapper because they're shit.

1753
02:02:18,999 --> 02:02:21,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually don't agree that E3 was necessarily disappointing.

1754
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:27,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I think especially at Microsoft's camp, I think they did just fine.

1755
02:02:27,202 --> 02:02:36,785
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you knew that nobody was going to be announcing a new system this year, and I think the only thing that made Microsoft's press conference a little bit, we knew that was coming, was because of the leak that had already happened.

1756
02:02:36,845 --> 02:02:42,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if you hadn't known about the avatars in advance, I think it would have been a pretty big deal to see that new dashboard for the first time.

1757
02:02:43,287 --> 02:02:47,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And even still, we didn't know that the new dashboard was coming, we just knew that avatars were coming.

1758
02:02:47,588 --> 02:02:47,808
[SPEAKER_08]: True, true.

1759
02:02:48,288 --> 02:03:17,257
[SPEAKER_08]: and the other thing too is I like the format of the new E3 with all the press conferences because it's very much like gamers days and I think it's a lot easier to digest the information unless of course you're doing Capcom's press conference where all they do is talk about the fucking Lost Planet movie but no information out of that but I like the old show floor of the original E3 so if we can kind of do both that'd be awesome

1760
02:03:18,789 --> 02:03:31,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you notice that when we went to press events our last year of going, they were sort of off in those little rooms where they had the little trailer area set up inside the show floor.

1761
02:03:32,017 --> 02:03:32,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I loved it.

1762
02:03:32,658 --> 02:03:34,519
[SPEAKER_09]: When we got to go to Bethesda's thing, that was great.

1763
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:35,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved Bethesda's area.

1764
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:36,421
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so nice.

1765
02:03:36,501 --> 02:03:38,323
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just because it was chill.

1766
02:03:38,363 --> 02:03:40,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really actually liked PlayNC.

1767
02:03:41,525 --> 02:03:48,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody that let us in, I just distinctly remember Bethesda because they had a lot of stuff I was kind of interested in at the time.

1768
02:03:48,692 --> 02:03:49,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Call of Cthulhu.

1769
02:03:49,953 --> 02:03:50,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that?

1770
02:03:51,594 --> 02:03:57,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I think any company, even at the old E3, kind of getting off the main floor into those little back rooms and stuff was kind of neat.

1771
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:01,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Call of Cthulhu came out in 2005 on the Xbox.

1772
02:04:01,723 --> 02:04:02,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely missed it.

1773
02:04:03,124 --> 02:04:05,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't think anyone missed it.

1774
02:04:06,127 --> 02:04:08,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember being so excited and then I never heard anything about it.

1775
02:04:10,310 --> 02:04:17,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, to make it up, there is a new Cthulhu movie coming out that stars Tori Spelling.

1776
02:04:17,876 --> 02:04:19,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, not as Cthulhu, but you know.

1777
02:04:23,501 --> 02:04:24,402
[SPEAKER_08]: And she has a small part.

1778
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:26,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, so she's just a cameo.

1779
02:04:26,953 --> 02:04:27,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe she dies really well.

1780
02:04:28,634 --> 02:04:28,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

1781
02:04:29,175 --> 02:04:30,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe she's Cthulhu, I don't know.

1782
02:04:30,836 --> 02:04:31,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Cthulhu.

1783
02:04:33,038 --> 02:04:44,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Uber email, really long, and this comes from GS191, and it's really long.

1784
02:04:44,067 --> 02:04:46,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I read the first two paragraphs or something.

1785
02:04:47,669 --> 02:04:48,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's really long.

1786
02:04:49,511 --> 02:04:49,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello there.

1787
02:04:50,331 --> 02:04:53,053
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I've written anything to you all.

1788
02:04:53,514 --> 02:04:58,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, I'm still an avid listener of the show, even though I haven't been able to be in the chat room in quite a while.

1789
02:04:58,538 --> 02:05:04,442
[SPEAKER_01]: You can blame my World of Warcraft guild and them pushing me to level my Gnome Mage to 70 so they can get another crowd controller in the group.

1790
02:05:04,702 --> 02:05:05,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Go figure.

1791
02:05:05,863 --> 02:05:13,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, after sitting through all the big three E3 press conferences, I do have some choice words about all of them.

1792
02:05:14,312 --> 02:05:20,579
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I have to give many grats to G4 for showing all of the E3 press conferences for the big three with no commercials.

1793
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:27,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say, it was quite nice to see them on a 50-inch plasma TV, but standard definition for the loose.

1794
02:05:28,424 --> 02:05:30,425
[SPEAKER_08]: To be honest, it would be better just to stream them.

1795
02:05:30,485 --> 02:05:34,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard that they cut away for the Final Fantasy XIII announcement to show the audience.

1796
02:05:35,389 --> 02:05:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of, you know, viewing the wonderful trailer for Final Fantasy XIII.

1797
02:05:39,732 --> 02:05:42,574
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually had to, because there was a little thing that came up on the screen.

1798
02:05:42,614 --> 02:05:43,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you saw it.

1799
02:05:43,954 --> 02:05:44,795
[SPEAKER_09]: It got leaked out somewhere.

1800
02:05:44,815 --> 02:05:47,937
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a little thing on the screen that said, please do not videotape the following trailer.

1801
02:05:48,297 --> 02:05:49,178
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think they had to.

1802
02:05:49,298 --> 02:05:52,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet there is video footage of it.

1803
02:05:52,160 --> 02:05:54,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that was Square's thing, not G4's probably.

1804
02:05:54,722 --> 02:05:54,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1805
02:05:56,485 --> 02:06:15,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just in general, from what I'm seeing about the Microsoft one, is that I guess he seems pretty happy about Fallout 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, saying that they did a good job showing it and being excited about Final Fantasy XIII.

1806
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:21,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually going to post this email also in our forum.

1807
02:06:22,652 --> 02:06:24,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put a link to it in the chat room later on.

1808
02:06:24,853 --> 02:06:28,033
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a fairly lengthy email, but I think it makes some very, very good points.

1809
02:06:29,094 --> 02:06:36,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, Sony is having their demo of Resistance 2 and LittleBigPlanet demo and that type of stuff.

1810
02:06:37,136 --> 02:06:41,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be actually posting this in its entirety on the forum.

1811
02:06:41,997 --> 02:06:43,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in a minute.

1812
02:06:44,297 --> 02:06:44,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1813
02:06:45,297 --> 02:06:45,838
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really long.

1814
02:06:47,685 --> 02:06:49,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Ossifer's building on the idea.

1815
02:06:49,686 --> 02:06:52,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, this could be for the Pyramid Head Carnival, okay?

1816
02:06:52,888 --> 02:06:54,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaming events for the Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.

1817
02:06:55,129 --> 02:07:00,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Spin the Pyramid, Silent Hillopoly, Sorry, You Got Raped, and Twisted Pyramid.

1818
02:07:01,373 --> 02:07:03,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Twister, but in more compromised positions.

1819
02:07:03,674 --> 02:07:05,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, though, have to read the closure to his letter.

1820
02:07:06,716 --> 02:07:06,976
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

1821
02:07:06,996 --> 02:07:08,817
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from MichaelGS191.

1822
02:07:09,717 --> 02:07:12,859
[SPEAKER_01]: This email is brought to you by the never-ending disappointment that is Nintendo.

1823
02:07:12,879 --> 02:07:14,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's my fucking Star Fox remake for the Wii?

1824
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:16,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Or F-Zero.

1825
02:07:16,141 --> 02:07:16,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Get in line.

1826
02:07:18,908 --> 02:07:21,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, continuing on, shall I?

1827
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:22,130
[SPEAKER_09]: You shall.

1828
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:23,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Into other email adventures.

1829
02:07:25,092 --> 02:07:26,232
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually from Sauce.

1830
02:07:27,973 --> 02:07:29,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, gals, and ferrets.

1831
02:07:30,155 --> 02:07:31,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, wait, wait, where's the ferret?

1832
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:32,856
[SPEAKER_09]: The question, where's the ferret?

1833
02:07:32,876 --> 02:07:33,737
[SPEAKER_09]: You had the ferret earlier.

1834
02:07:33,777 --> 02:07:35,318
[SPEAKER_01]: The ferret was snuggling in my boobs.

1835
02:07:35,538 --> 02:07:35,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I see.

1836
02:07:35,798 --> 02:07:35,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah!

1837
02:07:37,546 --> 02:07:38,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that how you lost it?

1838
02:07:39,148 --> 02:07:40,190
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was actually sitting on it.

1839
02:07:41,852 --> 02:07:47,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I come bearing another video game review to add to the OLR collection, this time the game of choice is God of War, Chains of Olympus.

1840
02:07:48,782 --> 02:07:53,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm including a link to the review for the chatroom's reading pleasure, which I will link in the chatroom momentarily.

1841
02:07:54,289 --> 02:08:02,656
[SPEAKER_01]: The short version of the review is that Chains of Olympus is a fun, non-stop, action-packed game worth playing for any God of War fan or any fan of hack-and-slash violence.

1842
02:08:03,236 --> 02:08:05,758
[SPEAKER_01]: It has excellent graphics and sound and is definitely worth the play.

1843
02:08:06,559 --> 02:08:19,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone interested in keeping up with my video game reviews or articles about comics and movies, as are the three industries are very much tied into one another, can follow me on Twitter under MarrenMarvel for updates.

1844
02:08:20,450 --> 02:08:21,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good job, OLR.

1845
02:08:21,771 --> 02:08:25,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe someday Skye and I will rock the boat and you'll see the reviews on the OLR website.

1846
02:08:25,812 --> 02:08:26,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Winky face.

1847
02:08:26,432 --> 02:08:27,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Someday.

1848
02:08:27,933 --> 02:08:28,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Sincerely, Lauren.

1849
02:08:29,573 --> 02:08:30,954
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to link it in the chat room in just a sec.

1850
02:08:31,314 --> 02:08:32,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I need to read it still.

1851
02:08:33,555 --> 02:08:34,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious.

1852
02:08:34,535 --> 02:08:40,597
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious to hear what she thinks of it because I don't know if she's a huge God of War fan, so I'm kind of curious what she thinks of the PSP one.

1853
02:08:41,058 --> 02:08:42,178
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we'll see.

1854
02:08:42,848 --> 02:08:45,469
[SPEAKER_01]: The chat room has now been officially linked.

1855
02:08:47,510 --> 02:08:50,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So, last email, which came very last minute.

1856
02:08:50,472 --> 02:08:56,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Rob with 2B sent me other emails, but I'm going to save those for being related to last minute story stuff.

1857
02:08:56,815 --> 02:08:57,515
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty cool things.

1858
02:08:58,154 --> 02:08:58,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, OLR!

1859
02:08:59,675 --> 02:09:01,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Orange Box for PS3 a couple of days ago.

1860
02:09:02,037 --> 02:09:04,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe I waited so long for such a great game.

1861
02:09:04,499 --> 02:09:08,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I haven't played the original Half-Life, the story is still pretty easy to follow.

1862
02:09:09,863 --> 02:09:12,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of fun to guess what happened before, plus it looks amazing.

1863
02:09:13,526 --> 02:09:21,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Portal also made me smile at the sly remarks, but I have to say, playing the Flash game first makes the first bunch of levels much easier.

1864
02:09:21,653 --> 02:09:23,835
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone hasn't picked it up yet, do so immediately.

1865
02:09:23,895 --> 02:09:25,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Preferably not now, but maybe...

1866
02:09:27,017 --> 02:09:29,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomorrow during AGI since you won't miss the whole show.

1867
02:09:30,119 --> 02:09:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss a whole lot in the 20 minutes it takes to get it.

1868
02:09:34,502 --> 02:09:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm listening to the show right now and I hope that... Let me start over.

1869
02:09:38,725 --> 02:09:40,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I can get Skype to work this time.

1870
02:09:41,206 --> 02:09:42,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I look forward to the show.

1871
02:09:42,627 --> 02:09:43,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for reading this email.

1872
02:09:43,868 --> 02:09:47,631
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't read this email, then I guess there's no point in me thanking you.

1873
02:09:47,691 --> 02:09:48,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't, no thanks.

1874
02:09:49,972 --> 02:09:51,334
[SPEAKER_01]: and SincerelyPKJr92.

1875
02:09:51,634 --> 02:09:58,662
[SPEAKER_01]: This email is sponsored by everything and everyone else not yet mentioned, so now if you sign your emails, you'll be pirating my right to beat that.

1876
02:10:00,283 --> 02:10:00,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Alrighty then.

1877
02:10:02,668 --> 02:10:03,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dot com.

1878
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:05,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that it?

1879
02:10:05,931 --> 02:10:06,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1880
02:10:06,271 --> 02:10:08,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

1881
02:10:08,393 --> 02:10:09,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Email us some stuff.

1882
02:10:10,255 --> 02:10:15,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to not make it so epic though because then we don't have time to read it on air so we have to post it in the forums.

1883
02:10:15,239 --> 02:10:18,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that that's a bad thing but you know keep it concise.

1884
02:10:18,883 --> 02:10:19,884
[SPEAKER_09]: We like concise emails.

1885
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:24,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on with some gaming news, right, Loki?

1886
02:10:25,512 --> 02:10:25,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1887
02:10:26,353 --> 02:10:28,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

1888
02:10:28,095 --> 02:10:36,622
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some more details unveiled about the game, including that it will have 20-plus characters and download content as well.

1889
02:10:37,583 --> 02:10:46,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, they didn't really say too much else other than they were going to be splitting up the roster with DC and Mortal Kombat characters.

1890
02:10:46,771 --> 02:10:47,412
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also...

1891
02:10:48,753 --> 02:11:17,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Fatalities or Brutalities I guess for the Villains that are going to be in it So if you're playing as DC villains You can kill people but The DC heroes will not be able to kill people They'll just only maim I think No It depends which Batman we're getting Adam West's Batman never really killed anyone Wonder Woman killed someone With her bare hands Actually I do believe that Adam West should be in this game That would Sell it for me but

1892
02:11:19,231 --> 02:11:21,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam West, Batman should totally be in this game.

1893
02:11:21,292 --> 02:11:23,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Either way, you can expect this game in November.

1894
02:11:24,913 --> 02:11:25,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1895
02:11:26,094 --> 02:11:33,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Harmonix has given us a few details this E3 about the Rock Band 1 compatibility in Rock Band 2.

1896
02:11:33,457 --> 02:11:39,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, Rock Band 2 was a game that caught a lot of people's attention at E3 this year, and it's already kind of sneaking out there.

1897
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:43,701
[SPEAKER_09]: They showed the game at some side parties that were held and things.

1898
02:11:43,761 --> 02:11:44,521
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds kind of cool.

1899
02:11:44,961 --> 02:11:51,549
[SPEAKER_09]: and one of the rumors out there was that you were going to be able to have all your Rock Band 1 tracks in Rock Band 2 and it turns out, true statement.

1900
02:11:52,450 --> 02:11:59,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, what happens is that you're not going to be able to transfer all the songs because apparently...

1901
02:11:59,758 --> 02:12:00,699
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1902
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:43,864
[SPEAKER_09]: apparently though you are going to have to pay a small fee like maybe like a $5 fee to transfer the songs over but I still think it's kind of neat because man if you add like you know 60 songs from Rock Band 1 or however many you know they end up having and then your download tracks and the Rock Band 2 that's a lot of freaking songs seriously a lot of freaking songs so there you have it

1903
02:12:45,009 --> 02:12:49,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Rock Band 2 songs and Rock Band 1 songs together in one roof.

1904
02:12:50,102 --> 02:12:50,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.

1905
02:12:50,763 --> 02:12:52,187
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how they should be doing it.

1906
02:12:52,849 --> 02:12:52,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1907
02:12:53,513 --> 02:13:01,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in other news, there is a date out for Play TV, something that's going to record your TV shows while you're gaming.

1908
02:13:02,196 --> 02:13:10,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming out in Europe from September to December, the first release date being the 10th of September for the UK.

1909
02:13:10,999 --> 02:13:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a DVR that adds on to the PlayStation 3, so you can use it while you're playing something that you just happen to really be into to record whatever...

1910
02:13:21,983 --> 02:13:27,427
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a show that happens to be coming on while you're busy, you know, killing people in your game.

1911
02:13:27,688 --> 02:13:34,913
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, kudos for them for making an add-on for the PS3, but isn't that just a VCR?

1912
02:13:35,914 --> 02:13:36,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It's TiVo!

1913
02:13:37,415 --> 02:13:44,200
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can still record, I mean, like, if you're playing a video game, you can still record stuff on your TV, you just have it record off of a different channel.

1914
02:13:45,081 --> 02:13:49,564
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, remember how with the old VCRs you could watch one show while recording another?

1915
02:13:50,472 --> 02:13:51,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1916
02:13:52,413 --> 02:13:53,074
[SPEAKER_01]: It's TiVo.

1917
02:13:53,294 --> 02:13:54,435
[SPEAKER_08]: If it fills your need, I guess.

1918
02:13:56,216 --> 02:14:02,320
[SPEAKER_01]: They've also got release dates for Australia and New Zealand around January.

1919
02:14:06,662 --> 02:14:09,204
[SPEAKER_09]: We're having fun network issues in-house again.

1920
02:14:10,025 --> 02:14:14,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Live listeners are noticing that Justin.TV went down again and I think we're just going to pull the plug on that for the night.

1921
02:14:15,208 --> 02:14:16,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

1922
02:14:16,129 --> 02:14:16,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1923
02:14:17,554 --> 02:14:22,256
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't know how else to fix our network issues and usually JTV is the first thing that has to go.

1924
02:14:22,397 --> 02:14:22,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1925
02:14:22,977 --> 02:14:25,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you really want to watch people just talking?

1926
02:14:25,438 --> 02:14:36,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess people like Justin TV because there's not as much lag and that they can hear the things that go on during the break time and that I guess the sound's better but I don't believe that.

1927
02:14:36,504 --> 02:14:38,745
[SPEAKER_09]: The sound's crystal clear on all games so I don't get that.

1928
02:14:38,845 --> 02:14:40,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Well my network just came back up so...

1929
02:14:40,990 --> 02:14:43,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so just kill Justin TV for the night.

1930
02:14:43,073 --> 02:14:43,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, guys.

1931
02:14:43,654 --> 02:14:44,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty.

1932
02:14:45,396 --> 02:14:49,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's fun naked time, so ha-ha, you miss out, Justin TV.

1933
02:14:51,345 --> 02:14:51,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

1934
02:14:51,906 --> 02:14:53,368
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm taking my pants off right now.

1935
02:14:53,528 --> 02:14:55,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going wild.

1936
02:14:57,672 --> 02:15:24,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Guitar Hero On Tour Surprise is getting a sequel called On Tour Decades and I guess the first game sold just over a third of a million with 350,000 units sold in three weeks and the sequel no word on exactly when it's coming out there is rumors though that there might be some form of microphone functionality maybe karaoke um

1937
02:15:26,092 --> 02:15:26,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1938
02:15:27,133 --> 02:15:28,976
[SPEAKER_08]: No word though when it's coming out.

1939
02:15:30,358 --> 02:15:31,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Big surprise!

1940
02:15:32,601 --> 02:15:34,303
[SPEAKER_08]: A sequel for Guitar Hero game.

1941
02:15:34,824 --> 02:15:39,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hey, they wouldn't want to leave the DS out with 50 billion releases each year.

1942
02:15:40,031 --> 02:15:41,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, never.

1943
02:15:41,052 --> 02:15:41,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Never.

1944
02:15:42,895 --> 02:15:43,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby's Party

1945
02:16:11,917 --> 02:16:14,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically Imagine Babies, the party game.

1946
02:16:17,181 --> 02:16:22,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It's coming out this autumn, and apparently you actually use the balance board in the game.

1947
02:16:23,045 --> 02:16:27,328
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually play this at a babysitting academy, and there's 30 mini-games in the game.

1948
02:16:27,848 --> 02:16:29,409
[SPEAKER_09]: It's head-to-head, co-op mode.

1949
02:16:29,769 --> 02:16:35,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Both methods are available, and it's based on the typical day of a baby.

1950
02:16:37,294 --> 02:16:38,815
[SPEAKER_01]: What, eat, sleep, poop, cry?

1951
02:16:38,835 --> 02:16:39,456
What?

1952
02:16:40,566 --> 02:16:40,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby fart?

1953
02:16:40,867 --> 02:16:41,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Grow up?

1954
02:16:41,067 --> 02:16:42,028
[SPEAKER_09]: They can burp, they just need help

1955
02:16:55,209 --> 02:17:00,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what was the game they used to have at Milpitas Golf Land with the big buttons that was like the babies racing?

1956
02:17:01,211 --> 02:17:05,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they had that at, um, at the game, at the game, the convention too.

1957
02:17:06,592 --> 02:17:07,733
[SPEAKER_01]: It was... The hell was that?

1958
02:17:07,753 --> 02:17:08,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye Bye Baby, no.

1959
02:17:08,873 --> 02:17:10,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye Baby something?

1960
02:17:11,474 --> 02:17:13,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was some like baby racing game.

1961
02:17:13,094 --> 02:17:14,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on Baby, says AJ Mix.

1962
02:17:14,414 --> 02:17:15,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on Baby, yeah.

1963
02:17:15,915 --> 02:17:16,455
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

1964
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:19,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait for the breastfeeding minigame.

1965
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:46,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Me neither.

1966
02:17:47,781 --> 02:17:49,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, we've got a caller on Skype.

1967
02:17:49,422 --> 02:17:50,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1968
02:17:50,583 --> 02:17:51,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

1969
02:17:51,923 --> 02:17:53,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is GS68.

1970
02:17:54,125 --> 02:17:55,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, GS68.

1971
02:17:55,285 --> 02:17:55,746
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you?

1972
02:17:56,646 --> 02:17:56,966
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1973
02:17:57,727 --> 02:18:01,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, you got to go to California Extreme and you met Jamie live and in person, right?

1974
02:18:02,289 --> 02:18:02,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1975
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:05,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I've asked you this because I've always wondered this myself.

1976
02:18:06,192 --> 02:18:08,453
[SPEAKER_09]: What's Jamie like in real life off the air?

1977
02:18:10,774 --> 02:18:11,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time I...

1978
02:18:12,199 --> 02:18:19,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of didn't recognize her at first, because last time I saw her was at Final Mate, and she had, I think, magenta-ish hair.

1979
02:18:19,402 --> 02:18:20,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

1980
02:18:20,542 --> 02:18:24,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my hair was black in front and red in back.

1981
02:18:27,644 --> 02:18:28,905
[SPEAKER_01]: But this time my hair was all black.

1982
02:18:29,985 --> 02:18:39,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Jamie, when you're speaking in person, you sound a little younger than you do right now on the air.

1983
02:18:40,289 --> 02:18:40,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1984
02:18:41,112 --> 02:18:44,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the radio makes our voices bassier.

1985
02:18:44,514 --> 02:18:47,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, didn't Travis say I used to sound like a hyperactive 13-year-old?

1986
02:18:48,957 --> 02:18:50,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, but then you went through puberty.

1987
02:18:50,238 --> 02:18:51,099
[SPEAKER_09]: That was many years ago.

1988
02:18:55,241 --> 02:18:55,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, look.

1989
02:18:55,822 --> 02:18:58,103
[SPEAKER_09]: In all seriousness, how was California Stream?

1990
02:18:59,684 --> 02:19:00,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty cool.

1991
02:19:02,026 --> 02:19:03,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then.

1992
02:19:03,287 --> 02:19:04,708
[SPEAKER_09]: What games did you enjoy playing?

1993
02:19:05,348 --> 02:19:09,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there some classic games you'd not really paid respect to before that caught your eyes?

1994
02:19:14,666 --> 02:19:26,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the games I played were games that I already played and I was familiar with or I hadn't played in a while like the old Star Wars arcade game or Tron.

1995
02:19:26,034 --> 02:19:32,379
[SPEAKER_05]: I've played some games that I hadn't really played before like Tailgater and Looping.

1996
02:19:33,356 --> 02:19:33,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, build a meme.

1997
02:19:33,876 --> 02:19:33,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Ugh.

1998
02:20:01,158 --> 02:20:03,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want a real one.

1999
02:20:03,099 --> 02:20:04,380
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real.

2000
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:05,421
[SPEAKER_01]: You can touch it.

2001
02:20:05,781 --> 02:20:06,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, alright.

2002
02:20:06,321 --> 02:20:06,902
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see, we'll see.

2003
02:20:06,962 --> 02:20:08,482
[SPEAKER_01]: If you set it on fire, it'll burn.

2004
02:20:09,423 --> 02:20:09,783
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2005
02:20:10,063 --> 02:20:11,845
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think my roommate would like that idea very much.

2006
02:20:12,965 --> 02:20:13,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I know my wife didn't.

2007
02:20:13,946 --> 02:20:17,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, except I'm not married to the roommate.

2008
02:20:17,128 --> 02:20:18,549
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more of a business arrangement.

2009
02:20:18,589 --> 02:20:19,289
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little different.

2010
02:20:19,969 --> 02:20:20,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, I'm sorry.

2011
02:20:20,810 --> 02:20:22,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to think of my marriage that way, too.

2012
02:20:23,692 --> 02:20:25,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, that's all marriage was, was a business agreement.

2013
02:20:26,033 --> 02:20:28,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, GS68, is there anything we're getting on tangent?

2014
02:20:28,475 --> 02:20:30,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything else you want to add about your wonderful weekend?

2015
02:20:31,907 --> 02:20:37,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but mostly I was playing The Grid, which is like this third-person shooter.

2016
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:39,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I know The Grid.

2017
02:20:39,971 --> 02:20:41,051
[SPEAKER_09]: The Grid is awesome.

2018
02:20:41,912 --> 02:20:46,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Rush 2049, which was the racing game of Horde before one-gun Maxi.

2019
02:20:47,554 --> 02:20:49,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they ever bring The Grid out on home consoles?

2020
02:20:50,415 --> 02:20:52,036
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's on regular PlayStation, isn't it?

2021
02:20:52,436 --> 02:20:53,216
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think it is.

2022
02:20:53,477 --> 02:20:54,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's kind of weird.

2023
02:20:56,127 --> 02:20:56,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2024
02:20:57,268 --> 02:21:00,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, GS68, any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we take another call?

2025
02:21:00,451 --> 02:21:03,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo did not address restore space at E3.

2026
02:21:04,054 --> 02:21:05,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Epic fucking fail.

2027
02:21:05,936 --> 02:21:06,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Agreed.

2028
02:21:07,253 --> 02:21:08,954
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very disappointed they didn't address it.

2029
02:21:09,234 --> 02:21:25,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I hold out hope that maybe since folks at Nintendo feel that this is not where they're going to be addressing the hardcore gamers anymore, my hopes are at PAX our questions will be answered because I can't think of what other show is for the hardcore gamers except maybe Tokyo Game Show.

2030
02:21:25,265 --> 02:21:26,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for stealing my words.

2031
02:21:26,686 --> 02:21:28,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Tokyo Game Show would be the other one.

2032
02:21:28,507 --> 02:21:30,869
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't display at Tokyo Game Show though.

2033
02:21:30,929 --> 02:21:32,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally Nintendo's not there.

2034
02:21:32,290 --> 02:21:34,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but they do something concurrent.

2035
02:21:34,133 --> 02:21:36,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they do that thing concurrently.

2036
02:21:36,597 --> 02:21:37,799
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty much the same thing.

2037
02:21:40,115 --> 02:21:47,897
[SPEAKER_05]: On all our end game facts, I have a statement that says I'm not removing it until Nintendo addresses Wii Store space.

2038
02:21:48,997 --> 02:21:50,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very unfortunate they didn't.

2039
02:21:50,718 --> 02:21:53,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that little speaker system is kind of whatever.

2040
02:21:54,379 --> 02:21:58,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Just roll out a freaking patch that supports the SD cards.

2041
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:01,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it overnight while we're sleeping, you know?

2042
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:01,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do it.

2043
02:22:02,501 --> 02:22:03,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, whatever happens.

2044
02:22:03,701 --> 02:22:04,181
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 did it.

2045
02:22:04,321 --> 02:22:05,762
[SPEAKER_05]: The original Xbox did it.

2046
02:22:06,282 --> 02:22:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't...

2047
02:22:07,777 --> 02:22:10,018
[SPEAKER_05]: A console that's one generation ahead.

2048
02:22:11,419 --> 02:22:13,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, but it's the new generation, not the next generation.

2049
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:20,564
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to understand, they announced stuff that's been out on other systems forever and act like it's the newest thing ever.

2050
02:22:20,624 --> 02:22:24,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, oh my god, it's voice chat over the internet.

2051
02:22:24,326 --> 02:22:27,188
[SPEAKER_08]: This has never been done a billion times before.

2052
02:22:27,708 --> 02:22:28,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, but wait, it's different.

2053
02:22:28,809 --> 02:22:34,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a community voice chat because it's a giant microphone thing instead of headsets.

2054
02:22:35,014 --> 02:22:35,414
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

2055
02:23:01,149 --> 02:23:01,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Gold Banjo

2056
02:23:19,023 --> 02:23:21,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I never got around to that.

2057
02:23:36,219 --> 02:23:37,600
[SPEAKER_09]: That, well, you didn't miss much.

2058
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:40,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll come out until really late in the GameCube cycle.

2059
02:23:40,261 --> 02:23:43,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Fox will be the thing that we get a couple years down the road.

2060
02:23:43,323 --> 02:23:44,503
[SPEAKER_09]: But F-Zero, man.

2061
02:23:44,963 --> 02:23:50,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's just because Mario Kart is still out there, so they want Mario Kart to be the racing thing for a little while.

2062
02:23:50,906 --> 02:23:53,948
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really hope that next year's E3 we get something about F-Zero.

2063
02:23:55,097 --> 02:23:55,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, me too.

2064
02:23:56,498 --> 02:23:56,878
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2065
02:23:57,159 --> 02:23:59,000
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just a big F-Zero fan.

2066
02:23:59,420 --> 02:23:59,921
[SPEAKER_09]: What can I say?

2067
02:24:00,962 --> 02:24:03,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't mind watching somebody else kind of pick that up.

2068
02:24:03,464 --> 02:24:04,765
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Wipeout's kind of cool.

2069
02:24:04,785 --> 02:24:09,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess Wipeout's the closest thing I can think of on another system that's kind of like F-Zero, but it's not the same.

2070
02:24:09,588 --> 02:24:11,650
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love that futuristic fast racing.

2071
02:24:11,690 --> 02:24:13,552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my favorite, is the future fast.

2072
02:24:13,972 --> 02:24:14,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Speed Racer.

2073
02:24:15,553 --> 02:24:15,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

2074
02:24:15,914 --> 02:24:16,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to check that out.

2075
02:24:16,914 --> 02:24:17,755
[SPEAKER_08]: You should check it out.

2076
02:24:17,855 --> 02:24:19,056
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually pretty cool.

2077
02:24:19,076 --> 02:24:19,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you own it?

2078
02:24:19,937 --> 02:24:20,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2079
02:24:20,297 --> 02:24:21,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to borrow it.

2080
02:24:22,594 --> 02:24:23,435
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't borrow it.

2081
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:47,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2082
02:25:11,417 --> 02:25:23,600
[SPEAKER_11]: I got my... But with the first online journey onto the online thing, there's always going to be that... The little kid that likes to swear and be rude.

2083
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:25,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it happens.

2084
02:25:25,681 --> 02:25:35,003
[SPEAKER_11]: The kid's like speaking some other language and stuff, and then once we start to try and vote ban him, then he apologizes and speaks English.

2085
02:25:35,223 --> 02:25:38,624
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm like, you know, now you can speak English.

2086
02:25:39,244 --> 02:25:43,947
[SPEAKER_11]: and it just got me so mad and stuff and then he's like swearing not to ban him.

2087
02:25:44,067 --> 02:25:44,908
[SPEAKER_11]: We just banned him.

2088
02:25:45,068 --> 02:25:46,149
[SPEAKER_11]: No questions asked.

2089
02:25:46,169 --> 02:25:48,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Good for you.

2090
02:25:48,630 --> 02:25:53,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a zero tolerance policy for idiots on those things and on Xbox Live I warn them every time.

2091
02:25:54,174 --> 02:25:55,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I do the little feedback thing every time.

2092
02:25:57,036 --> 02:25:58,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a little jerk on Xbox Live.

2093
02:25:58,657 --> 02:25:59,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a tattletale.

2094
02:25:59,797 --> 02:26:00,418
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what?

2095
02:26:01,098 --> 02:26:01,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody's got to do it.

2096
02:26:03,513 --> 02:26:04,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

2097
02:26:05,054 --> 02:26:05,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just annoying.

2098
02:26:06,454 --> 02:26:07,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2099
02:26:07,755 --> 02:26:09,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Banjo.

2100
02:26:10,436 --> 02:26:11,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me think.

2101
02:26:12,117 --> 02:26:14,318
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2102
02:26:15,179 --> 02:26:18,400
[SPEAKER_11]: E3 could have been better, but I am excited for Banjo-Kazooie 3.

2103
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:19,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't care what anybody else says.

2104
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:23,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a hardcore Banjo-Kazooie fan.

2105
02:26:23,703 --> 02:26:26,444
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had a lot of Banjo-Kazooie love on the show tonight, so there you have it.

2106
02:26:26,844 --> 02:26:54,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Gold Banjo adding a little bit of Banjo Kazooie love so it's not just a clever name Banjo Kazooie alright have a good night my friend take care I was going to say too real quick if you are interested in a game that's sort of like you know F-Zero try the Speed Racer Wii game it just dropped in price it's only $29.99 now and you probably can get it used for even cheaper I still need to play the pinball game I got on Wii I've played a little bit of it and it's fun I need to play more of it because pinball is awesome right Jamie?

2107
02:26:56,109 --> 02:26:56,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

2108
02:26:57,130 --> 02:27:01,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you don't own a Wii, you can get it on the PS2 coming in September.

2109
02:27:01,592 --> 02:27:03,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, Shaoran in chat called me a fucking narc.

2110
02:27:04,694 --> 02:27:06,595
[SPEAKER_09]: But narc was an awesome game, so shut up.

2111
02:27:07,055 --> 02:27:07,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch.

2112
02:27:08,276 --> 02:27:09,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Winners don't use drugs, Rob.

2113
02:27:09,697 --> 02:27:10,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2114
02:27:10,697 --> 02:27:11,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

2115
02:27:12,138 --> 02:27:13,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Bow down to Pyramid Head.

2116
02:27:13,599 --> 02:27:14,299
[SPEAKER_12]: No, this is Osfer.

2117
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:15,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, what's up, Osfer?

2118
02:27:17,421 --> 02:27:18,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be cool if Pyramid Head did call us.

2119
02:27:18,602 --> 02:27:25,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like I'm the only one that was kind of excited for a new Zelda game to be announced, and it was never announced, so I'm sad.

2120
02:27:26,991 --> 02:27:27,692
[SPEAKER_09]: It was Phantom Hourglass.

2121
02:27:27,752 --> 02:27:27,952
[SPEAKER_09]: It was

2122
02:27:46,482 --> 02:27:46,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2123
02:27:46,962 --> 02:27:47,623
[SPEAKER_12]: It was okay.

2124
02:27:47,783 --> 02:27:51,106
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to remember, Nintendo's developing for two major platforms now.

2125
02:27:51,146 --> 02:27:53,628
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just about the Wii, it's about the DS as well.

2126
02:27:54,028 --> 02:27:56,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, they're a little split there.

2127
02:27:56,370 --> 02:28:02,475
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think you'll see a new Zelda, you know, Uber-type looking game next year, probably.

2128
02:28:03,455 --> 02:28:10,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I was more surprised that Kid Icarus thing, with all the evidence that supported its existence, I'm very surprised that didn't show up.

2129
02:28:10,581 --> 02:28:11,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Very surprised.

2130
02:28:13,143 --> 02:28:14,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know that there's just

2131
02:28:14,656 --> 02:28:15,797
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2132
02:28:39,721 --> 02:28:40,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Donkey Kong Barrel Blast

2133
02:29:10,061 --> 02:29:13,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, the Wii Zapper and Super Mario Galaxy.

2134
02:29:13,883 --> 02:29:18,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there was anything for December, January or something.

2135
02:29:19,066 --> 02:29:21,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have room to announce some more games in there.

2136
02:29:21,588 --> 02:29:24,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think they're going to have one game for the holiday.

2137
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:27,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless they manage to get the Wii Sports Resort thing out.

2138
02:29:27,871 --> 02:29:30,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So I expect some more announcements.

2139
02:29:32,294 --> 02:29:35,136
[SPEAKER_09]: So some hopefulness from Loki that makes sense.

2140
02:29:35,296 --> 02:29:35,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes sense to me.

2141
02:29:36,036 --> 02:29:36,476
[SPEAKER_09]: He's right.

2142
02:29:36,657 --> 02:29:38,898
[SPEAKER_09]: There's got to be more than one game coming out this Christmas.

2143
02:29:41,438 --> 02:29:42,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other thoughts, Ossifer?

2144
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:51,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of concerned about the future for DDR, seeing as that they want to add mines or shock arrows, as they call it, into it.

2145
02:29:53,663 --> 02:30:03,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Eh, at least they're trying something new for them, but you're right, I don't think it's going to give the game the swift kick in the pants it needs, but it's something, I guess, to hold people over.

2146
02:30:05,127 --> 02:30:09,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I don't want DDR to turn into ITG, because that's one of the main reasons I hate in the group,

2147
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:15,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and also, even if you can turn it off, like in the group, it kicks you from being able to rank in any of the songs, so, I don't know.

2148
02:30:35,622 --> 02:30:36,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

2149
02:30:37,063 --> 02:30:37,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll see.

2150
02:30:38,383 --> 02:30:41,564
[SPEAKER_09]: I am curious about that new machine, though, when everyone comes to our neighborhood.

2151
02:30:41,604 --> 02:30:43,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it doesn't get broken by little kids first.

2152
02:30:43,585 --> 02:30:43,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2153
02:30:44,485 --> 02:30:48,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot to mention, I played Guitar Freak's V4 this week.

2154
02:30:49,407 --> 02:30:51,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to say I'm very unimpressed by it.

2155
02:30:52,168 --> 02:30:58,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I don't know, the whole interface and everything looks like a really shoddy PlayStation 2 game.

2156
02:30:59,366 --> 02:31:16,214
[SPEAKER_08]: which actually I think the releases of Guitar Freaks are on Playstation 2 so I guess it makes sense but no innovation whatsoever alright well we gotta let you go buddy we're gonna wrap up the show but have a good one okay alright see ya I'm calling to the night later

2157
02:31:18,667 --> 02:31:20,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to close the Skype line for now.

2158
02:31:20,828 --> 02:31:29,592
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't get through, I'm so sorry, but you can always leave us a voicemail, or, and I've got to catch up on voicemails, probably next week we'll do that, or you can always send us an email, mailbag, orange launch radio dot com.

2159
02:31:29,632 --> 02:31:30,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do some last minute stories.

2160
02:31:30,933 --> 02:31:31,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you said you had a couple.

2161
02:31:32,627 --> 02:31:39,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually do, and one of them, because I couldn't get the email pulled back up, I found it from another site, but this one was given to me by Rob with two Bs.

2162
02:31:41,533 --> 02:31:47,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Time Hollow, which is a Konami game for the DS, is to be localized and released in August.

2163
02:31:49,539 --> 02:31:58,344
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually, the neat thing about the game is that you get this thing called a time pen, which is your stylus, that you use to manipulate time to solve puzzles within the game.

2164
02:31:58,384 --> 02:32:01,747
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, almost sort of Phoenix Wright-ish.

2165
02:32:02,967 --> 02:32:15,795
[SPEAKER_01]: and in terms of how it feels or how it plays but you can check either the Japanese website for it which is konami.jp slash time underscore hollow or I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube.

2166
02:32:16,914 --> 02:32:44,575
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other thing that's I know a few other anime fans would be excited about this is that Sega grabbed the license for the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya for Nintendo DS actually several of the DS games from Namco Bandai and Sega's like okay we want so you might see those eventually and you can also get the little happy dance that she does oh the Playstation 2 one

2167
02:32:46,990 --> 02:32:50,431
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Playstation 2 when she apparently makes her own RPG and then you get to play it.

2168
02:32:52,572 --> 02:32:53,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

2169
02:32:55,113 --> 02:32:55,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.

2170
02:32:56,754 --> 02:32:57,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything?

2171
02:32:57,774 --> 02:32:58,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course I have stuff.

2172
02:32:58,995 --> 02:33:00,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a long laundry list of stuff.

2173
02:33:01,215 --> 02:33:01,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Make it quick.

2174
02:33:01,956 --> 02:33:02,636
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to go home.

2175
02:33:04,242 --> 02:33:14,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, anyways, Ubisoft announced a game called I Am Alive, it's like a survival game, looks pretty cool, coming out Spring 2009, and, uh, yeah, I had an awesome trailer for that.

2176
02:33:14,925 --> 02:33:28,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band 2, they announced the full track list for the game, which is pretty awesome, including, uh, there's ACDC, AFI, Lance Morissette, um, Alice in Chains, Bad Company, Beastie Boys, Billy Idol, um...

2177
02:33:29,244 --> 02:33:29,965
[SPEAKER_08]: There is Journey.

2178
02:33:31,126 --> 02:33:33,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much one of those rumored lists came true.

2179
02:33:33,468 --> 02:33:35,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, etc.

2180
02:33:35,830 --> 02:33:36,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Fleetwood Mac, awesome.

2181
02:33:37,251 --> 02:33:40,154
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is 84 songs that they detailed.

2182
02:33:40,374 --> 02:33:44,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear there's going to be 20 more tracks as well, but they're going to be free downloads.

2183
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:47,004
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2184
02:34:06,215 --> 02:34:12,419
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rockman instruments will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour.

2185
02:34:13,079 --> 02:34:14,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So you will actually be able to use them.

2186
02:34:14,860 --> 02:34:20,503
[SPEAKER_08]: What they're going to do, since Guitar Hero World Tour has five things you can hit instead of...

2187
02:34:21,564 --> 02:34:22,844
[SPEAKER_08]: XBOX 360 Guitar Hero Aerosmith

2188
02:34:44,016 --> 02:34:47,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, apparently NCAA Football 09 is really broken.

2189
02:34:48,518 --> 02:35:04,144
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a laundry list of stuff that's just not working, including some sliders, like the CPU sliders don't do anything, the online Dynasty mode's broken, the Super Sim mode is broken, and kick returns are also broken, and some other crap.

2190
02:35:04,204 --> 02:35:05,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So, way to go, EA Sports.

2191
02:35:05,984 --> 02:35:08,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I want to see NASCAR 09.

2192
02:35:08,785 --> 02:35:10,006
[SPEAKER_08]: The game saves are broken.

2193
02:35:10,726 --> 02:35:10,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.

2194
02:35:12,030 --> 02:35:17,767
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that's kind of interesting is apparently Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had...

2195
02:35:19,088 --> 02:35:19,268
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2196
02:35:19,308 --> 02:35:19,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

2197
02:35:19,629 --> 02:35:20,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2198
02:35:20,709 --> 02:35:20,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2199
02:35:46,013 --> 02:35:55,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the NPD results for June have come out, and the Wii is now the number one selling system in the US, as well as the world now.

2200
02:35:56,137 --> 02:36:03,699
[SPEAKER_08]: So, 10.9 million units with the Xbox 360 trailing behind by just a little bit.

2201
02:36:04,019 --> 02:36:05,580
[SPEAKER_08]: So, very interesting.

2202
02:36:07,060 --> 02:36:08,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2203
02:36:24,807 --> 02:36:28,154
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also rumors that Nintendo might actually be publishing that title.

2204
02:36:28,314 --> 02:36:29,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic and Mario World.

2205
02:36:29,477 --> 02:36:30,158
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome.

2206
02:36:30,178 --> 02:36:31,661
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be kind of interesting there.

2207
02:36:32,944 --> 02:36:36,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Miyamoto announced that they're making a Pikmin game.

2208
02:36:37,324 --> 02:36:40,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Rhythm Heaven Rhythm Tengoku Gold

2209
02:36:55,324 --> 02:37:00,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Samba de Amigo, Sega has confirmed that it will be getting download content.

2210
02:37:01,588 --> 02:37:10,352
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually going to debut some launch content starting on September 23rd when the game is launched.

2211
02:37:10,753 --> 02:37:16,676
[SPEAKER_08]: The first set of downloads will include the 80s radio song I Want Candy from Bow Wow Wow.

2212
02:37:17,476 --> 02:37:18,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Bow Wow Wow.

2213
02:37:18,956 --> 02:37:19,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, wow.

2214
02:37:19,456 --> 02:37:20,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we get it.

2215
02:37:20,296 --> 02:37:20,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Too many.

2216
02:37:21,437 --> 02:37:24,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Jets, Are You Going to Be My Girl?

2217
02:37:25,378 --> 02:37:27,338
[SPEAKER_08]: and Lou Bega's Mambo Mambo.

2218
02:37:28,418 --> 02:37:34,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And no word if those are pay-to-unlock content or if it's actually download content, but interesting nonetheless.

2219
02:37:35,860 --> 02:37:38,261
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see here.

2220
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:45,745
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a new unlock code for Supernova 2 cabinets that revealed three more songs.

2221
02:37:46,005 --> 02:37:55,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Terra Stars, Jet Girl Spins, Mars Wars 3, and Revenge G Alternative with Reba.

2222
02:37:57,233 --> 02:37:59,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Rebata, or however you pronounce that.

2223
02:37:59,615 --> 02:38:01,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, Paranoid Hades.

2224
02:38:02,157 --> 02:38:02,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cool.

2225
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:05,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see here.

2226
02:38:06,901 --> 02:38:07,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick...

2227
02:38:10,523 --> 02:38:12,325
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of last minute stories.

2228
02:38:12,385 --> 02:38:12,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, sorry.

2229
02:38:12,825 --> 02:38:14,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to be quick.

2230
02:38:16,589 --> 02:38:19,212
[SPEAKER_08]: GPS coming to the PSP within nine months.

2231
02:38:19,893 --> 02:38:25,419
[SPEAKER_08]: They're releasing some Famicom inspired classic controllers, so you can import those if you want them.

2232
02:38:26,480 --> 02:38:26,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2233
02:38:28,206 --> 02:38:32,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here... Well, it was E3 week, so it was a little busy this week.

2234
02:38:33,108 --> 02:38:34,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun little bit of trivia.

2235
02:38:35,029 --> 02:38:47,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing, which was being shown off at E3, actually had, of course, none other than Charles Martinet playing the game as well from an undisclosed location with a Mario-style avatar.

2236
02:38:47,775 --> 02:38:53,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was riffing people in the Mario voice and was also hitting people with axes and complaining about people that ran over his flowers.

2237
02:38:53,958 --> 02:38:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking undisclosed location means backstage, because...

2238
02:38:58,140 --> 02:39:06,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you remember when they showed off the whole voice chat or the DS internet thing, but they had Charles Martinet in Seattle, right?

2239
02:39:06,908 --> 02:39:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that?

2240
02:39:07,789 --> 02:39:10,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you would see him like an hour later walking around the show floor.

2241
02:39:10,852 --> 02:39:12,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because he could teleport.

2242
02:39:13,655 --> 02:39:18,579
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a rumor that someone is working on a PSP emulator for the Wii and they have screenshots.

2243
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:23,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, right now it's only running at about 7 frames per second, but that's still disturbing nonetheless.

2244
02:39:23,684 --> 02:39:30,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Animal Crossing will support USB keyboards so you can actually type your messages to people without having to use the Wii remote because that sucked.

2245
02:39:30,988 --> 02:39:35,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Gears of War 2 is coming out November 7th this year so people are probably excited about that.

2246
02:39:36,151 --> 02:39:40,953
[SPEAKER_08]: LittleBigPlanet is going to allow you to charge users for your content that you created.

2247
02:39:41,013 --> 02:39:41,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh god.

2248
02:39:43,442 --> 02:39:44,042
[SPEAKER_08]: DKS3713 Final Fantasy VII

2249
02:40:00,848 --> 02:40:04,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock Band 2 is going to be... The release of this is really strange.

2250
02:40:05,091 --> 02:40:08,413
[SPEAKER_08]: The game-only version for the Xbox 360 is coming out in September.

2251
02:40:09,054 --> 02:40:14,878
[SPEAKER_08]: The bundle, as long as with the PS3 bundle, the PS3 standalone version is coming out in October.

2252
02:40:15,418 --> 02:40:16,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Wii...

2253
02:40:17,475 --> 02:40:20,177
[SPEAKER_08]: and PlayStation 2 versions I think are coming out in November.

2254
02:40:21,138 --> 02:40:24,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that confusing enough?

2255
02:40:25,821 --> 02:40:27,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And then let's see here.

2256
02:40:27,902 --> 02:40:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my favorite thing, which I'm going to end on here real quick, is that there's a quote taken from G4, apparently it was an interview with Reggie Fils-Aimé, who says, How could you feel left out?

2257
02:40:41,492 --> 02:40:44,333
[SPEAKER_08]: The Animal Crossing that we've been hearing about that people wanted...

2258
02:40:45,786 --> 02:40:54,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Fully connected to the internet, go to other people's towns, plus I said Grand Theft Auto on the DS, how do you feel left out with those types of announcements?

2259
02:40:54,994 --> 02:40:56,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's quite easy.

2260
02:40:59,277 --> 02:41:03,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's about 500 other things you didn't address, but maybe it's just me.

2261
02:41:04,402 --> 02:41:05,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a casual gamer, what do I know?

2262
02:41:06,804 --> 02:41:09,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thank you for the follow-up updates.

2263
02:41:09,405 --> 02:41:11,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Although quite lengthy, it was E3 week.

2264
02:41:11,165 --> 02:41:12,286
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of shit going on.

2265
02:41:12,706 --> 02:41:19,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week, I'm sure we'll have a lot of stuff too as the fallout begins from E3 and we start ramping up towards Christmas, as was said earlier.

2266
02:41:19,588 --> 02:41:22,848
[SPEAKER_09]: But for now, we go around and we get everybody's final thought.

2267
02:41:23,249 --> 02:41:24,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2268
02:41:25,209 --> 02:41:40,477
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is, this is actually kind of funny, there's apparently Dead Rising, the Wii version is being called Dead Rising Zombie Sacrifice in Japan, and I don't know if this is true, but for the US version, I heard that they're calling it Dead Rising Chop Until You Drop.

2269
02:41:41,437 --> 02:41:42,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Cheesy.

2270
02:41:42,578 --> 02:41:43,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

2271
02:41:43,919 --> 02:41:46,280
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is, I kind of want a burrito.

2272
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,561
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2273
02:41:50,302 --> 02:41:50,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh...

2274
02:41:51,661 --> 02:41:55,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh, we might have to chop till we drop DarkSakura.

2275
02:41:55,056 --> 02:41:56,483
[SPEAKER_09]: She sounds like she's turning into a zombie.

2276
02:41:57,639 --> 02:42:26,481

[SPEAKER_01]: Do not want.

2278
02:42:29,776 --> 02:42:31,600
[SPEAKER_09]: That might make a headache worse, won't it?

2279
02:42:32,402 --> 02:42:33,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a very bad headache right now.
