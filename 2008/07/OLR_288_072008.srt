00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,480
Tonight July 20th, 2008, at E3, Microsoft announces a Netflix partnership, Sony is set

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,760
to launch a new MAG game, and Nintendo announces a Grand Theft Auto portable game.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Radio.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,360
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
lifestyle.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,080
But we're not cool enough for E3, I'm sorry to say.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,400
No, we just sat here bitter all week long eating our bon-bons and watching it on TV.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Right, DarkSakura?

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
My lovely coast?

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Hell no.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Hell no?

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I did other stuff.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Like what?

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Going outside?

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
What's that?

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,160
Going to the Classic Gaming Expo, not Classic Gaming Expo, what the hell am I saying?

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,560
California Xtreme.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,800
You were thinking about going to Classic Gaming Expo, but you actually went to California

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,800
Xtreme.

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,960
Classic Gaming Expo is dead as far as I know, so.

23
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,800
I think they're supposed to have it again next year, I'm not sure.

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,360
I try to keep tabs on MySpace, but we'll see.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,880
But we'll get more on California Xtreme in just a minute, but it would not be a show

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,160
if I could not introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Hello.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
How you doing, Loki?

29
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,160
I'm doing okay.

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
All right.

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,720
Did you, now you did not go to California Xtreme.

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,320
No, I did not go to California Xtreme.

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,240
What did you do in lieu of E3 this year?

34
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,120
I actually watched E3, watched the press conferences streaming, during work, I might add, because

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,280
it technically is work-related, so we sat.

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,400
All right, you sell the games, so it's kind of work-related for you.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,160
Yeah, so we, well, yeah, I tried getting that past management.

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,120
Luckily, management wasn't there, so we watched it anyways.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Nice.

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
Yeah, so it was interesting.

41
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
All right.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,040
I ended up reading it through blogs, because I, my day job, I teach, not kids, but adults.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,240
I teach in a corporate environment, and so I didn't really have a chance to watch anything

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,760
live, so I just had to kind of read it through blogs, but, you know, people had it covered,

45
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,800
I guess, although it would have been more exciting to be there, but, you know, what

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
can you do?

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
You can go to a different expo, that's what you can do, and we'll talk more about that

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
in a little while, but first, let's hear about the trip that Jamie took this week, which

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
I'm surprised.

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,000
Somebody would do a gaming expo the same week as E3, but you went on a little trip,

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
right?

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,920
I went on a little trip today for Saturday, I didn't, you know, it ended today, but I

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,560
ran into lots of people that I know, including someone in our chat room right now, GS68,

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
who actually found me.

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,840
Nice hat, by the way.

57
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,000
And I ran into Mel and Melody, I ran into Wendell and some of his buddies, and saw a

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,040
few other notable personages.

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,640
I actually saw Jason Enos in line.

60
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,800
GS68 has actually posted his share of pictures from the event on his little photo bucket

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,880
in our chat room, chat.orangelandsradio.com, and what's this I see here, I think this might

62
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
be a picture.

63
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,880
Ah, yes, there is Dark Sockar, our very own little space invader.

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,880
How do you get a space invader?

65
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Nice.

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,880
Melody and I wanted to steal it.

67
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,280
And some other lady with her ass on the table, right next to you.

68
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,520
You might want to crop that picture, GS68, it's very unflattering to the other lady

69
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,160
who looks like she just pooped out a playing card.

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Let me link the chat.

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm sorry, podcast listeners, because you're thinking like, what?

72
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,440
But I have to post this picture because I'm laughing too hard at it.

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
I look like hell.

74
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,520
Oh, you look fine.

75
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Like hell.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
Look, you don't look nearly as bad as the other lady.

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,880
All right, enough about- She did poop a playing card.

78
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,800
Look, what kind of games did you get to play at California Extreme?

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,480
Okay, let me grab the phone because I took pictures of everything.

80
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,880
You pay a cover fee, right, to get into this thing, and then you just play three arcade

81
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,320
games from the 80s and 90s all day long, right?

82
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,080
And a few more recent ones.

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,600
I got an email with- Dude, there's a spider again!

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,760
I got an email with a Journey arcade game picture, so I know you played that at least.

85
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,040
I didn't play it, Melody did.

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,520
It made part of my soul hurt.

87
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Why?

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,840
Because I cried, you know, from nostalgia.

89
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,320
Did she get the- She finally got the concert tried toward the

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
end of the day.

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,080
I was gonna say, you have to get the tape to play.

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
That's the best part.

93
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Okay, so, games.

94
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,240
I've got a list of stuff I did and did not play.

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,000
First of all, they had a demo of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix set up, and they

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,840
had a PlayStation 3 set up with the online games, including Puzzle Fighter HD, which

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,280
I watched Wendell and Mel play.

98
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,800
Melody and I played Raiden Fighters 2, which was pretty fucking sweet, and I got fifth

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,920
highest score.

100
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,760
They had the prop cycle Addams Family there.

101
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
What?

102
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,720
You know the people that have the prop cycle set up to play Addams Family?

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,040
No, I haven't seen that.

104
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
Oh, you have, too, because we commented on it.

105
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Really?

106
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,200
I've seen the prop cycle, but I've never seen it.

107
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Let me see.

108
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Don't drop my phone.

109
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I won't.

110
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Oh, that is kind of strange.

111
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,880
Is actually someone on a prop cycle- A prop cycle attached to an Addams Family,

112
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,400
and the game runs as you pedal.

113
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Huh.

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Interesting.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I've had pictures of this set before, so moving on- Oh, that's- My phone's upside down, Rob.

116
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Come on.

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,880
Turn back right side up.

118
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Thank you.

119
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,200
Sorry, I had to fix my phone.

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Silly iPhone.

121
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,520
Melody played Star Wars Racer Arcade that they had put inside one of these games that

122
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,120
you look into the view hole to do the racing, and I think it was like a submarine or space

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,240
game before or something, but it was kind of neat.

124
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,240
They had blasteroids there, which I didn't play, and I was so mad because I took a picture

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,440
of a guy in a Big Bang bar shirt, but the picture didn't come out well, and then they

126
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,640
had one of those mini SNK cabinets.

127
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:15,160
Like there's, if you can see, we had to play on our knees to play it, and we played Puzzle

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,760
Bobble, and Melody and I played a sit-down of Crystal Castles, the two-player sit-downs.

129
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Oh, cool.

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Like one with a cocktail, yeah.

131
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,560
You set your drink on it.

132
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,560
And then I didn't- Oh, yeah, this is a picture of some dude playing Journey, so-

133
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
So is it just arcade game madness or what?

134
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
They have these little panels and stuff there, too, right?

135
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
Yeah, panels.

136
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,520
Dan went to the panel that had Steve Ritchie, who's the guy who designed some of the best

137
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,260
pins ever, like Twilight Zone and No Fear.

138
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,160
We actually have a lot of the games that he designed.

139
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,040
By the way, they did have Tapper, but I didn't play.

140
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Awesome.

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,320
But they, he went to that panel, and then I went to a panel later on with Dan to see

142
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,240
someone talk about customizing.

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm trying to be understanding because it was his first panel, it just wasn't very well

144
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
presented.

145
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,400
I think, you know, with a little bit of experience, he can do better, but there were some interesting

146
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
things.

147
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,400
And then we went to a panel about the guy who made Donkey Kong 2, as in he sprite-ripped

148
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,240
and redid levels to have going after the original four in Donkey Kong.

149
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Because I was going to say, wait, Donkey Kong 2 is Donkey Kong Jr., but this is a different

150
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
thing.

151
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
This is an actual Donkey Kong 2.

152
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Interesting.

153
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,000
Um, you can find the, he actually has a website and everything, but, and then I went to watch

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,760
Tilt, but I only watched the first part of it because I've seen the rest of it, but it's

155
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,360
like about the end of Williams Pinball Division and the Pinball 2000 that came out.

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,480
I did play some Episode 1 Pinball.

157
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Cool, cool.

158
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,440
But for other games, I had a Gallagher game.

159
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Like the guy who smashes watermelons, Gallagher?

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Yes.

161
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,480
And it's like one of those little gun games like Mad Dog McCree was.

162
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Nice.

163
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,280
And, um, do you shoot watermelons and they explode?

164
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
No.

165
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,440
Maybe you can shoot flies off of his, off of a lunch.

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,600
And I played a sit-down Cinestar.

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
That's cool.

168
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Very cool.

169
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Beware.

170
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I live.

171
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Yeah.

172
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
There was a Burger Time and I played some Gauntlet.

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,840
Uh, Junior Pac-Man, uh, Melody played that.

174
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,040
So you played it all.

175
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,600
I mean, there's some, some, some notable, there's a picture of my foot.

176
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,560
Um, I also, um, they had a Big Bang bar, which of course, you know, I had to play Big Bang

177
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
bar.

178
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
It's a chain, right?

179
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,080
And then, um, Oh, there's my beer.

180
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,320
I also played, um, an eight ball deluxe, which is the set, I think as far, if I'm right,

181
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,640
it's the second highest, um, grossing, um, flipper using pinball table.

182
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,520
The first being Adam's family.

183
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,040
And then I played the Ted Nugent pinball, which was actually really good.

184
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
I didn't even know that existed.

185
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,640
Gallagher 98 Pac-Mania, Monopoly, Pango, they're the Pango in a really good condition.

186
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
I love Pango.

187
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,600
It's a good, pretty Tron.

188
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,720
Um, how many people were there tons, there was just a lot of people.

189
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,160
Um, although I honestly don't know that the turnout this year was as good as last they

190
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
didn't have the auction.

191
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,880
Do you think it might have to do with the fact they're holding at the same time as E3

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
too?

193
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,400
I don't think that was really their choice because from what I understand, they were

194
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
trying to avoid scheduling around the jazz festival in San Jose.

195
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,720
Now this one's a cool one.

196
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,880
If you can see, it's a black Spiderman pinball machine.

197
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,800
They only made, I think 500 of them.

198
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,320
So someone brought it in and if you hit the right flipper button, you can play it in Spanish.

199
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,280
And then there's this guy here who had a Flynn's t-shirt on, which if anyone is a big Tron

200
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,640
nut like me, you know that that's the name of the arcade that, um, the guy had in.

201
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,840
And then this was really cool.

202
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,880
Um, someone took, um, the wizard pinball table, which was the one that Elton John was playing

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,520
in, um, in, uh, Tommy and made the big boots and put it up on a stand to play on, like

204
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
in Tommy.

205
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
All right.

206
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,360
I have to address this because Bobby's saying this in our chat room, chat that orange lounge

207
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,880
radio.com and our old buddy, Bobby black Wolf, who's on before us and all games.com.

208
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,520
He says it wasn't the same time as E3, E3 ended Thursday.

209
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,600
If anything, it made it easier for someone to attend it.

210
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
It just, they could just hop up after E3.

211
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,080
But I'm thinking like, okay, I've been to E3 in the past, granted it was a lot different

212
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
back then.

213
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,640
I know how I felt at the end of E3.

214
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,280
I didn't want to do shit.

215
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,720
The idea of another gaming expo was like the furthest thing from my mind.

216
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,600
If somebody had told me, Hey, let's go to a gaming expo tomorrow, it would be like,

217
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,840
you've got to be kidding me.

218
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,520
So I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too close

219
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
together.

220
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
You got to give it at least a month.

221
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,080
Uh, it would have been really tight and I just have to say the one day of me going,

222
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,560
um, all granted, I didn't have, um, my, the medication that I have to take, but, um, I,

223
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,720
I got so tired just walking around and, um, cause we, we left the house at, at, uh, at

224
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,680
10 and we got there just a little bit afternoon, um, actually closer to one.

225
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,520
So Dan could hit, hit that panel he wanted to go to.

226
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:10,320
Um, but just walking around all day, just all day walking and I was pretty much dead

227
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
tired.

228
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,480
I did nothing but sleep today.

229
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,800
You better prepare yourself for packs.

230
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,160
That's going to be three days.

231
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,640
I'm going to bring better shoes.

232
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
All right.

233
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Oh my God.

234
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Shoes.

235
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
All right.

236
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Oh my God.

237
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Shoes.

238
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Thank you for the lovely report.

239
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm sure we'll hear more from Dan later.

240
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Possibly.

241
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
Um, well no.

242
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,640
All right.

243
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
But go to our forum.

244
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Um, in our, um, our orange lounge chat area, I did post up a, uh, the review that Dan wrote

245
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,040
for us since we have nowhere on the front page to do it yet yet.

246
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,440
All right.

247
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,600
Um, but Dan, Dan wrote a lengthy review.

248
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,040
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week while you weren't attending any cool expos like the

249
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
cool kids?

250
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,840
Um, it was okay.

251
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,400
Like um, all right.

252
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,200
So I played the Tales of Vesperia demo, which was released this week.

253
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Very pitiful.

254
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,160
I might say that they only released two demos during their bringing it home.

255
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Oh yeah.

256
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
You brought it home.

257
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
All right.

258
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Woo wee.

259
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm not as enthusiastic as the rest of the event went.

260
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,800
Um, Tales of Vesperia.

261
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,100
I didn't like it.

262
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,600
I really wanted to like it.

263
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,400
I already had it preordered, you know, it looked like a game I could probably get into

264
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,720
kind of like, you know, eternal Sonata or something like that.

265
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,520
I just, what did it for me is I didn't like really the, I thought it was a little cheesy

266
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,260
and I mean the graphics are awesome.

267
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,560
The graphics are just like eternal Sonata.

268
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Yeah.

269
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Combat was kind of annoying.

270
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,560
I didn't like the combat one bit that kind of ruined it for me.

271
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,720
Um, it's all kind of real time and you switch between your characters and you cast spells

272
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,360
and stuff and everyone kind of is on autopilot, which kind of sucked.

273
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,840
Um, I liked eternal Sonata a lot better where it was turn based and you could do all that

274
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
real time stuff within like a certain time limit.

275
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,680
I thought that was pretty cool, but this was kind of all over the place.

276
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,240
And um, then my buddy played Too Human.

277
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,840
I didn't get a chance to play it because I tried downloading the demo twice, both times

278
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,220
it was corrupted.

279
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,040
So that was awesome.

280
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,080
And here it was just mediocre.

281
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,160
So I don't know, but he's going to buy it because he liked, you know, games like Conan

282
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,120
and stuff like that, which, you know, I kind of like that too.

283
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,200
It doesn't really take much to impress me as far as action games go.

284
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400
I mean, I don't know.

285
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,160
But um, I did play some DS games, I played Metal Slug 7 a bit and I didn't really play

286
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,780
the main game of it because I mean, shit, it's just Metal Slug.

287
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,120
But they had these like challenge mode things in there and that was kind of interesting.

288
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,480
You had different tasks and once you finish those, you go up in rank and stuff like that

289
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
and it gets harder.

290
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,080
So that, that's kind of cool with the added replayability.

291
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,900
And then I played, um, more point blank DS, which the DS, I don't know.

292
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,040
At first it was pretty fun with the DS stylus, but it's just not as accurate as firing the

293
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,340
gun.

294
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,640
So it's kind of frustrating at times because you're tapping.

295
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,120
That's strange because I would think when you tap, you're tapping right on it, whereas

296
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
exactly button.

297
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,440
But sometimes the, I don't know if they had a calibration option or whatever, but it wasn't

298
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,800
exact.

299
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,960
So that was kind of annoying.

300
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,520
And um, what else did I play?

301
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,800
I tried some more of a portal still live, which was that DS, or actually it's still

302
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,200
live DS, I guess, which is that little, uh, like portal game, the 2D one.

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,320
That was kind of fun, short.

304
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,080
Um, and what else did I play?

305
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,560
I think that was pretty much it.

306
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
I was just kind of going all over the place.

307
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, I went back to play some old Xbox live arcade games, played Zuma some more, because

308
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
that's fun.

309
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Nelly's cool.

310
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,320
Because now that I have it hooked up to the TV again, Nelly's like, oh, Zuma, I can play

311
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
this again.

312
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
So.

313
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
All right.

314
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,160
Sounds, sounds like you were keeping yourself busy with what you already have, games you

315
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
already have to beat.

316
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Exactly.

317
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,920
And it's just like looking at, you know, there was stuff that came out this week, you know,

318
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,840
Xbox live arcade stuff, but just like, all of it sucked.

319
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,720
And uh, ooh, Tuesday, this Tuesday, my DS, I gotta dust it off with what's coming out

320
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
this Tuesday.

321
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,160
I'll tell you later in the show when we get to release dates.

322
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,520
However, uh, my gaming week, I'll keep it short, um, because there really wasn't a lot

323
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
to it.

324
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,400
It was the same stuff I've been playing, Civ Rev, uh, Space Invaders stream on PSP, but

325
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,240
I had a little bit of renaissance as well.

326
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,320
I, uh, when I saw Nintendo's press conference and, and some of the games they were debuting,

327
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,740
I was like, wow, this looks pretty much the same as, as GameCube stuff.

328
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:42,040
So I went back to the GameCube and I decided I wanted to play Animal Crossing again.

329
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,040
So I started a brand new town in Animal Crossing and started from the top.

330
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,360
And um, it's so funny.

331
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,760
I think my roommate, uh, summed it up perfectly.

332
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,120
He walked in on me playing the game this morning after I'd played it a little bit yesterday.

333
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,200
He's like, what's the point of this game?

334
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
He's kind of like, why do you like this game?

335
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,640
It seems like there's no point.

336
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,360
And I'm like, you're kind of right.

337
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,760
There is no point.

338
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,760
That's the point.

339
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,040
It's like the Sims.

340
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,880
There's no real point to that either.

341
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,800
But I thought I would, uh, play it to try and collect more of the NES games.

342
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,840
Cause remember that was one awesome thing about Animal Crossing on the GameCube is that

343
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,080
it had all the old school NES games buried in it.

344
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,960
Like you could get like Clu Clu Land.

345
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,200
How awesome is that?

346
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,920
And Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

347
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
Neither of those games on Virtual Console if I remember right.

348
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,400
So there you have it.

349
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,160
Um, and then I also, I'll tell you what, cause I was talking about it last week.

350
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
I made good on this.

351
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,640
I started playing F-Zero GX on the GameCube again cause that is a great racing game.

352
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,300
Boy I wish they would make a high def version of that cause that would be a lot of fun.

353
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,640
The cool thing is the GameCube version supports widescreen and progressive scan.

354
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,560
So it's already outputting, you know, pretty much the same level that other Wii games would.

355
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,680
You know, granted the slightly more advanced Wii hardware would probably make a better

356
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,680
F-Zero game.

357
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,360
But I want to see something like F-Zero on like 720, 1080 level.

358
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,080
That would be awesome.

359
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,440
Was that like F-Zero?

360
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,920
That's a fun racing game.

361
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,400
And I was a little sad they didn't announce that, a new F-Zero game at their press conference.

362
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,440
But what can you do?

363
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:14,080
But you have to understand the E3 wasn't for the core gamer, uh, for at least Nintendo.

364
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,320
So all the stuff that they announced was casual stuff, right?

365
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Uh, GameGuru in chat, chat.org.com does correct me and says Donkey Kong Junior Math is on

366
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,120
the Virtual Console, but it's not worth $5.

367
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
Correct.

368
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,800
It's not worth $5 considering you can get an Animal Crossing for free, there you have

369
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
it.

370
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,480
So, alright, um, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping.

371
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,040
Uh, this week as we announced at our own E3 press conference last week, you will get one

372
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,440
big show, hopefully everything on the technical end works, but you will get one big show.

373
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,760
There will no longer be part A and B, so the podcast feed might look a little different

374
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,320
because of that, but that'll be pretty cool.

375
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
And that's it.

376
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,480
Otherwise, continue to support us by giving us positive reviews on iTunes, we always appreciate

377
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
that.

378
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
There's been a few new ones that have popped up lately, some nice, very nice five star

379
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
reviews.

380
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,160
In fact, right now, if I checked correctly, we have exactly 69 reviews on iTunes right

381
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,760
now, which is a great number to be at.

382
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,760
So thank you very much.

383
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,520
Make some more, as nice as the 69 number is.

384
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
So don't forget that.

385
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Also, our LiveJournal community, we are at community Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, so

386
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
look us up there.

387
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,120
Facebook, OL Army, on Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio, so we are your social networking BFFs

388
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,040
on any of those sites you want to be our buds on.

389
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

390
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This week a little different, um, because we had E3 happen this week, nothing but press

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,320
conference stuff in this, uh, half of the show.

392
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
We're going to talk about kind of the big three press conferences, and our thoughts

393
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
on it.

394
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,340
Since I'm assuming a lot of you have probably already heard the news, let's try to dissect

395
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,340
it a little bit tonight.

396
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,560
Loke, you want to start us off.

397
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,480
Okay, so of course the big last minute thing that they did for the Xbox, um, or Microsoft

398
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,200
conference was announcing that Final Fantasy 13 would be coming to the Xbox 360 day and

399
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,600
date in the US, which, you know, is a big, you know, blow to PS3's exclusive, uh, content.

400
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,160
In fact, if I remember correctly, I believe the three games that they wanted, uh, to break

401
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,280
exclusivity on was Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy 13, and Metal Gear Solid 4.

402
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,680
Well, two out of three ain't bad, so, um, yeah, that's a pretty big thing, I think.

403
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,760
Um, it is not going to be coming, it's not exclusive in, or not coming to, uh, the Xbox

404
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,120
360 in Japan, though.

405
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Interesting.

406
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,560
But in the, um, US, it will be coming out day and date, so.

407
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,400
Which really kind of shows that this whole move is motivated nothing by but sales, basically

408
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,560
that they feel they have a better chance of penetrating the marketplace.

409
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,880
I think so, yeah.

410
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Very interesting.

411
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,920
But I, my curiosity is how long is this, is it going to make this game be out?

412
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,720
I mean, like, how far do we have to wait for this game?

413
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Because they admitted, they haven't even really started developing this game for the 360.

414
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,240
I mean, they've been doing it on some type of PC design, like what do they call it, Crystal

415
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
or something?

416
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,080
They do it on, you know, it's probably their own design platform.

417
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,680
Sure, I mean, I think here's the thing, it's not really going to be an issue with storage,

418
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,520
it's not going to be a problem, you know, getting it, obviously it's not going to be

419
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,200
on one disc, but that's fine.

420
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,760
Um, I think it's actually not going to hold them up too much because it's a lot easier

421
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,240
to develop for the 360 than it is for the PS3, and I know that Square Enix has a lot

422
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:32,160
more, um, experience developing for the 360 right now, rather than the PS3, so.

423
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,080
I don't think it's really going to hold it up any more than localizing it would.

424
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,480
Uh, Maysatsuma in chat asked the question that I've been actually getting asked a lot

425
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,200
this week because I've been pretty open on this show that I have, I had no plans to get

426
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,240
a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy 13 came out, so now this is a, you know, a question

427
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,720
I've been getting a lot this week, as I'm sure a lot of people like me have.

428
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,320
Uh, Maysatsuma says, will you have a PS, I'm sorry, will you buy a PS3 now?

429
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,040
You always said you'll buy a PS3 when Final Fantasy 13 comes out.

430
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,000
Um, not for this, now, I don't need to.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,160
The question is, will Sony be able to land other exclusives, Kingdom, that I am interested

432
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,120
in, like Kingdom Hearts 3, possibly Final Fantasy 13 versus whatever else is coming

433
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
out that I haven't thought of yet.

434
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,840
I imagine eventually I'm going to want that Blu-ray player, just because that's where

435
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,840
the video place is, and, you know, I'm one of those people that, well, as long as I'm

436
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,240
going to get a Blu-ray player, but I see no need to run out and buy one now.

437
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,960
It's, in fact, if I had ran out and bought one, and a lot of people are feeling this

438
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,120
thing, if I had ran out and bought one for Final Fantasy 13 before, I would be hurting

439
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
right now.

440
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,600
I would be hurting, not only was, you know, is Sony likely to come down in price on those

441
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,120
systems later, and we'll hear more about that later, I'm sure, but, you know.

442
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,080
Well, the thing I think also, too, you have to look at is, from the publisher's standpoint,

443
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,360
when they put this game out, and it's not even necessarily this game, because I'm thinking

444
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,720
Last Remnant's going to be out way before this, I mean, when that comes out, they're

445
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,760
going to look at the sales of that game on both consoles, and, if it's anything like

446
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,920
Grand Theft Auto IV was, it's going to be a lot more on the 360 than it is on the PS3.

447
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,040
Now, that may not be the case, obviously it's not going to be the case in Japan, but they

448
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,800
have to look at each market separately, and kind of base their decisions on that, because

449
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,960
if they were just to base it all on, you know, the Japanese market, then we wouldn't be getting

450
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,040
anything on the 360.

451
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,880
I got two questions, first is for Jamie, because I haven't heard anything yet, and I know you

452
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,880
like Final Fantasy like the rest of us, what was your reaction to the news?

453
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,640
I really didn't care.

454
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Right.

455
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,200
I have both systems.

456
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,720
That leads into my next question, that you and Loki own both systems, knowing that Final

457
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Fantasy XIII, I guess you could say for all practical purposes, was being designed for

458
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,860
the PlayStation 3, now it's coming out for the 360, do you think you're more inclined

459
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,740
to get it on PlayStation 3, or what system do you think you might ultimately get this

460
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
game on?

461
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,040
Or have you even decided yet?

462
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,200
Probably PS3, because if that's what it was designed for, then that's what it was designed

463
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,960
for, but it doesn't mean that, you know, later on I won't pick it up dirt cheap for Xbox

464
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
360.

465
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,840
I mean, depends on features.

466
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Loki?

467
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,080
I couldn't care less what system it was originally designed for, if it's coming out on the 360

468
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,440
and buying it on the 360, and that's just because I like the achievement system that

469
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
they have in place, I don't give a shit about these fucking trophies.

470
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,800
There are PlayStation 3 exclusive games I'm gonna be buying for the PS3, but it's pretty

471
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,600
much, if it's coming out on the 360 and the PS3, I will always be picking it up on the

472
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
360.

473
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,840
What if they come out and say, you know what, the 360 version did have to take a little

474
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
hit in quality?

475
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
I don't care.

476
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
I mean, it's gonna...

477
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Wow.

478
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,120
Well, now if I were you, if I heard one iota of the 360's gonna have to sacrifice something,

479
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
I'd pick it up on PS3.

480
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
I mean, look at...

481
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,660
I don't give a shit about achievements, so...

482
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,580
Name one game out there that runs better on the PS3 than the 360.

483
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,640
There isn't one.

484
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,360
It's always the other way around.

485
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,240
Sony Fanboys and chat.orangethesontraday.com, please.

486
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,560
I hear oblivion's a little bit graphically better, but I don't know, that's...

487
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah, but we're talking, like, marginally, I mean, like, this isn't gonna be, you know,

488
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,180
breaking any sort of, you know, there's no discernible difference in between the two.

489
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,800
You have to really, I mean, look at all the games that come out now and they do that stupid

490
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,540
comparison between the 360 and PS3 versions.

491
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,040
There's, like, minimal differences, unless, you know, you're talking, you know, when the

492
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,900
PS3 version comes out and there's, like, lag issues, frame rate issues, freezing issues

493
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,400
and stuff like that.

494
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
I don't know.

495
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,880
It's just, it's not worth picking up on the PS3 for.

496
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,320
Now, not to say that, like I said, there's stuff on the PS3 I definitely want.

497
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,200
Resistance Fall Man 2.

498
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,280
Fuck yeah, I will be getting that on the PS3.

499
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,360
All right, a couple people, a couple comments in chat, I know Jamie wants to say something

500
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
too.

501
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,000
Burnout Paradise is a game that's being mentioned, and Joshi16 gives the lulz with Metal Gear

502
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,520
Solid 4 plays better.

503
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,360
Yeah, but Burnout Paradise, okay, look at Burnout Paradise.

504
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
Hold on, let's let Jamie say it, because she wants to say something, I'm gonna go.

505
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,640
I was just gonna say, still, all of that actually means really nothing to me, because I had

506
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,000
already decided to get it on, you know, I had kept it in my head open that if it came

507
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,240
out on Xbox 360, I don't, first of all, it's not coming out in Japan on Xbox 360.

508
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,440
They're not going to get the release.

509
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,880
So this means that I can actually interact with a larger community on the PS3 version,

510
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
first of all.

511
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:35,200
I don't care about achievements, and I really don't care about going online, so, I mean,

512
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,820
I would be able to find more stuff, you know, a larger community, especially for me who

513
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,240
loves the fan side of it, that and, you know, honestly think that the controller scheme

514
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,600
lends itself better to RPGs on the PlayStation than on Xbox.

515
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,080
But the controller scheme's almost identical, I mean, we're talking like-

516
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,500
I've heard the control thing before, is that the PlayStation, I would even, you know, even

517
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,060
though I'm kinda not getting a PS3, I would agree that the PlayStation 3's got a better

518
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,420
controller than the 360, but I don't mind the 360's controller.

519
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,080
They're both, I mean, we're talking like the analog stick being moved in place of the directional

520
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,360
pad, I mean, that means absolutely nothing.

521
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
I don't know, there's something about the stability.

522
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
I'm sorry, I-

523
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,560
And as far as the online community goes, what's that have to do with platforms?

524
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,320
I mean, when people are playing like Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that, the community

525
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,320
is-

526
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,320
The other half of the fun for me is-

527
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,240
The games are identical in both systems.

528
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,120
The other half of the fun for me is actually going on international sites and seeing what

529
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,680
the, you know, the world reaction is.

530
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,820
I love looking at fan art, I love, you know, finding fan sites, I think it's fun.

531
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,320
But that's fine, but that's not platform specific.

532
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,600
You're not gonna only have PS3 fans.

533
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
That doesn't necessarily-

534
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,320
That'd be like, you know, saying, for example, that, you know, you have fans for Eternal

535
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,400
Sonata, but there's gonna be fans for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 version.

536
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,300
It doesn't matter, as long as you're playing it.

537
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,720
People are playing the game, it doesn't matter what platform choice they have, there's still

538
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,320
gonna be fans out there, and the community's still gonna be out there, regardless of what

539
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
system you pick it up on.

540
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,720
It doesn't, like, lock you into an exclusive fan club that only 360 fans can, you know,

541
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,680
visit people that play the 360 stuff versus PS3.

542
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,360
Alright, let me let the chat have the last word here.

543
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,880
Osfer says, isn't Versus 13 still exclusive to the PS3 in the US?

544
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,740
Even if it is, I'm sure that game will jump ship too.

545
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,280
Sales will probably be a big question as to whether that happens or not, I'd imagine.

546
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,560
Well, Versus 13, I don't think it's been announced for the US yet.

547
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,200
It's still Japanese only, and if that's the case, then yeah, it probably still is PS3.

548
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,880
And well, they showed the trailer at E3 a couple years ago, so I'm thinking it's gonna

549
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
be good.

550
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,080
Yeah, but they also showed the trailer for Star Ocean, like, two years ago too, so.

551
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,760
As Separoth1215 and Xenocore agree, say the D-pad on the 360 is what's horrible, and I

552
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,960
agree, you cannot, that D-pad on 360 is awful.

553
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,060
That's the problem with the controller right there, is that D-pad, because I don't like

554
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,320
to use the analog stick with a lot of Xbox Live arcade games, and that D-pad sucks.

555
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,400
Like, especially for, like, the retro games, and fighters.

556
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,360
That's the thing, that's what the PlayStation 3 controller, I think, is better as fighters.

557
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
But...

558
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,720
You know what, if they wanted to take a clue from the best controller ever made, they should

559
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,840
look at the Sega Saturn dual analog controller for their model.

560
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,640
I like the Super Nintendo controller, it was a lot less complicated, but I...

561
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,960
Well, the Super Nintendo controller, though, is also one of the, I think, the primary inspirations

562
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,480
for the PlayStation controller.

563
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
True, true.

564
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,720
Well, I'm sorry that you'll be handicapped when you get to the fighting game portions

565
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
of Final Fantasy 13.

566
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Alright, shut up.

567
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
We're moving on.

568
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Alright.

569
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,560
Uh, other big news out of Microsoft's press conference, that has to do with the installation

570
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,480
of Xbox 360 games to your hard drive.

571
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,880
They actually announced that now you're going to be able to actually copy the games to your

572
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,600
hard drive, so you can play the games directly off your hard drive.

573
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,720
But if you're thinking this means, haha, I can get them from Gamefly, copy them to my

574
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,440
hard drive and send them back, no, you still have to have the original disc to play the

575
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
game.

576
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm curious how long that takes to get cracked, though.

577
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Yeah, not long.

578
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm curious because people could probably burn their own CDs and bypass it.

579
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,720
I'm very interested to see how they security lock this.

580
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,320
We'll see, we'll see.

581
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,920
Also, you're going to be able to access the marketplace on the web, so if you, you know,

582
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,920
you're not next to the 360, you're, you know, surfing the internet at work like you shouldn't

583
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,580
be, you can actually go on the internet and queue up downloads to automatically go to

584
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,200
your 360, which sounds kind of interesting.

585
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,240
Something pretty awesome is if they had, like, a mode, and they have this, I think, with

586
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,720
a PS3 a little bit, where you can access your content from, you know, any hotspot or something

587
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,940
like that, but what if you could, like, say, leave your 360 in, like, a standby mode and

588
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,540
queue something up to download on your 360 from a PC that's, you know, nowhere near it

589
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,720
and then actually have it downloaded while you're out, you know what I mean?

590
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Right.

591
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,000
So, I guess that's kind of cool, though, if you, you know, don't like all those loading

592
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,720
times on Xbox 360 on certain games.

593
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
It doesn't, it doesn't sound like it's gonna really help the load times too much, it's

594
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,200
only gonna improve them by 30% from what I read.

595
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Hmm.

596
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Interesting.

597
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,200
But, I mean.

598
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,000
What games do you think will benefit most from this?

599
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,040
You can even do multi-disc installs, though, apparently, like, if you want to install,

600
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,160
like, disc 2 and 3 of Lost Odyssey on your drive, you could do that.

601
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,080
I don't know why you would, but you could.

602
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,560
Let me, it's nice that it's an option, you know, that's nice in case you want to do that

603
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,840
and you don't have to, but.

604
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,480
It would be nicer if I didn't have to have the original disc, but I, I mean, granted,

605
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,120
I understand why they're doing it that way, if they didn't, piracy would run rampant,

606
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,240
but I wish there was some other type of way it could be validated that I actually own

607
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,360
and bought the game, because I would love to just, you know, not have to swap discs

608
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,840
out all the time, like, just pop up a menu on my 360, pick the game and go.

609
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,000
Like the arcade games.

610
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I love that.

611
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,160
It would be nice, but I, I mean, I understand why that's.

612
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:52,880
Well, they could do that, but, you know.

613
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,400
Maybe authenticate, authenticating with a serial number or something.

614
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,280
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, like a serial key, just like they do with MMOs and

615
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
PC games.

616
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
Question mark, I don't know.

617
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,200
Xbox, think about that for next year's E3.

618
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
I would love to be able to do that.

619
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,120
It seems to me that the, the key code would probably be the best way.

620
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,640
But that's also a problem too, like if you look, I know this is a small market, but rental

621
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,120
market, you know, if you're renting it out with the manual and the key codes in there,

622
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
then.

623
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Yeah.

624
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
Yeah, we'll see.

625
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,360
Well, for anyone who's been looking for a sequel to Portal, there is an official one.

626
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,400
It's actually Portal Still Alive.

627
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,960
It's going to be basically the, the single player story that was in Orange Box with some

628
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
new challenges.

629
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,320
It's supposed to be on the Xbox Live Arcade.

630
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,080
Nothing about PC or PS3.

631
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,000
I think they already have this on the PC actually.

632
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,440
They released a map pack that was based off the Flash Portal game, the 2D one, and that's

633
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,800
what these levels are.

634
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,600
Those are those same levels that were available on the PC, I want to say for free, so.

635
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,680
But they've been, uh, la-di-daing this thing as an exclusive on the 360, right?

636
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,720
It is exclusive on the 360, this version of the game, like as a standalone thing, but

637
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,840
it really, it's just those download maps that were available on the PC for free.

638
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,240
You know what though I hear about this game?

639
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
There's no GLaDOS.

640
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,560
That kind of makes me sad, but.

641
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
That's sadness.

642
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
It is sadness.

643
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,360
But hopefully there will still be cake.

644
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,340
Maybe this time, Jamie, maybe there's pie at the end this time.

645
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,440
But there's no story.

646
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,600
It's just challenge levels.

647
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,920
It's like the VR missions and.

648
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,000
I guess, Jamie, you were, you were quite the fan of Portal and I think a lot of the reason

649
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,660
you liked it was the humor in it and the story, right?

650
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,820
Does this kind of, I don't know, to me this seems a little bit milking, but I, I enjoyed

651
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,160
the game in Portal 2.

652
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I really did.

653
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,680
So, but I'm kind of curious, what do you think about this?

654
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,160
Being that there's kind of less story, more just puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.

655
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,120
For the people who like the puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, that's good for them.

656
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,840
I just want snarky commentary.

657
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,560
If there's no snarky commentary, then.

658
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,240
But you could make your own.

659
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You know what?

660
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll let Dan play it and then I'll provide the snarky commentary.

661
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Alright.

662
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
You know what would make this game awesome?

663
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
What?

664
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,040
But they're, well, other than cake, is if later on for a few more Microsoft points they

665
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:16,400
could release a level editor for the, you know, arcade game and then release it where

666
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,640
you can share levels.

667
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,240
But then what would they do for the actual Portal 2?

668
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,540
For the actual Portal 2?

669
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,540
I don't know.

670
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,080
Well, I mean, this might be Portal 2, but you know what I'm talking about, like a Portal

671
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
actual full sequel with story editing.

672
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,800
Well, they can add some additional elements.

673
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:35,720
I think for the Portal PC game they had levels and stuff with alternate gravity sections

674
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,280
where you're actually on the ceiling and stuff like that.

675
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,360
Really twisty, weird stuff.

676
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,240
So if they add that into Portal 2, and I think Portal 2 is supposed to be kind of different

677
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,120
than Portal 1 altogether, you know, kind of a different environment, more like Half-Life,

678
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,520
then, yeah, there's a lot more to do.

679
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,560
Maybe the lesser face is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.

680
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,440
Plus there's, like, the guy that sounds like Colonel Sanders in there, so.

681
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,320
Oh, the G-Man?

682
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:08,600
No, no, the new guy, the new Ghost of Portal, you know, creator guy or whatever.

683
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,880
The one whose initials that you enter into the website to do the test that you can't

684
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
save the result of.

685
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I guess.

686
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,680
SSJ100 Matt says in chat, they better give a free Carvel cake coupon with the new Portal

687
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
because they lied to us last time.

688
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,680
That would be funny.

689
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,580
That would be great.

690
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:28,280
And some folks in chat are imagining the play at home with Dark Soccer making the commentary

691
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,880
to Dan while he's playing.

692
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:35,200
Joshi16 says, Dark Soccer to Dan, play better!

693
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,840
And ActDef says, complete the puzzle or the cube dies!

694
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,480
No, no, no.

695
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,640
Half the time with Dan playing is me just trying to shut up because I figured it out

696
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,560
the puzzle, only I get too motion sick to do it.

697
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,760
So I'll be sitting there going, hmm, and he'll be like, what?

698
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,400
I'll be like, you should have done the portal over there, because then it'll come up over

699
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,840
here, and if you do it this way, then this will happen.

700
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,080
He's like, oh.

701
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,880
He has that little, what I call the Charlie Brown cloud with a little cloud of steam over

702
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,400
their head, like they always got new cartoons.

703
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,520
I have to just bite my lip and not say anything.

704
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Ow.

705
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,360
Alright, anyway, moving on.

706
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,720
Alright, well, other news coming out of the Microsoft press conference saying, no, this

707
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,360
was a total shock, because this was kept under super secret wraps.

708
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:32,840
Lips, their new karaoke game was announced, and they had a lot of details on that, including

709
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,040
some pretty cool stuff.

710
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,800
Obviously, the microphones are going to be motion sensitive, and they're wireless, as

711
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,800
they should be.

712
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,840
They've got kind of like this little light thing on the bottom there, I guess that responds

713
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,360
to your voice, and they're really making this pretty much pick up and play, so if you want

714
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,800
to join in with someone singing karaoke, all you have to do is really just shake the mic.

715
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,120
And during the song, you can kind of tap the mic like you do in Rock Band to make a cymbal

716
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,960
noise and stuff like that, and I hear also other people that may be in the room and stuff

717
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,200
can pick up other controllers and hit the buttons on there and make music with that

718
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
as well.

719
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,300
So, eat that, we music.

720
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,560
This sounds interesting.

721
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,080
I'm down with Lips.

722
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,000
It looks a lot like SingStar to me, but I think SingStar is kind of fun.

723
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,780
It looks like, you know, this is Microsoft's thing.

724
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,360
They take other people's ideas and make them better, and well, granted, it's not Microsoft

725
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,240
themselves doing this as the Elite Beat Agents folks, but hey, I love Elite Beat Agents.

726
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,720
It looks pretty cool.

727
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
This will be a karaoke game.

728
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,800
There is some other cool stuff about that too.

729
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,880
They were saying that the music in this, you can actually hook up your, like an iPod or

730
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,480
any other music player, Zoom, whatever, and it will allow you to stream any songs that

731
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,860
you have on there, as long as they're not DRM'd.

732
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,760
You can use just normal mp3s and stuff like that.

733
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,880
The program actually performs like a vocal reduction on your own songs, and you can actually

734
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,760
be scored on your own songs as well.

735
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,240
Some other stuff that they had saying that they're not sure if they're going to allow

736
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,940
you to stream, like say, your library if you have a PC connected on your network.

737
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,600
You know, you can stream music usually.

738
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,320
Not sure if they're going to allow you to do that.

739
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,320
And also, no word if you're going to actually be able to implement your own lyrics or song

740
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
chart or something like that.

741
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,080
But they had some interesting ideas, I guess.

742
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,380
Some of the songs confirmed for it already.

743
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:40,080
They had Mercy by Duffy, Young Folk by Peter and, oh I guess, Peter, Bjorn, and Jon, and

744
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,320
Bust A Move by Young MC.

745
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,700
And I guess all the songs are master tracks and contain their original music videos.

746
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,440
And rap songs work a little bit different.

747
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,220
I guess it's not just about the rhythm in the game.

748
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,040
So it's kind of cool they have rap and singing and all that stuff.

749
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,640
I can't wait to rap.

750
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,920
Hopefully we can get Loki to rap and put it on YouTube somewhere.

751
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,480
Ahhh, no.

752
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,760
Alright, are you excited about Lips?

753
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
No.

754
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Alright.

755
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,600
You're not a karaoke fan, right?

756
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Not really.

757
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Alright, well I'll buy it.

758
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
I'll admit it.

759
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
I like karaoke.

760
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,400
I'm just hoping that it reads on my ABBA CDs correctly.

761
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,120
Well, exactly.

762
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,240
Because if you can put in your own music, we're having ABBA night.

763
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:27,720
Well, what they should do is they should have it where you can plug in, you know, how they

764
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,920
have the CDDB and stuff like that where you can pop in CDs and it'll, you know, detect

765
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,880
what songs it is and stuff like that.

766
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,240
If you could do that, say, with this game as well with MP3s, and it'll detect what song

767
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,000
it is and automatically download the lyrics, that'd be pretty awesome.

768
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,480
We're going to reenact the Mamma Musical, or Mamma Mia Musical right here.

769
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,040
It'll be fun.

770
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,080
Alright.

771
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Not on the air though.

772
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,280
The listeners have done nothing to deserve that.

773
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,120
Hey, more details coming out of Microsoft's camp, including that big dashboard update

774
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
that's been rumored.

775
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:03,640
There's going to be a huge dashboard update coming a little later this fall, and apparently

776
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,400
some of the cool stuff that they're going to be putting in this dashboard update is

777
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Netflix integration.

778
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,760
If you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber and a Netflix subscriber, you can now use Netflix

779
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,280
on your Xbox 360.

780
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,720
You can stream movies from your Netflix queue to your 360, which I think is kind of cool.

781
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,740
The thing is though, you know, only certain movies, the ones that they allow to be streamed

782
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:27,280
on the internet will do this, not in HD, sadly.

783
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,560
It's going to be SD only for now, but they say when Netflix is ready to do HD, Microsoft's

784
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,240
ready to bring HD home.

785
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,420
So that's kind of interesting.

786
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,800
The big shock and awe, avatars, oh, we didn't see anything of that coming, but yeah.

787
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,360
The avatars, which are kind of like the Mii ripoffs, but of course, you know, they want

788
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,600
to do a little bit better.

789
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,280
So now not only do you have these avatars, but now you have these little like rooms that

790
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,320
your avatars can go in.

791
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,280
It's not like home, but it kind of is.

792
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,120
It's not even really, I mean, because it's just like this big white room, kind of like

793
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,440
the construct.

794
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,480
You can still use your gamertags pictures, like if you have an Orange Laundrio gamer

795
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,040
pic, because we actually have one on the marketplace, I don't know if you've seen it.

796
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,380
It's in community gamer pics too, but if you have like your OLR gamer pic, you can still

797
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,840
use it, but they are going to kind of try to get people to switch over to avatars, which

798
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,800
yeah.

799
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,280
Games will now be able to give you avatar unlocks.

800
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,840
But that's not too much of a surprise when you consider games as it is, can give you

801
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
gamer pics.

802
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,740
It's just that a lot of games choose not to do it.

803
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,040
Now I got a question for you.

804
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,000
Do you feel ripped off at all, I mean, I know you can use your like themes with, I mean,

805
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,840
but it's like in the background, like far background in this stuff.

806
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,880
It's not quite as integrated as before, but do you feel ripped off for like buying say

807
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,420
like themes or gamer pics off of Xbox Live and now they're going to switch it all over

808
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,880
to avatars, because you know they're just going to fucking sell like clothing and shit

809
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,120
for your avatars, and that's how they're going to make even more money off that crap.

810
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,120
I agree, it's all Gaia.

811
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,880
Eh, I haven't bought any of that stuff in a while, so I'm okay.

812
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,080
You know, ever since the OLR gamer pic came out, I have no use for other gamer pics, and

813
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,920
as far as themes go, not a lot of that stuff makes me actually want to go, ooh, I want

814
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,400
to spend a dollar for that, because you can get custom themes off your PC.

815
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,000
As long as I can still do that, I'm down.

816
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,240
As long as I can still do that.

817
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
That's special.

818
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,840
Also, I want to point out real quick before we move on, another thing that was announced

819
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,040
is Xbox Live Prime Time, and one specific thing that was announced is a version of One

820
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,360
Versus 100, and this is actually something where they're going to have like a live night

821
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:35,480
where you can be a part of this game show thing using your avatars, and supposedly you're

822
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,640
going to be able to win real prizes, so you could be playing in your Xbox as one of the

823
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,640
people in The Mob in this One Versus 100 show.

824
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
That sounds fun.

825
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
That's kind of interesting.

826
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,040
It's a very casual gamer friendly thing, too.

827
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,320
I can imagine whole families getting around to play this type of game.

828
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,520
You know where they used to have some sort of service like that, I'm not sure if it's

829
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,360
still around now, where you could do that with like TV shows and you'd actually be playing

830
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,960
along with the live TV show?

831
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,600
I don't think Game Show Network does that.

832
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Yeah.

833
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
On their website.

834
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Well, not necessarily through that.

835
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,680
This actually was like its own device or something.

836
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
You know what it reminds me of?

837
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,960
The old Berkeley Systems games on the PC.

838
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,340
Like I don't know if you guys ever played Acrophobia or, God, there was the other game

839
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,200
with the tower in it, and I apologize if you're hearing that noise, I don't know what's causing

840
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
that.

841
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,720
It must be, it sounds like a cell phone noise or something.

842
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,840
That's a cell phone interacting with speakers.

843
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,800
Okay, I don't think they got that on the show, sorry.

844
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,320
Whoa, hello, live radio.

845
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,720
But yeah, it reminds me of that, like that Berkeley Systems stuff back in the day.

846
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,840
I used to love those games, those game shows, they're so much fun.

847
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,820
So I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out on Xbox, hopefully it doesn't all

848
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,160
crash the first night because you know that's something that is likely to happen.

849
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:50,240
Well, in other news, more stuff for Xbox Live Arcade is a present for us from the people

850
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,240
who brought us Pac-Man Championship Edition, and it's called Galaga Legions.

851
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,640
So it's very shiny and pretty.

852
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:05,280
And it's the same sort of redesigned, you know, same type of play that, you know, starting

853
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,680
to stick with the style but trying to beef it up for the modern era.

854
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,720
So it's shiny.

855
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
That's cool.

856
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,680
I mean, but again, it's going to be one of those things where you start to go, why did

857
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,280
I buy the original Galaga when this is available now?

858
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,200
Well, the original Galaga came out in the 80s and you were probably five.

859
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,640
I know, I know, but still.

860
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,960
I don't know, this resembles more like Geometry Wars than Galaga.

861
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,200
It's definitely a lot more flashy.

862
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,800
It's kind of one of those things I want to get my hands on to see how it really works.

863
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,040
Yeah, because Pac-Man Championship Edition was only like half Pac-Man to me, you know

864
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
what I mean?

865
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,800
There was a whole different strategy to it than in the regular Pac-Man, even though at

866
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,560
first glance it looks the same.

867
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,840
I'm assuming Galaga will be similar, who knows?

868
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,160
I think it's going to follow that type of suit.

869
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Yeah, most likely.

870
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
Cool.

871
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,200
Well, this week there's actually some game releases coming out, which is nice.

872
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,400
Not a whole lot, but you know, some okay stuff I guess.

873
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:08,520
And starting things off here on the DS, I know Rob is looking forward to this, Final

874
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,280
Fantasy IV making its way out.

875
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,160
Also on the DS this week, Azsuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns, and I know a lot of people

876
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,200
like that one.

877
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,840
On DS as well, and I played a little bit of this a few weeks ago, new international track

878
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,000
and field for the DS.

879
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,900
If you really want some frantic, I guess stylus rubbing on there, that's going to be a game

880
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,900
for you.

881
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,160
Now, also on PC, a bunch of smaller titles here.

882
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:48,520
City Life 2008 edition, Baseball Mogul 2009, Uber Soldier 2, The End of Hitler, awesome

883
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,520
title there.

884
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,480
And let's see here on the DS also, Nancy Drew, Mystery of the Clue Bender Society.

885
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:08,920
On the Wii, we've got Kid Sports Crazy Golf, another shovelware title from Destineer.

886
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,960
The Mummy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor on PS2, Wii, and DS.

887
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,880
Sadly enough, I think that's the biggest game this week.

888
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:20,560
And Order Up on the Wii, yet another Cookie Mama type game.

889
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:29,040
And finally, this I believe is on the Xbox Live Arcade and PS3, or PS Network.

890
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:36,360
We've got 1942 Joint Strike coming out on the Arcade this week.

891
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,800
Still sounds like a pretty busy week for releases, considering it's the week after E3, but it's

892
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,240
summertime too.

893
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
So I'm very excited about Final Fantasy IV.

894
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,540
I was looking at the website, looking at some of the trailers that have been released this

895
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,540
week.

896
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,520
You know, the game's been out in Japan for a while, but I've been surprisingly staying

897
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,980
away from a lot of the news that has come out about it.

898
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,360
And I am quite excited to check out Final Fantasy IV on the DS.

899
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,240
Have you seen much of it?

900
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Not really.

901
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,840
God, they have voice acting in it.

902
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,800
And you want to know one thing I learned from the voice acting?

903
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,480
I always thought the main character's name was Cecil.

904
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,840
That's what it looks like, right, Cecil?

905
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,720
Cecil is apparently the name, if you listen to the voice acting.

906
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:21,080
That makes sense, because I don't think there's a C sound in Japanese.

907
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:25,080
I was just surprised a little bit, I mean, you know.

908
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,800
All these years, I'm thinking one thing and it turns out it's the other.

909
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,800
It's blowing your mind.

910
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,120
It's just blowing my mind, exactly.

911
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,480
Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the release dates that are going to be

912
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
happening over there.

913
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:41,200
In fact, the entire Asia region is getting a version of Wall-E on the Xbox 360 this week.

914
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,080
But over in Japan specifically, Bully Scholarship Edition finally makes its way to Japan on

915
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,680
July the 24th, as well as their local version of Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock.

916
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,560
It is the same song list, if you were wondering.

917
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,760
It is not a J-Rock song list.

918
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,200
If it was, I'd be importing that shit, because that would be a lot of fun, I think.

919
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:05,040
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Kung Fu Panda, as well as the PlayStation 3 eye camera pack.

920
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,000
I guess that's some type of new eye bundle.

921
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,660
Also, Siren, isn't that like the remake of the first Siren on PlayStation 3 or something?

922
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,560
New translation.

923
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,160
It's the episodic game now.

924
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,160
So there you have it.

925
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,640
That's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

926
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,680
Wangen Midnight finally gets a price reduction.

927
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,880
Good, because that game blew ass.

928
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Fucking A, I wish I hadn't bought it.

929
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,400
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, it's a pretty busy week over there.

930
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,760
Kung Fu Panda, Mesaze Sori Master, Sakai ni Challenge Hen, comes out, as well as Samurai

931
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:43,440
Spirits, Rokuban Shobu, and Speed Racer the video game, as well as Wario Land Shake, all

932
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,240
come out on the Nintendo Wii this week.

933
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,120
Samurai Spirits is Samurai Shodown.

934
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:54,800
Yeah, some type of compilation package, it looks like.

935
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,800
That's cool.

936
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,240
Yeah, it's their version of Samurai Shodown Anthology.

937
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
So that's pretty cool.

938
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,240
Although, I'm surprised they wouldn't just do that for Virtual Console, because they're

939
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,760
releasing Neo Geo games on Virtual Console now, and I guess if there are people that

940
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
will buy it, they will release it.

941
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,480
Especially if it's got all the way up through 5 and maybe the 64 versions, even though they

942
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,480
were shitty.

943
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,480
Gotcha.

944
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,040
A couple price reductions on PlayStation 2, including Biohazard 4, Resident Evil, Busou

945
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,000
Orenken, Burnout Dominator, as well, but coming out new on the PlayStation 2 this week, their

946
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,400
own version of Bully's Scholarship Edition, as well as the Samurai Spirits Anthology collection

947
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,800
comes out in Japan this week as well.

948
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,000
Moving to the handhelds, the DS, you can get some new little sticky film things for your

949
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
DS.

950
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,200
All for the Peanuts gang, hooray, because I guess the Peanuts are actually still really

951
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,280
big in Japan, if I'm not mistaken.

952
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Yes.

953
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,920
Speed Racer comes out on the DS as well, Twilight Syndrome, as well as SimCity DS gets

954
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,640
a price reduction.

955
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,920
Kung Fu Panda gets another release over there on the DS.

956
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,640
And Kirarin Revolution, Mina Di Odoro, Furi Furi Debut comes out from Konami.

957
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,560
I'm thinking it says Revolution in the title, so first you think it might be a music game,

958
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:12,020
but no, it's some other type of little action game that looks cutesy.

959
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,800
You'll know a lot else about that game, sorry.

960
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,880
Checking out the PSP real quick, and then we'll call it a wrap for Japanese dates this

961
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,880
week.

962
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,760
On the PSP you get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, a price reduction, Guilty Gear

963
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:32,840
Accent Core Plus, and, too bad there isn't a plushie, Infinite Loop comes out as well.

964
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,880
Accent Core Plush would be funny, it's all stuffed animals fighting.

965
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,360
Fighting each other, that'd be awesome.

966
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,200
That's it for your Japanese release dates.

967
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,200
In the UK, just a few things, on the 22nd, Yuzuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns on

968
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:51,160
DS, on the 23rd, 1942 Joint Strike on Xbox 360, the same one to be out the next day on

969
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:59,360
PlayStation 3, 25th, Buzzmaster Quiz, Race Driver Grid on DS, Romance of the Three Kingdoms

970
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,600
9, I'm sorry, 11, shit.

971
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,560
God, I remember the first one.

972
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,400
Super Swing Golf on Wii.

973
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,840
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9 is on PC.

974
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
Wow.

975
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Cool.

976
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,840
Alright.

977
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:22,080
Well, the next big conference that we had up during E3 was, of course, Nintendo, and

978
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:27,120
one announcement that they made was that they're gonna be branching out from their normal games

979
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,160
and bring us a sequel to Wii Sports.

980
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,360
Awesome.

981
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,520
Wii Sports Resort will be coming to the Wii, and it will be bundled with a brand new accessory

982
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,680
that's called the Wii Motion Plus, and what the Wii Motion Plus will do for your Wii Remote

983
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:50,120
is allow you to actually have one-one motion-sensitive capturing, so be able to detect the finite

984
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,200
movements of your wrist and arm and et cetera, stuff that probably should have been included

985
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,880
in the remote in the first place, but oh, we couldn't fit it in there before.

986
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,000
But since it's a Wii Sports game, everybody will buy it, so we'll be okay.

987
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,960
It will be coming with one of those, and all the other ones will cost you extra money.

988
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,080
I wanna see- no, I haven't heard what the price of those were.

989
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,080
Something was $29.99.

990
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,240
Hopefully it wasn't the Wii Motion Plus things.

991
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,880
I'm curious how many games in the future will require this.

992
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,240
Probably a lot.

993
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:25,100
And what's included so far, what they've announced in Wii Sports Resort is there's Disc Dog, which

994
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,920
is like a frisbee game that you play with a little dog, as seen in-

995
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,920
Aww, that's cute.

996
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,280
What was it, uh, Wii Fit?

997
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:40,520
There is a, um, a jetski racing game, which I forget if they actually call it, um, looks

998
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,760
kind of like, um, I guess, I don't know, a jetski racing game.

999
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,760
It's kinda cool.

1000
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,600
Wave Race 64, maybe.

1001
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,640
And finally they had sword fighting in there as well, which people-

1002
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,640
Cool!

1003
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,160
But they made the swords look like lightsabers, sort of, so, you know, people-

1004
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,160
Oh my god, lightsabers!

1005
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,160
I gotta buy this!

1006
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
I gotta buy this!

1007
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,680
Everyone the Star Wars game they wanted.

1008
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,320
Except it's not really lightsabers, it's just, you know, poles.

1009
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,320
Big pole nerfsabers.

1010
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,480
Yeah, poles that look like, uh, happen to look like lightsabers.

1011
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,480
They said that there's-

1012
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,480
Nerfsabers sounds fun.

1013
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,760
There may be, um, up to ten games in this pack whenever it's released.

1014
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,780
It's not supposed to be out there until spring of next year, so, um, got some time for that.

1015
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,480
You know what's funny though, out of all the E3 predictions out there, I would think that

1016
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:31,000
a sequel to Wii Sports getting announced would be, like, a so frickin' obvious thing.

1017
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,480
I didn't see a lot of people predict that.

1018
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
Well-

1019
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,740
It's not one of those things when they announced it, I was like, oh, of course.

1020
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,740
Of course!

1021
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,600
Well, here's the thing, here's my thing, is, it makes sense for them business-wise, because

1022
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,320
you have a problem where people are picking up the Wii and all they're playing is Wii

1023
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,320
Sports.

1024
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,120
So, if they want to sell games to this market that's not really buying games, well, their

1025
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,280
best bet would be to put a sequel out for Wii Sports.

1026
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:58,640
I don't know, it's definitely going to be selling very well.

1027
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,720
I don't know if they're going to convince everybody that bought, you know, the Wii Sports.

1028
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,640
It would sell better if they get that crap out by Christmas.

1029
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,640
Yeah, it-

1030
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,480
I'm kind of surprised it's not.

1031
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,360
Well, I don't know.

1032
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,280
Um, it'll be interesting, I guess.

1033
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,800
I'll have to check it out when it actually comes out.

1034
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:19,360
Alright, another big game that Nintendo was triumphing at their press conference was Wii

1035
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Music.

1036
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,720
Wii Music is that kind of that game you've seen a little bit in development slowly but

1037
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
surely over the years.

1038
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,720
Like, I think it started as that orchestra demo you saw at the first E3 where they showed

1039
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,720
Wii.

1040
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
And that game is special to me already.

1041
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Years ago?

1042
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,720
Why is that?

1043
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:33,720
Because that's when I met Koji Kondo.

1044
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,720
Oh, okay.

1045
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,920
That's- I'm glad, Lisa, there's something special for you.

1046
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,040
I got to tell him that he was the one that inspired me to start off as a music major.

1047
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,040
Oh, nice.

1048
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,320
Even though I didn't change- even though I changed my major later.

1049
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
That's alright.

1050
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
He didn't need to know that part.

1051
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,400
Uh, but also, you know, you see- and you saw a little bit of this, I think, at the years-

1052
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,400
years future on.

1053
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,600
Well, apparently, 50 instruments are going to be included in this.

1054
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,120
You use the remote, you use the nunchuck.

1055
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,000
You can also tap your foot on the balance board to kind of simulate a drum set.

1056
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,280
Uh, apparently, you're going to have violin, guitar, marimba.

1057
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,120
I'm hoping there's a sitar in this but nothing's been said about that yet.

1058
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,120
That one is zither.

1059
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
Um.

1060
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,120
Or an autoharp.

1061
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,360
Here's what Miyamoto has said about this game.

1062
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,160
Wii Music is a slightly different play experience than you've seen with other music games.

1063
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,640
Now most music games require you to press buttons with precise timing to symbols on

1064
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,640
the screen.

1065
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,720
So we've designed Wii Music to allow everyone, including those who can't read music, to enjoy

1066
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,880
the experience of playing music.

1067
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,240
Now the interesting thing about this, like, from what I've been hearing from E3 attendees,

1068
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,120
is that this game is shit.

1069
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:39,280
Which is kind of sad, in a way, because it's kind of like a good concept, but it does sound

1070
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,960
like they took the game out of the game.

1071
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,960
Yeah.

1072
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,680
And now you have a noise-making device.

1073
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
Well here's the thing.

1074
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
That's basically what it's turned into.

1075
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,680
Here's the thing.

1076
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,960
Miyamoto came up on- on stage and said, who would have thought that we would have sold,

1077
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,960
you know, millions of bathroom scales, and laughed at it.

1078
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,960
You know?

1079
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,640
And he laughed at it because, like, you smug asshole.

1080
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,640
And I don't really, you know, I'm not seeing that he's laughing at, you know, the people

1081
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,840
that are buying this stuff, but in a way, you can kind of look at it like this is absolutely

1082
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,480
ridiculous that people are buying this shit.

1083
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,120
Wii Music, okay, let me put it this way.

1084
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:18,600
If you walk down your average toy aisle at any major retail store out there, you will

1085
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:24,360
find these stupid instruments that you can literally pick up and tap a button, one single

1086
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,260
button, and it will play a song.

1087
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,960
You can tap it fast, you can tap it slow.

1088
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,320
This is exactly what you'll be buying with this game.

1089
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,200
There's absolutely no way to play the song wrong because all you're doing is tapping

1090
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,720
buttons and pretending.

1091
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,720
You know what's funny though?

1092
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,200
I still think this game is going to be huge.

1093
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,560
I think there- I think there is an audience for this game.

1094
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,640
Yes, there is an audience.

1095
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,860
It's the casual market that will buy these shitty Destiny-er games that come out because

1096
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,400
they look cool and they'll drop, you know, 20 bucks on them and the games are absolute

1097
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,400
shit.

1098
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,360
Miyamoto is a genius because, you know, us hardcore gamers, at least, you know, I'm

1099
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,520
looking at this going, where's the game?

1100
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,520
Where's the game?

1101
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,520
And they're going to sell millions.

1102
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,520
Well, great.

1103
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,640
You know, I'm glad that they're going to sell millions of this because, you know,

1104
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:11,100
they would sell millions of a good game as well and, you know, their loyal fans who buy

1105
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,400
all these games that come out each time are kind of disappointed.

1106
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:20,720
I know, I was like, after watching the whole press conference from Nintendo, I'm like,

1107
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:21,720
that was it?

1108
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,920
That was a fucking waste of time.

1109
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,960
I have to ask Jamie because she did say, you know, she was favorable to the orchestra thing

1110
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,060
when she saw it, but hearing that they've kind of taken the game out and now you've

1111
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,320
got a music simulation device, is this still interesting to you?

1112
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,600
Yes, very much so.

1113
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,320
I'm sorry, I was a music major, I was in band.

1114
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:44,340
I would love to get other people together who are likewise musically inclined and see

1115
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,340
what we can do.

1116
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,680
I mean, I loved a lot of the MIDI Sims that did that.

1117
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,880
I worry, though, that this game isn't going to have that kind of depth.

1118
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,200
Like I would think, especially if you're going to get a bunch of music nerds together

1119
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,680
to do it, I would think that the game would need more depth and I worry that this game

1120
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,680
is not going to have it.

1121
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,600
I mean, prove me wrong, Nintendo, please do, but that would be my concern.

1122
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,840
They said that there's no way to play this wrong.

1123
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:08,680
I mean, literally all you're doing is tapping a button and it plays a song.

1124
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,840
It's just like a one button song, like you have the keyboard, so play the one button

1125
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,800
song where you can tap the key and it will just kind of play a little MIDI thing.

1126
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,560
We actually watched, I remember when we were watching them actually play this during the

1127
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,280
whole thing, it was hard to watch.

1128
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,520
They butchered the Super Mario theme on there.

1129
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,260
It was crap.

1130
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,840
It looked horrible.

1131
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,540
I would not be touching this game at all.

1132
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,480
It doesn't look fun, but you know what?

1133
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,240
Little kids and stuff that want to play music and stuff like that, it might get them interested

1134
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,240
in music, but it's going to be one of those things, just like Wii Fit, unfortunately,

1135
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,480
for a lot of people where you pick it up, you buy it, and then all of a sudden, wow,

1136
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,160
I'm not playing it anymore, and they've already got your purchase, and they've already made

1137
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,780
their money, and now they're going to be hawking you the next piece of shit thing that they're

1138
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,520
going to throw out there for the casual market.

1139
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,520
You know what?

1140
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,120
You did hit on something good, though, is that if it gets more kids interested in music,

1141
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,840
then it's a good thing, because I was a band geek in school.

1142
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:08,760
I would think that they would add in some sort of difficulty or control level, you know,

1143
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,720
add a little bit more freedom in what you're allowed to express with it.

1144
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,100
That was what my thought was.

1145
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,040
If there's a didgeridoo in the game, I'm sold, though.

1146
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,440
I take back everything I said to play the didgeridoo.

1147
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,160
Well, let's just, when we see a little bit more, and maybe we're lucky, and they'll be

1148
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:31,200
showing this off at PAX, and we'll actually get to play it, but my expectations of this

1149
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,880
game weren't that high to begin with, because it seems like they keep forcing this stuff

1150
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
down our throats.

1151
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,160
They were showing this off before the Wii ever came out.

1152
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,800
They showed this off last year at E3, when Miyamoto came on stage.

1153
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:48,080
Everyone's anticipating this game coming out, and every time I saw it, I was just like,

1154
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,560
I don't really give a crap about this.

1155
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,080
This looks stupid.

1156
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,960
And sure enough, they come out on stage during the press conference now, and yeah, it was

1157
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,960
stupid.

1158
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,400
Thank you for totally fulfilling my expectations on this piece of product.

1159
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,340
The other thing about having the one-button control is, if I'm right, you are the conductor

1160
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,920
also, right?

1161
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,260
I think they have a conductor mini-game in there.

1162
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,080
As a conductor, though, if I can understand having the one-button melody part playing

1163
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,300
as being conductor, because it is the conductor's job to signal when the next part comes in

1164
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,880
by following along with the music.

1165
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,160
So, you know, by reading the score, you have to signal to make sure that, first of all,

1166
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,120
even though the band is supposed to be keeping up with what's going on, they're supposed

1167
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,080
to know what you're doing, you still have to signal them, you still control volume,

1168
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,000
you know, keep the time.

1169
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
They're going to follow you.

1170
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,520
I would expect that that would make sense for a controller mode.

1171
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,280
I just worry it's not going to have that kind of depth.

1172
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,760
I think it's just going to be, hey, kid, waggle the thing in the air, you're a conductor,

1173
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,760
wee!

1174
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,680
I think they should have difficulty settings to allow for a broader market to play it.

1175
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,280
But there's nothing, there's no on-screen cues, there's nothing.

1176
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,040
It's literally, there's a little drum beat going along and you decide whether you want

1177
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,800
to tap your thing with the song or whatever.

1178
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,840
What they should have done, and this could have opened it up for the entire market instead

1179
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,080
of just, see, that's the problem.

1180
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,720
They can't just develop for everybody, they just want to either develop for the casual

1181
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,160
market or the hardcore market.

1182
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,880
They can't see past developing something that would appeal to both.

1183
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,880
And what they should have done is added something like Mario Paint where you could orchestrate

1184
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,720
your own music, you know, make it where you can have four different tracks or eight different

1185
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:25,960
tracks that you can record on using different instruments, and you can play different notes

1186
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,000
depending on how you had it angled and that kind of stuff, and do it that way.

1187
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,440
And then if you don't, if you're not interested in that, that's too complex for you.

1188
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,240
You can sit there and tap your finger to the music or whatever.

1189
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,120
Well, we need to move on, but I will still close with this.

1190
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:44,880
I don't care if the game is a piece of flaming poo, if it gets five-year-olds saying, hey,

1191
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,760
I want to play a real marimba someday or I want to play a real, you know, saxophone,

1192
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,200
French horn, whatever, then it's a good thing.

1193
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,200
So we'll see.

1194
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,800
I like that you said saxophone and French horn together because they have very complementary

1195
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,800
tones.

1196
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,600
I pulled instruments out of my ass that I remember from marching band.

1197
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,320
You know what game, though, I think they should make that would be a good music game?

1198
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,320
What's that?

1199
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
You know what a theremin is?

1200
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,320
No.

1201
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,960
It uses analog wave signals to play music, like it's got one that goes out vertically

1202
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,480
and one that goes up horizontally, and you use your hands in between the waves.

1203
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,720
Oh, okay, I've seen that, yes.

1204
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,920
You control the music that you play.

1205
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,280
One of them is your volume and the other one is your pitch, and you can wiggle your fingers

1206
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,940
a certain way and it'll do staccato or, you know, do it slowly.

1207
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:35,240
It'll be more flowing, but they should do a game that mimics a theremin.

1208
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,040
Wouldn't that be cool?

1209
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,000
I got to get some comments from chat because, you know, they're commenting on it.

1210
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,260
GS68 says, I want Wii cowbell.

1211
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,440
They have the cowbell in there.

1212
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,440
I'm serious.

1213
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,440
I'm getting it.

1214
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,440
It has a cowbell.

1215
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,080
Peeger Junior 92, or PK, I'm sorry, I always get the two names, PK Junior 92 says, Rob,

1216
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,000
how would you play a didgerid thing with a Wii, because he can't spell it, a didgerid

1217
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,160
do with a Wiimote?

1218
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,160
I don't know.

1219
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,520
How are you going to play all this other shit with a Wiimote?

1220
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,520
They'll make it work.

1221
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,600
It's Nintendo.

1222
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,680
They create miracles every day.

1223
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,560
Frisbee says, but those kids aren't going to do that, Rob.

1224
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,640
I bet you're wrong.

1225
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,640
They say more people are taking guitar lessons because of Guitar Hero, trying to learn how

1226
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,060
to play the real thing.

1227
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,440
I know what you're thinking, Debbie Downer, but I bet you're going to be wrong.

1228
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,440
I hope you're wrong.

1229
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:23,080
Not to be all pessimistic or anything, but seriously, if you're really excited about

1230
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:29,120
Wii Music and you haven't watched the conference yet, I urge you to at least watch that portion

1231
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,840
of the Nintendo Press Conference, because you will be disappointed.

1232
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,920
I mean, it literally, it's just like, ouch.

1233
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,800
Alright, let's, new game, new Nintendo game, please.

1234
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,800
Stuff.

1235
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,680
The game called, um, Nintendo Does Shit is coming out, and no, I'm kidding.

1236
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,760
And Nintendo Does Shit all over your wallet, it's amazing.

1237
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,200
No, it prints money.

1238
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:57,120
This is, though, the happy news, I think, of E3 for a lot of Nintendo fans, is Animal

1239
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,360
Crossing City Folk, which will be, um, I mean, basically it's the same sort of graphical

1240
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:07,880
style that we know way back in the Nintendo 64 era of Doublesu no Mori, you know, because

1241
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,640
that was the first version that came out, was on Nintendo 64.

1242
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,720
In other words, they added widescreen and that's it.

1243
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,560
Pretty much.

1244
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:21,400
But, um, the neat thing about this one is that you can use your Wii message board, um,

1245
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,360
to send messages to your friends, and you can put on masks that look like you're me.

1246
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,360
That'd be cool.

1247
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:32,880
Um, especially if whoever gets goats say me.

1248
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,580
There is also a microphone option that's called Wii Speak, so you can talk to other players

1249
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:46,120
around the world, and it's just pretty cool.

1250
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,160
I don't know what to think about this.

1251
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,160
I'm excited.

1252
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,160
I'm gonna buy it.

1253
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,160
I'm getting it.

1254
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,160
Granted, I'm getting it.

1255
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,440
I have to be able to send nasty messages to villagers everywhere.

1256
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,080
I hope it's one of the things where it works a little better in theory, because the problem

1257
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:03,040
with Animal Crossing DS, the problem with that is that there's no island.

1258
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,240
Well, not just that.

1259
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,000
You had to coordinate with people in order to be able to visit their village, which granted

1260
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,920
was a step up from the GameCube one where they had to actually be at your house.

1261
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,360
But I think that's kind of why the DS one lost its charm, is they really didn't add

1262
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:20,680
that much from the GameCube one, and you kind of had to do all this coordination.

1263
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:25,440
I am hoping in this one that it uses that Wii Connect 24 for a good thing where I can

1264
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,480
go to people's villages in the middle of the night and steal their fruit.

1265
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:36,520
Plus, I'm hearing they took the whole, like, you know how there was like a game in it?

1266
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,720
Is it the game, in a sense, is to pay back Tom Nook for your house, right?

1267
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,840
I'm hearing they took that out, that there is no game now in Animal Crossing.

1268
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,160
It's just do stuff.

1269
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,880
No, no, no, they can't take that out, but I'm thinking since it says city folk, maybe

1270
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,880
it's going to be a much broader place.

1271
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
I hope.

1272
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,520
Well, they say that you now can travel to a city, like a New York City style place where

1273
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,120
you can get your hair done and there's all this other stuff.

1274
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,960
So you live in the suburbs?

1275
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,960
I guess.

1276
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,240
You live in a, you know, well, it's all by train, right?

1277
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,560
So you live in a train's away town and you can go to the big city and get all this other

1278
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,560
stuff.

1279
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,760
That is sort of very Japanese, isn't it?

1280
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,760
In a way.

1281
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,400
It's also kind of lame, though, I mean, and I hate to put the pessimistic spin on everything,

1282
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,640
but here's what they basically did with the city portion.

1283
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,320
The city portion, remember how there was little events that would happen at specific times

1284
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,240
during the week where you would have, I forget the bitch's name, they'd come and try to sell

1285
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,240
you the expensive...

1286
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,240
Sahara?

1287
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,820
Yeah, Sahara, that she would sell you the expensive clothing.

1288
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:36,820
They had the guy…

1289
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,840
Oh, she sold the carpets.

1290
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,400
The carpets, okay, they had the other people that sell the expensive clothing, they had

1291
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,960
the people that would sell the rare like furniture and stuff like that.

1292
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,680
Well, guess what, now you don't have to worry about going to your town specific days, you

1293
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,240
just go to the city and it's all there.

1294
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,720
I mean, what's the point?

1295
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,600
I mean, the whole point is you go back to your town and actually be able to play it

1296
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
and stuff.

1297
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,620
I think you're still going to have events that are specific to your town.

1298
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:00,780
There has to be, they're just going to expand on it.

1299
01:06:00,780 --> 01:06:02,480
There's gotta be new things.

1300
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,840
What I think is they're going to, this is my vision, this is what I would do, is that

1301
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:13,080
they would take those features that you may not, you know, that we've all gotten used

1302
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:16,840
to, that we know on this day X person's going to be there, give them their boutiques in

1303
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:22,080
the city, but have special festivals, have a carnival maybe, something that happens in

1304
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:26,800
your town, that have very limited objects that you can maybe get like once a month or

1305
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
something.

1306
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,960
You know, and it's, this wouldn't be a big surprise for me, but I honestly don't think

1307
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:38,280
there's going to be, there will be hardly any innovation from the GameCube version,

1308
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,040
let alone the DS version with this version.

1309
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,600
They're literally pumping out the same fucking game on every system so far.

1310
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:49,160
I did get the impression this game's kind of already in the can, that this game's just

1311
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,400
waiting to be released already.

1312
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,800
And you know, it's not a bad, I mean the game's good, it's fun, and you'll play it for a while,

1313
01:06:55,800 --> 01:07:00,680
and then you'll get bored of it like all the other ones, but it's like they're not even

1314
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,680
trying.

1315
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,360
It's like, okay, we put out the same game again, people will buy it, let's release it.

1316
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,400
I would like to see more things that you have to accomplish with other people.

1317
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,480
I think that would be great, like you have to do, like in order to get super rare things,

1318
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,920
you have to work with somebody else, I mean, because it would give this whole WeSpeak thing

1319
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,080
a use, because right now this thing is screaming gimmick.

1320
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,080
Maybe you have a job.

1321
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,240
Like besides just working for Tom Nook?

1322
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,360
Yeah, maybe like you can be a baker.

1323
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:26,800
There's so much more they could do with this.

1324
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,360
Look at Broken Blast Works, okay, you can make custom ships in that game.

1325
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,720
You can make custom levels, custom everything.

1326
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,960
Why can't you make like custom furniture?

1327
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,700
Have like a very basic building thing where you can like make simple geometric shapes

1328
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,000
and put patterns on them.

1329
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,460
I mean, why can't you do that?

1330
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:43,960
Gotta read comments from chat.

1331
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,360
Game Guru says a carnival was confirmed for City Folk.

1332
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:48,400
So that's kind of cool.

1333
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,160
Frisbee says there better be a freak show in the carnival.

1334
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,760
That would be awesome.

1335
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,040
I want to have the bearded lady move to my village.

1336
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:02,080
I want more than four characters in my village, which would be nice.

1337
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:05,360
I also want like say when you're not playing your characters that they walk around and

1338
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,840
do stuff, which would be also cool.

1339
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,640
I also want to be able to put the Mii masks on the other villagers that are in there in

1340
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,560
case I don't like their ugly face.

1341
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,360
Joshi16 says Animal Crossing is the new Harvest Moon.

1342
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,360
I don't know.

1343
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,360
If you have some comments you want to have read on air, chat.orangesontrader.com when

1344
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:25,960
we chat live on these Sunday nights at 6 o'clock pacific time at allgames.com.

1345
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:33,280
Well, something that the only thing during the Nintendo press conference that had me

1346
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,840
excited that this conference actually might turn around was the brief announcement that

1347
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:42,480
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was coming to the DS.

1348
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,160
And that is exactly all we know about it, other than it will take place during Liberty

1349
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,520
City and yeah, it's being worked on.

1350
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:57,480
No word other than that what exactly this is, but I'm excited because it's Grand Theft

1351
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:58,680
Auto.

1352
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:04,320
And then immediately the conference turned around and went back to shit again.

1353
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,760
Did they show any screens or anything from this game?

1354
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,440
Nope, they just showed the logo and that was it.

1355
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,640
If I were to guess, I'd say it's either, I think it's going to be like a top down game

1356
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,640
just like the original Grand Theft Auto game, but it's going to be more massive.

1357
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,360
I mean, if they do 3D, they might be able to pull it off.

1358
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:23,520
I mean, they've pulled it off on the PSP, but I thought the PSP is a lot more powerful

1359
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,520
than the DS.

1360
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,520
We'll see.

1361
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
I don't know.

1362
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
All right.

1363
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,520
Well, moving from Nintendo to Sony.

1364
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,160
Sony had the last press conference of E3 this year and they announced some changes coming

1365
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,960
to the PlayStation Network.

1366
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,840
The video delivery service is finally hitting the PlayStation Network and the cool thing

1367
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,080
about it though versus the Xbox 360 is that you can actually get your movies on a PlayStation

1368
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,960
3 and then move it over to the PSP.

1369
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,360
You can actually play the thing on both devices at the same time if you want.

1370
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,640
So it's kind of interesting that if you buy it on one place, you can get the portable

1371
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,080
version as well.

1372
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,880
That's kind of cool and a feature that the other, since Microsoft doesn't have the handheld

1373
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:06,880
marketplace so well and Nintendo doesn't have an internet service they could do this with,

1374
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,480
that's kind of neat.

1375
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,680
The rumored prices right now, $2.99 for a standard definition rental, $6 for a high

1376
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:21,000
definition download, $14.99 if you want to actually purchase the movie, no idea yet about

1377
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,560
high definition pricing.

1378
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:26,400
Apparently the store went up right after the conference and you can get such movies as

1379
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,440
Rambo, Cloverfield, The Bank Job, all right there.

1380
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,440
That's cool.

1381
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:33,440
They needed that.

1382
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,440
But here's a tip.

1383
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,440
Don't get Cloverfield on HD.

1384
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,960
There's no point.

1385
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,280
They don't sell the movies in HD yet.

1386
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,280
Oh, okay.

1387
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,280
Not yet.

1388
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,280
But soon.

1389
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,760
Soon is the all encompassing word for us, isn't it?

1390
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:55,000
Well, and then something else regarding the Wii and what Nintendo's got released is the

1391
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:02,920
Wii Speak microphone, which they brought up the Wii Speak with Animal Crossing, but it's

1392
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:09,280
called a community microphone and it's supposed to sit on top of your infrared bar on top

1393
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:15,400
of the TV and bring up basically everything in the room from what I understand.

1394
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,400
Hooray.

1395
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,840
So now everybody in my house can hear the obscenities people are shouting at me on the

1396
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,840
internet.

1397
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,000
Well, it's like a conference phone type of thing.

1398
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
We'll see.

1399
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
We'll see.

1400
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,920
It's an interesting departure from the traditional headset thing.

1401
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:28,920
I'll give them that.

1402
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:29,920
I do like that though.

1403
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,920
But I don't know.

1404
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,120
I hate wearing headsets.

1405
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,060
It's not the device that I'm worried about.

1406
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,800
It's the implementation of it.

1407
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,800
That's the thing.

1408
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:38,800
If that makes sense.

1409
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,120
At least it's not a camera.

1410
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,120
I'll give you that.

1411
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:43,120
I'll give you that.

1412
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,720
I don't want a camera on my Wii.

1413
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:56,080
Well also though, some other interesting news was that, especially regarding Sony, is that

1414
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:03,360
they have released information saying that there will be a $399 80 gig PS3 available

1415
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:10,280
in September, and labeled as the 80 gigabyte core pack.

1416
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:17,720
That actually sounds kind of neat, but it's definitely the price drop from the $499 bundle

1417
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:22,720
that currently has the 80 gigabyte system.

1418
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,360
But it's not really a price drop because what they're doing is getting-

1419
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:26,360
It doesn't have Metal Gear.

1420
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,120
Well, it doesn't have Metal Gear.

1421
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:32,840
And they also basically are getting rid of the 40 gig system.

1422
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:36,200
Kind of think of it like the PSP, because the PSP, they have the core systems, and then

1423
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,960
they have these entertainment bundles that they put out a fucking ton of.

1424
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,200
And the PS3 is getting the same thing.

1425
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,840
You're going to have the $399 core system, the 80 gig, which by the way does not play

1426
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,240
any PlayStation 2 games at all.

1427
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,600
It has the same backwards compatibility as the 40 gig system.

1428
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,520
That's what I was about to say, actually.

1429
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,520
Sorry.

1430
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,200
You jumped in on what I was saying.

1431
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:03,960
But hey, 40 gig system with a larger hard drive, so that's awesome.

1432
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,960
I guess, though, having the 80 gig, if you're going to announce this movie thing, I mean,

1433
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,680
I guess that's what you're going to need the space for, right?

1434
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:13,480
If you're going to download all these movies, then they want you to have the bigger hard

1435
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,480
drive, right?

1436
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:18,360
So in the end, they win, right?

1437
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,880
It makes it a lot more simplified, because if they just leave it at the 80 gig system,

1438
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,920
you can just do, okay, the PS3 system is $399.

1439
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,640
If you want this bundle, it's $499.

1440
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,160
But it kind of devalues the bundle a bit, I don't know.

1441
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,400
But something you may want to purchase for your 80 gig PS3 core system will be God of

1442
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:46,880
War 3, which unsurprisingly was announced at Sony's press conference, and they showed

1443
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,640
off a little full motion video teaser trailer, and yeah, it's God of War.

1444
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,680
Was there any actual gameplay footage?

1445
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:02,240
Not one, but it's all CGI, and it's expected sometime after this holiday season, which

1446
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,080
could be any time.

1447
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,200
Maybe this spring at the earliest, maybe never at the latest.

1448
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:15,040
Alright, well, not only did Sony- Actually, I would probably go with the latest,

1449
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:18,200
because they always seem to delay their releases of stuff.

1450
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,820
Well, not only did Sony announce the obvious, which I would say is God of War 3, but they

1451
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,840
announced something a little bit unexpected, I think.

1452
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,480
It has to do with what's a new type of game they're calling a MAG, a Massive Action Game.

1453
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:34,720
You know how an MMO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game?

1454
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,320
Well, this was supposed to be like that, but with an action game.

1455
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:44,640
Apparently 256 players- Are there that many people playing online with the PS3 right now?

1456
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,640
Probably.

1457
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:49,880
The 256 players can actually all play this game at once.

1458
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,560
It's just apparently this giant free-for-all type game.

1459
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,240
You can get live statistics actually as you're playing.

1460
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:00,580
It does look like a war kind of game, and seeing as it is being developed by the folks

1461
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:02,800
who make SOCOM, it does make sense.

1462
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,520
It's eight-player squads, is what you're in.

1463
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,520
It's kind of interesting.

1464
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,520
Kind of interesting.

1465
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:13,480
It's kind of an expansion, I guess, on the 64-player multiplayer for Resistance 2, where

1466
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,280
you're in squads on that as well.

1467
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,720
I guess, though, it does kind of- You know, I said a long time ago on this show, and I'm

1468
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,640
sure other people have too, you know, we have these massively multiplayer role-playing games.

1469
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,920
Where's our massively multiplayer other types of games?

1470
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,920
And here you go.

1471
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:32,560
Well, they had Huxley that was supposed to be coming out at some point, but still hasn't.

1472
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,960
But I don't know.

1473
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:37,640
I mean, see, that's good, though, that they announced something like that, because that's

1474
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,680
something that Microsoft doesn't have.

1475
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,680
That's something that can differentiate themselves.

1476
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,740
But I don't know.

1477
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,920
And home is still coming, and it supposedly looks a little bit better, from what I saw

1478
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:49,920
at the press conference thing.

1479
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,920
All right.

1480
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,000
Well, Loki's going to sum up some other E3 highlights for us, but first, I just kind

1481
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,120
of want to go around and get everybody's highlights and lowlights from the press conferences.

1482
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:06,040
Best announcement you heard, and worst announcement you heard, Loki?

1483
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,320
The worst announcement I heard was the entire lineup from Nintendo.

1484
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:13,440
Seriously, that press conference was hard to watch.

1485
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,200
When I was done watching it, it was like, I want my 90 minutes back.

1486
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:19,240
Absolutely horrible.

1487
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,840
The best announcement?

1488
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,840
I don't really know.

1489
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,840
I mean, I was kind of excited about the...

1490
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,440
There will be something that will be mentioned in the last minute stories that I think is

1491
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:33,400
the most exciting announcement of everything.

1492
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,080
Nothing really excited me.

1493
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,080
Nothing really...

1494
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:42,200
I'm very indifferent towards all of it, just because it was all stuff I expected anyway.

1495
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:48,480
The least exciting thing for me is that little motion extra device thing on the Wii, because

1496
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,840
it's just now another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy, because other games are going

1497
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,240
to have to implement this, because it probably should have been in there in the first place.

1498
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,740
Most exciting thing?

1499
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:01,740
It's hard to say.

1500
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:05,920
As excited as I am about Final Fantasy 13 and the whole fact that I've saved money on

1501
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,400
a PlayStation 3 with that, I think I'm going to have to get a PS3 eventually.

1502
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:16,820
So I would actually say I think the live prime time thing is one of the most...

1503
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,640
Because it really was kind of a surprise.

1504
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,880
A genuine surprise, and something that sounds pretty exciting and different, and reminds

1505
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,040
me of the whole Berkeley systems days.

1506
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:28,960
So I'm going to say that's the most exciting thing I heard in those press conferences.

1507
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,120
Loki, any other things from the big three we might have missed?

1508
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,120
Okay.

1509
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:37,420
Starting off here, there was some Xbox Live Arcade announcements.

1510
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,920
Quite a few of them, actually.

1511
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,320
Some surprising stuff, too.

1512
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:46,920
They were of course showing off Banjo-Kazooie 3 Nuts and Bolts, while another announcement

1513
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:51,000
that they made along with that is that the original Banjo-Kazooie will be coming to Xbox

1514
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,560
Live Arcade later this year.

1515
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,820
Which is surprising, because that was an Nintendo 64 game.

1516
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:01,560
There was also something else that they showed off that was kind of cheesy and stupid, but

1517
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:09,480
you're in the movies, which is an Xbox game that uses the vision camera, and will be bundled

1518
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,240
with the vision camera when they sell it.

1519
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:17,040
It is a game that they have you doing stupid little mini games in there, and based on the

1520
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:21,760
movements that you do in those mini games, it will make a B movie for you, starring yourself

1521
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,280
and your friends.

1522
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,520
And you can actually edit your own stuff together if you want.

1523
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:31,200
It sounds like a pretty fun party game, but very cheesy.

1524
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:39,720
Now as I alluded to before in the highlights, this is actually my favorite announcement.

1525
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:49,080
Castle Crashers, Galaga Legions, Braid, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2, all gonna

1526
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:55,840
be out on Xbox Live Arcade within the next 4-6 weeks.

1527
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,440
That's fucking awesome.

1528
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:06,760
Other things, Halo Wars, supposed to be out the first half of 2009, looked kind of cool.

1529
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:16,960
There was some other stuff, let's see here, actually I want to say that August 6 is when

1530
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:22,020
Geometry Wars 2 is going to be coming out, so that's pretty cool.

1531
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:27,920
Not really part of the press conference, but Apogee came back, remember them?

1532
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,560
They used to do shareware games.

1533
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,560
Yes, they were awesome.

1534
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,560
But isn't that pronounced Apogee?

1535
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,560
I think it is Apogee.

1536
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,240
Jill of the Jungle, like what?

1537
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,320
Well, they're bringing Duke Nukem to the handhelds, which made me ask, where the fuck's

1538
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,360
Duke Nukem Forever, bastards?

1539
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,280
But that was interesting.

1540
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:52,480
They showed off a Resistance Fall Man PSP game, that's due out Spring of 2009, it's

1541
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:57,880
gonna be kind of like the Killzone PSP game, so that's kind of interesting.

1542
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:05,520
And this is gonna make you very happy, Rob, actually, there's, well, not really, there's

1543
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,560
rumors that, you know, that MotionPlus controller add-on that they're gonna have, yeah, eventually

1544
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,400
it's gonna be integrated into the Wii remote, so.

1545
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,400
Shock.

1546
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,360
So yeah, all that money wasted for stuff that should have been there in the first place.

1547
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,360
Ha!

1548
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,640
I just glanced at Justin.tv, I forgot about this one, did you see the Sony game Fat Princess?

1549
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:29,640
Farmboy44 in the Justin.tv chat says that, that game looks hilarious.

1550
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,840
That does look funny.

1551
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,480
And then I wanna say that, I'm trying to think what else that was really cool coming out

1552
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,480
of there.

1553
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,040
I don't know, some of the gameplay stuff that they were showing off, like Resident Evil

1554
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,560
5 looked kind of neat with the co-op and stuff that they announced that you can do there.

1555
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,840
And I don't know, the Playstation home stuff looked alright.

1556
01:20:54,840 --> 01:21:00,200
The one cool thing that really impressed me though about the Playstation conference was

1557
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:05,680
that they showed off, actually part of their presentation was done in LittleBigPlanet.

1558
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,680
And it was really cool.

1559
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,520
That was cool, I saw a little bit of that, that's neat.

1560
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,560
See, that's how you make their conferences interesting, okay?

1561
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:15,840
That game has me absolutely excited, can't wait to play that, October for that one at

1562
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,840
least.

1563
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:21,800
And I wanna say that was pretty much it.

1564
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:29,520
There was really, you know, no big game announcements as far as like DS stuff I think.

1565
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,220
I mean everyone was expecting like, I think they announced a new Pokemon Rangers game

1566
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,480
which is just whoopee doo.

1567
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,520
No Pokemon Platinum announcement, even though we know that's coming.

1568
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:45,560
But once again, Nintendo said that this E3 conference was not about the core gamer, it

1569
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:51,920
was about casual gamers, which, okay, I guess we'll just have to wait until you announce

1570
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,920
all the cool stuff.

1571
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,240
You know, get the crap out of the way, I guess.

1572
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,080
Alright, well we have plenty more to announce about E3 a little later in the show from the

1573
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,440
other companies that weren't just the big three.

1574
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,000
We'll be getting into more of that in part B tonight as well as some other non-E3 news

1575
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,320
that happened this week if you can believe it.

1576
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,960
But before we take our break and get to part B, it just would not be an episode of Orange

1577
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,000
Lounge Radio.

1578
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:19,680
If we didn't take a minute to pay some respect to our elders in gaming and Dark Soccer, having

1579
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:23,560
gone to California Extreme, I'm sure must have been inspired from hundreds of games

1580
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,560
this week.

1581
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,240
I actually didn't see this one there though.

1582
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,240
Wow.

1583
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,240
I was a little disappointed.

1584
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:35,920
Huh, alright, so we have something completely, I guess, outside of the realm of what you

1585
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,080
saw, just something you were hoping and thinking about this week, so it must be pretty darn

1586
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,080
good.

1587
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,080
Let's take a look.

1588
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,080
It's the Classic Game of the Week.

1589
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,920
What should the kids be playing this week?

1590
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:52,760
The game of the week is Kix, which is one of my all-time, all-time favorite games ever,

1591
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,720
which became also the model for later some like, Galaxian gaming.

1592
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,720
Hell yeah!

1593
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,720
Woo!

1594
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,320
But you hear the sounds, this is what you got when you played.

1595
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:08,360
It was this little vector series of lines that would move across an empty rectangular

1596
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,960
space and you were a dot.

1597
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,960
It's like Attack of the Windows screen savers.

1598
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:23,040
And what you had to do is box in to gain a super majority of the screen, so you also

1599
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,200
had these little spark things though that would travel on your lines that you would

1600
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:34,480
form a box in the Kix and it would, if it hit you, it would destroy you also if the

1601
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,920
Kix hit the line that you were drawing, it would also destroy you and you did have a

1602
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,920
timer too.

1603
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:51,360
So your whole, the whole point of the game was to claim a certain percentage of the screen.

1604
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:57,600
I've actually managed to get the 95 percentile closure on the screen before just by making

1605
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,600
a trap box.

1606
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,280
It requires some pretty good strategy to do well.

1607
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:13,760
But there's also a fuse that will burn out part of the line.

1608
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:19,720
It actually will, if it makes it from one way, from one side to the other, then you'll

1609
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,140
actually lose your life.

1610
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:28,320
But that's if you stop moving, if you start moving again the fuse will stop where it is.

1611
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:34,240
Also as the game got, as you progress through the game, you would actually get two Kix on

1612
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:39,720
the screen, which you could actually easily pass the level if you could bisect the screen

1613
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,440
so that one was on either side.

1614
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:48,400
It really is a lot harder than it sounds, it's a very difficult game past the first

1615
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:53,760
couple of stages, but it's one of my all time favorites, it really is.

1616
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:54,760
It's pretty awesome.

1617
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,280
Have you ever played Super Kix?

1618
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,100
No, I have not.

1619
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,880
They have it available on MAME, that's the only way I've played it, it's a little more

1620
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,480
graphics in it, but kind of fun.

1621
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:11,520
The versions of Kix that I have is the Atari 5200 version and the Nintendo version of Kix.

1622
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:17,080
And it's really so simple, and very frustrating, and I'm like, I'm going to beat these stupid

1623
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:18,280
lines into a circle.

1624
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:23,320
Yeah, I remember in Super Kix you could get letters that you would actually unveil if

1625
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,800
you siphoned off certain parts of the screen, which is kind of interesting.

1626
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:33,000
But in the way that this, though, has been incorporated into, like, Gals Panic is uncovering

1627
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,040
certain portions of the screen instead of covering them with your blocks.

1628
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,280
And you get to see some boobies if you uncover the right part of the screen, like in Ms.

1629
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,160
World 96 Nude, which you know is an OLR favorite.

1630
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,160
Yes.

1631
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,160
Alright.

1632
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:54,000
No, but the old school Kix is pretty awesome, so, alright.

1633
01:25:54,000 --> 01:26:01,920
So, one other thing, the versions that are out, by the way, is Atari 5200, Commodore

1634
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:11,240
64, DOS, Amiga, which is graphically enhanced, Apple IIGS, Game Boy, I actually do have the

1635
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,320
Game Boy version now that I'm thinking about it, NES and Atari Lynx.

1636
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:22,160
There was a port for the Game Boy Color that was called Kix Adventure.

1637
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:26,280
And then, I don't know if you're saying that it's on GameTab right now.

1638
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:31,880
And you can also find it emulated on multiple systems and get Taito Legends 2 and Taito

1639
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,320
Legends Power Up on PSP.

1640
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,520
Act Def says Kix for Xbox Live Arcade.

1641
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,600
Dude, yes.

1642
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,800
But you were mentioning Super Kix.

1643
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,680
And those Kix 2 tournament in 1982 and Super Kix that you were talking about, and there's

1644
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:49,560
Twin Kix that was a prototype as of 1995 that never came out.

1645
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:56,760
However, there is a main release that you can play, and then there was Volfield, but

1646
01:26:56,760 --> 01:27:00,560
it was Ultimate Kix Neo on PlayStation.

1647
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,660
So there's also, of course, cell phone versions.

1648
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:06,640
And as I was saying before, Gals Panic was also based off of Kix.

1649
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,560
It's almost a dead clone of it, except for boobs.

1650
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:21,800
Capcoma Night in Busyland, which was on SNES, Jezzball Sonics, Eric's Stix, Ultimate Kix.

1651
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,200
There's actually a mini game version in Bully.

1652
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:29,880
And Stix Reloaded, which was a freeware version, were all knockoffs of Kix.

1653
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,760
So plenty of ways to get your Kix on.

1654
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:32,760
Yeah.

1655
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:33,760
All right.

1656
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,320
Well, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1657
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:39,440
We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1658
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,480
And if you're listening on the podcast, that means just let it keep playing, because we're

1659
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,000
going to take a quick commercial break, and we'll be, actually, we're calling them not

1660
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,880
commercial breaks, because they're just not paid stuff.

1661
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:53,420
I want to say with that, too, well, I'll explain it at the beginning of Part B. We're accepting

1662
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:54,420
your contributions for this.

1663
01:27:54,420 --> 01:27:56,060
So what's the antonym of commercial?

1664
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,060
I'm not sure.

1665
01:27:57,060 --> 01:27:58,060
Anti-commercial?

1666
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,060
Public service announcement?

1667
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,060
Anti-commercial?

1668
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,060
Non-commercial?

1669
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:02,960
They're non-commercial breaks.

1670
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:03,960
Yes.

1671
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:04,960
They're indie commercial breaks.

1672
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,960
I don't know.

1673
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,600
Well, commercial means pretty much something for money, right?

1674
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,600
They're free breaks.

1675
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,600
Free breaks.

1676
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,600
Yes.

1677
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,600
We're going to take a free break.

1678
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,600
There we go.

1679
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,600
We're going to take a free break.

1680
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,120
Just to explain really quickly, it's probably the only time I'm going to mention that.

1681
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:19,860
For those of you on the podcast, you will only hear our original stuff and the promos

1682
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,080
on the free break.

1683
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:25,220
For those of you that are listening live tonight, you're going to hear a song or two as well,

1684
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:28,520
because we actually need to take a stretch break, get some water and all that good stuff,

1685
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,480
so you get a little bit longer when you're listening live.

1686
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:39,440
But we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1687
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:40,440
Hi.

1688
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:44,400
This is your buddy Rob Roberts here from Orange Lounge Radio with an important message.

1689
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:49,360
Every year, thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food

1690
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,720
shooting.

1691
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:56,040
Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.

1692
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:01,360
Health needs food badly, so please, think twice before shooting food this holiday season.

1693
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:05,720
The blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag

1694
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,840
that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.

1695
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:19,280
Remember, don't shoot food.

1696
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:24,640
From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes

1697
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:30,760
Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

1698
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:31,760
That's right.

1699
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:35,760
The highly anticipated sequel to the community created hit using the DDR simulation program

1700
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,320
Step Media is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing

1701
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,720
new songs danced in.

1702
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:46,480
You'll play all new theme choruses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite

1703
01:29:46,480 --> 01:30:06,360
Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura.

1704
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,680
Please note there are no real songs sung by Dark Sakura because it would lead to the entire

1705
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:13,360
Orange Lounge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a bow fire on an ocean

1706
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,640
of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano, sorry.

1707
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:28,080
You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan, John D.M.N.

1708
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:43,880
and a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't

1709
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,200
want you to hear.

1710
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,680
So come and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

1711
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:53,520
When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplayed.com.

1712
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,680
It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while

1713
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:03,360
on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck, but I pooped from there, ha ha there you go.

1714
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,520
And it's only from the Nintendo Wave.

1715
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,680
So come on down to your local participating Liberty City Game Store, split a work or breach,

1716
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:13,480
bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

1717
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:18,120
If you do, Lucky might dress up as Tana, not a guarantee.

1718
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:23,800
Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice because the

1719
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:31,440
army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing, to get the snipers prepared psychologically

1720
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:36,080
to be willing to kill as snipers, well except that asshole.

1721
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:42,600
And now back to Orange Lounge Radio, there's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay

1722
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,360
of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and

1723
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,360
teenagers.

1724
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:56,480
Someone get the hook, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely July 20th, 2008.

1725
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:01,040
Jamie has a very perplexed look on her face, it looks like she swallowed a fly, I'm twitching,

1726
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:07,560
I hope she won't die, um, you'll have to swallow a spider to catch the fly, wow, bringing us

1727
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:11,640
back to grade school, I don't know why I swallowed a fly, we're bringing it back to grade school

1728
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,120
here on Orange Lounge Radio, we're so old school, we're preschool, hey if you want your

1729
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:19,160
promo or your funny PSA play, because that was all in house stuff tonight, including

1730
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:24,520
the Grand Theft Auto 4 entry from a few months ago by the 100A SSJ 100 Matt, if you have

1731
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:28,840
some other stuff that you would like to contribute, including hey if you have a podcast, we have

1732
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,280
people calling in to our program to hoard their own podcast, if you have a website,

as long as it is not for profit and you're a hobbyist, by all means, send us your promo,

1734
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:40,880
there's more information available on Orange Lounge Radio.com, just get in touch with me,

1735
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,040
we'll play it on a future show.

1736
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:47,000
If it's funny, we'll definitely play it, but if it's not funny, we'll put it in line.

1737
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:54,240
Alright, for now though, we're back to it, here on episode number 288, if I haven't lost

1738
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:59,360
count of Orange Lounge Radio, whew, haha Rob can count, I can, I'm a winner, alright, more

1739
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,000
news from E3 that didn't necessarily directly have to do with the press conference, Loki

1740
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,720
start us off, um, there was an announcement, I don't know why they decided to cut this

1741
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:12,160
because it's, I don't know, it seems kind of no-brainer to me that I would announce

1742
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:16,240
this during an E3 press conference, but there was a new Halo game that they were going to

1743
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:21,800
be announcing, but meh, we didn't have time, that was literally the excuse, we didn't have

1744
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:33,120
time, um, could put out a, you know, written press release about it, um, I did know that,

1745
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:39,280
like, I want to say the, a Walmart, they had a listing in their database for a game called

1746
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:44,280
Halo Blue, whatever the hell that's supposed to be, so, is that like Pepsi Blue?

1747
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:49,080
I hope not, because Pepsi Blue looked like Windex and probably tasted like Windex, it

1748
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:53,560
kind of did taste like Windex, actually, did you ever have Pepsi Blue?

1749
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:59,640
No, because it looked like Windex, well, this is, this is, you know, my thought, Red Bull

1750
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:05,400
looks like pee, so I don't drink that, Pepsi Blue looked like Windex, so I wouldn't drink

1751
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:06,400
that.

1752
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,800
What if a new drink, drink came out that looked like paint, would you smell it?

1753
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,800
No.

1754
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,800
Okay, just curious.

1755
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:14,400
I didn't sniff paint.

1756
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:18,840
I think they should do a new Halo game based off of Red versus Blue, which would be fucking

1757
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,840
awesome.

1758
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,240
There you go, alright, so, no, in all seriousness, you know, okay, so a Halo, a Halo announcement

1759
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:28,400
gets pulled for time, uh, wow, what the heck, I mean, did they maybe just not have enough

1760
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,280
to go off of, maybe this game is just way too early in development?

1761
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,000
Are they sitting on it for PAX?

1762
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,180
Are they waiting for the giant orgasm that will fill the Seattle Convention Center when

1763
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:39,180
that's announced?

1764
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:40,180
Do I smell Omega-Thon?

1765
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:45,720
Well, I might be a little early for that, I don't know about that, uh, I don't know.

1766
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:50,720
Dude, we get to watch Omega-Thon this year, that's gonna be kind of rad, we'll have to

1767
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,720
see.

1768
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,720
We'll have to sign up for Omega-Thon if we can.

1769
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,120
You can't, it's randomly chosen out of people that pre-register.

1770
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,760
Damn it, alright, that's right.

1771
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:01,400
And I, I think if we did get in as press, yeah, we probably wouldn't get to do that,

1772
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:05,640
but if we don't get in as press, then that's disappointing.

1773
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,640
Alright.

1774
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,040
Cause even they have denied us.

1775
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,280
Well, look, anyhow, so maybe this Halo game is just being waited on till later, but when

1776
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,400
later is, who knows, maybe they'll just sit on it till next year when there's actually

1777
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,800
more game to show.

1778
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,480
Because even if they did announce it, I'm sure it's not a game coming out till 2010.

1779
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,480
We'll see.

1780
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:26,840
And the game we had no idea was coming out here at Orange Laundry Radio, this completely

1781
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,400
took me by surprise at E3, was Dead Rising for the Wii.

1782
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:32,560
I don't know about you guys, but I was just, like, floored by this announcement.

1783
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,560
What?

1784
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:34,560
Cause I've never heard of this before.

1785
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,560
Dead Rising for the Wii?

1786
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:36,560
I know.

1787
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,560
That's just insane.

1788
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:38,560
Alright.

1789
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:43,360
That's such a unique idea to me, I've never thought of Dead Rising on the Wii.

1790
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,440
Well here's the thing, is that, you know, in all seriousness, even though, you know,

1791
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,760
it has been announced as coming out for the Wii, apparently they're, I don't wanna say

1792
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,720
they're dumbing it down a little bit, but they kinda are.

1793
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:57,560
Basically, the real-time missions are gonna be gone, now you're gonna have sub-missions

1794
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,640
that you beat in the game, and then you'll do a major plotline quest.

1795
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,600
So now the game has become a little more linear.

1796
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,040
But some people actually think that might be a good thing, because some people thought

1797
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:10,440
the 360, the way it was done there, was a little bit frustrating.

1798
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:16,480
The camera apparently has now been changed, and now it's a behind and above type view,

1799
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,380
more like what they had in Resident Evil 4.

1800
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:21,820
So now it's kinda like one of those over-the-shoulder things.

1801
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:26,240
And the photo mode is now gone, so you can't take, you know, the pictures, like you did

1802
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:27,240
in the 360 one.

1803
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,240
But it was kinda...

1804
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,240
I won't miss it.

1805
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:30,240
It was a little silly, anyway.

1806
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,240
I mean, it was fun for a minute.

1807
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:34,120
As long as you can still run over zombies with a lawnmower, I'm happy.

1808
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,600
That's really all you need, I mean, to make Dead Rising.

1809
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,160
And please, God, save... or, save the save system.

1810
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,240
No, fix the save system.

1811
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:44,240
Please.

1812
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:48,360
Alright, well, Dead Rising Wii coming out soon.

1813
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,960
And by soon he means January.

1814
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:58,480
Well, you know, and I remember Bobby actually mentioning this on his show earlier, but there's

1815
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,440
some higher-ups that hate E3.

1816
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,640
Hate it, hate it, hate it, the way it is.

1817
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:06,800
I like to consider myself one of those higher-ups, but apparently I'm the only one that does

1818
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:07,800
that.

1819
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:16,160
Well, it was actually stated by the EA big guy, okay, now I'm gonna totally butcher his

1820
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:17,160
last name.

1821
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,200
His first name is John.

1822
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:19,200
His...

1823
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,200
Riccitello?

1824
01:37:20,200 --> 01:37:21,200
I think?

1825
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,200
Whatever.

1826
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:27,040
Anyway, he says, he's quoted as saying, I hate E3 like this, and that they want to go

1827
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:30,240
back to the old E3 or do their own private events.

1828
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:36,400
And the Ubisoft director, well, the Ubisoft boss said, yeah, it was terrible.

1829
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,560
In fact, to quote him, he said, E3 this year was terrible.

1830
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:45,560
The world used to come to E3, now it's like Pipefitter's show in the basement.

1831
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:50,080
I think that the EA guy would be complaining, seeing as, well, EA was one of the four major

1832
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:55,420
companies that approached, you know, the ESA and said, we want you to change E3 because

1833
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,820
we don't like it the way it is.

1834
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:58,600
They're never satisfied.

1835
01:37:58,600 --> 01:37:59,600
They don't know what they want.

1836
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,600
They're like a little kid.

1837
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:11,840
Well, there was, it actually was the Ubisoft, someone from Ubisoft named Alain Corr was

1838
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:19,760
also, you know, saying that he didn't really care for it all that either, too.

1839
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:28,320
But one of the things that I think should be pointed out is that while they, yeah, they

1840
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:32,000
were the ones that wanted it, I think they didn't expect it to turn out the way that

1841
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,600
it did.

1842
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:39,680
That I think that it was such a drastic departure that they are just now beginning to see, you

1843
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:43,800
know, to them what would be a detriment.

1844
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:49,760
One thing that I think was pointed out by Corey is that he's kind of saying it's one

1845
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:54,440
milestone in the communication of your products throughout the year and it's important because

1846
01:38:54,440 --> 01:39:00,760
it's the ramp on for Christmas, but he had said that in mid-July that wouldn't be something

1847
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,760
appropriate.

1848
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,140
Now, what I'm thinking is that if they wanted their big event, they should do something

1849
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:07,440
closer to the end of the year.

1850
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:16,560
You know, have E3 be your meetings and everything and then do E3 to the sequel in November or

1851
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,560
something.

1852
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,320
Which is what E4 All was supposed to be.

1853
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,720
But people didn't see that way.

1854
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:23,960
It should still be the same E3, I think.

1855
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,640
The same format as before.

1856
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:29,440
EA still kind of strikes me as the Goldilocks of the game industry right now.

1857
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,740
This convention is too big.

1858
01:39:31,740 --> 01:39:34,160
This convention is too small.

1859
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:37,600
They're looking for a convention that's just right.

1860
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,760
But you know, I don't know.

1861
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:45,560
All that aside, I just think publishers, in part, the people that were going to E3 are

1862
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:49,840
partially to blame for why E3 went in the crapper.

1863
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:55,200
I mean, the year Paris Hilton showed up at E3, that was the year I was like, something

1864
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,200
ain't right.

1865
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,820
I just can't believe the people who actually wanted to go see her.

1866
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:00,820
So blame yourself.

1867
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,560
I mean, honestly, blame yourselves for ruining E3.

1868
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,520
I think if they're going to bring E3 back on a big spectacle, which it seems like maybe

1869
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,520
EA is going to start bullying them to do it, have some freaking responsibility with what

1870
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,160
you decide to show at these shows.

1871
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,680
I don't care if Paris Hilton has a cell phone game coming out.

1872
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,280
Keep it the fuck out of my show.

1873
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:23,160
I think that what they should do if they're going to have the celebrity events like that,

1874
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:29,600
they put them in the, what was the other hall that the little games had to hang out in?

1875
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,600
Cancha.

1876
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,600
Yeah, they need to hang out there.

1877
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:35,960
I don't have a problem with them bringing celebrities or even non-celebrities like Paris

1878
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:39,600
Hilton because you know what, that's up to the game publishers how they want to promote

1879
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,220
their game and stuff and if they want to do that, fine.

1880
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:46,340
You don't have to go see it, it's whatever.

1881
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:49,280
I do think though that they have to figure out what the hell they're trying to actually

1882
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,060
accomplish with E3 because the whole thing before was, it's getting crazy because there's

1883
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:56,280
too many people here and we can't get business done.

1884
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:00,020
Well, now that it's more intimate, are you getting business done?

1885
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:04,400
Obviously you're not satisfied the way it is, then what exactly are you trying to accomplish?

1886
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:09,320
I think once they figure that out, you know, maybe, I don't know, let's not take such extremes.

1887
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:14,480
Maybe we just keep it the way it used to be but I don't know, make it slightly more restrictive

1888
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:17,480
on who gets in.

1889
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:23,240
I don't know, it's just, what they need to do is just find a happy medium.

1890
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:33,400
Alright, well, let's move on.

1891
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:41,360
So other EA related news is that EA formed a partnership now with id Software and of

1892
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:48,000
course that also means that their brand new first person shooter title, Rage, is going

1893
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,640
to be published by EA, so that's kind of neat.

1894
01:41:53,640 --> 01:42:02,120
Some other, I wonder if that also includes Doom 4 which got teased, I don't think they

1895
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:09,440
actually announced anything for that, hmm, interesting.

1896
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:16,840
But yet another big company, or big developer I guess to get under their EA belt, hopefully

1897
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,600
do something with it.

1898
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:22,560
Slowly, this big collective is being built even more and more.

1899
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:27,160
You will be assimilated into the big EA.

1900
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:30,560
One thing that's not getting assimilated to EA though, because this is a Konami thing,

1901
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:37,280
this is Gradius Rebirth, this is kind of interesting, it's almost as if Mega Man 9 was just the

1902
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:40,760
beginning because now apparently there's this new Gradius game that's going to be coming

1903
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,640
out for the Wii on WiiWare, I mean no news yet if it's going to come out for Xbox and

1904
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:50,000
PlayStation Network as well like Mega Man 9 is supposed to be, but apparently Gradius

1905
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,080
Rebirth is going to be coming out on the Japanese Wii systems around this summer, probably next

1906
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,600
month or so, but it's apparently what this game is, if it's a remake of Gradius 1 or

1907
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:03,160
if it's a new Gradius game, that quite is not known just yet.

1908
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:06,920
The old school Gradius though is already available on the Virtual Console, so I would think this

1909
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:11,480
is some type of new adventure maybe based on the old Gradius, but you know this is kind

1910
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:14,680
of one of those series that people said they were kind of sad when it died, like there

1911
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:18,320
was the one, there was what, Gradius 5 on the PlayStation 2 and then it kind of disappeared,

1912
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,320
so this is kind of neat.

1913
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:23,080
Jamie, I know you're a big Gradius fan, is this something you're excited about?

1914
01:43:23,080 --> 01:43:24,080
Anything Gradius we get.

1915
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,680
And it even has the Moai heads in it, which is pretty rad.

1916
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,880
You can't have Gradius without Moai heads.

1917
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,240
Absolutely, so that's going to be pretty cool.

1918
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:38,000
Coming out in Japan this summer and I'm imagining America soon enough.

1919
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,360
In other news, I guess sort of related to the Wii, this is actually supposed to go with

1920
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:51,160
my previous story about the status of E3, but Miyamoto is quoted as saying that E3 is

1921
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:57,560
no longer where they're going to be showing off games for the core audience, and we did

1922
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:05,040
mention this earlier in the show, but he said that, he's quoted as saying that for a very

1923
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:10,800
long time E3 was an event where I guess the developers catered specifically to the core

1924
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,840
gamer, so they're actually using it as something to bounce off the mass public, the casual

1925
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:21,200
gamer, their new market that they're trying to get ahold of.

1926
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:28,040
But he said that E3 isn't the right place to point out their classics like Zelda or

1927
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:34,160
their major titles that have been their staple, that the people really, that their fans actually

1928
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,120
care about.

1929
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,520
I don't know about you guys, but hearing this makes me a little bit angsty because it makes

1930
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:44,160
me think of the way E3 used to be, which was actually pretty cool, like the year before

1931
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,880
Paris Hilton showed up.

1932
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:50,360
And when I get angsty, we cue some nasty music and say some nasty things in a segment we

1933
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:55,360
call the F.U. of the Week.

1934
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:10,280
F.U. to the woman who nearly ran into my car on Friday.

1935
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:16,840
I was coming out of the parking lot to turn right onto the road so that I could go back

1936
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:26,120
to work, and this woman turns directly into my car trying to pull into the entrance side

1937
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:32,360
of this little entrance leading back onto the road, and lo and behold, the bitch was

1938
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:34,800
on her phone.

1939
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,560
And Julie and I rolled down the windows and said, hang up your goddamn phone.

1940
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,560
And she looked confused.

1941
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:46,280
And I was like, bitch, if both of your hands had been on the wheel, you could have controlled

1942
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,480
the wheel enough to turn it in all the way.

1943
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,640
It was very clear she was trying to turn the wheel with her hand and her elbow.

1944
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:57,720
Like, bitch, your phone conversation is not worth, you know, risking my life over.

1945
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,920
Hang up your goddamn phone.

1946
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,520
The end.

1947
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:12,680
Anyways, F.U. to stupid people at movie theaters who get there either at the time of the showing

1948
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:19,040
or five minutes prior to it and expect to find a good seat, especially when people have

1949
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:23,000
sat down and have maybe one seat next to them and they want you to move over.

1950
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,000
You know what?

1951
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,360
I didn't get to the movie 50 minutes early, you know, just to have some idiot come right

1952
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:32,400
on time and tell me the move because you don't want to sit up front.

1953
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,400
It's a little tough.

1954
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:34,400
You know what?

1955
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,680
If I got to a movie right as it's starting, then I expect to sit in the front and you

1956
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:37,680
should too.

1957
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,520
So fuck you inconsiderate bitches.

1958
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,920
And she was a fat cow too.

1959
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:45,320
She was playing with her cell phone during the movie.

1960
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,480
What is it with cell phones this week?

1961
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:51,840
My cell, F.U. to my cell phone because I can't get opera mini to work on it anymore.

1962
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,840
So F that.

1963
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:57,040
But my real F.U. is to having to make difficult decisions.

1964
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:01,400
Well, I have two difficult decisions to make in my life right now.

1965
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,640
One is that my doctor is like not sure if I should have a surgery or not and leaving

1966
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:06,640
it up to me.

1967
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:09,760
Like, I'm like, OK, so I get to decide if I have surgery or not.

1968
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:11,680
That's kind of neat, I guess.

1969
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:15,600
So I decide I'm going to go get a second opinion because I can't make decisions by myself.

1970
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:20,240
But the other one is that I've decided I kind of have too many hobbies going on right now.

1971
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:23,400
So I've made a difficult decision that I'm going to be cutting one of them out.

1972
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:24,400
It's not this one.

1973
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,400
Don't worry.

1974
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:32,600
And it's always difficult because that kind of thing usually never gets taken well by

1975
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:35,200
the other people you might be involved with something with.

1976
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,280
And it's going to be difficult.

1977
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,640
And I haven't said anything yet.

1978
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:40,600
So I don't know what I'm going to do.

1979
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,840
But you know, I think people just kind of have to understand, look, I have priorities

1980
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,520
and sadly, you're the lowest priority now.

1981
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,560
So that's what I what's a general way to break that news?

1982
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:54,800
You think that's the best way to do it?

1983
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,520
I got to do what I got to do.

1984
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:59,040
So it's not Warcraft either.

1985
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,040
Sorry.

1986
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:01,040
Oh, I was going to say.

1987
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,040
No, it's not Warcraft.

1988
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,040
No, no, no.

1989
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:04,040
All right.

1990
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,040
It doesn't matter.

1991
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:07,240
It's not the guessing game.

1992
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,720
It's something.

1993
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:13,400
It's something big that I'm going to hate to get away from.

1994
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:15,800
But I have to do it for me.

1995
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,280
I'll tell you later.

1996
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,280
I don't know.

1997
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,280
I couldn't read your lips.

1998
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,280
All right.

1999
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:21,280
All right.

2000
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,280
So that's it for the FUs of the Week.

2001
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:25,360
Other people are quitting WoW.

2002
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,360
I'm not.

2003
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:27,360
I still love WoW.

2004
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:28,360
WoW's great.

2005
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:29,360
But I don't play it every day anymore.

2006
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:31,960
I play it once in a while.

2007
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:36,160
Apparently somebody out there was actually listening to me, or at least thought the same

2008
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:39,280
thing when I saw the movie Wanted.

2009
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:42,680
They are bringing a Wanted game out to the market.

2010
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:46,680
Universal and Grin are working on a Wanted game.

2011
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:52,080
And it will allow you to do all the fun stuff like curbing bullets and going into assassin

2012
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:54,840
time as they call it.

2013
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:58,320
Only sad thing though is it's coming out on Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360.

2014
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:02,400
I was really hoping for a Wii Wanted game because I really think that would be cool.

2015
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,640
Especially with the new Motion Plus.

2016
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:08,840
Now you can attach that to the bottom of your Nyko Perfect Shot and curve the bullets that

2017
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:09,840
way.

2018
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,840
But whatever.

2019
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,240
This will be cool though.

2020
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:14,240
Worth checking out.

2021
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:18,240
Hopefully it will be out around the time when the DVD comes out which is holiday maybe.

2022
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:24,680
But if we're just seeing it now and it hasn't been developed for a while, it could be crap.

2023
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,680
It scares me.

2024
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:31,080
Alright, well one thing I get to look forward to in World of Warcraft since I didn't leave

2025
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:34,400
it is that I'll be getting my own achievements in Warcraft soon.

2026
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:35,400
That's right.

2027
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,400
You know what?

2028
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,840
If Microsoft has put out this achievement thing it's a pretty good thing.

2029
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,360
Other people are going to start stealing things from Microsoft and Blizzard is one of them.

2030
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,360
And it's kind of a neat idea.

2031
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:48,360
They're going to be doing this achievement system and in the game apparently there's

2032
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:53,880
going to be PVP achievements, PvE achievements, achievements for exploring the world, achievements

2033
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,320
for crafting, achievements for questing and developing your character, I mean all these

2034
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,320
different things.

2035
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:01,800
But what I like is that some of the achievements are silly.

2036
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:06,940
There's an achievement that you can unlock for giving 10 hugs to other players.

2037
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:11,820
So if you're just a hug slut you get an achievement for that which is kind of funny I think.

2038
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:16,660
Apparently there are really, really, really difficult achievements as well called feats

2039
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:18,120
of strength.

2040
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,260
So interesting.

2041
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:22,760
I'm assuming this is all going to be able to be tracked on Blizzard's website and the

2042
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:27,980
armory and all that fun stuff too but my question is what about all the stuff I've already done?

2043
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:31,880
Is WoW going to be capable of knowing that I've done all this stuff on my current level

2044
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:32,880
70?

2045
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:33,880
Because that's going to suck if I have to start with a whole new character.

2046
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:37,680
Well that's how they're doing the PlayStation trophies is even if you've done this crap

2047
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:41,040
it's not going to be able to know based on your save game you have to go back and actually

2048
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,040
do it again.

2049
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:43,040
Right, right.

2050
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,880
You know other websites have, was I going to say Newgrounds kind of does something similar

2051
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,760
with their flash games.

2052
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,760
Actually all the flash games have kind of trophies built into it and stuff.

2053
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:58,520
So that's kind of neat that they do that too and you know I think WoW doing it, it's a

2054
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:02,160
great idea especially if they do it right and hopefully some of these other publishers

2055
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:07,960
out there that are making Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games take note of this and actually do

2056
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:12,100
the achievements correct instead of just beat level one, beat level two.

2057
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:16,120
Make them fun, make them different.

2058
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:19,560
Alrighty, very cool.

2059
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:27,300
Well something else that's fairly cool and this actually has to do with Silent Hill Homecoming.

2060
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:34,080
They were actually showing that there will be our good buddy with the Red Pyramid hanging

2061
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:41,740
out in part of Silent Hill Homecoming and that it's going to have a PC version.

2062
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:45,280
So that's pretty cool.

2063
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:48,380
Just like I guess the ones before it except for the very first one.

2064
01:51:48,380 --> 01:51:50,040
But that's pretty cool information.

2065
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:54,960
I mean he would have to be, because I mean my whole problem with having Pyramid Head

2066
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:59,900
in the movie even as cool as it was, was that he was supposed to be like a part of the main

2067
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:05,720
character psychosis and I doubt that she has anything about the lady in the movie had anything

2068
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,480
about sadomasochism so I don't know.

2069
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:14,360
But maybe this guy does, the main protagonist of Silent Hill Homecoming, Alex Shepard.

2070
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:18,040
I was actually going to ask you about that.

2071
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:23,520
Are you going to forgive it for kind of maybe bending the lore in Silent Hill to give the

2072
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,760
fanservice of having Red Pyramid, Pyramid Head, whatever in the game?

2073
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:31,720
We did have some reoccurring critters, you know, certain same types of things.

2074
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,720
Like the nurses.

2075
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:33,720
The nurses.

2076
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,720
Yeah, the nurses.

2077
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:40,560
But I mean I think that maybe it's just that if they're going to do it this way then I

2078
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:45,440
think that maybe that's just how the town manifests that certain feeling or something,

2079
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,520
that certain part of someone's psyche.

2080
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:49,080
As long as he rapes things.

2081
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:55,320
We got Pyramid Head, for those who don't know, he goes around having his way with the female

2082
01:52:55,320 --> 01:53:02,440
creatures of the town of Silent Hill, including the double-sided mannequins and the nurses,

2083
01:53:02,440 --> 01:53:06,560
and then he goes around stabbing random women who keep regenerating.

2084
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,480
I need to watch the Silent Hill movie again.

2085
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,480
God, it was great.

2086
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,720
Come over to my house, we'll watch it.

2087
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,040
Seriously, I want to watch it on Blu-ray.

2088
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:13,040
I bet it's pretty.

2089
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:14,040
I need to get it.

2090
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:15,040
You don't have it on Blu-ray.

2091
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,040
No, I want it.

2092
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,040
And my husband's a butthole.

2093
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,040
He did it on Blu-ray, maybe he still has it.

2094
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,360
Didn't we watch it on Blu-ray once?

2095
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:22,920
I mean, I love my husband very much, he's not always a butthole.

2096
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,800
We did it at your apartment, your old apartment.

2097
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,120
I don't think we watched the whole thing.

2098
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:27,120
Yeah.

2099
01:53:27,120 --> 01:53:28,120
You can bring it over.

2100
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:30,820
But I've got, like, the humongoly TV.

2101
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:33,720
We need Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Night.

2102
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,840
Okay.

2103
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:36,840
Maybe that should be a holiday.

2104
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:37,840
I hear the rabbit-

2105
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,960
An official holiday on Orange Mounds Radio.

2106
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:40,960
I hear the Creepy-

2107
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:46,360
Was it the Creepy Rabbits from number two, I think, or back at school?

2108
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:49,020
We have to also have nurses, we have to have nurses.

2109
01:53:49,020 --> 01:53:51,240
And I want the screaming things.

2110
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:56,000
I would ask the chat room, what day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?

2111
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,800
Not Halloween, that's too obvious, some other day.

2112
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:02,320
What day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?

2113
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,320
So we'll see.

2114
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:04,320
Tuesday.

2115
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,320
September 12th.

2116
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:06,320
Why is that?

2117
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,320
I don't know.

2118
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:08,320
The day after your birthday?

2119
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:12,320
Well, you could do it, how would the release date of Silent Hill Homecoming-

2120
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:13,320
Oh, there you go.

2121
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:14,320
Or the day before.

2122
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,760
What was the day that Silent Hill 2 came out?

2123
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,700
I don't know, I'll have to look that up.

2124
01:54:17,700 --> 01:54:19,480
That should be Pyramid Head-

2125
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:22,600
I will look that up and we will dub that Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

2126
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:25,400
I will look that up right now while we get into another story.

2127
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:26,400
Awesome.

2128
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:31,040
Well, this is kind of weird and it may not actually be a confirmation at all, but apparently

2129
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:37,960
there is some people that performed some sort of social engineering prank that had 2K games

2130
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:45,080
support believing that there is a hacked version of Grand Theft Auto IV's PC version, at least

2131
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,760
a demo of it, on a pirate site.

2132
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:54,400
And apparently there was some back and forth going on with the tech support to which they

2133
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:59,560
replied with, the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV has not even been announced for release

2134
01:54:59,560 --> 01:55:08,480
and is still in development, so it's not about to be released on a website.

2135
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:11,480
People are reading into that thinking, well it's still in development, well that kind

2136
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:14,000
of confirms that it's actually coming out.

2137
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:20,400
But the whole thing is does really their tech support know anything about games in development?

2138
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:21,400
I don't know.

2139
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:22,400
Maybe.

2140
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:26,960
I mean, I would think it would be kind of dumb if they didn't put out a PC version.

2141
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:35,240
And I know the last few PlayStation 2 games have been on PC, so why not?

2142
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:37,560
So maybe it's coming, just might take some time.

2143
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:41,940
Alright, and I'm sure that makes a lot of people very happy, especially because PC means

2144
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,440
easily hackable.

2145
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:44,440
Exactly.

2146
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:45,440
It means mod crazy.

2147
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,440
Mod crazy.

2148
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,440
Alright, here we go.

2149
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,440
Here's the answer to the question.

2150
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:49,440
We did the research.

2151
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,680
The Silent Hill 2 was released in North America.

2152
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,360
Believe it or not, North America got it first.

2153
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:55,280
Japan got it three days later.

2154
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,840
September 24th, 2001.

2155
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:59,640
Too bad it's not the 23rd.

2156
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:00,640
You know, it's funny.

2157
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:07,320
September 24th, I think, is very close, if not the exact release date of Homecoming.

2158
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,320
Interesting.

2159
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,080
Well, there you have it.

2160
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,080
So I guess that's it.

2161
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:12,080
So do we officially...

2162
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:16,160
No, September 24th is a Wednesday this year, so it might be like September 23rd, or that

2163
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:18,040
might be the day you actually can get it in a store.

2164
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:21,360
If it's the 23rd, then we have the number of consequence.

2165
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,560
24th can be a release date.

2166
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:25,080
Games mostly come out on Wednesdays.

2167
01:56:25,080 --> 01:56:26,080
Alright, fair enough.

2168
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:27,080
It's like a street date.

2169
01:56:27,080 --> 01:56:29,240
I mean, they have a ship date, but you know.

2170
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,240
Whatever.

2171
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,240
I think we...

2172
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:32,240
But we have the official word.

2173
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:35,040
September 24th is Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

2174
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,040
Official.

2175
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:37,040
Done.

2176
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,040
Done deal.

2177
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,040
Get the wax.

2178
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,320
Let's get the seal, the OLR seal.

2179
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:44,120
That's in our new universe of Orange Loungia.

2180
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,120
Alright.

2181
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:46,120
So...

2182
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:50,120
I like that, Orange Loungia.

2183
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:53,960
How should people celebrate Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day?

2184
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:58,980
You can't tell them to rape things, because unfortunately, rape is not funny.

2185
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:03,280
You can just have them put on a big cardboard pyramid on their head, and walk around with

2186
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:06,600
like, since it's really hard to find a great knife like that, walk around with a plastic

2187
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,600
knife.

2188
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,640
Walk around the neighborhood and threaten the cats.

2189
01:57:09,640 --> 01:57:10,640
In your neighborhood.

2190
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:11,640
You have to have a plastic knife.

2191
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:12,920
You have to have a plastic knife.

2192
01:57:12,920 --> 01:57:14,160
And take pictures.

2193
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,360
Bake Pyramid Head cakes.

2194
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:16,360
Yes!

2195
01:57:16,360 --> 01:57:17,360
Bake Pyramid Head cakes.

2196
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:22,320
Pyramid Head cupcakes, and pass them out to the neighbors, and they have to be red velvet.

2197
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,320
Alright.

2198
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:25,880
So we want pictures of you celebrating Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

2199
01:57:25,880 --> 01:57:26,880
And the best...

2200
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:27,880
This year.

2201
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,880
The best cupcake wins.

2202
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:29,880
Something.

2203
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:34,200
Wins eaten by the hosts.

2204
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,200
You know what would be awesome?

2205
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:36,200
What?

2206
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:37,200
If we had a lot of money.

2207
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:38,200
I mean, a lot, a lot of money.

2208
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:39,200
What?

2209
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:42,960
We'd love to have the cakes to build you a sculpture of Pyramid Head as a cake.

2210
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:43,960
Great.

2211
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,440
I have a friend that makes wedding cakes.

2212
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:46,440
I'll have to see.

2213
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:47,680
That wouldn't be too bad.

2214
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:51,400
Sharan in chat says, can I wear my pyramid shaped tin foil hat instead?

2215
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:52,400
You certainly can.

2216
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,400
But we want pictures.

2217
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,400
Celebrate in whatever way possible.

2218
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,400
I like that.

2219
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:56,960
Pyramid shaped cupcakes.

2220
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,960
You could do that.

2221
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,040
I mean, just kind of take a cupcake and kind of either...

2222
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,040
Tin foil.

2223
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,040
You know.

2224
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:03,040
You can make your own mold.

2225
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,040
But no, seriously, contest.

2226
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:06,040
Dun dun dun.

2227
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:07,040
And the rules are...

2228
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:08,040
Just a ways out.

2229
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:10,800
The rules are whatever we decide they are at the time.

2230
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:15,480
One of them is a costume contest for your best, not necessarily cosplay, but just your

2231
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:17,360
best celebration of Pyramid Head.

2232
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,880
And the second one is how pretty your cupcakes are.

2233
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:20,880
I don't know if they'll have...

2234
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:21,880
I don't know if Pyramid...

2235
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:22,880
Send us pictures.

2236
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,440
Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day is that PC.

2237
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:26,440
I mean...

2238
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,440
Who cares?

2239
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,640
I think some people, maybe rape victims might be offended by that.

2240
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,640
You know?

2241
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:32,640
Yeah.

2242
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:33,640
I know.

2243
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:34,640
We might be offending some people.

2244
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,640
Okay.

2245
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:36,640
It's just Red Pyramid Day.

2246
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:37,640
Or Pyramid Head Appreciation Day would be fine.

2247
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:38,640
It's funny.

2248
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:39,640
Rape of people is not funny.

2249
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:40,640
No.

2250
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:41,640
Rape of monsters...

2251
01:58:41,640 --> 01:58:42,640
Is.

2252
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:43,640
Funny.

2253
01:58:43,640 --> 01:58:44,640
Because monsters are bad.

2254
01:58:44,640 --> 01:58:45,640
And when bad people...

2255
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:46,640
Bob.

2256
01:58:46,640 --> 01:58:47,640
What?

2257
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:48,640
I'm just not gonna keep going.

2258
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,640
Let go of the shovel.

2259
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:50,640
I'm gonna...

2260
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:51,640
Yeah.

2261
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:52,640
I'm digging myself a hole.

2262
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,640
Okay.

2263
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:54,640
How about...

2264
01:58:54,640 --> 01:58:55,640
What?

2265
01:58:55,640 --> 01:58:56,640
Pyramid Head Day.

2266
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:57,640
I still like Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

2267
01:58:57,640 --> 01:58:58,640
But only when you rape monsters.

2268
01:58:58,640 --> 01:58:59,640
How about the Rape Appreciation Event?

2269
01:58:59,640 --> 01:59:00,640
You know what they should do?

2270
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:02,640
We should have a rape carnival.

2271
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:03,640
That'd be cool.

2272
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:08,640
Is the mold your own custom, like... or... I can see the hate mail coming from a mile

2273
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:09,640
away.

2274
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:14,440
We should mold our, like, custom, like, gummy candy, like, molds and make, like, gummy red

2275
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,440
pyramid heads.

2276
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:16,440
We need your ideas of how to...

2277
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:17,760
We're gonna make pyramid cakes.

2278
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:21,840
We need your ideas of how to turn this into a politically correct event.

2279
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,840
There's no way, Rob.

2280
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:23,840
All right.

2281
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:31,320
Um, Shaoran says, uh, I'm offended some of my best friends are monsters, you asshole.

2282
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:35,160
And no, Joshi16, there will not be a rape-a-thon this part of the day.

2283
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,160
This is horrible.

2284
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,160
No, no, no.

2285
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,160
No, it's gonna be...

2286
01:59:38,160 --> 01:59:39,760
It's gonna be Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.

2287
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,760
All right.

2288
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:42,920
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

2289
01:59:42,920 --> 01:59:43,920
Okay.

2290
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,560
Anyhow, in a completely different topic, I'm sure there'll be a lot of appreciation for

2291
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:48,560
this as well.

2292
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,080
It has been announced that BioWare and LucasArts, they are building the MMO for Knights of the

2293
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:54,080
Old Republic.

2294
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,520
Now, this is different from the existing Star Wars MMO, but there is that new Knights of

2295
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:00,200
the Old Republic MMO that's gonna be going on.

2296
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:07,040
It's pretty cool, and you can see this whole thing that's post, I guess it's on portfolio.com,

2297
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,200
and it has been confirmed.

2298
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,320
This is Knights of the Round, I'm sorry, Knights of the Round Republic.

2299
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:12,600
That would be awesome.

2300
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:14,520
Knights of the Round, the old Capcom game.

2301
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:17,280
Knights of the Old Republic is online.

2302
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,000
It's Knights of the Old Old Republic.

2303
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,600
Shut up.

2304
02:00:20,600 --> 02:00:24,400
I cannot think of KOTOR without thinking of my friend who tested it and what they called

2305
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,400
it in office.

2306
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:26,400
What's that?

2307
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:27,400
Scrotor.

2308
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,400
Nice.

2309
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:29,400
Very nice.

2310
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,680
So, there you have it.

2311
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,400
That game will be coming probably in a couple years.

2312
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,040
It's probably still a little ways out, but I'm sure there's lots of people that are waiting

2313
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,240
to ditch WoW for that.

2314
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,840
It'll be good times.

2315
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:39,840
Alright.

2316
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:44,680
Anyhow, we're gonna get into another segment here on Orange Launch Radio that's good times,

2317
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:46,520
because it's the chance for us to hear from the listeners.

2318
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:48,240
It's the mailbag segment.

2319
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:53,120
Every week we invite your emails at mailbagorangelaunchradio.com, and let's read some of those emails right

2320
02:00:53,120 --> 02:01:00,800
now.

2321
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:01,800
Emails!

2322
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:02,800
We have some.

2323
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,800
The end.

2324
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:04,800
Wait, can I jump in here?

2325
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:05,800
Because there's a great idea from us if we're in chat.

2326
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:06,800
Well.

2327
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:07,800
Pyramid Hat Appreciation Day.

2328
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:12,040
The day that people across the world wear pyramid hats and rip skin off their fried

2329
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:15,440
chicken.

2330
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,960
So it's ripping skin off chicks?

2331
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:20,280
Yeah, but it's chicken.

2332
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:21,680
So that way it's politically correct.

2333
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:26,080
Well, I think we're- I think ossifers set a good, like, starting point.

2334
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:28,160
I think there's a good idea in there somewhere.

2335
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,160
Anyway.

2336
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,160
Sorry.

2337
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:31,160
Mail.

2338
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:32,160
Yeah.

2339
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:33,160
Um.

2340
02:01:33,160 --> 02:01:34,160
From Robwith2bees.

2341
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:38,920
A dear two guys, a girl, and an Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salad and breadsticks.

2342
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:41,880
Is it me, or is the news from E3 much more boring this year?

2343
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:47,920
One of the things that was, um, new, we moats shouldn't add on that more accurately judges

2344
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:50,160
the controller's aspect.

2345
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:53,680
Can this more or less throw out to your old plastic thingies?

2346
02:01:53,680 --> 02:01:58,480
Um, it won't fit onto the zapper, so maybe you won't need it for older games, but there

2347
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,200
will have to be a new zapper.

2348
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,720
Are two zappers truly better than one?

2349
02:02:03,720 --> 02:02:05,720
No.

2350
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:10,920
Or you can buy the Nyko Perfect Shot and then slap it into the pass-through in the bottom.

2351
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:14,480
Not that both games will probably be using the thing at the same time.

2352
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:18,920
Or you could just save yourself the money and not buy a zapper because they're shit.

2353
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:21,720
I actually don't agree that E3 was necessarily disappointing.

2354
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:22,720
I think especially at my-

2355
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:24,120
I think boring was the word.

2356
02:02:24,120 --> 02:02:27,160
I think at Microsoft's camp, I think they did just fine.

2357
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:30,600
I mean, you knew that nobody was going to be announcing a new system this year, and

2358
02:02:30,600 --> 02:02:34,440
I think the only thing that made Microsoft's press conference a little bit, um, we knew

2359
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:36,800
that was coming was because of the leak that had already happened.

2360
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:40,120
I think if you hadn't known about the avatars in advance, uh, I think it would have been

2361
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:43,040
a pretty big deal to see that new dashboard for the first time.

2362
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,040
Um.

2363
02:02:44,040 --> 02:02:47,160
And even still, we didn't know that the new dashboard was coming, we just knew that avatars

2364
02:02:47,160 --> 02:02:48,160
are coming.

2365
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:52,760
And the other thing, too, is I like the format of the new E3, um, you know, with all the

2366
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:57,000
press conferences because it's very much like gamer's days, and I think it's a lot easier

2367
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,840
to digest the information, unless of course you're, you know, doing Capcom's press conference

2368
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:06,560
where all they did was talk about the fucking, you know, Lost Planet movie, but, you know,

2369
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:08,440
no information out of that.

2370
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,440
Um.

2371
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:16,640
But I like the old show, no, show floor of the original E3, so if we can kind of do both,

2372
02:03:16,640 --> 02:03:17,640
that'd be awesome.

2373
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,640
We'll see.

2374
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:23,720
Well, you notice that when we went to press events, um, our last year of going, they were

2375
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:29,400
sort of off in those little rooms, where they had the little trailer area set up inside

2376
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,920
the, uh, the show floor.

2377
02:03:31,920 --> 02:03:34,520
I loved it, though, when we got to go to Bethesda's thing, that was great.

2378
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:36,480
I loved Bethesda's area, and they were so nice.

2379
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,160
It was just because it was just chill.

2380
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:40,600
And I really actually liked, um, Play and See.

2381
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:41,600
Yeah.

2382
02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:42,600
I really liked it.

2383
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,560
Everybody that let us in, I think, I just, yeah, I just distinctly remember Bethesda

2384
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:47,840
because they had a lot of stuff I was kind of interested in at the time.

2385
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,840
Um, but.

2386
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:50,040
Call of Cthulhu.

2387
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:51,040
Where's that?

2388
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:54,840
It just, I think any company, you know, even at the old E3, you know, kind of getting off

2389
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:58,360
the main floor into those little back rooms and stuff was, was kind of neat.

2390
02:03:58,360 --> 02:04:01,600
Call of Cthulhu came out in 2005 on the Xbox.

2391
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:03,280
I completely missed it.

2392
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:06,000
Well, I don't think anyone missed it.

2393
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,960
I remember being so excited, and then I never heard anything about it, so.

2394
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:16,920
Well, to make it up, there is a new Call of, or a new Cthulhu movie coming out that stars

2395
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:17,920
Tori Spelling.

2396
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:23,520
Unfortunately not as Cthulhu, but, you know.

2397
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,520
And she has a small part.

2398
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:27,040
Oh, okay, so she's just a cameo.

2399
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,040
Maybe she dies really well.

2400
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,040
Anyway.

2401
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:32,040
Maybe she's a Cthulhu, I don't know.

2402
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:33,040
Cthulhu.

2403
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:42,480
Anyway, Uber email, really long, and this comes from GS191.

2404
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:45,480
And it's really long.

2405
02:04:45,480 --> 02:04:47,320
Read the first two paragraphs or something.

2406
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:49,080
Um, well, it's really long.

2407
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:53,280
Um, hello there, it's been a while since I've written anything to you all.

2408
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:56,640
Nevertheless, I am still an avid listener of the show, even though I haven't been able

2409
02:04:56,640 --> 02:04:58,560
to be in the chat room in quite a while.

2410
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:02,000
You can blame my World of Warcraft guild and them pushing me to level my Gnome Mage to

2411
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,720
70 so they can get another crowd controller in the group.

2412
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:05,720
Go figure.

2413
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:11,280
Anyway, after sitting through all the big three E3 press conferences, piss conferences,

2414
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:14,280
I do have some choice words about all of them.

2415
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:18,880
By the way, I have to give many grats to G4 for showing all of the E3 press conferences

2416
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:21,040
for the big three with no commercials.

2417
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:27,160
I must say, it was quite nice to see them on a 50 inch plasma TV, but standard definition

2418
02:05:27,160 --> 02:05:28,400
for the lose.

2419
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:30,400
To be honest, it would be better just to stream them.

2420
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:35,680
I heard that they cut away for the Final Fantasy 13 announcement to show the audience, instead

2421
02:05:35,680 --> 02:05:39,760
of, you know, viewing the wonderful trailer for Final Fantasy 13.

2422
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,640
They actually had to, because there was a little thing that came up on the screen, I

2423
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:45,440
don't know if you saw it, it got leaked out somewhere, there was a little thing on the

2424
02:05:45,440 --> 02:05:48,340
screen that said, please do not videotape the following trailer.

2425
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:49,340
So I think they had to.

2426
02:05:49,340 --> 02:05:50,340
You may not...

2427
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:51,600
Yep, there is video footage of it.

2428
02:05:51,600 --> 02:05:55,520
That was, well that was Square's thing, not G4's probably.

2429
02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:05,880
Well, just in general, from what I'm seeing about the Microsoft one, is that, I guess

2430
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:11,720
he seems pretty happy about Fallout 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, saying

2431
02:06:11,720 --> 02:06:15,920
that they did a good job showing it and being excited about Final Fantasy 13.

2432
02:06:15,920 --> 02:06:23,880
I'm actually going to post this email also in our forum, so I'll put a link to it in

2433
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,920
the chatroom later on.

2434
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:29,240
But it's a fairly lengthy email, but I think it makes some very, very good points.

2435
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:36,200
And of course, Sony's having their demo of Resistance 2 and LittleBigPlanet demo and

2436
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,200
that type of stuff.

2437
02:06:37,200 --> 02:06:44,520
So I'm going to be actually posting this in its entirety on the forum, so, in a minute.

2438
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:45,520
Awesome.

2439
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:46,520
It is really long.

2440
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:51,440
Hey, Ossofer's building on the idea, you want to hear the, now this could be for the Pyramid

2441
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,120
Head Carnival, okay?

2442
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:58,800
Opening events for the Pyramid Head Appreciation Day, Spin the Pyramid, Silent Hillopoly, Sorry,

2443
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:03,600
You Got Raped, and Twisted Pyramid, Twister but in more compromised positions.

2444
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,880
I do, though, have to read the closure to his letter.

2445
02:07:06,880 --> 02:07:07,880
What's that?

2446
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:12,040
It's from MichaelGS191, this email is brought to you by the never-ending disappointment

2447
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:15,460
that is Nintendo, where's my fucking Star Fox remake for the Wii?

2448
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:18,920
Or F-Zero, get in line.

2449
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:21,820
Well, continuing on, shall I?

2450
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:22,820
You shall.

2451
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:25,160
Another email adventures.

2452
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:26,680
This is actually from Sauce.

2453
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,440
Hey guys, gals, and ferrets.

2454
02:07:29,440 --> 02:07:32,080
Wait, wait, wait, where's the ferret?

2455
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,080
The question, where's the ferret?

2456
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:35,400
You had the ferret earlier, you were- The ferret was snuggling in my boobs.

2457
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:36,400
I see.

2458
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:38,800
Is that how you lost it?

2459
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:41,760
No, I was actually sitting on it.

2460
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:46,040
I come bearing another video game review to add to the OLR collection, this time the game

2461
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,680
of choice's God of War, Chains of Olympus.

2462
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:52,400
I'm including a link to the review for the chat room's reading pleasure, which I will

2463
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:54,320
link in the chat room momentarily.

2464
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:58,360
The short version of the review is that Chains of Olympus is a fun, non-stop, action-packed

2465
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:03,260
game worth playing for any God of War fan, or any fan of hack and slash violence.

2466
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:06,120
It has excellent graphics and sound, and is definitely worth the play.

2467
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:11,480
Anyone interested in keeping up with my video game reviews or articles about comics and

2468
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:15,960
movies, as are the three industries, are very much tied into one another, can follow me

2469
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:20,580
on Twitter, under Marin Marvel, for updates.

2470
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:24,400
Keep up the good job, OLR, maybe someday Skye and I will rock the boat and you'll see the

2471
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,760
reviews on the OLR website, winky face.

2472
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:27,760
Someday.

2473
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:28,760
Sincerely, Marin.

2474
02:08:28,760 --> 02:08:31,240
I'm gonna link it in the chat room in just a sec.

2475
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:33,480
Yes, I need to read it still.

2476
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:34,480
I'm kind of curious.

2477
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:38,000
I'm curious to hear what she thinks of it, because I don't know if she's a huge God of

2478
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,120
War fan, so I'm kind of curious what she thinks of the PSP one.

2479
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:42,840
So we'll see.

2480
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:46,000
The chat room has now been officially linked.

2481
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,580
Dun dun dun.

2482
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:49,520
So last email.

2483
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,520
Which came very last minute.

2484
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:55,560
Also, Rob2b sent me other emails, but I'm going to save those for being related to last

2485
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:56,560
minute story stuff.

2486
02:08:56,560 --> 02:08:58,120
They're pretty cool things.

2487
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:59,600
Hey, OLR.

2488
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,960
I got the orange box for PS3 a couple of days ago.

2489
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:04,600
I can't believe I waited so long for such a great game.

2490
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:07,540
Even though I haven't played the original Half-Life, the story is still pretty easy

2491
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:08,540
to follow.

2492
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:09,540
Excuse me.

2493
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:13,560
And it's kind of fun to guess what happened before, plus it looks amazing.

2494
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:17,920
Portal also made me smile at the sly remarks, but I have to say, playing the Flash game

2495
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:21,680
first makes the first bunch of levels much easier.

2496
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:23,920
If anyone hasn't picked it up yet, do so immediately.

2497
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:30,200
Preferably not now, but maybe tomorrow during AGI, since you won't miss the whole show.

2498
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:34,360
Miss a whole lot in the 20 minutes it takes to get it.

2499
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:39,360
I'm listening to this show right now, and I hope that- let me start over- I hope I can

2500
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:41,000
get Skype to work this time.

2501
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:42,800
Anyway, I look forward to the show.

2502
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:43,880
Thanks for reading this email.

2503
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:48,040
If you don't read this email, then I guess there's no point in me thanking you, so if

2504
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:50,120
you don't, no thanks.

2505
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:52,500
Sincerely, pkgr92.

2506
02:09:52,500 --> 02:09:56,160
This email is sponsored by everything and everyone else not yet mentioned, so now if

2507
02:09:56,160 --> 02:10:00,280
you sign your emails, you'll be pirating my right to beat that.

2508
02:10:00,280 --> 02:10:02,760
Alrighty then.

2509
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:03,760
It's dot com.

2510
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,760
Is that it?

2511
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:06,760
Yes.

2512
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:08,560
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

2513
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,320
Email us some stuff.

2514
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:13,460
Try to not make it so epic though, because then we'd have- you know, we don't have time

2515
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:15,320
to read it on air, so we have to post it in the forums.

2516
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:18,920
Not that that's a bad thing, but you know, keep it concise.

2517
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:23,040
We like concise emails.

2518
02:10:23,040 --> 02:10:25,600
Moving on with some gaming news, right Logie?

2519
02:10:25,600 --> 02:10:26,600
Yes.

2520
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:28,200
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

2521
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:33,500
There's been some more details unveiled about the game, including that it will have 20 plus

2522
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:36,880
characters and download content as well.

2523
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:42,920
Of course, they didn't really say too much else other than they were going to be kind

2524
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:46,880
of splitting up the roster with, you know, DC and Mortal Kombat characters.

2525
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:53,040
There's also fatalities or brutalities, I guess, for the villains that are going to

2526
02:10:53,040 --> 02:10:54,680
be in it.

2527
02:10:54,680 --> 02:10:59,360
So if you're playing as DC villains, you can kill people, but the DC heroes will not be

2528
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:00,360
able to kill people.

2529
02:11:00,360 --> 02:11:03,200
They'll just only maim.

2530
02:11:03,200 --> 02:11:04,200
I think.

2531
02:11:04,200 --> 02:11:05,200
No.

2532
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:06,320
It depends which Batman we're getting.

2533
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,080
Adam West's Batman never really killed anyone.

2534
02:11:08,080 --> 02:11:09,320
Wonder Woman killed someone.

2535
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:11,080
With their bare hands.

2536
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:15,440
Actually, I do believe that Adam West should be in this game.

2537
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:18,000
That would sell it for me, but.

2538
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,560
Oh well.

2539
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:21,240
Adam West's Batman should totally be in this game.

2540
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:24,200
Either way, I can expect this game in November.

2541
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:25,360
Cool.

2542
02:11:25,360 --> 02:11:32,240
Well, Harmonix has given us a few details, this E3, about the Rock Band 1 compatibility

2543
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,520
in Rock Band 2.

2544
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:37,960
Of course, Rock Band 2 is a game that caught a lot of people's attention at E3 this year,

2545
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:40,960
and it's already kind of sneaking out there.

2546
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:44,160
They showed the game at some side parties that were held and things, which sounds kind

2547
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:45,160
of cool.

2548
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:47,280
And one of the rumors out there was that you were going to be able to have all your Rock

2549
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:52,960
Band 1 tracks in Rock Band 2, and it turns out, true statement.

2550
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:58,760
Apparently what happens is that you're not going to be able to transfer all the songs,

2551
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:01,520
because apparently there's some licensing things going on.

2552
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,360
They basically have to re-license every song in Rock Band 1 for Rock Band 2.

2553
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:09,960
They are saying, though, it's only supposed to be a couple songs that don't come over.

2554
02:12:09,960 --> 02:12:15,080
And some people are thinking perhaps the Aerosmith song can't come over because of the whole

2555
02:12:15,080 --> 02:12:17,880
fact that Guitar Hero owns their soul now.

2556
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:21,000
But hopefully only a couple songs miss the boat.

2557
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:25,080
Apparently though, you are going to have to pay a small fee, maybe like a $5 fee, to transfer

2558
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:26,080
the songs over.

2559
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:30,880
But I still think it's kind of neat, because man, if you add 60 songs from Rock Band 1

2560
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:35,380
or however many they end up having, and then your download tracks and the Rock Band 2,

2561
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:37,560
that's a lot of freaking songs.

2562
02:12:37,560 --> 02:12:41,640
Seriously, a lot of freaking songs.

2563
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:45,160
So there you have it.

2564
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:50,200
Rock Band 2 songs and Rock Band 1 songs together in one roof.

2565
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:51,200
Amazing.

2566
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:52,720
That's how they should be doing it.

2567
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:58,840
Well, in other news, there is a date out for Play TV, something that's going to record

2568
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:02,300
your TV shows while you're gaming.

2569
02:13:02,300 --> 02:13:08,720
It's coming out in Europe from September to December, the first release date being the

2570
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:11,080
10th of September for the UK.

2571
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:17,760
It's a DVR that adds on to the PlayStation 3, so you can use it while you're playing

2572
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:23,280
something that you just happen to really be into to record whatever show that happens

2573
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:30,040
to be coming on while you're busy killing people in your game.

2574
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:35,840
Kudos for them for making an add-on for the PS3, but isn't that just a VCR?

2575
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:36,840
I mean...

2576
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:37,840
It's TiVo.

2577
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:40,820
But you can still record, I mean, if you're playing a video game, you can still record

2578
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:45,140
stuff on your TV, you just have it record off of a different channel.

2579
02:13:45,140 --> 02:13:49,120
It's just like, remember how with the old VCR, you could watch one show while you're

2580
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:50,120
recording another?

2581
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,120
I don't know.

2582
02:13:51,120 --> 02:13:52,120
It's just...

2583
02:13:52,120 --> 02:13:53,120
Well, hey.

2584
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:54,120
It's TiVo.

2585
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:56,320
If it fills your need, I guess, you know.

2586
02:13:56,320 --> 02:14:03,160
We've also got release dates for Australia and New Zealand around February or January.

2587
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:04,160
So...

2588
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:05,160
Okay.

2589
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,160
Anyways...

2590
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:09,360
We're having fun network issues in-house again.

2591
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:10,360
Fun fun!

2592
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:13,680
Live listeners are noticing that Justin TV went down again, and I think we're just gonna

2593
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:15,440
pull the plug on that for the night.

2594
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:16,440
Bye-bye.

2595
02:14:16,440 --> 02:14:21,600
Sorry, but we don't know how else to fix our network issues, and usually JTV is the first

2596
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,600
thing that has to go.

2597
02:14:22,600 --> 02:14:23,600
Sorry.

2598
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:24,600
Because really, do you really want to watch people just talking?

2599
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:25,600
I know.

2600
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:30,760
I guess people like Justin TV because there's not as much lag, and that they can hear the

2601
02:14:30,760 --> 02:14:33,840
things that go on during the break time, and that...

2602
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,480
I guess the sound's better, but I don't believe that.

2603
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:38,760
The sound's crystal clear on all games, so I don't get that.

2604
02:14:38,760 --> 02:14:41,080
Well, my network just came back up, so...

2605
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:42,080
Yeah.

2606
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:43,080
So, just kill Justin TV for the night.

2607
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,080
Sorry, guys.

2608
02:14:44,080 --> 02:14:45,080
Alrighty.

2609
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:50,000
Now it's fun naked time, so, haha, you missed out, Justin TV.

2610
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,680
Anyways, I'm taking my pants off right now.

2611
02:14:53,680 --> 02:14:57,480
First, going wild!

2612
02:14:57,480 --> 02:15:04,800
So Guitar Hero On Tour, surprise, is getting a sequel called On Tour Decades.

2613
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:11,040
And I guess the first game sold just over a third of a million, with 350,000 units sold

2614
02:15:11,040 --> 02:15:18,640
in three weeks, and the sequel, no word on exactly when it's coming out.

2615
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:22,820
There is rumors, though, that there might be some form of microphone functionality,

2616
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:26,000
maybe karaoke.

2617
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,160
I don't know.

2618
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:30,440
No word, though, when it's coming out, so...

2619
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:34,320
Big surprise, a DS sequel, or a sequel for a Guitar Hero game.

2620
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:38,780
I mean, hey, they wouldn't want to leave, you know, the DS out with 50 billion releases

2621
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:39,780
each year.

2622
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:40,780
Who knew?

2623
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:41,780
Never.

2624
02:15:41,780 --> 02:15:45,800
Alright, well, one more story for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line

2625
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:52,080
for you guys, a 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, and, look, we

2626
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:56,040
saved the best E3 announcement for last.

2627
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:57,040
Here's the thing.

2628
02:15:57,040 --> 02:16:02,320
A new game was announced by Ubisoft at E3, and the game, Jamie, you're gonna be very

2629
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:03,360
excited about this game.

2630
02:16:03,360 --> 02:16:06,680
You know what, all those network woes, you're not even gonna think about that because you're

2631
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:08,560
gonna be so excited about this game.

2632
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:11,960
It's called Baby's Party.

2633
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:17,240
It's basically Imagine Baby's the party game.

2634
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:22,240
It's coming out this autumn, and apparently you actually use the balance board in the

2635
02:16:22,240 --> 02:16:23,240
game.

2636
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:27,880
You actually play this at a babysitting academy, and there's 30 minigames in the game.

2637
02:16:27,880 --> 02:16:33,620
It's head-to-head, co-op mode, both games, or both methods are available, and it's based

2638
02:16:33,620 --> 02:16:36,600
on the typical day of a baby.

2639
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:37,600
I don't...

2640
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,600
What?

2641
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:39,600
Eat, sleep, poop, cry?

2642
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:43,880
I know, I can't think of 30 things that a baby actually does in a day, but there you

2643
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:44,880
have it.

2644
02:16:44,880 --> 02:16:45,880
What was the old...

2645
02:16:45,880 --> 02:16:46,880
Baby fart?

2646
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:47,880
Can they blow up?

2647
02:16:47,880 --> 02:16:51,720
No, the babies can't even really fart by themselves, like the burping...

2648
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:55,800
They can burp, they just need help.

2649
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:59,600
What was the game they used to have at Milpitas Golf Land, with the big buttons that was like

2650
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:00,920
the babies racing?

2651
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:06,560
Oh, they had that at the game, the convention too.

2652
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,560
It was...

2653
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:08,560
The hell was that?

2654
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,560
Bye Bye Baby...

2655
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:10,560
No.

2656
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:11,560
Bye Bye Baby something?

2657
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,960
Yeah, it was some like baby racing game.

2658
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,960
Come on baby, says AJ Mixx.

2659
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:15,960
Come on baby, yeah.

2660
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:16,960
Here you go.

2661
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:17,960
That game was awesome.

2662
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:22,680
If you want to give us a call and talk about how you can't wait for Imagine Baby's the

2663
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:29,840
party game, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, I just like

2664
02:17:29,840 --> 02:17:37,000
the reaffirmation we got from our chat room with Josie16 saying, they sure can poop, as

2665
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
if we didn't know.

2666
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:41,240
Thanks for the clarification, appreciate that.

2667
02:17:41,240 --> 02:17:46,400
AnimeSatsuma in chat says, I can't wait for the breastfeeding minigame.

2668
02:17:46,400 --> 02:17:47,400
Me neither.

2669
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:51,360
Anyhow, we've got a caller on Skype, hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2670
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:54,120
Hi, this is Gia68.

2671
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:56,120
Hi Gia68, how are you?

2672
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:57,120
Alright.

2673
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:02,120
Hey, you got to go to California Extreme and you met Jamie live and in person, right?

2674
02:18:02,120 --> 02:18:03,120
Yep.

2675
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:07,080
Now, I've asked you this because I've always wondered this myself, what's Jamie like in

2676
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:10,880
real life off the air?

2677
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:16,080
Last time, I kind of didn't recognize her at first, because last time I saw her was

2678
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:20,520
at Fanta Mae and she had, I think, magenta-ish hair, I don't remember.

2679
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:30,200
Yeah, my hair was black in front and red in back, but this time my hair was all black.

2680
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:38,640
Also Jamie, when you're speaking in person, you sound a little younger than you do right

2681
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:39,640
now on the air.

2682
02:18:39,640 --> 02:18:40,640
Okay.

2683
02:18:40,640 --> 02:18:41,640
Okay.

2684
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:42,640
I think the radio makes our voices base-ier.

2685
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,640
Yeah.

2686
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:44,640
It just, yeah.

2687
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:47,640
Well, didn't Travis say I used to sound like a hyperactive 13-year-old?

2688
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:50,200
Yes, but then you went through puberty.

2689
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:51,200
That was many years ago.

2690
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,200
You just dab-robbed with a face.

2691
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:55,200
Microphones.

2692
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,920
Alright, look, in all seriousness, how was, how was California Extreme?

2693
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:02,000
It was pretty cool.

2694
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:06,800
Alright then, what games did you enjoy playing, like, were there some classic games you'd

2695
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:11,720
not really paid respect to before that caught your eyes?

2696
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:16,560
Let's see, there were a bunch of, most of the games I played were games that I already

2697
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:23,960
played or, and I was familiar with, or I hadn't played in a while, like, the old Star Wars

2698
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:29,520
arcade game or Tron, at least the games I hadn't really played before, like, Tailgunner

2699
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:31,520
and Looping.

2700
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:35,480
Dude, they had the old Star Wars game there.

2701
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:36,480
That game was awesome.

2702
02:19:36,480 --> 02:19:39,680
I got it for sale on top of it, the sit-down cabinet.

2703
02:19:39,680 --> 02:19:41,760
They had like three of those machines there.

2704
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,720
I could fit a Star Wars cabinet in here, how much they want for it?

2705
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:46,720
I want to say, what, was it 500?

2706
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:48,480
Wow, was it in decent shape?

2707
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:50,800
Fairly, I didn't play it, I played Cinestar though.

2708
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:54,840
Oh my god, I want to sit down Cinestar.

2709
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:58,240
Dude, I want an arcade machine in my garage, wouldn't that be awesome?

2710
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:59,240
Rob!

2711
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:00,240
What?

2712
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:01,240
Build a maim.

2713
02:20:01,240 --> 02:20:03,480
But I want like a, I want a real one.

2714
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:04,720
It's real!

2715
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:05,720
You can touch it!

2716
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:06,720
Alright, alright.

2717
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:07,720
We'll see, we'll see.

2718
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:09,520
If you set it on fire, it'll burn.

2719
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:10,520
We'll see.

2720
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:12,840
I don't think my roommate would like that idea very much.

2721
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,160
I know my wife didn't.

2722
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:18,640
Yeah, except I'm not married to the roommate, it's more of a business arrangement, it's

2723
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,640
a little different.

2724
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:20,640
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

2725
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:23,200
I like to think of my marriage that way too.

2726
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:25,800
Originally, that's all marriage was, was a business agreement.

2727
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:29,160
Look, GS68, is there anything, we're getting on tangents, is there anything else you want

2728
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,160
to add about your wonderful weekend?

2729
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:38,960
Um, yeah, I, mostly I was playing The Grid, which is like this third-person shooter.

2730
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,200
I know The Grid, The Grid is awesome!

2731
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:47,640
Yeah, and Rush 2049, which was that racing game of horror that before Wonka and Maxie.

2732
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:50,360
Did they ever bring The Grid out on home consoles?

2733
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:52,240
I think it's on regular Playstation, isn't it?

2734
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:53,400
No, I don't think it is.

2735
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,400
Wow, that's kind of weird.

2736
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:56,400
Interesting.

2737
02:20:56,400 --> 02:21:00,440
Alright, well, GS68, any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we take another call?

2738
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:04,240
Nintendo did not address resource space at E3.

2739
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:05,880
Epic fucking fail.

2740
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:06,880
Agreed.

2741
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:09,440
I'm very disappointed they didn't address it.

2742
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:14,840
I hold out hope that maybe since folks at Nintendo feel that this is not where they're

2743
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:19,400
going to be addressing the hardcore gamers anymore, my hopes are at PAX, our questions

2744
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:23,120
will be answered because I can't think of what other show is for the hardcore gamers

2745
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:25,400
except maybe Tokyo Game Show.

2746
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:28,520
Thank you for stealing my words, Tokyo Game Show would be the other one.

2747
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:32,320
Yeah, they don't display at Tokyo Game Show though, normally Nintendo's not there.

2748
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:33,320
Yeah, but they do something concurrent.

2749
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:34,520
They do their Nintendo World crap.

2750
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:36,640
Yeah, they do that thing concurrently.

2751
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:40,120
It's pretty much the same thing.

2752
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:44,760
On all our endgame fads, I haven't my sake estimated since I'm not removing it until

2753
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:48,880
Nintendo addresses resource space.

2754
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:50,600
I think it's very unfortunate they didn't.

2755
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:57,040
I mean, that little speaker system is kind of whatever, just roll out a freaking patch

2756
02:21:57,040 --> 02:21:58,920
that supports the SD cards.

2757
02:21:58,920 --> 02:22:01,360
Do it overnight while we're sleeping, you know?

2758
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:02,360
Just do it.

2759
02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:03,360
Yeah, whatever happens.

2760
02:22:03,360 --> 02:22:09,640
I mean, PS2 did it, the original Xbox did it, why can't a console that's one generation

2761
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:10,640
ahead?

2762
02:22:10,640 --> 02:22:13,520
Oh, but it's the new generation, not the next generation.

2763
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:17,400
But you have to understand, they announced stuff that's been out on other systems forever

2764
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:20,680
and act like it's the new, newest thing ever.

2765
02:22:20,680 --> 02:22:25,920
Like, oh my god, it's voice chat over the internet, and woo, this has never been done

2766
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:27,240
a billion times before.

2767
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:28,840
Oh, but wait, it's different.

2768
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:33,240
It's a community voice chat because it's a giant, you know, microphone thing instead

2769
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:38,640
of headsets because we couldn't figure out how to do headsets, so we made a big USB microphone,

2770
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:39,640
surprise.

2771
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:44,640
You know, I wish I could use my own USB microphone on that because, to be honest, I don't know.

2772
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:47,960
I don't want to have to, I don't want to buy anything.

2773
02:22:47,960 --> 02:22:51,040
Alright, just to see, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.

2774
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:52,320
Have a good one, buddy.

2775
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:53,320
See ya.

2776
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:56,560
This is Golden7GameOLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2777
02:22:56,560 --> 02:22:59,240
If you want to give us a call, we are standing by.

2778
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:00,240
Operators are standing by.

2779
02:23:00,240 --> 02:23:05,100
I don't think we're going to do too many calls tonight because thanks to all of our frickin'

2780
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:09,200
network issues we've been having, among other things, it's kind of put us a little behind

2781
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:12,600
on time, so I think we're going to get out of here a decent hour tonight, so we'll see

2782
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,600
what happens.

2783
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:14,600
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

2784
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:15,600
Who's this?

2785
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:16,600
Hi, this is Gold Banjo.

2786
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:19,920
Hey, Gold Banjo, what's on your mind, buddy?

2787
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:23,960
I'm really pissed that they didn't have the F-Zero Wii and Star Fox Wii.

2788
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:24,960
Amen to F-Zero.

2789
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:26,760
Yeah, Star Fox Wii I'm okay with.

2790
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:31,120
Star Fox seems to be the game that comes out really late in the, uh, because I just remember

2791
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:34,920
that Star Fox GameCube thing, that adventures or whatever the hell that thing was, that

2792
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:35,920
didn't come out until-

2793
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:36,920
I never got around to that.

2794
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:37,920
That, well, you didn't miss much.

2795
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:40,440
It didn't come out until really late in the GameCube cycle.

2796
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:45,240
Star Fox will be the thing that we get a couple years down the road, but F-Zero, man, maybe

2797
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:49,880
it's just because Mario Kart is still out there, so they want Mario Kart to be the racing

2798
02:23:49,880 --> 02:23:53,600
thing for a little while, but I really hope that next year's E3 we get something about

2799
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,600
F-Zero.

2800
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:56,600
Yeah, me too.

2801
02:23:56,600 --> 02:24:00,880
We'll see, but I'm just, you know, I'm a big F-Zero fan, you know, what can I say?

2802
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:04,440
I wouldn't mind watching somebody else kind of pick that up, you know, Wipeout's kind

2803
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:05,440
of cool.

2804
02:24:05,440 --> 02:24:07,560
I guess Wipeout's the closest thing I can think of on another system that's kind of

2805
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:11,820
like F-Zero, but it's not the same, but I love that futuristic fast racing.

2806
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:14,160
That's my favorite, is the future fast.

2807
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:15,160
Speed Racer.

2808
02:24:15,160 --> 02:24:16,160
Really?

2809
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:17,160
I'm gonna have to check that out.

2810
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:18,240
You should check it out.

2811
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,240
It's actually pretty cool.

2812
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:20,240
Do you own it?

2813
02:24:20,240 --> 02:24:21,240
Uh, yes.

2814
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:22,640
I'm gonna borrow it.

2815
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:23,640
You can't borrow it.

2816
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:24,640
Oh, okay, I get it.

2817
02:24:24,640 --> 02:24:25,640
I get it.

2818
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:26,640
Funny.

2819
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:28,640
All right, what else is on your mind, GoldBander?

2820
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,640
What else, what do you think of the other stuff?

2821
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:39,320
Well, this week I finally, I'm actually starting to get into some PC gaming, I was playing

2822
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:45,360
a bunch of the Source Engine games from Steam and stuff, Valve, like Half-Life, Portal,

2823
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:51,600
and I was having some fun with that, I guess, so that was a blast.

2824
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:55,600
There's some fun stuff on Steam, if you haven't seen it yet, check out Audiosurf, I like that

2825
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:56,600
one on Steam.

2826
02:24:56,600 --> 02:25:01,360
I played the demo and I really liked it, I'm thinking about it.

2827
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:04,640
I wish there was some more multiplayer type stuff you could do in there, but it's still

2828
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:05,640
fun.

2829
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:11,320
It reminds me of Klax on speed, that's what I love, I used to love Klax back in the day.

2830
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:18,520
I got my butt with the first online journey onto the online thing, there's always going

2831
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:26,960
to be that, the little kid that likes to swear and be rude, and the kid's like speaking some

2832
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:34,000
other language and stuff, and then once we start to try and vote ban him, then he apologizes

2833
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:40,560
and speaks English, so I'm like, now you can speak English, and it just got me so mad and

2834
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:46,000
stuff, and then he's like swearing not to ban him, we just ban him, no questions, no

2835
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:47,000
further things.

2836
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Good for you.

2837
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:53,080
I have a zero tolerance policy for idiots on those things, and on Xbox Live I warn them

2838
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:56,920
every time, I do the little feedback thing every time.

2839
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:01,320
I'm a little jerk on Xbox Live, I'm a tattletale, but you know what?

2840
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:03,040
Somebody's got to do it.

2841
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:05,120
Exactly.

2842
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,120
It's just annoying.

2843
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:09,600
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Go Banjo?

2844
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:17,680
Let me think, I don't know, you three could have been better, but I am excited for Banjo

2845
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:23,720
Kazooie 3, I don't care what anybody else says, I'm a hardcore Banjo Kazooie fan.

2846
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:26,880
We haven't had a lot of Banjo Kazooie love on the show tonight, so there you have it.

2847
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:30,960
Go Banjo, adding a little bit of Banjo Kazooie love, so it's not just a clever name, Banjo

2848
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:31,960
Kazooie.

2849
02:26:31,960 --> 02:26:34,080
Alright, have a good night, my friend, take care.

2850
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:35,080
Okay, later.

2851
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:40,240
I was going to say too, real quick, if you are interested in a game that's sort of like

2852
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:44,280
F-Zero, try the Speed Racer Wii game.

2853
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:47,640
It just dropped in price, it's only $29.99 now, and you probably can get it used for

2854
02:26:47,640 --> 02:26:48,640
even cheaper.

2855
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:50,720
I still need to play the pinball game I got on Wii.

2856
02:26:50,720 --> 02:26:53,520
I've played a little bit of it, and it's fun, I need to play more of it, because pinball

2857
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:55,720
is awesome, right, Jamie?

2858
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:57,160
Yes, it is.

2859
02:26:57,160 --> 02:27:01,320
Or if you don't own a Wii, you can get it on the PS2 coming in September.

2860
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:04,760
Aw, Shaoran in chat called me a fucking narc.

2861
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:06,880
The narc was an awesome game, so shut up.

2862
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:12,120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2863
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:13,400
Bow down to Pyramid Head.

2864
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:14,720
No, this is Osprey.

2865
02:27:14,720 --> 02:27:16,720
Hey, what's up, Osprey?

2866
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:19,000
That'd be cool if Pyramid Head did call us.

2867
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,640
I feel like I'm the only one that was kind of excited for a new Zelda game to be announced,

2868
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:26,920
and it was never announced, so I'm sad.

2869
02:27:26,920 --> 02:27:31,320
I didn't have my hopes up for it, it did seem a little bit soon in the Zelda cycle.

2870
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:33,000
Next year, definitely.

2871
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,400
Next year, definitely, definitely.

2872
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:36,000
This year, not so much.

2873
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:39,280
Didn't we just get a DS game not that long ago?

2874
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:41,720
The whole little Wind Waker looking thing?

2875
02:27:41,720 --> 02:27:42,720
That was just last year, right?

2876
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:43,720
Yeah.

2877
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:44,720
It was a fan of my hourglass.

2878
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:47,720
It was, I don't know, it was okay.

2879
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:51,520
You have to remember, Nintendo's developing for two major platforms now, it's not just

2880
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:56,480
about the Wii, it's about the DS as well, so you know, they're a little split there,

2881
02:27:56,480 --> 02:28:03,240
but I think you'll see a new Zelda, you know, Uber-type looking game next year, probably.

2882
02:28:03,240 --> 02:28:08,440
I was more surprised, that Kid Icarus thing, with all the evidence that supported its existence,

2883
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:10,720
I'm very surprised that it didn't show up.

2884
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:11,720
Very surprised.

2885
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:16,800
Well, you know that they're just trying to appeal to the casual gamer now, so I guess

2886
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:20,280
we're not even going to hear about that at E3 anymore.

2887
02:28:20,280 --> 02:28:21,280
Maybe E for All?

2888
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,080
I don't know, isn't E for All supposed to have the big three this year?

2889
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:27,240
E for All usually has them all, but they don't make any announcements there.

2890
02:28:27,240 --> 02:28:31,960
If anything, it's going to be around Tokyo Game Show, or whatever their game world thing

2891
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:32,960
is.

2892
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:36,320
I think they still have time to announce some more titles for, because really they only

2893
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:43,440
have Animal Crossing, which I think, I thought that was November 7th-ish, it might actually

2894
02:28:43,440 --> 02:28:48,400
be in October, it's around October, November, and then that's pretty much it for the holiday.

2895
02:28:48,400 --> 02:28:52,840
I mean, that's all they've announced so far for Wii, so that's their one title.

2896
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:55,860
They have room for some more titles to get slipped in there, because usually they have

2897
02:28:55,860 --> 02:28:57,760
a title coming out each month.

2898
02:28:57,760 --> 02:29:02,800
Last year was Donkey Kong Barrel Blast for September.

2899
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:06,640
There was Battalion Wars 2 for October.

2900
02:29:06,640 --> 02:29:13,800
And then for November was, of course, the Wii Zapper and Super Mario Galaxy.

2901
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:19,180
I don't think there was anything for December, January was something.

2902
02:29:19,180 --> 02:29:22,400
But they have room to announce some more games in there, and I don't think they're going

2903
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:27,680
to have one game for the holiday, unless they manage to get the Wii Sports Resort thing

2904
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:28,680
out.

2905
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:32,280
So, I expect some more announcements.

2906
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:37,160
So some hopefulness from Loki that makes sense, makes sense to me, he's right, there's got

2907
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:39,640
to be more than one game coming out this Christmas.

2908
02:29:39,640 --> 02:29:45,400
Alright, any other thoughts, Osfer?

2909
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:49,920
I'm kind of concerned about the future for DDR, seeing as that they want to add mines

2910
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:53,960
or shock arrows, as they call it, into it.

2911
02:29:53,960 --> 02:29:58,400
At least they're trying something new for them, but you're right, I don't think it's

2912
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:02,840
going to give the game the swift kick in the pants it needs, but it's something I guess

2913
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:04,280
to hold people over.

2914
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:09,240
Well, I don't want DDR to turn into ITG, because that's like one of the main reasons I hate

2915
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:10,240
in the group.

2916
02:30:10,240 --> 02:30:13,960
It's because I hate mines, like, you play the game to step on the arrows, not to freaking

2917
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:14,960
dodge them.

2918
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:15,960
It's just irritating.

2919
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:19,320
If, hey, as long as they have maybe, you know, you can turn freeze arrows off, so I'm sure

2920
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:23,660
you can turn those things off too, but I get what you mean, you kind of hope that they

2921
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:26,320
don't whore it out, you know what I mean?

2922
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:31,480
Yeah, and also, even if you can turn it off, like in the group, it kicks you from being

2923
02:30:31,480 --> 02:30:36,200
able to rank in any of the songs, so, I don't know.

2924
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:37,200
Interesting.

2925
02:30:37,200 --> 02:30:38,200
Well, we'll see.

2926
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:41,800
I am curious about that new machine, though, when everyone comes to our neighborhood.

2927
02:30:41,800 --> 02:30:44,040
Hopefully it doesn't get broken by little kids first, we'll see.

2928
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:49,200
I forgot to mention, I played Guitar Freaks V4 this week.

2929
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:52,160
I have to say I'm very unimpressed by it.

2930
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:56,800
It's just, I don't know, the whole interface and everything looks like a really shoddy

2931
02:30:56,800 --> 02:31:03,600
PlayStation 2 game, which, actually, I think the releases of Guitar Freaks are on PlayStation

2932
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:07,120
2, so I guess that makes sense, but no innovation whatsoever.

2933
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:11,920
Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, we're gonna wrap up the show, but have a good

2934
02:31:11,920 --> 02:31:12,920
one, okay?

2935
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:17,120
Alright, see ya, I'm calling for the night.

2936
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,120
Later.

2937
02:31:18,120 --> 02:31:20,800
Alright, we're gonna close the Skyplane for now.

2938
02:31:20,800 --> 02:31:24,880
If you didn't get through, I'm so sorry, but you can always leave us a voicemail, or, and

2939
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:27,700
I gotta catch up on voicemails, probably next week we'll do that, or you can always send

2940
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:30,840
us an email, mailbagorangeonstrader.com, let's do some last-minute stories.

2941
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,240
Jamie, you said you had a couple.

2942
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:36,240
Uh, actually, I do, and one of them, because I couldn't get the email pulled back up, I

2943
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:41,720
found it from another site, but this one was given to me by Rob2Bees.

2944
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:49,640
Time Hollow, which is a Konami game for the DS, is to be localized and released in August.

2945
02:31:49,640 --> 02:31:53,880
It's actually, the neat thing about the game is that you get this thing called a time pen,

2946
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:58,440
which is your stylus, that you use to manipulate time to solve puzzles within the game.

2947
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:05,080
It's very, uh, almost sort of, uh, Phoenix Wright-ish, in terms of how, uh, how it feels

2948
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:10,040
or how it plays, but you can check, uh, either the, um, the Japanese website for it, which

2949
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:16,960
is, uh, konami.jp slash time underscore hollow, or, um, I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube.

2950
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:21,600
And the other thing that's, um, I know a few other, uh, anime fans would be excited about

2951
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:27,600
this is that Sega grabbed the license for, um, the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, um,

2952
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:34,160
for Nintendo DS, um, actually several of the, the DS games, um, from, uh, Namco Bandai and

2953
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:40,440
Sega's like, um, okay, we want, so, um, you might see those eventually, and you can also

2954
02:32:40,440 --> 02:32:42,720
get the, the little happy dance that she does.

2955
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:48,640
I want the PlayStation 2 one, because in the PlayStation 2 one, she apparently makes her

2956
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:51,200
own RPG, and then you get to play it.

2957
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,200
Cool.

2958
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:53,200
So.

2959
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:54,200
Very cool.

2960
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:55,200
Okay.

2961
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,200
Loki, anything?

2962
02:32:56,200 --> 02:33:01,320
Of course I have stuff, I have a long laundry list of stuff.

2963
02:33:01,320 --> 02:33:03,320
Make it quick, we want to go home.

2964
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:08,420
Um, anyways, Ubisoft announced a game called I Am Alive, it's like a survival game, looks

2965
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:15,040
pretty cool, coming out Spring 2009, and, uh, yeah, I have an awesome trailer for that.

2966
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:19,400
Rock Band 2, they announced the full track list for the game, which is pretty awesome,

2967
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:25,960
including, uh, there's ACDC, AFI, Las Morcet, um, Alice in Chains, Bad Company, Beastie

2968
02:33:25,960 --> 02:33:31,240
Boys, Billy Idol, um, there is Journey, uh, any way you want it.

2969
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:33,720
Pretty much one of those rumored lists came true, it seems like.

2970
02:33:33,720 --> 02:33:35,840
Yes, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, et cetera, et cetera.

2971
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:36,840
Fleetwood Mac, awesome.

2972
02:33:36,840 --> 02:33:42,640
Um, but there is 84 songs that they detailed, and I hear there's going to be 20 more tracks

2973
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:46,720
as well, but they're going to be free downloads, so, that's kind of cool.

2974
02:33:46,720 --> 02:33:47,720
That's cool.

2975
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:54,880
Um, also, um, there's some stuff, there is a no fail option as well for Rock Band 2,

2976
02:33:54,880 --> 02:34:00,480
or what I like to call it, Drunk Party Option, so that's pretty cool.

2977
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:08,860
And um, some, um, kind of a change of pace here, but apparently, the, um, Rock Band instruments

2978
02:34:08,860 --> 02:34:13,120
will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour.

2979
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:17,200
So you'll actually be able to use them, uh, what they're going to do, since Guitar Hero

2980
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:22,920
World Tour has, you know, five things you can hit instead of, um, you know, the four,

2981
02:34:22,920 --> 02:34:27,320
they're going to actually, um, automatically disable one of those when you play that, um,

2982
02:34:27,320 --> 02:34:28,440
so that's kind of cool.

2983
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:35,760
Also, the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, um, is being patched to utilize

2984
02:34:35,760 --> 02:34:40,960
the Rock Band, um, guitars on the 360, so that's kind of cool as well.

2985
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:43,400
Good, good move, thank you.

2986
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:49,520
Um, apparently NCAA Football 09 is really broken, uh, there you have a laundry list

2987
02:34:49,520 --> 02:34:54,640
of stuff that's just not working, including some sliders, like the CPU sliders, and don't

2988
02:34:54,640 --> 02:35:01,400
do anything, uh, the online dynasty mode's broken, the super sim mode is broken, and

2989
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:06,360
the kick returns are also broken, and some other crap, so, way to go EA Sports also,

2990
02:35:06,360 --> 02:35:08,800
um, I want to say NASCAR 09.

2991
02:35:08,800 --> 02:35:11,400
The game saves are broken, sweet.

2992
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:19,080
Um, one thing that's kind of interesting is, um, apparently Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had, uh,

2993
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:25,800
been patched, there was a, um, disk check thing being added into the game, um, but it

2994
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:31,760
was a problem for people that got the game via digital download, and so the fix for it,

2995
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:38,400
well, apparently Ubisoft used a pirate hack that someone had made to bypass the disk check

2996
02:35:38,400 --> 02:35:39,400
thing.

2997
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:40,400
What?

2998
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:41,400
Nice.

2999
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:42,400
So they, um, used that to fix it.

3000
02:35:42,400 --> 02:35:43,400
Huh.

3001
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,400
Interesting.

3002
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:52,520
Um, also, the NPD results for, um, June have come out, and the Wii is now the number one

3003
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:59,360
selling system in the US, as well as the world now, so, 10.9 million units with the, um,

3004
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:06,160
Xbox 360 trailing behind by just a little bit, so, very interesting.

3005
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:12,240
Um, Nintendo Power has announced a, um, new game via their cover here, uh, what we thought

3006
02:36:12,240 --> 02:36:18,400
may have been Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually Sonic and the Black Knight, um, which is,

3007
02:36:18,400 --> 02:36:24,920
looks like a role-playing game, maybe a little bit Kingdom Hearts-esque, I don't know, um,

3008
02:36:24,920 --> 02:36:28,400
there's also rumors that Nintendo might actually be publishing that title, so that's-

3009
02:36:28,400 --> 02:36:30,200
Sonic and Mario World, that would be awesome.

3010
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,240
So that'd be kind of interesting there.

3011
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:39,920
Um, Miyamoto, um, announced that they're making a Pikmin game, so, that's kind of cool, um,

3012
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:45,240
and one other Nintendo game that kind of went under the radar here, Rhythm Heaven is, has

3013
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:51,000
been announced for the US, it's actually, um, Rhythm Tengoku Gold is being localized

3014
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:57,000
for North America and, of course, is a rhythm music game, uh, Samba de Amigo, uh, Sega has

3015
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:03,160
confirmed that it will be getting downloaded, and, um, it's actually going to debut some

3016
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:10,680
launch content, um, starting on September, uh, 23rd when the game is launched, and, uh,

3017
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:15,200
the first set of downloads will include the 80s, um, radio song, I guess, I Want Candy

3018
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:23,160
from, uh, Bow Wow Wow, or Bow Wow Wow Wow, yeah, we get it, too many, uh, Jets, um, Are

3019
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:30,440
You Going to Be My Girl, and Lou Bega's Mambo Mambo, and no word if those are paid to unlock,

3020
02:37:30,440 --> 02:37:36,400
um, content, or if it's actually download content, but interesting, nonetheless, and,

3021
02:37:36,400 --> 02:37:44,760
um, let's see here, there was a new unlock code for Supernova 2 cabinets that, uh, revealed

3022
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:52,200
three more songs, uh, Terra Stars, and, um, let's see, Jet Girl Spins, uh, Mars Wars 3,

3023
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:59,600
and Revenge G Alternative with, uh, Reba, Reba Bata, or however you pronounce that,

3024
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:06,960
and then, of course, uh, Paranoid Hades, so that's kind of cool, and let's see here, real

3025
02:38:06,960 --> 02:38:15,680
quick, that's a lot of last minute stories, sorry, sorry, I'm quickly, I'm trying to be

3026
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:21,560
quick, um, GPS coming to the PSP within nine months, uh, there are details releasing some

3027
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:28,280
Famicom inspired classic controllers, so you can import those if you want them, um, let's

3028
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:33,720
see here, well, it was E3 week, so it was a little busy this week, fun little bit of

3029
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:39,920
trivia, Animal Crossing, which was being shown off at E3, actually had, of course, none other

3030
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:46,000
than Charles Martinet playing the game as well from an undisclosed location with a Mario

3031
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:51,200
style avatar, and, uh, he was riffing people in the Mario voice, and was also hitting people

3032
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:55,200
with axes and complaining about people that ran over his flowers, I'm thinking undisclosed

3033
02:38:55,200 --> 02:38:59,400
location means backstage, because, yeah, I don't know if you remember when they showed

3034
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:04,360
off the whole, uh, voice chat, or the DS, uh, internet thing, but they had, uh, Charles

3035
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:09,000
Martinet in Seattle, right, remember that, uh, and then you would see him, like, an hour

3036
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:14,320
later walking around the show floor, yeah, cause he could teleport, um, there is a rumor

3037
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:19,000
that someone is working on a PSP emulator for the Wii, and they have screenshots, unfortunately

3038
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:22,520
right now it's only running at about seven frames per second, but that's still disturbing

3039
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:26,640
nonetheless, Animal Crossing will support USB keyboards, so you can actually type your

3040
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:31,120
messages to people without having to use the Wii remote, because that sucked, uh, Gears

3041
02:39:31,120 --> 02:39:35,520
of War 2 is coming out November 7th this year, so people are probably excited about that,

3042
02:39:35,520 --> 02:39:40,480
uh, LittleBigPlanet is going to allow you to charge users for your content that you

3043
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:46,920
created, oh god, so you can make money off that shit, um, there's apparently some shocking

3044
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:56,280
announcement coming to, um, the DKS3713, um, event put out by Square Enix, something related

3045
02:39:56,280 --> 02:40:04,160
to Final Fantasy VII, uh oh, uh, Rock Band 2 is going to be, the release of this is really

3046
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:10,480
strange, um, the game only version for the Xbox 360 is coming out in September, the bundle,

3047
02:40:10,480 --> 02:40:15,720
as long as, with the PS3 bundle, the PS3 standalone version is coming out in October, and then

3048
02:40:15,720 --> 02:40:22,240
the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions I think are coming out in November, is that confusing

3049
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:29,440
enough, um, and then let's see here, and then my favorite thing, which I'm going to end

3050
02:40:29,440 --> 02:40:37,000
on here real quick, is that, um, there's a quote taken from, uh, G4, apparently is an

3051
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:42,280
interview with Reggie Fils-Aime, who says, how could you feel left out? The Animal Crossing

3052
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:48,080
that we've been hearing about that people wanted, uh, fully connected to the internet,

3053
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:52,460
go to other people's towns, plus I said Grand Theft Auto on the DS, how do you feel left

3054
02:40:52,460 --> 02:41:01,700
out with those types of announcements? Well, it's quite easy. There's about 500 other things

3055
02:41:01,700 --> 02:41:07,280
you didn't address, but maybe it's just me. I'm not a casual gamer, what do I know? Alright,

3056
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:11,280
thank you for the, uh, follow-up updates, although quite lengthy, it was E3 week, there's

3057
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:15,520
a lot of shit going on, next week I'm sure we'll have a lot of stuff too, as the fallout

3058
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:20,720
begins from E3 and we start ramping up towards Christmas, as was said earlier, but for now,

3059
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:25,240
we go around and we get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight?

3060
02:41:25,240 --> 02:41:30,000
My final thought is, this is actually kind of funny, there's, um, apparently Dead Rising,

3061
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:34,640
the Wii version is being called Dead Rising Zombie Sacrifice in Japan, and I don't know

3062
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:38,760
if this is true, but for the US version, I heard that they're calling it Dead Rising

3063
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:47,640
Chop Until You Drop. Cheesy. I like that. My final thought is, I kind of want a burrito.

3064
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:55,080
Dark Soccer, your final thought? Uh oh, we might have to chop till we drop Dark Soccer,

3065
02:41:55,080 --> 02:42:00,960
she sounds like she's turning into a zombie. That is a distinct possibility. Alright, um,

3066
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:07,240
until then, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and

3067
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:11,120
supporting Orange Launcher. Remember, if you like what you hear, oh, sorry. God damn it.

3068
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:15,680
Sorry. Sorry. I am ending this damn show. This is important. No, we want to do the cage

3069
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:21,040
match. This is important, real quick. DDRX, they're reviving some of their old, um, licensed

3070
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:24,760
songs, including Dubby Dub and Butterfly, and they may have mentioned that last week,

3071
02:42:24,760 --> 02:42:30,300
but I don't remember. Either way. Dubby Dub's coming back. Do not want. That might make

3072
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:35,280
a headache worse, won't it? I've got a very bad headache right now. I'm sorry. Alright,

3073
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:39,560
well remember, if you like what you hear, we persevere through the headaches and through

3074
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:43,480
the fire and the flames to bring you this program each and every week. Please tell two

3075
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:47,560
friends you know about the program. That's how we spread around the world slowly. Hey,

3076
02:42:47,560 --> 02:42:50,960
we'll see you at PAX in a few weeks. Those of you that are going, all three of us are

3077
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:54,240
going to be there, and I can't wait to meet you guys. I don't know if there will be an

3078
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:57,840
OLR meetup one night, but I imagine we'll do something. It's going to be a party. It's

3079
02:42:57,840 --> 02:43:04,080
going to be so much fun. Right, Loki? It's so much fun? I don't know. I've never been

3080
02:43:04,080 --> 02:43:09,280
to PAX. Alright. Until then, we'll see you guys next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3081
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:14,920
