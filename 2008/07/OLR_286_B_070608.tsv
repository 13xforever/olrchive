0	6000	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
6000	15000	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15000	19000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19000	22000	And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
22000	28000	We are live on this 4th of July weekend, except it's actually the 6th of July now in 2008.
28000	31000	Did everybody have a good 4th of July weekend? We have a lot of people in studio tonight.
31000	34000	If you haven't listened to part 8 yet, we have tons of guests. Did you guys all have a good 4th of July?
34000	36000	Oh, we had a couple encounters, but yeah.
36000	37000	A couple encounters? What's that mean?
37000	38000	Random encounters.
38000	41000	Random encounters? It's like you are suddenly attacked by a grey slime?
41000	46000	Yeah, and just substitute unexpected fireworks.
46000	49000	Oh yes. Good times. Good times.
49000	52000	Now 4th of July, you're from New York City, Rama.
52000	57000	So the 4th of July in a cow town like this one is a little different from what you're used to in Brooklyn, right?
57000	59000	Not necessarily.
59000	60000	Really?
60000	65000	Even out in Brooklyn, it's very suburbanite. Out in New York City, we look forward to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.
65000	67000	That's the big thing.
67000	70000	Do people go shoot their guns off in the middle of the street for 4th of July?
70000	74000	Actually, that's more up in the South Bronx where I used to live.
74000	76000	You're confusing that with Texas.
76000	78000	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
78000	84000	Alright, well, we hope everybody had a safe 4th of July. Unless you're not an American citizen, then I hope you had a good Friday.
84000	90000	I would like to say in a very cryptic fashion that thank God the end of my headache is over.
90000	94000	I can continue on with the work that I have been working on for a few weeks now.
94000	97000	If I'm not mistaken, Loki will be unveiling something big on next week's show.
97000	98000	Hopefully.
98000	100000	Cross your fingers, cross your toes.
100000	106000	The funny thing about the 4th of July that really quickly, because I went to the extravaganza at Dark Sakura's house that she had,
106000	111000	stupid me thought, I want to bring something, I want to contribute to Dark Sakura's thing this year.
111000	114000	I don't want to be a leecher. So I brought fireworks.
114000	117000	I went out and bought like $40 worth of fireworks and brought it to the party.
117000	118000	I was like, okay, cool.
118000	123000	And only to be upstaged by all the more awesome illegal fireworks that were present.
123000	128000	Yeah, our neighbor put in money for the legal stuff.
128000	131000	So we never even set my group off.
131000	132000	I think we opened yours.
132000	134000	No, I don't think we opened it. I brought it back.
134000	135000	Oh, you did? Oh.
135000	141000	So I'm saving it for a rainy day, like Christmas. We'll set up Christmas fireworks or Halloween fireworks.
141000	143000	And we'll open presents next 4th of July.
143000	144000	Exactly.
144000	147000	Quick poll in chat room while we do the next story.
147000	150000	When should I light off the spare fireworks that I have?
150000	152000	$40 worth of safe and lame fireworks.
152000	154000	When should I light them off?
154000	155000	For the fuck show?
155000	157000	Who knows? In the garage.
157000	158000	That wouldn't be...
158000	159000	Do it now.
159000	160000	Do it now.
160000	163000	Our void says now. I don't think that's going to happen, sir.
163000	166000	Alright. It's the 6th of July party. Yay.
166000	169000	Alright, let's get back to some gaming news. Loki, kick it off.
169000	172000	Yes, no fireworks right now.
172000	180000	But we talked a little bit earlier. Actually, Rob did during his release dates for Japan that Persona 4 was going to be coming out soon.
180000	184000	Well, guess what? Persona 4 is also making its way to North America as well.
184000	187000	Just not until December 9th.
187000	190000	And that should be pretty awesome.
190000	194000	And it was teased on, I think, a new trailer for Persona 4.
194000	199000	So, December 9th is when you can get your Persona 4 on.
202000	209000	Oh, and it says also that each game will be bundled with the soundtrack CD as well with select music from the game.
210000	213000	And there are many RPG fans going, squee!
213000	215000	Does it come with a free spirit gun?
215000	220000	I think it's cool, though, that they're still cranking them out for the PlayStation 2.
220000	222000	Quality games for the PlayStation 2. It's not just a budget system.
222000	223000	Yeah.
223000	224000	It's still got good stuff.
224000	233000	Well, it's cheaper to develop for, and if they want to jump to the PS3, they'll still sell probably what they would sell on the PS3 with the PS2.
233000	237000	Alright. Lots of comments from chat about when to light off the fireworks.
237000	239000	Too many people are saying, do it now.
239000	242000	And that's not going to happen with a gas heater in here, okay?
242000	246000	That's a bad idea. That's the kind of stuff that you see on America's scariest home videos.
247000	255000	Let's see. When you know who gets disbarred, says Amaze Satsuma, for the fuck show.
255000	262000	Oh, AJ Mix says at the beginning of the fuck show, and GS68 calls them fuck works. Nice.
262000	263000	I do like that idea.
263000	266000	You can't do it for the fuck show because then you know when the fuck show was.
266000	268000	Exactly. Exactly.
268000	269000	That would ruin it.
269000	275000	Alright. So we're not doing them now, sorry to say. We're not stupid, and we're not going to end up on headlines.
275000	279000	Anyhow, we were talking about PlayStation 2 games, now PlayStation 2 games are still coming out.
279000	289000	Get this, Sony is actually going to be coming out with an even slimmer and cooler looking, in their words, suave, version of the PlayStation 2.
289000	293000	Here's the interesting thing. It's going to be coming out in India first, and then Europe.
293000	297000	It's going to be coming out on October 28th in India. There you have it.
297000	298000	You know what that means.
298000	299000	What?
299000	303000	Ben Heck will be able to make an even cooler PS2 portable system.
303000	310000	The Economic Times, who reported this initially, also says there will be no more external AC adapter.
310000	315000	The price will still be the same, about $162 American because this is in other countries.
315000	319000	What do you mean no more AC adapter that's external?
319000	323000	I'm assuming that means the plug is built right into it, so you don't have to plug in an external adapter now.
323000	325000	It's built right into the system, I would imagine.
325000	332000	Well, I guess. Those power supplies are pretty small nowadays, especially with the micro-ITX stuff.
332000	335000	There you have it. That's going to be pretty cool.
335000	341000	I wonder if that will come out here most likely. Especially if there's still quality games like Persona 4 coming out, why not?
341000	345000	There's still a demand for it, and hey, they're a cheap DVD player on top of all that other stuff.
345000	348000	At least that's what the rest of America thinks.
348000	351000	So, there you have it. Moving on.
351000	363000	Well, in other news, there is a list that was released by Hideo Kojima, who said what his top five favorite games are.
363000	371000	He was actually speaking to a newspaper, Yomiuri Shinbun, and he listed Super Mario Bros. series,
371000	376000	Outerworld, and Xevious as being some of the most memorable and influential games.
376000	383000	He also brought up an 80s adventure game that was only in Japan called Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken.
383000	385000	And, of course, Metal Gear Solid.
385000	389000	Of course. A little ego there. Anything else we'd recognize?
389000	391000	The Super Mario Bros. series?
391000	393000	Oh, Super Mario Bros. series. Sorry, I missed that.
393000	394000	Outerworld, Xevious?
394000	399000	Oh, okay. Sorry, I only picked up the last two for some reason. That's what I get for multitasking.
399000	405000	But, you know, actually, if Kojima is fouling up this other game that I've never played, then I think I'll have to give it a try.
405000	407000	I'll try to find out what it's on.
407000	411000	It's Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken.
411000	414000	So, what's up? Hideo Kojima talks. You listen?
414000	415000	Yes.
415000	417000	Alright. Fair enough.
417000	420000	Yeah, and I've bumped into him enough times that I think I should.
420000	422000	Awesome.
422000	427000	So, there's some interesting stuff coming out now.
427000	433000	PlayStation.com, I guess, was hacked according to a security firm's report.
433000	443000	The IT security firm Sophos reported that someone has been messing around with the official PlayStation site, the US one.
443000	454000	And, I guess, some of the messing around fits in with fake ads on the SingStar and God of War pages.
454000	462000	And trying to, I guess, I don't know, put viruses or spyware or something.
462000	467000	Were they trying to install spyware on people's computers? Were they trying to say, haha, we pwned Sony or what?
467000	478000	It says basically that the bogus pop-ups prompted people that saw them to purchase, I guess, what turned out to be bogus anti-virus software.
478000	483000	Dope. Oh my god, they put Gator on PlayStation.com.
483000	485000	Wow.
485000	490000	Apparently, though, Sony's already fixed the problem, but, you know.
490000	492000	That still sucks.
492000	498000	I would say, you know, if there was ever a list, and maybe we'll have to do this as a list list someday, even though it isn't directly video game related.
498000	505000	But if there was ever a list of, like, the most evil things to ever hit the internet, like the worst things to ever happen to the internet, Gator would be in the top three.
505000	507000	Absolutely.
507000	509000	BonziBuddy would be also in the top three.
509000	511000	Don't get me started on BonziBuddy.
511000	513000	YouTube.
513000	515000	Alright.
515000	521000	Anyhow, this is sad news in the Sony department. You cannot has Kratos in Soul Calibur IV.
521000	526000	That news was announced 1UP actually revealed at their most recent podcast because they've been playing the game.
526000	528000	Like you bastards.
528000	533000	They actually have the game there in studio because, you know, certain media people are more special-er than everybody else.
533000	535000	And so they've got it.
535000	542000	And they've been playing the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions and no Kratos to be found anywhere unless it was some type of last minute addition.
542000	548000	But let's see, if you think a big character like Kratos was going to be in a big game like this, do you think something would be a last minute addition?
548000	550000	Uh, download content.
550000	553000	Possibly. That could be, but I don't know.
553000	556000	I still say slim to none.
556000	558000	It would be, no, they could do that still.
558000	563000	I mean, as download content, and they could announce it at E3 if they want it to be a surprise.
563000	568000	Because they know better that certain media outlets out there, you know, especially if it leaks out.
568000	573000	Oh, hey, I saw Kratos in Soulcalibur 4 leak, you know, it's just...
573000	576000	Interesting. Alright, interesting thought.
576000	578000	Although I'm not that optimistic.
578000	582000	DarkSoccer, I know you and the Hubby were debating which version of Soulcalibur 4 you were going to get.
582000	584000	Did you finally come to a consensus?
584000	585000	360.
585000	586000	And why is that?
586000	587000	Online.
587000	588000	Oh, because the online...
588000	590000	Xbox Live is better. Sorry.
590000	595000	Do you think if Kratos had been in the Sony one, do you think that might have tilted you in the other direction?
595000	596000	Not at all.
596000	598000	Not at all. Not a Kratos fan?
598000	601000	No. I don't really... Honestly, I don't care.
601000	603000	Alright. Fair enough.
603000	605000	Did anybody check out Soulcalibur on Xbox Live this weekend?
605000	607000	I didn't hear anyone mention during their gaming weeks.
607000	611000	I only checked out the demo. I didn't feel good enough reviewing it based on the demo alone.
611000	614000	But it just seemed like the Dreamcast version.
614000	617000	No EXO. But not that that's bad, because the Dreamcast one was pretty awesome.
617000	618000	But there you have it.
618000	623000	Alright. Anyhow, here's some content where you guys get to contribute to our program.
623000	624000	It's the mailbag.
624000	626000	Every week you guys send us emails.
626000	633000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com and DarkSakura jumps into the emailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you here live on air.
633000	636000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com is the place to do it.
636000	639000	DarkSakura, rip it open. What do we got?
639000	646000	We've actually gotten a crap ton, so I'm very sorry for some of the emails that I am not answering.
646000	650000	I'm trying to get to ones that I haven't really read before.
650000	655000	No offense to the people who email us all the time. Let's hear from people we don't often hear from.
655000	663000	Let's see. I'm still actually going through them, so I'll start with this one.
663000	667000	Dear OLR team, my name is Simon and I live in Sweden.
667000	670000	I'm a first time writer to the show and I've listened for about three years.
670000	673000	I just wanted to tell you, you are the best and ask a question.
673000	678000	Unfortunately I live in a time zone where I can't listen live, so I have to make do with the podcast.
678000	681000	Which, by the way, is the best podcast on the web.
681000	684000	Anyway, why is part two released so late in the week nowadays?
684000	689000	I don't get part two until Friday night and most of the other stuff you talk about by then feels kind of outdated.
689000	694000	Not that I don't enjoy what you talk about, but is there a reason why it can't be released on Tuesday or Wednesday instead?
694000	699000	It's been kind of my fault recently because I've just been so busy on Tuesday and Wednesday nights specifically.
699000	702000	The ball's in my court to get that thing released.
702000	705000	And with my birthday on the 4th of July, especially these past two weeks, it has just been a madhouse.
705000	707000	So I apologize, that's not usually the plan.
707000	715000	The reason why we don't do it in, well, first off, we just kind of felt, we've been doing it in parts A and B ever since we were syndicated on all games.
715000	720000	And that's just kind of what we've grown used to and we like the fact that people would be getting two shows a week as opposed to just one.
720000	723000	Because, you know, we do a pretty darn long show here.
723000	729000	But the idea was to have it sooner in the week, at least 24 to 48 hours out from part A though.
729000	738000	And that's just because that way a lot of RSS audio grabbers will skip a file if you haven't already grabbed it.
738000	742000	Like let's say there's two new shows on the stream, it will only grab the most recent one.
742000	746000	And so people miss out on half the show if they're not updating every day.
746000	751000	So we try to space it out about 24, 48 hours to make sure people are getting each and every part.
751000	754000	And just to, you know, so that you have something spread out throughout the week.
754000	760000	Because most game shows release on Sunday, Monday. But much fewer of them release on Wednesday, Thursday.
760000	763000	So that was kind of the whole point about that.
763000	767000	So that's why we did it that way. So sorry it isn't a popular decision.
767000	773000	But you never know, especially with our 300th episode coming up and talk of already changing some other things about the show.
773000	776000	You never know, it might be one big show in the future. We'll see.
776000	779000	We reserve the right to change things as we want.
779000	783000	I'm also not reading part of this email though because it is directed toward somebody else.
783000	786000	But it says, thank you for an excellent show and take care.
786000	788000	And there you have it.
788000	794000	Okay, this one's from Rissimo, who I don't think I've ever read an email from.
794000	797000	The name sounds familiar but it's been a while.
797000	800000	Hello all, I beat Metal Gear Solid 4 a couple weeks ago.
800000	804000	Everyone used the word epic to describe the game. That's because there's no other word to describe it.
804000	806000	It's one of the best games I've ever played, seriously.
806000	811000	I'm sick of people bitching about games cutscenes and not talking about how great the actual game is.
811000	815000	There's so much diversity in the actual gameplay, I find this alarming.
815000	818000	I just want to know if any of you actually played it or just watched a bit.
818000	819000	I'm curious to know what you think.
819000	821000	Lastly, a couple of questions for Jamie.
821000	825000	Okay, did you watch any of the TV channels preceding the game?
825000	827000	Huh?
827000	829000	They're bizarre.
829000	833000	Okay, and did you see the one where David Hayter experiences the interview from hell?
833000	836000	And if you did, Fangasm much? I don't watch television.
836000	840000	I think, is it something like you leave the disc in and you see this random Easter egg stuff?
840000	845000	No, no, I didn't. Sorry. But I can.
845000	850000	Yeah, no, I thought that the game was very diverse in the things that allowed it.
850000	856000	But it's also, I guess this is up on YouTube, but no, never mind.
856000	863000	PS, I sent you guys a video months ago with my goddaughter playing my great 1000 mile rally arcade machine.
863000	868000	Then I purchased a Street Fighter II machine and I'm now eyeing a pinball table.
868000	871000	I have a lot of pinball in my youth, but don't remember many of the machines.
871000	877000	One of my customers owns a pinball boutique and suggested either a Black Knight or Addams Family machine is the best ever.
877000	879000	The Black Knight isn't too banged up, but it needs a bit of work.
879000	881000	Either one will cost me $2,000.
881000	886000	I have heard you rave about Black Knight pinball, but can't remember you talking about Addams Family one.
886000	889000	What says you? Thanks for getting me through this week.
889000	893000	First of all, there's a Black Knight and a Black Knight 2000.
893000	897000	And if it's Black Knight 2000, it's worthy, but I warn you, the game's a bitch.
897000	901000	It's hard. Addams Family is really, really, really fun.
901000	903000	I love Addams Family.
903000	909000	And I think that if you're looking for a starter machine, Addams Family is going to be the one to go with.
909000	916000	I think it's rec.pinball.something.
916000	924000	I'll have to find out the user group that my husband goes on and try to get you in touch with his group
924000	929000	because Dan started off on a really banged up machine and worked his way up.
929000	933000	$2,000 for an Addams Family? That's not bad.
933000	935000	At least as far as I've heard.
935000	947000	You're going to have to go ahead and start investing in rubbers and plastics and get carnauba wax for the boards.
947000	949000	What do I use that for? Oh, pinball.
949000	951000	For the actual boards themselves.
951000	956000	Make sure you've got Goo Gone handy and acid-free stuff because Rob.
956000	959000	I'm sorry, but I didn't know you were talking about pinball.
959000	961000	Rob, resist the urge.
961000	964000	I live in the gutter.
964000	968000	Just email me later.
968000	971000	Anyway.
971000	974000	Next email, and this actually is somebody different.
974000	976000	Hey, guys. Dan Shadow here.
976000	979000	While I was growing up, I had a lot of adventure and puzzle games to play.
979000	982000	Some of my favorites were the Monkey Island series, Loom.
982000	984000	Thank you! Loom is great.
984000	988000	King's Quest before 3D, Toonstruck the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour.
988000	991000	For the most part, those games were just point and clickers,
991000	994000	but they all had great dialogue and good puzzles that fit into the gameplay.
994000	997000	I mean, insult sword fighting was the best.
997000	999000	My question is a two-parter.
999000	1001000	Aside from games like Professor Layton and Hotel Dusk,
1001000	1004000	will we ever see a return of the good, plain, fun adventure game?
1004000	1007000	Part of the greatness of the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour
1007000	1009000	was that they were of a much darker tone.
1009000	1011000	Did you ever play Phantasmagoria?
1011000	1014000	Yes, I did play Phantasmagoria. It was awesome.
1014000	1018000	My second question is, if we do ever see more adventure games,
1018000	1021000	are they fated to be just childish games that will work for all ages?
1021000	1025000	Honestly, I would love to see another Phantasmagoria. Wouldn't that be awesome?
1025000	1027000	Seven CDs, that game was.
1027000	1028000	That game was epic.
1028000	1030000	I'd love to see another Monkey Island.
1030000	1032000	Only because the emailer isn't saying it,
1032000	1034000	I would hope to gosh you already know about it,
1034000	1037000	but Sam and Max, seriously, if you're not playing it,
1037000	1041000	this game was made for someone like you who loves these old 90s puzzlers.
1041000	1045000	And just the cool thing, and I hate sounding like a salesman for this service,
1045000	1047000	but I do like it. I honestly do.
1047000	1049000	GameTap has all these old-school PC games,
1049000	1051000	a lot of the ones you're talking about on there.
1051000	1054000	Rob, you fight like a dairy farmer.
1054000	1055000	Shut up.
1055000	1060000	Oh, Justin sent me an email that reminded me that the song I was trying to think of was Lab,
1060000	1064000	from 2DX8 style, that had the hearty hadoken.
1064000	1065000	Oh.
1065000	1067000	Well, I'm looking.
1067000	1068000	I'll have to dig it up.
1068000	1069000	8th style, Rob.
1069000	1071000	Oh, yeah, I got it.
1071000	1074000	We got an email from Sauce.
1074000	1075000	Okay.
1075000	1079000	It says, hi, Soess, which is my online nickname of the Saucers.
1079000	1082000	Skye, other guy, and DJ Ron, my guest.
1082000	1087000	Andrew, if he's there too.
1087000	1091000	Seeing how I know DarkSakura thoroughly enjoyed reading my lengthy multi-paragraph review
1091000	1093000	of the Iron Man video game released by Sony,
1093000	1097000	I thought it'd only be fair to review another game, Lego Indiana Jones.
1097000	1102000	But to be kind to her vocal cords rather than writing the review up here in this email,
1102000	1105000	I've written it up in my own blog and provided a link to paste into the chat room,
1105000	1107000	which I will in just a moment.
1107000	1111000	The journal, though, is marronmarvel.livejournal.com.
1111000	1114000	It's M-A-R-R-O-N, Marvel.
1114000	1117000	We will soon be writing for Orange Launch Radio when we get our new website done,
1117000	1120000	which is the next big task here at Camp O-L-R.
1120000	1122000	This is part of a project I'm working on for the O-L-R website.
1122000	1124000	It's obviously an aptly named project.
1124000	1126000	Update the website so more content can be added.
1126000	1127000	My bad.
1127000	1132000	But for now, the review sits on my own blog until Skye and I can get together and work something out.
1132000	1137000	The short version of the review is that Lego Indiana Jones is an extremely fun game
1137000	1139000	worth investing in for both kids and adults alike.
1139000	1144000	It comes on a variety of platforms, and I suggest playing it on DS or PSP over Xbox or Wii.
1144000	1147000	The feel of the game is much more to be enjoyed in small settings
1147000	1150000	between other things like classes on bus rides or what have you
1150000	1153000	than as a sit-in-front-of-the-TV console game.
1153000	1154000	Anyway, that's it for now.
1154000	1157000	I'm sure Dark Soccer has another dozen or so emails to read.
1157000	1158000	Keep up the great work, O-L-R.
1158000	1161000	Sincerely, your friendly neighborhood sauce.
1161000	1163000	Friendly neighborhood sauce. I like that. Very nice.
1163000	1164000	I have posted link in there.
1164000	1165000	And I love that she's dedicated.
1165000	1167000	I need someone like that to keep poking me and going,
1167000	1170000	website, website, website, but I'm really glad there's enthusiastic people.
1170000	1171000	I could do that, but I have sharp things to poke you with.
1171000	1172000	No, I don't like sharp things.
1172000	1174000	No, me no likey.
1174000	1177000	Well, if you keep poking me, then I am not going to give you.
1185000	1187000	This song was a bitch on 2DX. That's all I will say.
1187000	1188000	Fuck yeah, it was.
1192000	1194000	I think I beat it on 7 keys once and then I died.
1195000	1196000	There you have it.
1196000	1197000	That's lab.
1197000	1198000	That was lab.
1198000	1201000	Hey guys and gal, I've been listening to this show from us for years.
1201000	1204000	It is also the first podcast I have ever listened to,
1204000	1209000	but I have never been able to listen live because of school, family, etc.
1209000	1211000	Abandon them all. Just kidding.
1211000	1214000	My computer just became unplugged, give me a second.
1214000	1215000	Dope.
1215000	1217000	There's one thing I really want to know that you guys have never said,
1217000	1219000	you're gamertags.
1219000	1222000	I understand if you don't want to share them because of privacy and stuff,
1222000	1226000	but it would be great to actually play on live with one of you guys
1226000	1231000	and maybe even work on Loki at GTA IV cough.
1231000	1235000	Love this show and keep up the good work from Taco4Brain,
1235000	1237000	which is my gamertag by the way.
1237000	1241000	PS, Imagine Babies would have been a lot better with Harpoon's Fire and Dragon Force.
1243000	1246000	This is going to sound so horrible, but I don't know any other way to put it.
1246000	1249000	The sad thing is my list, I don't have a problem giving my gamertag out
1249000	1252000	because it's on the forums, it's green sky, but it's S-K-I-E.
1252000	1253000	All one word.
1253000	1256000	But here's the problem, is that my friends list is completely full.
1256000	1262000	And Microsoft does not address the issue about letting us expand our friends list yet.
1262000	1266000	And I try to when new OLR listeners want to be added,
1266000	1270000	I go in my list and I look for people who haven't signed on in like a week
1270000	1272000	and I'll delete them, but the problem is I'm trying to balance,
1272000	1275000	like I don't want to delete anybody I know offline,
1275000	1277000	but I also don't want to make any OLR listeners sad,
1277000	1282000	so I'm having to play this really delicate balancing game with the friend list.
1282000	1284000	So you can send me a friend request.
1284000	1288000	I guess I could delete someone who hasn't signed on in a week, but it's tough.
1288000	1291000	Please don't be hurt if I defriend you or refuse your friend request.
1291000	1293000	I'm just full.
1293000	1295000	And I'm not even on Xbox that often.
1295000	1296000	Stop.
1296000	1298000	I'm still waiting on my request.
1298000	1300000	Didn't I accept it?
1300000	1302000	It bounced back saying it was full.
1302000	1305000	Oh, you got to like call me or text me and say I'm going to try to add you
1305000	1308000	and then I'll dump somebody who hasn't signed on in a week and then add you.
1308000	1309000	How about after the show maybe?
1309000	1310000	Alright, we'll do that.
1310000	1311000	Cool.
1311000	1312000	We'll do that after the show.
1312000	1313000	I'm sorry.
1313000	1314000	It's okay.
1314000	1316000	On the same subject, my We Connect 24 is now working.
1316000	1317000	Nice.
1317000	1319000	So if you want to add me.
1319000	1322000	And it's all in the forum, because you don't know your friend code I would imagine.
1322000	1323000	Not that I can.
1323000	1326000	But it's all in the friend's code thread on forums.
1326000	1328000	Or no, orange.radio.com, click on forums.
1328000	1329000	Yes.
1329000	1330000	There you have it.
1330000	1332000	On a similar related note, I don't have a 360,
1332000	1334000	so I naturally don't have a gamertag,
1334000	1337000	but I am in the O.L. Army clown on X-Fire,
1337000	1342000	so if you want to pop on and own my asset like Day of Defeat Source or Counter-Strike,
1342000	1343000	feel free.
1343000	1344000	It's in the forums.
1344000	1347000	Check the thread there under PC Games.
1347000	1349000	See, Fear the Claw in chat says,
1349000	1350000	Aw, how sad.
1350000	1351000	Sky has too many friends.
1351000	1352000	Cry face.
1352000	1356000	I hate, I feel like I sound like a stuck up ass when I say that.
1356000	1357000	Rob.
1357000	1358000	What?
1358000	1359000	You are a whore darling.
1359000	1361000	I'm sorry.
1361000	1363000	I just, you know, I.
1363000	1364000	Okay.
1364000	1365000	Emails, please.
1365000	1366000	It is what it is.
1366000	1367000	All right, what?
1367000	1371000	I'm going to quickly go through some of these and paraphrase them.
1371000	1378000	GS68, who introduces himself in English, Spanish, and Japanese.
1378000	1379000	Ola.
1379000	1382000	Wanted to know what happened to the guy who said the geeks in Otaku
1382000	1385000	were the only ones who wanted more storage space,
1385000	1391000	and said that it's sad that Representative Nintendo would have to, you know,
1391000	1393000	hold to a level of professionalism and didn't.
1393000	1397000	Well, you haven't heard from him lately, so that's hopefully a good sign.
1397000	1398000	Thumbs up, Nintendo.
1398000	1399000	He liked the interview.
1399000	1400000	Good.
1400000	1405000	And wants us to come to Final Mate 2009, which will be a likely.
1405000	1406000	Most likely, yeah.
1406000	1408000	Outlook good on the Magic 8 Ball.
1408000	1414000	And says, this email was brought to you by Sizzler Home of the Endless Salads.
1414000	1417000	By the way, California Extremes in two weeks starts soccer.
1417000	1418000	I'm going.
1418000	1419000	Do we want to check out there?
1419000	1420000	Fuck yeah.
1420000	1421000	You have room in your car for one more?
1421000	1422000	Sure.
1422000	1423000	All right.
1423000	1424000	You're only going for the one day, right?
1424000	1425000	You're not going to stay overnight or anything?
1425000	1427000	I don't think we're going to stay overnight, but we might go back.
1427000	1428000	Okay.
1428000	1429000	I might just go for one day.
1429000	1431000	I think we're going to do the Saturday.
1431000	1433000	Honestly, I think I'd only be able to stay in the one day.
1433000	1434000	Yeah, I think we'll both go on Saturday.
1434000	1435000	It'll be fine.
1435000	1436000	I'll come with if you don't mind the extra room.
1436000	1437000	Go for it.
1437000	1438000	All right.
1438000	1440000	OLR car trip.
1440000	1442000	Anyway, short email from Salt Tech.
1442000	1445000	Hey, OLR, I was learning if anyone, including chat,
1445000	1449000	knows anything about whether Diablo 3 will be pay-to-play like World of Warcraft
1449000	1452000	or buy the game like Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 anyway.
1452000	1453000	Love the show.
1453000	1455000	I'm glad to hear you like the email address.
1455000	1458000	It's actually supposed to be 666% pure evil,
1458000	1461000	but you can't use the percent character in email addresses,
1461000	1463000	so it ended up with being what it is now.
1463000	1464000	Keep up the great work.
1464000	1466000	Also, periods help.
1466000	1470000	So far as I know, and this comes as a Blizzard fan,
1470000	1474000	it's going to be pay-once-and-play, just standard Battle.net model.
1474000	1475000	Why not?
1475000	1476000	Diablo 2 is the same way.
1476000	1478000	I mean, if Blizzard were to change it now,
1478000	1481000	they'd just be getting greedy, bastards.
1481000	1485000	But I don't think that's going to be the case.
1485000	1489000	At any rate, next email is,
1489000	1491000	hey, I'm sorry, dear OLR,
1491000	1493000	hi, you guys are awesome.
1493000	1496000	Anyway, I remember I was listening to you guys one time,
1496000	1499000	how you said you can't find awesome arcades anymore, cry.
1499000	1500000	But there's still one, kind of.
1500000	1504000	Well, I live in Houston, Texas, and we have this anime arcade.
1504000	1505000	When I found out about this arcade, I was like,
1505000	1508000	OMG, Houston has something cool?
1508000	1510000	So I made my parents take me there with a friend,
1510000	1512000	and we were all like, where is it?
1512000	1514000	But just when we were about to give up, my mom was all like,
1514000	1515000	hey, is that it?
1515000	1517000	And I'm like, yes, it is.
1517000	1519000	So we take a look inside, and my parents all confused
1519000	1523000	because they aren't otaku, and it was awesome.
1523000	1525000	It was called Planet Zero.
1525000	1526000	And I was so happy I almost cried
1526000	1529000	because they had imported games such as popin' music.
1529000	1530000	Yay.
1530000	1534000	The only thing that really, really sucked was that the arcade was small,
1534000	1535000	but that's okay.
1535000	1536000	It's still cool.
1536000	1538000	Well, thank you for taking the time to read this story.
1538000	1539000	It's long.
1539000	1543000	LOL, your friend Isabelle.
1543000	1546000	But it's signed as ro.
1546000	1547000	Last email.
1547000	1549000	It is a long one.
1549000	1550000	All right.
1550000	1551000	Long email is long.
1551000	1554000	But this one is special because of their ISP,
1554000	1556000	which I think is funny.
1556000	1557000	I'm not going to say.
1557000	1558000	Oh, we can't say the...
1558000	1560000	Oh, okay.
1560000	1565000	Well, actually, I'm pretty sure that the name is pronounced Nige
1565000	1568000	just as a nickname.
1568000	1569000	All right.
1569000	1572000	I always think about this one song that has the name
1572000	1576000	of this supermarket chain in the title.
1576000	1578000	Anyway.
1578000	1579000	All right.
1579000	1580000	Read the email.
1580000	1582000	Fine.
1582000	1584000	Dear OLR,
1584000	1587000	I finally had my first sustained encounter with the PSP last week
1587000	1590000	after years of getting my gaming fix on a Nintendo system.
1590000	1592000	And I was very surprised how much I liked it.
1592000	1595000	The public perception of Sony's computer entertainment strategy
1595000	1598000	at the moment generally seems to be one of the companies
1598000	1601000	suffering a midterm malaise, much like Nintendo went through
1601000	1606000	after the year of the 16-bit era until the Wii slash DS combo.
1606000	1609000	As you always rightly say, it's all about the games.
1609000	1612000	And although there were a handful of interesting titles in the PSP,
1612000	1615000	it never really grabbed my attention until Crisis Core arrived in Europe.
1615000	1619000	As my girlfriend has a PSP, I decided to buy the game and give it a go.
1619000	1621000	The game itself is very good.
1621000	1624000	I have to disagree with Logie's comments a couple episodes back.
1624000	1626000	I find it very entertaining.
1626000	1628000	Part of the reason for this personally, I feel,
1628000	1631000	is because I've been out of the Final Fantasy universe for so long.
1631000	1633000	I played Final Fantasy Tactics on GBA,
1633000	1635000	the Kratty Crystal Chronicles spin-offs,
1635000	1638000	and the Boring Revenant Wings game on the DS,
1638000	1640000	along with some of the mundane remakes,
1640000	1643000	but not any of the console games since Final Fantasy IX.
1643000	1646000	I really like the art style and the more fluid battle mechanics
1646000	1651000	that appears to have replaced the original turn-based system.
1651000	1654000	I also think that the mission structure fits the portability of the PSP.
1654000	1657000	I can pick up the game and play a mission for five minutes
1657000	1660000	whilst in a shop or sitting on the toilet hem,
1660000	1663000	and then can put it down again.
1663000	1667000	I had told you I keep a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the bathroom.
1667000	1670000	When I'm ready to spend time with the story,
1670000	1673000	then I can get bogged down in wasting an hour or two,
1673000	1675000	but when I'm ready.
1675000	1677000	Anyway, that's not my main point.
1677000	1681000	Accessing the PSP has been like opening a shiny door in my head.
1681000	1682000	That's nice.
1682000	1684000	What a wonderful product.
1684000	1688000	With all that functionality, it really is a media center in your pocket.
1688000	1690000	I guess it could be argued that Sony's insistence
1690000	1693000	on turning their game machines into home computers
1693000	1696000	may have been something of a flaw in their strategy,
1696000	1698000	but then this is also the first week
1698000	1700000	that I have been listening to the OLR podcast
1700000	1702000	out in the sunshine on a PSP
1702000	1704000	before catching up on other RSS feeds
1704000	1707000	that I regularly check out on my desktop PC,
1707000	1709000	which I couldn't do on my DS.
1709000	1712000	And thank you for making us your first priority this week.
1712000	1716000	There are pros and cons to any product in a competitive marketplace.
1716000	1721000	The opportunity cost of the next best alternative
1721000	1723000	will always be subjective.
1723000	1729000	However, with Nintendo's seemingly lackluster provision of mature,
1729000	1731000	and by that design I don't necessarily mean emirated,
1731000	1735000	just intelligent grown-up design versus the likes of Imagine Baby's titles,
1735000	1738000	and the lack of desire to provide choice,
1738000	1740000	Goodbye Freeloader and region-free gaming,
1740000	1744000	the historic poor strategic vision in PAL territories,
1744000	1748000	and of course the fact that we are seen to be geeks in Otaku,
1748000	1751000	I'm starting to feel marginalized by Nintendo,
1751000	1753000	who I once championed so much,
1753000	1756000	it seems ironic that in the moment of their greatest commercial success,
1756000	1759000	I find myself completely disinterested by what they have to offer.
1759000	1765000	It may have something to do with my age,
1765000	1768000	and my gaming habits,
1768000	1770000	but I am, or rather have been, a loyal customer,
1770000	1772000	and I do agree with you, and I'm not much older than you.
1772000	1775000	My girlfriend, the PSP owner,
1775000	1778000	who fits the historic profile of a traditional European gamer,
1778000	1782000	having been raised on PC and home computer gaming scene
1782000	1784000	in the late 80s and early 90s,
1784000	1787000	rather than foreign consoles, asked Kropotkin for more info,
1787000	1791000	summed it up neatly for me recently.
1791000	1794000	You were once their target market, but not anymore.
1794000	1797000	I guess it really is that simple.
1797000	1802000	What the Nintendo marketing executive said with their vision really is,
1802000	1804000	and I'm fine with that.
1804000	1806000	They are opening up gaming to a broader audience,
1806000	1808000	making it socially acceptable lifestyle activity.
1808000	1812000	You just have to look at all of those unrealistically happy generations of families
1812000	1815000	in their TV commercials to get a sense of that.
1815000	1819000	Who would have thought Granny would ever get so enthused by virtual puppies
1819000	1821000	and Sudoku puzzles whilst bonding with their grandchildren
1821000	1825000	on an expensive nuclear family vacation to an unspecified exotic location?
1825000	1828000	So why am I bothering to say anything at all?
1828000	1831000	I just want Nintendo to know that,
1831000	1834000	thanks largely to the production of the must-want titles
1834000	1839000	by their competitors and tepid treatment of their customer base,
1839000	1843000	a personal tipping point has finally been reached.
1843000	1846000	I'm in the market for a PSP Slim and a PS3 now.
1846000	1849000	My Wii is gathering dust, my DS gets the occasional play,
1849000	1852000	and I think I'm not alone.
1852000	1855000	Very interesting quote in there, something about,
1855000	1858000	you were the target audience, but not anymore.
1858000	1862000	It kind of hurts to hear, but I think your girlfriend's on to something with that.
1862000	1864000	Was that his quote or the girlfriend? I don't remember.
1864000	1867000	But whoever said that is definitely on to something.
1867000	1872000	Kind of sad, but I think something the hardcore gaming fans forget once in a while,
1872000	1876000	like, OMG, Nintendo, how could you screw us over like this?
1876000	1880000	Well, it was so much better when it was 8-bit.
1880000	1882000	Well, it's not 8-bit anymore.
1882000	1885000	We're not 13 anymore, you know?
1885000	1887000	That was the last one I'm reading.
1887000	1892000	And I'm sorry to everybody else that I skipped over, you know,
1892000	1894000	I had a shit ton of emails.
1894000	1896000	But there's always next week. Mailbag at orangeontrudy.com.
1896000	1900000	Yeah, I'm leaving the ones I haven't read as unread.
1900000	1904000	And maybe we'll post some on the forums and respond to them there, you never know.
1904000	1905000	Maybe.
1905000	1906000	We'll see.
1906000	1910000	Alright, mailbag at orangeontrudy.com if you'd like to contribute to Dark Soccer's massive emails.
1910000	1911000	There you go.
1911000	1913000	Alright, back to some gaming news, eh, Loki?
1913000	1920000	Yes. Well, let's see, there was an interesting rumor that came out this week.
1920000	1929000	About a 60GB Xbox 360 Pro model that's supposedly going to be announced at E3.
1929000	1940000	It's interesting because, you know, this is around the same time that we've been seeing retailer ads for a 20GB model being dropped down to $299.
1940000	1945000	And, of course, as usual, this is a rumor.
1945000	1949000	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
1949000	1954000	And who knows if it's true.
1954000	1959000	But yeah, I guess we'll just have to wait until E3 to see if it's true.
1959000	1964000	But boy, wouldn't E3 be a really good time to announce something like this?
1964000	1969000	Yeah, that would be a very good time to announce something like this.
1969000	1975000	And don't you think you'd have to tell all these people in advance what you're doing and just pray the news doesn't get out there like it has been?
1975000	1979000	Yeah, that would, you know, a lot of trust in the industry there.
1979000	1995000	And, you know, it would really suck if it seems like some of these websites like Ars Technica would happen to leak an email that, you know, was sent out by Microsoft detailing exactly what they were going to be talking about at E3.
1995000	1996000	Quandary.
1996000	2000000	Yes, that's really sad.
2000000	2001000	Really sad.
2001000	2004000	But we're sure that that wouldn't happen, right?
2004000	2005000	That would never happen.
2005000	2007000	Not at all.
2007000	2014000	But, you know, hey, these Microsoft rumors, they're never true.
2014000	2022000	Well, now, something else we can either confirm nor deny, and really we're in the dark about this one, is Halo.
2022000	2035000	Here's the interesting thing. It's an article that's being run on computer and video games, that website, and it's apparently also coming from Sarcastic Gamer, which is another podcast, and their own internal quote-unquote sources.
2035000	2040000	Apparently there is a new Halo game that is going to be unveiled at E3.
2040000	2047000	Here's the thing, though. It could be Peter Jackson's game, but the interesting thing about it, it will not have the Master Chief in it.
2047000	2051000	So could the Halo franchise survive without Master Chief?
2051000	2059000	I don't know. I forgot to mention, too, as part of that story, the 20 gig model is rumored to being phased out with this price drop.
2059000	2067000	You may remember last year, I believe, when the 80 gig came out, they dropped the price of the 60 gig also for the PS3.
2067000	2068000	Same type of thing.
2068000	2071000	But we would have no idea if that is actually happening.
2071000	2076000	Yes, we would have absolutely no idea that something like that would actually be happening.
2076000	2077000	Right.
2077000	2085000	A question for our guests in the studio, since we haven't heard from you in a little bit. Could Halo work without Master Chief?
2085000	2087000	Ask someone who fucking cares.
2087000	2088000	Alright, then.
2088000	2091000	Well, they have Halo Wars, and I'm pretty sure Master Chief's not in that.
2091000	2092000	Why not?
2092000	2095000	Tell a game about Cortana.
2095000	2099000	A game centered around Cortana? Okay, maybe. Maybe. Alright, getting warmer.
2099000	2101000	Rama, any thoughts?
2101000	2104000	I could give two shits about Halo, really.
2104000	2106000	You know what would be awesome? Red vs. Blue, the game.
2106000	2110000	That'll work. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
2110000	2111000	Rabble, rabble.
2111000	2112000	I would play sister.
2112000	2118000	They could do a Halo game without Master Chief, but that's like a Halloween movie without Jamie Lee Curtis.
2118000	2122000	It's just destined not to be as good. Come on. Come on.
2122000	2123000	Alright.
2123000	2124000	That broke me.
2124000	2125000	That broke you?
2125000	2126000	Yes.
2126000	2127000	Syntax error.
2127000	2131000	I think it would be with the Arbiter.
2131000	2136000	Who knows? E3, we'll find out, but I can't believe that Halo would be a franchise.
2136000	2139000	Microsoft would just like, go away into the sunset.
2139000	2142000	It'll be back one way or another. We'll see.
2142000	2145000	Well, this makes me plenty happy.
2145000	2154000	A new zombie smacking mini game is coming out called The House of the Dead EX.
2154000	2162000	It's zombie love, zombie rock, zombie bowling, zombie whacking, zombie shooting.
2162000	2163000	Zombie whacking?
2163000	2165000	Yep, some zombie love.
2165000	2178000	But it's actually, I do believe, it has a lot to use the guns or this sort of pedal that's on it, like in Time Crisis.
2178000	2186000	But it's an arcade machine, and it's also in a really cutesy, kind of bizarro, cel-shaded anime style.
2186000	2192000	It's the cel-shaded, sort of like how House of the Dead 3 was, but it's just cute.
2192000	2196000	Well, House of the Dead 3 was supposed to be cel-shaded anyway.
2196000	2201000	But it's a light gun game, and it has pedal, and it's House of the Dead EX.
2201000	2202000	Cute.
2202000	2208000	I don't think zombies and cute should ever be in the same sentence, unless you have a knot in there, but...
2208000	2210000	Yeah, I don't know.
2210000	2211000	It sounds like...
2211000	2214000	And then will Ubi Bol be basing a new movie based on that too?
2214000	2215000	No.
2215000	2216000	Where the zombies are like in love?
2216000	2217000	I'm thinking no.
2217000	2219000	I think Ubi Bol will be a zombie in the game.
2219000	2221000	Don't go there. For the love of God, don't go there.
2221000	2223000	Maybe a boss. I think he should be a boss.
2223000	2224000	There you go.
2224000	2227000	Zombies got talent, says his fan to listen to chat.
2227000	2231000	Now they're just doing all these zombie things in chat.
2231000	2239000	Well, not to sound like, as Rob put it earlier, advertising for GameTap.
2239000	2246000	But, GameTap is going to be putting up American McGee's Grimm pretty soon.
2246000	2252000	And one thing they're going to be doing that's a little bit different is that each episode will be free,
2252000	2257000	or be a free download, and remain a free download for a 24 hour period.
2257000	2266000	After that, each episode will go into GameTap's archives and be available to download individual for a yet to be determined price.
2266000	2269000	Where the fuck is Alice, by the way?
2269000	2272000	We need an American McGee game. We need Alice.
2272000	2274000	Is that not on GameTap yet? I thought it was.
2274000	2276000	I have not seen Alice on GameTap.
2276000	2278000	It's probably coming. You can bet that if this game...
2278000	2282000	They're probably waiting until like a month before or something. We'll see.
2282000	2289000	So, these will all... I guess the first one is going to debut on July 31st.
2289000	2294000	And it's going to be called A Boy Who... A Boy Learns What Fear Is.
2294000	2297000	Oh my. Sounds a little scary.
2297000	2303000	Well, changing gears here and moving on to something completely different.
2303000	2312000	You know when this music plays, the news is not going to be good, folks.
2312000	2318000	You heard that when the Sony PlayStation 3 launched, you heard all sorts of crazy shit happen.
2318000	2325000	People were getting shot up in line. People were getting the Sony PlayStation 3 stolen from them right out of their hands.
2325000	2329000	But now, kids, we have reached the lowest of the low.
2329000	2335000	And it didn't even happen in the U.S. It happened in Australia.
2335000	2339000	I thought everyone got along in Australia, but no, this is how horrible it is.
2339000	2347000	Zach Tooey... I apologize if I mispronounce that, but Zach Tooey, unfortunately, he has a form of muscular dystrophy.
2347000	2350000	And he is confined in a wheelchair for most of his life.
2350000	2354000	He was able to get something from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
2354000	2359000	And Zach opted to get a PlayStation 3 from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which, by the way, is a great charity.
2359000	2362000	I've helped raise money for them before. They're a wonderful, wonderful charity.
2362000	2371000	Here's the thing. The charity got him the PlayStation 3, got him the games, and this week, thieves broke into his home and stole everything.
2371000	2375000	Jewelry, appliances, PlayStation 3, and all the games.
2375000	2377000	Fuckers!
2377000	2379000	Maybe his wish was to be mugged.
2379000	2386000	I don't think so. I think, uh, this is one of those things where I would say, this country's going to hell, but, uh, unfortunately, it didn't happen here.
2386000	2389000	This world's going to hell. Congratulations, everybody.
2389000	2392000	But then again, it's Australia. We didn't see that coming.
2392000	2397000	No, no, no. There's a lot of nice people living in the land of upside-down-ness.
2397000	2399000	Yeah, you don't want to go there.
2399000	2401000	I think, yeah, don't go there, girlfriend.
2401000	2410000	All right. So, obviously, that's, uh, that's about 99 different ways of fucked up, and we will count them out for you right now.
2410000	2414000	Or at least give you our FUs of the week.
2414000	2422000	Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
2422000	2424000	This is fucked up!
2424000	2426000	That's Sakura.
2426000	2434000	FU to the 580. And, um, FU to the asshole.
2434000	2436000	You know, FU getting pulled over.
2436000	2438000	Snap.
2438000	2442000	I got pulled over at the, uh, Sacramento airport.
2442000	2449000	Um, first of all, I was dead tired, exhausted after having driven most of the day and wandering all over the city.
2449000	2452000	Well, all over Virginia County and Berkeley and all this.
2452000	2458000	And we talked to the AMPM there, and I had to circle back around so I could actually get back there to get some coffee.
2458000	2466000	And I ended up pulling out and going to the Garden Highway and some to the exit on the 5 going, you know, trying to find my way out.
2466000	2470000	And I got pulled over, and my tags, um, need renewing.
2470000	2475000	But they wanted to search the trunk and do all this stuff, and it turned out...
2475000	2476000	Damn!
2476000	2480000	It turned out that, um, they were looking for someone.
2480000	2484000	They were asking all of our IDs and checking everything, but they left me off in the morning.
2484000	2487000	Were they looking for someone that looks like you? Of all things?
2487000	2491000	I don't know, but it was my evil twin Skippy.
2491000	2493000	Wow.
2493000	2495000	I like how you have an evil twin named Skippy.
2495000	2497000	Skippy Sakura. Dark Skippy.
2497000	2499000	Light Sakura. It was Light Sakura.
2499000	2510000	No. But, um, but, uh, you know, one of the names for evil Sakura is Hiakeshika Sakura, which is lumber?
2510000	2512000	Does Skippy have a mustache like Evil Spock?
2512000	2513000	No.
2513000	2514000	Alright.
2514000	2516000	No!
2516000	2518000	Alright, I'm sorry. Anything else Dark Sakura?
2518000	2519000	Yes!
2519000	2520000	Okay.
2520000	2523000	You didn't give me a ticket. I got to go.
2523000	2531000	And then we heard, we heard, uh, a sort of, uh, yelling fight at the Chevron station, which was stupid.
2531000	2532000	Nice.
2532000	2539000	I said, man, people, if you're going to argue with somebody and talk shit, no one else cares to hear your fucking nonsense.
2539000	2545000	Go keep it to yourselves or talk somewhere like civil human beings and say,
2545000	2547000	That bitch!
2547000	2549000	You know.
2549000	2551000	Be civil.
2551000	2553000	Be mature.
2553000	2556000	I'm sorry. Game Guru corrected me. Evil Spock had a beard, not a mustache.
2556000	2559000	Sorry, nerd Trekkie. I'm just kidding.
2559000	2560000	So rude.
2560000	2563000	But, but, but, but, but, also, also one last thing.
2563000	2568000	A semi-F you to the ending of Doctor Who.
2568000	2571000	The season ending of Doctor Who.
2571000	2573000	Because it was sort of a cop-out.
2573000	2579000	And it was, as a, as a fangirl, I did have my fangasm, and I'm sorry.
2579000	2584000	I want to look as good as Liz Sladen when I am 60 years old.
2584000	2587000	Because that woman is gorgeous.
2587000	2591000	But, um, but it was, it was, it was a bit of happy at the end.
2591000	2593000	Just a little cop-y-outy.
2593000	2594000	Just a little cop-y-outy.
2594000	2599000	But I'm wondering, there's two people who are, I don't want to spoil it.
2599000	2601000	I don't want to spoil it. I'm not gonna.
2601000	2605000	Just, ahhh!
2605000	2607000	Fangirlism.
2607000	2608000	Next.
2608000	2610000	Um, let's see.
2610000	2614000	I would have said F you to, um, programming.
2614000	2617000	But I don't have reason to do that anymore.
2617000	2621000	Um, so I'm gonna say F you to my car being in the shop still.
2621000	2628000	Um, unfortunately the, I guess, thermostat housing is, um, busted and leaking coolant.
2628000	2631000	So I took it in on the 4th of July.
2631000	2636000	And, um, unfortunately the dealership was closed.
2636000	2639000	And they were unable to fix it.
2639000	2644000	So now I have to wait for my car until Monday when the dealership is open.
2644000	2647000	Because that's, um, the only place that has a part.
2647000	2649000	So that sucks.
2649000	2653000	Even though I could have driven my car, you know, leaking coolant, as I've been doing.
2653000	2655000	Ah, it might not have been, it might not have been fun.
2655000	2659000	It was alright, but, you know, um, I just want to get it fixed.
2659000	2661000	Alright, let's keep the F yous moving.
2661000	2662000	I'm gonna make mine quick.
2662000	2663000	F you to drama.
2663000	2665000	F you to unnecessary drama.
2665000	2667000	It's sad.
2667000	2669000	Makes me pain in places I didn't know I had.
2669000	2670000	Rama!
2670000	2672000	Which rhymes with drama.
2672000	2674000	Rama drama.
2674000	2676000	But that should be a podcast you should do.
2676000	2677000	Rama drama.
2677000	2679000	Rama does not rhyme with drama.
2679000	2684000	I know, I'm just, in my real ghetto, don't know how to speak thing.
2684000	2687000	Okay, drama llama rama.
2687000	2689000	I'm going to let that one slide.
2689000	2693000	You should have a podcast where you just talk about drama in the cosplay world.
2693000	2694000	I bet it's hilarious.
2694000	2696000	Oh, I do slip some in there from time to time.
2696000	2697000	Alright, F yous of the week.
2697000	2698000	I need to stop.
2698000	2699000	F yous of the week.
2699000	2704000	First, F you to people who have made my vacation a living hell that started off.
2704000	2706000	I don't need to hear from you.
2706000	2707000	Leave me alone.
2707000	2710000	Second F you to Continental Airlines.
2710000	2718000	Yes, my friend will help me out, but still, I don't want to be stuck in Texas for nine hours.
2718000	2719000	Okay?
2719000	2721000	At George Bush?
2721000	2722000	Yeah.
2722000	2723000	What the hell?
2723000	2727000	And your luggage went to New Orleans, which sounds so much like Sacramento.
2727000	2731000	But your luggage did come back from its early Mardi Gras, like Saw said.
2731000	2736000	Yeah, but the thing is, when I opened up the bag, there was no tequila, no alcohol, no nothing.
2736000	2737000	That's an evil bag.
2737000	2738000	Or boobs.
2738000	2739000	Exactly, not even beads.
2739000	2740000	I mean, really.
2740000	2745000	All there was was, you know, parts of Hurricane Katrina and...
2745000	2747000	Boo, too soon.
2747000	2749000	No, dude, no.
2749000	2751000	Alright, Dark Tetsuya.
2751000	2753000	Ah, fuck this heat.
2753000	2754000	Oh my god.
2754000	2755000	Yeah, fuck the heat.
2755000	2756000	I'm dying.
2756000	2757000	I am dying, too.
2757000	2758000	Oh, sorry.
2758000	2759000	Oh.
2759000	2761000	You gotta give him nice, loud, hearty, fuck the heat.
2761000	2762000	Sorry, yeah.
2762000	2763000	Fuck this heat.
2763000	2764000	There you go.
2764000	2765000	A little better.
2765000	2766000	Alright.
2766000	2767000	Yeah, I'll second the fuck you to the heat.
2767000	2769000	I'll second the fuck you to drama.
2769000	2774000	Fuck you to Ubisoft for not making sure that a game works before they push it out the door.
2774000	2782000	Speaking of, of course, Ghost Recon, Assault Warfighter 2, which decides to crash as soon as I load a level.
2782000	2787000	FU not being able to drive yet, not being able to learn to drive yet, because of this heat.
2787000	2793000	Because the car is way too fucking hot by the time I get in it, and it's been driven in a while, so fuck that shit.
2793000	2800000	And just fuck waiting around for people to look at resume shit.
2800000	2803000	Driving me crazy.
2803000	2804000	Alright.
2804000	2805000	That's gonna do it for the FUs of the Week.
2805000	2810000	It was kinda long tonight, but we had a lot of angst here in studio, which makes up for some of the weeks past where we didn't have that much angst.
2810000	2811000	So there you have it.
2811000	2817000	But now we need to change the tone here in studio a little bit, because we got Match Game coming up, so I need something a little bit lighter fare.
2817000	2822000	And believe it or not, of all people, I'm gonna turn to Jamie for something a little lighter fare.
2822000	2826000	Death, death, blood, shit, and puke.
2826000	2827000	Not helping.
2827000	2829000	And cornflakes.
2829000	2855000	Okay. In actual news, I really have to give it to the male population of Canada, because there is a study that has come out, a survey actually that Microsoft put out, wondering how many, well out of a thousand gamers in Canada, how many of them play naked?
2855000	2858000	And this is something we really needed to know.
2858000	2863000	This was like, you know, scientifically sensitive, you know, we need to know this information.
2863000	2872000	17% of men game naked, and 9% of women game naked.
2872000	2876000	Like all the time, or just have once in a while? Or like have before?
2876000	2880000	I don't know, but get plastic wrap for your controller, please.
2880000	2882000	So here's my question.
2882000	2887000	They say this about Canadian gamers, but I'm wondering if it's true about American gamers.
2887000	2891000	Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm wondering something here.
2891000	2897000	I wonder if the people who took the survey counted, say, taking a handheld into the bathroom as gaming naked.
2897000	2898000	I don't know about that.
2898000	2901000	It's a valid question. It's a valid question.
2901000	2906000	Okay, outside of the handheld in the bathroom, who has ever game naked? Darkside, have you ever game naked?
2906000	2908000	Yes, I have.
2908000	2911000	Do you remember what game?
2911000	2914000	Well, first of all, I was running a fever of 103.
2914000	2915000	Okay.
2915000	2916000	It probably wasn't DDR.
2916000	2920000	No, it was actually Super Mario 3, I think. No, it was before that.
2920000	2921000	I think it was Top Gun.
2921000	2922000	Nice.
2922000	2924000	Loki, have you ever game naked?
2924000	2926000	I always game naked under my clothes.
2926000	2928000	No, really? No, really?
2928000	2929000	No, no, I haven't.
2929000	2931000	Okay, so we're 50% so far.
2931000	2933000	Romba, ever game naked?
2933000	2938000	Normally my lawyer would tell me not to answer, but yeah.
2938000	2942000	And it was Dance Dance Revolution.
2942000	2943000	That's the limit, no.
2943000	2947000	Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Me too.
2947000	2948000	Wait.
2948000	2953000	When I was done, there was a bunch of fangirls outside wanting my autograph with the other pen.
2953000	2955000	I didn't do it in a public setting.
2955000	2957000	I'm sorry?
2957000	2958000	You have to try it.
2958000	2962000	I was in my own house. I didn't know the window. I wasn't looking.
2962000	2963000	Close the shades.
2963000	2964000	Alright, alright.
2964000	2966000	I denied a fangirl what they wanted.
2966000	2967000	Drew?
2967000	2968000	Drew?
2968000	2969000	To make them want it more.
2969000	2971000	Drew, have you ever game nude?
2971000	2975000	I have to say, with all confidence, I have not. I don't plan to.
2975000	2979000	I've lied naked in the bed playing PSP.
2979000	2980000	Alright.
2980000	2981000	Dark Tetsuya?
2981000	2983000	I know.
2983000	2985000	But here, look at that.
2985000	2991000	I just want to say, out of the studio, even though we're including men and women because dark soccer is here,
2991000	2993000	three of us have game nude, three of us have not.
2993000	2996000	That means 50% of Americans have game naked, so take that Canada.
2996000	2998000	That's why you can never trust a poll.
2998000	2999000	Take that.
2999000	3003000	The numbers are manipulated by the ones who ask the questions.
3003000	3006000	Alright. Anyhow, so there you have it.
3006000	3009000	Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?
3009000	3010000	Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?
3010000	3015000	Now that we've thoroughly grossed out the chat room, Shadow Slider says, game naked. What kind of poll was this?
3015000	3017000	That's my thoughts exactly. Why did this need to be asked?
3017000	3019000	Why does Microsoft care?
3019000	3021000	Are they trying to do naked fun games?
3021000	3023000	GameGrew asks, is Jess wearing underwear?
3023000	3025000	I vote for more naked fun games.
3025000	3026000	I'm all for naked Twister.
3026000	3028000	Naked is naked.
3028000	3030000	Naked is just naked.
3030000	3032000	It's just naked.
3032000	3035000	People are too bent up.
3035000	3039000	Actually, this is actually sort of one of the things we talked about in my massage school,
3039000	3041000	about working on people's gluteal muscles.
3041000	3044000	Don't be afraid. It's just a butt. You've got one too.
3044000	3047000	And if they fart, they fart.
3047000	3053000	I've had people fart on the table, Rob, and one of those people is in this room.
3053000	3055000	Nice. Alright.
3055000	3057000	I'm not naming names.
3057000	3062000	Let's go to, while the comedy is still going here on Orange Launch Radio,
3062000	3065000	let's go to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Launch Radio.
3065000	3069000	That's right, guys. It's time for the OLR Match Game.

3072000	3076000	So, folks in chat, if you want to play match game tonight,
3076000	3080000	say me once and only once.

3084000	3086000	Nothing else besides that.

3094000	3096000	If you've never heard the match game before,
3096000	3099000	it's just like the old school game show, which is coming back, by the way.
3099000	3101000	Which I heard the news recently.
3101000	3102000	Oh, that's hardcore. That's awesome.
3102000	3105000	It already did. It starts like in a few weeks on Comedy Central.

3115000	3119000	Hi, I'm DJ Ronda S. This is my first day of being sober.
3119000	3121000	Oh, sorry. This is not AA.

3141000	3143000	That's six opportunities to match tonight.
3143000	3146000	Huge celebrity panels. Everybody's got something they can write with
3146000	3148000	or think their answer is at least in their head.
3148000	3149000	Okay, good.
3149000	3150000	All right.
3150000	3151000	Rama, since you're our out-of-town visitor,
3151000	3154000	pick a number between one and 15.
3154000	3155000	Seven.
3155000	3160000	All right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
3160000	3163000	Rapid Slasher is going to be our chatter tonight.
3163000	3165000	If I didn't count that exactly, too bad.
3165000	3168000	So I'm going to say, are you there?
3168000	3170000	Make sure he can send me a private message.
3170000	3172000	Otherwise, he's cute.
3172000	3173000	All right.
3173000	3174000	So we have Rapid Slasher playing in chat tonight
3174000	3177000	if he responds to my message.
3177000	3178000	Let's get somebody on the Skype line.
3178000	3180000	He's got to play against somebody on the telephone.
3180000	3183000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3183000	3184000	Our username on Skype.
3184000	3185000	Orange Lounge Radio.
3185000	3187000	So now I have to type to Rapid Slasher.
3187000	3191000	Stand by to play.

3199000	3200000	And let's go to the phones.
3200000	3201000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3201000	3204000	Who's this?
3204000	3207000	Hello, who's this on Orange Lounge Radio?
3207000	3210000	GS68, but it says...
3210000	3211000	Are you there?
3211000	3212000	It's GS68.
3212000	3213000	Hi, GS68.
3213000	3215000	Can you hear us OK?
3215000	3216000	Yep.
3216000	3217000	All right.
3217000	3218000	Sounds good.
3218000	3219000	Well, GS68, welcome.
3219000	3220000	Are you ready to play the match game against Rapid Slasher?
3220000	3221000	Yep.
3221000	3222000	All right.
3222000	3223000	Are you going to kick his ass?
3223000	3225000	Well, I don't know how long he's been listening.
3225000	3226000	All right.
3226000	3227000	Well, here it is.
3227000	3228000	Do you know how to play GS68?
3228000	3229000	You know how the match game works?
3229000	3230000	Yep.
3230000	3231000	So I'm going to explain anyway.
3231000	3235000	We're going to read a sentence or a phrase, some type of topical sentence or phrase.
3235000	3237000	Somewhere in the phrase there will be a blank.
3237000	3238000	OK?
3238000	3244000	And it will be your job to match our celebrity panel here in studio with the best answer.
3244000	3245000	OK?
3245000	3250000	And you'll be playing against Rapid Slasher who will be submitting his answers in chat.
3250000	3251000	OK?
3251000	3252000	Sound good?
3252000	3253000	Yes.
3253000	3254000	You ready to play?
3254000	3255000	All right.
3255000	3256000	Three questions tonight.
3256000	3258000	Here is the first question.
3258000	3259000	Here it is.
3259000	3263000	This past Tuesday was Canada Day!
3263000	3265000	Happy Canada Day to all our Canadian Lizards!
3265000	3266000	This past Tuesday was Canada Day!
3266000	3272000	To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would play all his games in the nude for
3272000	3274000	that day.
3274000	3282000	The first game he played was blank.
3283000	3287000	To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would play all his games in the nude for
3287000	3288000	that day.
3288000	3290000	The first game he played was blank.
3290000	3292000	Celebrity panelists thinking about their answers.
3292000	3294000	Ding, ding, ding.
3294000	3296000	Dangia68 says, ding.
3296000	3298000	Did everybody ding?
3298000	3300000	All right.
3300000	3302000	Hold on. I'm thinking of my answer.
3302000	3304000	I have my answer actually.
3304000	3306000	Okay.
3306000	3308000	All right. So did everybody ding?
3308000	3310000	Here in studio? Anyone still thinking?
3310000	3312000	We're waiting on RapidSlasher. He's got to send me an answer.
3312000	3314000	Send me
3314000	3316000	an
3316000	3318000	answer. And if you want to help our players out,
3318000	3320000	you can always answer in the chatroom.
3320000	3322000	chat.orangewonchradio.com
3322000	3324000	So if RapidSlasher hasn't thought of anything,
3324000	3326000	you should take one of the
3326000	3328000	chatroom answers.
3328000	3330000	Let me turn down the music there. It was a little loud there. Sorry about that.
3330000	3332000	All right.
3332000	3334000	Still waiting on RapidSlasher.
3334000	3336000	If you can hear me,
3336000	3338000	sir, please hurry up.
3338000	3340000	Did he leave?
3340000	3342000	Is he still there? Oh, oh.
3342000	3344000	All right. There we go. We got an answer. All right.
3344000	3346000	Here we go.
3346000	3348000	GS68.
3348000	3350000	This past Tuesday was Canada
3350000	3352000	Day. To celebrate Canada Day, Rob
3352000	3354000	decided that he would play all his games in the
3354000	3356000	nude for that day. The first game he played
3356000	3358000	was?
3358000	3360000	The Guardian Legend. The Guardian Legend,
3360000	3362000	says GS68. The Guardian
3362000	3364000	Legend. All right. And RapidSlasher said
3364000	3366000	the first game he
3366000	3368000	played was Guitar Hero.
3368000	3370000	All right. So we have The Guardian
3370000	3372000	Legend, Guitar Hero. Let's see if we've matched anyone
3372000	3374000	on the panel. Rama S. What did
3374000	3376000	you say? Or is it just Rama now?
3376000	3378000	Just Rama. Oh, sorry. Rama
3378000	3380000	no S. The first game he
3380000	3382000	played was? I said
3382000	3384000	Rez. Rez.
3384000	3386000	Oh, Trans Vibrators?
3386000	3388000	Yes or no?
3388000	3390000	Oh, hell yes. Oh, hell yes. All right.
3390000	3392000	Can I get a hell yeah? All right. No comment.
3392000	3394000	There it is, Rez. DarkTetsuya,
3394000	3396000	the first game he played was? I also
3396000	3398000	said Rez. Rez!
3398000	3400000	Two people saying Rez in the studio. All right.
3400000	3402000	The first game he played was?
3402000	3404000	Imagine Babies.
3404000	3406000	That's just wrong.
3406000	3408000	That's very wrong. All right.
3408000	3410000	Loki. So 0-0 so far.
3410000	3412000	Sorry GS68. Let's see if we get a match on Loki.
3412000	3414000	Loki, the first game he played was? I said
3414000	3416000	MapleStory because, you know,
3416000	3418000	it's Canada Day, so
3418000	3420000	Maple.
3420000	3422000	Boo.
3424000	3426000	Where's that Price is Right losing noise?
3426000	3428000	All right.
3428000	3430000	No, just kidding, Loki. That was funny.
3430000	3432000	DarkSakura. You didn't say video game.
3432000	3434000	No, I didn't say video game.
3434000	3436000	I said Whack-A-Mole.
3436000	3438000	Whack-A-Mole.
3438000	3440000	Wow.
3440000	3442000	All hail DarkSakura.
3442000	3444000	Wow.
3444000	3446000	Uh-uh.
3446000	3448000	You haven't heard my answer yet.
3448000	3450000	All right.
3450000	3452000	So my answer this past
3452000	3454000	Tuesday was Canada Day. Did I say
3454000	3456000	Guitar Hero or Rez, or not Rez,
3456000	3458000	Guitar Hero or Guardian Legend? Let's see.
3458000	3460000	To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would
3460000	3462000	play all his games in the nude for that day.
3462000	3464000	The first game he played was
3464000	3466000	BeatMania.
3466000	3468000	That was my second choice.
3468000	3470000	Hello.
3470000	3472000	BeatMania.
3472000	3474000	2DX.
3474000	3476000	Right Side Pride, yo.
3476000	3478000	Oh, no, no, no, no.
3478000	3480000	That's not right.
3480000	3482000	That explains the firm handshake.
3482000	3484000	All right.
3484000	3486000	There you have it.
3486000	3488000	Welcome to the match game.
3488000	3490000	All right.
3490000	3492000	GS68, I'm sorry, it's still 0-0.
3492000	3494000	Are you ready to match
3494000	3496000	on this next one? Yes.
3496000	3498000	All right, GS68 says yes. Here we go.
3498000	3500000	Next question.
3500000	3502000	Loki recently
3502000	3504000	confessed to a big crime.
3504000	3506000	He
3506000	3508000	was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.
3508000	3510000	When
3510000	3512000	the police asked him to confess,
3512000	3514000	he confessed. Yes, I
3514000	3516000	did it. I hacked PlayStation.com
3516000	3518000	because the website
3518000	3520000	didn't have enough blank.
3520000	3522000	Fucking ding.
3524000	3526000	Loki hacked PlayStation.com
3526000	3528000	and said yes, I did it. I hacked
3528000	3530000	PlayStation.com because the website didn't
3530000	3532000	have enough blank. Ding.
3536000	3538000	We're done.
3538000	3540000	I'm still thinking.
3540000	3542000	Um, dang.
3542000	3544000	You should already have this since you wrote this question.
3544000	3546000	Yeah, that doesn't mean I have an answer.
3546000	3548000	Name this question
3548000	3550000	in the form of a walrus.
3552000	3554000	All right, I'm
3554000	3556000	going for that one. All right.
3556000	3558000	It sounds like everybody's dinged.
3558000	3560000	Oh, I didn't copy paste the question to RapidSlasher.
3560000	3562000	Shit, he's probably still thinking.
3564000	3566000	Bad host, no cookie.
3566000	3568000	Please
3568000	3570000	hurry.
3570000	3572000	Because I'm slow that time. All right.
3572000	3574000	Back with the music. Well, RapidSlasher,
3574000	3576000	thanks. Loki recently confessed to a big
3576000	3578000	crime. He was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.
3578000	3580000	When the police asked him
3580000	3582000	to confess, he confessed. Yes, I did it.
3582000	3584000	I hacked PlayStation.com because the website
3584000	3586000	didn't have enough. All right, we got
3586000	3588000	an answer from RapidSlasher. So,
3588000	3590000	GS68, the website didn't
3590000	3592000	have enough pylons.
3592000	3594000	Cylons.
3594000	3596000	Oh, pylons.
3596000	3598000	Sorry, I thought he was going for an old O-L-R in jokes.
3598000	3600000	Pylons. Didn't have enough pylons.
3600000	3602000	RapidSlasher said it didn't have
3602000	3604000	enough tits.
3604000	3606000	Old standby answer. All right,
3606000	3608000	there we go. So, pylons and tits.
3608000	3610000	Rama, the website did not
3610000	3612000	have enough prawn.
3612000	3614000	Prawn.
3614000	3616000	Not a match with tits. Not a match with tits.
3616000	3618000	Prawn is not tits.
3618000	3620000	Prawn is wannabe tits. All right.
3620000	3622000	Darktitsuya, the website didn't have enough
3622000	3624000	Iraqi suicide
3624000	3626000	babies. Iraqi suicide
3626000	3628000	babies, says Darktitsuya.
3628000	3630000	Drew, by the
3630000	3632000	way, for those that are new to the O-L-R,
3632000	3634000	Iraqi suicide babies, like that's a match game joke
3634000	3636000	dating back to like episode 30.
3636000	3638000	All right. Drew,
3638000	3640000	the website did not construct
3640000	3642000	additional pylons. Oh,
3642000	3644000	pylons. Wow, that's a match. I don't get the joke.
3644000	3646000	What's the joke? It's a Starcraft joke.
3646000	3648000	Oh, my God.
3648000	3650000	The guy that made the over 9,000
3650000	3652000	oh, my God. All right.
3652000	3654000	Well, shit, that's a match. Congratulations.
3654000	3656000	GS68 is on the board with a point. That's a
3656000	3658000	match for pylons. All right. Loki,
3658000	3660000	the website did not have enough
3660000	3662000	cleavage. Cleavage. Is that
3662000	3664000	a match with tits, judges? No, because
3664000	3666000	cleavage is the... It's
3666000	3668000	a match.
3668000	3670000	It's a match. I will say a half
3670000	3672000	point. A half point for rapid slasher.
3672000	3674000	A half point. A half point for
3674000	3676000	rapid slasher. Hey, S, I am the only person in this room
3676000	3678000	that possesses said substance.
3678000	3680000	All right.
3680000	3682000	There you go. DarkSakura, he
3682000	3684000	didn't have enough fuck?
3684000	3686000	PlayStation.com didn't have enough
3686000	3688000	fuck?
3688000	3690000	All right.
3690000	3692000	Needs
3692000	3694000	meat making fuck about
3694000	3696000	Resurka. All right, and my answer,
3696000	3698000	the website didn't have enough
3698000	3700000	Iraqi suicide babies.
3700000	3702000	I also went with the old stand by OLR joke.
3702000	3704000	All
3704000	3706000	right, could have gotten you two points, but there you have it.
3706000	3708000	All right. One more
3708000	3710000	question. A chance for rapid slasher to
3710000	3712000	take over the lead. Are you worried, GS68?
3712000	3714000	No.
3714000	3716000	I think
3716000	3718000	that was a no. It was very quiet. All right.
3718000	3720000	Here we go. Question number
3720000	3722000	three, and it's the last one, so
3722000	3724000	your last chance to make
3724000	3726000	a lot of points. Here we go.
3726000	3728000	The question is,
3728000	3730000	Jamie is very happy
3730000	3732000	to finally see an evil
3732000	3734000	woman robot appear in the new
3734000	3736000	Mega Man game. However,
3736000	3738000	she was very disappointed to hear about the name.
3738000	3740000	Splash Woman,
3740000	3742000	she exclaimed, screw that.
3742000	3744000	If I made an evil robot,
3744000	3746000	it would be Blank Woman.
3748000	3750000	Ding.
3750000	3752000	Jamie was very happy to see an evil woman
3752000	3754000	robot appear in the new Mega Man game,
3754000	3756000	but she doesn't like the name Splash Woman. She said,
3756000	3758000	if I had an evil robot, it
3758000	3760000	would be Blank Woman.
3760000	3762000	Ding.
3762000	3764000	Ding.
3764000	3766000	Ding.
3770000	3772000	All right.
3772000	3774000	I'm waiting for rapid slasher's
3774000	3776000	answer. Everybody in the studio good to go?
3776000	3778000	Everybody in the studio looks good.
3778000	3780000	We're just waiting on our
3780000	3782000	chatter.
3782000	3790000	Whistling.
3790000	3792000	Chatter, if you need help,
3792000	3794000	there's tons of answers in chat right now.
3794000	3796000	I like some of
3796000	3798000	these answers. By the way, some of the
3798000	3800000	answers we have for the previous one,
3800000	3802000	on the website,
3802000	3804000	website didn't have enough eye
3804000	3806000	of judgment, worthwhile
3806000	3808000	content,
3808000	3810000	porn, hentai,
3810000	3812000	super bacon, website
3812000	3814000	didn't have enough shots, that's a good one, that would have been a good one.
3814000	3816000	All right, and then the
3816000	3818000	other one, the first game I was going to play
3818000	3820000	naked, Captain Commando.
3820000	3822000	I like that one, says
3822000	3824000	Shauran. Boom Blox,
3824000	3826000	Texas Hold'em.
3826000	3828000	All right,
3828000	3830000	it looks like we have an answer from
3830000	3832000	Rapid Slasher, so GS68,
3832000	3834000	you have to answer first because you're on the phone.
3834000	3836000	If I made an evil robot,
3836000	3838000	her name would be...
3838000	3840000	Dick Woman.
3840000	3842000	Sorry, say that one more time?
3842000	3844000	Dick Woman.
3844000	3846000	Did I hear that right? Dick Woman.
3846000	3848000	All right.
3848000	3850000	All right, Dick Woman.
3850000	3852000	I think that might defeat the point of being a woman, but we'll see.
3852000	3854000	You never know. All our listeners have come up with
3854000	3856000	crazier things and matched.
3856000	3858000	Rapid Slasher says if I made an evil robot, it would be
3858000	3860000	Ferret Woman.
3860000	3862000	All right, getting a little warmer
3862000	3864000	I think. Let's see, Ferret Woman
3864000	3866000	and Dick Woman. Rama,
3866000	3868000	if I made an evil robot, says
3868000	3870000	Dark Soccer, the name would be...
3870000	3872000	I said Guinness Woman.
3872000	3874000	Guinness Woman.
3874000	3876000	Very well done. Very well done.
3876000	3878000	That's a good one. All right, Dark Tetsuya, her name would be...
3878000	3880000	A bit cliche, but
3880000	3882000	Bionic Woman. Bionic Woman.
3882000	3884000	Why not? Her name is Jamie Summers. Why not?
3884000	3886000	Good answer. Good answer. All right,
3886000	3888000	Drew, the name would be...
3888000	3890000	Ferret Woman. Ferret Woman. Oh my
3890000	3892000	gosh, a match. And with that,
3892000	3894000	Rapid Slasher takes the lead to
3894000	3896000	one and a half versus one. All right,
3896000	3898000	let's see. Loki,
3898000	3900000	the evil robot's name would be...
3900000	3902000	Bitch, get back in the kitchen and make me dinner.
3902000	3904000	Woman.
3904000	3906000	I don't think Dark
3906000	3908000	Sakura would actually say that. I think it might
3908000	3910000	be wrong, but I...
3910000	3912000	Whoa, we...
3912000	3914000	Uh oh, we just had Crash Bang Boom
3914000	3916000	live in the studio. That's all right.
3916000	3918000	Man down. I heard Broken
3918000	3920000	Glass. That can't be good.
3920000	3922000	Uh oh, what?
3922000	3924000	Oh, fun. That's all right.
3924000	3926000	Dark Sakura.
3926000	3928000	Wow, that's crazy. Did you hear that on Justin
3928000	3930000	TV? That's something else. Dark Sakura, her name
3930000	3932000	would be... Woman. She doesn't
3932000	3934000	need anything else.
3934000	3936000	That's all you need to know.
3936000	3938000	That would be pretty
3938000	3940000	evil.
3940000	3942000	All right, I got the finger.
3942000	3944000	All right, here it is in my answer. Here it is.
3944000	3946000	If I said Dick Woman, then GS68
3946000	3948000	wins. My answer,
3948000	3950000	if I made an evil robot,
3950000	3952000	her name would be... Sniper
3952000	3954000	Woman. Sniper Woman.
3954000	3956000	Which, unfortunately, is not a match, which means
3956000	3958000	Rapid Slasher wins
3958000	3960000	in a narrow victory of one and a half to
3960000	3962000	one. GS68,
3962000	3964000	I'm sorry you're the loser
3964000	3966000	tonight. So, uh,
3966000	3968000	is there any final words you have?
3968000	3970000	I am already...
3970000	3972000	Oh, sorry, you get hung up on because you lost.
3972000	3974000	All right. Hey, that's what the
3974000	3976000	losers get. I'm sorry. Poned.
3976000	3978000	Oh, come on. GS68's been on the show a
3978000	3980000	million times. Nothing, nothing there.
3980000	3982000	He knows the rules. Rapid Slasher,
3982000	3984000	if you have anything you want to plug,
3984000	3986000	send me a private message and I will
3986000	3988000	plug it. As the winner, you get to plug
3988000	3990000	whatever you want. Meanwhile, Loki's
3990000	3992000	going to get to the next story while I assess the
3992000	3994000	damage. Yes. Of the party
3994000	3996000	foul. Uh, there is another
3996000	3998000	rumor of a game coming out now
3998000	4000000	for, I believe, the PSP.
4000000	4002000	And, uh, this would make
4002000	4004000	sense, um, since,
4004000	4006000	well, they've had other
4006000	4008000	similar collections on the PSP
4008000	4010000	as well. It is the Star
4010000	4012000	Soldier collection. It's supposed to
4012000	4014000	contain, um,
4014000	4016000	four different Star Soldier games,
4016000	4018000	including Star Soldier,
4018000	4020000	um, let's see,
4020000	4022000	Final Soldier and
4022000	4024000	Soldier Blade. And
4024000	4026000	one other one, um, oh,
4026000	4028000	Super Star Soldier, I guess, as well.
4028000	4030000	So that's kind of
4030000	4032000	cool. Oh, I'm sorry. And, um,
4032000	4034000	I got this all wrong here.
4034000	4036000	Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier, Soldier Blade,
4036000	4038000	and Star Parodia.
4038000	4040000	Star Parodia?
4040000	4042000	And it would retail, I guess,
4042000	4044000	in Japan for, uh, 2940 yen,
4044000	4046000	which is less than, uh,
4046000	4048000	30 dollars US.
4048000	4050000	I do want this. Star Parodia is, like,
4050000	4052000	the best game ever. Haven't, like, done
4052000	4054000	Star Parodia on a classic
4054000	4056000	game? Uh, possibly.
4056000	4058000	I think you did one form of Parodius or another.
4058000	4060000	I don't know if it was that specific one. No, it's not Parodius. It has nothing to do with Parodius.
4060000	4062000	My bad. Star Parodia is a parody of
4062000	4064000	Star Soldier. That, I don't think you've done.
4064000	4066000	I'm all about Star Soldier myself, so
4066000	4068000	do want.
4068000	4070000	Alright. Sounds pretty awesome.
4070000	4072000	It's funny, though, because on the little screen shot that they have
4072000	4074000	or box shot or whatever it is, they have a bunch of
4074000	4076000	the Bomberman guys running around.
4076000	4078000	Alright.
4078000	4080000	I never saw RapidSlasher send, uh, something he
4080000	4082000	wanted to plug in private message, so, uh,
4082000	4084000	I guess, uh, that's that.
4084000	4086000	We'll see. Maybe after this story.
4086000	4088000	Uh, Burnout Paradise, this is
4088000	4090000	one of those games I played for a couple days and I was like,
4090000	4092000	eh, I'm over it, which is sad because
4092000	4094000	Burnout was, uh, such a fun series, but
4094000	4096000	you know, hats off to the
4096000	4098000	folks at Criterion because they keep trying to
4098000	4100000	invent new ways to make the game more fun.
4100000	4102000	Uh, granted they had a patch of theirs get pushed
4102000	4104000	back a little bit, but guess what's
4104000	4106000	coming for the next patch? This is very
4106000	4108000	interesting. Um, Criterion
4108000	4110000	is considering after this whole Cagney update
4110000	4112000	is done, they're gonna put planes
4112000	4114000	in Burnout Paradise.
4114000	4116000	Yes. Planes.
4116000	4118000	Like pilot wings. Planes.
4118000	4120000	I'd like, I'd like to see an airborne
4120000	4122000	takedown. That could be very
4122000	4124000	interesting, but I worry about
4124000	4126000	all the fan videos on YouTube we're gonna see.
4126000	4128000	I want free running to be in there.
4128000	4130000	I want people just running and then
4130000	4132000	running into other people and that,
4132000	4134000	that's what's gonna happen. They're gonna explode and
4134000	4136000	like crash. I will say though, referring
4136000	4138000	to an earlier story in the evening, um,
4138000	4140000	it would be pretty awesome to fly the
4140000	4142000	plane in Burnout Paradise, uh, with a
4142000	4144000	custom soundtrack playing Danger Zone.
4144000	4146000	It's getting ridiculous
4146000	4148000	now, seriously. Danger Zone.
4148000	4150000	Alright, maybe not. You know, Hamster. It's gonna
4150000	4152000	be Hamster and Hamster Bowl and it's, you know,
4152000	4154000	right across the street. Don't, don't
4154000	4156000	give them ideas. Please don't give them ideas.
4156000	4158000	Alright, we got one more story for
4158000	4160000	you and then the Skype line will be open
4160000	4162000	at 1877 Game OLR. Our username
4162000	4164000	on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but
4164000	4166000	having the last word tonight on the news,
4166000	4168000	DarkSakura. Hells yeah,
4168000	4170000	I am. Um,
4170000	4172000	one of the, uh,
4172000	4174000	I'd have to say best RPG series ever,
4174000	4176000	Let Me Untangle Myself.
4176000	4178000	It's not called Let Me Untangle Myself.
4178000	4180000	That would be a pretty fun RPG. Um,
4180000	4182000	it's a fantasy star
4182000	4184000	and they're doing a fantasy star portable.
4184000	4186000	There's a demo that is
4186000	4188000	actually, um, out, um,
4188000	4190000	uh,
4190000	4192000	let me see if I can find it. Yeah, on
4192000	4194000	the official website, I do believe, at
4194000	4196000	fantasystar.sega.jp
4196000	4198000	slash psp. Um,
4198000	4200000	that's got new characters and, uh,
4200000	4202000	some downloadable content and
4202000	4204000	the demo is going to be out on July 14th
4204000	4206000	and the game will be out on the 31st, but
4206000	4208000	that is Japan only.
4208000	4210000	Um, and it will be 301 megabytes
4210000	4212000	in size.
4212000	4214000	Sounds interesting. The demo, sorry.
4214000	4216000	Could be fun. It's supposed to be,
4216000	4218000	as I say, an extensive demo.
4218000	4220000	You can access story
4220000	4222000	mode and multi-mode.
4222000	4224000	Alright. And you can bring your, um, save data
4224000	4226000	from the demo to the final game.
4226000	4228000	Alright. I got the
4228000	4230000	plugs from Rapid Slasher before, uh,
4230000	4232000	we get to tonight's Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR
4232000	4234000	username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
4234000	4236000	Uh, Rapid Slasher would like to plug his YouTube
4236000	4238000	channel, available at YouTube.com
4238000	4240000	slash user slash Rapid Slasher.
4240000	4242000	And I'm looking at it right now. It looks like he has a two
4242000	4244000	girls, one cup reaction video.
4244000	4246000	Oh, those are always fun. It looks like,
4246000	4248000	looks like, uh, friend is watching it
4248000	4250000	on a cell phone there or something. So there you have it.
4250000	4252000	And a video called Chewbacca, which,
4252000	4254000	um, I can only imagine what that is.
4254000	4256000	Stop it.
4256000	4258000	Rapid Slasher would also like to say, Indiana
4258000	4260000	represent, and go see Radiohead
4260000	4262000	this summer.
4262000	4264000	Radiohead. Alright.
4264000	4266000	I didn't know Radiohead was going out on tour.
4266000	4268000	They have an album out.
4268000	4270000	They have a Rainbows album. Dark Sakura, we might have to
4270000	4272000	go do that. I love Radiohead. I'm thinking that.
4272000	4274000	Except Thom Yorke is nuts.
4274000	4276000	Alright. Look, before we get to the Skype line tonight,
4276000	4278000	we have a very special late-breaking
4278000	4280000	report, like live stuff going on right now.
4280000	4282000	Um, we're going to our OLR correspondent
4282000	4284000	who's on the line. Are you there?
4284000	4286000	Yeah. How's it going, guys?
4286000	4288000	Good. Who is this?
4288000	4290000	This is DJ Tyrant. Well, hello, DJ Tyrant.
4290000	4292000	Uh, folks around these parts might
4292000	4294000	remember you from STFU,
4294000	4296000	which once aired on the Orange Lounge back when it was
4296000	4298000	a network. Yeah, that was
4298000	4300000	a lot of fun. Which feels like so long ago
4300000	4302000	now. It's so sad. But DJ Tyrant
4302000	4304000	still does some freelance stuff for us and uses
4304000	4306000	our name to get into places. So, uh,
4306000	4308000	what did you use our name to get into
4308000	4310000	this week?
4310000	4312000	Uh, I went to Anime Expo, which actually just
4312000	4314000	ended today, and I just got
4314000	4316000	home about an hour ago.
4316000	4318000	And I got to play some games that aren't
4318000	4320000	out yet. Got to check out some stuff.
4320000	4322000	Okay, first question I've got to ask.
4322000	4324000	Anime Expo gets a little bit of a bad
4324000	4326000	rap out there in the community.
4326000	4328000	I've never been, so this is not a personal
4328000	4330000	enti- That's okay, it sucks. But all I've
4330000	4332000	ever heard is it sucks. Anime sucks.
4332000	4334000	Suckspo. Anime, you know.
4334000	4336000	Does it still suck, or do you
4336000	4338000	think people might need to pay at another visit?
4338000	4340000	I think people might
4340000	4342000	need to pay at another visit, because they've restructured
4342000	4344000	a lot of the upper people,
4344000	4346000	and it seems a lot more organized
4346000	4348000	now. Did it suck as bad
4348000	4350000	as last year, as DarkSira?
4350000	4352000	Oh no, it was- it was
4352000	4354000	much improved over the last year. I heard that that thing could suck
4354000	4356000	as badly as last year has ever sucked.
4356000	4358000	Last year was pretty bad.
4358000	4360000	In order to come up, you've got to hit rock bottom
4360000	4362000	first, so there you go. Rock bottom. There it is.
4362000	4364000	Yo, how many, uh, rabid
4364000	4366000	Odon Host Club fangirls did you have to
4366000	4368000	push your way through to get to the games?
4368000	4370000	Uh, too many.
4370000	4372000	Let's talk about games. What type of video
4372000	4374000	game stuff did you see at Anime Expo?
4374000	4376000	Uh, lots and lots of fighting games,
4376000	4378000	because that seems to be pretty much 90%
4378000	4380000	of any anime video game.
4380000	4382000	Fair enough.
4382000	4384000	Were there lots of fighting games based on
4384000	4386000	animes, like any particular ones that jump out in your mind?
4386000	4388000	Uh, yeah, well, the typical
4388000	4390000	Naruto games. Namco had their
4390000	4392000	PS3 Naruto game,
4392000	4394000	and that looked really good. The graphics were really
4394000	4396000	nice on that. Um, and D3
4396000	4398000	had their Wii
4398000	4400000	Naruto fighting game, and
4400000	4402000	so that's probably not going to be
4402000	4404000	that great, because
4404000	4406000	it's on the Wii, and Wii fighting games
4406000	4408000	generally are not that great. What was that, Logan?
4408000	4410000	I was going to say, which, by the way, if you want to play the demo for the
4410000	4412000	PS3 one, you can download the second episode of
4412000	4414000	Core, and they have an
4414000	4416000	exclusive demo in there. Huh. Are you
4416000	4418000	subscribed to Core? No, but I read it. Oh, sorry.
4418000	4420000	I ain't buying that. What the hell?
4420000	4422000	It's not stupid. Sorry, Jimmy. What else
4422000	4424000	was there? Uh, I went to
4424000	4426000	actually Arc System Works
4426000	4428000	panel, which does Guilty Gear,
4428000	4430000	and they showed off
4430000	4432000	a couple trailers for some games that are
4432000	4434000	coming out. Uh, Castle Sh-
4434000	4436000	Shikigami 3, which is a Wii
4436000	4438000	title, it's, uh, another
4438000	4440000	one of those shumps. Yeah, it's, uh,
4440000	4442000	really beautiful.
4442000	4444000	And it looks a lot like
4444000	4446000	Ikaruga.
4446000	4448000	That was, like, fun. Were there any non-fighting
4448000	4450000	games there? Or was that, like, all you saw?
4450000	4452000	Um, that was all that was
4452000	4454000	pretty much playable. I mean, so Calibur IV was
4454000	4456000	playable. It looked really,
4456000	4458000	really beautiful. Wow.
4458000	4460000	Street Fighter IV? Did you get some h-
4460000	4462000	Yeah, Street Fighter IV? Uh, Street Fighter-
4462000	4464000	Capcom was not there, so Street Fighter IV was
4464000	4466000	not there. Well, tell us more about Soul Calibur IV.
4466000	4468000	Did you get some hands-on play with Soul Calibur IV? How was it?
4468000	4470000	Uh, no, I didn't,
4470000	4472000	but it looked pretty much
4472000	4474000	like a standard Soul Calibur game. I mean,
4474000	4476000	there were only three playable characters, none
4476000	4478000	of the exclusives, no Darth Vader or Yoda
4478000	4480000	or, uh, Kratos, just kidding.
4480000	4482000	Haha, funny.
4482000	4484000	Yeah, um, another one
4484000	4486000	from Arc System's work was Battle Fantasia,
4486000	4488000	which I got to spend some time with.
4488000	4490000	It's, um, another
4490000	4492000	fighting game, but it's exclusive for the
4492000	4494000	360. It'll have, uh,
4494000	4496000	Xbox Live Play coming out, I think,
4496000	4498000	September 16th, they said.
4498000	4500000	There is a PS3 version. Very similar to
4500000	4502000	Third Strike in that there's, uh,
4502000	4504000	a parry system in it.
4504000	4506000	You hit the R1 shoulder
4506000	4508000	button, and the next attack is parried.
4508000	4510000	And if you do it and there's
4510000	4512000	no attack, you, there's kind of a
4512000	4514000	cooldown from when you can attack again.
4514000	4516000	Yeah, I know there is a PS3 version
4516000	4518000	of that, because I'm actually trying to get a friend
4518000	4520000	right now who's over in Japan to import it
4520000	4522000	for me, but, um, I'm surprised
4522000	4524000	they're not localizing that. Probably paid
4524000	4526000	exclusively. Uh, yeah, that came up a lot during
4526000	4528000	their panel. Everyone was like, are you bringing it over for
4528000	4530000	a PS3? And they haven't made any
4530000	4532000	announcements yet for that.
4532000	4534000	Um, they also
4534000	4536000	showed a trailer for that, uh,
4536000	4538000	what was it? The, the
4538000	4540000	Phoenix Wright style game that Jack
4540000	4542000	Hunter, and that was
4542000	4544000	kind of funny to see that, because it looks
4544000	4546000	almost exactly like, uh,
4546000	4548000	Phoenix Wright. Did you see, uh,
4548000	4550000	Blue Blaze Calamity Trigger?
4550000	4552000	Yeah, I saw the game, and
4552000	4554000	the line was just huge for it. And it
4554000	4556000	looks very similar to,
4556000	4558000	uh, the Guilty Gear XX series.
4558000	4560000	Um, has the same style of gameplay.
4560000	4562000	And,
4562000	4564000	um, there's a blocking system in it
4564000	4566000	that I, I got to check it out.
4566000	4568000	And on that top bar, if you
4568000	4570000	played Street Fighter Alpha 3,
4570000	4572000	there's a, there's a guard meter where you can
4572000	4574000	only guard so much. Um,
4574000	4576000	and it's separate in that game, but in this game,
4576000	4578000	both people share it, so I can see
4578000	4580000	some strategies playing out because of that.
4580000	4582000	I, I'm a little surprised that you didn't
4582000	4584000	see more, like, RPGs,
4584000	4586000	MMOs from little companies,
4586000	4588000	and all that kind of stuff at all. I, I saw
4588000	4590000	a ton of the little MMOs, I mean,
4590000	4592000	uh, MapleStory, um,
4592000	4594000	they got me to sign up for that. I'll
4594000	4596000	check it out. Sucker. Probably.
4596000	4598000	Yeah. Well, they gave me $10
4598000	4600000	in free, uh, um,
4600000	4602000	nickel and
4602000	4604000	dime-ing DLC or whatever it is.
4604000	4606000	Was it worth selling your soul?
4606000	4608000	I, I hadn't sold my soul yet.
4608000	4610000	Alright.
4610000	4612000	Yet. Keyword. Alright.
4612000	4614000	Uh, Jimmy, before we
4614000	4616000	let you go, we gotta know, thank you for giving us
4616000	4618000	the fill on what we miss on Anime Expo, but I gotta know,
4618000	4620000	best cosplay and
4620000	4622000	worst cosplay? Oh, yeah.
4622000	4624000	Oh, boy, uh,
4624000	4626000	my favorite cosplay
4626000	4628000	is probably a Captain Falcon that looks
4628000	4630000	pretty, pretty darn good.
4630000	4632000	I thought it was pretty funny. Nice.
4632000	4634000	Um, worst cosplay?
4634000	4636000	Um, any of the, the females
4636000	4638000	that really didn't need to be
4638000	4640000	in skimpy outfits?
4640000	4642000	Oh, god. There you have it.
4642000	4644000	I mean, you have that at every con, though, so,
4644000	4646000	I don't know. Alright.
4646000	4648000	It's just not appealing.
4648000	4650000	Alright. David Hader's awesome.
4650000	4652000	I assume that no cosplayers got
4652000	4654000	shot being in LA?
4654000	4656000	No. I don't know why everyone assumes that.
4656000	4658000	I'm shocked.
4658000	4660000	Alright, well, uh, DJ Tyrant,
4660000	4662000	I'll see you at BlizzCon. We're in a nicer area.
4662000	4664000	Yeah, definitely. It'll be a blast.
4664000	4666000	It will. Alright. Take care,
4666000	4668000	Jimmy. Thanks, guys. Take care.
4668000	4670000	Thanks for being on the show.
4670000	4672000	Alright, we like hearing from Jimmy, and I'm glad he has a place
4672000	4674000	to come on and talk, sadly, because STFU
4674000	4676000	is no more. It's sad.
4676000	4678000	But there is, uh, STFU is kind of combined
4678000	4680000	now. You know, you got half of STFU.
4680000	4682000	You got DMN, and you got Travis Donovan.
4682000	4684000	They do a show together here on
4684000	4686000	All Games Radio. It's Understation Live. It airs
4686000	4688000	Saturday nights, and it was the show I started on
4688000	4690000	years ago, and Dark Soccer was a guest
4690000	4692000	like 50 million times.
4692000	4694000	So, there you have it. Alright, if you want to give us a call,
4694000	4696000	1-877-GAME-OLR, and
4696000	4698000	it's already ringing. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
4698000	4700000	Hey, this is the
4700000	4702000	other New Yorker, SSJ100 Matt.
4702000	4704000	Well, hello, SSJ100 Matt, and you see
4704000	4706000	I switch shirts during the break.
4706000	4708000	I don't know if you're looking to just TV right now, but I've got
4708000	4710000	the I Heart NY shirt on right now,
4710000	4712000	just for you cats. There you go.
4712000	4714000	Yo, what's up, Matt? Yeah, if I got a Sharpie,
4714000	4716000	I can write IN BED underneath it.
4716000	4718000	Yeah, yeah.
4718000	4720000	The whole town. No, what's on your mind, SSJ100 Matt?
4720000	4722000	What was that?
4722000	4724000	What is on your mind tonight?
4724000	4726000	Nothing. I'm
4726000	4728000	pretty hyped up about, uh, the greatest game
4728000	4730000	ever made, uh,
4730000	4732000	um, well, according not
4732000	4734000	to you, and not according to you,
4734000	4736000	but, uh, Chrono Trigger.
4736000	4738000	Chrono, no, you're right, not according to me,
4738000	4740000	but I still think it's pretty darn good, and, uh,
4740000	4742000	you know, not even as good as some of the Final Fantasy
4742000	4744000	games I've played, but that's alright.
4744000	4746000	Even I will probably get the
4746000	4748000	Chrono Trigger remake on DS. There was this, like,
4748000	4750000	collective explosion of fan
4750000	4752000	gasm on the internet this week when that was announced.
4752000	4754000	That was pretty crazy. So, uh,
4754000	4756000	it's just like my Live Journal friends list exploded,
4756000	4758000	and I'm sure people's Twitters, uh,
4758000	4760000	blew themselves up as well. Um,
4760000	4762000	what would you, as a Chrono Trigger,
4762000	4764000	um, fan, uh,
4764000	4766000	really want to see in this, uh,
4766000	4768000	new DS version, Matt?
4768000	4770000	Well, I assume, you know, it's gonna
4770000	4772000	be based on, like, the SNES
4772000	4774000	version, but, um, I think, you know, just
4774000	4776000	keep everything the way it was,
4776000	4778000	and, uh, I think they said they were gonna
4778000	4780000	add more dungeons and online
4780000	4782000	play. That's fine with me.
4782000	4784000	So, I mean, I beat the game
4784000	4786000	10,000 times
4786000	4788000	since it's come out, so...
4788000	4790000	What would you have thought, Matt, if
4790000	4792000	it turned out that this game was a 3D remake
4792000	4794000	in the same vein as Final Fantasy 3 and
4794000	4796000	Final Fantasy 4? Would you have been a little scared, or what?
4798000	4800000	I probably would have been a little scared,
4800000	4802000	and I probably still would have bought it.
4802000	4804000	Still would have bought it, just to
4804000	4806000	support Chrono Trigger, but a little
4806000	4808000	bit apprehensively.
4808000	4810000	You know, maybe if we buy, if we each
4810000	4812000	buy 50 copies, they'll make, uh, Radical
4812000	4814000	Dreamers, or some sort of
4814000	4816000	dream on. Yeah, dream
4816000	4818000	on with that one. You never know. You never know.
4818000	4820000	Stranger things have happened, so there you have it.
4820000	4822000	Well, I, um, I
4822000	4824000	have my fingers crossed that Chrono Trigger
4824000	4826000	will do the fans justice. I have not
4826000	4828000	played the game in so long. I haven't played Chrono Trigger
4828000	4830000	since I was a kid, so it'll be fun to revisit
4830000	4832000	that series. You know what, it's good
4832000	4834000	because, you know, a lot of the younger
4834000	4836000	generation who, like, were born in the 90s,
4836000	4838000	they'll actually get a chance to play this, because, you know,
4838000	4840000	I'm sure there's plenty of people in the chat room
4840000	4842000	who've never played it before, so...
4842000	4844000	I am kinda curious, though, how the whole two-screen
4844000	4846000	thing's gonna work. I'm very curious
4846000	4848000	to see what they do with that, so, uh, we'll be waiting
4848000	4850000	for, uh, some more screenshots and stuff.
4850000	4852000	If they make it 3D, they better do it justice.
4852000	4854000	They're not. It's Sprite. It's old-school
4854000	4856000	Sprite. Alright.
4856000	4858000	Well, Matt, thank you so much for calling in. Any other last words
4858000	4860000	you wanna say real quick?
4860000	4862000	Well, yeah, two things. Um, when, when are you guys
4862000	4864000	coming out to New York again?
4864000	4866000	Tough to say.
4866000	4868000	I'm gonna aim for the spring,
4868000	4870000	because I do wanna see my friend that lives out there.
4870000	4872000	It's not gonna happen for digital life. I'll tell you that much
4872000	4874000	just because of Penny Arcade Expo and everything else.
4874000	4876000	But I'm gonna aim for spring.
4876000	4878000	That's cool.
4878000	4880000	So, we'll see.
4880000	4882000	What's the second thing?
4882000	4884000	Uh, this is for, uh, dark to see you.
4884000	4886000	Sir?
4886000	4888000	Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe.
4888000	4890000	What?
4890000	4892000	Wait a minute. When have I heard that before?
4892000	4894000	Sounds familiar. Alright.
4894000	4896000	Later, Matt. For that, you get hung up on it.
4896000	4898000	Alright.
4898000	4900000	1-877-GAME-OLR
4900000	4902000	username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
4902000	4904000	We've got room for about, how long are we running this?
4904000	4906000	Ooh, shit, we're almost to an hour and a half.
4906000	4908000	Maybe, like, one more call on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
4908000	4910000	1-877-GAME-OLR
4910000	4912000	username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
4912000	4914000	Sack anime a little closer to home
4914000	4916000	last week of August. Be there.
4916000	4918000	Oh, it's, it's Penny Arcade Expo.
4918000	4920000	Same weekend. Can't do it. Sorry, guys.
4920000	4922000	Sorry.
4922000	4924000	Fine. I'll go.
4924000	4926000	They do, like, five sack animes a year.
4926000	4928000	They do two.
4928000	4930000	There seems like there's a con at the Masonic Center every month.
4930000	4932000	They have two sack animes a month
4932000	4934000	and, sorry, two sack animes a year
4934000	4936000	and four sack animes a month.
4936000	4938000	I wish. And, uh,
4938000	4940000	four smaller sack comic cons
4940000	4942000	a year. Alright.
4942000	4944000	Thank you for the local news.
4944000	4946000	Do it. I love Sunrise Mall. That's awesome. Alright.
4946000	4948000	Here we go. Look. We'll stop, stop with the local chat.
4948000	4950000	Let's talk to somebody on the Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4950000	4952000	Who's this?
4952000	4954000	Oh, hi. Um.
4954000	4956000	I spaced out there for a sec. This is Golden Banjo.
4956000	4958000	That's alright. The heat is making us spacey, too,
4958000	4960000	but it's starting to cool off a little bit, thank God.
4960000	4962000	Actually, it's not as bad over here in New England
4962000	4964000	and New Hampshire, but
4964000	4966000	I feel bad for you guys.
4966000	4968000	That's alright. You guys have to deal with humidity.
4968000	4970000	At least we don't have that. Well, what's on your mind, buddy?
4970000	4972000	Um, well, actually,
4972000	4974000	I'm one of those Chrono Trigger people
4974000	4976000	and, uh, well, once again,
4976000	4978000	I know you might not be as crazy about it.
4978000	4980000	I don't actually even know
4980000	4982000	much about the game and I know
4982000	4984000	that I have to play it.
4984000	4986000	So, that just goes to show you.
4986000	4988000	How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
4988000	4990000	No, that's fine.
4990000	4992000	I'm about 16, so.
4992000	4994000	See, I think that's what it is. So, you were probably,
4994000	4996000	like, when these games first came out, God, if I was, like,
4996000	4998000	16 when those games came out, then you were, like,
4998000	5000000	one or two when those games first came out.
5000000	5002000	God, I'm old.
5002000	5004000	I think that's the whole thing that Matt was saying earlier,
5004000	5006000	is that this will really allow a whole new generation
5006000	5008000	to experience it, which is kind of cool.
5008000	5010000	So, it's kind of interesting. They're not changing
5010000	5012000	a whole lot and modernizing it, but I guess with the classic,
5012000	5014000	you don't have to. I mean, you don't modernize old movies.
5014000	5016000	Then again, sometimes Turner
5016000	5018000	colorizes them and all that stuff.
5018000	5020000	But, yeah, it'll be interesting.
5020000	5022000	And I don't hate Chrono Trigger by any means.
5022000	5024000	Just because I didn't name it my favorite game of all time
5024000	5026000	doesn't mean I hate it.
5026000	5028000	There's other games I like a little more,
5028000	5030000	but I also really like Chrono Trigger
5030000	5032000	quite a bit and I respect it as
5032000	5034000	a great RPG game.
5034000	5036000	So, no hatin' in this camp.
5036000	5038000	No hatin'.
5038000	5040000	And to the new generation, do it or I'll come over the
5040000	5042000	internet and kick your ass.
5042000	5044000	New generation, ugh.
5044000	5046000	So old.
5046000	5048000	Go Banjo, anything else you want to share with
5048000	5050000	our listeners tonight?
5050000	5052000	No, I just wanted to call in and say that real quick.
5052000	5054000	Alright.
5054000	5056000	Alright, that's pretty much it.
5056000	5058000	Have a good night, guys.
5058000	5060000	You too, have fun with Chrono Trigger DS whenever it comes out.
5060000	5062000	Probably will be the hardest.
5062000	5064000	Okay, I'm definitely looking forward to that.
5064000	5066000	Call back and let us know what you think, young whippersnapper.
5066000	5068000	Okay, you too.
5068000	5070000	Alright, get off my lawn.
5070000	5072000	He hung up. Okay, bye.
5072000	5074000	Alright, nice.
5074000	5076000	Very nice. Alright, we're gonna
5076000	5078000	go ahead and close up the Skyblind for tonight
5078000	5080000	so we can close out the rest of the show.
5080000	5082000	Big sorry and boo-hoo to those of you
5082000	5084000	who didn't get through, but please try again next week.
5084000	5086000	Quickly, before we close out tonight, some last
5086000	5088000	minute stories. Dark Soccer, you have anything
5088000	5090000	tonight? Sometimes you have some tidbits
5090000	5092000	for us? It's hot.
5092000	5094000	Yes, Hot Garage is very hot, but thankfully
5094000	5096000	it's cool. It's getting a little more bearable in here now.
5096000	5098000	Loki, any last minute stories
5098000	5100000	from you tonight?
5100000	5102000	I've
5102000	5104000	never really been looking at
5104000	5106000	stories, unfortunately, because I've been too busy
5106000	5108000	working on stuff.
5108000	5110000	Let's see here.
5110000	5112000	Trying to see if there was anything we missed.
5112000	5114000	Real quick.
5114000	5116000	I tried to hit on all the big stuff tonight. I don't think there was anything we missed.
5116000	5118000	Yeah. I hope not.
5118000	5120000	I'll be sad.
5120000	5122000	Oh, I know one thing that we didn't talk about.
5122000	5124000	They're actually...
5124000	5126000	I'm not sure if this is really headway, you'd really
5126000	5128000	call it, but someone's gotten
5128000	5130000	homebrewed run a little bit
5130000	5132000	on a PS3 using
5132000	5134000	Swap Magic.
5134000	5136000	And apparently they had
5136000	5138000	an elf loader on there that
5138000	5140000	they were able to run
5140000	5142000	a Genesis emulator.
5142000	5144000	So that's kind of
5144000	5146000	interesting. On what now?
5146000	5148000	It's a program called Swap Magic.
5148000	5150000	It was like one of those things to run
5150000	5152000	on PlayStation 3.
5152000	5154000	You know, run, I guess, burn games
5154000	5156000	and stuff like that, or region-free stuff
5156000	5158000	on the PlayStation 2, but they
5158000	5160000	ran it on the PlayStation 3
5160000	5162000	and were able to play a Genesis emulator on there.
5162000	5164000	I mean, sure, you could run Linux
5164000	5166000	or something like that on your
5166000	5168000	other operating system on that and
5168000	5170000	easily run games that way, but
5170000	5172000	that's not as fun.
5172000	5174000	So, that was one thing that was
5174000	5176000	kind of interesting.
5176000	5178000	Let's see.
5178000	5180000	Also, the
5180000	5182000	Wrath of the Lich King beta signups
5182000	5184000	are open.
5184000	5186000	Don't tell people because I want the key.
5186000	5188000	Well, actually, speaking of
5188000	5190000	things we missed, if you were
5190000	5192000	an UruLive fan,
5192000	5194000	a Missed Online fan,
5194000	5196000	on GameTap, they are pulling
5196000	5198000	that, the publishers are taking it back
5198000	5200000	and apparently going to revive the community.
5200000	5202000	Oh, good for them.
5202000	5204000	That's good. There was definitely a community
5204000	5206000	behind it.
5206000	5208000	There you have it.
5208000	5210000	We've got some other things here real quick.
5210000	5212000	Bomberman is coming to
5212000	5214000	the iPhone with Bomberman Touch,
5214000	5216000	which is interesting.
5216000	5218000	And
5218000	5220000	also,
5220000	5222000	I guess a game, the UK
5222000	5224000	retailer is going
5224000	5226000	to start publishing some independent games.
5226000	5228000	Which is
5228000	5230000	weird. That's interesting to have a retailer
5230000	5232000	doing that at the front like that.
5232000	5234000	Exclusives. Can you say exclusives?
5234000	5236000	And Sony, I guess, is putting out
5236000	5238000	another game that's going to be
5238000	5240000	coming out in
5240000	5242000	September, called Aqua.
5242000	5244000	And it's
5244000	5246000	a sequel to Aquanauts
5246000	5248000	Holiday, which is sort of
5248000	5250000	like Endless Ocean on the Wii.
5250000	5252000	So think of Africa, but under the sea.
5252000	5254000	And it looks
5254000	5256000	pretty cool, actually.
5256000	5258000	Also, there is a rumor that
5258000	5260000	Golf T it Up is
5260000	5262000	supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade
5262000	5264000	next week. Whatever the hell that's
5264000	5266000	supposed to be. But apparently it has its
5266000	5268000	Xbox.com page now, so
5268000	5270000	that's on there. As well as, I guess,
5270000	5272000	Pirates vs Ninja's
5272000	5274000	Dodgeball. About time.
5274000	5276000	And then there's also a Guitar Hero
5276000	5278000	homebrew game that's supposed to be coming out
5278000	5280000	towards the
5280000	5282000	end of August, August 20th.
5282000	5284000	It's called Video Game Hero.
5284000	5286000	Two of the tracks that they have on there,
5286000	5288000	Eye of the Tiger and Inspector Gadget.
5288000	5290000	It's the Inspector
5290000	5292000	Gadget theme, which both of them
5292000	5294000	sound kind of like
5294000	5296000	very midi
5296000	5298000	sounding. But
5298000	5300000	the game uses the touch screen
5300000	5302000	or the directional buttons. It's kind of
5302000	5304000	like Oda Jam, almost.
5304000	5306000	Which would be something else good to bring to the
5306000	5308000	DS. Very interesting.
5308000	5310000	Alright. Well, that's going to do it
5310000	5312000	for Last Minute Stories tonight, and we're about
5312000	5314000	ready to wrap up the show. So, guys,
5314000	5316000	thank you so much for coming to the show tonight and being here.
5316000	5318000	And we'll start off with the final thoughts.
5318000	5320000	Intern Drew, you have a final thought?
5320000	5322000	Can we wrap up the show in an air-conditioned
5322000	5324000	box? We can try.
5324000	5326000	Alright. Dartitsuya, any final thoughts?
5326000	5328000	One second.
5328000	5330000	Uh-oh.
5334000	5336000	What the hell is that?
5336000	5338000	Nice.
5338000	5340000	That little
5340000	5342000	keychain thing.
5342000	5344000	Rama,
5344000	5346000	your final thought?
5346000	5348000	It's a Cyberman. You were wrong.
5348000	5350000	It's a Cyberman.
5350000	5352000	Rama, your final thought?
5352000	5354000	Google Maps on my phone with
5354000	5356000	GPS has been making me uber geek
5356000	5358000	this entire weekend.
5358000	5360000	Geek. Nerd.
5360000	5362000	Damn proud of it.
5362000	5364000	My final thought is...
5364000	5366000	um...
5366000	5368000	hot. Dark Sakura.
5370000	5372000	Exterminate the heat.
5372000	5374000	Loki.
5374000	5376000	Hot chair is hot.
5376000	5378000	Alright.
5378000	5380000	That's going to do it for another episode of
5380000	5382000	Orange Laundry. Thanks so much for tuning in to us.
5382000	5384000	And remember, hey, we braved the heat.
5384000	5386000	We do this every week for
5386000	5388000	you guys, the listeners, for free.
5388000	5390000	We don't get anything from doing this, contrary to popular
5390000	5392000	belief. Nothing. We don't get paid by all games
5392000	5394000	or none of that. It's
5394000	5396000	all completely free for you guys. All we ask,
5396000	5398000	guys, if you enjoy our show, tell somebody.
5398000	5400000	Spread the word. Tell two friends about
5400000	5402000	the show. Post a nice review on iTunes.
5402000	5404000	Put something in your signature or something.
5404000	5406000	That's all we ask. And a lot of you have done that.
5406000	5408000	Thank you guys so much for that.
5408000	5410000	And thanks to that, independent
5410000	5412000	internet radio will continue to live on.
5412000	5414000	We suffer for your entertainment.
5414000	5416000	Do it.
5416000	5418000	For another 286 episodes,
5418000	5420000	we hope. Unless we pass out first.
5420000	5422000	So until next week,
5422000	5424000	pray for a
5424000	5426000	rainstorm or some windstorms,
5426000	5436000	and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
5456000	5458000	Right, anyway.
5458000	5486000	See you next week.
