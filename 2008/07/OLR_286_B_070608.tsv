509	5551	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5911	14753	To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15474	19095	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19915	22377	And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
22417	27761	We are live on this 4th of July weekend, except it's actually the 6th of July now, in 2008.
28181	29822	Did everybody have a good 4th of July weekend?
29842	30963	We have a lot of people in the studio tonight.
30983	32724	If you haven't listened to Part 8 yet, we have tons of guests.
32744	33825	Did you guys all have a good 4th of July?
34125	35867	Oh, we had a couple encounters, but yeah.
36007	36827	A couple encounters?
36867	37188	What's that mean?
37208	37868	Random encounters.
38088	38829	Random encounters?
38989	41531	It's like you are suddenly attacked by a gray slime?
41811	46074	Yeah, and just substitute unexpected fireworks.
46650	48591	Oh yes, good times.
49351	57513	Now, 4th of July, you're from New York City, Ranma, so the 4th of July in a cow town like this one is a little different from what you're used to in Brooklyn, right?
58053	59074	Not necessarily.
59214	59514	Really?
59834	61814	Even out in Brooklyn, it's very suburbanite.
62034	65415	Out in New York City, we look forward to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.
65976	66896	That's the big thing.
67516	70057	Do people go shoot their guns off in the middle of the street for 4th of July?
70237	73878	Actually, that's more up in the South Bronx where I used to live.
74478	75639	You're confusing that with Texas.
75919	76400	Oh, sorry.
76660	77220	I'm so sorry.
78041	81184	All right, well, we hope everybody had a safe Fourth of July.
81604	84546	Unless you're not an American citizen, then I hope you had a good Friday.
84686	94875	I would like to say in a very cryptic fashion that thank God the end of my headache is over, you know, and I can continue on with the work that I have been working on for a few weeks now.
94895	97717	If I'm not mistaken, Loki will be unveiling something big on next week's show.
97757	98117	Hopefully.
98157	98538	Hopefully.
98658	99799	Cross your fingers, cross your toes.
100865	109568	The funny thing about the 4th of July, though, really quickly, because I went to the extravaganza at DarkSakura's house that she had, stupid me thought, I want to bring something.
109608	111769	I want to contribute to DarkSakura's thing this year.
111829	112769	I don't want to be a leecher.
113089	114189	So I brought fireworks.
114529	117470	I went out and bought $40 worth of fireworks and brought it to the party.
117510	118311	I was like, okay, cool.
119151	123292	And only to be upstaged by all the more awesome illegal fireworks that were present.
123392	128014	Yeah, our neighbor put in money for the legal stuff.
128772	129332	For the fuck show?
155083	155463	Who knows?
155903	156464	In the garage.
157364	158184	That wouldn't be right.
158204	158565	Do it now.
158605	159305	Do it now.
160005	161086	Our void says now.
161186	162326	I don't think that's going to happen, sir.
162946	163847	All right.
164367	165628	It's a 6th of July party.
165708	166128	Yay.
166148	166708	All right.
166728	167849	Let's get back to some gaming news.
167889	168549	Loki, kick it off.
169656	171476	Yes, no fireworks right now.
171916	180438	But we talked a little bit earlier, actually Rob did during his release dates for Japan, that Persona 4 was going to be coming out soon.
180538	181218	Well, guess what?
181298	187019	Persona 4 is also making its way to North America as well, just not until December 9th.
187820	190540	And that should be pretty awesome.
190580	194141	And it was teased on, I think, a new trailer for Persona 4.
194621	198862	So December 9th is when you can get your Persona 4 on.
202822	209246	Oh, and it says also that each game will be bundled with the soundtrack CD as well with select music from the game.
210806	213068	And there are many RPG fans going squee!
213588	215029	Does it come with a free spirit gun?
216510	221272	I think it's cool, though, that they're still cranking them out for the PlayStation 2, quality games for the PlayStation 2.
221332	222413	It's not just a budget system.
222513	223593	They've still got good stuff.
223613	229757	Well, it's cheaper to develop for, and if they want to jump to the PS3, they'll still sell probably...
230949	232758	What they would sell on the PS3 with the PS2?
233285	234485	Gs68 calls them fuckworks.
261496	262677	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
283992	288917	and cooler looking, in their words, suave version of the PlayStation 2.
289197	290218	Here's the interesting thing.
290819	293561	It's going to be coming out in India first and then Europe.
293821	296584	It's going to be coming out on October 28th in India.
297344	297805	There you have it.
297885	298465	You know what that means?
298746	298906	What?
299106	303210	Ben Heck will be able to make an even cooler PS2 portable system.
304134	310218	The Economic Times, who reported this initially, also says there will be no more external AC adapter.
310258	315260	The price will still be the same, about $162 American, because this is in other countries.
315641	318902	What do you mean, no more AC adapter that's external?
319563	323785	I'm assuming that means the plug is built right into it, so you don't have to plug in an external adapter now.
323805	325446	It's built right into the system, I would imagine.
326203	326844	Power Supplies
351601	362752	Well, in other news, there is a list that was released by Hideo Kojima, who said what his top five favorite games are.
363293	370540	And he was actually speaking to a newspaper, Yomiuri Shinbun, and he listed Super Mario Bros.
370560	375545	series, Outer World, and Xevious as being some of the most memorable and influential games.
376005	379368	Portopia, Renzoku Satsu Jinjiken, Metal Gear Solid Super Mario Bros.
379388	379808	Alba World, Xevious
399315	400657	Hideo Kojima Talks, You Listen
414878	415058	Yes.
415278	416059	Alright, fair enough.
417559	419621	That I've bumped into him enough times that I think I should.
419901	422462	Awesome.
423603	426604	So, there's some interesting stuff coming out now.
426925	432688	PlayStation.com, I guess, was hacked according to a security firm's reports.
434409	442855	The IT security firm Sophos reported that someone has been messing around with the official PlayStation site, the US one.
443555	453442	And I guess some of the messing around fits in with fake ads on the SingStar and God of War pages.
454743	459947	And trying to, I guess, I don't know, put viruses or...
461624	464246	Spyware or something Were they trying to install spyware on people's computer?
464286	466907	Were they trying to say, haha, we pwned Sony, or what?
468008	488139	It says basically that the bogus pop-ups prompted people that saw them to purchase I guess what turned out to be bogus antivirus software Dope Oh my god, they put Gator on PlayStation.com Wow Apparently though, Sony's already fixed the problem, but you know
490249	491150	That still sucks.
492530	504776	I would say, if there was ever a list, and maybe we'll have to do this as a list list someday, even though it isn't directly video game related, but if there was ever a list of the most evil things to ever hit the internet, like the worst things to ever happen to the internet, Gator would be in the top three.
505516	507157	Banzai Buddy would be also in the top three.
507377	509838	Don't get me started on Banzai Buddy.
509898	510058	YouTube.
514100	514420	All right.
515121	518303	Anyhow, this is sad news in the Sony department.
518343	520864	You cannot have Kratos in Soul Calibur 4.
521445	526208	That news was announced one up, actually revealed in their most recent podcast because they've been playing the game.
526608	527328	Like you bastards.
527989	532912	They actually have the game there in studio because certain media people are more special than everybody else.
533532	534633	And so they've got it.
535113	539996	And they've been playing the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions and no Kratos to be found anywhere.
540396	542959	Unless it was some type of last-minute addition, but let's see.
543140	548326	If you think a big character like Kratos was going to be in a big game like this, do you think it's something that would be a last-minute addition?
548667	549508	Download content?
549888	550529	Possibly.
550729	552612	That could be, but I don't know.
553813	556697	I still say slim to none are your chances.
556857	557578	Cratos in Soul Calibur 4
578378	582702	DarkSakura, I know you and Hubby were debating which version of Soul Calibur 4 you were going to get.
582742	584204	Did you finally come to a consensus?
584944	584204	360.
585285	586146	And why is that?
586366	586746	Online.
587707	589749	Xbox Live is better.
590049	590389	Sorry.
590970	595434	Do you think if Kratos had been in the Sony one, do you think that might have tilted you in the other direction?
595654	596115	Not at all.
596435	596815	Not at all?
597296	597956	Not a Kratos fan?
598297	598437	No.
598737	600639	I don't really, honestly, I don't care.
601340	602582	Alright, fair enough.
603242	605305	Did anybody check out Soul Calibur on Xbox Live this week?
605325	607007	I didn't hear anyone mention it during their gaming weeks.
607327	608369	I only checked out the demo.
608389	613314	I didn't feel good enough reviewing it based on the demo alone, but it just seemed like the Dreamcast version.
614055	617479	No, but not that that's bad, because the Dreamcast one was pretty awesome.
617640	618120	But there you have it.
619882	621044	and DarkSakura.
637665	638305	Rip it open!
638465	638925	What do we got?
639186	646347	We've actually gotten a crap ton, so I'm very sorry for some of the emails that I am not answering.
646387	651689	I'm trying to get to ones that I haven't really read before, so... Yeah, let's hear from people.
651709	653149	No offense to the people who email us all the time.
653169	654770	Let's hear from people we don't often hear from.
655610	656270	Yeah, um...
661676	667481	Dear OLR team, my name is Zyman and I live in Sweden.
667882	670484	I'm a first-time writer to the show and I've listened for about three years.
670925	673347	I just want to tell you, you are the best and ask a question.
673747	680454	Unfortunately, I live in a time zone where I can't listen live, so I have to make do with the podcast, which, by the way, is the best podcast on the web.
681074	681174	Aw.
681354	683875	Anyway, why is Part 2 released so late in the week nowadays?
684355	688716	I don't get Part 2 until Friday night, and most of the other stuff you talk about by then feels kind of outdated.
689137	693098	Not that I don't enjoy what you talk about, but is there a reason why it can't be released on Tuesday or Wednesday instead?
694058	707162	Um, it's been kind of my fault recently, because I've just been so busy on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, specifically, because it's kind of in my... the ball's in my court to get that thing released, and with my birthday on the 4th of July, especially these past two weeks, it has just been a madhouse, so I apologize, that's not usually the plan.
707542	709963	The reason why we don't do it in, uh, well, first off...
710583	711263	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
726371	737898	24 to 48 hours out from part A, though, and that's just because that way a lot of RSS audio grabbers will skip a file if you haven't already grabbed it.
738038	745522	Like, let's say there's two new shows on the stream, it will only grab the most recent one, and so people miss out on half the show if they're not updating every day.
746522	751125	So we try to space it out about 24 to 48 hours to make sure people are getting each and every part.
751565	776061	and just so that you have something spread out throughout the week because most game shows release on Sunday, Monday but much fewer of them release on Wednesday, Thursday so that was kind of the whole point about that so that's why we did it that way so sorry it isn't a popular decision but you never know especially with our 300th episode coming up and talk of already changing some other things about the show you never know, it might be one big show in the future we'll see
777324	779106	We reserve the right to change things as we want.
779546	783109	I'm also not reading part of this email though because it is directed towards somebody else.
783910	786172	This is thank you for an excellent show and take care.
786192	787954	There you have it.
788474	789295	Okay.
790696	795400	This one's from Resimo who I don't think I've read an email from.
795420	796842	The name sounds familiar but it's been a while.
797560	798000	Hello, all.
798060	799861	I beat Metal Gear Solid 4 a couple weeks ago.
800361	802241	Everyone used the word epic to describe the game.
802281	804082	That's because there's no other word to describe it.
804662	806002	It's one of the best games I've ever played.
806162	806622	Seriously.
806722	810983	I'm sick of people bitching about games' cutscenes and not talking about how great the actual game is.
811583	814804	With so much diversity in the actual gameplay, I find this alarming.
815424	817785	I just want to know if any of you actually played it or just watched a bit.
817805	818945	I'm curious to know what you think.
819345	820786	Lastly, a couple of questions for Jamie.
820966	821186	Okay.
821806	824487	Did you watch any of the TV channels preceding the game?
825647	825847	Huh?
827631	828231	They're bizarre.
828251	832693	Okay, and did you see the one where David Hayter experiences the interview from hell?
833174	834414	And if you did, fangasm much?
834714	835495	I don't watch television.
836415	839857	I think, is it something like you leave the disc in and you see this random Easter egg stuff?
839897	840897	Oh, no, no, I didn't.
841357	841478	Oh.
842218	842478	Sorry.
843518	844419	But I can.
845419	849481	Yeah, no, I thought that the game was very diverse in the things that allowed it.
849741	854744	But it's also, I guess this is up on YouTube, but no, never mind.
855784	875722	PS, I sent you guys a video months ago with my goddaughter playing my great 1000 mile rally arcade machine since then I've purchased a Street Fighter 2 machine and I'm now eyeing a pinball table I played a lot of pinball in my youth but don't remember many of the machines one of my customers owns a pinball boutique and suggested either a Black Knight or Addams Family machine as the best ever
876960	879302	The Black Knight isn't too banged up, but it needs a bit of work.
879362	880223	Either one will cost me $2,000.
881745	886089	I've heard you rave about Black Knight pinball, but can't remember you talking about Addams Family one.
886449	887010	What says you?
887030	888471	Thanks for getting me through this week.
890473	892094	First of all, there's a Black Knight and a Black Knight 2000.
892675	894937	And if it's Black Knight 2000, it's worthy.
895277	896539	But I warn you, the game's a bitch.
897219	897700	It's hard.
898320	900983	Addams Family is really, really, really fun.
901508	902410	I love Adam's Family.
915956	929032	I'll have to find out the user group that my husband goes on and try to get you in touch with his group because Dan started off on a really banged up machine and worked his way up.
930214	931976	$2,000 for an Addams Family?
932336	932877	That's not bad.
933758	934739	at least as far as I've heard.
936119	937100	Just, you know, check.
937540	947325	You're going to have to go ahead and start, you know, investing in rubbers and plastics and, you know, get carnauba wax for the boards.
947425	948125	What do I use that for?
948545	949386	Oh, pinball.
949466	950646	For the actual boards themselves.
951647	956349	Make sure you've got Goo Gone handy and acid-free stuff because, Rob.
956709	959090	I'm sorry if I didn't know you were talking about pinball.
959110	960471	This would be hilarious.
960971	962112	I live in the gutter.
964622	969065	just email me later anyway
971491	974212	Next email, and this actually is somebody different.
974692	975912	Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.
976332	979053	While I was growing up, I had a lot of adventure and puzzle games to play.
979113	987414	Some of my favorites were the Monkey Island series, Loom, thank you, Loom is great, King's Quest, Before 3D, Toonstruck, The 7th Guest in the 11th Hour.
988074	993735	For the most part, those games were just point and clickers, but they all had great dialogue and good puzzles that fit into the gameplay.
994436	996376	I mean, Insult Swordfighting was the best.
997176	998277	My question is a two-parter.
998377	1003960	Aside from games like Professor Layton and Hotel Dusk, will we ever see a return of the good plain fun adventure game?
1004381	1009504	Part of the greatness of the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour was that they were of a much darker tone.
1009544	1010765	Did you ever play Phantasmagoria?
1011665	1013487	Yes, I did play Phantasmagoria.
1013507	1014047	It was awesome.
1014627	1021332	My second question is if we do ever see more adventure games, are they fated to be just childish games that will work for all ages?
1021872	1024093	Honestly, I would love to see another Phantasmagoria.
1024133	1024874	Wouldn't that be awesome?
1025356	1026237	Seven CDs that game was.
1026277	1027638	That game was epic.
1027858	1029239	I'd love to see another Monkey Island.
1030860	1041248	Only because the emailer isn't saying it, I would hope to, gosh, you already know about it, but Sam and Max, seriously, if you're not playing it, this game was made for someone like you who loves these old 90s puzzlers.
1041408	1046432	And just the cool thing, and I hate sounding like a salesman for this service, but I do like it.
1046492	1047073	I honestly do.
1047153	1050976	GameTap has all these old school PC games, a lot of the ones you're talking about on there.
1051196	1051436	Rob.
1051456	1051876	Which is cool.
1051957	1052157	What?
1052397	1053498	You fight like a dairy farmer.
1054599	1054919	Shut up.
1055569	1063972	Oh, Justin sent me an email that reminded me that the song I was trying to think of was Lab from 2DX8Style that had the hearty Hadouken.
1065453	1067233	Play some while I'm looking.
1067733	1068494	I'll have to dig it up.
1068874	1069314	8Style, Rob.
1069814	1070855	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1071315	1072035	It's going to take me a minute.
1072135	1073395	We got an email from Sauce.
1074356	1074656	Okay.
1075336	1078637	It says, Hi, Sois, which is my online nickname of the Saucers.
1079658	1081718	Sky, Otherguy, and DJ Ranma guest.
1082279	1083279	And Drew, if he's there, too.
1087517	1096663	Seeing how I know DarkSakura thoroughly enjoyed reading my lengthy multi-paragraph review of the Iron Man video game released by Sony, I thought it only be fair to review another game, Lego Indiana Jones.
1097563	1105888	But as to be kind to her vocal cords rather than writing the review up here in this email, I've written it up in my own blog and provided a link to paste in the chat room, which I will in just a moment.
1107169	1113053	The journal, though, is marronmarvel.livejournal.com It's M-A-R-R-O-N-Marvel
1113755	1119643	And she will soon be writing for Orange Lounge Radio when we get our new website done, which is the next big task here at Camp OLR.
1120063	1122586	This is part of a project I'm working on for the OLR website.
1122626	1123928	Dubiously and aptly named project.
1124008	1126251	Update the website so more content can be added.
1126451	1126792	My bad.
1127573	1132178	But for now, the review sits on my own blog until Skye and I can get together and work something out.
1132739	1135140	DarkSakura has another dozen or so emails to read.
1135160	1136000	Keep up the great work, OLR.
1136020	1137341	Sincerely, your friendly neighborhood sauce.
1160882	1161823	Friendly Neighborhood Sauce.
1161903	1162343	I like that.
1162764	1163785	Very nice.
1163865	1165126	I love that she's dedicated.
1165186	1168408	I need someone like that to keep poking me going website, website, website.
1168689	1171050	But I'm really glad there's enthusiastic people.
1171131	1172332	No, I don't like sharp things.
1172412	1173633	No, me no likey.
1175294	1177436	Well, if you keep poking me, then I'm not going to give you...
1185256	1187778	Hey guys and gals, I've been listening to this show for almost four years.
1187858	1196303	It is also the first podcast I have ever listened to, but I have never been able to listen live because of school, family, etc.
1209813	1210673	Abandon them all!
1211014	1211414	Just kidding.
1231918	1236721	Love this show and keep up the good work from Taco4Brain, which is my gamer tag, by the way.
1237221	1237601	P.S.
1238081	1241043	Imagine Babies would have been a lot better with Harpoons, Fire, and Dragon Force.
1243271	1246132	This is going to sound so horrible, but I don't know any other way to put it.
1246553	1250234	The sad thing is my list, I don't have a problem giving my gamer tag out because it's on the forums.
1250294	1253055	It's green sky, but it's S-K-I-E, all one word.
1253315	1255936	But here's the problem is that my friends list is completely full.
1256476	1261999	And Microsoft does not address the issue about letting us expand our friends list yet.
1263419	1266160	And I try to when new OLR listeners want to be added.
1266560	1270722	I go in my list and I look for people who haven't signed on in like a week and I'll delete them.
1271062	1297165	but the problem is I'm trying to balance I don't want to delete anybody I know offline but I also don't want to make any OLR listeners sad so I'm having to play this really delicate balancing game with the friend list so you can send me a friend request I guess I could delete someone who hasn't signed on in a week but it's tough please don't be hurt if I defriend you or refuse your friend request I'm just full and I'm not even on Xbox that often I'm still waiting on my request
1297765	1299166	Did you... Didn't I accept it?
1299766	1301427	It bounced back saying it was full.
1301887	1307811	Oh, you gotta like call me or text me and say I'm gonna try to add you and then I'll dump somebody who hasn't signed on in a week and then add you.
1307851	1308731	How about after the show maybe?
1308751	1309352	Alright, we'll do that.
1309472	1309632	Cool.
1309652	1310372	We'll do it after the show.
1310973	1311433	I'm sorry.
1311453	1312834	It's okay.
1312854	1315956	On the same subject, my WeConnect24 is now working.
1316276	1316536	Nice.
1316556	1321599	So if you wanna add me... And it's all on the forum because you don't know your friend code I would imagine.
1321619	1321659	No.
1322432	1322672	PC Games
1347461	1349943	See, FearTheClaw in chat says, Aw, how sad.
1350023	1351244	Sky has too many friends.
1351324	1353285	Cry face.
1353385	1355827	I feel like I sound like a stuck-up ass when I say that.
1356127	1356407	Rob.
1356587	1356827	What?
1357368	1358408	You are a whore, darling.
1359889	1360690	I'm sorry.
1360790	1363111	I just, you know, I... Okay.
1363632	1364192	Emails, please.
1364532	1365233	It is what it is.
1365393	1365793	Alright, what?
1367735	1370837	I'm going to quickly go through some of these and paraphrase them.
1371137	1375340	GS68, who introduces himself in English, Spanish, and Japanese.
1378212	1392621	I wanted to know what happened to the guy who said that geeks and otaku were the only ones who wanted more storage space and said that it's sad that a representative of Nintendo would have to hold to a level of professionalism and didn't.
1393361	1396923	Well, you haven't heard from him lately, so that's hopefully a good sign.
1397023	1397864	Thumbs up, Nintendo.
1400145	1404768	And wants us to come to Final Mate 2009, which will be a likely.
1404808	1406309	Most likely, yeah.
1406389	1407971	Outlook good on the Magic 8-Ball.
1408531	1413555	And says, this email was brought to you by Sizzler, home of the Endless Salads.
1414676	1417178	By the way, California Extremes in two weeks, DarkSakura.
1417218	1417758	I'm going!
1417918	1418839	Do we want to trek out there?
1419219	1419659	I'm going!
1420220	1421261	You have room in your car for one more?
1421661	1421841	Sure.
1421861	1422401	Alright.
1423162	1424343	You're only going for the one day, right?
1424363	1425344	You're not going to stay overnight or anything?
1425384	1427065	Well, I don't think we're going to stay overnight, but we might go back.
1428143	1429425	Okay, I might just go for one day.
1429845	1430786	I think we're going to do the Saturday.
1431087	1433029	Honestly, I think I'd only be able to stay in the one day.
1433149	1434491	Yeah, I think we'll both go on Saturday.
1434891	1436673	I'll come with if you don't mind extra room.
1436994	1437374	Go for it.
1437614	1438075	Alright!
1438215	1438836	OLR car trip!
1441061	1442923	Anyway, short email from Saltech.
1442963	1453132	Hey, OLR, I was learning if anyone, including chat, knows anything about whether Diablo 3 will be pay-to-play like World of Warcraft or buy the game like Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 anyway, love the show.
1453192	1455293	I'm glad to hear you like the email address.
1455794	1461379	It's actually supposed to be 666% pure evil, but you can't use the percent character in email addresses.
1461719	1463561	So it ended up with being what it is now.
1463681	1464461	Keep up the great work.
1464982	1465883	Also, periods help.
1466852	1472735	So far as I know, and this comes as a Blizzard fan, it's going to be pay once and play.
1472775	1474095	Just standard Battle.net model.
1474556	1474916	Why not?
1474956	1476336	Diablo 2 is the same way.
1476456	1479678	I mean, if Blizzard were to change it now, they'd just be getting greedy.
1480918	1481419	Bastards.
1481579	1483039	But I don't think that's going to be the case.
1485236	1488077	Thank you for watching!
1508483	1511384	So I made my parents take me there with a friend and we were all like, where is it?
1511945	1514906	But just when we were about to give up, my mom was all like, hey, is that it?
1514946	1516386	And I'm like, yes, it is!
1517307	1523289	So we take a look inside and my parents are all confused because they aren't otaku and it was awesome.
1523470	1528972	It was called Planet Zero and I was so happy I almost cried because they had imported games such as Poppin' Music!
1529432	1529832	Yay.
1530493	1534796	The only thing that really, really sucked was the arcade was small, but that's okay.
1535176	1535877	It's still cool.
1536177	1537498	Well, thank you for taking the time to read this.
1537538	1538219	Sorry it's long.
1538459	1538919	Lol.
1539139	1539920	Your friend, Isabel.
1543302	1544203	But it's signed as Ro.
1546425	1546985	Last email.
1547826	1548566	It is a long one.
1549307	1549627	All right.
1549807	1550388	Long email is long.
1550408	1555171	But this one is special because of their ISP, which I think is funny.
1556452	1557053	I'm not going to say.
1557433	1557873	Oh, we can't say?
1557913	1558073	Oh, okay.
1560174	1567199	Well, actually, it's... I'm pretty sure that the name is pronounced Nige just as a nickname.
1568059	1568319	Alright.
1569140	1574723	I always think about this one song that has the name of this supermarket chain in the title.
1576004	1576244	Anyway.
1578145	1578465	Alright.
1579486	1579966	Read the email.
1580386	1580827	Fine!
1582347	1583108	Dear OLR...
1584608	1592235	I finally had my first sustained encounter with a PSP last week after years of getting my gaming fix on a Nintendo system, and I was very surprised at how much I liked it.
1592695	1605306	The public perception of Sony's computer entertainment strategy at the moment generally seems to be one of a company suffering a midterm malaise, much like Nintendo went through after the year of the 16-bit era until the Wii slash DS combo.
1606467	1625602	as you always rightly say it's all about the games and although there were a handful of interesting titles in the PSP it never really grabbed my attention until Crisis Core arrived in Europe as my girlfriend has a PSP I decided to buy the game and give it a go the game itself is very good I have to disagree with Loki's comments a couple episodes back I find it very entertaining
1625962	1631163	Part of the reason for this, personally, I feel, is because I've been out of the Final Fantasy universe for so long.
1631543	1643325	I played Final Fantasy Tactics on GBA, the Credit Crystal Chronicles spin-offs, and the boring Revenant Wings game on the DS, along with some of the mundane remakes, but not any of the console games since Final Fantasy IX.
1643945	1650986	I really like the art style and the more fluid battle mechanics that appears to have replaced the original turn-based system.
1651146	1654327	I also think that the mission structure fits the portability of the PSP.
1655007	1662553	I can pick up the game, play a mission for five minutes whilst in a shop or sitting on the toilet and then can put it down again.
1664094	1666736	I told you I keep a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the bathroom.
1667737	1673942	When I'm ready to spend time with the story, then I can get bogged down in wasting an hour or two, but when I'm ready.
1675403	1676744	Anyway, that's not my main point.
1676924	1680347	Accessing the PSP has been like opening a shiny door in my head.
1680907	1681388	That's nice.
1682468	1683689	What a wonderful product.
1683789	1687350	With all that functionality, it really is a media center in your pocket.
1687851	1709160	I guess it could be argued that Sony's insistence on turning their game machines into home computers may have been something of a flaw in their strategy, but then this is also the first week that I have been listening to the OLR podcast out in the sunshine on a PSP before catching up on other RSS feeds that I regularly check out on my desktop PC, which I couldn't do on my DS.
1709540	1711481	And thank you for making us your first priority this week.
1712981	1716262	There are pros and cons to any product in a competitive marketplace.
1716962	1722623	The opportunity cost of the next best alternative will always be subjective.
1723083	1741167	However, with Nintendo's seemingly lackluster provision of mature, and by that design I don't necessarily mean M-rated, just intelligent grown-up design versus the likes of Imagine Babies titles, and the lack of desire to provide choice, goodbye freeloader and region-free gaming, the historic...
1741727	1766765	the historic poor strategic vision in PAL territories and of course the fact that we are seen to be geeks and otaku I'm starting to feel marginalized by Nintendo who I once championed so much it seems ironic that in the moment of their greatest commercial success I find myself completely disinterested by what they have to offer it may have something to do with my age I'm not going to say
1767266	1772322	and my gaming habits but I am or rather have been a loyal customer and I do agree with you and I'm not much older than you.
1774182	1791137	My girlfriend, the PSP owner, who fits the historic profile of a traditional European gamer, having been raised on PC and home computer gaming scene in the late 80s and early 90s, rather than foreign consoles, asked Kropotkin for more info, summed it up neatly for me recently.
1791237	1794000	You were once their target market, but not anymore.
1794640	1797103	I guess it really is that simple.
1798638	1808161	What the Nintendo marketing executive said with their vision really is, and I'm fine with that, they're opening up gaming to a broader audience and making it socially acceptable lifestyle activity.
1808581	1815023	You just have to look at all those unrealistically happy generations of families in their TV commercials to get a sense of that.
1815423	1824906	Who would have thought Granny would ever get so enthused by virtual puppies and Sudoku puzzles whilst bonding with their grandchildren on an expensive nuclear family vacation to an unspecified exotic location?
1825806	1827647	So why am I bothering to say anything at all?
1828107	1843414	I just want Nintendo to know that thanks largely to the production of the must-want titles by their competitors and tepid treatment of their customer base, a personal tipping point has finally been reached.
1843795	1846516	I'm in the market for a PSP Slim and a PS3 now.
1846836	1850798	My Wii is gathering dust, my DS gets the occasional play, and I think I'm not alone.
1852737	1854278	Very interesting quote in there.
1854318	1857961	Something about, you were the target audience, but not anymore.
1858242	1862205	It kind of hurts to hear, but I think your girlfriend's on to something with that.
1862285	1863946	Or no, was that his quote, or the girlfriend?
1863966	1864447	I don't remember.
1864507	1866588	But whoever said that is definitely on to something.
1867089	1868130	So, kind of sad.
1869551	1875335	I think something the hardcore gaming fans forget once in a while, like, OMG, Nintendo, how could you screw us over like this?
1876576	1880600	Well, it was so much better when it was 8-bit.
1880640	1881881	Well, it's not 8-bit anymore.
1882765	1884286	And we're not 13 anymore, you know?
1884686	1886106	Kind of something to think about.
1886126	1886967	That was the last one I'm reading.
1887587	1890048	And I'm sorry for everybody else that I skipped over.
1890688	1893409	You know, I had a shit ton of emails.
1893429	1893790	That's right.
1893810	1894850	But there's always next week.
1894930	1900332	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Yeah, I'm leaving the ones I haven't read as unread.
1900632	1903494	And maybe we'll post some on the forums and respond to them there.
1903514	1903894	You never know.
1904960	1905241	We'll see.
1905741	1910050	All right, mailbag at orange.com if you'd like to contribute to DarkSakura's massive emails.
1910270	1910570	There you go.
1910591	1912654	All right, back to some gaming news, eh, Loki?
1913356	1915157	XBOX 360 Pro Model
1943716	1958210	A rumor, wink wink nudge nudge, and who knows if it's true, but yeah, I guess we'll just have to wait until E3 to see if it's true.
1959471	1963374	But boy, wouldn't E3 be a really good time to announce something like this?
1964175	1967979	Yeah, that would be a very good time to announce something like this.
1968959	1969299	E3, Quandary
1996553	1999276	Yes, that's really sad.
2000657	2001257	Really sad.
2001598	2004120	But we're sure that that wouldn't happen, right?
2004160	2005201	That would never happen.
2005922	2006803	Not at all.
2008544	2012348	But you know, hey, these Microsoft rumors, they're never true.
2014344	2014684	HALO HALO
2039711	2040572	Here's the thing, though.
2040652	2045975	It could be Peter Jackson's game, but the interesting thing about it, it will not have the Master Chief in it.
2046936	2050258	So could the Halo franchise survive without Master Chief?
2051238	2051519	I don't know.
2051819	2059344	I forgot to mention, too, as part of that story, the 20 gig model is rumored to be phased out with this price drop.
2059384	2066968	You may remember last year, I believe, when the 80 gig came out, they dropped the price of the 60 gig also for the PS3.
2067108	2067889	Same type of thing.
2068393	2070694	But we would have no idea if that is actually happening.
2070714	2075615	Yes, we would have absolutely no idea that something like that would actually be happening.
2077755	2080756	A question for our guests in the studio since we haven't heard from you in a little bit.
2080816	2083857	Could Halo work without Master Chief?
2085077	2086517	Ask someone who fucking cares.
2086537	2090618	Well, they have Halo Wars and I'm pretty sure Master Chief's not in that.
2091178	2091619	Why not?
2091959	2093359	Tell a game about Cortana.
2095250	2096451	A game centered around Cortana?
2096491	2097652	Okay, maybe.
2098132	2098673	Getting warmer.
2098913	2100014	Ranma, any thoughts?
2101335	2103716	I could give two shits about Halo, really.
2103736	2104677	You know what would be awesome?
2104977	2105998	Red vs. Blue, the game.
2106658	2107199	That'll work.
2107539	2108900	Yes, yes, yes.
2110441	2110961	Rabble, rabble.
2111021	2111742	I would play Sister.
2112142	2117566	They could do a Halo game without Master Chief, but that's like a Halloween movie without Jamie Lee Curtis.
2118407	2119788	It's just destined to not be as good.
2119968	2120328	Come on.
2121269	2121529	Come on.
2122996	2124497	That broke me.
2124537	2125198	That broke you?
2125718	2125958	Yes.
2126778	2127519	Syntax error.
2127619	2130261	I think it would be with the Arbiter.
2131481	2132002	Who knows?
2132842	2133403	E3, we'll find out.
2134103	2139286	I can't believe that Halo would be a franchise Microsoft would just like, go away into the sunset.
2139707	2141147	It'll be back one way or another.
2141247	2141608	We'll see.
2142389	2144390	Well, this makes me plenty happy.
2146212	2153337	A new zombie smacking minigame game is coming out called The House of the Dead EX.
2154618	2162183	It's zombie love, zombie rock, zombie bowling, zombie whacking, zombie shooting.
2162323	2163083	Zombie whacking?
2163404	2164825	Yep, some zombie love.
2166024	2190619	but it's actually I do believe it has a lot to use the guns or this sort of pedal that's on it like in Time Crisis but it's an arcade machine and it's also a really cutesy kind of bizarro cel-shaded anime style it's the cel-shaded sort of like how House of the Dead 3 was but it's just cute
2192356	2193760	House of the Dead 3 House of the Dead EX
2202184	2205607	I don't think zombies and cute should ever be in the same sentence.
2205727	2207348	Unless you have a not in there.
2207508	2210511	I don't know.
2210871	2214914	And then will Uwe Boll be basing a new movie based on that too?
2214994	2215174	No.
2215255	2217076	I'm thinking no.
2217176	2219058	I think Uwe Boll will be a zombie in the game.
2219178	2219758	Don't go there.
2219938	2221500	For the love of God, don't go there.
2221860	2222701	I think he should be a boss.
2225003	2227505	Zombies got talent, says Vandalist in chat.
2227885	2229887	Now they're just doing all these zombie things in chat.
2230987	2232589	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2249452	2256859	is that each episode will be free or be a free download and remain a free download for a 24 hour period.
2257520	2265648	After that, each episode will go into GameTap's archives and be available to download individual for a yet to be determined price.
2266108	2267590	Where the fuck is Alice, by the way?
2269212	2270513	We need an American League game.
2270533	2271093	We need Alice.
2271993	2273154	Is that not on GameTap yet?
2273274	2275074	I have not seen Alice on GameTap.
2275395	2276455	It's probably coming.
2276515	2280056	You can bet that if this game... They're probably waiting until like a month before or something.
2280657	2280997	We'll see.
2282037	2293522	So these will all... I guess the first one is going to debut on July 31st and it's going to be called A Boy Learns What Fear Is.
2294122	2294482	Oh my.
2295243	2295943	Sounds a little scary.
2297816	2302022	Well, changing gears here and moving on to something completely different.
2306788	2309832	You know when this music plays, the news is not going to be good, folks.
2312708	2317849	You heard that when the Sony PlayStation 3 launched, you heard all sorts of crazy shit happen.
2317889	2319950	People were getting shot up in line.
2320270	2324811	People were getting the Sony PlayStation 3 stolen from them right out of their hands.
2325191	2329152	But now, kids, we have reached the lowest of the low.
2329572	2331432	And it didn't even happen in the US.
2332053	2333353	It happened in Australia.
2334949	2338451	I thought everyone got along in Australia, but no, this is how horrible it is.
2338891	2349978	Zach Tuili, I apologize if I mispronounce that, but Zach Tuili, unfortunately, he has a form of muscular dystrophy, and he is confined in a wheelchair for most of his life.
2350558	2353560	He was able to get something from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
2353940	2358863	And Zack opted to get a PlayStation 3 from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which, by the way, is a great charity.
2359003	2360084	I've helped raise money for them before.
2360104	2361164	They were a wonderful, wonderful charity.
2361565	2361945	Here's the thing.
2361985	2371231	The charity got him the PlayStation 3, got him the games, and this week thieves broke into his home and stole everything.
2371331	2374292	Jewelry, appliances, PlayStation 3, and all the games.
2375093	2375513	Fuckers.
2377154	2378475	Maybe his wish was to be mugged.
2378979	2379739	I don't think so.
2380000	2385462	I think this is one of those things where I would say this country's going to hell, but unfortunately it didn't happen here.
2386103	2387143	This world's going to hell.
2387343	2388484	Congratulations, everybody.
2388624	2390285	But then again, it's Australia.
2390485	2391806	We didn't see that coming.
2391946	2392846	No, no, no.
2392866	2396928	There's a lot of nice people living in the land of upside-downness.
2396948	2398309	Yeah, you don't want to go there.
2398769	2400710	I think you don't go there, girlfriend.
2400810	2401131	All right.
2402571	2409756	So, obviously, that's about 99 different ways of fucked up, and we will count them out for you right now.
2411617	2413038	Or at least give you our FUs of the week.
2415719	2417600	Oh, this is bad.
2417721	2419061	Here is justice.
2419121	2421483	Here is punishment.
2421643	2424405	Here is... This is fucked up.
2424425	2427026	DarkSakura.
2427046	2427667	FU to the 580s.
2430896	2434324	and, um, FU to the asshole.
2434745	2435868	No, FU to getting pulled over.
2437773	2438174	Snapped.
2438388	2442390	I got pulled over at the Sacramento airport.
2443590	2452294	First of all, I was dead tired, exhausted after having driven most of the day and wandering all over the city, well, all over Chippewa County, and Berkeley, and all this.
2452554	2458177	And we stopped at AM, PM there, and I had to circle back around so I could actually get back there to get some coffee.
2458957	2464780	And I ended up pulling out and going to the Garden Highway and some to the exit on the 5, going, you know,
2465100	2469343	I'm trying to find my way out and I got pulled over and my tags need renewing.
2470544	2479472	But they wanted to search the trunk and do all this stuff and it turned out it turned out that they were looking for someone.
2480473	2484396	They were asking all of our IDs and checking everything but they left me off with a warning.
2484436	2485977	Were they looking for someone that looks like you?
2487018	2487638	Of all things?
2487758	2488199	I don't know.
2488219	2491201	It was my evil twin Skippy.
2491341	2491582	Wow.
2493385	2495386	I like how you have an evil twin named Skippy.
2495466	2497147	Skippy Sakura, Dark Skippy.
2497588	2498368	Light Sakura.
2498488	2499409	It was Light Sakura.
2499629	2500029	No.
2501090	2509796	But, um, but, uh... Well, you know one of the nicknames for evil Sakura is Hiyakeshita Sakura, which is December.
2510096	2512417	Does Skippy have a mustache like evil Spock?
2512577	2512858	No.
2512878	2513038	No!
2513138	2516900	Alright, I'm sorry.
2516940	2517881	Anything else, Dark Sakura?
2518141	2518581	Yes!
2518721	2519001	Okay.
2519922	2521323	You didn't give me a ticket.
2521863	2522524	I got to go.
2523587	2531089	And then we heard a sort of yelling fight at the Chevron station, which was stupid.
2531509	2538590	I said, man, people, if you're going to argue with somebody and talk shit, no one else cares to hear your fucking nonsense.
2539650	2543831	Go keep it to yourselves, or talk somewhere like civil human beings.
2544231	2545892	I said, that bitch!
2547572	2550153	You know, be civil.
2551213	2551853	Be mature.
2553448	2554548	GameGuru corrected me.
2554608	2556329	EvilSpock had a beard, not a mustache.
2556729	2558109	Sorry, NerdTrekky.
2558350	2558870	I'm just kidding.
2559550	2560190	I'm so rude.
2561711	2562411	Also, one last thing.
2563131	2566652	A semi-F you to the ending of Doctor Who.
2568213	2569693	The season ending of Doctor Who.
2571093	2572634	Because it was sort of a cop-out.
2573613	2578575	And it was, as a fangirl, I did have my fangasm, and I'm sorry.
2579315	2583076	I want to look as good as Liz Sladen when I am 60 years old.
2583996	2585197	Because that woman is gorgeous.
2586977	2591118	But, um, but it was, it was, it was a bit of happy at the end.
2591158	2592519	Just a little copy out-y.
2593239	2594319	A little copy out-y.
2594359	2599381	But I'm wondering, there's two people who are, no, I don't want to spoil it.
2599401	2602482	I don't want to spoil it, I'm not gonna just, ahhh!
2606994	2607334	Next!
2608075	2609116	Um, let's see.
2610016	2616742	I would have said FD to programming, but I don't have reason to do that anymore.
2617863	2620525	So I'm going to say FD to my car being in the shop still.
2621494	2641046	Unfortunately, the thermostat housing is busted and leaking coolant, so I took it in on the 4th of July, and unfortunately, the dealership was closed, and they were unable to fix it, so now I have to wait for my car to...
2641932	2646555	until Monday when the dealership is open because that's the only place that has the park.
2647616	2648137	So that sucks.
2649398	2653300	Even though I could have driven my car, you know, leaking coolant as I've been doing.
2653781	2654401	Might not have been fun.
2655362	2659245	It was alright, but, you know, I just want to get it fixed.
2659485	2661166	Alright, let's keep the FUs moving.
2661186	2662067	I'm going to make mine quick.
2662207	2662887	FU to drama.
2663928	2665309	FU to unnecessary drama.
2665529	2665970	It's sad.
2666930	2668952	Makes me pain in places I didn't know I had.
2669012	2669272	Rama!
2670433	2671274	Which rhymes with drama.
2672079	2672379	Hey!
2672439	2673100	Ranma Drama.
2674180	2675601	That should be a podcast you should do.
2675661	2676301	Ranma Drama.
2677161	2678742	Ranma does not rhyme with drama.
2679102	2684005	I know, I'm just, in my real ghetto, don't know how to speak thing.
2684125	2685966	Okay, Drama Llama Rama.
2687006	2688387	I'm going to let that one slide.
2689387	2692969	You should have a podcast where you just talk about drama in the cosplay world.
2693009	2693790	I bet it's hilarious.
2694270	2696531	Oh, I do slip some in there from time to time.
2696671	2697431	Alright, FU's of the Week.
2697451	2697932	I need to stop.
2697952	2698412	FU's of the Week.
2698973	2703897	First, F you to people who have made my vacation a living hell that started it off.
2704337	2705698	I don't need to hear from you.
2705999	2706579	Leave me alone.
2707280	2709982	Second, F you to Continental Airlines.
2710322	2718669	Yes, my friend will help me out, but still, I don't want to be stuck in Texas for nine hours, okay?
2720084	2726849	George Bush, and your luggage went to New Orleans, which sounds so much like Sacramento.
2726869	2730692	But your luggage did come back from its early Mardi Gras, like Sauce said.
2730892	2735575	Yeah, but the thing is, when I opened up the bag, there was no tequila, no alcohol, no nothing.
2736196	2736956	That's an evil bag.
2736996	2737436	Or boobs.
2737837	2738397	Exactly.
2738457	2739278	Not even beads.
2739418	2740158	I mean, really.
2740298	2744561	All there was was, you know, parts of Hurricane Katrina and...
2745540	2746882	Boo, too soon.
2747924	2749066	No, dude, no.
2749567	2750549	Alright, Dark Tetsuya.
2751490	2753574	Fuck this heat.
2753614	2754776	Yeah, fuck the heat.
2755177	2755858	I am dying too.
2757126	2757446	Oh, sorry.
2758507	2760428	You gotta give a nice, loud, hearty, fuck the heat.
2760548	2762208	Sorry, yeah, fuck this heat.
2762289	2763089	There you go.
2763109	2763529	A little better.
2763889	2764610	Alright.
2764630	2766891	Yeah, I'll second the fuck you to the heat.
2767011	2768351	I'll second the fuck you to drama.
2768772	2773374	Fuck you to Ubisoft for not making sure that a game works before they push it out the door.
2774274	2781658	Speaking of, of course, Ghost Recon Assault Warfighter 2, which decides to crash as soon as I load a level.
2782718	2786660	If you're not being able to drive yet, not being able to learn to drive yet, because of this heat...
2787639	2789061	Here is driving me crazy
2802639	2804279	Death, death, blood, shit, and puke.
2804299	2804639	And cornflakes.
2829887	2854908	Okay, in actual news, I really have to give it to the male population of Canada because there is a study that has come out, a survey actually that Microsoft put out wondering how many, well out of a thousand gamers in Canada, how many of them play naked?
2855862	2857745	And this is something we really needed to know.
2858005	2860408	This was scientifically sensitive.
2860428	2861590	We need to know this information.
2861610	2864093	17% of men game naked.
2864373	2867698	And 9% of women game naked.
2867718	2868499	Ha ha ha!
2872443	2874643	Like all the time, or just have once in a while?
2874744	2875724	Or like have before?
2876224	2879945	I don't know, but get plastic wrap for your controller, please.
2880945	2882105	Here's my question.
2882625	2887066	They say this about Canadian gamers, but I'm wondering if it's true about American gamers.
2887186	2888507	Wait a minute.
2889507	2890607	I'm wondering something here.
2891407	2897528	I wonder if the people who took the survey counted, say, taking a handheld into the bathroom as gaming naked.
2897809	2899429	It's a valid question.
2899989	2901069	It's a valid question.
2901089	2904710	Okay, outside of the handheld in the bathroom, who has ever gamed naked?
2904851	2906151	DarkSakura, have you ever gamed naked?
2906631	2907111	Yes, I have.
2908132	2908892	Do you remember what game?
2911012	2912413	Well, first of all, I was running a fever of 103.
2912473	2913093	Okay.
2914814	2915594	It probably wasn't DDR.
2916576	2918436	No, it was actually Super Mario 3, I think.
2918696	2919457	No, it was before that.
2920177	2920877	I think it was Top Gun.
2921397	2921657	Nice.
2922517	2923697	Loki, have you ever gamed naked?
2924157	2926318	I always game naked under my clothes.
2926598	2927058	No, really?
2927378	2927738	No, really?
2927878	2928938	No, I haven't.
2928998	2930419	Okay, so we're 50% so far.
2931419	2932619	Ranma, ever game naked?
2933379	2937560	Normally my lawyer would tell me not to answer, but yeah.
2938480	2940541	And it was Dance Dance Revolution.
2940721	2942661	Magic image.
2943621	2944723	Here's the thing, here's the thing.
2945444	2945925	Me too.
2948931	2953178	When I was done, there was a bunch of fangirls outside wanting my autograph with the other pen.
2954040	2955362	I didn't do it in a public setting.
2955422	2956424	I'm sorry?
2957301	2958302	You have to try it.
2958402	2959662	I was in my own house.
2959763	2961544	I didn't know the window.
2961584	2963585	I wasn't... Close the shades!
2963965	2964445	Alright, alright.
2964826	2966607	Why didn't I defend what they want?
2966727	2966807	Drew?
2967127	2967587	Drew?
2967868	2968888	To make them want it more.
2968908	2969589	Drew Bowles.
2969829	2971230	Drew, have you ever gamed nude?
2971590	2973691	I have to say with all confidence, I have not.
2974192	2974872	I don't plan to.
2974892	2976533	You never... See, I've even... I don't plan to.
2976553	2978975	I've lied naked in the bed playing PSP.
2979115	2979435	Yeah.
2979855	2982276	Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?
3009377	3010239	Have you ever read a book?
3018993	3020454	Are they trying to do Naked Fun Games?
3020834	3022915	GameGuru asked, is Jess wearing underwear, Kat?
3022935	3024436	I vote for more Naked Fun Games.
3024796	3026137	I'm all for Naked Twister.
3026417	3027377	Naked is naked.
3028998	3030319	Naked is just naked.
3030939	3032000	It's just naked.
3032020	3035762	People are too bent up.
3036422	3041404	This is actually one of the things we talked about in my massage school about working on people's gluteal muscles.
3041444	3042125	Don't be afraid.
3042205	3043085	It's just a butt.
3043125	3044006	You've got one too.
3044866	3046427	And if they fart, they fart.
3047785	3050908	I've had people fart on the table, Rob, and one of those people is in this room.
3053570	3053870	Nice.
3054250	3054551	Alright.
3055992	3056672	I'm not naming names.
3056712	3063998	Let's go to while the comedy is still going here on Orange Lounge Radio, let's go to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

3498169	3498909	Next question.
3500310	3504291	Loki recently confessed to a big crime.
3505922	3508863	He was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.
3509983	3513184	When the police asked him to confess, he confessed.
3513644	3514504	Yes, I did it.
3515084	3519485	I hacked PlayStation.com because the website didn't have enough blank.
3521426	3522306	Fucking ding.

3540379	3540799	Dang.
3541719	3546020	Yeah, that doesn't mean I have an answer.
3553602	3554722	Alright, I'm going for that one.
3555522	3555903	Alright.
3556963	3558063	It sounds like everybody's dinged.
3558123	3560204	Oh, I didn't copy-paste the question to Rapid Slasher.
3560264	3561484	Shit, he's probably still thinking.
3564264	3565305	Badhost, no cookie.
3568067	3568887	Please hurry.
3570228	3571369	Because I'm slow that time.
3571429	3573190	Alright, back with the music.
3573210	3574331	Well, Rapid Slasher, thanks.
3574671	3576413	Loki recently confessed to a big crime.
3576493	3578614	He was the one that hacked Playstation.com.
3578954	3581156	When the police asked him to confess, he confessed.
3581196	3581856	Yes, I did it.
3582237	3584939	I hacked Playstation.com because the website didn't have enough.
3585539	3587620	Alright, we got an answer from Rapid Slasher.
3587640	3590643	So GS68, the website didn't have enough.
3591383	3591984	Pylons.
3592525	3593225	Pylons.
3604719	3605619	Old standby answer.
3605639	3606080	All right, there we go.
3606100	3607300	So we have pylons and tits.
3607780	3610561	Ranma, the website did not have enough.
3611242	3612002	Prawn.
3612262	3613142	Prawn.
3613823	3614923	Not a match with tits.
3615103	3615983	Not a match with tits.
3616063	3617164	Prawn is not tits.
3617904	3619105	Prawn is wannabe tits.
3619565	3622086	All right, DarkTetsuya, the website didn't have enough.
3622106	3624647	Iraqi suicide baby.
3624747	3627748	Iraqi suicide baby, says DarkTetsuya.
3628885	3630987	I don't get the joke, what's the joke?
3631007	3632128	It's a Starcraft joke
3646543	3647224	Oh my god.
3647244	3649266	The guy that made the over 9,000.
3650287	3651327	Oh my god.
3651388	3653069	Alright, well shit, that's a match.
3653129	3655611	Congratulations, GS68 is on the board with a point.
3655651	3656712	That's a match for pylons.
3657053	3659655	Alright, Loki, the website did not have enough.
3659795	3660215	Cleavage.
3660556	3661096	Cleavage!
3661596	3663318	Is that a match with tits, judges?
3663378	3666881	No, because cleavage is the... It's a match!
3668302	3670224	I will say a half point.
3670684	3672286	A half point for Rapid Slasher.
3673109	3674230	A half point for rapid slasher.
3674290	3677873	Hey, as I am the only person in this room that possesses said substance.
3679674	3680615	Alright, there you go.
3681035	3682456	DarkSakura, he didn't have enough?
3682757	3683017	Fuck.
3684378	3686219	PlayStation.com didn't have enough fuck?
3689422	3689922	Alright.
3690943	3693185	Needs meat making.
3693305	3694566	Fuck about it.
3695006	3699990	Alright, and my answer, the website didn't have enough Iraqi suicide babies.
3700090	3702012	I also went with the old stand-by OLR joke.
3704022	3705943	Alright, could have gotten you two points, but there you have it.
3705963	3710827	Alright, one more question, a chance for Rapid Slasher to take over the lead.
3710867	3711787	Are you worried, GS68?
3711827	3712027	No.
3712108	3717111	I think that was a no, it was very quiet.
3717151	3725497	Alright, here we go, question number three, and it's the last one, so your last chance to make a lot of points.
3725537	3725857	Here we go.
3727383	3727463	Damn.
3749298	3749398	Ding!

3776457	3777638	Alright, everybody in the studio looks good.
3778398	3780741	We're just waiting on our chatter.
3791038	3793840	Chatter, if you need help, there's tons of answers in chat right now.
3795541	3796682	I like some of these answers.
3797063	3811353	By the way, some of the answers we have for the previous one, on the website, website didn't have enough Eye of Judgment, Worthwhile Content, Porn, Hentai, Super Bacon.
3811914	3814176	Website didn't have enough, that's a good one, that would have been a good one.
3814656	3819700	Alright, and then the other one, the first game I was going to play naked, Captain Commando.
3821206	3822326	Boom Blocks, Texas Hold'em Dick Woman
3847031	3848932	I said Guinness Woman Guinness Woman
3874622	3875243	Very well done.

3875783	3876223	That's a good one.
3876243	3876484	All right.
3876764	3878345	Dark Tetsuya, her name would be?
3878705	3880767	A bit cliche, but Bionic Woman.
3881268	3881988	Bionic Woman.
3882028	3882449	Why not?
3882509	3883690	Her name is Jamie Summers.
3883790	3884210	Why not?
3884370	3884851	Good answer.
3884891	3885251	Good answer.

3889655	3890595	Oh, my gosh.
3890676	3891276	A match.
3891336	3895379	And with that, Rapid Slasher takes the lead to one and a half versus one.
3895780	3896020	All right.
3896040	3896360	Let's see.
3896721	3899223	Loki, the evil robot's name would be?
3899643	3902846	Bitch, get back in the kitchen and make me dinner, woman.
3905100	3905320	DarkSakura
3926533	3927093	Wow, that's great.
3927113	3928674	Did you hear that on Justin.TV?
3928894	3930374	DarkSakura, her name would be?
3930835	3931215	Woman.
3931535	3932815	She doesn't need anything else.
3934196	3936256	That's all you need to know.
3937197	3938257	That would be pretty evil.
3938897	3939037	Alright.
3940950	3941410	I got the finger.
3942291	3943331	All right, here it is.
3943491	3943752	Here it is.
3943792	3946533	If I said Dick Woman, then GS68 wins.
3947174	3952837	My answer, if I made an evil robot, her name would be Sniper Woman.
3953357	3960681	Sniper Woman, which unfortunately is not a match, which means Rapid Slasher wins in a narrow victory of one and a half to one.
3961462	3964443	GS68, I'm sorry you're the loser tonight.
3965724	3967345	So is there any final words you have?
3969625	3970885	I am already... Oh, sorry.
3970925	3972046	You get hung up on because you lost.
3972686	3973006	All right.
3973466	3974606	Hey, that's what the losers get.
3974646	3975167	I'm sorry.
3975427	3976007	Pwned.
3976267	3976707	Oh, come on.
3976747	3978668	GS68's been on the show a million times.
3978988	3980028	Nothing there.
3980248	3980968	He knows the rules.
3981188	3986330	Rapid Slasher, if you have anything you want to plug, send me a private message and I will plug it.
3986550	3988690	As the winner, you get to plug whatever you want.
3989111	3994132	Meanwhile, Loki's going to get to the next story while I assess the damage of the party foul.
3994732	4000097	There is another rumor of a game coming out now for, I believe, the PSP.
4001078	4008325	And this would make sense since, well, they've had other similar collections on the PSP as well.
4008885	4011168	It is the Star Soldier collection.
4011268	4017153	It's supposed to contain four different Star Soldier games, including Star Soldier.
4018174	4018274	Um...
4019435	4022897	Let's see, Final Soldier and Soldier Blade.
4023638	4027880	And one other one, oh, Superstar Soldier, I guess, as well.
4029381	4030181	So that's kind of cool.
4030301	4033363	Oh, I'm sorry, and I got this all wrong here.
4033723	4038106	Superstar Soldier, Final Soldier, Soldier Blade, and Star Parodier.
4038806	4039547	Star Parodia!
4040638	4047582	and it would retail, I guess, in Japan for 2,940 yen, which is less than $30 US.
4047902	4048662	I do want this.
4049123	4050864	Star Parodia is like the best game ever.
4051344	4054505	Haven't I done Star Parodia on a classic game?
4055706	4056106	Possibly.
4056206	4057887	I think you did one form of Parodius or another.
4057927	4058808	I don't know if it was that specific one.
4058828	4059288	No, it's not Parodius.
4059308	4060028	It has nothing to do with Parodius.
4060048	4060289	Oh, my bad.
4060449	4062390	Star Parodia is a parody of Star Soldier.
4062450	4063390	That I don't think you've done.
4063950	4066672	I'm all about Star Soldier myself, so do want.
4067648	4068008	All right.
4068729	4069610	Sounds pretty awesome.
4069730	4075775	It's funny, though, because on the little screenshot that they have, or box shot or whatever it is, they have a bunch of the Bombermen guys running around.
4076856	4077216	All right.
4077936	4083681	I never saw Rapid Slasher send something he wanted to plug in private message, so I guess that's that.
4084402	4084762	We'll see.
4084802	4085663	Maybe after this story.
4086643	4087684	Burnout Paradise.
4087744	4093949	This is one of those games I played for a couple days, and I was like, eh, I'm over it, which is sad because Burnout was such a fun series.
4094029	4094370	But, you know...
4095129	4115917	hats off to the folks at Criterion because they keep trying to invent new ways to make the game more fun granted they had a patch of theirs get pushed back a little bit but guess what's coming for the next patch this is very interesting Criterion is considering after this whole Cagney update is done they're going to put planes in Burnout Paradise yes planes
4116604	4118225	Like pilot wings, planes.
4119086	4120787	I'd like to see an airborne takedown.
4120927	4125850	That could be very interesting, but I worry about all the fan videos on YouTube.
4125931	4127832	I want free running to be in there.
4128272	4132975	I want people just running and then running into other people, and that's what's going to happen.
4132995	4134557	They're going to explode and crash.
4134837	4143503	I will say, though, referring to an earlier story in the evening, it would be pretty awesome to fly the plane in Burnout Paradise with a custom soundtrack playing Danger Zone.
4145305	4145765	DarkSakura
4167776	4169777	Hells yeah, I am.
4171397	4174238	One of the, I'd have to say, best RPG series ever.
4174358	4175158	Let me untangle myself.
4176278	4177559	It's not called Let Me Untangle Myself.
4177699	4179059	That would be a pretty fun RPG.
4180359	4181900	It's a Phantasy Star.
4182300	4183960	And they're doing a Phantasy Star Portable.
4184040	4186781	There's a demo that is actually out.
4190362	4191542	Let me see if I can find it.
4191723	4196644	Yeah, on the official website, I do believe, at fantasystar.sega.jp slash PSP.
4198345	4207628	It's got new characters and some downloadable content, and the demo is going to be out on July 14th, and the game will be out on the 31st, but that is Japan only.
4208528	4210649	And it will be 301 megabytes in size.
4212789	4213289	Sounds interesting.
4213309	4213970	The demo, sorry.
4214390	4214870	Could be fun.
4215430	4217651	It's supposed to be, as they say, an extensive demo.
4219159	4225045	you can access story mode and multi-mode and you can bring your saved data from the demo to the final game
4226897	4255013	Alright, I got the plugs from Rapid Slasher before we get to tonight's Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Rapid Slasher would like to plug his YouTube channel available at youtube.com slash user slash Rapid Slasher And I'm looking at it right now, it looks like he has a two girls one cup reaction video Oh, those are always fun It looks like a friend is watching it on a cell phone there or something So there you have it And a video called Chewbacca, which I can only imagine what that is Stop it
4256041	4260642	Rabbit Slasher would also like to say, Indiana represent, and go see Radiohead this summer.
4261763	4262943	Radiohead.
4263363	4263663	All right.
4264004	4265444	I didn't know Radiohead was going out on tour.
4266784	4267785	They have an album out.
4267845	4268265	We might have to.
4268285	4269085	Rainbow's album.
4269145	4270526	DarkSakura, we might have to go do that.
4270686	4271426	I love Radiohead.
4271606	4272166	I'm thinking that.
4272186	4273487	Except Tom York is nuts.
4273827	4274067	All right.
4274327	4280229	Look, before we get to the Skype line tonight, we have a very special late-breaking report, like live stuff going on right now.
4280729	4283130	We're going to our OLR correspondent who's on the line.
4283170	4283650	Are you there?
4284650	4288051	DJ Tyrant What did you use our name to get into this week?
4309993	4315496	I went to Anime Expo, which actually just ended today, and I just got home about an hour ago.
4316437	4319659	And I got to play some games that aren't out yet, got to check out some stuff.
4319979	4321940	Okay, first question I've got to ask.
4322460	4325382	Anime Expo gets a little bit of a bad rap out there in the community.
4326322	4329184	I've never been, so this is not a personal... That's okay, it sucks.
4329224	4333807	But all I've ever heard is it sucks, anime sucks, suckspo, anime, you know.
4334667	4337749	Does it still suck, or do you think people might need to pay at another visit?
4338847	4343651	I think people might need to pay it another visit because they've restructured a lot of the upper people.
4344151	4344952	Did it suck as bad as last year?
4344972	4346373	It seems a lot more organized now.
4347574	4349395	Did it suck as bad as last year, asked DarkSakura.
4350275	4350736	Oh, no.
4351076	4352957	It was much improved over last year.
4352977	4355779	I heard that nothing could suck as badly as last year has ever sucked.
4356580	4357721	Last year was pretty bad.
4358101	4360323	In order to come up, you've got to hit rock bottom first.
4360483	4362044	So there you go, rock bottom.
4362784	4367408	How many rabid Odon Host Club fangirls did you have to push your way through to get to the games?
4368443	4368904	Too many.
4369786	4371508	Alright, let's talk about games.
4371548	4373431	What type of video game stuff did you see at Anime Expo?
4374673	4380443	Lots and lots of fighting games, because that seems to be pretty much 90% of any anime video game.
4381324	4381684	Fair enough.
4382691	4386033	Were they lots of fighting games based on animes, like any particular ones that jump out in your mind?
4386674	4388995	Yeah, well, the typical Naruto games.
4389255	4393298	Namco had their PS3 Naruto game, and that looked really good.
4393318	4394579	The graphics were really nice on that.
4395720	4407147	And D3 had their Wii Naruto fighting game, and so that's probably not going to be that great because it's on the Wii, and Wii fighting games generally are not that great.
4407307	4407808	What was that, Loki?
4407828	4414916	I was going to say, which, by the way, if you want to play the demo for the PS3 one, you can download the second episode of Core, and they have an exclusive demo in there.
4415577	4416558	Are you subscribed to Core?
4416778	4417479	No, but I read it.
4417659	4419601	I ain't buying demos.
4419621	4420142	What the hell?
4420182	4420923	It's not stupid.
4421043	4421584	Sorry, Jimmy.
4421764	4422325	What else was there?
4423509	4432551	I went to actually Arc System Works panel, which does Guilty Gear, and they showed off a couple trailers for some games that are coming out.
4432831	4438732	Castle Shikigami 3, which is a Wii title, it's another one of those shumps.
4439592	4444713	It looks really beautiful, and it looks a lot like Hikaruga.
4446673	4447293	Sounds like fun.
4447333	4449674	Were there any non-fighting games there, or was that like all you saw?
4451246	4452848	That was all that was pretty much playable.
4453008	4454430	Soul Calibur 4 was playable.
4455050	4456932	It looked really, really beautiful.
4458474	4460436	Street Fighter 4?
4461397	4462078	Yeah, Street Fighter 4.
4462138	4464541	Capcom was not there, so Street Fighter 4 was not there.
4464741	4465782	Well, tell us more about Soul Calibur 4.
4465962	4467724	Did you get some hands-on play with Soul Calibur 4?
4467764	4468105	How was it?
4469439	4473641	No, I didn't, but it looked pretty much like a standard Soul Calibur game.
4473661	4476843	I mean, there were only three playable characters, none of the exclusives.
4476903	4479524	No Darth Vader or Yoda or Kratos.
4479664	4480104	Just kidding.
4481365	4481565	Funny.
4482540	4483300	Yeah.
4483761	4488042	Another one from Arc Systems' work was Battle Fantasia, which I got to spend some time with.
4488622	4491844	It's another fighting game, but it's exclusive for the 360.
4492204	4497566	It'll have Xbox Live Play coming out, I think, September 16th, they said.
4498346	4499247	There is a PS3 version.
4499267	4501128	Very similar to Third Strike in that there's...
4502408	4503729	A parry system in it.
4503889	4508150	You hit the R1 shoulder button and the next attack is parried.
4509050	4514112	And if you do it and there's no attack, there's kind of a cooldown from when you can attack again.
4514592	4520354	Yeah, I know there is a PS3 version of that because I'm actually trying to get a friend right now who's over in Japan to import it for me.
4520434	4522994	But I'm surprised they're not localizing that.
4523034	4524395	Probably a paid exclusive.
4524715	4526335	Yeah, that came up a lot during their panel.
4526375	4528476	Everyone was like, are you bringing it over for a PS3?
4528496	4531017	And they haven't made any announcements yet for that.
4533660	4540442	They also showed a trailer for the Phoenix Wright style game, Jack Hunter.
4541622	4546663	That was kind of funny to see that because it looks almost exactly like Phoenix Wright.
4547244	4549464	Did you see Blue Blaze Calamity Trigger?
4550404	4553545	Yeah, I saw the game and the line was huge for it.
4553865	4557586	It looks very similar to the Guilty Gear XX series.
4558507	4560147	It has the same style of gameplay.
4561949	4564010	and there's a blocking system in it.
4565091	4580098	I got to check it out and on that top bar, if you've played Street Fighter Alpha 3, there's a guard meter where you can only guard so much and it's separate in that game but in this game, both people share it so I can see some strategies playing out because of that.
4580906	4586812	I'm a little surprised that you didn't see more RPGs, MMOs from little companies and all that kind of stuff.
4586952	4591116	I saw a ton of the little MMOs, MapleStory.
4592157	4593499	They got me to sign up for that.
4593519	4594560	I'll check it out.
4594600	4595000	Sucker.
4597142	4597943	Well, they gave me $10 in free...
4601607	4603668	Nickel and Diamond DLC or whatever it is.
4603728	4605569	Was it worth selling your soul?
4606630	4608050	I didn't sell my soul yet.
4609351	4609671	Alright.
4610312	4610552	Yet.
4610852	4611232	Keyword.
4611652	4611952	Alright.
4613313	4615034	Jimmy, before we let you go, we gotta know.
4615114	4618116	Thank you for giving us the fill on what we missed on Anime Expo, but I gotta know.
4618616	4620817	Best cosplay and worst cosplay?
4621738	4622098	Oh, yeah.
4622984	4623384	Oh, boy.
4625445	4629927	My favorite cosplay was probably a Captain Falcon that looked pretty darn good.
4630007	4631067	I thought it was pretty funny.
4631407	4631687	Nice.
4631707	4632367	Zero.
4632708	4633568	Worst cosplay?
4634508	4639110	Any of the females that really didn't need to be in skimpy outfits?
4640030	4640510	Oh, God.
4640550	4641171	There you have it.
4642481	4646042	I mean, you have that at every con, though, so I don't know.
4646062	4647463	It's just not appealing.
4647923	4649864	David Hader's awesome.
4650324	4652725	I assume that no cosplayer's got shot being in L.A.?
4652745	4652845	No.
4652865	4654125	I'm shocked.
4654686	4656066	I don't know why everyone assumes that.
4658467	4660748	All right, well, DJ Tyrant, I'll see you at BlizzCon.
4660828	4661608	We're in a nicer area.
4661628	4662248	Yeah, definitely.
4662309	4663489	It'll be a blast.
4663769	4664089	It will.
4664529	4664849	All right.
4665150	4666170	Take care, Jimmy.
4666410	4666910	Thanks, guys.
4667250	4667651	Take care.
4667771	4668631	Thanks for being on the show.
4669778	4674379	Alright, we like hearing from Jimmy, and I'm glad he has a place to come on and talk, sadly, because STFU is no more.
4675300	4675740	That's sad.
4676000	4691165	But there is, uh, STFU is kind of combined now, you know, you got half of, uh, STFU, you got DMN, and you got, uh, Travis Donovan, they do a show together, here on, uh, All Games Radio, it's Under Station Live, it airs Saturday nights, and it was the show I started on years ago, and DarkSakura was a guest like 50 million times.
4692085	4692665	So there you have it.
4693085	4696806	Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and it's already ringing.
4696846	4698207	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
4699383	4701104	Hey, this is the other New Yorker, SSJ100Matt.
4701144	4701784	Yo, what's up Matt?
4701844	4702404	Yeah, yeah.
4702424	4702944	What was that?
4725134	4725555	Chrono Trigger
4736274	4737155	Chrono... No, you're right.
4737195	4739476	Not according to me, but I still think it's pretty darn good.
4739617	4742979	Not even as good as some of the Final Fantasy games I've played, but that's alright.
4744280	4747262	Even I will probably get the Chrono Trigger remake on DS.
4747542	4752026	There was this collective explosion of fangasm on the internet this week when that was announced.
4752066	4752946	That was pretty crazy.
4754528	4759271	My LiveJournal friends list exploded, and I'm sure people's Twitters blew themselves up as well.
4759711	4759832	Um...
4760892	4767075	What would you, as a Chrono Trigger fan, really want to see in this new DS version, Matt?
4768276	4775939	Well, I assume it's going to be based on the SNES version, but I think just keep everything the way it was.
4776059	4780481	I think they said they were going to add more dungeons and online play.
4781301	4782002	That's fine with me.
4783162	4787044	I mean, I beat the game 10,000 times since it's come out, so...
4787987	4794608	What would you have thought, Matt, if it had turned out that this game was a 3D remake in the same vein as Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4?
4794688	4796109	Would you have been a little scared or what?
4798609	4799970	I probably would have been a little scared.
4800010	4801450	I probably still would have bought it.
4802750	4806911	Still would have bought it, just to support Chrono Trigger, but a little bit apprehensively.
4807611	4814433	Because, you know, maybe if we each buy 50 copies, they'll make Radical Dreamers or some sort of sequel.
4814473	4815033	Dream on.
4815690	4816630	Dream on with that one.
4816670	4817251	No, you never know.
4817451	4817911	You never know.
4818111	4820192	Stranger things have happened, so there you have it.
4820652	4825354	Well, I have my fingers crossed that Chrono Trigger will do the fans justice.
4825734	4827094	I have not played the game in so long.
4827154	4830596	I haven't played Chrono Trigger since I was a kid, so it'll be fun to revisit that series.
4831396	4831716	You know what?
4831756	4841380	It's good because a lot of the younger generation who were born in the 90s, they'll actually get a chance to play this because I'm sure there's plenty of people in the chat room who have never played it before.
4842242	4844703	I am kind of curious, though, how the whole two-screen thing is going to work.
4844923	4846944	I'm very curious to see what they do with that.
4847024	4849725	So we'll be waiting for some more screenshots and stuff.
4850165	4851946	If they make it 3D, they better do it justice.
4852086	4852486	They're not.
4853006	4853586	It's Sprite.
4853766	4854567	It's old-school Sprite.
4855527	4855767	All right.
4856007	4857268	Well, Matt, thank you so much for calling in.
4857308	4858668	Any other last words you want to say real quick?
4859829	4860769	Yeah, two things.
4860809	4863170	When are you guys coming out to New York again?
4865194	4867336	Hey Joe, hey Joe, hey Joe, hey Joe, hey Joe What?
4890657	4891898	Wait a minute, where have I heard that before?
4892058	4892638	Sounds familiar.
4893078	4893359	All right.
4894199	4894819	Later, Matt.
4894839	4895900	For that, you get hung up on it.
4895940	4896400	Later.
4896841	4898562	All right.
4898582	4901783	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4901843	4903785	We have got room for about, how long are we running this?
4904005	4905165	Oh, shit, we're almost to an hour and a half.
4905586	4908968	Maybe like one more call on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.
4908988	4911749	1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4913090	4915511	Sack Anime, a little closer to home, last week of August.
4915631	4916012	Be there.
4916172	4918413	Oh, it's Penny Arcade Expo, same weekend.
4918453	4918873	Can't do it.
4919434	4919874	Sorry, guys.
4921946	4922286	Sorry.
4922746	4923667	Fine, I'll go.
4923767	4925687	They do like five SAC animes a year.
4925707	4926727	They do two.
4928188	4930209	It seems like there's a con at the Sonic Center every month.
4930229	4931949	They have two SAC animes a month.
4932709	4935870	Sorry, two SAC animes a year and four SAC animes a month.
4936691	4937071	I wish.
4937311	4940492	And four smaller SAC comic cons a year.
4940652	4940952	All right.
4941092	4943653	Thank you for the local news.
4943833	4944013	Do it.
4944033	4944873	I love Sunrise Mall.
4944893	4945413	That's awesome.
4945433	4945693	All right.
4946093	4946454	Here we go.
4946474	4946654	Look.
4946794	4948134	We'll stop with the local chat.
4948174	4949374	Let's talk to somebody on the skyline.
4949415	4950355	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
4950375	4950715	Who's this?
4952532	4952953	Oh, hi.
4953353	4955455	I spaced out there for a sec.
4955475	4956457	This is Gold Banjo.
4956517	4956937	That's alright.
4956977	4959941	The heat is making us spacey too, but it's starting to cool off a little bit, thank God.
4959961	4960501	What's on your mind?
4960541	4965487	Actually, it's not as bad over here in New England and New Hampshire, but I feel bad for you guys.
4965727	4966348	That's alright.
4966628	4967810	You guys have to deal with humidity.
4967830	4968550	At least we don't have that.
4968951	4969512	What's on your mind, buddy?
4970635	4978342	Um, well, actually, I'm one of those Chrono Trigger people, and, well, once again, I know you might not be as crazy about it.
4978903	4982886	I don't actually even know much about the game, and I know that I have to play it.
4983707	4985168	So, that just goes to show you.
4985449	4986610	I think that's almost an adage.
4986650	4987951	How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
4988683	4989884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5015256	5017417	And to the new generation, do it, or I'll come over the internet and kick your ass.
5041744	5042805	The new generation.
5043866	5045447	So old.
5046528	5048510	Gold Banjo, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
5049590	5051952	No, I just wanted to call in and say that real quick.
5052533	5053293	Alright.
5055815	5056576	That's pretty much it.
5056736	5057756	Have a good night, guys.
5057796	5058177	You too.
5058297	5060258	Have fun with Chrono Trigger DS whenever it comes out.
5060739	5062740	Okay, I'm definitely looking forward to it.
5062760	5065002	Call back and let us know what you think, young whippersnapper.
5066108	5066388	It's hot.
5092760	5094641	Hot Garage is very hot, but thankfully it's cooling.
5094681	5095922	It's getting a little more bearable in here now.
5096562	5098543	Loki, any last-minute stories from you tonight?
5101445	5106388	I've only been looking at stories, unfortunately, because I've been too busy working on stuff.
5107088	5108429	Let's see here.
5109505	5111327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5133956	5142021	and apparently they had an elf loader on there that they were able to run a Genesis emulator.
5143825	5145626	On what now?
5146226	5147987	It's a program called Swap Magic.
5148107	5151009	It was one of those things to run on PlayStation 3.
5152730	5162114	Run, I guess, burn games and stuff like that or region-free stuff on the PlayStation 2, but they ran it on the PlayStation 3 and were able to play Genesis Simulator on there.
5162194	5169438	Sure, you could run Linux or something like that on your other operating system on that and easily run games that way, but
5170711	5173072	That's not as fun.
5173112	5174794	That was one thing that was kind of interesting.
5177015	5177855	Let's see.
5178756	5182218	Also, the Wrath of the Lich King beta signups are open.
5182578	5182798	Shh!
5183779	5185200	Don't tell people because I want the key.
5186361	5196387	Well, actually, speaking of things we missed, if you were an Uru Live fan, a Missed Online fan, on GameTap, they are pulling that.
5196567	5199909	The publishers are taking it back and apparently going to revive the community.
5200732	5201432	Oh, good for them.
5201952	5202333	That's good.
5202633	5205534	So if you're all three people that enjoyed that, come on back.
5206814	5207434	There you have it.
5207614	5209975	Okay, we've got some other things here real quick.
5210875	5215697	Bomberman's coming to the iPhone with Bomberman Touch, which is interesting.
5216597	5226221	And also, I guess Game, the UK retailer, is going to start publishing some independent games.
5228802	5231424	That's interesting to have a retailer doing that at the front like that.
5231705	5232385	Exclusives.
5232445	5233246	Can you say exclusives?
5233546	5233746	Yeah.
5234327	5242433	And Sony, I guess, is putting out another game that's going to be, I guess, coming out in September called Aqua.
5243014	5249739	And it's a sequel to Aquanauts Holiday, which is sort of like Endless Ocean on the Wii.
5250340	5252281	So think of Africa, but under the sea.
5253282	5254864	And it looks pretty cool, actually.
5256269	5262773	Also, there's a rumor that Golf Tee It Up is supposedly coming to Xbox Live Arcade next week.
5263293	5272238	Whatever the hell that's supposed to be, but apparently it has its Xbox.com page now, so that's on there, as well as, I guess, Pirates vs. Ninja Dodgeball.
5272258	5272818	About time.
5273877	5281984	And then there's also a Guitar Hero homebrew game that's supposed to be coming out towards the end of August, August 20th.
5282044	5283806	It's called Video Game Hero.
5284447	5287510	Two of the tracks that they have on there, Eye of the Tiger and Inspector Gadget.
5287690	5288951	Inspector Gadget.
5289031	5293095	It's the Inspector Gadget theme, which both of them sound kind of like...
5295129	5296732	Very MIDI sounding.
5297172	5301699	But the game, you use the touch screen or the directional buttons.
5301739	5303181	It's kind of like Oda Jam almost.
5304303	5306126	Which, that'd be something else good to bring to the DS.
5306146	5307167	Very interesting.
5307227	5307648	Interesting.
5308697	5309998	Dark Tetsuya, any final thoughts?
5310018	5310539	What the hell is that?
5336576	5336856	Nice.
5337217	5337497	No, I know.
5339419	5341061	That little keychain thing.
5343724	5344945	Ranma, your final thought.
5345505	5346346	This is Cyberman.
5347007	5347808	You were wrong.
5347828	5348649	This is Cyberman.
5350751	5351672	Ranma, your final thought.
5352793	5376243	Google Maps on my phone with GPS has been making me uber geek this entire weekend geek, nerd damn proud of it my final thought is hot DarkSakura exterminate the heap Loki hot chair is hot
5377597	5377897	All right.
