Tonight, July 27th, 2008, will some Nintendo controllers soon be banned?
Is an official HaloCon in the near future?
And a PC gaming service has gone free?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron.
So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic-Con.
Happy, happy, happy, happy.
So what's this?
They're making a new Tron.
Yes.
Just Tron 2.
And Jeff Bridges is in it.
Yeah, I saw that in the trailer.
And he looks evil.
What was up with that trailer though?
Like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away.
Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed.
Buena Vista would.
Hmm.
Remember?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that.
So, I would use that as sort of a past precedent.
Yeah, but still, what are they going to do?
There's like thousands of people at Comic-Con.
You know what I mean?
Especially in those panels.
As far as I can tell, though, this cell phone video was the only thing that I've seen.
So...
Interesting.
Well, whatever they're doing, it works.
But I've never been to Comic-Con.
Maybe next year.
I'm going next year.
The one and only Miglatov, you've probably heard on this show.
He was at Comic-Con.
He was giving me calls pretty much every day.
He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face.
I bet he was intensely... Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while?
Yeah, kind of.
All right.
Speaking of jerks, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
Just kidding.
Hello.
I'm doing fine.
Were you just watching that little preview for Tron 2?
Yes, I had to because I was reading up on it, but I didn't know that they actually had filmed it.
Of course, you have to assume that anything that says do not film, someone's going to film it.
Exactly.
Especially something as widely anticipated as that.
Hey, just think about it.
It'll make a great video game, except then again, there was a Tron 2.0 video game.
That doesn't stop anybody.
Didn't do very well.
I think they should go ahead and try again.
There's a better freeware or shareware light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while.
It's really, really good.
Cool.
I remember Surround on the Atari 2600.
That was just light cycles.
I remember that.
Anyhow, if you want to join us in our chat room, we are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number 289 of our podcast, Damn World.
Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you want to
Join in with the chat.
And I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now.
And some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy and all that stuff.
And some people are commenting about how during the previous show, the Bobby Blackwolf show on All Games Radio, Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was the Bobby Blackwolf show.
Some people in there commenting on that.
If you want to hear that, you've got to listen to Bobby's show though.
He's available at allgames.com.

Gaming Week
I played stuff, actually.
I did finally start Aurora Faint.
And that game's freaking cool!
I don't know much about this game.
Tell us a little bit about Aurora Fate.
It's an iPhone game.
Oh yeah, okay.
It's sort of like how Bejeweled does, except you can only move them horizontally.
But you can sort of slide as you destroy groups.
They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does.
But you can actually move blocks off to the side and move them that way, move them laterally into empty spaces.
So it's sort of a neat thing, and
You can level up and learn new techniques and it's a very cool little game and very pretty and shiny.
and I played this other thing called Color Spiral, but all it is is just drawing really awful circles on the iPhone, so it sucks.
And I got a Sudoku game, just to try it.
I got, it's just called Sudoku Free, and it actually, it's kind of neat, really, you know, easy.
As in, really easy.
As in, eh.
But it's pretty, the interface is pretty.
You can choose your color.
Aurora Faint Battle Maneuver
It sounds a little like Meteos with the whole sideways only movement thing.
You'll have to give it a try.
You'll have to give it a try.
You can actually make a character on my phone if you want.
That's cool.
Or one of these days I'll finally break down and buy an iPhone.
One of these days.
I hear people are still lining up for that stuff.
That's crazy.
But also, I...
I downloaded something else.
I actually think that I might, though, try... This was it.
I was about to download Ms.
Pac-Man.
And apparently, it's utter crap, so I didn't do it.
Because there's no real good way to control it.
I can imagine.
They should do Marble Madness for iPhone, though.
If they can do Monkey Ball, they can do Marble Madness.
Good times.
But Monkey Ball sucks on iPhone, just letting you know.
Really?
Yes.
You have to play just right.
Instead of holding your phone at a perfect flat angle, you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position.
So it's really...
Not good.
I also did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been, because I've been doing a lot of homework.
I did, though, get some fantastic nerd time yesterday.
It wasn't video game related, but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it, and it pissed me off.
I watched a whole crap ton of Stargate SG-1.
I was like, don't make me smile.
You made me take your picture in front of the giant Stargate.
That's right.
That was awesome.
I love me some Stargate, except I do not like Stargate Atlantis.
Not very much.
Before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show, any other games?
No.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.
The Game of Life.
Do we know a bigger nerd?
I'm kidding.
Hi, Travis!
You're great!
Magnetica I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and
I gotta say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I don't really care for the new 3D graphics.
Especially when they have all their, like most of the cutscenes are in-game using the in-game engine.
And when you get really close to some of those characters, man, those textures are really low res.
But overall, it's pretty good.
I played also Korg 10 DS, which isn't really a game, but more of an actual piece of synthesizer software.
So I played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10, I didn't really make much with it.
But it's fun.
It'll be cool to play around with.
And then on the 360...
Wario Land Shake Wario Land Shake
A perfect example of how they can do really good 2D platform games now with the technology that's out there.
All hand-drawn animation.
They have anime cutscenes.
It's really cool.
It really is.
And sadly enough, if only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game at E3, they might have actually saved their little press conference.
But, whatever.
And then, let's see what else did I play...
I think that was about it, actually.
It was pretty brief.
or hell, even 12.
I love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS.
It's kind of interesting because the difficulty, you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty.
If you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2 American like I did, you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty.
You know, you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and just, you didn't really have to grind or anything like that.
You do need to do a little bit, not a lot.
I mean, that gets annoying in role-playing games.
You don't have to do a lot of grinding.
You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't getting completely overpowered by the enemies.
You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you, the speed of how they're attacking, and all of that.
You can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game, and it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience.
Also, you have the new translation and everything.
I really like that they put voice acting in the game.
It's kind of neat.
Even though it only shows up in a few select scenes, they actually pull it off on the DS pretty well.
it's not A plus level voice acting but it's not terrible it does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years my biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki I don't like the graphics I don't like
The look, very much, of what they've given the game.
It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game.
It feels very choppy.
It feels like even Final Fantasy VII looked better than this.
The cutscenes don't have the same style of graphics as the actual game itself.
The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just cartoony.
It's not like Final Fantasy VII where...
The graphics were kind of cartoony but the cutscenes, the characters were also a bit cartoony as well.
It's just it doesn't match whatsoever.
You go with this really super deformed-looking character to ultra-realistic.
I don't know what it is, but I would have almost just preferred redone sprites.
I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games.
Those games are beautiful, and they're still sprite-based, but they look amazing.
I really like the look on those, and that's kind of what I almost wish this had been.
And I see GameGuru in chat is saying, just get Final Fantasy IV Advance.
I mean, yeah, but that was just basically...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
and you can you actually get to Kaipo the desert town you kind of can play your first you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons that will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands and you actually level it up through these silly little ds games like the math game which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game maybe it's just the nerd in me I don't know but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game I like the whole map
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's Prey ability, Cecil's Darkness ability.
These things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters.
That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on Advance, maybe with a new translation.
I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD-based system, even PS2.
Thanks for watching!

OLRDS HATERS
No, I'm not a DS hater.
I like the games that are kind of made for a DS, like Trauma Center.
Great game.
You can't play that really anywhere else.
I mean, I guess you can on the Wii, but that's a whole other story.
Cooking Mama is actually kind of fun on the DS.
There's lots of these types of games on the DS, even things like Metroid Prime Hunters and stuff that you can't really get on other types of systems.
I don't like trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of how to control a game.
And that's the other thing.
That's my other big problem with Final Fantasy IV is that it needs an analog stick.
Trying to control Cecil, which all these years I thought it was Cecil, but according to the voice acting, it's Cecil.
Trying to control Cecil in that 3D environment where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees, it sucks.
Because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little, you know... I don't know if there were other...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
so play a little more at least until you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know how many people I know are going to get this game although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy, fangirl it's worth checking out especially if you've never played the game you've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great
But if you have played the old games, you know, have already kind of made your way through them, I still say it's worth a look.
It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper, because it's a $40 DS game, but it's not going to be a waste of your time.
It is, you know, kind of a different experience.
So, there you have it.
And then Bobby in chat commented again, he said, confirmed, OLR likes to debunk Black Wolf.
Oh, Bobby, you're great.
GameGuru says, look, every port or remake of a NES and Super NES for the DS means no PlayStation Network or Virtual Console port, and that makes me mad.
I kind of agree.
I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade, if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 recreations are any guide, because those were great.
I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone.
I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people, but I would like to see...
A new approach taken to it.
I just kind of don't want it on the DS.
I'd like to see it as a remade for at least the PS2 if nothing else.
Make it a budget title for the PS2 if nothing else.
There'll be tons of people that want it.
Also in my gaming week, I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more Civilization Revolution, which is a game I think is pretty cool.
And I noticed Bobby Blackwolf was playing Civil Revolution.
Speaking of Bobby, he was playing that quite a bit this weekend, so I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on Civilization Revolution.
Even though I'm not that great at the game, he'll probably beat me.
Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it.
Um, and, uh, also I've been playing that new, um, Xbox Live Arcade game that came out.
The, uh, um, the street dancing game, whose name I accidentally closed the window at.
What was it?
The Go Go Beat... Let me look up.
Go Go Beat Steady?
I think that was the name of it.
I had it earlier.
Uh, I played, obviously you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of it.
Go Go Break Steady, that's the name of it.
Uh, I played it for a little bit, and, uh...
I kind of like the concept.
I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this Guitar Room Man style, you know, buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside.
And the better you hit them in rhythm, then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma.
And I kind of thought that was cool.
It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game.
but I know there are people that do get excited for that so I'm glad there's a decent music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone it's worth checking out but I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music I think it could be kind of cool so that's it for my gaming week
and DarkSakura.
Thank you for watching!
Alright, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
Sure.
Alright, alright.
Well, being that E3 was not really this week, but last week, there's been a lot of either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it.
And a couple publishers, one being Bethesda, has been trying to defend E3, saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit.
And...
What they've been saying is before it used to be very bustling, lots of people in there.
But now it's just vacant and not that many people come and visit them.
And I think Bethesda, I mean, they're not...
A small publisher by any means, but at the same time, I remember when you guys visited Bethesda, their booth wasn't that big, not compared to EA or Microsoft or something like that.
So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more, a lot of people might miss going to visit these smaller publishers that are there.
So that kind of sucks.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out.
That was great.
Unfortunately, it was one of those games that was awesome in theory, but the execution, unfortunately, by the time the game actually came out, it didn't work out so well.
But we got excited about it watching it.
It was great in theory.
I actually taped the whole thing.
How they recreated the Arathacon battle was pretty awesome.
God, I know.
That was sweet.
But yeah, anyhow, sorry.
But they just say that it needs to change.
They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they want to change it, but I don't know.
But EA, another company also displeased with the current E3.
Ironically enough, though, they're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now.
They wish to invite the community to the show.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But it's just interesting.
It's not stopping from EA.
Now here we go, another person at EA kind of speaking up saying, gosh, we missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place.
But Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got... I don't know.
Let me put it this way.
And I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with this because they haven't gone to E3 and they want to.
I don't think that they should let the public into E3.
Because as it was, it was so fucking packed before that...
you know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts you're not gonna get anything done what they need to do is find some happy medium between the old E3 and the new E3
so maybe lax up the amount of people that they're allowing to be invited to these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking E3 anymore because it's just too strict but before there was people like Walmart employees that work on their garden section just because Walmart carries video games they got into E3 you know weird shit like that if they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there then I think it would be a little bit better um
I don't know about adding the public.
I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff.
Be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's going to be fucking mobbed.
I got to say this.
This is very interesting, the comments.
Again, I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving us good stuff tonight.
Bobby in our chat room at chat.org.com.
He says, Peter Moore loved the community.
Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiast press last year when Peter Moore was in charge.
This year, they didn't really care about us as much.
And it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very – they're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are –
Way more out there with the community and everything.
I mean, heck, you can get an OLR gamer pick on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
That's saying something right there.
If our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world, you know what I mean?
It kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community.
Kind of interesting.
But, you know, like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how... Okay, let's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness.
Honestly, I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only, but make it kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in.
I think that will really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, namely us.
But it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
I think everybody does.
So why not invite retail?
It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know some of these years it's hard to see everything.
I think that the way that they do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see everything and then you can decide what you need to go see further.
I like that.
I like that a lot because that works for the gamers days.
Digest all the information.
The publishers can make sure that the people that they have the information that they want out there
and if they want to further show it off maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes but hey, this game is playable at our booth, go check it out or hey, let's set up some times to come visit the booth and play the game
Alright, well let's move on.
Talking about more E3 kind of fallout, because obviously, you know, I know it's been a couple weeks now since E3, but it is one of the highlights in the gaming year, and of course Nintendo got a lot of flack for their E3 press conference, and what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of...
I don't know if you want to say they apologized, but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception.
In fact, Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week.
Quote,
An interesting apology of sorts.
But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true?
I guess.
Or at least now.
It's just upsetting because all they showed was games for casual people.
I mean, no.
I hate...
Distinguishing games between casuals and the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays.
But seriously, Wii Music is like an over-glorified toy.
There's no depth to it whatsoever.
It's just crap.
But, Loki, you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chitotown Wars.
Now that is a hardcore game.
But see, that's the thing.
The logo, Loki...
Exactly, but that's one thing that got me excited about it.
They don't actually have to show anything, just say, hey, we're working on this.
I mean, look at a couple years ago, they were showing off a video for Mario Kart Wii.
It didn't come out for two years after that.
Same with The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
They had a really early teaser video for it a few years prior to that, and everyone got hyped.
Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3.
All they have to do is say, you know, that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the final product.
It was great, though.
It was epic in the making.
It showed nothing in the actual in-game footage, but it was epic and theatrical, and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3, even though it didn't come out for a while.
Sony, God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name.
here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick I don't remember her name the new one that replaced Perrin Kaplan or whatever that's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on
I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games.
I mean, I honestly... She may play the DS and play the fucking Brain Age shit, and she may be one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer.
But that's the problem, though, is because they don't play these games, and they don't necessarily have to play a lot of games to be able to... Yeah, that's not their job, though.
Their job isn't to make the games.
It isn't to make the games, but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their audience.
That's what they should do, because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But they didn't have to do that much.
I mean, they just said, oh, Pokemon.
Okay, this is coming out.
They could have showed a trailer for that.
They could have shown Wario Land Shake.
There's a perfect example of a game that can be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player.
Let me ask DarkSakura, because she's been awfully quiet through this, but I'm just kind of curious of your opinion, DarkSakura.
Did Nintendo really make a misstep with this E3, or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place?
I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing.
Just because they obviously addressed the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market.
Because that's the whole big thing with businesses.
You want to increase your market share.
They know if they release a Zelda or a Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market.
We're already loyal.
I'd be preaching to the choir.
I think where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince and I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this if they're trying to convince this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press you know I think that
and DarkSakura.com.
Because they pretty much realize that we already know they're working on something.
They don't have to go and make some sort of claim that, you know, oh, we're doing this when they know we want to keep these gamers, we're going to put out this game.
That goes without saying, there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete to give us.
But you know what?
My wife knows that I love her, but she likes to hear it every now and again.
So this is exactly why we have to do this.
We may assume that they're doing this stuff, but you know what?
If we don't see it enough, we may not assume it anymore.
So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore, Loki?
Is that what it is?
Yes, I think that exactly.
We need to be cuddled.
Okay, we have no more Sega systems, yet we keep getting Sonic games.
Sega knows where their bread and butter is coming from.
Nintendo hasn't succeeded this long.
They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon-eating, chain-to-the-jungle-gem morons.
No mention name of people.
But...
I think that when it and they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they have parameters they have to keep in mind I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out they know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market
But your core is going to come to you every time.
But see, I want to see if this actually works out for them because the problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now, the mom and pops that bought the Wii system to play Wii Sports, now they're anticipating, okay, well, they're going to buy this Wii Sports resort thing.
I hope that's true because if it's not, they're going to end up with another fucking...
Thank you for watching!
But, you know, my thing, and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know, yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a freaking bone.
Like, for instance, if we know that in the new Zelda game, Link is going to ride a gigantic spider, then, like, show us the image of Link riding a giant spider and, you know, put out there, Link and his giant spider friend coming next fall.
You know, give us something to, and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go...
Oh my god, did you see the giant spider?
Exactly, that's all they had to do.
Look at Mario Kart.
Like I said, this is a perfect example.
Mario Kart.
They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a kart, racing around.
That was it.
Nothing from the game, no graphics whatsoever.
It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that, oh my god, Mario Kart's coming.
And it's not like we didn't see Mario Kart coming, because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system.
So...
But still, that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate.
Another Mario game, for all I know, it could be a crappy, and you know this is gonna come anyways, like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf.
But once again, that's not a hardcore game.
That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking Wii to play Wii Sports.
Stop catering to people that play Wii Sports!
There are other games out there.
They sold their systems, didn't they?
Yeah, that's true.
You know what?
We would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports.
I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability.
Just one little thing.
This is where it comes down to.
Bottom line.
Money.
What company is out there... If they were out there to, I guess, be nice and sweet and cuddly, they'd be a not-for-profit organization.
As it is, they have to make money.
What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America your mom has more money than you do?
Well, we've done selective targeting for certain products, and we feel that the adult demographic would be... Okay, go ahead.
I want to say this, though.
Shaoran in chat is great.
He has a title for my new Zelda game.
It's called Legend of Zelda Web of Lies.
All right.
What I was trying to say before is that they probably see something, oh, well...
To expand our market, we're going to appeal to a different demographic.
We're aiming towards the older people who might have been our core group at a younger age.
We're trying to reclaim the market that is now, quote, grown out of video games.
You need to go get a job.
Rob, why do you think that I was in technical writing for a while?
Very nice.
All right, Loki, final thought, then we got to move on.
My final thought.
Basically, it's like this.
It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market.
The problem is, though, is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't going to necessarily do a lot of good for you.
The problem is, you've got to get people confident in your platform because come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4, you're not going to have a lot of people wanting to buy your next system
Thanks for watching!
and that's where you're going to end up hurting.
It's down later on.
I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the JustinTVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read but I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about in there some folks are saying Pokemon MMO is what's needed.
I can't believe it hasn't already happened.
Well, for an example, actually, a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok Online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture your different creatures as your pets, and then once they become loyal, they help you fight.
I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually, you know...
If they can do it on a regular video game, why can't they have it in a multiplayer format?
And then you have, for example, you have your arena system.
You can actually have your gyms be set up that way.
And you've got whoever has the best group or whatever.
So you have a continuously rotating list.
And maybe your gym leader is one of the GMs or something.
Anyhow, let's move on.
I think it's very, very possible.
I know we have more Nintendo news.
Hey, stuff about Reggie.
Okay.
Reggie is like, okay, we know, pretty much.
He said, from an America-centric perspective, to quote, that Wii's storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like WiiWare and Virtual Console.
And he told MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution.
So he says that Nintendo is working on something.
They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something.
But...
I actually think that they're going to... And while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB-based, knowing Nintendo, they're going to try to do something proprietary, something that can't be mimicked, something that no one's going to be able... Well, in theory, no one's going to be able to break and just, you know, hack their own like we used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives, remember?
DarkSakura.com
I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you it'll be something really simple that could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done.
It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing.
Just open up USB to use storage devices.
Your problem's solved right there.
It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer, I mean, it's no different than it is now.
I'm sorry?
Where's the money for them to make from that?
They don't have to make money off everything.
On the official Nintendo USB drives that they'll release in stores along with that for $10 more than the generic brands will cost.
I still think they're going to have some way to system lock it.
Even if they do it via USB, they're going to have some sort of code that you have to read off of the storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only.
I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing to hack the system.
I seriously think that's the case.
That's why they're going to try to protect their investment.
From a business perspective, they're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their pocket.
Or let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system.
Well, they were...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades.
I mean, think about it.
This is my prediction.
We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii.
It's either going to run off of USB or have some sort of
So either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage whatever with the Wii.
And then as it progresses, we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something.
Maybe the new upgrade, they drop the price of the old Wii, bring out the new Wii at the regular price, the storage becomes even more cheap as the time goes by, and we're going to get a new Nintendo.
Yeah.
See, that's why I don't understand they can't do that now, because the price of flash storage has gone down so much.
They could just say, okay, going forward now, all the Wii's that we put out are going to have 4 gigs of storage instead.
Yeah, it'll piss off a lot of people, but you know what?
Tough.
Alright.
At least Reggie admits the problem is out there, even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that.
The whole American-centric perspective.
At least they're finally admitting there's a problem.
Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from.
And this is, at least as far as I've seen too, has been mostly the American market.
So, I think he's saying, well, at least Nintendo of America loves you.
It's our cuddle, Rob.
Interesting.
Maybe that was our cuddle.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Smack him in the fucking face.
Seriously.
Oh, yeah.
We acknowledge there's a problem now.
Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that.
Loki needs a little love.
Would he be so angry if somebody would just... Oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people.
Oh, that would be awesome.
I think that Loki needs something that starts with a D and ends with an E. And it's two words.
And it's called duct tape.
Loki, my only wish is that you take your little media badge at this event that says Orange Lounge Radio and you put a sticker over it that says Bobby Blackwolf Show before you go and interview these people.
I'll take it a step further.
I'll put my name as Bobby Blackpool.
We're just going to have someone follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking point, we'll be like, okay, interview's over.
Next.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
So, speaking of next, Rob.
You would love it if I just put on a mask and dress up like Captain Anger or something like that.
You could be Mr. Furious.
Alright, let's move on.
Apparently, because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing, that certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market.
These would include any Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks.
So, any of your classic controllers, your GameCube controllers, those are going to be taken from the market.
And...
Of course, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck are okay because those only have one analog stick.
And this is all because of that wonderful $21 million patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and Escape that has sued them.
And, you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money.
Or licensing rights.
Do you think it's actually going to happen?
I don't know.
It's, well, I mean, they have to pay them because it's, you know, the verdict has been placed.
The thing is, though, there's... Appeals.
Well... Second level appeals.
Supreme Court appeal.
Well, Anscape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make...
I don't honestly think that they're going to try to make controllers.
I think they just want money.
They would have kind of done it by now.
Lord Katsuhito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat.orangehunter.com Probably.
Most likely.
It's usually the way these things go.
Anyways, Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii Bonus Content feature very soon over in Japan.
It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16-digit code into this bonus thing, and you get a new...
Present, so to speak.
The Wii Speaker Channel is the first thing that's supposed to be using this.
It's coming with that game on the Nintendo DS, I think we talked about it a few weeks ago, that is kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio translation of channels or whatever.
Interesting.
But there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for...
WePoint, free download games, virtual console, sell virtual console games in stores.
Kind of like what Xbox Live does with their own redemption system.
You can buy Uno or Texas Hold'em in a store on a card and give it as a gift.
I don't think that's what this is for.
If it even comes out here.
Yes, and I think the only thing this is, it's to deter piracy.
because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately.
Ironically enough, though, all those bonus things that they're talking about, like the Wii Speaker Channel, link to the internet anyway, so it's not gonna matter.
Well, there is something that I think is going to be very, very, very cool to come out.
At least in Japan.
I don't think we're going to get it here.
But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the Purika, the print club stuff.
But it's actually not quite.
It's called the Digicam Print Channel that's going to be on the Wii.
It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm.
Where...
You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and you can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book that's 1,575 yen or you can get a Mario one that's 2480 yen.
and you can actually even have them printed out to well you can have your Meishi printed out which is a Japanese business card it's like your name card basically the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it but you can have your Meishi with your Wii on it not your Wii but your Mii on it for 500 yen for 30 cards so it's actually pretty cool I wish we could get something like this
Would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game I have on those cards too?
I don't see why not.
I mean, I would think so.
That actually would be a very smart idea to have your friend code be on there.
See, both you and I need to be working at Nintendo.
But I'll tell you what... In the good idea department.
And I'm going to link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down, but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube.
And I'm looking at it.
It's actually pretty cool.
This is actually a...
Fuji Films demo showing how it works.
It's really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes and have messages on them.
It's actually very cool.
And also send them to people.
It seems pretty cool what I'm seeing on this.
Do you think it's something that would work here?
Or is this better for Japan's culture?
I think it's more surrounded around, I would say, how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right.
Why not?
I mean, if the channel already exists, it's just translation.
And on Fujifilm's end, or whatever company they partnered with in America, just a matter of a process.
Fujifilm's got a big presence in America.
I was going to say, Fujifilm's here.
So why not?
Snapfish.
As long as they have a presence of getting the... Are they behind Snapfish?
I don't know.
I'm just mentioning Snapfish.
Every photo company has had to evolve to maintain competition with digital photography.
So I'm sure they have something set up.
The way that I see this is that if rock bands are going through rock band to have their musical presence fortified in the industry when everything is digital download and all that, then why can't the photo companies make use of this?
I think it's a good idea.
GameGuru in chat says, Damn, sooner or later they will fill the Wii with just channels.
Kind of a good point because the Wii only has four screens worth of channels.
I want the channel channel.
The channel channel?
The changed channel channel?
No, unfortunately they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to store all those channels.
Yeah.
Alpha Cananograms in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP.
Big fan of the whole Fujifilm channel idea.
Alright.
We will see.
Well, this isn't for the Wii but it uses the Wii remotes.
There is a brand new homebrew game made called Dark Room Sex Game and what this basically is
is two people will take the Wii remotes and they will kind of make a kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the pornographic sounds there's no images it's just all audio that you hear on the screen and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8
I wish I had brought my Bluetooth adapter.
Next week, though, we can maybe do this on the show.
You know, for that extra... It's all audio anyways.
It'll be awesome.
All right.
Yeah, Gold Banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat.
Weirdest homebrew ever.
But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there, I believe.
They have...
It's the website, itu.dk slash stud slash darkroom And GameGuru in chat says the kind of obvious comment here Why not, you know, have sex?
Because this is safer, you can't contract babies or AIDS Oh, okay, I see
AIDS and Baby Free, I get it.
So there's, I guess, the positives of playing this game.
Unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had, in which case you could probably, yeah.
You might be able to get genital herpes.
Herpes maybe.
Using the proper attachments.
All right, well, please, let's change the topic real quick here and talk about Castlevania.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura.com
And then there's another button where your thumb is.
So apparently, and that thumb button is used for items later in the game, you stand in a designated spot, you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game.
I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things.
And then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out and they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them.
So that's kind of neat.
And then of course the weapons like knives, they do take hearts just like the game.
That's like 25 hearts.
So it sounds like a shooting game with a Castlevania twist on it.
So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii.
Possibly.
There's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii.
Rumors.
I think that there's more than one way to do it too.
It doesn't necessarily have to be Wii only.
This sounds neat in theory, though.
It does.
That sounds pretty cool.
Speaking of Silent Hill, I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now.
I know Comcast is nationwide.
I don't know if their On Demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the On Demand and HD for free on Comcast On Demand.
So I actually watched it this weekend with William.
Well, he'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all.
He needed me to explain it to him.
So we watched it, and I did.
But I'll tell you what.
Silent Hill and HD, very, very hot.
is a very good looking movie.
I still like Silent Hill as a movie and I hope the rumors of the sequel are true.
I hope so too.
Well, how about some release dates, Rob?
How about it?
Well, for the 30th in the UK, we have Double D Dodgeball on Xbox 360 and Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 on Xbox 360.
On the first, though, is a whole crap ton of stuff.
Brothers in Arms, Hell's Highway, Ferrari Challenge, that's on Wii, by the way, Flat Out Ultimate Carnage on PC, Hellboy, The Science of Evil for PS3,
SBK08 Superbike World Championship on some systems and Soul Calibur 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Cool.
Sounds pretty hot.
In the U.S.,
We have a few things coming out this week.
Soul Calibur 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
Spectral Force 3 on the 360 from Atlus.
Summer Athletics on PlayStation 2, Wii, and Xbox 360, your generic Summer Olympics game.
Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI City Life 2008 Edition SNK Arcade Classics Vol.
1 MLB Power Pros 2008
Everlight on the PC, Art of Murder FBI Confidential on PC, Deadliest Catch Alaskan Storm on PC, and let's see here, also in the US this week, we've got Beijing 2008 on the PC, and Baseball Mogul 2009 on PC, and Legend in the Hand of God on PC.
Lots of PC games this week.
Soul Calibur IV Soul Calibur IV
Beijing Olympics 2008, also coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan.
Going over to the PlayStation 3.
They're also getting Soul Calibur 4, of course, on the 31st.
And they are also getting the Special Fighting Stick as well.
And if you want Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PlayStation 3, guess what?
Here you go.
It's coming out in Japan this week.
Now, going over to the Nintendo Wii.
Not a lot of games I've heard of before, but they do have it.
Dokopan Kingdom for Wii is coming out on...
The 31st, as well as We de Tokotan Kanji Nu is coming out as well.
And Zero Geshu no Kamen comes out as well this week.
And that game looks to be like a little bit of a survivor horror type game.
So this game actually looks kind of cool.
Kind of looking at some of the CG from the game.
It's like crazy.
Fatal Frame 4.
Is that what this is?
Yeah.
Ah, it's their version of Fatal Frame 4.
We de Tokuton Kanji no Looks like...
I think it's like a... It looks like one of those 200... 250 games in a game type thing.
Looks a little weird.
Alright, probably not so many people going over that.
Other systems.
Let's go to the handheld systems and see what's coming out in Japan.
I'm sorry, first, PlayStation 2.
Drastic Killer comes out this week.
Galaxy Angel 2.
Gino Express.
Hoshifuru.
Kano-Kan Isui all come out this week on the PlayStation 2.
Going over to the handhelds and looking at what's coming out there...
Dream Baseball Doki Doki Majo Shinpan 2 Witch Hunting
Wow.
They actually made a sequel to that.
Look at that.
The top screen is her face and the bottom screen is her boobies on the DS there.
That's Doki Doki Majo Shinpan 2.
All in the name of fighting witches.
Yes.
Also coming out, Rhythm Tenku Gold comes out this week on the DS.
Steel Princess, Tozoku Ojo, Windy Cross Windom comes out as well.
Lots and lots of DS releases this week.
PSP.
Looking at those releases.
A little bit going on over there as well.
Phantasy Star Portable being the most notable of the releases in Japan this week.
Panic Palette Portable and Ginga Ojosoma Denutsu Collection.
Ojosoma?
Yeah, it's the PC Engine Best Collection.
It's Princess something.
It's a PC Engine Best Collection.
It's three PC Engine games.
I'm not sure what games they are.
That looks familiar.
I just don't know what that is.
They're...
That looks so familiar.
Yeah, it looks very familiar.
There's something, I don't know if it's come out or coming out, though, that I want from overseas.
Hmm, what's that?
That's the Fantasy Zone collection.
I think we've covered it before.
They're shooters, just so you know.
Yeah.
That's really familiar.
I probably have a couple of them.
All right, well, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.
Busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan.
Well, speaking of other busy events, is that there has been a little, I guess, controversy regarding a lack of Halo information, from what I understand, at E3.
but they actually were saying that Halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote, big enough at this point that it can stand on its own so there are a few hints going around they've mentioned Comic Con and other conventions that there might be a HaloCon in fact, let me see if I can't get this name
just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy well but it was I guess one of the higher ups saying that you can do a HaloCon nothing on the scale of Comic Con but you could bring a few hundred people to see a Halo thing if there were a Microsoft and Bungie endorsed Halo tournament Uber thing I bet people would come it depends where they have it Rob, I'd go
Well, it would depend on where they'd have it.
I'd go.
You know what I mean?
I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it.
But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive.
Maybe even L.A.
Heck yeah.
Who knows?
Well, HaloCon, possibly coming soon.
I see they kidnapped the press to bring them to that.
You know, scare the crap out of them.
That would be fun.
I want someone to cosplay Master Chief.
You'd think there'd be Master Chief cosplay at HaloCon, I would hope.
And Cortana and all your favorite Halo characters.
And people dress up like Star Wars characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is.
I don't know why.
Thanks for watching!
and DarkSakura.
Actually, I heard another interesting rumor.
Three is awesome.
I think you're thinking the same thing I am.
What did you hear?
I heard the rumor that the games that are cross-platform enabled, like Shadowrun and... I want to say there was another one, Lost Planet.
Those, if you have an Xbox 360 version of, you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now.
And that may lead the way to more...
things.
Possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox.
That could be very interesting.
We'll see.
Is it because it's probably just competition from things like Steam and other products that exist, you know, out there.
All these kind of competing portals for games on PC, so to speak.
It's Lost Planet Colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform.
According to Actdeft in chat.
I like free, so that's pretty cool, except I don't really play Halo on the computer.
Same thing, the silver accounts on Xbox Live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit.
Mega Man 9 Box Art T-Shirts
and it is the same classic cheesy box art with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art it's like someone at Capcom got the joke in other words well they're actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon
Awesome.
Did you see the other one that they put out?
Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other... Meatbun.com, I think was what it was.
It was the 1942 pin-up girl thing with Cammy.
That shirt?
Oh, I saw that.
Not as funny.
I ordered one.
You would.
That was the other game I played on Xbox Live this week.
I didn't even talk about it.
1942.
Now that's how you remake a retro game for Xbox Live.
That's all I have to say.
I only played the demo, but I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port I have in a long time.
Other than maybe Pac-Man Championship Edition.
So, just check that out if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases.
Because 1942 was pretty awesome, I gotta say.
I like the 1942 Kai.
That was a good one.
But I want to see the 1940XX ones remade.
Wouldn't that be cool?
That would be really sweet.
But going back to the whole retro side of things, there's a hint that Igarashi is planning on doing a new Castlevania in 2D for Wii on WiiWare.
That's going to be pretty cool.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the Castlevania series.
So he says that he's going to pay attention to how Mega Man 9 is with the market and base his decision on that.
So that's smart.
I like this trend Mega Man 9 seems to be starting.
Yeah?
This could be very good.
I think it's like, you know... It could also be very bad.
We love our 2D, but no one wants to really admit it in the 3D market until someone just says, ah, screw it, we're doing it anyway.
And they're like, hey, they're making money on this.
It's safe.
For very little money into it, you know what I mean?
So let's do it!
I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it.
I just don't understand why they don't...
Thanks for watching!
Could we make money too?
Could retro goodness be a money making machine?
Now the problem, hopefully the pool doesn't get diluted.
Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything.
I don't know.
I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means they actually have to work on it.
Versus I don't know, just like porting something from like PlayStation 2 or the GameCube.
True.
This is something that's pretty exciting, and I don't know why I'm excited about it since I, up until a couple weeks ago, didn't know what the hell The Watchmen was.
I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it.
Although I am interested in reading it now.
But anyways, at Comic-Con they announced that they're going to be making...
Watchmen Episodic Games on the PC, PS3, and the 360
and they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storylines so that's kind of cool and they showed off some footage of it and the first kind of level that they showed off was with Night Owl and Rorschach and it was kind of
Thanks for watching!
Looks good.
Can't wait to see it.
TigerClaw in our chat room wanted to point out, Loki, Warner Brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of The Watchmen on iTunes.
The first chapter is free.
Cool.
So if you're into The Watchmen, this is a very happy period of time for you.
Also a very happy period of time for Geometry Wars fans Because Geometry Wars 2 is coming And guess what?
Unlike most Xbox Live Arcade news we usually have It's coming earlier than anticipated That's great news It's coming this week, July 30th is the big day for Geometry Wars 2 The bad news...
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
None of the multiplayer is online anyways because with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online.
That's true.
Bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on Xbox Live for the new Geometry Wars.
Yes, there is.
I downloaded it and checked it out.
It looks pretty neat.
I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat.
The graphics have this kind of adjusted...
I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what, but I have a feeling this might be the final product.
This adjusted soft tone to them that makes it look like an old Vectrex game or something.
It looks like they put Vaseline on the camera lens.
But it sounds better than Loki's describing it.
It gives it a real soft look to it that gives it an old 80s game flair.
So it's kind of cool.
I like that.
Alright.
Wouldn't that be awesome to have Geometry Wars on a Vectrex?
Like someone to do a homebrew game?
You never know.
People are pretty crazy.
Alright, this is now the part of the show where we're going to take a quick break.
But not until we get to the classic game of the week.
Because we always, before the break, like to talk a little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness.
Which, how appropriate, following a story about Geometry Wars 2, which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming.
DarkSakura is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out.
And this week's title...
DarkSakura.com
The classic game of the week is a game that was on the Neo Geo systems put out by Saurus is the developer.
It's called Shock Troopers.
Shock Troopers is really freaking awesome.
Um, basically, imagine how, like, a plane shooter game would be, except you're running on the ground, and that's what you've got.
Um, you, um, basically you can, uh, fire your guns in, uh, eight directions, you can strafe, you can, um...
If you attack point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and extra life, things like that.
You actually have a dodge button, too.
There's a team battle mode where you can pick different soldiers in the game and everything.
And actually, one of the cool things about this is that it was actually... From what I understand, it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to Metal Slug.
So that's actually pretty cool, even though it completely is in a different...
I want to play this game as Big Mama.
That sounds awesome.
As you go through the game, you can actually pick a different path, the jungle, mountain, or valley, and you can switch to a different route or continue on the same.
So it's basically sort of a running gun sort of game.
Cool, the guy has a flamethrower right now.
Looks like Ikari Warriors.
Yeah, it looks like Ikari Warriors.
Yeah, it is a lot like Ikari Warriors.
A lot more souped up.
and there's also one called Shock Trooper Second Squad that's supposed to be standalone, no connection, and you can only choose four characters and it has no team mode.
It's also a little bit more cartoony and the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them because it's actually, well, it's completely 2D, the 3D graphics are pre-rendered, so...
There's actually a release on PlayStation 2 and PSP.
So that's pretty cool.
It was actually, we got it in North America through the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.
And now you can get it on the Wii, too.
That just came out.
Really?
Yeah, SNK Arcade Classics.
Oh, I thought you meant on Virtual Console.
I'm like, really?
I don't remember.
Okay, cool.
I like the music in it, too.
It's very, you know... Let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear it.
It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it.
Cool, huh?
Yeah, pretty cool.
So there it is, your classic game of the week, Shock Troopers for the Neo Geo.
Pretty awesome.
I think it was just the Neo Geo arcade systems.
Well, you know, close enough.
No, I take that back.
It did come out on the AVS.
I was going to say, couldn't you get just about any arcade game?
It did come out on the AVS.
Is it a hard to find one?
I don't think so.
I just had forgotten about it.
That's alright.
Alright, so there you have it, Shock Troopers, your classic game of the week, and we are going to take a quick break, but we will be back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
Again, we are, this is probably the last time I'll remind you guys, we are one big show now, so if you're listening on the podcast, just stay tuned, and we're going to take a free break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
For those listening live, we've got some music coming your way.
We'll be back.
Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.
Recently, I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.
Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.
It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day, you still have an incredibly small penis.
Gaming Radio.
So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 27th, 2008.
For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat.orangeloungeradio
All right, we're halfway there.
We've got plenty more news to cover tonight.
Let's get right into it.
Loki, start us off.
If you can put down your DS for five minutes, come back to the show.
I'm sorry, am I interrupting something, Loki?
I was just playing Core 10 DS.
There are rumors via leaked pictures of a PSP case.
saying that the PSP-3000 is in works right now.
In fact, this supposedly leaked picture is of one of the designs that they, I don't know, didn't go with.
Some of the features on this design, which may reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final PSP-3000 design, includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a PlayStation button, much like on the PSP-3000.
PS3, Sixaxis, or DualShock 3 controllers.
So, I'm not too surprised by that.
That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet, because there may be a whole other PSP coming out.
And I'm sure this one will be completely unhackable.
Oh yeah, because Sony prevented that now.
They said, we're putting stuff to this right now.
That's right.
It's only taken us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it.
Absolutely.
No more.
Well, what do you think?
Is it time for the PSP to get a remodel, or is it too soon?
Will it drive sales?
I don't think it's going to drive sales.
It might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone.
It may allow them to do more things with it, depending on what features they add to it.
With a built-in microphone, you can play crappy karaoke games, you can do the stupid stuff that they do with the DS, where you can blow into the microphone to do things.
I don't know.
Might be kind of cool to do really crappy Skype without using a headset with it.
I guess that's true.
Voice over IP, possibly.
You could do some side talking.
So, Sony fans, next time someone tries to tell you the PSP blows, you can say, yes, it does.
Right?
Or you blow on the PSP.
You blow the PSP.
You can go blow the PSP.

The Feminist Gamers
Great displeasure to Sony.
In Shakespeare, they said, quote, Congrats on your awesome new game, Sony.
I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating, heteronormative assholes.
And then Feminist Gamer...
Quote, instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with, why not go out and find gold to stuff into a treasure chest?
The more gold in the chest, the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry.
So obviously some women groups are getting very upset.
Now Titan Studios, the art director there, has actually came out and commented on the whole situation after this.
He actually said, does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look, characters, and everything is a girl?
How about they all just shut up and get over it?
Learn to be offended people.
It's not, you know, if people got their, you know, less of a stick up their ass about certain things, I think the world would be a whole lot nicer, don't you?
And notice how the game is called Fat Princess.
It's not saying, like, all women are fat.
I mean, if they put out a game called that, I can see where people might get a little bit offended.
But it's just a princess who happens to be fat.
But let us remember the Mika song.
Big girl, you are beautiful.
What's wrong with, you know, this?
This is just... It's innocent.
I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this.
You know what I mean?
So...
I'm Curious Chat Fat Princess Gets No Love Because She's Fat Fat Kirby
I see Kirby's pretty fat.
How about this?
How about lose any sort of social, you know, the only reason that I think that there's such a bad social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it.
It's like, why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop being so fucking offended?
If you don't have a problem with weight, then don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.
Don't get offended for people!
Why don't they just call the game, I Like Cake?
Perfect!
Okay!
Because seriously, if cake offends somebody, then there's just no pleasing you.
Right?
I like cake.
I like cake.
A lot.
I mean, seriously, look at me.
Alright, can we move on, please, before Loki offends me?
Well, guess what?
Operation Ground and Pound Revolution Death Squad
They're going to be 500 Microsoft points for those three.
Sounds like a good time.
Hell yeah.
I like Dragon Force.
Good stuff.
I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck.
Well, one thing not coming to the PlayStation Network anytime soon is Wipeout HD.
Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests.
The game is so hardcore it makes people have seizures.
Now that's offensive.
Yeah, apparently, I guess it's, according to computers and video games, Wipeout HD's delay is because a little bit more technical features, it's extra features, and apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy test.
Can you imagine what would happen if Sony had neglected to do that?
Like how much poop they'd be in?
In the general populace, if they had just forgot to make that kind of testing, and all these kids everywhere were having seizures because of a video game, oh my god.
I guess it's a good thing they go through all these strict tests before a video game is released, huh?
Yeah.
In a way.
It's a good thing they have all those seizure warnings on manuals and stuff.
That's true, too.
Anyhow, the Dark Knight.
Have you seen the Dark Knight movie?
Yeah.
Kind of neat?
No, and I'm not going to.
You're not?
I've decided I don't want to see it.
Why not?
It wasn't bad.
It was long.
I've decided I don't want to see it.
All right.
Well, your choice.
Movies are expensive these days.
It's $10 to go see a movie.
Well, they are making a video game based on the Dark Knight.
I'm surprised.
Yeah, I know, big surprise, that's not news, right?
But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps.
It was actually Gary Oldman in an interview kind of spilled the beans that the game was coming out, and it caused this whole little controversy where a video was out, and then it was pulled, and now it's out again, and all this other dumb stuff going on.
Not to mention that it was also leaked by IGN before that.
Well, I mean, seriously, duh, there's going to be a Dark Knight game.
Duh, duh, duh.
They've been making Batman games ever since the old NES Batman game, which was actually pretty rad.
The old Batman game was awesome.
The old Batman game was awesome.
Batman Returns, less awesome, but the original Batman game was pretty awesome.
And there's even Lego Batman and all this crap, anyway.
But The Dark Knight, kind of funny enough, it was not there at E3, but it is still coming out, and I'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the Blu-ray release of the movie and DVD release of the movie, which will be in time for Christmas, I imagine.
Gary Oldman is quoted in the video saying, quote, it's hard to make a movie like this under the radar.
Dark Knight The Game Joy
Anyway, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because I'm sick of hearing about it.
That's why I don't want to see it.
What?
I was going to say, it doesn't make it any worse of a movie though.
But I understand.
Hype machine sometimes kills things.
And we'll kind of like, you know, if you hear all this hype, this hype, this hype about something and you watch it and you go, it's good but it's not great.
And that's what a lot of people are saying about Batman.
It's good but it's not that great of all this hype.
I didn't really care about seeing the last one either.
I just saw it at home.
I agree with my husband.
I won't see one until I get a Two-Face-only movie.
I don't want to say anything because it's a spoiler.
I already know.
I'm just going to back up for that.
But I will say this.
I already know.
I also paid $10 to see Mamma Mia this week.
Now that I would see.
And I'm going to see X-Files as soon as I get a chance.
I will only see Mamma Mia again.
I'm sorry.
I heard the X-Files movie's not hot.
I really don't... It's fan service, though.
If you watch the show, you'll probably like it.
Stay through the credits.
You don't want to miss that one.
My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it, so I'm going to just see it for myself.
Fair enough.
I won't see Mamma Mia again, though, until they let the audience sing along with the movie.
Well, how about the new Dexter game that's coming out for iPhones?
Do you remember us talking about that before?
Actually, Mark Echo, who does that clothing line and does graffiti, is actually supposed to be working with it, I do believe.
And
his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an episodic content and as far as I know I do believe that Dexter is a show about a serial killer who is a splatter analysis for the Miami Police Department so it's a very interesting premise and I think the game has a good promise
He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to.
So he kills serial killers.
That's extra special.
It's on Showtime, which means it can be on movies.
Which means I won't watch it.
I think they've run it on CBS a couple times during the writer's strike and stuff when they needed programming.
But it sounds like it could be an interesting game.
Interesting.
Keyword.
I'd just like to see what episodic content they're thinking of.
And the fact it's on the iPhone, of all things.
It's interesting.
We'll see how it turns out, I guess.
Tap here to murder.
Gold Banjo in chat says, I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome.
I heard a lot of people like it.
I just, since I don't have show time, I don't really watch it.
Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to comment.
Well, last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that Grand Theft Auto 4 was coming out on the PC.
Well, now there's even more confirmation of this.
First, starting off with the PC Gamer Magazine from Malaysia.
Yeah, I know that's not exactly in the US or UK or whatever, but
Hey, it's on the cover, so that's got to say something, right?
So they had a big little article about that.
Also, there was a posting which is now removed on the ESRB website.
Apparently, no one got the memo over at ESRB.
Yes, that is entirely accurate.
Um...
So yeah, I'm sure it will be coming to PC.
It's not a surprise.
All the last few have, so it makes sense.
And this means hello hacking.
That's what I'm most interested in, is all the mods for it.
That would be awesome.
Reskinning.
Let's make predictions.
How many days before Grand Theft Auto 4 PC has a topless mod?
Meaning all the women walk around topless.
10.
10?
I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves.
Like, it'll get pirated before the game's even out, and somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out.
There you have it.
Alright, well, also coming out, and another port that's highly anticipated, although of a completely different type, it's the game Peggle, the PopCap game that's kind of like Plinko on Crack.
I don't know if you've played this game.
I really enjoy it on the iPod, and I bet there'll be a lot of DS people who like this game as well.
Um...
Thanks for watching!
and you'll have a good idea what to expect on the DS later this year and it's fun you know for a casual game it's a lot of fun it's stupidly simple you just fire a ball down the little you know playing field it's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although you know pinball has ramps and you know other things that Peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat I enjoy Peggle it's a great iPod game it's almost made for the iPod
Alright, this is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us.
It's a little segment we have here on the show called the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in.
So let's open up ye olde mailbag and DarkSakura, take it away.

First email comes from AZHP.
Hey, LLR crew.
With all the talk about F-Zero GX being one of the greatest racers on last week's show and eager anticipation of a Wii title being announced, I figured I'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately Miyamoto went on record saying he was extremely disappointed in how Sega approached F-Zero GX slash AX and that if F-Zero were to be made for another console, it would not be in the same style as GX.
This is probably because it was too difficult, hard, confusing, but in my opinion it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos that came with playing the game, even at the rookie difficulty levels.
The game was critically acclaimed as well and received higher than 8 over 10 for most game reviewers.
I, for one, love, love, loved F-Zero GX, and am more than excited at the thought of another F-Zero game, especially in HD, but unfortunately it probably will never come to pass.
Let's hope Miyamoto comes to his senses and greenlights this game, because honestly, how could anyone not like that game, aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something.
Keep up the great work, and P.S., I went to Disneyland for the first time in about 15 years, and I now realize why you guys trip down there so often.
It really is a place where dreams come true.
I haven't been in like a year.
I don't have my pass anymore.
But yeah, F-Zero, I mean, I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because they don't think it'll work.
They'll think of some stupid Wii feature to implement in it that'll make it worthwhile.
At least I hope.
I really hope.
Because you're right, it's critically acclaimed and gamers that bought it loved it.
I hope they do it.
I hope a miracle pulls through.
I'm not going to hold my breath, but it would just be great.
How about Miyamoto realized that maybe they should actually give gamers what they want?
Wasn't there actually a DSF-0 after AXGX?
I don't remember.
I thought there was.
I could be wrong.
It might have been before, but I seem to remember there was one after.
Well, next email.
Hi, OLR.
And this comes from Ritual Insomnia.
Actually, J-Rod, sorry.
Oops, sorry.
First off, I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones.
I work 10-hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on Fridays.
So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make Mondays easier.
I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make.
You guys had your E3 wrap-up show, which was great, but failed to even mention a huge title, Gears of War 2.
I'm absolutely stoked for this game, and you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at Microsoft's keynote.
I actually didn't think about it, sorry.
This puts me in a position.
I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not.
Well, you can't get to the ferret, so you can't.
I mean, you did make up for it by having a discussion about the new game, Silent Hill...
Okay, you used game a bunch of times.
Homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb-stomping sequel.
How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support?
Marcus says Chainsaw, Dahlia Gillespie says for me to be nice.
I don't know what to do with you people.
This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads and Breadsticks.
Now stop ripping off my signature fools.
Dude, seriously.
It's not like I forgot about Gears of War 2.
I did not forget about Gears of War 2.
This is a lot of news.
I just didn't care.
I honestly didn't fucking care.
I hated Gears of War 1 and Gears of War 2.
Guess what?
I'm not buying it.
And to be honest, there's enough news out there.
Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of Gears of War 2?
No, I don't need to because guess what?
We didn't talk about every single demo that they had there.
I mean, seriously.
Gears of War 2 wasn't really at E3, it was just at the keynote.
Gears of War 2 will be playable at PAX Half of Microsoft's booth will be Gears 2
Gears of War 2
Next email.
Good Sunday evening to you, OLR.
I trust that everyone's been having a nice week so far.
Anyways, I'd like to say I'm kind of slow in catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my iPod anymore.
I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go, and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for OLR.
Since the newer episodes are 70 megabytes now, I'm struggling to make ends meet on my iPod.
Very nice format, though.
When I heard the news about Final Fantasy XIII being a 360 release as well, I tried thinking of PS3 exclusives.
While the first-party fare has been from decent Motorstorm to the best games I've ever played, Metal Gear Solid 4, I've yet to see many good third-party games.
Haze doesn't count.
What I'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the PS3 by releasing original, innovative games, not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for DLC ports.
Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off?
Or is it the fact that more people own 360s?
But I first can't wait for the Naruto PS3 game coming out in October though.
One last thing, with the addition of Butterfly and WW and DDRX, I think that Konami has gone too far in reminiscing.
I mean, sure, those are a couple of the best songs DDR has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated.
The additions are like a slutty girlfriend.
She may be nice and all, but who hasn't done her?
That's funny.
I mean, any DDR player has played Butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right?
Why add it in a console version now?
Well, that's all I have to say for the past few weeks, and E3, while disappointing for some, did have some very high points.
Until next time, Katamari's forever.
This message brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending American IP addresses.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy.
You know, obviously, there's always going to be people who love the idea and some people who don't like the idea.
I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your iPod to make it work.
I hope, one way or another.
So, that's all I have to say.
The rest of it, you know, good thoughts.
That's it.
Okay.
Greetings, everyone.
I'm here live from the laundromat showing some heart.
Are you at the laundromat right now?
No, yeah, well, no, look at the time.
Before I begin, there's a few things I'd like to say.
To DarkSakura, I've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit.
I truly loved and enjoyed everything.
Words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality.
When you come to NYC, I will give that back to you a thousandfold.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Thank you.
To Rob, I wish we had more time to hang out, not enough.
Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago, and FYI, part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show.
As I said before, when you come to New York City, I will give that back to you a thousandfold because you're so fabulous.
To Loki, you're all right in my book.
Too bad we didn't get a chance to talk more and be more chill.
You were supposed to come join me and Jamie for lunch.
I did call you a couple times.
I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay.
When you come out here to New York City, I will show you a damn good time.
Now on to some other things.
Oh wow, this is a long email, sorry.
I have said in the past that it would not surprise me that Square Enix would put Final Fantasy XII on Xbox 360.
Thank you, Square Enix, for saving my roommate $400 on a paperweight.
I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason I feel that Konami will put Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360 I'm not saying that because I'm a drooling fanboy but from a financial point of view the money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the PS3 due to the fact that it has a lower consumer home base and then the 360 that was the point actually I agree with
Putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles.
And speaking of Konami, people are calling for others to not support Konami as a sad reality.
I understand where you're coming from about this, though.
The whole lawsuit with Konami vs. Viacom is not Konami's fault.
You have to blame Activision about this because they're the ones paying licensee fees to them for Guitar Hero.
Everyone is saying that Konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides Bemani.
Konami has other titles such as Will Castlevania, Contra Metal Gear Solid, to name a few.
Also, Konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list.
I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it.
I like the gameplay screens, and what annoys me more is that the Bimani fanboys girls are going to foam at the mouth because of no Guitar Freaks Drum Mania tracks in the game.
If Konami added a lot of those tracks, they would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game.
That's my two cents on it.
Anywho, keep up the good work and don't stop believing.
This email was brought to you by Joey Pisano's on Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy, home of the 5.95 lunch specials.
You'll love Pisano's.
And also by Anime Jam Sessions, the newest anime cosplay podcast.
Cheap plug.
Yep.
Um... Yeah, uh...
I like what Black Wolf is saying in chat right now.
I'm just reading.
Does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see?
Because that's one of the symbols.
No, I don't agree with him that if you put some Bumai tracks in there that alienate, you know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
A mainstream artist that everybody would love, I mean, because some people find them annoying, like me.
And so some of the Guitar Hero tracks, or Guitar Freaks tracks, could easily be unlockable songs in that.
But, no, that would be, you know, trying to even incorporate their old audience into it, oh, well that...
That would be awful.
I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game whereas the other people may not buy your game.
So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already to buy that game.
On the other topic, I agree with his reasoning for the Final Fantasy XIII on the Xbox 360.
It just makes sense that they want to make sure they get all the development costs back by making sure they get a good share of the U.S.
marketplace.
Although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a PlayStation 3 just to get it for Final Fantasy XIII, myself being one of them.
But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it.
So, there you have it.
Any more emails tonight?
One.
One more.
Hey, LLR!
Hi.
I've been thinking about starting to play World of Warcraft, but the $15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget.
I would like everyone's opinion on whether or not it is worth the fee.
Is Guild Wars or another MMORPG without a fee a viable alternative?
I heard that there are free private servers for World of Warcraft as well.
Are these legitimate?
No.
Thank you for your time.
Keep on keeping on, Seth.
Um...
I honestly World of Warcraft I got very burned on it very quickly I suggest if you can find like a trial try out a trial of it you know see how you like it but Guild Wars I think will be better for your money if you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free Ragnarok online server
I agree, though, that Guild Wars is a viable alternative to World of Warcraft.
I mean, it's different.
You can't say they're the same game, because they're not.
At a glance, they look the same, and even when you're first playing them, you're like, oh, there's a lot of similarities.
But kind of the way the endgame works is much different.
I mean, Guild Wars is really about guilds warring in the final endstages.
There's only 20 levels in the game, after all.
And you can download the client online.
Very, very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game.
I actually sort of had the thought of giving it one more go myself.
I mean, I got really annoyed with it, but I figured if I... And this is what I always do, is that I play for a couple months and quit again.
So, I guess with being in school, I'm not going to really have a whole lot of time to play.
But I was thinking of maybe giving it another go.
It got really boring.
Blood elves are hot.
They are.
But it got really boring.
Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time.
Yeah, it was.
Oh, I couldn't remember.
I had just upgraded.
Oh, wow, okay.
Because remember... That's right.
I remember.
I remember.
Yeah.
All right.
So that's it for the email then.
All right.
If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com is the place to send those emails.
For now, Loki's going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic.
Yes, how ironic, all of this.
Gears of War 2, there's some new things been announced about it, including that they're going to have some content for Gears of War 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from Gears of War 1.
And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had.
So that's kind of neat.
and also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for Halo 3 which will be the $130 Lancer bundle that will come with a Lancer yes a miniature replica model of a Lancer what game is this again?
Gears of War 2 I'm getting Gears of War 2 it's not the same kind of Lancer that you're thinking of it's a chainsaw gun I still want one
All right.
I like everything Lancer.
What about the whole achievements thing?
The whole achievements thing?
Yeah.
Yeah, I mentioned that.
Oh, sorry.
I spaced for a minute.
I don't know.
What do you think of it, though?
It's an achievement horror.
I think that's kind of cool.
I think it's something they should implement in other games.
It will get you to buy some of their older games, like Gears of War.
Especially for the achievement horror in all of this.
Exactly.
You make the announcement now.
They just released that Gears of War refresh.
Time to buy your copy of that for like $39.99.
And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff.
They used to do that kind of with Burnout, actually.
Remember Burnout 3 and stuff like that?
Burnout Revenge actually did this.
If you had a game save for Burnout 3, you got a car from Burnout 3.
And then also if you had a Madden save, you got the Madden van.
in Burnout.
I don't understand why they don't do this more often, but whatever.
Alright.
Cool, I like the idea.
But I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements.
But one game I am definitely considering buying is Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe because I actually like Mortal Kombat quite a bit.
And even though I'm not as huge into comic books as some other people, I think the DC Universe characters are pretty good.
And you know, tons of people have Joker fever right now because of the new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on.
Lots of people...
Jax and Katana Green Lantern Green Lantern
That could be pretty cool.
So there you have it.
Now the question is, since villains supposedly could have fatalities, even though heroes count because of the whole DC Comics rules, could the Joker kill people in the game?
I don't know.
I think even if they're fatalities, they're going to be really kind of softened down.
You're not going to see any head ripping.
Honestly, if it's the Joker, you don't know what he's going to do.
I think that if they give him fatalities, they either should or shouldn't go off at random.
Like if he pulled out a gun, it'd either blow their head off or punch him with a big fist or something.
Nice idea.
I like that.
Or say bang.
Because this is the Joker.
You don't know what he's going to do.
He does this to freak you out.
That's a good idea.
That would be very Joker.
And then, you know, you get like bang, bang, bang, you know, three things in a row.
And right when you think, oh, it's not going to happen, boom, headshot.
GameGuru hypothesizes that Joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room.
Zene in chat says Jax was booed when he first came up at the panel.
That's sad.
Jax is cool.
He has metal arms because he's got his own fatality done on him somehow.
Hmm.
I would like to say that I have some interesting news.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
And this makes me quite happy.
Although, I'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned, well, that we don't have in show role, but ties into this, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago.
There is actually a rumor stating, and this actually was going on at a
San Diego Comic Con 08 Marvel Studios President of Production was saying well they were actually asked if there would be another Marvel vs. Capcom and he said yes and maybe sooner than you think
So, but the other thing I've been reading is that when, and you know I've covered this on the show before, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which by the way, there's more stuff out, more characters in it, including Hurricane Polymer, Kashan, Gatchaman.
uh the robot one I can never remember the name of um Techaman for for anyone who's like and also Batsu's in it from rival schools um uh Morrigan um just a bunch of you know characters but going back to the the Marvel uh versus Capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um the current test machines being out in Japan for Tatsunoko versus Capcom that Marvel was sort of like uh we want to make money off of this again
AJ Mix wants to see some Power Stone characters.
Actually, from what I understand, they have it for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
And actually, if you give me a second, I'll get the character list for you real quick.
The actual full trailer for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is actually up on YouTube right now.
You can find it easy just looking up Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
But give me just a quick sec.
DC Comics, Marvel, DC Comics, DC Comics, DC Comics
Okay, so far I don't have the full list of everything.
Okay, here's what we have so far for the list of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom characters.
We have Owashi no Ken, who is a G1 for Gatchaman, Kashan from the Kashan anime, Techaman from Techaman the Space Knight, Yachaman number one from Yachaman, Hurricane Polymer,
and GoldLighton from Golden Warrior, GoldLighton.
And from Capcom, there's Ryu, Chun-Li, Batsu from Rival Schools, Alex from Street Fighter 3, Morgan from Darkstalkers, and Silky from Onimusha, Dawn of Dreams.
So it's actually on location test in Tokyo right now.
and hopefully, I've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more as far as an actual release date soon.
In fact, I'm pulling up another list here.
They're saying a December 2008 actual release window.
So that's fairly cool.
I hope they add more characters though.
I really do.
But the poster though seems to be pretty finalized, the one that they've got out now.
Alright.
I want Speed Racer as a hidden character.
That was a Tatsunoko production thing.
Lord Katsuhiro in chat says, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom could come to the US.
It just depends on who holds what license to which Tatsunoko anime.
Still is going to be a pain in the ass, though.
Either way.
You know what?
I'm going to import it no matter what.
Got to.
You love Gatchaman and all those other characters.
That news does not surprise me one bit.
Alright, well if you have been following Core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the PlayStation Network, you'll probably have figured out that if you have purchased the, I want to say the August version of Core, whatever one just came out, you'll actually be able to get into the Resistance 2 beta this September.
And
also there will be some other ways to get in besides that according to MyResistance.net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game and they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon but if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new Naruto game but you get into the Resistance beta huh
I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing that's been very popular lately.
You know, whatever happened to the good old fashions, you know, sign up for it or, you know, it doesn't go out to the public at all.
It's just friends and family, even that.
What are you talking about?
Pay for demos have been around for a long time.
Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation magazine to get your demo disc?
Doesn't mean I like it.
Doesn't mean I like it one bit.
Will you sign up for a core membership?
No, because it's the 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer.
I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested.
Well, then there you go.
Alright, well, I think we need to give out an award for stupidity.
Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that.
It's much easier this week.
It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC.
Congratulations, you're the winner of the Stupid Award this week.
Here's why.
It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle.
I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle as long as they use figures or sales or even history, for God's sake.
I don't care.
But here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war.
It's because her son said so.
Her 16-year-old son said so.
He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened.
He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed.
After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4, as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline, and the awesomeness of Blu-ray, he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in.
As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you with a PlayStation.
Neither did I, he replied.
Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that, that he kept on top of all the...
I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out.
I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion.
I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact.
I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war.
I don't know.
Either way, it's retarded.
And this, yeah, shouldn't be reported on CNBC.
It's Financial Investor Network.
That's the problem I have with it.
And the whole thing sounds like a big old I-wanted-PSP-for-Christmas thing.
Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next.
I would like to say F you to whatever
Well, whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition, my grandmom is in the hospital right now.
It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that.
I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her.
And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, and other people... And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on, so...
Logi!
Um, I feed the people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people.
Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use?
And I'm like, no.
I don't own a cell phone at all.
Get the fuck off.
That's it.
F you to that
Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news.
DarkSakura, what you got for us?
Come next.
Oh, just some stuff.
Cool, I like stuff.
Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked?
Mm-hmm.
Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock Remixes are actually going to be, and this is just going to give me a second because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze, but some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
At least as far as I can see on here.
So I think that's pretty cool.
They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on the remixes.
DJ Pretzel.
We've actually had a few of the stuff on here.
Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley.
I guess I don't see a nickname for him.
But I think that's pretty cool.
They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the...
I agree, that is pretty cool.
Kudos to Capcom.
You're doing a lot of stuff right this year.
Good for you.
They figured it out.
Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon.
You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month.
Oh, well.
Well, now, what if it's Nintendo holding on to it?
What if it's Nintendo's fault?
Oh, wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault.
That's just lies.
That's what I thought.
But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.
And players, of course, will be able to control both animated characters, and hilarity will ensue from there.
No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series.
So that's kind of neat.
Episodic Gaming's The Wave of the Future
Maybe you're a Scrabulous player, but the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally.
Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game.
Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January.
So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on Scrabulous.
Facebook, Pogo, iPod, iPhone
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura
The Skype line is now open for business.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, it's Lord Katsuhito.
Is it now?
Wait, you changed your name tonight?
Are you referring to that in the Geni sense?
Maybe.
Do not start singing the Bo-Grom song.
So, Ranma, you already had an email read tonight.
This phone call better be good.
What's up?
I want to talk about Fat Princess.
I want to discuss this game.
Please do.
That alone makes me want to drop the $400 for a PlayStation 3.
Really?
Why?
The game looks fun.
I'm sorry.
It looks fun.
I've spent money on frivolous things, but that would be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game.
And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up.
I mean, really.
Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure.
Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360.
Not the sole reason, but a big reason.
I would say Xbox Live in general was.
It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way.
Sure, go for it.
I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times.
Why not?
Why not?
Everyone, get over it!
I'm never going to stop playing games.
But it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like twos.
And I'll still play Fat Princess.
Alright, any other thoughts, Ranma?
Don't stop believing.
Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend.
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be.
Um...
Let's see.
Comments in chat.
GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games like Talim from Soul Calibur.
Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke.
Let it be.
You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it.
This offends me.
And then, bitch.
I don't like it.
This offends me.
Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easygoing and go with the goddamn flow?
I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things.
Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work.
That's a good thing.
You know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like.
You don't have to have a hissy.
Just say, I don't like this.
And then get over it.
You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something.
I don't know.
Some comments in chat.
SSJ100Matt says, Maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles.
Why do you think she wears that dress?
Shaoran, it's a slimming dress.
Shaoran says, We need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Nah, it's Legend of Zalkin.
Hey Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
Nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all.
Yesterday's what party?
Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, massive rock band, lots of booze.
I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party?
Because you don't have a party without rock band.
Alright, then it officially was a party.
Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band.
And I left after an hour and a half.
But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia.
And that got me to stay as long as I did.
Because lumpia, good stuff.
Anyway, sorry, Zaku.
I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food.
What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight?
Well, let me see.
I'm trying to think right now.
The fact of the matter that Street Fighter 4 and the state of the arcades in this country, the fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machines.
But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore.
Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami and, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too.
I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven?
And DDR, of course, are they a little more forgiven?
Well, that's DDR.
That's an exception.
You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades and then all of a sudden, you know,
especially in America.
You know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved.
I would say, true statement, because Street Fighter 2, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades.
It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo.
It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge.
15 years ago, even.
And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, making efforts to, like, help
Instead of just beating around the bush and saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only.
How come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades?
I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades.
I wonder why not.
Well, think about it.
It's a risk.
You see the current state of the economy right now and how gas is ridiculously expensive.
People are trying to save as much money as possible.
So...
The first thing to go in tough times like these is entertainment.
I guess I can see that.
And the fact that the consoles have pretty much given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out.
Because they're outdoing the graphics.
I guess I can see that.
Well, I don't know.
What do you think the answer is?
When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever?
What's it going to take?
It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
That's a good saying.
It's effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games, Capcom, Konami, you know, the others.
They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades.
The ones that are struggling just to get by.
At least help them out a little bit.
Alright, Zaku, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
Um, let me see, yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it, it's done, it's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference.
I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it here in studio.
I know, it's like old news.
I'm thinking of that.
I should have brought it yesterday.
It's alright.
Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse.
It's alright.
Just to remind it it's dead.
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.
Have a good one, buddy.
Bye.
Later.
It's New York night on the Skype line.
That was two New Yorkers in a row.
Yep.
I haven't been to New York in a while.
It's been at least a year.
It's time for me to go back.
It's been about 12 years for me.
You need to go.
We need to storm the big city.
Be fun.
Literally storm through it.
As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it.
We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there.
We'll see.
Someday.
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon.
But first, some more calls.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's GS68, and I just broke the streak of New York gamers.
You're not from New York.
No, what's up?
Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it.
One way to do that would be to lower game prices, because these days, what typical gamer would pay more than $0.25 or $0.50 to play an arcade game?
Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much, but isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive?
I suppose, I mean, as much in... I hate to bring up Initial D again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs.
I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know?
But then everybody would know it's a budget cab, and people would go, this one's lame, it's not as good as the other one.
You know what an awesome cab was?
It was F-Zero AX.
That was a brilliant cabinet.
That was so fun.
Yeah, but look at Time Crisis 4.
The majority of the cab...
I don't know.
Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom?
And then
What else?
I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games, like in the 70s and 80s.
Nowadays, it's the other way around.
I mean, can you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that?
You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face.
A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else.
That would be something.
Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down.
I suppose.
Alright, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go?
Um, no.
I have news here about a guy who marathoned like 26 hours and a half playing the drums on Rock Band.
He played rock band drums for 26 and a half hours.
Did his arm fall off?
Unfortunately, not.
Wow.
Was he playing on hard mode?
He was playing an expert.
He's actually from the Star Hero Farms.
He's a staff member there.
Huh.
What was the point?
Was it charity or what?
Just have fun, basically.
He did something for charity though.
It wasn't that, how do you say it, big, because he only got to like $200.
Well, still, charity's charity.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Go to Jamie's and in her big game archive, we'll pick games and every hour the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next.
But they're like obscure shit.
Like no Mario, no Zelda.
What the hell do you think I have in the vault?
We're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault is what we would play all marathon long.
Do you think people would be into that?
Yeah, that would be cool.
I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out.
I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you.
Yes, that too.
But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off.
We'll have to think about it.
Maybe for, I would say, if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend.
Maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something.
I don't know.
Just throwing ideas out there.
Some three-day weekend we'll have to see.
Though basically the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the chat on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh, cool, like sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh, man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band.
And it makes me kind of pissed because...
Even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure.
Playing Expert, all the songs, even the Download Continent, so...
It's like... I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and those types of... Whatever website ran stories on this and whatever.
My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror.
You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills.
No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band.
If you think you're any better than the guy playing Rock Band, guess what?
You're worse.
The end.
Indeed.
I agree with that.
There is no counter-argument to that.
You are worse than the guy playing Rock Band, which, you know what?
If it makes him happy, I think he... Play it for 48 hours next time.
I support it.
He did say that he may try in December to do that again with all the download content that is going to be released until then.
So that would be cool.
Very cool.
Alright, Actdeft, thank you so much for the call and party on with Rock Band.
Yeah, thanks.
Have a good one, buddy.
Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories.
DarkSakura, by chance, anything?
I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors and apparently there's even video now apparently
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Loki, anything for you?
I don't think I have really much of anything.
There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground that kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious.
Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake.
So that's kind of interesting.
Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2.
Talk about stunt casting.
Really, I just think they want someone with big tits on their cover, so...
I support that fully.
Let's see here.
Don't care.
Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st, and what's kind of cool about it is it'll have the character creator with it, and you can actually share those characters that you create online, and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September.
So that's kind of neat.
Let's see...
BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader, I'll just pay $60.
K, thanks.
Well, I'll pay $60, and then maybe the $10, and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with.
Just messing.
Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun.
But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio.
I will start tonight and my final thought is I want a snack.
I want snacky foods.
Yum.
Yogurt.
I want frozen yogurt.
That would be really good.
Oh my god, Rob.
That'd sound really good.
That's my final thought, too.
I want frozen yogurt.
Let's go get some.
We can't.
They all close at 9.
We'll screw them.
Let's go to the grocery store.
I do need to go to the grocery store, though.
Loki, your final thought.
I don't know.
I don't have anything.
All right.
Wow.
All our PSPs still being worked on.
I just have a lot of small things I have to finish.
But it is been working.
I've been working on it quite heavily, so.
Soon.
