{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Roto! Tonight, July 27th, 2008, will some Nintendo controllers soon be banned, is an official HaloCon in the near future, and a PC gaming service has gone free! Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio. We are that podcast on the internet, dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. Tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron. So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic Con. Happy, happy, happy. So what is this, they're making a new Tron? Yes. Just Tron 2, is all you need to be saying. And Jeff Bridges is in it. Yeah, I saw that in the trailer. And he looks evil. What was up with that trailer though, like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away. Yeah, but someone else went back in and tried to zoom in and clean it up and get it looking as good as possible, so you can actually see some more stuff in it. Are they that strict with cameras at Comic Con? I mean, I would think with millions of people. That's Disney's panel. Yeah. I would think that Disney would want to keep it Well you okay remember any at one of the last t3s that we went to when Kingdom Hearts 2 came out Mm-hmm Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed when a vista vista would hmm remember yeah, yeah Yeah, I remember that so I would use that as sort of a past precedent Yeah, but still what are they gonna do? There's like thousands of people at Comic Con You know what I mean especially in those panels as far as I can tell though this this cell phone video was the only thing That I've seen So interesting well whatever they're doing it works, but I've never been to Comic Con Maybe next year. I'm going next year the one and only me Glatov. You've probably heard on this show He was a comic-con. He was giving me calls pretty much every day He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face He's a jerk intensely Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while yeah kind of All right speaking of jerks say hello to tech master Loki Just kidding Hey, I'm doing fine. Were you just watching a little preview because I was reading up on it But you know I didn't know that they actually had filmed it of course you have to assume that Anything that says do not film someone's gonna film it so exactly exactly especially something is Widely anticipated is that yeah, so hey just think about it It'll make a great video game except then again. There was a Tron 2.0 stop anybody do very well I think there's they should go ahead and try again There's a better the freeware or share where a Light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while. It's really really good cool I remember surround on the Atari 2600 that was just light cycles well remember that Anyhow if you want to join us in our chat room We are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number 289 of our podcast damn world chat that orange launch radio comm is the place to be if you want to join in with the chat, and I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now and Some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy And all that stuff and some people are commenting about how during the previous show the Bobby Black Wolf show on all games radio Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was a Bobby Black Wolf show Some people in there commenting on that if you want to hear that you got to listen to Bobby show though He's available at all games calm Click on Bobby Black Wolf show Alright, let's get into um. How was your gaming week? We always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, so how was your gaming week Dark Sakura after the response who? Ronchon real quick sure he said he handed me he who shall not be named us still beating heart But that means you'd have to have a heart first Instead of a lump of coal nice like some like the evil Smurfette did All right so gaming week I played stuff actually I did finally start Aurora faint, and that gives freaking cool. I Don't know much about this game. Tell us a little bit about Aurora. It's an iPhone game. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, okay? That is It's it's sort of like how will be to help be jeweled does except you can only move them horizontally But you can sort of slide as as you destroy groups They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does when you you know but you can actually move blocks off to the side And and move them that way move them laterally into empty spaces So it's sort of a neat a neat thing and you can level up and learn new techniques and it's a very cool little game and and very pretty and shiny and I played This other thing called color spiral, but all it is is just Drawing really awful circles on the iPhone so it sucks, and I got a sudoku game just to try it I got it's just called sudoku free and it actually it's kind of neat really you know easy as in really easy as in But it's it's it's pretty the interface is pretty you can choose your color. I've done something similar I've had just this week I downloaded coffee time crosswords because I kind of felt obligated as it is a new Xbox Live arcade title to kind of look at it and My obligation dried up in about three minutes. I was just like this game is poopy well to answer an alpha Kynanogram The game was called aurora faint Fe int like a battle maneuver. It sounds a little like medios with the whole sideways only movement thing You'll have to give it a try. You'll have to get a try You can actually make a character on my phone if you want that's cool or one of these days I'll finally break down to buy an iPhone one of these days. I hear people are still lining up for that stuff. That's crazy but also um I I Downloaded something else. I actually think that I might though try uh I Was actually this was it. I was about to download miss pac-man and Apparently it's utter crap, so I didn't do it because The there's no real good way to control it um I can imagine They should do marble madness for iPhone though if they can do monkey ball They can do marble madness good time, but monkey ball sucks on iPhone. Just letting you know really yes, you have to um To play just right instead of holding your phone at a perfect um Flat angle you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position so it's really Not good Um I also I did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been because I've been doing a lot of homework I did though get some some fantastic nerd time yesterday Wasn't video game related, but but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it and it pissed me off What's that? I watched a whole crap ton of stargate sg1 that is pretty nerdy friend Becky And I are finally finishing up the fourth season box set And I remember how excited I was at e3 when they had the big stargate thing up And I was like oh hell. Yes. Do you want and then did the game ever come out? No? No? canceled I Was like don't let me take your picture in front of the giant stargate I remember that right that was awesome as I love me some stargate except. I do not like stargate at Linda's Okay, not very much. All right before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show any other games um No, all right not that there's anything wrong with a game of life not that there's anything wrong with a nerdy sci-fi Talk show because we have like pod culture. We know them and like them and Travis Donovan under station live they kind of do something Do it? Hi, Travis. All right moving on. Thank you. How was your gaming week? My gaming week was okay. I played I played Magnetica because I haven't actually tried that yet on the DS, and it was pretty fun it's sort of like Zuma a little bit, but They add a few things to actually make it different So that was kind of neat try to get my wife to play it And she said I don't like the way it aims and it that sucks So I'm not touching it then meanwhile she ends up playing it anyways and then still complains about it She's been playing super collapse 3 instead I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and I got to say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I Don't really care for the new 3d graphics. Especially when they they have all their like most of the cutscenes are in-game Using the in-game engine and when you get really close to some of those characters man those textures are really low-res but overall it's it's pretty good and And then I played also Korg 10 DS Which isn't really a game, but more of you know an actual piece of Synthesizer software and so played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10 I didn't really make much with it, but it's fun It's it'll be cool to play around with and then on a 360 Of course more Grantham thought of four I don't really have to say much more about that and Also Tried out on the Wii Wario Land shake which just got released in Japan and It's awesome. It really is it's You know a perfect example of how they can do really good 2d platform games now with the technology That's out there all hand-drawn animation. They have anime cutscenes It's really cool. It really is and sadly enough. If only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game at e3 they might have actually saved their you know a little press conference, but whatever and Then let's see what else that I play. I think that's about it. Actually. This is pretty brief Alright, well my gaming week. I also played Final Fantasy 4 quite a bit that pretty much dominated by gaming week You know Final Fantasy 4 is probably My favorite maybe either my favorite or my second favorite I haven't decided but it's one of my favorites of the is fun entire Final Fantasy series I definitely like it more than any of the PlayStation ones or even Final Fantasy 10 or hell even 12. I Love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS It's kind of interesting because the difficulty you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty if you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2 American like I did you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty, you know you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and Just you didn't really have to grind or anything like that. You do need to do a little bit not a lot I mean that gets annoying in role-playing games. You'll have to do a lot of grinding You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't you know Getting completely overpowered by the enemies You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you the speed of how they're attacking You know and all of that you can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game And it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience. Also, you have the new translation and everything I really like that they put voice acting in the game It's kind of neat even though it only shows up in a few select scenes. They actually pull it off on the DS pretty well It's not a plus level voice acting but it's not terrible It does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years My biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki I don't like the graphics. I don't like the look very much of what they've given the game It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game Well, it's like all the cutscene choppy and even thought it feels like even Final Fantasy 7 looked better than this The cutscenes don't have the same like style of graphics as you know, the actual game itself, you know The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just like Cartoony, it's not like Final Fantasy 7 where you know, the graphics were kind of cartoony But the cutscenes the characters were also a bit cartoony as well It's just it doesn't match whatsoever. You go with this really like super deformed looking character to like ultra realistic It's just not I don't know what it is But I would have almost just preferred redone sprites like I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games Those games are beautiful and they're still sprite based but they look amazing You know, I really like the look on those and that's kind of what I've almost wish This had been and I I see Game Guru and Chad is saying just get Final Fantasy 4 advanced I mean, yeah, but that was just basically a port with you know, the new translation and and possibly that ramped up difficulty I mean I do like some of the other frills in the DS game such as I kind of think that whole Wit the the extra summon there Rydia has the wit that you can actually customize I don't know how far you got but once you pick up Rydia and you can't you actually get to Kaipo the desert town You kind of can play your first, you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons That will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands You actually level it up through these silly little DS games like the math game Which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game. Maybe it's just the nerd in me I don't know, but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game I like the whole map thing that they use the bottom screen is basically a map of a dungeon and when you get a hundred Percent completion on a map like if you've explored the whole map You get like a little bonus Like maybe an extra tent or an extra Phoenix down something definitely for the completionist in all of us And I do also kind of like that You know It seems like the abilities that were removed in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's prey ability Cecil's darkness ability these things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on advance Maybe with a new translation I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD based system even ps2 You know, I just think the graphics would have been a lot better. I I just maybe I'm biased or whatever you call I just don't like the DS for think for projects like this I don't like that all these things these redone old classic games are coming out all on the DS because I don't You know the DS Kind of lends itself to a different outside the box kind of game making not so much the translations of old games exactly I think I'll play this more when it comes out on the PSP when we get like Final Fantasy 3 and 4 I hope I hope it does just like they did 1 & 2 I mean because I liked 1 & 2 I thought well I didn't really like to that much but I I wouldn't have liked it no matter what system it was on But Final Fantasy 1 I liked a lot on there and I like the way they did it It doesn't have to be all fancy 3d graphics and to be honest, you know I think they wasted a lot of effort with it because now they have to redo all the characters redo all the scenes and all That stuff and for what it just looks mediocre I don't know and Bobby Blackwell's trying to be cute and chat make a joke. He says confirmed. Oh, LR DS haters No, I'm not a DS hater. I like the games that are kind of made for a DS like trauma center great game You can't play that really anywhere else I mean, I guess you can't on the Wii but that's a whole nother story cooking mama is actually kind of fun on the DS You know, there's lots of these types of games on the DS even even things like Metroid Prime hunters and stuff that you can't really Get you know on other types of systems. I don't like Trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of you know how to control a game And that's the other thing that's my other big problem with Final Fantasy 4 is that it needs an analog stick Trying to control Cecil which all these years I thought it was Cecil but according to the voice acting at Cecil trying to control Cecil in that 3d environment Where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees it sucks because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little You know, I don't know about okay I don't know if if there were other like things that I missed but I you can control the way he runs and stuff Using the stylus, but I was unable to like interact with anybody Using the stylus. I had to like stop and push a button which I thought was retarded You do need to play a little more Final Fantasy 4 and get your wit leveled up so we can do the wireless battle Because I'm kind of curious how that works Okay So play play a little more at least till you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know How many people I know are gonna get this game? Although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy fangirl, it's worth checking out Especially if you've never played the game You've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great But if you have played the old games you you know have already kind of made your way through them I still say it's worth a look. It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper because it's a $40 DS game, but It's not gonna be a waste of your time. It is, you know, kind of a different experience. So there you have it And then Bobby and chat commented again. He said confirmed. Oh LR likes to debunk black wolf. Oh Bobby you're great Game guru says look every port or remake of an nest and super nest for the DS means no PlayStation Network or virtual console Port and that makes me mad. I kind of I kind of agree I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 Uh recreations or any guide because those were great. I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people but I would like to see a New approach taken to it. I just kind of don't want it on the DS. I'd like to see it as a Remade for at least the ps2 if nothing else make it a budget title for the ps2 if nothing else There'll be tons of people that want it We'll see also in my gaming week I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more civilization revolution, which is a game I think is pretty cool, and I noticed Bobby black wolf was playing Civ revolution speaking of Bobby He was playing that quite a bit this weekend So I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on civilization revolution Even though I'm not that great at the game. He'll probably beat me Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it and Also, I've been playing that new Xbox Live arcade game that came out the The street dancing game whose name I accidentally closed the window. What was it the go-go beat? Let me look at go go beat steady, I think that was the name of it I had it earlier. I play I was just you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of go go break steady that's name it I played it for a little bit and I Kind of like the concept. I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this guitar room and style You know buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside and the better you hit them in rhythm Then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma and I kind of thought that was cool It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game But I know there are people that do get excited for that. So I'm glad there's a decent music video Music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone. It's worth checking out But I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music I think it could be kind of cool So that's it for my gaming week Housekeeping tonight before we get into some gaming news honestly don't have a lot just gonna give the same old plugs We usually do for you know, our Facebook community at facebook.com search for the ol army You can join us on there at live journal we are username orange lounge on live journal and we always you know post little plugs for the show or other bonus things we do and Of course our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com our myspace orange lounge radio and our YouTube channel Is that orange lounge radio? I believe is our YouTube. It's been a long time as I've logged into I believe That's orange lounge radio. I've still yet to put my video Yes, you need to put your video on there and I'm gonna be putting the olr PSAs on there as well For the folks that want to hear those again outside the show We're gonna put those on there too, even though there's not a lot of video to go with them. At least it's something All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Shall we sure? All right. All right All right. Well, you know being that e3 was not really this week, but last week There's been a lot of you know Either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it and a couple publishers one being Bethesda has been trying to defend e3 saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit and You know kind of what they've been saying is You know before it used to be very, you know bustling very lots of people in there but now it's just vacant and You know, not that many people come and visit them and I think Bethesda. I mean, they're not a small Publisher by any means but at the same time they're not like I remember when you know you guys visit Bethesda Their booth wasn't that big not compared to like, you know, EA or you know, Microsoft or something like that So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more it's a lot of people might miss going to visit you know these smaller publishers that are there so that kind of sucks and Bethesda's booth was interesting though because is basically imagine their booth space was kind of like a donut where they had everything kind of around it They had some things on display kind of around on the on the actual donut shape but then in the middle where the donut hole would be was that like kind of special room where they were doing their little press events and dark soccer and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and Sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out which that was great Unfortunately, it was one of those games. It was awesome in theory, but the execution unfortunately by the time the game actually came out It didn't work out so well, but we got excited about it watching is it was great in theory I actually taped the whole thing how they recreated the Erathicon battle was pretty awesome I know that was sweet, but yeah, anyhow, sorry, but but they just say that it needs to change They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they you know want to change it, but I Don't know, but yay. Yay another Company also displeased with the current e3 Ironically enough though. They're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now They wish to invite the community to the show It's a bit ironic when you think about it because they were one of the companies Complaining that there was too many people at e3 and that they couldn't get any business done So instead they want to go back to where the way it was and then some I seem to remember us bringing up this Almost exact not not exactly sure if I seem to remember EA making similar comments last week Although I think this week it was what Peter Moore that said them specifically and you know Which is interesting because he used to be kind of Xbox's, you know spokesperson at those press conferences and things But it's just interesting. It's not it's not stopping from EA, you know, it's now now here we go Another person at EA kind of speaking up saying here's gosh We missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place, but Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got I don't know they move this way Okay, and I know a lot of people aren't gonna agree with this cuz you know They haven't gone to e3 and they want to I don't think that they should let the public into e3 Because as it was it was so fucking packed before You know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts. You're not gonna get anything done What they need to do is find some happy medium between the old e3 and the new e3 So maybe lacks up the amount of you know People that they're allowing to be invited these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking e3 anymore because it's just too Strict but before I mean there was people like, you know, Walmart employees that work on their garden section Just because Walmart carries video games. They got in the e3, you know weird shit like that If they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there Then I think it would be a little bit better I Don't know about adding the public I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff I like the format that they have with the press conferences and stuff because it's a lot easier to digest the information And you know what? Maybe it might not be so bad with the press conferences there and actually being able You know since you're not gonna be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's gonna be fucking mobbed Um, I gotta say this this is very interesting the comments again I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving good giving us good stuff tonight Bobby in our chat room and chat I don't want to come he says Peter Moore loved the community Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiasts press last year when Peter Moore was in charge this year They didn't really care about us as much and it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very They're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are you know way more out there with the community And everything I mean heck you can get an OLR gamer pic on the Xbox live marketplace You know that's saying something right there if our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world You know what? I mean? That's you know, it kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community Kind of interesting, but you know, I like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how okay Let's this was the first year that the we I mean it was coming out that same year and that And that booth was fucking mobbed. It was just impossible You couldn't walk through it say you wanted to see a game and you finally did see it You'd take you like 30 minutes just to get out of the booth and it was just awful And can you imagine adding you'll say I'm not saying double that but can you imagine adding like even another half of that? I mean, I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness it honestly I don't I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only but make it you know kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in I think that will Really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, you know Namely us but it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees But I do think there should be room to for actual, you know, the game say I definitely deserve a place in there But you know somehow Screening us that it's really only the people that really work with games in these places I I am actually okay with the GameStop employees of America being with their I do think the types of things that EA if you I like educated GameStop employees who've played the games and stuff. I think everybody does so why why not invite retail? It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know it's like some of these years It's hard to see everything I think that the way that these do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see Everything and then you can decide which you need to go see further. I like that I like that a lot because that works before the gamers days Digest all the information the publishers can make sure that the people that that they have the information that they want out there And if they want to you know further show it off, you know Maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes But you know, hey, this game is playable at our booth. Go check it out, you know, or hey, you know Let's set up some times to come, you know, visit the booth and play the game All right. Well, let's move on talking about more e3 kind of fallout because obviously, you know I know it's been a couple weeks now since e3 but It is one of the highlights in the gaming year and of course Nintendo Got a lot of flack for their e3 press conference. And what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of I Don't know if you want to say they apologized but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception In fact Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week quote We are sorry about the media briefings specifically for those who are expecting to see Nintendo show something about Super Mario or Legend of Zelda If there's any perception that Nintendo is ignoring the core gamers It's a misunderstanding and we really want to get rid of that misunderstanding by any means so an interesting apology of sorts But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these kid Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true I think or at least now it's just I'm saying because all they showed was games for casual people. I mean, no, I hate, you know Distinguishing games between casuals and you know the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays But seriously Wii music is like an over glorified toy. There's no depth to it whatsoever It's just crap, but Loki you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Now. That is a hardcore game That's the thing but a logo Loki exactly, but here's that's that's one thing though that got it got me excited But they don't actually have to show anything just say hey, we're working on this I mean look at a couple years ago. They were showing off a video for Mario Kart Wii it didn't come out for two years after that, you know, same with the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess They had a really early teaser video for a few years prior to that and everyone got hyped up Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3 all they have to do is say, you know You know with that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the you know final product. It was great though It was epic in the making it showed nothing in the endgame the actual endgame footage But it was epic and theatrical and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3 even though they came out for a while Mike a Sony God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name Here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick I don't remember her name the new one that replaced parent Kaplan or whatever That's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on on there. I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games I mean, I honestly she may play the DS and play the fucking brain-age shit And she may be like one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer but that's the problem those because they don't play these games and they don't necessarily have to play it like a lot of games to Be it's not their job. It doesn't to make the games It isn't to make the games but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their you know audience that's what they should do because It just seemed like you know She's a buffoon and so they're having her play this game to make it look like look at this It's a snowboarding game, which is usually more of a hardcore game, but any idiot can play it. So why don't you go play it? That's the whole thing is making it more of a casual thing But they didn't have to do that much. They I mean they just said Oh Pokemon. Okay, this is coming out they could have showed a trailer for that they could have Showed Wario Land shake there's a perfect example of a game that can you know? Be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player Let me ask let me ask dark soccer because she's been awfully quiet through this But I'm just kind of curious of your opinion dark soccer I did Nintendo really make a misstep with this e3 or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place? I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing just because they obviously address the the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market because this the whole Big thing with business is you want to increase your market share. They know if they release a Zelda or a Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market. They have their loyal. We're already loyal. They'd be preaching to the choir. I think Where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince? I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this but they're trying to convince That's this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that Doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press You know, I think that they were smart in doing that I just think there should have been a little bit more mentioned so that like, you know Throw us a bone or something, but it's seriously their excuse though for doing this is like we don't have enough time We don't have enough time during our presentation to make these sorts of announcements and to be honest I mean their presentation was one of the shorter of the presentations out there and How long is it really gonna take to say we don't have any video footage to show you right now But our teams are working on new Mario and a new Zelda game Realize that we are that we already know they're working on some no But they don't have to go and make some sort of claim that you know, oh we're doing this when they know We want to keep these gamers We're gonna put out this game that goes without saying there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete To give us but you know what my wife knows that I love her But she likes to hear it every now one and again, so this is exactly why we have to do this They they may we may assume that they're doing this stuff But you know, what if we don't see it enough? We may not assume it anymore So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore Loki. Is that what it is? Yes, I think that exactly I think Nintendo We need to be cuddled. Okay, we have no more, you know Sega systems yet. We keep getting Sonic games You know Sega knows of their bread and butter is coming from you know, Nintendo isn't you know, it's Have succeeded this long. They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon eating chained to the jungle gym morons mmm, no mention name of people but I I think that when it then they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they Have parameters they have to keep in touch, you know, keep in mind I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out They know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more Curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market But your core is going to come to you every time but see I want to see if this actually works out for them because The problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now the mom and pops that bought You know the Wii system the play Wii Sports now, they're anticipating. Okay. Well, they're gonna buy this Wii Sports Resort thing I hope that's true because if it's not they're gonna end up with another fucking Was a big brain Academy game that came out on the Wii and the be honest No one bought it So there are they have had a lot of missteps in the casual market because they don't underestimate I don't think they really know who they're trying to target. All right, let me let me just summarize here I think all we want is that Reggie all we want is a cuddle But you know my thing and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know Yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a frickin bone Like for instance if we know that in the new Zelda game Link is gonna ride a gigantic spider then like show us the image of link riding a giant spider and you know Put out there link and the giant spider friend coming next fall You know give us something to and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go Oh my god. Did you see the giant spider? Exactly. That's all they have to do. Look at Mario Kart. Like I said, this is a perfect example Mario Kart They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a cart racing around. That was it. Nothing from the game No graphics whatsoever It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that oh my god Mario Kart's coming and it's not like that We didn't see Mario Kart coming because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system. So but still that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate another Mario game I For all I know it could be a crappy and you know, this is gonna come anyways We're like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf and but once again, that's not a hardcore game That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking we to play we sports stop catering the people that play Wii Sports There are other games out there. They sold their systems didn't they true? Yeah, that's true We you know what we would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability just a one little thing. Yeah, this is where it comes down to Bottom line money. What company is out there? You know if they were out there too, I guess be nice and sweet and cuddly that'd be you know, a not-for-profit organization As it is there they have to make money What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America? Your mom has more money than you do Um, well, we've done selective targeting for certain products and we feel that the adult demographic would be Okay, go ahead. Okay. I want to say there's a shower and in chat. It's great. He has a title for my new Zelda game It's called Legend of Zelda web of lies All right. Well what I was trying to say before is it you know, they probably see something. Oh well To expand our market we're going to appeal to a different demographic for aiming towards the older people who might have been our core Group at a younger age. We're trying to reclaim the market that is now quote grown out of video games You should you need to go get a job. Why do you think I was in technical writing for a while? Very nice. All right, Loki final. Okay, then we get him my final thought Basically, it's like this. Okay. It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market The problem is though is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't gonna necessarily Do a lot of good for you. The problem is you got to get people confident in your platform because Come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4 You're not gonna have a lot of people, you know wanting to buy your next system because They bought the Wii and that's all they play is Wii Sports. So why do they need to buy your next system? That's the problem. And if you cater these people that are just casual gamers They're not gonna come back for more. In fact when you have people buying that your next Nintendo system They may not buy your next Nintendo system They may just go somewhere else and that's where you're gonna end up hurting. It's down later on I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the Justin TVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read But I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about it in there Some folks are saying a Pokemon MMO is what's needed Could be interesting. I mean Pokemon sure is one of those Universal franchises that sells like, you know, it's free money, but MMO on a Wii would be very interesting That would be very easy to do actually if you think about it. I think so too. Because I mean, alright for example I can't believe it hasn't already happened Well for an example, um, actually a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture your Different creatures as your pets and then once they become loyal they help you fight I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually cat You know if they can do it on a regular video game Why can't they have it in multiplayer format and then you have like for example, like you have your arena system You can actually have your gyms be set up that way, you know, and you've got whoever you know It was like has the best group or whatever. So you have a continuously A rotating list and like maybe your gym leaders like one of the GM's or something. All right. Anyhow. Anyhow, let's move on It's a very very I know you have more Nintendo news, but hey stuff about Reggie, okay Reggie is like, okay we know pretty much said from an America centric perspective to quote that the Weezer storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like we wear in virtual console and he told MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution. So he says that Nintendo is working on something They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something but I Actually Think that they're gonna and while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB based at knowing Nintendo They're going to try to do something proprietary something that can't be mimicked something that no one's gonna be able in theory No one's going to be able to break and just you know hack their own like, you know We used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives. Remember? Yeah, they're going to try to do something That's that they would have control over. It's just frustrating though because they put USB slots They put SD card slots in that we why does it have to be freaking proprietary? You know like it by doing that it kind of showed the promise of Oh mass storage Hey good idea, and it's not being used. I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you be something really simple It could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing. Just open up USB to use storage devices Your problem solved right there. It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer I mean, it's no different than it is gonna make from that. I'm sorry. Where's the money for them to make from that? Oh, you don't have to make money off everything show Nintendo USB drives That they'll release in stores along with that for ten dollars more than the generic brands will cause I still think they're gonna have some Way to system lock and even if they do it via USB they're gonna have some sort of code that you have to read off of the The storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing To hack the system. I think I seriously think what it is. So you that's why it's Investment From a business perspective They're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their power Let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system Well, they were aiming for a certain price for their system. I mean, but they're paying for it now Now the gamers are like now it's kind of like they put the cart before the whole horse with this whole we wear thing Oh great. They're filling up that drive. I can't wait for the special dog and no dongle the attachment It's gonna attach to as well that's gonna give it high-def graphics Oh, maybe we'll get someone that you know, gives us some good online or maybe I don't know one that gives us some better games Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades As I mean think about it. I bet you any this is this is my prediction Okay We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii it's either going to run Off of USB or have some sort of it Either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage Whatever with the Wii and then as it progresses we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something, you know Maybe the you know new upgrade they drop the price the old we bring out the new we at the rigor price of storage becomes You know even more cheap as the you know, time goes by and we're going to get a new Nintendo Yeah, that's why I understand they can't do that now because the price of flash storage has gone down so much They could just say okay going forward now all the ways that we put out are gonna have four gigs of storage instead Yeah, I'll piss off a lot of people but you know what tough All right, I'm was at least There the Reggie admits the problem is out there Even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that the whole American centric perspective At least they they are finally admitting there's a problem Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from Has been and this is at least as far as I've seen to has been mostly the American market So I think he's saying well at least Nintendo of America loves you It's our cuddle Rob interesting I guess maybe that was our cuddle, I don't know we'll see Oh Smack him in the fucking face. Seriously. Oh, yeah, we acknowledge there's a problem now Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that. He needs a little love Would he be so angry if somebody would oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people. Oh, that would be awesome I think that Loki needs something that starts with the D and ends with the E and there's two words. It's called duct tape Loki on my own. Yeah, my only wish is that you know, you take your little media badge at this event This is Orange Lounge radio and you put a sticker over it. This is Bobby Black Wolf show before you go people I'll take it a step further. I'll put my name is Someone follow follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking, but we'll be like, okay interviews over next ding-ding-ding-ding-ding So speaking of newest Rob you would you would love it if I just like put on a mask and like dress up like Captain Anger or something You could be mr. Furious mr. Furious. All right, let's move on Apparently because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing That certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market These would include any a Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks. So any of your classic controllers your GameCube controllers those are going to be taken from the market and Of course the Wii remote and nunchuck are okay because it was only have one analog stick and this is all because of that wonderful 21 million dollar patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and escape That has sued them and you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money or licensing rights Do you think it's actually gonna happen I don't know it it's well, I mean they have to pay them because it You know, the verdict has been placed The thing is though there's well second level appeals room court appeal Well escape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make Controllers, I guess I don't honestly think that they're gonna try to make controllers I think that there's money would have kind of done it by now Yeah, Lord. Katsu. Hito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat dot orange hundred calm probably most likely It's usually the way these things go Anyways Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii bonus content feature very soon over in Japan It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16 digit code into this bonus thing and you get a new Present so to speak the Wii speaker channel is the first thing that's supposed to be used using this It's coming with that, you know that game on the Nintendo DS I think we talked about it a few weeks ago that it's kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio translation of channels or whatever Interesting, but there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for we points free download games virtual console sell it and sell virtual console games in stores kind of like what Xbox Live does with their Own redemption system like you can buy Uno or Texas hold them like in a store on a card and give it as a gift So I don't think that's what this is for. I Think if it even comes out here Yes, and I think this the only thing this is it's to deter piracy Because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately Ironically enough though all those bonus things that they're talking about like the Wii speaker channel leaked to the internet anyways So it's not gonna matter Well, there is a Something that I think is gonna be very very very Cool to come out at least in Japan, and I don't think we're gonna get it here But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the purika the print club stuff, but it's actually not quite It's called the digi cam print channel. That's going to be on the Wii. It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm where You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and You can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book. That's 1575 yen Or you can get a Mario one. That's 2480 And you can actually even have them print it out to well you can Have your meshi printed out which is a Japanese business card you hit it's like your name card, basically You know the the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it Mm-hmm, but you can have your meshi with your Wii on it and you've got your Wii be your me on it for 500 yen for 30 cards, so it's actually pretty cool I wish we could get something like this would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game I have on those cards, too. I Don't see why not I mean I would think so that actually would be a very smart idea To have you know your your friend could be both you and I need to be working at Nintendo But I'll tell you what and the good idea department And I'm gonna link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube and I'm looking at it. It's actually pretty pretty cool. This is actually a Fujifilm's demo showing how it works And it's it's really really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes And have messages on them It's actually very cool and also send them to to people it seems pretty cool What I'm seeing on this do you think it's something that would work here, or is this is this better for Japan's culture? I think it is it's more Surrounded around I would say how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right Why not I mean if the channel already exists? It's just translation and and on Fujifilm's end you know or whatever company they partnered with in America Just a matter of you know I was gonna say Fujifilm's here So why not fish as long as they have a presence of getting the oh is that are they behind snapfish? I don't know. Oh, I'm mentioning snapfish every you know every photo company has had to evolve to maintain Competition with the digital photography, so I'm sure they have something set up the way that I see this is that if If like say you know rock bands are going through rock band to you know have their musical presence Fortified in the industry when you know everything is digital download and all that then why can't you know the photo companies make use of? This I think it's a good idea And on top of that is it's convenient instead of having to take you know a CD in to have it printed Or do it yourself. You just be no pay 15 bucks and have them send you a photo album with everything in it Game guru in chat says damn sooner or later. They will fill the Wii with just channels kind of Kind of a good point because you know the Wii only has four screens worth of channels I want the channel channel the channel channel the change channel channel Now as unfortunately as they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to Store all those channels Yeah Alpha Kananagrams in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP big fan of the whole Fuji film channel idea all right. We will see Well, this isn't for the Wii, but it uses the Wii remotes there is a brand new homebrew game made called dark room sex game and what this basically is is two people will take the Wii remotes, and they will kind of make a kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the Pornographic sounds there's no images. It's just all audio That you hear on the screen, and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8 I I Wish I had brought my bluetooth Adapter next week though we can maybe do this on the show You know for that For that extra. It's all audio array. It'll be awesome All right, yeah gold banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat weirdest homebrew ever But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there. I believe they have a It's a website itu.dk slash stud slash darkroom is Right and game grew in chat says the kind of obvious comment here. Why not you know have sex Because this is this is safer. You can't can't contract babies or a okay. I see AIDS and baby free I get it, so there's there's I guess the Positive unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had in which case you could probably you yeah You might be able to get genital herpes Herpes maybe using the proper now make it a gear attachments All right, well, please let's change the topic real quick here. I have them and talk about, Castlevania Because Castlevania is pretty awesome Castlevania why Castlevania has to follow a story about a sex game is because Castlevania is sex I mean Castlevania is that good and I Had no idea this was coming, but apparently there's a Castlevania arcade game Akumajo Dracula the arcade and there's been some location tests going on over in Japan and Some folks are already kind of leaking their opinions to the internet Apparently you can actually enter the machine from one side or the other. There's a pretty spacious inside and There was LED lit candles on the inside of the machine which I think is kind of cool You hold a controller that's shaped like the handle of a whip and the top of the whip also has LEDs in it First player has blue one second player gets dark pink ones And then you have a little yellow trigger on the whip where your index finger goes and that is for sub weapons like knives Crosses potions all of that stuff, and then there's another button where your thumb is so apparently And that thumb button is used for items later in the game You stand in a designated spot you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things and then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out And they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them So that's kind of neat and then of course the weapons like knives. They do take hearts. Just like the game That's like 25 heart, so it sounds like a shooting game with like a Castlevania twist on it So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii Possibly there's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii rumors I Think that there's more than one way to do it too. It doesn't necessarily have to be we only This sounds neat in theory though. It does and it sounds pretty cool speaking of Silent Hill I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now. I know Comcast is nationwide I don't know if they're on demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the on demand in HD For free on Comcast on demand so I actually watched it this weekend with William and and he well He'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all He needed me to explain it to him so we watched it, and I did but I'll tell you what Silent Hill in HD very very hot Sweet is very good-looking movie And I I still like Silent Hill as a movie And I hope that I hope the rumors of the sequel are true that they are doing it. I hope so, too Okay, well how about some release dates Rob? How about it? Well for the 30th in the UK? we have double D dodgeball on Xbox 360 and Geometry Wars retro evolved to on Xbox 360 On the first though is a whole crap ton of stuff brothers in arms hell's highway Ferrari challenge and that's on we by the way a flat-out ultimate carnage on PC hellboy the science of evil for ps3 Sbk o8 Superbike World Championship on some systems and Soulcalibur 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Cool sounds pretty hot in the US We have a few things coming out this week Soulcalibur 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 spectral force 3 on the 360 from Atlas summer athletics on PlayStation 2 we and Xbox 360 your generic summer olympics game and We've got romance of the three kingdoms 11 on the PC city life 2008 edition on PC SNK arcade classics volume 1 on the Wii MLB power pros 2008 on PlayStation 2 and the Wii Everlight on the PC art of murder FBI confidential on PC deadliest catch Alaskan storm on PC and Let's see here also in the u.s.. This week. We've got Beijing 2008 on the PC and Baseball mogul 2009 on PC and legend the hand of God on PC lots of easy games this week Sounds like fun. It sounds like Soulcalibur 4 pretty much dominating the console really pretty much Yeah, and if you don't want to play a fighting game spectral force 3 looks like a pretty good role-playing game So there you go a very similar story over in Japan doing the Japanese release date So we also have Soulcalibur 4 being a big presence in the Xbox 360 this week in Japan being released on the 31st of July Also a special fighting stick is coming out from Hori to kind of commemorate Soulcalibur 4 Beijing Olympics 2008 also coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan going over to the PlayStation 3 they're also getting Soulcalibur 4 of course on the 31st, and they are also getting the special fighting stick as well and If you want Beijing Olympics 2008 on PlayStation 3 guess what here you go It's coming out in Japan this week now going over the Nintendo Wii not a lot of games I've heard of before but they do have a Dokapon Kingdom for Wii is coming out on on the 31st as well as Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo is coming out as well and Zero Gesu no Kamen comes out as well this week And that game looks to be like a little bit of a survivor horror type game. So this game actually looks kind of cool Kind of looking at some of the CG from the game. It's like crazy Fatal Frame 4. Is that what this is? Yeah, ah, it's their version of Fatal Frame 4 very Cool. I was gonna say that Dokapon Kingdom. That's that party game from Atlas the one that's Promising that you'll ruin your friendship with your friends if you play it Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was on Mario Party type game. Yeah. What about this other one since we looked at the other two Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo looks like I Think it's like a it looks like one of those 200 in game 250 games in a game type thing It looks a little weird. All right, probably not so many people going over that Other systems, let's go to the handheld systems to see what's coming out in Japan. I'm sorry first PlayStation 2 Drastic Killer comes out this week Galaxy Angel 2, Gino Express Hoshifuru Kanokan Isui all come out this week on the PlayStation 2 going over to the handhelds and looking at what's coming out there Quite a bit Dream Baseball on the DS comes out as well Dokapon Journey also on the Nintendo DS Doki Doki Module Shinpan 2 comes out as well as SNK What that's the one where you you fondle the the girls. It's oh my god Wow, they actually made a sequel that look at that The top screen is her face and the bottom screen is her boobies on the DS there That's a Doki Doki Module Shinpan 2 all in the name of fighting witches. Yes Also coming out Rhythm Tenku Gold comes out this week on the DS Steel Princess Tozoku Ojou Windy Cross Windom comes out as well lots and lots of DS releases this week PSP Looking at those releases a little bit going on over there as well fantasy star portable being the most notable of the releases in Japan This week Panic Palette portable and Giga Ojou Somo Denotsu Collection Oh Joe Soma. Yeah, it's the PC Engine best collection. It's a PC Engine best collection It's three PC Engine games I'm not sure what games they are. That looks familiar. I just don't know what that is. They're I'm a chick fighting. Yeah, it looks very familiar something I don't know if it's come out or coming out though that I want from overseas. Hmm. What's that? That's um, the uh, a Fantasy zone collection. I think we've covered it before they're shooters. Just you know, yeah That's really familiar. I probably have a couple of them All right. Well, there you have it your Japanese release dates busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan well, um speaking of other busy events is that um, there has been a little um, I guess Controversy regarding a lack of halo information from what I understand the e3 But they actually were saying that halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote Big enough at this point that it can stand on its own so there are a few hints going around and they've mentioned comic-con and other Conventions that there might be a halo con. In fact, um Let me go see if I can't get this name Just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy well, um But it was I guess one of the the higher-ups saying that you can do a halo con Nothing on the scale of comic-con, but you could bring a few hundred people to see a halo thing If there were a Microsoft and bungee endorse like halo tournament uber thing. I bet I bet people would come It depends where they have it Rob. I'd go It won't wait. It would depend on where they have it. I'd go I mean, I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive maybe even la heck. Yeah, who knows? Well, halo con possibly coming soon. I see kidnapped the press to bring him to that. You know Scared the crap out of them. Let's be fun cosplay Master Chief You think there'd be Master Chief cosplay halo con I would hope and Cortana and all your favorite and people dress up like Star Wars Characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is. I don't know why In fact someday when we have a well our con, you know some way it was some day way in the way in the future We encourage people to come as Star Wars cosplayers Yeah, because um, well Microsoft has actually made a games for Windows lives free for all Maybe because the service didn't really I don't know Fulfill what it's promised to be really take off. Yeah, it kind of Didn't necessarily meet a kind of butter. But anyways, um, so yes, if you did pay for it already they are refunding your money and it is effective immediately that games such as like Halo 2 and shadowrun and all future releases are free to play and Actually, I heard another interesting rumor 3 is awesome, I think you're thinking the same thing I am what did you hear I heard the rumor that the games that are cross-platform enabled like shadowrun and I want to say there was another one lost planet Those if you have an Xbox 360 version of you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now and then away to more Things possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox. That could be very interesting We'll see is it because it's probably just competition from things like steam and other products that exist, you know out there all these kind of competing Portals for games on PC so to speak. It's lost planet colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform Yeah, according to act deft and chat Well, I like free so that's pretty cool. Except, you know, what did you hear play Halo on the computer the same thing? Okay, that the silver accounts on Xbox live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit One game I'm excited about when it comes to Xbox live in the future Which by the way, it's not just coming to Xbox live supposed to be on PlayStation Network and Nintendo We wear Mega Man 9 who is not excited about Mega Man 9 what you? Get off my show. No, I'm just kidding This this Mega Man 9 looks great And I think it's cute that they're kind of going the extra mile with the retro goodness of this and an e3 some Mega Man 9 Box art t-shirts were spotted and it is the same classic cheesy box art with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art, you know It's like somebody happily great someone in Capcom got the joke. Yeah in other words Well, they are actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art Including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon Awesome. Did you see the other one that they put out? Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other Meatbun.com I think it was what it was. No, it was the 1942 Pinup girl thing with cami that shirt. Oh, I saw that not as funny. I ordered one Did you you would I need new teeth. That was the other game. I played on Xbox live this week I didn't even talk about 1942 now. That's how you remake a retro game for Xbox live That's all I have to say that was I only played on Xbox live That's all I have to say that was I only played the demo But I was I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port I have in a long time other than maybe pac-man championship edition so just check that out if you were if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases because 1942 was pretty awesome. I gotta say I like uh, the 19. What was the 1942 kai? That was a good one But I want to see the the 1940 xx ones remade. Wouldn't that be cool? That would be really sweet but um Going back to the whole retro side of thing is that um, there's a hint that um, Igarashi is planning on doing a new castlevania in 2d For we on we wear that's going to be pretty cool. Um It's uh supposed to be um Trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the castlevania series so, um He says that he's gonna um pay attention to how a mega man 9 Uh is with the market and base his decision on that. So that's that's smart I like this trend mega man 9 seems to be starting. Yeah, this could be very good I think it's like, you know, it would also be very bad We love our 2d but no one wants to really admit it in the 3d market until someone just says ah screw it We're doing it anyway, and they're like, hey, they're making money on this I don't think safe for very little money into it. You know, let's do it I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it. I just don't understand why they don't Why more people haven't been doing 2d games they sell just as well People people are sucked in by 3d I think someone figured out where to touch that retro nerve and that was capcom with the the mega man and now they got people Excited now the other companies are going huh? Could could we make money too could could retro goodness be a money-making machine now the problem it hopefully just the pool doesn't get diluted Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything I don't know. I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means actually have to work on it you know versus I don't know just like hoarding something from like the playstation 2 or the gamecube true true this is something that's pretty exciting and I don't know why i'm excited about it since I you know up until a couple weeks ago Didn't know what the hell the watchman was Um, I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it Although I am interested in reading it now. But anyways, um at comic con they announced that they're going to be making Um watchman episodic games on the pc ps3 and the 360 And these are going to coincide with the theatrical and dvd release of the films So i'm assuming running up through march and you know, whenever the hell the film comes out And they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storyline. So that's kind of cool and they showed off some footage of it and the first uh, the kind of level that they showed off was with night owl and uh row shot and it was kind of um Pretty cool like beat him up type game Game, they said it's also being um crafted by the person that's uh, or I should say the team behind faith in a 45 uh, which I want to say was a game cop Game cock game that was supposed to be coming out. No, actually, I think that that didn't have a publisher yet but uh faith in 45 looked pretty awesome, so um Looks good. Can't wait to see it Uh tiger high in our chat room wanted to point out loki Warner brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of the watchman on itunes The first chapter is free cool So if you're into the watchman, this is a very happy period of time for you Uh, also a very happy period of time for geometry wars fans because geometry wars 2 is coming and guess what? Unlike most xbox live arcade news. We usually have it's coming earlier than anticipated. That's great news Uh, it's coming this week. July 30th is the big day for geometry wars 2 the bad news It's not another five dollar game It's a ten dollar game, but supposedly, uh, this game has a lot of new features And you can even see from the early screenshots kind of like a four player mode in this game, which looks to be pretty awesome um, so I will definitely be checking this out and downloading it and apparently the trial version of geometry wars 2 is like the full deadline game mode including Multiplayer support but only locally but that's still pretty cool that the demo seems to be pretty generous for this game so well, then the multiplayers are online anyways, because You know with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online because the lag is true. That's true Uh, and bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on xbox live for the new geometry wars Yes, there is I downloaded it and checked it out. Looks looks pretty neat Uh, I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat Uh, the graphics have this kind of adjusted Uh, I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what but I have a feeling this might be the final product this adjusted Like soft tone to them that makes it look like an old vetrex game or something It looks like they put vaseline on the camera lens But it it sounds better than loki's describing it It makes it gives a real soft look to it that gives an old 80s game flare. So it's kind of cool. I like that All right, it'd be awesome to have geometry wars on vetrex like someone to do a homebrew game You never know people are pretty crazy All right, uh, this is now the part of the show where we're gonna take a quick break Um, but not until we get to the classic game of the week because we always before the break like to talk A little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness, which how appropriate following a story about geometry wars 2 Which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming Dark soccer is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out and this week's title If I'm not saying it's pretty obscure at least it was one I had never heard of until I saw it on because I get I get to know before the rest of you I saw it on the show roll this week So i'm very curious to hear more about this game tonight in dark soccer's classic game of the week The classic game of the week is a game that was on the neo geo systems, um put out by um Sauris is the developer. Um, it's called shock troopers Shock troopers is really freaking awesome Um, basically, it's imagine how like a plane shooter game would be except you're running on the ground and that's what you've got Um You um, basically you can uh fire your guns in eight directions. You can strafe you can um Uh, if you attack uh point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and the extra life things like that You can you actually have a dodge button too There's a team battle mode. Um, you can uh, pick different, uh soldiers in the game and everything Um and actually, um One of the uh, the cool things about this is that um, it was actually intense. It was uh, From what I understand that it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to metal slug So that's actually pretty cool even though it, you know completely is in a different, uh Direction, but you've got uh different characters too. You have jackal who has a grenade for special weapon milky who uses napalm There's a loki in this who uses explosive shells Southern cross who uses a boomerang marie b who has a rocket launcher Rio has exploding arrows maru has grass gas grenades and big mama has a grenade launcher I want to play this game as big mama. That sounds awesome But as you go through the game, um, you can actually pick a different path the jungle mountain or valley um, and you can switch to a different route or Continue on the same so it's basically sort of a running gun sort of sort of game cool The guy has a flamethrower right there looks like a kari warrior watching it. Yeah, it looks like a car Yeah, it is a lot like a warrior a lot more souped up Um, and there's also one called shock trooper second squad Um, that's supposed to be stand alone. Um, no connection Um, and uh, you can only choose the four characters, um, and it has no team mode It is also a little bit more cartoony and um, the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them Um, because it's actually it's a lot completely too deep. The 3d graphics are pre-rendered. So It's actually a release on playstation 2 and psp So that's pretty cool. It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade classics volume one and now you can get it on the wii 2 That just came out Really yeah smk arcade. Oh, oh the class. Oh, I thought you meant on virtual console. I'm like really I don't remember Okay, I like the music in it too. It's very, you know, let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it Cool, all right. Yeah, pretty cool. So there it is your classic game of the week shock troopers for the neo geo Pretty awesome. I think it's just the neo geo arcade systems. Well, you know close enough Yeah, it never took that back. It did come out on the um, avs I was gonna say couldn't you get just about any arcade came out on the avs? Is it a hard to find one? I don't think so. Okay. I just had forgotten about it. That's all right All right. So there you have it shock troopers your classic game of the week and we are going to take a quick break But we will be back in just a minute with more of orange lounge radio again We are this is probably last time i'll remind you guys. We are one big show now So if you're listening on the podcast just stay tuned and we're going to take a free break And we'll be back with more of orange lounge radio for those listening live You got some music coming your way. We'll be back Hi, this is your buddy rob roberts here recently I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on xbox live You always can't suck my fucking dick. I just got a dick in your ass. Do I have dick in your butt? Can where's barbie? Yeah, where's barbie? Is that urkel urkel's your barbie, huh? She in malibu or no, please stop spewing hate speech on xbox live It doesn't make you look cool. It won't get you any friends and at the end of the day You still have an incredibly small penis Gaming radio so uncensored And even tom brokaw could get a job with us, uh, mocha mochake orange lounge radio So Welcome back boys and girls to orange lounge radio. We are live here on this lovely sunday evening july the 27th 2008 For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat orange lounge radio calm All right, we're halfway there. We got plenty more news to cover tonight. Uh, let's get right into it Loki start us off If you can put you on your ds for five minutes come back to the show you are I'm, sorry. Am I interrupting something loki? I was just playing cord 10 ds. Anyways, um, there are rumors via linked Or I should say a leaked pictures of a I guess a psp case Um saying that the psp 3000 has already been or is in works right now In fact, this supposedly picture is of one of the designs that they I don't know didn't go with and um some of the features though on this design which may you know Reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final psp 3000 design Includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a playstation button much like on the um Ps3 six axis or dualshock 3 controllers, so i'm not too surprised by that I'm, not too surprised by that. Um That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet Because there may be a whole nother psp coming out And i'm sure this one will be completely unhackable Oh, yeah, because sony prevented that now you they they said we're putting stuff to this right now. That's right It's only taking us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it. Absolutely no more All right. Well, what do you think? I mean is it time for the psp to get a remodel or is it too soon or will it drive sales? What? um I don't think it's going to drive sales I mean it might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone it may allow them to do More things with it depending on what features they add to it You know with a built-in microphone you can play crappy karaoke games You can do the stupid stuff that they do with the ds where you can blow into the microphone to do things I don't know Um might be kind of cool to do really crappy skype Without using a headset with it. I guess that's true voice over ip possibly, you know You could do some side talking so sony fans next time. Uh, someone tries to tell you the psp blows you can say yes it does right Or you blow on the psp you blow the psp, you can go blow the psp. Um Um, hey one of the uh, interesting games that was being shown at e3 this year by sony was a little game called fat princess Um, very unique standout title. That's for sure. And apparently the game is playable with 32 people online. Uh, and uh, what's It just kind of looks interesting. It has a very unique kind of art style to it kind of looks like a cartoon thing but apparently The feminist gamers are not happy is his actual gaming blog feminist gamers.com Gamers.com is one gaming blog and shakes shakesville is another one Shakespeare's sister.blogspot.com which by the way great 90s band with shakespeare's sister, uh, these uh blogs are not happy. Uh, they are voicing. Uh, Great displeasure to sony, uh in shakespeare. They said quote congrats on your awesome new game sony I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating heteronormative assholes and then uh feminist gamer, uh, Quoted quote instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with why not go out and find gold To stuff into a treasure chest the more gold in the chest the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry Uh, so obviously some women groups are getting very upset now titan studios The art director there has actually came out and commented on the whole situation after this, uh, he actually um Said does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look characters and everything is a girl? So how about they all just shut up and get over it? Learn to be offended people. It's not you know, if people got their you know Less of a stick up their ass about certain things. I think the world would be a whole lot nicer. Don't you? And notice that the game is called fat princess. It's not saying like all women are fat I mean if they put out a game called that I can see where people might get a little bit offended But it's just a princess who happens to be fat But let let us remember the mika song big girl. You are beautiful What's what's wrong with you know this this is just it's innocent I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this. You know what I mean? So Yeah, there you have it. I'm curious chat. Is it is it offensive or no? Let's see, uh, Game guru says they complain about unrealistic looks for women with laura croft. I guess trying to say, you know, laura you know, it should be called or the game should be called fat princess gets no love and Because she's fat. Let's see. That's wrong. That's right. That's offensive. Uh, janaya says fat kirby I don't see kirby's pretty fat. How how about this? How about lose any sort of social, you know? The the only reason that I think that there's such a bad Social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it It's like why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop Being so fucking offended if you don't have a problem with weight then don't worry about it It's not your problem What if they don't get offended for people? Why don't they just call the game? I like cake perfect Okay, because seriously if cake offends somebody then there's just no pleasing you right I like cake. I like cake a lot. I mean seriously look at me All right. Can we move on please? Loki offends me Well, guess what? What's that? Something that might not offend people. Although people always find a reason to get offended is um There's gonna be more dragon force in guitar hero 3 I I the only thing that's going to be offended is my high score With that because if the dragon force songs are as hard as the one in the game i'm going to be screwed well, the songs that some of the songs included are heroes of our time and operation ground and pound and a revolution death squad Nice, they're going to be 500. Um Microsoft points for those three Sounds like a good time. Hell. Yeah I like dragon force good stuff I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck Well one thing not coming to the playstation network anytime soon is wipeout hd Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests. The game is so hardcore. It makes people have seizures So, uh now that's offensive yeah, apparently, um I guess it's I guess it's according to uh computers and video games wipeouts h or wipeout hd's delay is because um A little bit more technical features. It's uh extra features and Apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy tests Can you imagine what would happen if sony had neglected to do that like how much poop they'd be in? In the general populace if they had like just forgot to make that kind of testing and all these kids everywhere Were having seizures because of a video game. Oh my god I guess it's a good thing. They go through all these strict tests before video games released, huh? Yeah in a way It's a good thing. They have all those seizure warnings on their manuals and stuff. That's true, too Um, anyhow the dark knight have you seen the dark knight movie? Kind of yeah kind of neat. No, I'm not going to you're not excited. I don't want to see it Why not? It wasn't bad. It was long. I've decided. I don't want to see it All right. Well your choice it is Movies are expensive these days. It's 10 bucks to go see a movie. Uh, well, they are making a video game based on the dark night, uh And yeah, I know big surprise. That's not news, right? But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps It was actually gary oldman in an interview kind of uh spilled the beans that the game was coming out And it caused this whole like little controversy where a video was out and then it was pulled and now it's out again And all this other dumb stuff not to mention that was also leaked by ign before that. Well, I mean seriously, duh There's going to be a dark knight game duh Duh, duh, they've been making batman games ever since the old nes batman game, which was actually pretty rad The old batman game was awesome. The old batman game was awesome batman returns less awesome But the original batman game was pretty awesome and there's even lego batman and all this crap anyway But um the dark knight kind of funny enough. It was not there at e3 Um, but it is still coming out and i'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the blu-ray release Uh of the movie and dvd release of the movie which will be you know in time for christmas I imagine uh gary oldman does is quoted in the video saying quote. It's hard to make a movie like this under the radar Game i'm assuming no he meant to say the movie, you know because the movie things go out But it's just kind of ironic because you know duh the game was coming right duh duh Uh So there you have it uh dark knight the game coming out soon Joy Anyway, um, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because i'm sick of hearing about it That's why I don't want to see it um What? I was gonna say It doesn't make it any worse of a movie though But I understand hype hype machine sometimes kills things and will kind of like, you know If you hear all this hype this hype this hype about something you need to watch it and you go It's good, but it's not great. And that's what a lot of people are saying about batman It's good, but it's not that great of all this hype. I didn't really care about seeing the last one either See, I just saw it at home as a batman fan I think they're far better than the schumacher films which were terrible terrible terrible These new yeah, they don't exist in my world, but these new ones not so bad In fact, really I I I thought this new one was long, but it was worth my time. It was good I agree with my husband. I won't see one until I get a soul, uh, uh a two-face only movie I don't want to say anything as a spoiler. I already know i'm just gonna back up for that But I will say this. I already know I also paid ten dollars to see mamma mia this week now that I would see And i'm going to see x files as soon as I get chance. I will only see mom. I'm sorry I'm sorry. I heard yeah, I heard the x files movies Not hot. I really don't it's fan service though. If you watch the show, you'll probably like it stay stay through the credits You don't want to miss that one. My my point is that My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it. So i'm gonna just see it for myself Fair enough. I won't see mamma mia again though until they let the audience sing along with the movie Were they Dexter game that's coming out for iphones. Do you remember us talking about that before? Um, actually, uh mark echo, um, who is a he does that clothing line and does graffiti um is actually uh supposed to be working with it, I do believe and um It's uh, his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an uh episodic content And as far as I know I do believe that uh, dextre is a a show about a serial killer Who is a uh splatter analysis for the miami police department? so, um He's uh It's a very interesting premise and I think that the the game has a good promise He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to but he doesn't want to So he kills serial killers That's extra special. It's on showtime, which means you know, it can be Which means I won't watch it Yeah, I think they've run it on cbs a couple times like during the rider strike and stuff when they needed programming But you know, it sounds like an it could be an interesting game interesting Keyword i'd just like to see it see what episodic content they're thinking of and the fact it's on the iphone of all things It's kind of it's interesting We'll see how it turns out. I guess tap here to murder Gold banjo and chat says I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome Well, no, I heard a lot of people like it. I just since I don't have show time. I don't really watch it Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment Well last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that grand theft auto 4 was coming out on the pc Well now there's even more confirmation of this first starting off with the pc gamer magazine from malaysia. Yeah, I know that's not Exactly in the us or uk or whatever, but hey, it's on the cover. So that's got to say something, right? um, so they had a big little article about that and um also there was a um, Posting which is now removed on the esrb website. Apparently no one got the memo over at um, Rockstar games about the fact that you can delay when your um posting gets listed on there Oopsie, so it's more or less coming out. Of course Rockstar games is denying that they well, they're basically telling the truth We have made no announcements regarding a pc version of grand theft auto 4 But yes, that is entirely accurate Um So, yeah, i'm sure it will be coming to pc. It's not a surprise all the like last few have so And this means hello hacking That's what i'm most interested in is all the mods for it. That'll be awesome skinning How many days let's make predictions how many days before grand theft auto 4 pc has a topless mod? Meaning all the women walk around topless 10 10 I I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves like it'll get pirated before the game's even out And somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out There you have it All right. Well also, uh coming out and uh another port that's highly anticipated although of a completely different type It's the game peggle the popcap game. That's kind of like a plinko on crack Uh, I don't know if you played this game I really enjoy it on the ipod and I bet there would be a lot of ds people who like this game as well. Um Apparently though one at one time this game was denied by popcap as existing but popcap has come around and confirmed Yes, we are making a peggle ds game and it's coming out this winter Um, that's really all there is to say about it right now. But uh, hey, it's it's popcap. It's peggle That means you could already try it out for free probably on popcap.com I think this is one of their games you can try for free and you'll have a good idea what to expect On the ds later this year and it's fun, you know for a casual game. It's a lot of fun. It's stupidly simple You just fire a ball down the little you know playing field It's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although You know pinball has ramps and you know other things that peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat I enjoy peggle. It's a great ipod game. It's almost made for the ipod So, all right This is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us This is a little segment we have here on the show called the orange lounge radio mailbag every week You guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them Right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in So let's open up ye old mailbag and dark sakura Take it away Fresh email comes from azhp Hey, olr crew with all the talk about f-zero gx being one of the greatest racers on last week's show And eager anticipation of a wii title being announced. I figured i'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately Miyamoto went on record saying he wasn't he was extremely disappointed in how sega And how sega approached f-zero gx slash ax and that if f-zero were to be made for another console It would not be in the same style as gx This is probably because it was too difficult hard confusing But in my opinion, it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos That came with playing the game even at the rookie difficulty levels The game was critically acclaimed as well received higher than um, eight over ten for most game reviewers I um, I for one love love loved f-zero gx and i'm more than excited at the thought of another f-zero game Especially in hd, but unfortunately, it probably will never come to pass Let's hope miyamoto comes to his senses and green lights this game because honestly How could anyone not like that game aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something keep up the great work in ps I went to disneyland for the first time in about 15 years and I now realize why you guys trip down there So often it really is a place where dreams come true Oh, I haven't been in like a year. So I don't have my past anymore. So Um, but yeah f-zero, I mean I I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because you know They don't think it'll work. I don't think of some stupid we feature to implement in it That'll make it worthwhile at least I hope I really hope because you know, you're right. It's critically acclaimed and uh, You know gamers that bought it loved it and I I just I hope they do it. I hope a miracle pulls through I hope a miracle pulls through i'm not going to hold my breath, but um, it would just be great Well, how about you miyamoto realize that? Maybe they should actually give gamers what they want Wasn't there actually a dsf zero after ax gx? I still thought I thought there was I I could be wrong It might have been before but I seem to remember there was one after well, um next email Um, hi, olr and this comes from ritual insomnia actually j rod. Sorry. Oops. Sorry Um, first off I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones I work 10 hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on fridays So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make one days easier I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make you guys had your e3 wrap-up show, which was great But failed to even mention a huge huge title gears of war 2 i'm absolutely stoked for this game And you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at microsoft's keynote I actually didn't think about it. Sorry, um, this puts me in a position. I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not Well, you can't get to the ferret so you can't Um, I mean you did make up for by having a discussion about the new, uh game silent hill Okay, you used game a bunch of times homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb stomping sequel How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support My uh, marcus says chainsaw dahlia. Gillespie says for me to be nice I don't know what to do with you people these emails sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks And i'll stop ripping off my signature fools Dude, seriously, it's not like I forgot about gears of war 2. I did not forget about gears of war 2 a lot of news I just didn't care. I honestly didn't fucking care. I hated gears of war 1 and gears of war 2. Guess what? I'm, not buying it and to be honest. I mean there's enough news out there Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of you know gears of war 2? No, I don't need to because guess what we didn't talk about every single demo that they have there. I mean, seriously I'm loling because i'm looking at the show roll and I see what story we have coming out of the mailbag tonight That's funny. Well that that is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty of them It is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty about gears of war 2 prior to that show. So That's what I had to say who gives a crap Well, bobby bobby makes a good point though in chat. He says gears of war 2 wasn't really at e3 It was just at the keynote He says gears of war 2 will be playable at packs half of microsoft's booth will be gears 2 So even though we did have the playthrough at packs, you know, not a lot of people or I mean i'm sorry at the e3 Keynote we didn't have a lot of people. Um get hands-on impressions of the game and you know for for somebody like me Who's not quite as into that series? There's not a lot for me to say other than well It looks like the first one but better a little bit But I don't know I I know there were a lot of actually there were a lot of non-shooting people that were really into gears Of war 2 so who knows i'll give it a go I will give gears of war 2 a go, but i'm not going to buy it the day It comes out like I did gears of war 1, but I will check it out through a friend or something I'll make lowkey loamy his copy if he even buys it or something or I guess i'll just have to get a gamefly account I don't know But I just realized there was a lot a lot of e3 news next week some things fell through the cracks Next email, um, good sunday evening to you. Olr. I trust that. Everyone's been having a nice week so far Anyways, i'd like to say i'm kind of slow on catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my ipod Anymore, I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for olr Since the newer episodes are seven are 70 megabytes now i'm struggling to make ends meet on my ipod very nice format though When I heard the news about final fantasy 13 Being a 360 release as well. I tried thinking of ps3 exclusives While the first party fair have been from decent, um motorstorm to best games i've ever played metal gear solid 4 I've yet to see many good third-party games. Hayes doesn't count Um, what i'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the ps3 by releasing original innovative games Not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for dlc ports Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off or is it the fact that more people own 360s? But I first can't wait for the naruto ps3 game coming out in october though One last thing with the addition of butterfly and ww and ddrx. I think that konami has gone too far and reminiscing um I mean sure those are a couple of the best songs ddr has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated Uh, the additions are like a slutty girlfriend. She may be nice and all but who hasn't done her That's funny. I mean any ddr player has played butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right? Why add it in a console version now? Well, that's all I have to say For the past few weeks and e3 while disappointing for some did have some very high points until next time katamari's forever This message brought to you by kenya home of the never-ending american ip addresses Well, i'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy Um, you know, obviously there's always gonna people love the idea and some people that don't like the idea I I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your ipod to make it work. I hope one way or another so That's what i'll have to say the rest of it, you know Good thoughts That's it there's more okay Um greetings everyone ron may uh here live from the laundromat show and some heart. Are you at the laundromat right now? No Yeah, well, no looking at the time Before I begin there's a few things i'd like to say to dark sakura Um, i've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit I truly loved and enjoyed everything words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality When you come to nyc, I will give that back to you a thousand fold. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you To rob. I wish we had more time to hang out not enough Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago and fyi Part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show As I said before when you come to new york city, I will give you that back Give that back to you a thousand fold because you're so fabulous To loki you're all right in my book too bad. We didn't get a chance to talk more and Uh and be more chill you were supposed to come join me and jamie for lunch Yeah, I did call you a couple times Um, I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay when you come out here to new york city I will show you a damn good time now on to some other things Oh, wow, this is a long email, sorry um I've said in the past. It would not surprise me that square enix would put final fantasy 12. He said 12 I guess maybe means 13, um on xbox 360. Thank you screen x for saving my roommate 400 on a paperweight I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason I feel that konami will put metal gear solid 4 on the xbox 360 I'm not saying that because i'm a drooling fanboy, but from a financial point of view The money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the ps3 due to the fact that it has A lower consumer home base and then the 360 that that was the point actually I agree with I'm putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles And speaking of konami people are calling for others to not support konami as a sad reality I understand where you're coming from about this though The whole lawsuit with konami versus viacom is not konami's fault You have to blame ad division about this because they're the ones paying licensing fees to them for guitar hero Everyone is saying that konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides bemani Konami has other titles such as will castlevania contra metal gear solid to name a few Also konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list um I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it. I like the gameplay screens And what annoys me more is that bemani fanboys girls Are going to foam at the mouth because of no guitar freaks drummania tracks in the game If konami added a lot of those tracks They would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game That's my two cents on it Any who keep up the good work and don't stop believing This email is brought to you by joey pisanos on mulberry street in the heart of little italy home of the 595 lunch specials You'll love pisanos And also by anime jam sessions the newest anime cosplay podcast cheap plug. Yep um Yeah, uh I I I like what black hole is saying in chat right now I'm, just reading does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see because that's one of the symbols No, I I don't agree with him that If you put some bow mai tracks in there that alienate, you know The people that were gonna buy it or whatever. Um, I mean look at some of the tracks that they have in guitar hero That are unlockables like their bonus tracks that are non-life either independent artists or you know, um at the time harmonics, um Artists like kind of like freeze pop and stuff. I mean i'm pretty sure freeze pop isn't main, you know A mainstream artist that everybody would love. I mean because some people find them annoying like me um And so some of the guitar hero tracks or guitar freaks tracks could easily be unlockable songs in that but no That would be you know Trying to even incorporate their old audience into it. Oh, well that That would be awful. I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game Whereas the other people may not buy your game. So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already To buy that game On the other topic. I agree with his reasoning for the final fantasy 13 on the xbox 360 It just makes sense that they want to get up make sure they get all the development costs back By making sure they get a good share of the u.s marketplace Um marketplace, um, although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a playstation 3 Just to get it for final fantasy. Um, 13 myself being one of them But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it So there you have it Any more emails tonight one one more Hey, olr Hi, i've been thinking about starting to play world of warcraft But the 15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget I would like everyone's opinion on whether it is whether or not it is worth The fee is guild wars or another mmorpg without a fee a viable alternative I heard that there are free private servers for world of warcraft as well. Are these legitimate? No They're not very good time. Keep on keeping on seth um I honestly world of warcraft. I got very burned on it very quickly I suggest if you can find like a a trial Try out a trial of it, you know, see how you like it But guild wars I think will be better for your money If you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already Or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free, uh, ragnarok online server I I agree though that guild wars is a viable alternative to world of warcraft. I mean, it's different You can't you can't say they're the same game because they're not the way they you know at glance They look the same and even at first kind of when you're first playing them You're like, oh there's a lot of similarities, but kind of the way the end game works is much different I mean guild wars is really, you know about guilds warring in the in the kind of final end stages There's only 20 levels in the game after all, um kind of a little more pvp-ish But I do think uh, you know warcraft is a lot of fun Obviously i've been playing it for a long long time But I mean if that's really all your gaming budget really going to warcraft in that case Um, I I would agree check out a demo you can get a demo for two dollars or if you know anybody Uh that is already in warcraft hell if you email me i'll get you a freaking code so you can download a 10-day demo Uh any player in the game can has access to be able to do it through the warcraft website And you can download the client online so Very very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game and you know, I I actually I sort of had the thought of uh, Giving it one more go myself I mean I got really annoyed with it and but I figured if I you know And this is what I always do is that I play for a couple months and quit again so I guess being in school. I'm not gonna really have a whole lot of time to play but I was thinking of Maybe giving it another go just it got really boring blood elves are hot. They are But it got really boring Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time. Yeah, it was. Oh, I couldn't remember I couldn't remember. I had just upgraded. Oh, wow. Okay. Remember? Yeah, that's right. I remember I remember. Yeah All right So that's it for the email then All right If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launcher trader.com is the place to send those emails For now loki is going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic. Yes Uh, how ironic all of this, uh gears of war 2 There's some new things been announced about it including that they're going to have some content For gears of war 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from gears of war 1 And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had. So that's kind of neat And also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for halo 3 which will be the 130 lancer bundle that will come with a Lancer, um, yes a miniature replica model of a lancer. What game is this again? Gears of war 2 i'm getting gears of war 2 It's not the same kind of lancer that you're thinking of. It's a chainsaw gun I still want one All right, I like everything lancer, what about the whole achievements thing The whole achievements thing. Yeah. Yeah, I mentioned that. Oh, sorry. I spaced for a minute I don't know. What do you think of it though? It's an achievement horn. I think that's kind of cool Yeah, I think it's something they should implement in other games. It will get you to buy Some of their older games like gears of war especially for the achievement horror in all of this exactly you make the announcement now They just released that gears of war refresh time to buy your copy of that for like 39.99 And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff. They used to do that kind of with um, Burnout actually remember um burnout like uh, three and stuff like that. They used to burn out revenge actually did this Um, if you had a game save for burnout 3 you got a car from burnout 3 and then also if you had a madden save Um, you got the madden van In burnout so interesting. I don't understand why they don't do this more often. But yeah, whatever All right Um Cool, I like the idea Uh, but I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements But one game I am definitely considering buying is mortal combat versus dc universe because I actually like mortal combat quite a bit And as even though i'm not as huge into comic books as some other people Um, I think the dc universe characters are pretty good and you know tons of people have joker fever right now because of you know The new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on lots of people Uh loving the joker right now And so it just was fitting that this week at comic con It was announced that the joker has been added to the roster of characters for mortal combat versus dc universe Also, though it didn't stop there jax and katana from the mortal combat side are both confirmed for the game Which I think are kind of must-haves especially katana. Um, jax is a really cool character, too So i'm glad they have him there. Um also from the dc comics world green lantern is also going to be in the game That could be pretty cool. Maybe seals. So there you have it Um, now the question is since uh villains Supposedly could have fatalities even though heroes count because the whole dc comics rules could the joker kill people in the game I don't know I I don't I think even if their fatalities are going to be really um kind of softened down. You're not going to see any head ripping honestly If it's the joker You don't know what he's going to do I think that if they give him fatalities they either should or shouldn't go off at random Like like if he pulled out a gun it either blow their head off or like punch him with a big fist or something Nice idea. I like that or like say bang because this is the joker you don't know what he's going to do He does this to freak you out That's a good idea. That would that would be very joker and then you know, you could get like bang bang bang You know three things in a row and right when you think oh, it's not gonna happen. Boom headshot. So uh game guru, uh Uh, um hypothesizes the joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room. Um Zennane chat says jax was booed when he first came up at the panel. That's sad. Jax is cool He has mental arms because they he he's got his own fatality done on him somehow Oh I would like to say that I have some interesting news. Oh, really Yes, really and this makes me quite happy Um, although i'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned. Um, well that we don't have in show role But ties into this, uh, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago um there is actually um a rumor stating, um, and this actually, uh was going on at a san diego comic con 08, um marvel studios president of production Um was saying, uh, well, they were actually asked if there would be another marvel versus capcom and he said yes And maybe sooner than you think So, but the other thing i've been reading is that when and you know, i've covered this on the show before um, Tatsunoko versus capcom which by the way, there's more stuff out more characters in it including a hurricane polymer kashan gachiman um The robot one I can never remember the name of um tekkeman And for for anyone who's like and also batsu is in it from rival schools. Um, uh, morrigan, um, just a bunch of you know characters But going back to the the marvel, uh versus capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um, the current test machines being out In japan for tatsunoko versus capcom that marvel was sort of like, uh, we want to make money off of this again Since you've got this brand new shiny fighting game engine. We want to use it, please Except we're sort of licensed out right now, but it would still be nice Please Aj mixx wants to see some power stone characters There actually from what I understand they have a uh for tatsunoko versus capcom And actually if you give me a second i'll get the character list for you real quick Um, the actual full trailer of for tatsunoko versus capcom is actually up on um youtube right now You can find it easy just looking up tatsunoko versus capcom, but give me just a quick sec I just think the whole thing is interesting. I I this always makes me laugh how you have, you know The street fighter and mortal combat were always kind of like these two, you know competing franchises in the fighting game world And you have dc comics and and marvel or the two in the comic world It's just really funny how the cards fell and you always have marvel versus capcom and now you have mortal combat versus dc Finally after kind of all these years when you would think this team-up would have happened a while sooner Okay, so far I don't have the the full list of everything. Um, okay here's what we have so far for the list of tatsunoko Versus capcom characters. We have um, awashi no ken who is a g1 for gachaman. Um, kashan from uh, The kashan anime tekaman from tekaman the space knight yataman number one from yachaman hurricane polymer and uh gold light on from golden warrior gold light on and from um, Capcom, there's ryu chun li batsu from rival schools alex from street fighter 3 morgan from um Darkstalkers and silky from onimusha dawn of dreams So it's actually on location test. Um in tokyo right now. Um, And hopefully i've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more. Um, As far as an actual release date soon. In fact, i'm pulling up another Uh list here that they're saying a december 2008 actual release window. So that's fairly cool I hope they they add more characters, though I really do but the poster though seems to be pretty finalized the one that they've got out now All right, i'm just surprised I I want speed racer as a hidden character That was a tatsunoko production thing Lord katsuhito in chat says tatsunoko versus capcom could come to the u.s. It just depends on who holds what license to which tatsunoko anime Still is going to be a pain in the ass though, you know either way So, you know what? I i'm gonna import it no matter what so got to You love gachaman and all those other characters. I I would not that news does not surprise me one bit All right, um, well if you have been following core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the playstation network You'll probably have figured out that If you have purchased the I want to say the august version of core and whatever one just came out You'll actually be able to get into the Resistance 2 beta this september and um, also there will be some other ways to get in besides that According to my resistance dot net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game And they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access But if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new naruto game But you get into um the resistance beta Huh I I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing. That's been very popular lately, you know Whatever happened to the good old, uh fashions, you know sign up for it You know, it doesn't go out to the public at all. It's just friends and family, even that. I don't know, it's a little silly. The pain for demos have been around for a long time. Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation Magazine to get your demo disc? Doesn't mean I like it. Doesn't mean I like it one bit. Do you, will you sign up for, you like Resistance, will you sign up for a core membership? No, because it's a 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer. I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested. Well, then there you go. All right, well, I think we need to get, give out an award for stupidity. Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that. It's much easier this week. It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC. Congratulations, you're the wiener of the stupid award this week. Here's why. It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle. Now, I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle, as long as they use, you know, figures or sales or even history, for God's sake. I don't care, but here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war. It's because her son said so. Her 16-year-old son said so. He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened. He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed. After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4 as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline and the awesomeness of Blu-ray, he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in. As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you at the PlayStation. Neither did I, he replied. Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that, that he kept on top of all the stuff going on in the industry. I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out. I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion. I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact, kind of. I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war. I don't know. Either way, it's retarded. And this shouldn't be reported on CNBC. Which is Financial Investor Network. That's the problem I have with it. And the whole thing sounds like a big old, you know, I want a PSP for Christmas thing. Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next. Music I would like to say F you to whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition. My grandmom is in the hospital right now. It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that. I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her. And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, in other people. And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on. So, you know, I guess genetics, too, have something to do with it. But I just, you know, F you to the fact that my grandmom's in the hospital, that there's something wrong that required her to be there in the first place. Well, I hope she gets better. Well, I'm sure she will. She's going in for surgery on Tuesday. And I'll tell you guys more often. Sure, that's fine. Alright, Loki. F you to people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people. Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use? And I'm like, no. I don't own a cell phone at all. So, get the fuck off. That's it. Speaking of genetics, I guess I'm going to also give a similar F you tonight because it looks more and more likely that I am going to have my gallbladder taken out later this year as part of the reason why I have my whole pancreas issues in the first place. And although it's not a big deal, a lot of people have had it done. It's pretty common right now. It just... surgery sucks. Period. So, I'm not looking forward to that. And that means that I am going to be out of Orange Lawn's radio for probably two weeks at some time in the fall. I don't know when, but that will be coming up where I'm not going to be able to do the show for a couple weeks. So, it's too early to speak to what's going to happen during that period, but it's going to happen. So, wait for it. F you to that. Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news. DarkSakura, what you got for us? Come next. Oh, just some stuff. Cool. I like stuff. Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked? Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock remixes are actually going to be... And this is just going to give me a second, because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze. But some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remix. At least as far as I can see on here. So, I think that's pretty cool. They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on their remixes. DJ Pretzel, we've actually had a few of the stuff on here. Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley, I guess I don't see a nickname for him, but I think that's pretty cool. They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the game itself. I agree, that is pretty cool. Kudos to Capcom. You're doing a lot of stuff right this year. Good for you. I figured it out. Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon. You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month. Well now, what if it's Nintendo holding onto it? What if it's Nintendo's fault? Oh wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault. That's just lies. That's what I thought. But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures. Players of course will be able to control both animated characters and hilarity will ensue from there. No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series. So, that's kind of neat. Episodic gaming is the wave of the future. Hey, over at Telltale, yeah, that's kind of where they make their bread and butter. But you know you're in good hands over there, so that's going to be very interesting I think. Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to our Skype line at www.orangelaungeradio.com. Click on interact with us for all the details. It's OrangeLaungeRadio is our username on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR. But first, one last story, and it has to do for those of you guys, you know, if you are in the OL Army on Facebook, then maybe you're a Scrabulous player. But the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally. Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game. Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January. So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on the folks that have created the Scrabulous game and is demanding that Facebook pull the application immediately. They even put out a whole little press release on it. It should be noted, one interesting part I kind of liked in the press release here is it says, between the classic board game, Facebook, Pogo, the iPod, and the iPhone, our members can now play their favorite game virtually anytime, anywhere. Alluding to the fact that there is an actual Scrabble application on Facebook that people seem to not be using as much. Maybe because Scrabulous was already kind of out there at the time. So, I mean, the lawsuit kind of makes sense, I hate to say it, but if you've played Scrabulous, it's Scrabble. There's no denying that. But at the same time, it got old. Like, I know there's a lot of people that play Scrabulous on Facebook. I played it like once or twice, and I'm like, okay, bored now. I mean, Scrabble's fun, I think, in person, but not quite as fun over the internet for me. That's just my opinion. Are you a Scrabulous player at Dark Sakura? Sometimes. Yeah? Alright, that's cool. I mean, it's a fun word game, but I don't know, it got old for me. It's always the same people I want to play to. And then, you know, when I first installed the application, I got like all these invites to play a game, and I just, you know, I can only handle like one game at a time, alright? Alright. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. The Skype line is now open for business. Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? Hey, it's LordKatsuhito. Is it now? What, you changed the name tonight? Are you referring to that in the Jedi sense? Maybe. Do not start singing the Bughram song. So, Rama, you already had an email read tonight. This phone call better be good. What's up? I want to talk about Fat Princess. I want to discuss this game, okay? Please do. That alone makes me want to drop the 400 bucks for a PlayStation 3. Really? Why? The game looks fun. I'm sorry. It looks fun. I've spent money on frivolous things, but that'd be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game. And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up. I mean, really. Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure. Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360. Not the sole reason, but a big reason. I would say Xbox Live in general was. It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way. Sure, go for it. The feminists are bitching them on about Fat Princess? I mean, where were they when all these games were coming out where the hero had to go rescue their heroine? Where were they? They didn't say Jack. They said nothing. Now the game with a fat cat, now they run their mouths? Feminists, gaming feminists are a bunch of fucking hypocrites. That's it. I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times. Why not? Why not? Just kind of throwing that idea out there. And then roll her over one of those switches in the dungeon to solve a puzzle. No, no, no. You know what, though? I would like to see more. Why not? If we're going to go for diversity in this sense, let's go for diversity all around the board. But this just goes into the whole fact where we need more gay people in games, we need more people of color in games, we need, you know. There's a simple solution. Everyone, get over it. Be more open-minded. I'm never going to stop playing games, but it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like to's, and I'll still play Fat Princess. No. Alright, any other thoughts, Rama? Don't stop believing. Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be. Let's see, comments in chat. GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur. Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke, let it be. You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it, this offends me, and then bitch. I don't like it, this offends me. Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easy going and go with the goddamn flow? I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things. Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work. That's a good thing, you know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like. You don't have to have a hissy. Just say, I don't like this, and then get over it. You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something, I don't know. Some comments in chat, SSJ100Matt says, maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles. Why do you think she wears that dress? Um, Shaoran, it's a slimming dress. Shaoran says, we need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this? Nah, it's Legend of Zaku. Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind? Uh, nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all. Yesterday's what party? Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, masses of rock band, lots of booze. I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party? Because you don't have a party without rock band. Alright, then it officially was a party. Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band. And I left after an hour and a half. But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia. And that got me to stay as long as I did. Because lumpia, good stuff. Anyway, sorry Zaku, I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food. What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight? Well, let me see, the whole, I'm trying to think right now. The fact of the matter that, you know, Street Fighter IV and, you know, the state of the arcades in this country. The fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machine. But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore. Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami. And, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too. I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven? And DDR of course, they a little more forgiven? Well, that's DDR, that's an exception. You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades. And then all of a sudden, you know, especially in America, you know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved. I would say true statement because Street Fighter II, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades. It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo. It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge, 15 years ago even. And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, doing, making efforts to, like, help. Instead of, you know, instead of just beating around the budget saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only. How come these arcade, here's a question, how come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades? I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades. I wonder why not. Well, think about it, it's a risk. You see the current state of, you know, the current state of the economy right now and how gas is, like, ridiculously expensive. People are trying to save as much money as possible. So, the first things to go in tough times like these is entertainment. I guess I can see that. And the fact that, you know, the consoles have pretty much given, you know, given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out. Because they're out doing the graphics. I guess I can see that. Well, I don't know, what do you think the answer is? When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever? What's it going to take? It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. That's a good saying. It takes effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games. Capcom, Konami, you know, the others. They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades. The ones that are struggling just to get by. At least help them out a little bit. Alright. Zaku, anything else you want to share with listeners tonight? Um, let me see. Yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole, you know, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it. It's done. It's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference. Like, you were going to buy it anyways. I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it. Here in the studio. I know, it's like old news, I'm thinking of that, I should have brought it yesterday. It's alright. Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse. It's alright. Just to remind you it's dead. Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go. Have a good one, buddy. Bye. Later. Oh, it's some New York, it's New York night on the Skypline. That was two New Yorkers in a row. Yep. I haven't been to New York in a while. It's been at least a year. It's time for me to go back. It's been about 12 years for me. You need to go. We need to, we need to storm the big city. Be fun. Literally storm through it. As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it. We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there. We'll see. Someday. If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon. But first, some more calls. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? It's GS68 and I just broke the streak of New York gamers. You're not from New York. No, what's up? Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it. One way to do that would be to lower game prices because these days, what typical gamer in the right mind would pay more than 25 or 50 cents to play an arcade game? Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much. But isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive? I suppose. I mean, as much in... I hate to bring in Minnesota again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs. I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know? But then everybody would know it's a budget cab and people would go, oh, this one's lame. It's not as good as the other one. You know what an awesome cab was? It was F-Zero AX. That was a brilliant cabinet. That was so fun. Yeah, but look at time crisis for the majority of like the cab... time crisis for cabinets are small cabinets and people don't have a big problem with that. Yeah. I don't know. Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom? And then, what else? I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games like in the 70s and 80s. Nowadays, it's the other way around. I mean, could you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that? You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face. A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else. That would be something. Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down. That'd be fun. Well, some good arcadets going to the arcade is in itself a unique experience. I mean, at home you'd have to bring friends over to have a huge ass party. And then there's online, but there's something about meeting your opponents in person that online doesn't have. Hmm. I suppose. Alright. Uh, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go? Um, no. Alright. Have a good one, buddy, and good luck. I hope the arcades do come full circle someday. Alright. Thank you. Buh-bye. Because I miss arcades too, you know. 877-GameOLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We'll do one more call tonight. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this? Hi, this is Akdeft. Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind, buddy? Oh, I have, uh, news here about, uh, a guy who marathoned, like, 26 hours and a half, uh, playing the drums on rock band. He played rock band drums for 26 hours and- 26 and a half hours? Did his arm fall off? Um, fortunately, not. Wow, is he playing on hard mode? He was playing on expert. Uh, he's actually a freak from the score hero forums. He's a staff member there. Uh. What did- what was the point? Was it charity or what? Just have fun, basically. He- he did, uh, something for charity, though. Uh, it wasn't that, um, how do you say it? Big? Because they- he only got to, like, $200. Well, still, charity's charity. That's still pretty cool, though. Um, and speaking of charity and these marathon things, man, they're happening- thanks to sites like Justin.tv and Ustream and all these other sites, man, it seems like there's a gaming charity event happening every weekend somewhere. In fact, I actually visited a website, and I'm sorry, I don't remember the URL, but I'm sure someone in chat will jump in there with it. There's actually a website out there somewhere, like, it's like gamemarathons.com or something, that show you, hey, these are all the marathons going on this weekend if you want to go watch people play some games. Kind of interesting. I think it's more fun to play games, but then at the same time, I've always thought we here at OLR should do one of those for fun one time. Like, I think a fun game tournament that we- or not game tournament, game marathon we should do, is that- and I think this was kind of an idea we talked about kind of a little bit in circle on the show, is go to Jamie's, and in her big game archive, we'll pick games, and every hour, the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next, but they're, like, obscure shit. Like, no Mario, no Zelda. What the hell do you think I have in the vault? Exactly, we're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault, is what we would play all marathon long. Do you think people would be into that? Yeah, that would be cool. I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out. I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you. Yes, that too. But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off. We'll have to think about it. Maybe for- if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend, maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something, I don't know. Just throwing ideas out there. Some three day weekend, we'll have to see. Basically, the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh cool, sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band. And it makes me kind of pissed because even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure playing Expert, all the songs, even the download continent, so it's like- I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and whatever website ran stories on this and whatever. My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror. You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills. No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band. If you think you're any better than the guy playing rock band, guess what? You're worse. The end. Indeed, I agree with that. There is no counter argument to that. You are worse than the guy playing rock band, which, you know what, if it makes him happy, I think he, play it for 48 hours next time. I support it. He did say that he might try on December to do that again with all the download continent that is going to be released until then. So that would be cool. Alright, act deft. Thank you so much for the call and party on with rock band. Take a good one. Have a good one, buddy. Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories. Dark Soccer by chance? I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors? And apparently there's even video now. Apparently, you know how Darth Vader was supposed to be exclusive to PlayStation 3 Soul Calibur? Apparently not. Apparently, he's actually showing up in videos now for the 360 version and vice versa. So, because you know people are breaking street on that and everything. So, kind of not a big surprise honestly, but it looks like Vader will be playable after all in 360 and vice versa for Yoda and the PS3. Now you might have to pay for download content, but it's available. It's available. Loki, anything for you? I don't think I have really much of anything. There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground. It kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious. Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake. So, that's kind of interesting. Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2. Talk about stunt casting. Really, I just think they want some of the big tits on their cover. I support that fully. Let's see here. Don't care. Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st and what's kind of cool about it is it will have the character creator with it and you can actually share those characters that you create online and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September. So, that's kind of neat. Let's see. Yeah, I think that's about it. Amazeatsuma in chat has a good point. Says, Sky paid for download content. It's Namco so it will be paid to unlock content. It's old caliber. You're probably right. BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader. I'll just pay $60. Okay, thanks. Well, I'll pay $60 and then maybe the $10 and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with. Just messing. Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun. But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio. I will start tonight. And my final thought is I want a snack. I want snacky foods. Yogurt. I want frozen yogurt. That would be really good. Oh my God, Rob. That's not really good. That's my final thought too. I want frozen yogurt. Let's go get some. We can't. They all close at nine. Well, screw that. Let's go to the grocery store. I do need to go to the grocery store though. Loki, your final thought? I don't know. I don't have anything. Alright. Wow. OLR PSP is still being worked on. I just have a lot of small things I haven't finished. But it is, I've been working on it quite heavily so soon. Alright. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and downloading our podcast. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask if you enjoy the show, you hear. If you like what you're hearing, we are an independent podcast. We do not have thousands of marketing dollars. In fact, we have zero dollars to work with. We don't have a big magazine backing us or a big gaming website or anything. We really struggle to connect with viewers like you. So please tell two people you know about the show and slowly through word of mouth, Orange Lawns Radio will spread like a bad STD. But a lot nicer to have. So anyway, thank you guys so much for listening to us. We'll see you next week with more of what you've come to love here on Orange Lawns Radio. And again, if you are listening on the podcast, you want to leave some comments, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or leave us a voicemail which we still need to catch up on or post on our website at the forums at OrangeLawnsRadio.com. Until then, this is Rob, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we are Orange Lawns Radio. See you next week.
