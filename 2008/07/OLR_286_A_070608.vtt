00:00.000 --> 00:21.280
Tonight, July 6th, 2008, a 16-bit RPG classic is being redone for the DS, Rock Band 2 leaks

00:21.280 --> 00:31.560
at the internet, and could a popular racing game soon take on airplanes?

00:31.560 --> 00:35.560
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.560 --> 00:36.560
Radio.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.680
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:41.680 --> 00:42.680
lifestyle.

00:42.680 --> 00:43.880
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.920
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:47.920 --> 00:48.920
Hi.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.320
How are you, Jamie?

00:50.320 --> 00:51.600
I don't know.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.560
It's very, very hot here in the studio in Sacramento.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.320
I swear if it gets above like 100, the little temperature thing he says is 99 degrees right

01:00.320 --> 01:01.320
now.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.200
If we were to hit 100, we would have to call a heat day, I think.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
Yeah.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.800
It's just very crazy.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.320
But we're doing what we can to cool off down here in studio, but it's kind of a mess tonight.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.520
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

01:15.520 --> 01:20.360
See, my computer room's normally about this temperature anyways because of, you know,

01:20.360 --> 01:21.360
my high end computer.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.840
It blows out so much hot air.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.000
Even with the air conditioning on, it's a good 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
house.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
All right.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.400
And then if I'm like recording video on my Xbox 360, that being as small as it is still

01:33.400 --> 01:36.720
kicks out about as much heat too, so that really sucks.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.280
All right.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.840
Well, we've got lots and lots and lots of people here in studio tonight, and it's kind

01:42.840 --> 01:46.960
of strange because, like, you know, we have our six year anniversary of Orange Orleans

01:46.960 --> 01:48.920
Radio and frickin' nobody shows up.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.320
We have a visitor come in from out of town, suddenly my garage is frickin' full, standing

01:52.320 --> 01:53.320
room only.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
What the hell is this?

01:54.320 --> 01:55.320
All right.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.720
So say hello tonight in order of importance.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.280
Say hello first off to Intern Drew.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.280
What's up?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.280
How you doing, Drew?

02:02.280 --> 02:03.280
I'm doing pretty good.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
All right.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.280
I gotta make sure.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.280
Are we hearing Intern Drew tonight?

02:06.280 --> 02:07.280
I don't know.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.280
Are we hearing Intern Drew?

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
Yes, I think we are.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
Barely, although that's very quiet.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.280
I don't know.

02:11.280 --> 02:12.280
Do I have the sensitive mic tonight?

02:12.280 --> 02:13.280
Maybe I do.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.280
I don't know.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.280
Do I have the sensitive mic?

02:15.280 --> 02:16.280
I don't know.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.280
I don't know.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.280
Maybe I do.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.280
Live radio.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.280
We're doing sound checks live on air.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
What can you do?

02:21.280 --> 02:22.280
Sound check one, two.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.280
All right.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.280
Anyhow.

02:24.280 --> 02:25.280
Look, when I talk, it makes little lines up here.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.280
Exactly.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.280
That's the magic of radio.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.280
You haven't figured that out after six years?

02:28.280 --> 02:29.280
All right.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.920
Also, say hello tonight to our website master.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.800
Dark Tetsuya is here in studio.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.800
Amazing.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.800
Yeah, I know.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.800
I made it.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.240
You live in town, and yet you never seem to make it over here, but here you are tonight.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.560
Well, Drew said he was going to come and get me yesterday, so.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.560
Awesome.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.560
Here I am.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
All right.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.560
Well, Dark Tetsuya is here.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.560
We'll get him a little louder.

02:50.560 --> 02:52.360
We're going to give him some mic lessons a little later.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.360
It's all good.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.360
It's been a while.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.560
So he'll be here to comment on some of the news tonight, and then say hello to the one

02:57.560 --> 03:05.920
and only joining us for all the way from New York freaking city, DJ Rama S is here in studio.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
What's up, people?

03:06.920 --> 03:07.920
How you doing?

03:07.920 --> 03:08.920
Hot.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.280
Yeah, I know.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.520
It doesn't look that hot when you see it on Justin TV.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.520
Does it?

03:13.520 --> 03:15.940
No, but funny thing is I should be used to this heat, but still.

03:15.940 --> 03:17.160
It's really bad tonight.

03:17.160 --> 03:20.280
Like, we may have to take a heat break in the middle of part A just to kind of like

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
cool.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.280
I'm serious.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.280
Like, it's sad.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.280
Don't laugh at me.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.280
Huh?

03:25.280 --> 03:26.280
We'll have to get the Gatorade.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.280
Seriously.

03:27.280 --> 03:28.280
It's pretty bad in here tonight.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.240
And I don't want Jamie to die live on air.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.240
That would be horrific.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.000
I don't want to die on air either.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Yeah.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
So we might take a heat break in the middle of part A.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
I want to die on bacon.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.160
Alright, say hello as well.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.680
The good news is, since we broadcast at six o'clock, you know, the heat reaches its peak

03:45.680 --> 03:48.920
around five o'clock, so it should be cooling off, thankfully, throughout the night.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.260
Alright, say hello as well to, um, well, wait.

03:51.260 --> 03:54.600
I guess we're not in order of importance anymore, because she'd be on the bottom of the list.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
Rice Princess!

03:55.600 --> 03:58.400
Wait, aren't I on the bottom anyway?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.960
Aren't I the last person?

03:59.960 --> 04:00.960
I don't know.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.960
I'm just messing with you.

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
Shut your face, Rob.

04:02.960 --> 04:03.960
Alright.

04:03.960 --> 04:04.960
How are you, Miss Princess?

04:04.960 --> 04:05.960
Mad at you now.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.960
No, you love me.

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
No, I don't.

04:07.960 --> 04:08.960
Alright.

04:08.960 --> 04:09.960
Alright.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.960
So we have a very full house tonight, just lots and lots of people to comment on the

04:12.960 --> 04:19.280
news tonight, and of course, you, in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, we got lots

04:19.280 --> 04:23.360
of people in chat tonight, we have stickax282, who says, I'm kind of new here to this whole

04:23.360 --> 04:24.360
live thing.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.280
Boy, did you pick a shitty show to have as your first show, because it's gonna be chaotic

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
tonight.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.280
Um, but welcome.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.360
Shadow Charlie says, holy crap, it's Rama.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.360
Holy crap indeed.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.360
There it is.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.040
Jamie says, somebody dying live on air sounds exciting.

04:39.040 --> 04:43.480
You know, I think it's one of those things that's better when you're at home watching,

04:43.480 --> 04:47.560
but if you're like, live in studio, and considering the fact it's Jamie, and it would kinda, like,

04:47.560 --> 04:49.000
I don't want Jamie to die.

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
I mean, Jamie said some things that have made me angry before, but I don't want her to die.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.720
Heart.

04:58.720 --> 05:01.960
I guess Jamie has died, and the ferret has taken over tonight.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
Alright.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.880
No, Jamie is alive and very well, and wants to talk to you all about her gaming week.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.520
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

05:08.520 --> 05:11.520
Um, I played Black Knight 2000.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.200
It's imbalanced, but I managed to replay on my first ball, and that's the only time I've

05:15.200 --> 05:19.640
ever done well on that game in my life.

05:19.640 --> 05:23.640
I also played pinball at the House of Dark Soccer this week, and your pinball machines

05:23.640 --> 05:26.080
like made it or something, it's like they grew.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.280
It's been crazy.

05:27.280 --> 05:36.200
We moved the wide bodies out into the garage, and we have both the Black Knight machines

05:36.200 --> 05:46.640
inside, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Simpsons Pinball Party, No Fear, and World

05:46.640 --> 05:50.160
Cup Soccer in the house, and everything else that's outside.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.240
Dan's working on our friend's Indiana Jones machine.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.640
Yeah, I was gonna say, when I was there, I saw an Indiana Jones machine that was being

05:55.640 --> 05:56.640
worked on.

05:56.640 --> 06:00.840
Yes, I actually ate a cookie off the Indiana Jones machine, it was pretty awesome.

06:00.840 --> 06:03.000
It was very delicious.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
They were mint cookies.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.880
Yes, it was very delicious.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Orange Lounge Fudio!

06:06.880 --> 06:11.880
Alright, anything else that you played with your week?

06:11.880 --> 06:12.960
Any de-essing?

06:12.960 --> 06:16.600
I played traffic a lot, and I played Getting Lost to San Francisco.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.600
You played in traffic?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.640
I played driving.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.240
A lot of people tell me to go play in traffic, but I've never actually played in traffic.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.440
I played Initial D, for real.

06:25.440 --> 06:29.080
No, it was on the freeway, so it was more like one gun.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.080
Awesome.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.080
Awesome.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.400
Alright, let's go around the studio and see what everybody else has been playing.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.680
I will start with the guests tonight, I'll be nice, and Loki and I will go last.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.120
Who has the mic for you kids over there?

06:41.120 --> 06:44.240
Rice Princess, since you were on the bottom last time, why don't you start off, how was

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
your gaming week?

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
Non-existent.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.240
Next.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.240
Wow, you're boring.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.820
Alright, Rama, how was your gaming week?

06:49.820 --> 06:50.820
It was tolerable.

06:50.820 --> 06:57.840
I played Super Mario Kart DS on the plane ride coming in, and throughout the week on

06:57.840 --> 07:03.120
the subway, I was playing Custom Robo Arena, which has really become one of my favorite

07:03.120 --> 07:04.120
games.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.120
Interesting.

07:05.120 --> 07:10.400
Tell us a little bit about Custom Robo Arena, I don't think I've ever heard of it.

07:10.400 --> 07:15.800
Well, basically, Custom Robo Arena is like a Pokemon-ish type game, where you get this

07:15.800 --> 07:19.240
little cube as a robot, and you customize it with different parts, and you battle with

07:19.240 --> 07:20.240
it.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.760
And one part of the style is like cleaning up your robot, because throughout the game,

07:23.760 --> 07:26.880
if you're running around with a dirty robot, nobody wants to fight with you.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.160
Is it like a Tamagotchi, where it'll poop randomly and you have to clean it up?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.160
Mm-hmm.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.800
Sounds awesome.

07:32.800 --> 07:33.800
Sounds very awesome.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.520
Not bad for $9.99, so hey.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.520
There you go.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.240
There you go.

07:38.240 --> 07:42.640
What is this, Rama, before we keep the mic moving, I wanted to say, you also host your

07:42.640 --> 07:43.640
own podcast, correct?

07:43.640 --> 07:44.640
Do you want to give it a plug?

07:44.640 --> 07:45.640
Yes, I do.

07:45.640 --> 07:51.000
I host a podcast called Anime Jam Session with me, DJ Rama S, and one of my good friends,

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Kuro Usagi.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.360
We record Tuesday or Wednesday nights.

07:54.360 --> 07:59.880
We try to get it out on our feed Thursday or Friday, so if you want to check it out,

07:59.880 --> 08:06.280
you can go over to djramas.net or feedburner.com slash anime jam session, and we'll put it

08:06.280 --> 08:07.280
out.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.280
Awesome.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.440
I want to apologize for the audio quality you've been hearing in the first little bits

08:10.440 --> 08:11.440
of the show, too.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.520
I think the mics got switched, and the guests got the mic with a very low gain, and I got

08:15.520 --> 08:18.940
the one with a very high gain, so I was very loud, and they were very quiet, but we've

08:18.940 --> 08:21.280
switched some things over here on the board.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.920
I ninja'd over to the board and switched some things while they were talking about their

08:23.920 --> 08:26.160
gaming Wii, so hopefully it's getting a little better.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.960
We'll see as we move on, and Dark Tetsuya, how was your gaming Wii?

08:28.960 --> 08:29.960
What have you been playing?

08:29.960 --> 08:31.960
Oh, just a lot of Need for Speed Carbon.

08:31.960 --> 08:37.480
I actually beat it, but I went back and did some of the challenges to unlock some more

08:37.480 --> 08:38.480
stuff.

08:38.480 --> 08:42.760
Now, don't you have a Justin TV channel or something where people can actually watch

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
you play games?

08:43.760 --> 08:47.440
I stream random emulators and stuff.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.160
What kind of games can people see if they check you out on the Justin TV?

08:50.160 --> 08:52.200
Well, I'm working on Zelda right now.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.400
I'm waiting to do Death Mountain.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.520
Nice.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.640
You know, I was actually on Justin TV very randomly one night, and you might not know

08:59.640 --> 09:02.800
what Dark Tetsuya, but I was watching you.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.080
That's the thing about Justin TV is you can actually watch people, and they never know.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.080
Oh, yeah.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.280
You were playing La Mulana, and that was actually the first time I'd ever seen it, so it was

09:10.280 --> 09:11.280
cool.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.960
I actually got to check that out.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.840
It does look very retro.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
I can see why people are really into that game.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
Oh, yeah.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
Very cool.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.840
All right.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.840
And you do not host your own podcast right now, right?

09:20.840 --> 09:21.840
No, not at the moment.

09:21.840 --> 09:22.840
Not at the moment.

09:22.840 --> 09:23.840
All right.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.840
Drew.

09:24.840 --> 09:28.280
Intern Drew, do you host a podcast, for heaven's sake, or be honest?

09:28.280 --> 09:29.280
Not yet.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.280
No.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.280
Oh, shit.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
You got plans for one, don't you?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
No, I'm not.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.000
Any asshole with a mic can do a podcast in this day and age.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Shit, look at us.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
All right.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Yeah, exactly.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
All right.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
How was your gaming week?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
It was all right.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
I have one of those Korean free-to-play what's-its action RPG.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I like that description.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
I don't know how to classify it.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.400
Korean free-to-play what's-it thingy-ma-bob guy.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.200
I don't know how to describe it.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.400
It's a platformer action game with RPG elements.

09:58.400 --> 10:06.440
That, I've been playing some Fire Emblem 7, trying to actually beat it, which is brutal,

10:06.440 --> 10:08.560
even on the first try.

10:08.560 --> 10:12.080
And aside from that, I haven't been playing much.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.680
Weren't you, Captain Excitement?

10:13.680 --> 10:22.560
I picked up Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 at a used bookstore the other day.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.880
I can't get it to run.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.880
It crashes.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.240
Best ten bucks I ever spent.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.440
Thank you, Ubisoft.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.080
Now make your games work.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
Nice.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.940
All right.

10:34.940 --> 10:39.160
I guess that's gonna be, he's putting his mic down somewhat angrily, so, Loki, how was

10:39.160 --> 10:40.160
your gaming week?

10:40.160 --> 10:41.160
What did you play?

10:41.160 --> 10:42.680
I'm trying to figure out which mic I'm supposed to be having here.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.680
I think you're that one.

10:44.680 --> 10:45.680
All right.

10:45.680 --> 10:51.920
I didn't play too much this week, because I've been busy, and I did play, well, Grand

10:51.920 --> 10:54.040
Theft Auto 4, which is not surprising.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.640
I actually had some guests come over.

10:55.640 --> 11:00.080
My sister hadn't seen Grand Theft Auto 4 yet, and she's a big fan of San Andreas, especially

11:00.080 --> 11:03.640
running around aimlessly in the co-op mode.

11:03.640 --> 11:08.380
So I showed her the swing set and other fun stuff about it, and she liked that.

11:08.380 --> 11:16.320
And then I got to play a little bit of Defender Castle, and that was fun, and Mario Kart Wii.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.080
We had to download a ton more Miis.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.200
In fact, we got one that's got a crab on the person's face, which is kind of funny, and

11:23.200 --> 11:25.020
it, like, pinches its claws.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.360
And then there's also...

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
Crab people!

11:27.360 --> 11:28.360
Yes, crab people.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.640
And then one with Mickey Mouse, and, I don't know, we just downloaded a bunch of Miis and

11:32.640 --> 11:36.920
then played at the levels with the Miis in the background, and that was funny.

11:36.920 --> 11:46.080
And I just tried the homebrew Smash Bros. game that someone had made or worked on, and

11:46.080 --> 11:50.640
I guess it's very early, because it's not very good right now, but, I mean, it's not...

11:50.640 --> 11:51.640
Needs work.

11:51.640 --> 11:58.240
It's not even close to being started, let alone done, so, yeah.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.240
So how was it for your week?

11:59.240 --> 12:02.080
You had a pretty slow gaming week, all things considered, but you got other projects going

12:02.080 --> 12:03.080
on, right?

12:03.080 --> 12:05.840
Yeah, I'm busy, and then my car was in the shop, so...

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
Oh, fun.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
Yeah.

12:07.840 --> 12:08.840
Fun, fun.

12:08.840 --> 12:09.840
You've had an exciting week.

12:09.840 --> 12:10.840
Not really.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.280
Uh, let's see, my gaming week.

12:12.280 --> 12:16.800
I got to play pinball at Dark Soccer's, which was pretty fun, I was mentioning that earlier.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.160
She's got so many freaking pinball machines in her house, it's pretty funny.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.080
And she's got, you know, the Black Knight 2000 I got to play for the first time.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.540
I don't think I'd ever played that Black Knight table before, because what's really funny

12:27.540 --> 12:30.840
about Jamie's house is that she has the Black Knight 2000 and the Black Knight right next

12:30.840 --> 12:31.840
to each other.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.840
So it's like...

12:32.840 --> 12:36.880
Oh, but she's saying that she's borrowing the Black Knight, but it's still fun.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.880
Still fun.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.720
Um, so pinball goodness at Dark Soccer's house.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.480
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

12:42.480 --> 12:51.680
I played World of Drama Craft, which was exciting this week, and also I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith

12:51.680 --> 12:53.560
for the first time at Dark Soccer's party.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.580
They had Guitar Hero Aerosmith going there.

12:55.580 --> 13:01.800
It's Guitar Hero 3, but with Aerosmith songs, and totally reskinned for Aerosmith, so that's

13:01.800 --> 13:02.800
pretty much it.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.280
That's all you need to know about the game.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.000
They really didn't change anything from guitar.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.760
I mean, I guess little bits in the story mode and what have you, but honestly, it's just

13:10.760 --> 13:13.060
Guitar Hero 3 with Aerosmith stuff.

13:13.060 --> 13:17.700
But the songs were good, I mean, because Aerosmith's pretty good, but I still don't think I could

13:17.700 --> 13:18.840
spend $60 on it.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.320
I would have to really, really love Aerosmith to spend that much money on it.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.280
Dan really loves Aerosmith.

13:24.280 --> 13:25.640
So then it's worth it to Dan.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.640
But we didn't buy it.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.640
Me?

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
Guitar Hero Journey?

13:28.640 --> 13:29.640
I would have dropped the $60.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.880
I would have paid $100 for Guitar Hero Journey, but it's not Guitar Hero Journey.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.640
It's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

13:35.640 --> 13:40.480
But it did motivate me to go back and actually play some Guitar Hero 3, and I still cannot

13:40.480 --> 13:42.880
beat that freaking Slipknot song on hard.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.880
The intro ticks me off.

13:43.880 --> 13:44.880
Did you download the free song?

13:44.880 --> 13:45.880
I did.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.440
The Top Gun song is awesome.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.680
I wish it was Danger Zone, but eh...

13:50.680 --> 13:51.680
That's all right.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
It's still...

13:52.680 --> 13:58.240
What a great patriotic tune to have the Top Gun theme, although it did make me sad because

13:58.240 --> 14:02.340
it made me think back to my birthday when the Top Gun ride wasn't working at Great America,

14:02.340 --> 14:03.560
and that pissed me off a little.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.560
But the song made it all better.

14:04.560 --> 14:09.160
Yeah, the last thing we need is, you know, homoerotic volleyball scenes.

14:09.160 --> 14:13.960
Yeah, so I love that.

14:13.960 --> 14:18.120
But here's the thing about Guitar Hero, is that you really have to get over, like, two

14:18.120 --> 14:22.320
skill humps, I don't know what you'd call them, little skill checks, to get better at

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
Guitar Hero.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.320
Okay?

14:24.320 --> 14:27.040
One of the skill checks is that you have to learn how to strum up and down.

14:27.040 --> 14:30.160
Like, if you just strum down the whole time, you're not going to be able to hit notes fast

14:30.160 --> 14:31.840
enough during some of the songs.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
That's the first little plateau.

14:32.840 --> 14:33.920
That's a good name.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.400
That's the first plateau you have to learn across.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.940
I am currently stuck on the second plateau of getting good at Guitar Hero, and that is

14:38.940 --> 14:42.960
learning how you don't have to strum for every note.

14:42.960 --> 14:47.720
If a note has a little white dot on it, or a rock band, it's a smaller note, if a note

14:47.720 --> 14:51.640
has a little white dot on it, you only have to hit the button for that note if you hit

14:51.640 --> 14:54.640
the note correctly at the start of the sequence.

14:54.640 --> 14:59.040
Like, that's the part I'm having trouble kind of getting over, because I want to strum everything,

14:59.040 --> 15:01.440
and it's hard to tell when the notes are going to be that fast, which ones you have to strum

15:01.440 --> 15:02.440
and which ones you don't.

15:02.440 --> 15:04.640
Does Guitar Hero people in chat know what I'm talking about?

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
Please.

15:05.640 --> 15:06.640
Or do I just sound crazy?

15:06.640 --> 15:07.640
I don't know.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.640
Because everybody in the studio is looking at me like, huh?

15:09.640 --> 15:10.640
What?

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
Yeah, like the hammer-ons and stuff.

15:11.640 --> 15:12.640
Exactly.

15:12.640 --> 15:13.640
And the tutorial does not explain it that well.

15:13.640 --> 15:18.640
The tutorial explains a little bit about how you can, like, never mind, I'm not even going

15:18.640 --> 15:21.060
to tell you how to explain it, but the tutorial doesn't explain it very well.

15:21.060 --> 15:23.200
It's kind of something I had to learn on my own.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.760
So there you have it.

15:24.760 --> 15:25.760
All right.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.760
Enough of my gaming week.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.680
You guys don't care about my Guitar Hero progression.

15:28.680 --> 15:32.720
Although, I did beat two new songs on Expert.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.720
Paint It Black.

15:33.720 --> 15:34.720
Awesome.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.720
All right.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.200
Soccer Max says hammer-ons and pull-offs.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.200
That's it.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
Exactly.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
Yes, Rama.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.200
What?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
Before we begin.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
Yes.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
I have presents.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
Presents?

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
What a good way to start tonight's housekeeping.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.200
Oh, shit.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.400
I love housekeepers that begin with presents.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.680
First off, before the show, I was showing the people on Justin TV this, but Loki got

15:52.680 --> 15:56.800
me some new floor mats with Hello Kitty on them, which is hilarious because I already

15:56.800 --> 15:57.920
had ones with penguins on them.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.520
So I'm going to figure out how to use them both.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.320
Maybe I'll put the ones with penguins out here or something.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.320
I got a t-shirt.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.320
Wipe your feet before you go in the house.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.320
I got the t-shirt.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.320
You got a t-shirt, too?

16:06.320 --> 16:08.320
Oh, you have the t-shirt of Hot Topic.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.320
I gun Liberty City.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.960
I gun Liberty City instead of a heart.

16:10.960 --> 16:11.960
But it's a gun.

16:11.960 --> 16:12.960
Lovely.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.960
Yes.

16:13.960 --> 16:14.960
So, Rama, presents.

16:14.960 --> 16:15.960
These are for you guys.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.480
My official I love New York shirt.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.480
That is very ironic.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.480
Wait.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.600
Hold that up and then have Loki stand up again right next to it.

16:22.600 --> 16:23.600
Wait.

16:23.600 --> 16:24.600
What the fuck?

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
Seriously.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
What the fuck?

16:26.600 --> 16:27.600
I know.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
It's like a scene demo.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600
We have I gun Liberty City.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
Again, you can look at this on our Justin TV channel.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.520
I just give you orange ones right here.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.920
And I heart and Y.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.000
So it's like you have the real thing and then the parody right next to each other.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.200
That's wonderful.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.520
I don't want to lie on a shirt.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.000
You guys didn't plan that, did you?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
You have no choice.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
It's amazing.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
Well, that's great.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Thank you so much for the shirts.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Wow.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
That's great.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.560
I'll change into one right now, but not live on cam because that's kind of gross.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.560
So thank you.

16:53.560 --> 16:54.560
Excellent.

16:54.560 --> 16:58.240
I do heart and why I can't wait to go back.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.240
So excellent.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.320
All right.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
Everybody in chat rooms.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.320
Hello.

17:04.320 --> 17:05.320
Welling.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.160
Sorry to those of you guys that listen on the podcast, but the nice thing, excuse me

17:07.160 --> 17:08.960
about Justin TV is that people can highlight.

17:08.960 --> 17:12.400
So I'm sure there will be a highlight of that clip later on.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.400
SSJ 100.

17:13.400 --> 17:17.000
Matt in chat says, and why represent, I'm sure he would say just like that too.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Hey.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Hey.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.480
Ice skull pirates.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.480
Oh my God.

17:23.480 --> 17:24.480
She is ice skull.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.480
Fuck pirates.

17:25.480 --> 17:30.080
I mean, what's wrong with you and your wildest dreams.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.920
I feel like I need an eye blank, something shirt to fit in pirates.

17:34.920 --> 17:35.920
No comment.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.920
What is that?

17:37.920 --> 17:40.000
All right.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
On the butt.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
It says pirates of the Caribbean.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
All right.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
Housekeeping.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.160
Um, what else?

17:45.160 --> 17:46.600
I don't really have anything for the show.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.400
We have no interviews coming up, which is kind of sad, but I will say this.

17:49.400 --> 17:53.660
We always have our live journal community in the MySpace communities and Facebook, Facebook.

17:53.660 --> 17:57.480
We are the O L army, O L R M Y if you want to look us up.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.600
If you want to join us on live journal, orange lounge, no radio, just orange lounge is us

18:01.600 --> 18:05.560
on live journal and on MySpace, we are orange lounge radio, three different names for three

18:05.560 --> 18:06.560
different sites.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.560
If we could be any more confusing.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.560
Good job.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.560
Standards department.

18:09.560 --> 18:15.400
Don't confuse us with the group orange range or the group orange lounge for that matter.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.720
Although I don't think has Tomosuke made an orange lounge song in like the past three

18:18.720 --> 18:19.720
years.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.720
I don't think he has.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
Has he?

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
No.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.720
So we own it now.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.720
I think.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
I think there's some rule now that we own orange lounge.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.720
All right.

18:26.720 --> 18:27.720
Just kidding.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.720
All right.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.280
Let's get to tonight's gaming news and Loki's going to start us off tonight.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.280
Yeah.

18:32.280 --> 18:33.680
So more details about mega man nine.

18:33.680 --> 18:38.200
It is going to be completely eight bit looking, including the very limited color palette as

18:38.200 --> 18:39.200
well.

18:39.200 --> 18:44.000
Uh, it's supposed to be also really fucking hard, just like, you know, most mega man games.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.520
And in fact, uh, there was some, uh, hands on stuff, um, from like a joystick and some

18:49.520 --> 18:54.840
other, um, groups out there including games, radar and stuff like that.

18:54.840 --> 18:59.280
And basically seeing that they've, you know, a few run throughs on different levels and

18:59.280 --> 19:05.040
it was damn near impossible, you know, kind of a famous puzzles from different games have

19:05.040 --> 19:06.040
come back.

19:06.040 --> 19:14.120
You know, the disappearing block, you know, um, platform puzzles and, uh, the one hit

19:14.120 --> 19:16.040
kill, um, beams that go across.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.040
Okay.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.120
I forgot to mention about my gaming week.

19:18.120 --> 19:22.160
I've been playing mega man, um, collected main man anniversary collection and I'm starting

19:22.160 --> 19:23.720
with mega man one, right?

19:23.720 --> 19:28.360
I am about to pull my fucking hair out on the ice man level with those fucking blocks.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.760
Whoever invented the block puzzles needs to burn in hell.

19:32.760 --> 19:33.760
All right.

19:33.760 --> 19:38.320
Once you get past the blocks, once you get past, then it only gets worse and mega man

19:38.320 --> 19:41.360
two and the heat man stage, unless you have item two, unless you have item two, which

19:41.360 --> 19:42.360
you ought to.

19:42.360 --> 19:43.360
Yeah, I know.

19:43.360 --> 19:49.200
But seriously, until about the fifth game, the fifth NES game, I never thought a mega

19:49.200 --> 19:51.120
man series is really that hard.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.480
Rob, if you want to make everything easy on the first mega man, cut man.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.480
I did.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.080
I have killed the cut man, elect man, guts man, bomb man.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.360
I'm just, I got to get ice man now so I can get fire man.

20:02.360 --> 20:06.880
And if all fails, sorry, if all fails, you got the rabbit start pause trick and I guess

20:06.880 --> 20:07.880
that's true.

20:07.880 --> 20:12.160
And the cool thing too, also, um, the game is supposed to be out by the end of the, well

20:12.160 --> 20:16.480
actually the beginning of the fourth quarter in, um, September.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.060
So that's going to be coming out in Japan.

20:18.060 --> 20:23.680
I'm guessing probably in the U S around the same time, you know, so, uh, we have a crap

20:23.680 --> 20:25.400
load of people in chat tonight.

20:25.400 --> 20:30.740
Chat that orange launch radio.com game grew says Nintendo games should be Nintendo hard.

20:30.740 --> 20:34.520
So with an eight big game should come that cause is it just, we're, we're eight big games

20:34.520 --> 20:36.180
more difficult than they are today.

20:36.180 --> 20:37.180
I think they are.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.180
Yeah.

20:38.180 --> 20:42.680
Uh, rice princess, are you excited about mega man nine and it's a increased difficulty or

20:42.680 --> 20:43.680
what?

20:43.680 --> 20:47.880
I am because I do not like the, uh, current incarnation of mega man.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.200
I like the oldest.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
You don't like legends.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
I love legends.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.960
No, you don't like mega man X or any of that stuff.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.960
They're okay.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.460
No, I like the Nintendo mega man.

20:57.460 --> 21:00.200
So this old school thing made you squee in many places, right?

21:00.200 --> 21:01.200
Yes.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
Good to hear.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.880
I think they should just continue with making mega man games just like this.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.680
Just make them all a bit from now on.

21:06.680 --> 21:12.480
And you know, if you want to do the 16 bit or the little, you know, higher graphics games,

21:12.480 --> 21:14.520
just do like the mega man X series.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.360
They have really too many series going on.

21:16.360 --> 21:23.560
They have that ZX series now, and then they also have, um, star force and just bring back

21:23.560 --> 21:26.160
legends, bring back the original eight bit mega man.

21:26.160 --> 21:30.080
Well, they are, you get, you get in half of what you want, but they need to continue

21:30.080 --> 21:32.440
and you know, one game is not bringing it back.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.240
Um, I got to, I got to read some comments as well from Justin TV.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.480
We have more people in Justin TV than I've ever seen before.

21:37.480 --> 21:38.480
This is crazy.

21:38.480 --> 21:43.160
Uh, illustrator says real fucking hard keeps the ignorant noobs away, but mega man nine

21:43.160 --> 21:44.280
is not really a multiplayer game.

21:44.280 --> 21:45.280
So who cares about noobs?

21:45.280 --> 21:48.680
Let a noob, noob themselves in their own home.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.120
It's supposed to be fucking hard and then you keep playing it until you can pass it

21:52.120 --> 21:54.080
and then you become better.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.080
You don't just go, Oh, I suck.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.160
Move on to next game.

21:57.160 --> 22:02.160
You know, as, as it was said before about leading noobs to water, most of, most of what

22:02.160 --> 22:05.600
you get are wet noobs and now you're leading noobs to splash woman.

22:05.600 --> 22:06.600
Yes.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
All right.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.600
Yeah.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.640
You know, I think she's going to be a bit wet.

22:11.640 --> 22:12.640
Yes.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.760
Oh, you're disgusting.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.080
Maybe that's a little tagline on the poster.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.900
This September's last woman gets wet.

22:19.900 --> 22:20.900
Are we explicit yet?

22:20.900 --> 22:21.900
Oh, we always are.

22:21.900 --> 22:22.900
We all better be.

22:22.900 --> 22:23.900
We always are.

22:23.900 --> 22:24.900
Fuck.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.900
Now we are.

22:25.900 --> 22:26.900
Thank you.

22:26.900 --> 22:27.900
No, not necessarily.

22:27.900 --> 22:32.200
You have to say it a few more times because I watched, fuck, fuckity fucker, fucker, fuck,

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
fuck, fuck.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.200
There you go.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.760
Cause I watched Hancock over the weekend and they did have fuck in there once, but it's

22:36.760 --> 22:37.760
still PG-13.

22:37.760 --> 22:40.880
But it's got cock in the title.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.440
Because he should have cock in the title.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.440
His name's John Hancock.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.320
Is that the fuck show already?

22:45.320 --> 22:46.320
Orange Lounge Cock-io.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.320
No, it's the cock show.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.840
All right.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.840
Anyway, so Mega Man Nine's been dated for September as well, right?

22:56.840 --> 22:59.160
Yes, that's what I already said.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.160
I'm sorry.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.160
I missed it.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.160
I was sleeping.

23:02.160 --> 23:08.760
I was, I was thinking about Splash Woman's cock, um, cause you know, she probably had

23:08.760 --> 23:13.320
one at some point, you know, doctor, uh, Dr. Wily has his leftover parts.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.320
Anyhow.

23:14.320 --> 23:18.800
You know, you know, what is it by with, with, with Wily and making every single one of his

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
robots male?

23:19.800 --> 23:20.800
Hmm.

23:20.800 --> 23:21.920
You think he's got a little secret?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.200
Now he's branching out.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
But he, but.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
Is it sexist?

23:25.200 --> 23:26.200
Dark soccer?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.200
No, it's bi.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.200
Is it sexist?

23:28.200 --> 23:29.200
No.

23:29.200 --> 23:35.720
Cause see, Dr. Wily likes little boys and, but that's okay because so does Dr. Light

23:35.720 --> 23:38.080
and Dr. Light also likes little girls.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.920
What the hell is wrong with this show?

23:39.920 --> 23:41.200
For real?

23:41.200 --> 23:43.400
I'm clicking unsubscribe right now.

23:43.400 --> 23:44.400
Click.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.400
That was disgusting.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.600
So you're saying Dr. Wily's a member of the Catholic church?

23:47.600 --> 23:49.680
God, Chris Hansen's going to be here any minute.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.200
Take a seat.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.200
Take a seat.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.240
Ah shit, you already took a seat.

23:55.240 --> 23:59.520
Because I don't think there's any altar girls.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.840
So he's probably Presbyterian.

24:01.840 --> 24:11.920
All right, look, let's go, let's go to a much cleaner, safer, kid-friendly game.

24:11.920 --> 24:15.240
Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing.

24:15.240 --> 24:21.720
There has been a teaser in the latest official Nintendo magazine over in the UK.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.200
And if you look at the magazine scan that's floating around the internet, or if you actually

24:25.200 --> 24:28.440
own the magazine, it says, it's been a while.

24:28.440 --> 24:30.640
It's time to revisit an old friend.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.520
How's your village doing these days?

24:33.520 --> 24:37.800
That is a, it just has a little picture from Animal Crossing and has that quote.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.880
Could that be a hint that we get Animal Crossing 83?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.520
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet.

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
What?

24:42.520 --> 24:47.000
I have thought that it's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.160
The Wii one's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions, why?

24:49.160 --> 24:51.960
I think it's going to make you load your GameCube village.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.400
Oh, maybe that's why the quote saying, how's your village doing all these days?

24:55.400 --> 24:58.280
In other words, you better go pull some fucking weeds or you're in for it when the new game

24:58.280 --> 24:59.280
comes out.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.280
Shit, yeah.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.920
It means I better go get my memory card back from my friend who was taking care of my village

25:01.920 --> 25:02.920
for me.

25:02.920 --> 25:03.920
It wasn't me, was it?

25:03.920 --> 25:04.920
No.

25:04.920 --> 25:05.920
No?

25:05.920 --> 25:06.920
No.

25:06.920 --> 25:07.920
That'd be funny is like the reason they're saying that they're all, yeah, you should

25:07.920 --> 25:09.680
really go back and check how your village is doing because you're not getting a new

25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
game.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.680
Better go back and play the old one.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.000
That might be the joke.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
Rob.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
What?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
I've got the Japanese one too.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.200
I got a new memory card.

25:17.200 --> 25:18.440
I lost my old village.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.480
I can't find it, but I have a new memory card.

25:20.480 --> 25:24.920
So I'm thinking about making like OLR town and maybe playing it on Justin TV and letting

25:24.920 --> 25:25.920
the chatters.

25:25.920 --> 25:26.920
You can do that, Rob.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.920
Yeah.

25:27.920 --> 25:28.920
Let the chatters name.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
For real.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
We'll do that.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.920
Because we have to have, who was the, who was the lesbian?

25:33.920 --> 25:34.920
I don't remember.

25:34.920 --> 25:35.920
She lived in my village.

25:35.920 --> 25:36.920
There was a lesbian that lived in the village.

25:36.920 --> 25:37.920
Yes.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.920
I remember.

25:38.920 --> 25:43.700
Her whole house was a gym and she was our resident lesbian, so we put a nice little

25:43.700 --> 25:44.700
rainbow sign in the side of her house.

25:44.700 --> 25:47.400
So we put a gay pride flag in front of her house and then she moved.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.400
Yes.

25:48.400 --> 25:51.720
And we ended up setting the, the, the, the pattern up and every time we visited.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.080
Didn't we have her saying like, I like boobs as a little thing?

25:55.080 --> 25:56.080
Yeah.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.080
Animal Crossing is so awesome.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.240
Someone went around going cock.

25:59.240 --> 26:05.520
Um, SS2-100 Matt says the question is if Rob and Irene will quit WoW to play Animal Crossing

26:05.520 --> 26:06.520
Wii.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.520
Uh, yes.

26:07.520 --> 26:08.520
Yeah, right.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.280
Rice princess says she already has.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.080
Are you getting a head start on only village?

26:13.080 --> 26:14.440
Only if they'll bat me wool.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.440
All right.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.040
It is a 12 step recovery program.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.040
All right.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
It is a 12 step recovery program.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.040
Well, we'll see.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.040
E3 is coming very soon.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.040
Yeah.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.040
Well, pulling the plug is a one step recovery program.

26:23.040 --> 26:27.160
I have my fingers and toes and other parts crossed that Animal Crossing will be an announcement

26:27.160 --> 26:28.160
at E3.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.480
So we'll see.

26:29.480 --> 26:30.480
We shall see.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.840
Let's move on with other news here.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.760
Um, wait, actually I'll read a quick chat comments here.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.720
Sharon says Animal Crossing was only somewhat kid friendly.

26:37.720 --> 26:39.920
It taught you to not take loans from anyone.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.900
If you do, you'll have to do bitch work for your neighbors and take all the furniture

26:42.900 --> 26:45.280
they throw away for the rest of your life.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.280
Nice.

26:46.280 --> 26:47.280
Very nice.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.280
All right.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.280
Cool.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.280
More news.

26:50.280 --> 26:51.280
Gotta.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.280
Gotta.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.280
Mm.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.280
Okay.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.280
Hey, guess what?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.280
Chicken butt.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.280
There's.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.280
Guess why?

26:59.280 --> 27:00.280
Chicken thigh.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.280
Aha.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.280
In your eye.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.960
This is totally one of those shows now.

27:04.960 --> 27:08.840
It's it's, you know what, having people in studio like a live audience practically ruins

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
this show.

27:09.840 --> 27:10.840
But Rob.

27:10.840 --> 27:11.840
What?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.840
For my show, for my story, you need to do something.

27:13.840 --> 27:14.840
Okay.

27:14.840 --> 27:15.840
What do I have to do for your story?

27:15.840 --> 27:18.600
Go to the said site that this refers to from Squeenix.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.600
Okay.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.280
And play the sound effect and see if anyone in the chat room gets it first.

27:22.280 --> 27:26.080
I I have a feeling everybody in chat already knows what's coming and I I don't.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.080
But I want the sound effect.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.080
All right.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.080
Yes, ma'am.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.040
Orange Land's radio is fucked up in front of a live audience.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.040
What a demanding woman tonight.

27:33.040 --> 27:34.040
It has to be there.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.040
Let's see.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.040
I've got to get there.

27:36.040 --> 27:37.040
Here we go.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.040
Oh, wait.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.040
That's not it.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.040
That's not me.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.920
You're going to have to start reading the story.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
I can't find it.

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
Okay.

27:43.920 --> 27:48.640
It's a game that I'm sure a lot of people have been wanting for quite a while.

27:48.640 --> 27:52.680
And by the way, it's the link that says Japanese website, by the way.

27:52.680 --> 27:54.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:54.040 --> 28:00.680
Are they bringing back to to some sort of system there?

28:00.680 --> 28:01.680
Super Metroid?

28:01.680 --> 28:02.680
Because that game is awesome.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.680
No.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.680
Squeenix didn't make some Metroid.

28:04.680 --> 28:11.360
They're bringing back an RPG that is speculated to be a port, hopefully remaining in 2D on

28:11.360 --> 28:13.440
the Nintendo DS.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.440
Is it Infuriate or Super Metroid?

28:15.440 --> 28:17.440
Shut up.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.600
I see what you did there.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.920
It's not at all.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.920
But do the viewers, do the listeners.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.720
I'm going to throw something at you, okay?

28:25.720 --> 28:26.720
Please do.

28:26.720 --> 28:37.320
Anyway, um, Chrono Trigger, if you go to, um, Squeenix's site, the, um, address is square-annex.co.jp

28:37.320 --> 28:47.120
slash, um, uh, C-T-D-S. And, um, as Rob is pulling it up now.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.760
It's kind of slow because we're broadcasting.

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
Yeah.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.760
There you go.

28:50.760 --> 28:51.760
There we go.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.200
You want to hear the effect?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.760
I don't even know if they're going to hear it.

28:55.760 --> 28:57.600
We got so much shit running in the studio tonight.

28:57.600 --> 29:02.480
At any rate, well, if you go to that site, you will see the clock.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.160
And you will hear the ticking.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.340
And you will know that it's Chrono Trigger.

29:06.340 --> 29:10.440
Because no other game freaking has that clock making that same ticking noise at the very

29:10.440 --> 29:11.440
start of it.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.440
The clock stopped moving.

29:12.440 --> 29:16.360
Yeah, my computer is not enjoying, uh, broadcasting an internet radio show and doing the Chrono

29:16.360 --> 29:17.360
Trigger website at the same time.

29:17.360 --> 29:21.320
So we will, we will let you do that for yourself so that you can have a truly interactive experience

29:21.320 --> 29:23.120
those of you listening to the podcast.

29:23.120 --> 29:29.000
Uh, AlphaKananagram says in chat, DarkSakura, now it's ChronoTrigger.jp as well.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
Is it?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
Rad.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
Uh, Shaoranz.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
Don't make it 3D, Squeenix.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
Don't fuck it up.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.840
Shaoranz says, Chrono Trigger, it's over.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.960
Seriously, guys, there are other RPGs that have better storylines and better character

29:38.960 --> 29:39.960
development.

29:39.960 --> 29:40.960
No!

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
No!

29:41.960 --> 29:42.960
Oh, snap.

29:42.960 --> 29:43.960
No!

29:43.960 --> 29:44.960
Oh, snap.

29:44.960 --> 29:45.960
Object.

29:45.960 --> 29:46.960
You did not, okay?

29:46.960 --> 29:47.960
I think you did.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.440
And, and they haven't translated the ones that do surpass it.

29:49.440 --> 29:55.400
Here's the thing, I, I heard that the Chrono Trigger, oh, so what, Logie, what?

29:55.400 --> 29:56.400
Nothing.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.400
I'm, I'm good.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.160
I just want to say about Chrono Trigger, it's not 3D.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.080
Don't we already know it's going to be the same old sprites?

30:02.080 --> 30:03.080
Yes, exactly.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.360
We did nothing that we can tell, at least.

30:06.360 --> 30:08.040
Bonus dungeon, Wi-Fi play.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.040
Something like that.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.440
Maybe, maybe add, like, some bonus dungeons and, um, I heard co-op, but, you know, how

30:13.440 --> 30:14.880
can you play co-op in that game?

30:14.880 --> 30:15.880
Because you have three people.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.880
It would be, like, Secret of Mana.

30:17.880 --> 30:18.880
Uh.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.080
That might be a little strange.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
I don't know about that.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.640
Well, Secret of Mana, you could have, um, three characters in Seiken, too, but the only

30:24.640 --> 30:31.080
way that you could control all three of them was, uh, having a tap.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.080
That was fun.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
That was a lot of fun.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.280
I've got a multi-tap, so that was a lot of fun.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.280
Good times.

30:35.280 --> 30:39.840
But, um, but the other speculation, and actually I hope that this will be included, is that

30:39.840 --> 30:46.640
the, um, the animated scenes that they did for the PlayStation version, um, are, uh,

30:46.640 --> 30:52.160
are rumored to be making it to the DS version, especially if they're spending less of the,

30:52.160 --> 30:58.520
uh, processing power on the way the game runs and putting more of it into having the cinemas,

30:58.520 --> 31:01.200
because that'll, that'll make it sweet.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.200
More endings!

31:02.200 --> 31:05.200
SSJ100madass, uh, co-op, gato battle.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.200
Ooh, sweet.

31:06.200 --> 31:11.400
So, I wanna know, everyone who's in this room that's played Chrono Trigger, how many endings

31:11.400 --> 31:12.400
have you gotten?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.400
Two.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.960
Hell, if I remember, probably four.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.600
All of them.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.280
You have no time on your hands, sir.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.800
I mean, you have, uh, too much time.

31:21.800 --> 31:27.680
What was the secret one where you go watch the, uh, she would open the thing with the

31:27.680 --> 31:29.880
pendant and then you would go beat the game?

31:29.880 --> 31:35.520
That was the very first one where you go in the teleporter and, um, right after you do

31:35.520 --> 31:40.280
the teleport trick, and you can fight Lavas right from the start, but you have to, you

31:40.280 --> 31:42.800
would, like, die instantly if you didn't do it in New Game Plus.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.200
Oh, yeah.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.200
Hmm.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.200
And I've done that one.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.280
That's the one where you get the developers ending, where you actually have representations

31:49.280 --> 31:53.560
of the developers and you go in, like, the last room and it's Toriyama wearing his, uh,

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
gas mask and everything.

31:54.560 --> 31:58.560
And the credits go by really, really fast, because, you know, they want you to skip past

31:58.560 --> 31:59.700
it again.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.480
All this freaking reminiscing here in studio.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.400
Loki looks like he's about to, uh, explode wanting to talk about Elibits.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.800
No, I don't really care, right?

32:05.800 --> 32:06.800
That's right.

32:06.800 --> 32:11.280
I didn't play really much of Chrono Trigger and I don't, I don't feel bad for not having

32:11.280 --> 32:14.560
played Chrono Trigger either, so.

32:14.560 --> 32:19.040
If I want to play Chrono Trigger, I'll hook up my Super Nintendo and grab my cartridge.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.400
I think the DS one might be kind of cool.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
I mean, it's...

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
I've been playing Final Fantasy VI.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.400
The scene is getting a Chrono Trigger Super Nintendo cartridge at this time.

32:26.400 --> 32:29.240
If you didn't hang on to one, it's going to cost you a lot of money to get one now.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
Hey Rob!

32:30.240 --> 32:32.880
This game is going to have the super secret final ending where you take the game back

32:32.880 --> 32:35.320
to GameStop and trade it in for store credit.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.760
Rob, please let go.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.360
I didn't pay for my copy.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.760
Someone gave it to me and he left.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.760
So I have it in the box.

32:43.760 --> 32:44.760
Nice.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
Inherited.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
I don't plan on paying for my copy either.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.760
What a coincidence!

32:47.760 --> 32:48.760
I know!

32:48.760 --> 32:49.760
Alright, move on.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
More stories.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.280
Okay, less exciting news.

32:52.280 --> 32:58.080
Elibits 2 has been confirmed and, uh, it's not the same Elibits you may have remembered.

32:58.080 --> 33:04.400
Now it's some sort of top-down, sprite-based game and there's lots of Elibits running around.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.480
It's almost like a cartoony version of Pikmin or something like that.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.880
I don't know.

33:09.880 --> 33:14.440
But Elibits, the Adventures of Kayin Zeros coming out this fall...

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
I don't know.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.960
It looks weird.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.920
Do you think maybe they're just like, you know, the Wii one just didn't work like we

33:20.920 --> 33:24.640
wanted it to, so let's just jump ship and go to the DS, because we know it'll solve

33:24.640 --> 33:25.640
more.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.960
The 3D version on the DS and they're like, wow, that sucks, and then they're just like,

33:28.960 --> 33:33.200
okay, let's see what we can do with the touchscreen and...

33:33.200 --> 33:34.200
I don't know.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.520
There's no way they could've done the 3D version on the DS anyways, because there's no depth

33:38.520 --> 33:39.520
in it.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.520
True.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.520
True.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
It'd be weird.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.480
There's not a lot of depth in a lot of DS games, actually.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.520
It looks like Pokemon.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
It seriously looks like...

33:47.520 --> 33:51.720
Well, Pokemon sells billions and billions of copies, so it probably is not a bad idea.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.720
Yeah.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.120
There you have it.

33:54.120 --> 33:57.440
Coming to the Wii, however, even if Elibits 2 may not be coming to the Wii, apparently

33:57.440 --> 34:01.900
Cooking Mama, there's going to be another Cooking Mama game on the Wii.

34:01.900 --> 34:07.240
It's Cooking Mama World Kitchen, and it's coming to you from Majesco, and it's a follow-up

34:07.240 --> 34:11.480
to the game Cooking Mama Cook-Off, which was kind of crap, because they tried to port a

34:11.480 --> 34:15.000
DS game to the Wii, and it just didn't work very well, sadly.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.800
Well, apparently Cooking Mama World Kitchen is a game that's actually being designed for

34:18.800 --> 34:23.480
the Wii, and it's coming out for the holidays, and now instead of just the sprite graphics,

34:23.480 --> 34:28.200
you're actually going to have polygon 3D-ish graphics, new minigames, new things to cook

34:28.200 --> 34:34.360
up, and apparently, rhythm-based gameplay, so now Cooking Mama's going to be all rhythmic,

34:34.360 --> 34:35.860
so that could be interesting.

34:35.860 --> 34:39.000
This could either be really awesome or really crappy.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.040
I'm betting on the second.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.800
I really hope not, because Cooking Mama's kind of cool.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.800
I don't know.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.780
Jamie, I know you love Cooking Mama very much.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.960
What do you think about a rhythm-based Cooking Mama game on the Wii?

34:47.960 --> 34:52.120
I'll reserve judgment until I actually try it, but that's how I say it.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.120
I know.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.600
It's the same way, but your heart doesn't, like, you know...

34:55.600 --> 34:59.760
I'm completely apathetic towards it right now.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
Alright.

35:00.760 --> 35:01.760
I will play it.

35:01.760 --> 35:05.280
I'm interested, but I'm not going to make my judgment until I actually see it, because

35:05.280 --> 35:11.760
honestly, I've had games where I've made a harsh judgment about them to start, and it's

35:11.760 --> 35:15.520
turned out that they've been pretty fun, so I'm not going to...

35:15.520 --> 35:16.520
Like Imagine Babies?

35:16.520 --> 35:17.520
Hell no!

35:17.520 --> 35:18.520
That game sucks!

35:18.520 --> 35:24.600
That game is like the, it's like the bugs that live in shit.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.080
Let's see, where did we have in the chat room?

35:28.080 --> 35:33.000
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
That might be a Cooking Mama.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
We're listening to that this weekend.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.000
That's the words out of my mouth.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.680
Frisbee says, Cooking Mama Hell's Kitchen.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.040
Now that might be a little bit fun if somebody screams at Cooking Mama and makes her cry.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.480
Except if they base it off of a show, it should be based off of a good show.

35:46.480 --> 35:51.120
Well, Hell's Kitchen is already getting a DS game, and it's actually coming out before

35:51.120 --> 35:52.880
Cooking Mama, so...

35:52.880 --> 35:53.880
Interesting.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.760
I don't know if that's going to be any good, though.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.000
Alright, well there you have it.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.800
So we'll see about that Cooking Mama game.

36:00.800 --> 36:06.240
I don't know, I have to admit, it makes me a little bit nervous, but we'll see.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.840
We shall.

36:07.840 --> 36:16.460
Well, for more happy wee news, this might make some people very pleased, but there is

36:16.460 --> 36:22.480
a, uh, a little bit more coming out on the, uh, for WiiWare.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.160
It was actually released on Friday.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.560
It's um...

36:27.560 --> 36:34.160
First is Pokemon Ranch, where, to quote, it's a place where Pokemon and people love living

36:34.160 --> 36:35.160
together.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.160
Bleh.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.160
Yeah.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.160
Anyway.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.360
You don't think they need Pokemon Bunny Ranch?

36:40.360 --> 36:41.360
No.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.360
Or Pokemon Sniper.

36:43.360 --> 36:47.960
It's Jigglypimp's Whore Lounge from Kalec in the House.

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
Slut Bunny.

36:48.960 --> 36:49.960
No, I already showed you.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.760
You need to watch that, okay?

36:51.760 --> 36:52.760
Anyway.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.760
I did.

36:53.760 --> 36:54.760
It's a Pokemon parody, it's funny.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.760
Yes.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.760
Anyway.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.640
Um, it's supposed to be sort of like a cross between Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon,

37:00.640 --> 37:07.080
to where you will bring in your Pokemon from Diamond and Pearl, and you can play with them

37:07.080 --> 37:12.360
and take pictures, and um, and you can do stuff.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.560
You just can't level with them.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.860
Shauran in chat wants to know if you can brand them.

37:18.860 --> 37:20.360
That would be awesome.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.360
Yeee-hoo!

37:21.360 --> 37:22.360
Pika!

37:22.360 --> 37:25.840
Uh, Pokemon Snap 2.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.360
This time, you have a gun.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.360
Kinky.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.360
Pokemon Sniper.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.640
A whole new kind of rail shooter.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.360
Pokemon Snap-ther next.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.360
Aww.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.600
Cheeseburger says, Imagine Sniper.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
Chat downwards on Twitter.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.600
I would play Imagine Sniper.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.600
That'd be like Silent Scope, though.

37:41.600 --> 37:50.600
And, um, but it's going to be a thousand Wii points, and the other one is a game that you

37:50.600 --> 37:52.760
pop bubbles on.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.800
The bubble-popping game is finally coming out.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.800
It's called Pop.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.240
What a clever title.

37:57.240 --> 37:58.240
You just pop bubbles.

37:58.240 --> 37:59.240
Can you pop Pokemon?

37:59.240 --> 38:00.240
Is it like Buster Brothers?

38:00.240 --> 38:08.600
No, I think it's supposed to be more like, um, there's, it's a bubble-wraps, like, online

38:08.600 --> 38:09.600
game.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.080
I played with that the other day!

38:11.080 --> 38:12.080
It was called Bubble-Wrap!

38:12.080 --> 38:16.200
Let me, it was called Going to Seize Candy, and the best part is the Bubble-Wrap.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.200
What?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.200
It was called I Bought a Teapot and Played the Bubble-Wrap.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.400
Here's my question.

38:20.400 --> 38:24.200
If you feed a Pokemon an Alka-Seltzer, will it explode?

38:24.200 --> 38:25.200
That's what I want to know.

38:25.200 --> 38:26.200
No.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.200
No?

38:27.200 --> 38:28.200
Only, only the avian ones will.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.560
Well, that's some of them.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.560
There's birds.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.040
Pikachu giblets everywhere.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.920
Rice Princess has this horrified look on her face.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
Are you, are you okay?

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
Would you play Pokemon Ranch?

38:36.920 --> 38:38.920
Does it sound like a fun game to you?

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
No.

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
Alright.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
Wait.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
Wait.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.920
What?

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
It's 700 Wii points.

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
We'll see.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
To pop bubbles.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
This is awesome, though.

38:47.920 --> 38:50.960
Nintendo and WiiWare, they're really doing, like, some different things.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.640
You know, well, people want, like, a new Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.400
You get Crystal Chronicles, you know, My Life as the King.

38:57.400 --> 39:01.080
It's not really a Crystal Chronicles game, it's more of, like, other people are having

39:01.080 --> 39:05.320
fun outside of your city and you're just staying home watching TV, and that's kind of what

39:05.320 --> 39:06.320
it is.

39:06.320 --> 39:11.600
So, Pokemon, you know, Ranch, oh, well, yo, we could put out a Pokemon game on WiiWare,

39:11.600 --> 39:15.960
but no, let's make a game where you take Pokemon from other games that you have to purchase,

39:15.960 --> 39:19.160
or you can just sit there and wait days and days and days for a new Pokemon to come to

39:19.160 --> 39:23.040
your ranch and walk around and do nothing, except take pictures with them.

39:23.040 --> 39:30.360
I, I feel an OLR game somewhere in here called, like, God Damn I'm So Bored.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.760
We play it every Sunday.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.080
No, Rob, that's like, that's like, that's like the online, that's like the Mii parade.

39:36.080 --> 39:42.920
And God Damn I'm So Bored, you start a podcast with your two friends, and then you just sit

39:42.920 --> 39:44.520
there and pop bubble wrap the whole time.

39:44.520 --> 39:47.320
I don't know, there's a game to be made here somewhere, I gotta think about it.

39:47.320 --> 39:52.240
You also have to include, um, turning on your Wii for the first time and trying to watch

39:52.240 --> 39:55.720
Mii March with only one Mii on it.

39:55.720 --> 39:56.720
That's God Damn I'm So Lonely.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.720
I, I, I, I had that moment in my first month of Wii.

39:57.720 --> 40:02.320
No, no, no, because you eventually get more Mii as you open yourself up to the internet,

40:02.320 --> 40:06.080
but I remember when we first got our Wii, we just turned it on, and Dan and I were watching

40:06.080 --> 40:07.800
this blank screen going, where are they?

40:07.800 --> 40:08.800
I want to see the parade!

40:08.800 --> 40:12.360
No, seriously, all the games on WiiWare seem to be very limited and stupid like this.

40:12.360 --> 40:18.320
I mean, there's, um, the Star Soldier game that has two levels, awesome!

40:18.320 --> 40:20.320
And then there's, like, um, what else do they have?

40:20.320 --> 40:24.180
Well, they have Dr. Mario, but that's just, you know, Dr. Mario.

40:24.180 --> 40:29.120
And, um, they've got this other game that's another DS port of a game that's a ripoff

40:29.120 --> 40:30.120
of Zuma.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.120
And...

40:31.120 --> 40:32.120
Magnetica.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.120
Magnetica.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.120
Totally different.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.120
A better name.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.120
A better name.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.120
Well, it's not all...

40:37.120 --> 40:42.120
Because Magnetica sounds like a Mega Man boss or something.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.120
Magnetica.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.120
Maybe not.

40:44.120 --> 40:50.520
Um, and then they have, what is it, Toki Tori, which, that game's just lame, and, um,

40:50.520 --> 40:55.080
the Bubble Popping game, which, I don't know, it's all kind of lame.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.480
Alright, well.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.960
Oh well.

40:57.960 --> 41:01.080
Um, something else that hopefully is not lame.

41:01.080 --> 41:07.120
Castlevania Judgment, the kind of, not really a Castlevania game, but now it's, uh, Soul

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
Castlevania.

41:08.120 --> 41:12.560
You know, Soul Calibur, but Castlevania characters and that kind of thing.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.400
Um, it will have Wii DS connectivity.

41:16.400 --> 41:26.080
You'll be able to plug in your new order of S, what was it, uh, Ecclesia, the new DS platformer

41:26.080 --> 41:29.480
game coming out, to unlock bonus gameplay content.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.720
And also so Konami can say, we sold you one of each.

41:32.720 --> 41:33.720
Sucker.

41:33.720 --> 41:39.080
Let me guess, let me guess, I'm thinking a character that you only see in the DS game

41:39.080 --> 41:42.480
is going to be playable in the Wii game if you connect them.

41:42.480 --> 41:43.480
What do you think?

41:43.480 --> 41:44.480
What do you think?

41:44.480 --> 41:45.480
And, yeah.

41:45.480 --> 41:46.480
What do you think?

41:46.480 --> 41:47.480
And guess what?

41:47.480 --> 41:50.760
It's probably paid to unlock content because you're paying for the DS game to unlock the

41:50.760 --> 41:53.160
content on the DS that was already there.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.160
Yeah.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.160
Wouldn't surprise me at all.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.160
Wouldn't surprise me at all.

41:56.160 --> 41:57.800
But here's what you need to do.

41:57.800 --> 42:02.480
You get a friend that has this game for the DS and you just have them come over and done.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.480
No purchase necessary.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.480
There you go.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.480
All right.

42:05.480 --> 42:10.800
Well, Loki was talking about this a little bit earlier during his gaming week, but if

42:10.800 --> 42:15.320
you haven't heard yet, there's a homebrew Super Smash Brothers Rumble that's available

42:15.320 --> 42:17.400
on the DS.

42:17.400 --> 42:21.820
It's by a homebrew programmer that goes by the name of Fuzzy.

42:21.820 --> 42:23.560
If you touch him, do you get dizzy?

42:23.560 --> 42:25.960
That's what I want to know.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
Bad joke there.

42:26.960 --> 42:30.480
Now, apparently though, the game only has three levels in it right now and just one

42:30.480 --> 42:32.240
character is playable in the game.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.240
It's Mario.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.640
Now, I have not actually played the game.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.600
There's YouTubage of it, but Loki, since you've actually played the game, tell us a little

42:37.600 --> 42:38.920
more about it.

42:38.920 --> 42:39.920
It's very simplified.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.800
I mean, it's sprite-based characters.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.760
Is it Smash Brothers or is it like Mario?

42:44.760 --> 42:46.680
It's supposed to be like Smash Brothers.

42:46.680 --> 42:47.680
Okay.

42:47.680 --> 42:48.680
Okay.

42:48.680 --> 42:53.160
But, you know, the only playable character is Mario right now and the computer player

42:53.160 --> 42:54.160
doesn't really do anything.

42:54.160 --> 42:57.720
He just kind of runs around trying to avoid you and you can't really smash him off the

42:57.720 --> 43:01.200
edge, you know, defeating the purpose of Smash Brothers.

43:01.200 --> 43:05.560
Personally, I think they should just port over Mugen, but, you know, that's just...

43:05.560 --> 43:07.040
It's asking a bit much.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.720
Well, I don't know if he would be able to run it either.

43:09.720 --> 43:10.960
All right.

43:10.960 --> 43:15.000
Well, if you are homebrew enabled on your DS, which I'm actually kind of curious.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.160
I'm going to ask the chat room a question.

43:17.160 --> 43:19.800
How many people are actually homebrew enabled on their DS?

43:19.800 --> 43:21.200
We have how many people in chat right now?

43:21.200 --> 43:22.560
Almost 50 people in chat right now.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.920
I want to know how many of you are homebrew enabled in chat right now.

43:25.920 --> 43:28.440
Say something while we go over some release dates.

43:28.440 --> 43:29.640
We'll start with the UK.

43:29.640 --> 43:34.760
Well, coming out in the UK, we have a number of things all on the 11th.

43:34.760 --> 43:41.080
We have Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic Games.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.480
That's on PC.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.080
Devil May Cry 4 on PC.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.960
Doodle Hex on DS.

43:46.960 --> 43:49.080
Secret Agent Clank on PSP.

43:49.080 --> 43:51.120
Sports Party on Wii.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.560
Summer Athletics on PS2, PC, and Xbox 360.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.400
And The Incredible Hulk on PS2.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.560
Sounds like a busy week.

43:59.560 --> 44:06.880
In the US, it's not that busy of a week, but there's still some stuff coming out.

44:06.880 --> 44:14.980
Civilization Revolution coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the DS.

44:14.980 --> 44:19.840
Also this week, Unreal Tournament 3 for the Xbox 360.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.200
We've got...

44:21.200 --> 44:22.200
Let's see here.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.520
Lots of people looking forward to that one on 360.

44:25.520 --> 44:26.520
Yes.

44:26.520 --> 44:35.600
Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii, which I suppose, I guess it's not quite

44:35.600 --> 44:38.480
a port of the DS game.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.760
Carnival Games on the DS.

44:40.760 --> 44:43.120
And Wonder World Amusement Park on the Wii.

44:43.120 --> 44:46.920
Wait, is the Carnival Games on the DS the other way around where they ported a Wii game

44:46.920 --> 44:47.920
to the DS?

44:47.920 --> 44:48.920
Yes.

44:48.920 --> 44:49.920
That's interesting.

44:49.920 --> 44:50.920
Yeah.

44:50.920 --> 44:57.760
Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PS3 and Xbox 360.

44:57.760 --> 45:00.800
Devil May Cry 4 on the PC.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.600
Per Pals for the Wii.

45:03.600 --> 45:08.360
Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on the PSP.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.680
And let's see.

45:10.680 --> 45:14.440
And I believe that's pretty much it for the week.

45:14.440 --> 45:19.600
Stigax 282 says, Civ Rev for the fucking win, I agree, that's the game I'm definitely looking

45:19.600 --> 45:23.660
forward to because I actually really like the demo and I don't think it's going to crap

45:23.660 --> 45:27.440
on my childhood memories of the original Civilization, which I was a little worried about at first,

45:27.440 --> 45:28.760
so I'm pretty excited about that.

45:28.760 --> 45:30.940
GameGuru agrees, Civ Rev for the win.

45:30.940 --> 45:33.920
And RobW2B says, Carnival Games is a different game.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.160
It's not the same thing.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.360
By the way, let's go back real quick before I do Japanese dates and see how many of our

45:38.360 --> 45:41.520
chat rooms are currently homebrew enabled.

45:41.520 --> 45:44.040
Let's see, where were we?

45:44.040 --> 45:45.040
Where do we start in chat?

45:45.040 --> 45:47.040
N, I don't.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.480
Me, I don't even have a DS.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.440
If I knew how to do it, I am, Skye.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.680
I am homebrew enabled.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.520
Raise his hand, can play homebrew, nope.

45:54.520 --> 45:55.800
I am homebrew enabled.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.800
Yep.

45:56.800 --> 45:57.960
DS, what's that?

45:57.960 --> 46:00.120
I have not turned on my DS in like a year.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.000
I'm not, but my friends is.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Yes.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.720
No homebrew on my DS.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.400
I am homebrew enabled for DS, Wii, PSP.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.800
I don't even have a DS.

46:08.800 --> 46:12.660
And lastly, my GBA, DS, PSP, and iPod are all running homebrew apps.

46:12.660 --> 46:14.880
That's actually a larger percentage than I would have thought.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.840
Because I don't run homebrew on my DS because I just don't know how to do it.

46:18.840 --> 46:24.040
And Mokey's like, hey, you want a hit?

46:24.040 --> 46:27.000
Well, once you get the device to do it, it's really simple.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.880
I mean, it's just drag drop, you know, no thought.

46:30.880 --> 46:31.880
Interesting.

46:31.880 --> 46:36.280
It's not like, you know, a Wii or some installations required and that kind of thing.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.720
Alright, well let's go over to Japan and look at some release dates coming out over there.

46:39.720 --> 46:45.360
On the Xbox 360, some games are getting a price reduction.

46:45.360 --> 46:50.760
Viva Piñata on the Xbox 360 is getting cut in price, as well as Forza Motorsport 2 and

46:50.760 --> 46:54.640
Test Drive Unlimited, as well as The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.560
They all move into the Platinum Collection in Japan this week.

46:57.560 --> 47:01.960
As far as new games go, Kane & Lynch Deadman comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

47:01.960 --> 47:03.220
That's a new one.

47:03.220 --> 47:08.120
Coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on July 10th, Dark Sector as well as Kane & Lynch

47:08.120 --> 47:11.200
Deadman comes out on the PlayStation 3.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.640
Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, checking out what's over there.

47:13.640 --> 47:15.160
Not a lot.

47:15.160 --> 47:19.800
Biohazard Zero, which of course is Resident Evil outside of the US.

47:19.800 --> 47:23.800
Biohazard Zero comes out as well on July the 10th.

47:23.800 --> 47:28.240
Going over to the handhelds in Japan, I'm sorry, first PlayStation 2, again, a couple

47:28.240 --> 47:31.680
games go into the best series, but here's one a lot of people are looking forward to.

47:31.680 --> 47:35.420
Persona 4 comes out in Japan on July 10th.

47:35.420 --> 47:40.640
And if you're a hardcore RPG fan and you can read Japanese and understand it, you are probably

47:40.640 --> 47:44.480
importing this game, I would imagine.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.360
Just call it a hunch.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.840
But I know people are crazy about Persona 4.

47:48.840 --> 47:53.720
On the Nintendo DS, Custom Beat Battle Draglade 2 comes out.

47:53.720 --> 47:58.380
Cosmetic Paradise, Maki no Kiseki comes out.

47:58.380 --> 48:00.360
What else do we have here?

48:00.360 --> 48:03.640
Another couple games go into price reduction, so lots of sales this week.

48:03.640 --> 48:09.280
Pet Shop, Monogatari DS comes out from Taito.

48:09.280 --> 48:14.720
On the Sony PSP, I doubt there's a lot this week.

48:14.720 --> 48:15.720
Taking a look.

48:15.720 --> 48:19.720
Oh, God of War Chains of Olympus, I take that back.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.840
God of War Chains of Olympus gets its Japanese version this week.

48:22.840 --> 48:23.840
So check that out.

48:23.840 --> 48:27.880
I thought I read that last week on the show, so I must have been looking in advance or

48:27.880 --> 48:28.880
something.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.720
Also, a Vehicle Battle game comes out on the PSP from Irem.

48:32.720 --> 48:38.160
Pongkotsu Roman Daika Sugeki Bumpy Trot.

48:38.160 --> 48:43.920
It's um, God what the hell do they call it, Steam Bot Chronicles.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.880
I like that other name though, that's cute.

48:45.880 --> 48:46.880
Bumpy Trot.

48:46.880 --> 48:47.880
Bumpy Trot.

48:47.880 --> 48:51.160
See, I'd buy it here if it was called Bumpy Trot, but no, I just gotta have a lame name.

48:51.160 --> 48:54.840
I have a bunch of these little harmonicas for that game at work.

48:54.840 --> 48:55.840
I don't know why.

48:55.840 --> 48:56.840
What?

48:56.840 --> 48:59.920
It was some crap that they sent us to promote the game.

48:59.920 --> 49:04.040
Unfortunately they sent it like a year after it came out, and I was like, okay, I can't

49:04.040 --> 49:06.000
do anything with this.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.360
Random question from chat that has nothing to do with anything we're talking about.

49:09.360 --> 49:12.640
Fear the Claw asks, well sort of, because we mention it during release dates.

49:12.640 --> 49:15.760
Fear the Claw asks, I've never played Viva Pinata, what is it?

49:15.760 --> 49:16.760
Is it really that bad?

49:16.760 --> 49:19.040
Uh, gosh, where do we begin?

49:19.040 --> 49:24.640
Viva Pinata was Xbox 360's kind of foray to try and rip off Pokemon in a way.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
Not necessarily rip off.

49:25.640 --> 49:28.160
They went in it full board, they actually did a TV show.

49:28.160 --> 49:29.160
TV show, everything.

49:29.160 --> 49:34.200
You know, the problem was, the game was too complicated for seven year olds to understand.

49:34.200 --> 49:37.680
And then the teenagers and adults that wanted to play it, it was a little bit too much of

49:37.680 --> 49:38.840
a kid game.

49:38.840 --> 49:42.520
So the original's not bad, it's not a bad game by any means, especially considering

49:42.520 --> 49:47.000
how cheap we can find it now, but the sequel, Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's bad.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.400
Because that wasn't even the same type of game.

49:50.400 --> 49:54.160
But then there's gonna be another sequel that's gonna be Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise,

49:54.160 --> 49:58.400
which is coming out in September on the 360, so if you really want to check that out, maybe

49:58.400 --> 49:59.880
wait until that comes out.

49:59.880 --> 50:04.840
And then there's also Viva Pinata Park to Paradise, which is coming out in the DS in

50:04.840 --> 50:05.840
September as well, I think.

50:05.840 --> 50:06.840
All right.

50:06.840 --> 50:08.600
Well, let's get back to some gaming news.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.120
Now you know release dates are out of the blood.

50:11.120 --> 50:17.040
Well, in other news, and this actually specifically goes for folks in Chandler, Arizona, at the

50:17.040 --> 50:20.960
McCullough Price House, there's a, I don't know if this is still going on, but it was

50:20.960 --> 50:27.520
going on as of the first, but an exhibit that's ancient history of video games, specifically

50:27.520 --> 50:33.720
on 70s consoles, and they are all set up to wear, first of all, for games that didn't

50:33.720 --> 50:40.080
require electricity, like Lincoln Logs.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.520
That's not a game.

50:41.520 --> 50:48.120
I'm going through everything, but it's also got freestanding games like Centipede and

50:48.120 --> 50:53.980
Space Invaders, and home consoles with, actually even there was one table that said set up

50:53.980 --> 51:00.200
like a 1970s living room with a sofa facing a large wooden TV set.

51:00.200 --> 51:12.240
And it had an Atari console plugged in with cartridges and everything, Telstar, and as

51:12.240 --> 51:19.520
it started there, it actually moved on through towards more modern era systems too.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.560
Just I guess to show how video gaming has evolved.

51:23.560 --> 51:29.680
And then they were having a lot of people bring in their private collections to loan

51:29.680 --> 51:34.600
some of their systems in for the project, and basically sort of like how our classic

51:34.600 --> 51:36.800
gaming expo was, if you remember.

51:36.800 --> 51:39.760
I was going to say, it sounds like the museum, the classic gaming expo.

51:39.760 --> 51:47.000
That's exactly what I think it was like, but it even had a full 80s era arcade that had

51:47.000 --> 51:52.600
a bunch of games and exhibits set up, and they were all in free play.

51:52.600 --> 52:00.560
And if anyone, if it's still going on though, if anyone lives in or near Chandler, Arizona,

52:00.560 --> 52:04.520
we would definitely appreciate if you would actually go get us some pictures from this.

52:04.520 --> 52:05.520
Awesome.

52:05.520 --> 52:06.520
We like pictures.

52:06.520 --> 52:07.520
Yes.

52:07.520 --> 52:09.520
I'd appreciate if you stole something from me.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.520
Remember, remember.

52:10.520 --> 52:13.120
But we didn't tell you to do it.

52:13.120 --> 52:20.440
Remember, if you value your soul, don't bother playing the Fairchild Channel F. It sucks.

52:20.440 --> 52:21.720
So noted.

52:21.720 --> 52:22.720
So noted.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.520
Duly noted.

52:25.520 --> 52:30.240
There's a game that's, I guess, coming out in Europe that's kind of interesting, and

52:30.240 --> 52:35.480
unfortunately this is a rather old article, but I thought it was interesting anyways.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.880
Music Monsters.

52:36.880 --> 52:44.500
It's a new music game being developed by publisher Joe Wood, and it combines kind of like, Owen

52:44.500 --> 52:48.380
Dunn with Jam Sessions and Band Brothers.

52:48.380 --> 52:49.380
And it's kind of neat.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.380
You have like...

52:50.380 --> 52:51.380
That could be neat.

52:51.380 --> 52:53.360
Basically, the gameplay is just like Owen Dunn.

52:53.360 --> 52:56.600
There's little circles that you see that appear you have to tap with your stylus.

52:56.600 --> 53:01.760
But as stuff goes along, it's kind of walking you through playing music on like, they have

53:01.760 --> 53:06.080
a harpsichord, and then it goes to this weird tripped out guitar thing.

53:06.080 --> 53:10.440
And as you're playing the game, it's kind of like BeatMania a little bit almost too,

53:10.440 --> 53:15.320
where you'll play the guitar part, then you'll play a keyboard part, etc.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.640
But they have stuff in there.

53:16.640 --> 53:25.280
There was, I believe there was a Depeche Mode song in there, the ones I saw in there, also

53:25.280 --> 53:32.120
other than that, Final Countdown, and there was the, was it Numa Numa, or something like

53:32.120 --> 53:33.120
that?

53:33.120 --> 53:34.120
Oh god.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.800
Is that the song that the fat kid dances to in that YouTube video?

53:36.800 --> 53:39.320
I think so, yes.

53:39.320 --> 53:45.760
Those were, yeah, in there as well, so no word on when that's coming out though yet,

53:45.760 --> 53:50.920
but soon, hopefully soon, maybe the Halloween time or something like that.

53:50.920 --> 53:51.920
Maybe more at E3?

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
Who knows?

53:52.920 --> 53:53.920
Maybe.

53:53.920 --> 53:54.920
Maybe.

53:54.920 --> 53:58.720
Alright, well, probably the worst kept secret in the gaming industry, speaking of E3, was

53:58.720 --> 54:01.320
that, hey, there's a Rock Band 2 coming!

54:01.320 --> 54:05.680
So it was finally made official this week, Rock Band 2 is coming, and IGN ran this big

54:05.680 --> 54:11.100
article about the whole thing, they had an interview with the lead designer of Dan Teasdale,

54:11.100 --> 54:14.800
and this is the cool thing about Rock Band 2, anything that you downloaded in Rock Band

54:14.800 --> 54:17.920
1, the download content, you are going to be automatically able to use in Rock Band

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
2.

54:18.920 --> 54:19.920
Nice.

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
Very nice.

54:20.920 --> 54:23.320
And hopefully it's not one of those cases where it's all already on the disc, kind of

54:23.320 --> 54:24.320
like they did with the DDR games.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.320
I don't think so.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.320
But I don't think so, there's too much of it.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.120
No, I think they just made it compatible with the songs that you download, because each

54:29.120 --> 54:33.520
song that you download is like, you know, 60, you know, 30 to 60 megs, so.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.080
I think it's great.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.080
So there you have it.

54:36.080 --> 54:40.920
And by the way, also a quote from Teasdale, we've also secured what I can easily say is

54:40.920 --> 54:43.680
the best setlist I've ever seen in a music game.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.440
Oh really, sir?

54:45.440 --> 54:50.560
Well some of that best setlist apparently leaked out this week in a YG4 TV, oh, gotta

54:50.560 --> 54:51.560
love them.

54:51.560 --> 54:52.680
Except not.

54:52.680 --> 54:56.080
In their show X-Play, they were showing a little clip of Rock Band 2 the day it was

54:56.080 --> 54:59.880
announced, and here's the thing, if you know how to pause your screen at just the right

54:59.880 --> 55:01.440
moment, guess what?

55:01.440 --> 55:06.560
You can see part of the song list, and it includes, let's see, Dream Theater, System

55:06.560 --> 55:13.360
of a Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fru Fighters, Kim Wilde, Kids in America, that was a DDR

55:13.360 --> 55:21.600
game, Motorhead, Cheap Trick, Journey, thank you very much, Win, The Who, Pinball Wizard,

55:21.600 --> 55:23.080
which, there you have it.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.140
Everlong, fuck yes.

55:25.140 --> 55:26.920
That sounds pretty awesome.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.880
And then even more Rock Band 2 songs apparently came out.

55:30.880 --> 55:36.600
This one, I mean, it's one thing to have the freeze frame on G4 TV, that's pretty obvious,

55:36.600 --> 55:41.360
but apparently now also a user at the forums at Score Hero apparently has spent some time

55:41.360 --> 55:42.800
with Rock Band 2.

55:42.800 --> 55:46.520
This one, slightly bigger grain of salt, but this, I don't see why any of this wouldn't

55:46.520 --> 55:47.600
be real.

55:47.600 --> 55:53.080
Linkin Park, Mega Death, Rage Against the Machine, The Guess Who, Lenny Kravitz, it

55:53.080 --> 55:58.000
could be either one, because this American Woman is the song, Billy Idol, White Wedding,

55:58.000 --> 56:02.600
that is badass, Alanis Morissette, You Oughta Know, I never thought I'd see that in a music

56:02.600 --> 56:06.400
game, that's gonna be awesome, that's my favorite, I never thought I'd see her in a video game,

56:06.400 --> 56:09.720
Jethro Tull, it could, Aqualung.

56:09.720 --> 56:16.960
Either the Thin Lizzy or Joan Jett version of Bad Reputation, Alice in Chains, get this,

56:16.960 --> 56:22.920
evening is better, this is where I start to go, this is too good, Soundgarden with Spoonman,

56:22.920 --> 56:27.120
and get this, Jamie, this is the best ever.

56:27.120 --> 56:29.880
Not quite, because you can use your Radiohead download content at least.

56:29.880 --> 56:32.480
The Go-Go's, we got the beat.

56:32.480 --> 56:35.760
I think I'm gonna take the Alice in Chains with the big grain of salt because the song

56:35.760 --> 56:39.880
featured is Man in the Box, I don't know how they would censor that.

56:39.880 --> 56:42.720
Well they censor it in the regular game, you never know.

56:42.720 --> 56:46.000
Well it doesn't matter, Journey is there, that's an automatic win.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.000
Automatic win?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.080
I mean, Say No More?

56:48.080 --> 56:51.680
I think Jethro Tull was there, automatic win.

56:51.680 --> 56:54.520
Proof that flutes do belong in a rock band.

56:54.520 --> 56:57.920
Jethro Tull for the win, hi.

56:57.920 --> 57:02.480
And Hit Stun in Chat says, actually yeah, I'd play that Alanis Morissette guitar part,

57:02.480 --> 57:06.880
that was like her most rockin' song, that would be great for a rock band.

57:06.880 --> 57:09.160
And Dreadlock Lord says, are these rock bands?

57:09.160 --> 57:10.160
Yes.

57:10.160 --> 57:11.160
Some greats in there.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.720
I just can't believe that she wrote that song about Dave Coulier.

57:12.720 --> 57:16.360
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about Like a Prayer?

57:16.360 --> 57:17.920
God, I hope not.

57:17.920 --> 57:19.560
No, there's any God in Heaven, no.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.560
I've never in my life gotten over that.

57:21.560 --> 57:25.200
I didn't even know behind the music, I discovered it.

57:25.200 --> 57:26.200
Did you see the other ones?

57:26.200 --> 57:28.240
You're all welcome to go Dying of Fire, what's that?

57:28.240 --> 57:30.600
The other rumored track lists or whatever.

57:30.600 --> 57:35.040
So we've gone from little grain of salt to medium sized grain of salt to now big grain

57:35.040 --> 57:36.040
of salt.

57:36.040 --> 57:38.920
This is big grain of salt.

57:38.920 --> 57:44.560
There was some leaked track lists, first one I guess is from some guy named Demp, a commenter

57:44.560 --> 57:53.240
on 8BitFix, and he says he's got, I guess someone that saw it via an email source or

57:53.240 --> 57:54.240
something like that.

57:54.240 --> 57:58.120
Anyways, it's like a fourth hand hearsay they said.

57:58.120 --> 58:05.840
Here are some of the tracks, ACDC, Let There Be Rock, AFI, Lance Morissette, which you

58:05.840 --> 58:10.920
ought to know on there, Alice in Chains, let's just read the important ones.

58:10.920 --> 58:19.720
Beastie Boys, Beck, Blondie, Devo, The Donnas, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, this is too good

58:19.720 --> 58:20.720
to be true.

58:20.720 --> 58:26.320
If that is the real list, win for Rock Band, game set match.

58:26.320 --> 58:30.000
Oh my god, lit with her one hit wonder of my own worst enemy.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Okay, big grain of salt.

58:32.000 --> 58:38.880
Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, no this is too good.

58:38.880 --> 58:44.480
Let's see here, and then they had another one here, Loading Realities, another one,

58:44.480 --> 58:48.800
they had some other songs.

58:48.800 --> 58:55.920
Presidents of the USA with Lump, Bon Jovi, no this is a fanboy list, it's got to be.

58:55.920 --> 58:59.640
If it's the real one, I am so sold.

58:59.640 --> 59:04.560
That's gonna be good, and you know what, I bet you it's only a few more weeks away, E3,

59:04.560 --> 59:07.640
they're gonna announce some stuff about it, there was also some rumors that there's gonna

59:07.640 --> 59:12.580
be some additional hardware, optional hardware stuff for you, I don't know if like Effector

59:12.580 --> 59:16.800
Pedals or something like that, that's gonna be involved, but you know.

59:16.800 --> 59:21.840
But sadly, neither Loki nor Dark Sakura will be doing any singing in Rock Band, will they?

59:21.840 --> 59:22.840
Sadness.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
No I won't.

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
Ooh, yay.

59:24.840 --> 59:25.840
Don't get me drunk, I will.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.200
Alright, sounds like a plan.

59:27.200 --> 59:31.840
Real quickly before we move on, in Rock Band 1 news, or will be Rock Band 2, because it's

59:31.840 --> 59:35.500
download stuff, some new stuff coming out for the Rock Band download content, some Red

59:35.500 --> 59:40.960
Hot Chili Peppers songs, Tell Me Baby and Snow, Hey Oh, and Rush, Closer to the Heart

59:40.960 --> 59:43.200
and Working Man, that's pretty awesome.

59:43.200 --> 59:47.520
Also The Who, they were gonna try to get the entire album Who's Next, but unfortunately

59:47.520 --> 59:51.360
the master recordings weren't all available, so you get something even better, it's a best

59:51.360 --> 59:56.080
of The Who, and it's a ton of freakin' songs, Amazing Journey, Baba O'Reilly, Behind Blue

59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.200
Eyes, Eminence Front, Going Mobile, Leaving Here, Real Good Lookin' Boy, Seein' Sand,

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.680
Who Are You, and live versions of my generation, Summertime Blues and Young Man Blues.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.640
So for Who fans, you're ready to go with that, that's great.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.960
I gotta ask, where the fuck is the Nirvana we were promised?

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:12.960
Who cares?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.280
No, no, forget the Nirvana.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.280
Where's the weird Al?

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.520
He has original stuff, come on now, where's some weird Al?

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.580
Something big at E3, you can betcha, something big at E3, whether it's Weird Al or Nirvana,

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.580
we shall see.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.260
So, but you have more rock band news, right?

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:34.360
That I do, Mr. Rob, as in, we played a bunch of it at my house, no I'm kidding.

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:41.620
There's actually a number of bands that are in talks to do different music games, Frontline

01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:48.200
Music Label, of course there's Aerosmith, some of the other groups in talks are Guns

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:55.120
and Roses and Van Halen, who were wanted to put out music games, and there's also the

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:03.800
Eagles and Steely Dan have agreements in the works, so we might be seeing quite a number

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:13.920
of other really big names, but there's actually one group that's never gonna do it, and that's

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:20.400
Led Zeppelin, because they don't want anyone to touch the master recordings.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:24.560
I think they're just being bitches about it, how about you?

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560
They're bitches.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560
Too much hot.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.360
I don't know.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:36.920
Well, let's see here, in other news, completely unrelated to rock band, Firmware 2.40 for

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:43.600
the Playstation 3 was released last week, and immediately pulled back down because there

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.600
were some issues with it, but 2.40 of course, as you may remember, was the one introducing

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:57.200
the brand new trophy system, as well as in-game cross-media bar, and custom soundtracks and

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:06.280
all that fun stuff, oh well, but there's obviously a problem and they're working on fixing it,

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:12.680
and hopefully it'll be up again soon, but there was some other stuff I heard about that

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.880
was kind of interesting though, they're gonna do, well they have some updates already for

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.400
some of the older games that have come out to add trophies to them, which is pretty cool.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:26.800
I don't know, I think right now these trophies don't really mean much to me until I think

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.120
Home comes out and you can actually display them.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.880
It's like, oh, hey guys, we fucked it up, let's try again.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.640
Yeah, I saw Scott Reuben was having some issues with 2.40.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:45.120
And we had in chat, Rob 2B says, thank god I waited to download it, and Zappi says, it's

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.560
fine, I've used it since Wednesday, so it sounds like the problem's sporadic.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.360
I wonder if it's a certain model of PS3s that's having the issues, because you know they've

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360
had different types.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:03:00.760
They've had the ones that can play PS2 games, the ones that can play, so, hmm, alright,

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:04.240
so did you check out the firmware yourself, Loki?

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.240
I'm sorry, I skipped out for a minute, nope.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
Not having it?

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
No.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:14.880
I don't really care, because I haven't played a game on my PS3 for a long time.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:17.680
I don't think my PS3's been on in like three weeks.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.680
I use it for movies.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.120
But the next game that we're getting is the initial T-Came anyway.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
Nice.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.640
By the way, the trophies that are gonna be the big part of 2.40 whenever they get the

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:33.660
working version out, apparently there was an earlier statement that every game would

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:39.160
actually have trophies in it, but that probably only meant the actual first-party games, because

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.080
you know what, the third-party publishers, some of them say they're not gonna go back

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.760
and put trophies in the games, because they've moved on to bigger and better things.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:49.520
For instance, Insomniac, one of the bigger developers, they are focusing on Resistance

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:53.800
2, which I guess that would actually be a first-party, because Insomniac developed the

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.040
game for Sony, huh?

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.120
They are focusing on Resistance 2, they are not gonna be putting trophies in Resistance

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.520
or Ratchet and Clank Future.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.680
They may, well, it's just not their biggest priority right now.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.440
I mean, big deal.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440
Get over it.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.880
SSJ100Matt says, the trophies are a lie.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.120
Indeed.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:18.240
And by the way, also adding to the list, Call of Duty 4, Civilization Revolution, not right

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.560
now for trophies.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.760
Maybe in the future.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:25.720
Unless they're yanking our chain, which is possible, who knows, but I somehow doubt it.

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:29.600
What do you guys, out of curiosity, you guys here in studio, what do you think about trophies?

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.440
Is it something needed, or is it just, like, whatever, or what?

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.800
It's kinda neat, but I haven't even really figured out what all that means, like, you

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.000
know, I know there's different trophies you can get.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.400
There are different, like, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.680
I don't know what any of it means yet, because I haven't played a game that uses them, so.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.680
I don't know.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:54.720
It's just, it's neat, but it's not gonna, like, I think with the 360, I'm more inclined

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.320
to buy games and stuff, because it's like, ooh, I got all these achievements and stuff

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320
like that.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.240
Or at least to play them to their, you know, end.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:09.040
But with the Playstation 3, I'm not really interested in it, I mean, as far as buying

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.120
games to, you know, play them for their trophies.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.840
Maybe when home comes out, who knows.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.080
Well, you know, Resistance 2 I'm definitely gonna buy, but.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.560
Xenocore has a good point in chat.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.260
Ratchet and Clank has its own trophy system, don't need the ones on the PS3.

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:25.180
Game Guru says, trophies, like achievements, are meh.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:28.600
And Tigerclaw says, geez, just when we have to deal with achievement whores, now we gotta

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.160
deal with trophy whores.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.840
Wait until those houses open up in home.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.840
That's when you're gonna see the trophy whores.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.800
My Billy has gotten all these trophies.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.720
That's when you're gonna see the trophy whores.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.360
Yeah, but she's still got no life, huh?

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.360
Alright.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.880
Sadly, though, we can't go back and add trophies to some of the classic games from the past,

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.920
but you know what, they're better off without them.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.840
But we always like to take a moment here at the end of part A on every episode of Orange

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:55.180
Laundry and pay some tribute to the old classics, and that's what we're gonna do this week's

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:57.000
classic game of the week.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Dark Sakura, gonna go to her gaming wardrobe, dig out an old, dusty cartridge and say, hey,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
play this damn game this week.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
What game is it this week, Dark Sakura?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
This is actually a game that I think I might own, but I haven't played it in a long, long,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
long, long, long time.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.720
But it's for Osprey, who's not in the chat room.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.360
Fifty points.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:21.520
It's Ristar, which is a platform game that was done by Sonic Team.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:28.400
And if you play it, you will notice quite a number of similarities to the Sonic games.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.960
Quite a number of them.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:39.000
But it is, it's this little star who runs around, and he, you know, can move across

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.680
bars and things, you know, like monkey bar type hanging bars, and jump over things and

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:50.280
shoot things, well, land on things, really, to kill them, they're in a way.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:58.960
But he goes through different planets, trying to see, you know, trying to get through to,

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.440
I guess, rescue the star goddess.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.040
And I apologize, guys, for some reason we don't have the music tonight.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:09.000
I don't know what is causing, I may have to close Justin.tv to do that, but we don't have

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.820
music tonight, and I don't know why.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:17.120
So sorry, guys, you'll just have to, maybe Dark Sakura can hum the tune, I don't know.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.880
Music sounds very Sonic-y, anyway.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:19.880
It does.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.160
It looks very Sonic-y.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.160
The game looks very Sonic-y.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:32.480
Speaking of Sonic, I believe this was an unlock in one of the Sonic collections?

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:40.840
It was, it was in the Sonic Mega Collection Plus on PC, and had a Game Gear release, too.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:48.000
It also was, it's available on the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, and also available

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.720
on the Virtual Console.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.760
But as you go through the game, your health is actually registered in stars, and each

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.360
hit is one star, is that right?

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.280
No, it's the little theme song, because sadly, Ristar wouldn't work.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.280
Sorry, guys.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:11.840
But you also, as you gain momentum in running, you get sparks of stars that go behind you,

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:19.920
and it's called Shooting Star, and so you can fly in different tricks, but it's a pretty

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.920
neat little game.

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.520
It had some differences from the Japanese to English versions.

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.120
Planets had different names in the English version.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.000
English one, in the Japanese one, he ran around with a very happy face the whole time, except

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.440
during a boss battle, and in the American one, they gave him the angry face the entire

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.560
time that he had during the boss battles.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:49.000
There's also a skiing sequence that was added to level five in the US one.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.840
Ita Mora was a giant cat in the Japanese version, which changed to an ice monster.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.840
There's anti-gravity shoes in round six, different treasure names.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:04.880
The European version of Ristar actually took advantage of larger resolutions that were

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:09.400
available on PAL systems.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.360
And actually, the third game on the Game Gear version is, if you play the Japanese version

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:20.320
on an American Game Gear, the third stage is missing.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320
It just vanished.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.320
It went away.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.320
Pretty much.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:28.840
But then again, if you play, what was it, Burning Street that was on Genesis, if you

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:35.240
put your Japanese cartridge into a US system, either by a converter or whatever, it changes

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.240
to Street to Rage.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240
Nice.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.040
But it was put out by Acclaim, and it was pretty fun.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.040
Alright.

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.480
It got a 9.5 by GameSpot.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:53.120
Ristar is your classic game of the week, and you can check that out on just about any Sonic

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.680
Mega collection that's out there.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680
Sonic Team!

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.520
Game Guru is clarifying, Ristar was available on all the Sonic Mega collections, GameCube,

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.720
PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.240
So it's out there, waiting for you.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.380
It's a Sonic Team game, it may as well be Sonic.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.880
And sadly, it's the only way you're going to hear the music, thanks to our failure this

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:08.880
week.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.320
Go on and find it.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.600
I was going to mention, there was another game that they had gameplay footage of come

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.240
out this week, and that would be Wario Land Shake It.

01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:24.040
And what's funny is that game looks very much like Sonic.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.960
It's weird.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.960
Could be interesting.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.760
Could be very interesting.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:29.760
Alright.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.440
Well, that's going to do it here for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.640
with plenty more, and we've got some fun stuff planned for part B. We're going to play the

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.080
match game tonight with all these people in the house.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:42.580
You know that's going to be fun.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:46.500
One chatter and one caller will get to go head-to-head in the OLR match game, and plenty

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.500
more gaming news.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.720
We haven't even touched, barely, the Xbox 360 and some of this stuff, but we'll get

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.080
to all that when we come back after this break.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.480
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice

01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.480
a week.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:12.440
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
