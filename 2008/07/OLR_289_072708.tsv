14039	19165	Tonight, July 27th, 2008, will some Nintendo controllers soon be banned?
19605	21968	Is an official HaloCon in the near future?
22448	24811	And a PC gaming service has gone free?
31567	35150	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35170	40873	We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
40994	47078	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47469	50090	Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron.
50110	52811	So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic-Con.
52831	54031	Happy, happy, happy, happy.
54131	54611	So what's this?
54631	55652	They're making a new Tron.
55792	56192	Yes.
57252	57732	Just Tron 2.
57872	58993	And Jeff Bridges is in it.
59233	60353	Yeah, I saw that in the trailer.
60533	61253	And he looks evil.
61534	62694	What was up with that trailer though?
62714	65855	Like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away.
66254	67415	Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed.
67435	67815	Buena Vista would.
95410	95630	Hmm.
95810	96150	Remember?
96371	97272	Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that.
97332	100256	So, I would use that as sort of a past precedent.
101057	102138	Yeah, but still, what are they going to do?
102178	104321	There's like thousands of people at Comic-Con.
104461	104922	You know what I mean?
104962	105863	Especially in those panels.
106003	110228	As far as I can tell, though, this cell phone video was the only thing that I've seen.
111049	111250	So...
111863	112283	Interesting.
112303	113484	Well, whatever they're doing, it works.
113644	115105	But I've never been to Comic-Con.
115166	115706	Maybe next year.
116326	116947	I'm going next year.
117167	120009	The one and only Miglatov, you've probably heard on this show.
120049	120730	He was at Comic-Con.
120750	122731	He was giving me calls pretty much every day.
122991	125373	He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face.
125954	130237	I bet he was intensely... Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while?
130337	130917	Yeah, kind of.
132138	132398	All right.
132739	135240	Speaking of jerks, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
136141	136561	Just kidding.
137562	137962	Hello.
138222	138782	I'm doing fine.
139102	140663	Were you just watching that little preview for Tron 2?
140703	145646	Yes, I had to because I was reading up on it, but I didn't know that they actually had filmed it.
145766	150468	Of course, you have to assume that anything that says do not film, someone's going to film it.
150688	150968	Exactly.
151008	153689	Especially something as widely anticipated as that.
154670	155310	Hey, just think about it.
155350	159032	It'll make a great video game, except then again, there was a Tron 2.0 video game.
159052	159812	That doesn't stop anybody.
159832	160493	Didn't do very well.
161233	162894	I think they should go ahead and try again.
164053	171398	There's a better freeware or shareware light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while.
171418	172419	It's really, really good.
172579	172919	Cool.
173639	175501	I remember Surround on the Atari 2600.
175741	176661	That was just light cycles.
177262	177822	I remember that.
178683	189670	Anyhow, if you want to join us in our chat room, we are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number 289 of our podcast, Damn World.
190391	193413	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you want to
194553	195674	Join in with the chat.
196734	199415	And I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now.
200135	204737	And some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy and all that stuff.
205297	213860	And some people are commenting about how during the previous show, the Bobby Blackwolf show on All Games Radio, Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was the Bobby Blackwolf show.
214861	216001	Some people in there commenting on that.
216401	218162	If you want to hear that, you've got to listen to Bobby's show though.
218202	219662	He's available at allgames.com.
220503	221483	Click on Bobby Blackwolf show.
222503	222803	Gaming Week
247815	248817	I played stuff, actually.
248877	250679	I did finally start Aurora Faint.
251319	252561	And that game's freaking cool!
254585	255546	I don't know much about this game.
255586	256666	Tell us a little bit about Aurora Fate.
256726	257767	It's an iPhone game.
258408	260169	Oh yeah, okay.
260349	266533	It's sort of like how Bejeweled does, except you can only move them horizontally.
266954	270276	But you can sort of slide as you destroy groups.
270296	272938	They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does.
273378	279142	But you can actually move blocks off to the side and move them that way, move them laterally into empty spaces.
279622	281944	So it's sort of a neat thing, and
282364	288762	You can level up and learn new techniques and it's a very cool little game and very pretty and shiny.
290652	298978	and I played this other thing called Color Spiral, but all it is is just drawing really awful circles on the iPhone, so it sucks.
299418	301899	And I got a Sudoku game, just to try it.
302800	307683	I got, it's just called Sudoku Free, and it actually, it's kind of neat, really, you know, easy.
308344	310065	As in, really easy.
310665	311946	As in, eh.
312506	315268	But it's pretty, the interface is pretty.
315448	316429	You can choose your color.
317219	318339	Aurora Faint Battle Maneuver
340424	343786	It sounds a little like Meteos with the whole sideways only movement thing.
343846	344787	You'll have to give it a try.
344807	345527	You'll have to give it a try.
345567	347949	You can actually make a character on my phone if you want.
348109	348489	That's cool.
348569	351030	Or one of these days I'll finally break down and buy an iPhone.
351271	351731	One of these days.
352631	354412	I hear people are still lining up for that stuff.
354553	355093	That's crazy.
355993	356634	But also, I...
359800	361322	I downloaded something else.
361642	366106	I actually think that I might, though, try... This was it.
366146	367668	I was about to download Ms.
367708	368148	Pac-Man.
369309	373794	And apparently, it's utter crap, so I didn't do it.
374454	377917	Because there's no real good way to control it.
378718	379259	I can imagine.
379739	381521	They should do Marble Madness for iPhone, though.
381541	383383	If they can do Monkey Ball, they can do Marble Madness.
383843	384263	Good times.
384623	386684	But Monkey Ball sucks on iPhone, just letting you know.
386944	387224	Really?
387564	387764	Yes.
388125	390605	You have to play just right.
390685	400409	Instead of holding your phone at a perfect flat angle, you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position.
401069	403010	So it's really...
405046	406746	Not good.
408167	416029	I also did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been, because I've been doing a lot of homework.
416849	420350	I did, though, get some fantastic nerd time yesterday.
420370	425931	It wasn't video game related, but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it, and it pissed me off.
427600	430001	I watched a whole crap ton of Stargate SG-1.
449704	450425	I was like, don't make me smile.
450445	452406	You made me take your picture in front of the giant Stargate.
453107	453607	That's right.
453667	454828	That was awesome.
455208	459752	I love me some Stargate, except I do not like Stargate Atlantis.
460112	460592	Not very much.
461593	464515	Before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show, any other games?
467017	467117	No.
468018	469219	Not that there's anything wrong with it.
469279	470220	The Game of Life.
470871	471452	Do we know a bigger nerd?
471492	471792	I'm kidding.
471832	472213	Hi, Travis!
472333	473254	You're great!
491288	493790	Magnetica I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and
521158	529406	I gotta say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I don't really care for the new 3D graphics.
529586	535132	Especially when they have all their, like most of the cutscenes are in-game using the in-game engine.
535452	541198	And when you get really close to some of those characters, man, those textures are really low res.
541658	543440	But overall, it's pretty good.
545743	555013	I played also Korg 10 DS, which isn't really a game, but more of an actual piece of synthesizer software.
555733	561319	So I played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10, I didn't really make much with it.
561820	562360	But it's fun.
562500	564582	It'll be cool to play around with.
565363	566625	And then on the 360...
568697	569438	Wario Land Shake Wario Land Shake
588365	595087	A perfect example of how they can do really good 2D platform games now with the technology that's out there.
595527	596947	All hand-drawn animation.
597647	599148	They have anime cutscenes.
600188	600788	It's really cool.
600968	601548	It really is.
602348	611351	And sadly enough, if only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game at E3, they might have actually saved their little press conference.
611451	613111	But, whatever.
614871	616872	And then, let's see what else did I play...
617964	619426	I think that was about it, actually.
619886	620567	It was pretty brief.
640167	640747	or hell, even 12.
642208	647590	I love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS.
648070	652052	It's kind of interesting because the difficulty, you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty.
652112	658414	If you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2 American like I did, you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty.
658654	665417	You know, you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and just, you didn't really have to grind or anything like that.
665477	667637	You do need to do a little bit, not a lot.
667697	669178	I mean, that gets annoying in role-playing games.
669298	670399	You don't have to do a lot of grinding.
670419	675143	You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't getting completely overpowered by the enemies.
675163	681848	You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you, the speed of how they're attacking, and all of that.
682108	686211	You can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game, and it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience.
686772	688933	Also, you have the new translation and everything.
689874	692196	I really like that they put voice acting in the game.
692236	692976	It's kind of neat.
693057	697160	Even though it only shows up in a few select scenes, they actually pull it off on the DS pretty well.
697920	711911	it's not A plus level voice acting but it's not terrible it does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years my biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki I don't like the graphics I don't like
712631	714953	The look, very much, of what they've given the game.
715033	717855	It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game.
718055	720477	It feels very choppy.
720978	723119	It feels like even Final Fantasy VII looked better than this.
723339	728924	The cutscenes don't have the same style of graphics as the actual game itself.
728944	734968	The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just cartoony.
735008	736850	It's not like Final Fantasy VII where...
738351	744531	The graphics were kind of cartoony but the cutscenes, the characters were also a bit cartoony as well.
745478	746959	It's just it doesn't match whatsoever.
747019	751461	You go with this really super deformed-looking character to ultra-realistic.
751541	756084	I don't know what it is, but I would have almost just preferred redone sprites.
756264	758545	I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games.
758905	762727	Those games are beautiful, and they're still sprite-based, but they look amazing.
763207	767470	I really like the look on those, and that's kind of what I almost wish this had been.
767910	771472	And I see GameGuru in chat is saying, just get Final Fantasy IV Advance.
771512	773173	I mean, yeah, but that was just basically...
774013	775155	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
791435	815043	and you can you actually get to Kaipo the desert town you kind of can play your first you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons that will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands and you actually level it up through these silly little ds games like the math game which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game maybe it's just the nerd in me I don't know but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game I like the whole map
815643	816103	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
835420	840602	in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's Prey ability, Cecil's Darkness ability.
840923	844484	These things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters.
844904	850647	That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on Advance, maybe with a new translation.
850887	856770	I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD-based system, even PS2.
857910	858650	Thanks for watching!
875700	876601	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
903584	903884	OLRDS HATERS
918661	919662	No, I'm not a DS hater.
919702	923224	I like the games that are kind of made for a DS, like Trauma Center.
923405	923945	Great game.
923985	925586	You can't play that really anywhere else.
925606	927708	I mean, I guess you can on the Wii, but that's a whole other story.
928108	931851	Cooking Mama is actually kind of fun on the DS.
931871	938756	There's lots of these types of games on the DS, even things like Metroid Prime Hunters and stuff that you can't really get on other types of systems.
939076	946782	I don't like trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of how to control a game.
948280	949180	And that's the other thing.
949280	953182	That's my other big problem with Final Fantasy IV is that it needs an analog stick.
953822	959105	Trying to control Cecil, which all these years I thought it was Cecil, but according to the voice acting, it's Cecil.
959405	965688	Trying to control Cecil in that 3D environment where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees, it sucks.
965728	972711	Because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little, you know... I don't know if there were other...
973251	973811	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
992837	1012278	so play a little more at least until you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know how many people I know are going to get this game although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy, fangirl it's worth checking out especially if you've never played the game you've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great
1013419	1019920	But if you have played the old games, you know, have already kind of made your way through them, I still say it's worth a look.
1020261	1026562	It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper, because it's a $40 DS game, but it's not going to be a waste of your time.
1026862	1028682	It is, you know, kind of a different experience.
1029283	1030383	So, there you have it.
1031403	1036304	And then Bobby in chat commented again, he said, confirmed, OLR likes to debunk Black Wolf.
1038345	1039065	Oh, Bobby, you're great.
1041457	1048782	GameGuru says, look, every port or remake of a NES and Super NES for the DS means no PlayStation Network or Virtual Console port, and that makes me mad.
1049543	1051064	I kind of agree.
1051705	1059891	I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade, if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 recreations are any guide, because those were great.
1060431	1062993	I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone.
1063433	1067976	I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people, but I would like to see...
1068997	1070258	A new approach taken to it.
1070358	1071979	I just kind of don't want it on the DS.
1072219	1076962	I'd like to see it as a remade for at least the PS2 if nothing else.
1077022	1078743	Make it a budget title for the PS2 if nothing else.
1078763	1079884	There'll be tons of people that want it.
1081574	1088777	Also in my gaming week, I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more Civilization Revolution, which is a game I think is pretty cool.
1089057	1091759	And I noticed Bobby Blackwolf was playing Civil Revolution.
1091799	1099342	Speaking of Bobby, he was playing that quite a bit this weekend, so I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on Civilization Revolution.
1099382	1101303	Even though I'm not that great at the game, he'll probably beat me.
1102143	1104124	Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it.
1105084	1110909	Um, and, uh, also I've been playing that new, um, Xbox Live Arcade game that came out.
1110949	1115032	The, uh, um, the street dancing game, whose name I accidentally closed the window at.
1115072	1115452	What was it?
1115472	1119235	The Go Go Beat... Let me look up.
1119635	1120596	Go Go Beat Steady?
1120776	1121676	I think that was the name of it.
1121816	1122437	I had it earlier.
1122857	1124919	Uh, I played, obviously you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of it.
1124939	1126140	Go Go Break Steady, that's the name of it.
1126560	1128982	Uh, I played it for a little bit, and, uh...
1130274	1131556	I kind of like the concept.
1131696	1138524	I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this Guitar Room Man style, you know, buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside.
1138564	1142108	And the better you hit them in rhythm, then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma.
1142449	1143630	And I kind of thought that was cool.
1143930	1150218	It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game.
1151018	1170938	but I know there are people that do get excited for that so I'm glad there's a decent music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone it's worth checking out but I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music I think it could be kind of cool so that's it for my gaming week
1172110	1172570	and DarkSakura.
1196144	1197265	Thank you for watching!
1217065	1219546	Alright, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
1220007	1220407	Sure.
1220547	1221267	Alright, alright.
1222288	1233874	Well, being that E3 was not really this week, but last week, there's been a lot of either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it.
1234514	1244680	And a couple publishers, one being Bethesda, has been trying to defend E3, saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit.
1245360	1245500	And...
1247761	1253369	What they've been saying is before it used to be very bustling, lots of people in there.
1254090	1258076	But now it's just vacant and not that many people come and visit them.
1258136	1259698	And I think Bethesda, I mean, they're not...
1260586	1273773	A small publisher by any means, but at the same time, I remember when you guys visited Bethesda, their booth wasn't that big, not compared to EA or Microsoft or something like that.
1274233	1282297	So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more, a lot of people might miss going to visit these smaller publishers that are there.
1282877	1283618	So that kind of sucks.
1284238	1285699	Thanks for watching!
1302086	1309469	DarkSakura and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out.
1309989	1310769	That was great.
1311410	1319433	Unfortunately, it was one of those games that was awesome in theory, but the execution, unfortunately, by the time the game actually came out, it didn't work out so well.
1319473	1321393	But we got excited about it watching it.
1321553	1322694	It was great in theory.
1323034	1324694	I actually taped the whole thing.
1324754	1327576	How they recreated the Arathacon battle was pretty awesome.
1327616	1328136	God, I know.
1328176	1328796	That was sweet.
1328976	1330297	But yeah, anyhow, sorry.
1330838	1333340	But they just say that it needs to change.
1333400	1341266	They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they want to change it, but I don't know.
1341486	1348011	But EA, another company also displeased with the current E3.
1348632	1355998	Ironically enough, though, they're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now.
1356578	1358540	They wish to invite the community to the show.
1359858	1361183	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1365100	1366981	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1390959	1391619	But it's just interesting.
1391659	1394500	It's not stopping from EA.
1394580	1400983	Now here we go, another person at EA kind of speaking up saying, gosh, we missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place.
1401063	1404764	But Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got... I don't know.
1404984	1405564	Let me put it this way.
1406004	1409885	And I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with this because they haven't gone to E3 and they want to.
1410866	1412746	I don't think that they should let the public into E3.
1412786	1417388	Because as it was, it was so fucking packed before that...
1418154	1426463	you know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts you're not gonna get anything done what they need to do is find some happy medium between the old E3 and the new E3
1427392	1453705	so maybe lax up the amount of people that they're allowing to be invited to these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking E3 anymore because it's just too strict but before there was people like Walmart employees that work on their garden section just because Walmart carries video games they got into E3 you know weird shit like that if they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there then I think it would be a little bit better um
1454881	1456662	I don't know about adding the public.
1456742	1460205	I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff.
1471013	1474116	Be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's going to be fucking mobbed.
1475037	1475677	I got to say this.
1475717	1476918	This is very interesting, the comments.
1476978	1479921	Again, I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving us good stuff tonight.
1479961	1481923	Bobby in our chat room at chat.org.com.
1482223	1483884	He says, Peter Moore loved the community.
1484205	1488128	Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiast press last year when Peter Moore was in charge.
1488508	1490530	This year, they didn't really care about us as much.
1490810	1496996	And it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very – they're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are –
1497756	1499598	Way more out there with the community and everything.
1499618	1502761	I mean, heck, you can get an OLR gamer pick on the Xbox Live Marketplace.
1503501	1504482	That's saying something right there.
1504542	1509026	If our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world, you know what I mean?
1510347	1512449	It kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community.
1513270	1513990	Kind of interesting.
1514591	1521237	But, you know, like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how... Okay, let's...
1521937	1523859	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1546724	1550626	I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness.
1551367	1563694	Honestly, I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only, but make it kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in.
1564035	1570378	I think that will really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, namely us.
1570819	1574421	But it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees.
1574801	1575561	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1596810	1597690	I think everybody does.
1597811	1599631	So why not invite retail?
1599651	1604634	It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know some of these years it's hard to see everything.
1605014	1614018	I think that the way that they do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see everything and then you can decide what you need to go see further.
1614698	1615158	I like that.
1615318	1617920	I like that a lot because that works for the gamers days.
1619280	1620361	Digest all the information.
1620401	1625183	The publishers can make sure that the people that they have the information that they want out there
1626252	1643942	and if they want to further show it off maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes but hey, this game is playable at our booth, go check it out or hey, let's set up some times to come visit the booth and play the game
1645137	1646038	Alright, well let's move on.
1646078	1662409	Talking about more E3 kind of fallout, because obviously, you know, I know it's been a couple weeks now since E3, but it is one of the highlights in the gaming year, and of course Nintendo got a lot of flack for their E3 press conference, and what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of...
1664130	1670055	I don't know if you want to say they apologized, but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception.
1670355	1672917	In fact, Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week.
1672977	1673197	Quote,
1689349	1691030	An interesting apology of sorts.
1691711	1699276	But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true?
1699296	1700377	I guess.
1700457	1701157	Or at least now.
1701177	1704700	It's just upsetting because all they showed was games for casual people.
1704820	1705160	I mean, no.
1706061	1706341	I hate...
1707476	1713820	Distinguishing games between casuals and the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays.
1715382	1719205	But seriously, Wii Music is like an over-glorified toy.
1719265	1720946	There's no depth to it whatsoever.
1721366	1722127	It's just crap.
1722167	1726610	But, Loki, you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chitotown Wars.
1726650	1728071	Now that is a hardcore game.
1728111	1728832	But see, that's the thing.
1729072	1730133	The logo, Loki...
1730473	1734037	Exactly, but that's one thing that got me excited about it.
1734257	1738182	They don't actually have to show anything, just say, hey, we're working on this.
1738302	1742947	I mean, look at a couple years ago, they were showing off a video for Mario Kart Wii.
1743207	1745169	It didn't come out for two years after that.
1745850	1747692	Same with The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
1747712	1751937	They had a really early teaser video for it a few years prior to that, and everyone got hyped.
1752117	1754939	Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3.
1755520	1760724	All they have to do is say, you know, that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the final product.
1760784	1761545	It was great, though.
1761565	1763086	It was epic in the making.
1763487	1771073	It showed nothing in the actual in-game footage, but it was epic and theatrical, and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3, even though it didn't come out for a while.
1772194	1777098	Sony, God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name.
1777658	1788143	here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick I don't remember her name the new one that replaced Perrin Kaplan or whatever that's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on
1789795	1792217	I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games.
1792657	1800462	I mean, I honestly... She may play the DS and play the fucking Brain Age shit, and she may be one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer.
1800703	1807227	But that's the problem, though, is because they don't play these games, and they don't necessarily have to play a lot of games to be able to... Yeah, that's not their job, though.
1807247	1808488	Their job isn't to make the games.
1808708	1814392	It isn't to make the games, but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their audience.
1814452	1815712	That's what they should do, because...
1816853	1817754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1833888	1835329	But they didn't have to do that much.
1835829	1837290	I mean, they just said, oh, Pokemon.
1837330	1838190	Okay, this is coming out.
1838230	1839651	They could have showed a trailer for that.
1840031	1842892	They could have shown Wario Land Shake.
1842973	1849896	There's a perfect example of a game that can be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player.
1850076	1854378	Let me ask DarkSakura, because she's been awfully quiet through this, but I'm just kind of curious of your opinion, DarkSakura.
1854878	1861902	Did Nintendo really make a misstep with this E3, or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place?
1864335	1867658	I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing.
1868398	1876565	Just because they obviously addressed the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market.
1876645	1879087	Because that's the whole big thing with businesses.
1879127	1881209	You want to increase your market share.
1881589	1888755	They know if they release a Zelda or a Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market.
1890396	1891157	We're already loyal.
1891177	1892598	I'd be preaching to the choir.
1893818	1915785	I think where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince and I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this if they're trying to convince this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press you know I think that
1916685	1917286	and DarkSakura.com.
1943134	1947576	Because they pretty much realize that we already know they're working on something.
1947596	1956880	They don't have to go and make some sort of claim that, you know, oh, we're doing this when they know we want to keep these gamers, we're going to put out this game.
1956900	1962362	That goes without saying, there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete to give us.
1962642	1963202	But you know what?
1963583	1967566	My wife knows that I love her, but she likes to hear it every now and again.
1967726	1970728	So this is exactly why we have to do this.
1972430	1974591	We may assume that they're doing this stuff, but you know what?
1974631	1977994	If we don't see it enough, we may not assume it anymore.
1978074	1980316	So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore, Loki?
1980356	1980796	Is that what it is?
1980836	1982437	Yes, I think that exactly.
1982617	1983358	We need to be cuddled.
1984699	1990743	Okay, we have no more Sega systems, yet we keep getting Sonic games.
1990803	1992844	Sega knows where their bread and butter is coming from.
1993545	1998008	Nintendo hasn't succeeded this long.
1998388	2003972	They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon-eating, chain-to-the-jungle-gem morons.
2005372	2006913	No mention name of people.
2007674	2007934	But...
2009455	2038499	I think that when it and they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they have parameters they have to keep in mind I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out they know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market
2039219	2041200	But your core is going to come to you every time.
2041560	2057824	But see, I want to see if this actually works out for them because the problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now, the mom and pops that bought the Wii system to play Wii Sports, now they're anticipating, okay, well, they're going to buy this Wii Sports resort thing.
2058524	2062785	I hope that's true because if it's not, they're going to end up with another fucking...
2064045	2064786	Thank you for watching!
2081701	2089287	But, you know, my thing, and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know, yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a freaking bone.
2089527	2102936	Like, for instance, if we know that in the new Zelda game, Link is going to ride a gigantic spider, then, like, show us the image of Link riding a giant spider and, you know, put out there, Link and his giant spider friend coming next fall.
2102976	2107720	You know, give us something to, and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go...
2108200	2110121	Oh my god, did you see the giant spider?
2110821	2112142	Exactly, that's all they had to do.
2112182	2113123	Look at Mario Kart.
2113183	2114583	Like I said, this is a perfect example.
2114663	2115224	Mario Kart.
2115524	2119746	They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a kart, racing around.
2120106	2120586	That was it.
2121047	2124388	Nothing from the game, no graphics whatsoever.
2124468	2128330	It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that, oh my god, Mario Kart's coming.
2128711	2133573	And it's not like we didn't see Mario Kart coming, because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system.
2134134	2134394	So...
2135254	2138998	But still, that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate.
2139638	2147786	Another Mario game, for all I know, it could be a crappy, and you know this is gonna come anyways, like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf.
2148226	2150408	But once again, that's not a hardcore game.
2150628	2155853	That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking Wii to play Wii Sports.
2156033	2158055	Stop catering to people that play Wii Sports!
2158476	2159437	There are other games out there.
2159637	2160778	They sold their systems, didn't they?
2161378	2162099	Yeah, that's true.
2162599	2162999	You know what?
2163039	2165120	We would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports.
2165180	2167061	I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability.
2167201	2168102	Just one little thing.
2168582	2169783	This is where it comes down to.
2170523	2171063	Bottom line.
2171704	2171984	Money.
2172684	2182789	What company is out there... If they were out there to, I guess, be nice and sweet and cuddly, they'd be a not-for-profit organization.
2184350	2187692	As it is, they have to make money.
2188552	2194735	What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America your mom has more money than you do?
2196076	2204039	Well, we've done selective targeting for certain products, and we feel that the adult demographic would be... Okay, go ahead.
2204079	2205340	I want to say this, though.
2205580	2207080	Shaoran in chat is great.
2207240	2208721	He has a title for my new Zelda game.
2208841	2211042	It's called Legend of Zelda Web of Lies.
2212523	2213003	All right.
2213643	2217205	What I was trying to say before is that they probably see something, oh, well...
2218143	2221425	To expand our market, we're going to appeal to a different demographic.
2221445	2225327	We're aiming towards the older people who might have been our core group at a younger age.
2225347	2229949	We're trying to reclaim the market that is now, quote, grown out of video games.
2230410	2232010	You need to go get a job.
2232130	2235952	Rob, why do you think that I was in technical writing for a while?
2236093	2236433	Very nice.
2236553	2237994	All right, Loki, final thought, then we got to move on.
2238014	2238414	My final thought.
2239386	2240607	Basically, it's like this.
2241267	2243549	It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market.
2243589	2249393	The problem is, though, is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't going to necessarily do a lot of good for you.
2249813	2268265	The problem is, you've got to get people confident in your platform because come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4, you're not going to have a lot of people wanting to buy your next system
2269588	2270168	Thanks for watching!
2287338	2288719	and that's where you're going to end up hurting.
2288779	2289760	It's down later on.
2289920	2301449	I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the JustinTVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read but I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about in there some folks are saying Pokemon MMO is what's needed.
2302654	2304935	I can't believe it hasn't already happened.
2318103	2331235	Well, for an example, actually, a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok Online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture your different creatures as your pets, and then once they become loyal, they help you fight.
2331715	2335559	I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually, you know...
2336039	2339980	If they can do it on a regular video game, why can't they have it in a multiplayer format?
2340020	2343661	And then you have, for example, you have your arena system.
2344062	2346962	You can actually have your gyms be set up that way.
2347763	2351444	And you've got whoever has the best group or whatever.
2351784	2354825	So you have a continuously rotating list.
2354925	2357186	And maybe your gym leader is one of the GMs or something.
2357966	2359166	Anyhow, let's move on.
2359206	2361207	I think it's very, very possible.
2361227	2362927	I know we have more Nintendo news.
2363107	2364148	Hey, stuff about Reggie.
2364668	2364928	Okay.
2366078	2370060	Reggie is like, okay, we know, pretty much.
2370080	2382347	He said, from an America-centric perspective, to quote, that Wii's storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like WiiWare and Virtual Console.
2382747	2387470	And he told MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution.
2387950	2389991	So he says that Nintendo is working on something.
2390411	2394073	They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something.
2394733	2394974	But...
2397921	2419125	I actually think that they're going to... And while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB-based, knowing Nintendo, they're going to try to do something proprietary, something that can't be mimicked, something that no one's going to be able... Well, in theory, no one's going to be able to break and just, you know, hack their own like we used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives, remember?
2419727	2420548	DarkSakura.com
2440089	2448478	I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you it'll be something really simple that could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done.
2448598	2451040	It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing.
2451301	2454424	Just open up USB to use storage devices.
2454804	2456406	Your problem's solved right there.
2456526	2461371	It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer, I mean, it's no different than it is now.
2462830	2463170	I'm sorry?
2463350	2464610	Where's the money for them to make from that?
2464770	2465931	They don't have to make money off everything.
2465951	2474233	On the official Nintendo USB drives that they'll release in stores along with that for $10 more than the generic brands will cost.
2474313	2476893	I still think they're going to have some way to system lock it.
2476953	2487096	Even if they do it via USB, they're going to have some sort of code that you have to read off of the storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only.
2487196	2489798	I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing to hack the system.
2490259	2492080	I seriously think that's the case.
2492241	2494983	That's why they're going to try to protect their investment.
2495904	2503110	From a business perspective, they're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their pocket.
2503130	2509035	Or let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system.
2509076	2509616	Well, they were...
2509616	2510956	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2533188	2536432	Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades.
2537834	2539556	I mean, think about it.
2540197	2541939	This is my prediction.
2542660	2547906	We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii.
2548307	2551430	It's either going to run off of USB or have some sort of
2552491	2559416	So either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage whatever with the Wii.
2559997	2565340	And then as it progresses, we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something.
2565501	2577269	Maybe the new upgrade, they drop the price of the old Wii, bring out the new Wii at the regular price, the storage becomes even more cheap as the time goes by, and we're going to get a new Nintendo.
2577289	2577449	Yeah.
2577449	2581752	See, that's why I don't understand they can't do that now, because the price of flash storage has gone down so much.
2582052	2587136	They could just say, okay, going forward now, all the Wii's that we put out are going to have 4 gigs of storage instead.
2587456	2589597	Yeah, it'll piss off a lot of people, but you know what?
2589938	2590238	Tough.
2592279	2592560	Alright.
2593780	2600885	At least Reggie admits the problem is out there, even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that.
2601226	2603167	The whole American-centric perspective.
2603847	2605989	At least they're finally admitting there's a problem.
2606354	2610837	Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from.
2611457	2616240	And this is, at least as far as I've seen too, has been mostly the American market.
2616500	2620243	So, I think he's saying, well, at least Nintendo of America loves you.
2622328	2623169	It's our cuddle, Rob.
2623369	2623849	Interesting.
2624389	2625350	Maybe that was our cuddle.
2625410	2625770	I don't know.
2626431	2626791	We'll see.
2628512	2629732	Smack him in the fucking face.
2629793	2630253	Seriously.
2630733	2631073	Oh, yeah.
2631113	2632474	We acknowledge there's a problem now.
2632614	2634755	Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that.
2634775	2635876	Loki needs a little love.
2636196	2639878	Would he be so angry if somebody would just... Oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people.
2640119	2641319	Oh, that would be awesome.
2641439	2646522	I think that Loki needs something that starts with a D and ends with an E. And it's two words.
2646863	2647763	And it's called duct tape.
2649444	2661031	Loki, my only wish is that you take your little media badge at this event that says Orange Lounge Radio and you put a sticker over it that says Bobby Blackwolf Show before you go and interview these people.
2662918	2663738	I'll take it a step further.
2663758	2664739	I'll put my name as Bobby Blackpool.
2664759	2670941	We're just going to have someone follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking point, we'll be like, okay, interview's over.
2671221	2671481	Next.
2671541	2672402	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
2673482	2674963	So, speaking of next, Rob.
2675103	2681245	You would love it if I just put on a mask and dress up like Captain Anger or something like that.
2681365	2682786	You could be Mr. Furious.
2684199	2685079	Alright, let's move on.
2686420	2697003	Apparently, because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing, that certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market.
2697683	2701924	These would include any Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks.
2702424	2710166	So, any of your classic controllers, your GameCube controllers, those are going to be taken from the market.
2711387	2711527	And...
2713581	2718063	Of course, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck are okay because those only have one analog stick.
2718683	2733370	And this is all because of that wonderful $21 million patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and Escape that has sued them.
2733590	2736811	And, you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money.
2738212	2739052	Or licensing rights.
2741360	2742501	Do you think it's actually going to happen?
2743001	2743401	I don't know.
2743421	2750246	It's, well, I mean, they have to pay them because it's, you know, the verdict has been placed.
2751186	2752287	The thing is, though, there's... Appeals.
2752667	2753708	Well... Second level appeals.
2753748	2754608	Supreme Court appeal.
2755629	2761212	Well, Anscape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make...
2763292	2766096	I don't honestly think that they're going to try to make controllers.
2766136	2767057	I think they just want money.
2767077	2768198	They would have kind of done it by now.
2769881	2774467	Lord Katsuhito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat.orangehunter.com Probably.
2775208	2775688	Most likely.
2776009	2777090	It's usually the way these things go.
2778715	2786744	Anyways, Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii Bonus Content feature very soon over in Japan.
2787245	2794293	It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16-digit code into this bonus thing, and you get a new...
2794753	2795853	Present, so to speak.
2796613	2800974	The Wii Speaker Channel is the first thing that's supposed to be using this.
2802135	2810376	It's coming with that game on the Nintendo DS, I think we talked about it a few weeks ago, that is kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio translation of channels or whatever.
2811577	2811997	Interesting.
2812237	2816818	But there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for...
2817358	2824082	WePoint, free download games, virtual console, sell virtual console games in stores.
2824462	2827905	Kind of like what Xbox Live does with their own redemption system.
2828105	2832627	You can buy Uno or Texas Hold'em in a store on a card and give it as a gift.
2833988	2835029	I don't think that's what this is for.
2836290	2837671	If it even comes out here.
2838651	2842674	Yes, and I think the only thing this is, it's to deter piracy.
2843556	2848041	because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately.
2850003	2857311	Ironically enough, though, all those bonus things that they're talking about, like the Wii Speaker Channel, link to the internet anyway, so it's not gonna matter.
2859756	2866703	Well, there is something that I think is going to be very, very, very cool to come out.
2866763	2867523	At least in Japan.
2867784	2868965	I don't think we're going to get it here.
2870286	2874710	But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the Purika, the print club stuff.
2875451	2876632	But it's actually not quite.
2876712	2881276	It's called the Digicam Print Channel that's going to be on the Wii.
2881376	2883518	It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm.
2884219	2884499	Where...
2886220	2901310	You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and you can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book that's 1,575 yen or you can get a Mario one that's 2480 yen.
2907753	2934268	and you can actually even have them printed out to well you can have your Meishi printed out which is a Japanese business card it's like your name card basically the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it but you can have your Meishi with your Wii on it not your Wii but your Mii on it for 500 yen for 30 cards so it's actually pretty cool I wish we could get something like this
2934488	2938289	Would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game I have on those cards too?
2940210	2941811	I don't see why not.
2941851	2942891	I mean, I would think so.
2942951	2947252	That actually would be a very smart idea to have your friend code be on there.
2947272	2948953	See, both you and I need to be working at Nintendo.
2949153	2951374	But I'll tell you what... In the good idea department.
2951554	2958156	And I'm going to link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down, but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube.
2958996	2959977	And I'm looking at it.
2960037	2962017	It's actually pretty cool.
2962037	2962798	This is actually a...
2963918	2966280	Fuji Films demo showing how it works.
2966820	2973966	It's really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes and have messages on them.
2974026	2975066	It's actually very cool.
2975447	2977368	And also send them to people.
2978169	2979430	It seems pretty cool what I'm seeing on this.
2979690	2980931	Do you think it's something that would work here?
2981271	2983673	Or is this better for Japan's culture?
2984284	2994837	I think it's more surrounded around, I would say, how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right.
2995680	2996140	Why not?
2996641	2999843	I mean, if the channel already exists, it's just translation.
3000023	3006769	And on Fujifilm's end, or whatever company they partnered with in America, just a matter of a process.
3006789	3007889	Fujifilm's got a big presence in America.
3007909	3008990	I was going to say, Fujifilm's here.
3009270	3009851	So why not?
3009871	3010271	Snapfish.
3010431	3014555	As long as they have a presence of getting the... Are they behind Snapfish?
3015015	3015375	I don't know.
3015635	3017117	I'm just mentioning Snapfish.
3018217	3023602	Every photo company has had to evolve to maintain competition with digital photography.
3023942	3025223	So I'm sure they have something set up.
3025583	3045015	The way that I see this is that if rock bands are going through rock band to have their musical presence fortified in the industry when everything is digital download and all that, then why can't the photo companies make use of this?
3045375	3046276	I think it's a good idea.
3048081	3053545	GameGuru in chat says, Damn, sooner or later they will fill the Wii with just channels.
3053685	3057408	Kind of a good point because the Wii only has four screens worth of channels.
3057428	3058509	I want the channel channel.
3058569	3060331	The channel channel?
3060351	3061412	The changed channel channel?
3074164	3079949	No, unfortunately they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to store all those channels.
3081050	3082251	Yeah.
3082471	3085894	Alpha Cananograms in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP.
3086554	3089437	Big fan of the whole Fujifilm channel idea.
3090177	3090538	Alright.
3090578	3090978	We will see.
3092179	3095302	Well, this isn't for the Wii but it uses the Wii remotes.
3095702	3102548	There is a brand new homebrew game made called Dark Room Sex Game and what this basically is
3103088	3127128	is two people will take the Wii remotes and they will kind of make a kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the pornographic sounds there's no images it's just all audio that you hear on the screen and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8
3128948	3133092	I wish I had brought my Bluetooth adapter.
3133172	3135215	Next week, though, we can maybe do this on the show.
3136196	3139639	You know, for that extra... It's all audio anyways.
3139819	3140500	It'll be awesome.
3141441	3141801	All right.
3141961	3144324	Yeah, Gold Banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat.
3144364	3145545	Weirdest homebrew ever.
3145885	3150170	But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there, I believe.
3150530	3150831	They have...
3153010	3170200	It's the website, itu.dk slash stud slash darkroom And GameGuru in chat says the kind of obvious comment here Why not, you know, have sex?
3171641	3177425	Because this is safer, you can't contract babies or AIDS Oh, okay, I see
3179558	3181119	AIDS and Baby Free, I get it.
3181179	3184360	So there's, I guess, the positives of playing this game.
3184380	3189481	Unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had, in which case you could probably, yeah.
3190741	3192422	You might be able to get genital herpes.
3193362	3194182	Herpes maybe.
3194282	3196863	Using the proper attachments.
3198023	3202985	All right, well, please, let's change the topic real quick here and talk about Castlevania.
3204258	3204798	Thanks for watching!
3226793	3227234	DarkSakura.com
3256253	3257814	And then there's another button where your thumb is.
3258954	3267837	So apparently, and that thumb button is used for items later in the game, you stand in a designated spot, you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game.
3267877	3269798	I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things.
3270138	3278661	And then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out and they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them.
3279361	3280421	So that's kind of neat.
3281182	3284082	And then of course the weapons like knives, they do take hearts just like the game.
3284342	3285103	That's like 25 hearts.
3285123	3288143	So it sounds like a shooting game with a Castlevania twist on it.
3288424	3290364	So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii.
3290944	3291524	Possibly.
3291664	3294405	There's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii.
3294885	3295305	Rumors.
3297026	3298726	I think that there's more than one way to do it too.
3298746	3300487	It doesn't necessarily have to be Wii only.
3301363	3302644	This sounds neat in theory, though.
3302884	3303164	It does.
3303404	3304045	That sounds pretty cool.
3304065	3309008	Speaking of Silent Hill, I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now.
3309268	3310769	I know Comcast is nationwide.
3310809	3318314	I don't know if their On Demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the On Demand and HD for free on Comcast On Demand.
3318354	3321597	So I actually watched it this weekend with William.
3321757	3324478	Well, he'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all.
3324518	3325699	He needed me to explain it to him.
3326039	3327020	So we watched it, and I did.
3327080	3327981	But I'll tell you what.
3328041	3330803	Silent Hill and HD, very, very hot.
3332164	3333646	is a very good looking movie.
3334748	3338654	I still like Silent Hill as a movie and I hope the rumors of the sequel are true.
3338674	3338954	I hope so too.
3342173	3343814	Well, how about some release dates, Rob?
3344335	3344955	How about it?
3345635	3355541	Well, for the 30th in the UK, we have Double D Dodgeball on Xbox 360 and Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 on Xbox 360.
3356922	3359063	On the first, though, is a whole crap ton of stuff.

3370169	3377840	SBK08 Superbike World Championship on some systems and Soul Calibur 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3379923	3380203	Cool.
3380243	3380824	Sounds pretty hot.
3381505	3382065	In the U.S.,
3383479	3384900	We have a few things coming out this week.
3385161	3388363	Soul Calibur 4 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3388964	3392227	Spectral Force 3 on the 360 from Atlus.

3476530	3478050	Going over to the PlayStation 3.
3478130	3482511	They're also getting Soul Calibur 4, of course, on the 31st.
3482711	3484911	And they are also getting the Special Fighting Stick as well.
3485371	3489512	And if you want Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PlayStation 3, guess what?
3490012	3490432	Here you go.
3490512	3491732	It's coming out in Japan this week.
3492113	3493613	Now, going over to the Nintendo Wii.
3494213	3496413	Not a lot of games I've heard of before, but they do have it.
3496513	3499034	Dokopan Kingdom for Wii is coming out on...
3500294	3505135	The 31st, as well as We de Tokotan Kanji Nu is coming out as well.
3505575	3509516	And Zero Geshu no Kamen comes out as well this week.
3509576	3512957	And that game looks to be like a little bit of a survivor horror type game.
3512997	3514397	So this game actually looks kind of cool.
3515997	3517658	Kind of looking at some of the CG from the game.
3517718	3518638	It's like crazy.
3518678	3519658	Fatal Frame 4.
3520038	3520758	Is that what this is?
3520858	3521119	Yeah.
3521759	3522839	Ah, it's their version of Fatal Frame 4.
3524278	3526260	We de Tokuton Kanji no Looks like...
3545240	3549443	I think it's like a... It looks like one of those 200... 250 games in a game type thing.
3550083	3550723	Looks a little weird.
3551424	3553085	Alright, probably not so many people going over that.
3554106	3554606	Other systems.
3554626	3556687	Let's go to the handheld systems and see what's coming out in Japan.
3556707	3557708	I'm sorry, first, PlayStation 2.
3558508	3560009	Drastic Killer comes out this week.
3560449	3561590	Galaxy Angel 2.
3562070	3562991	Gino Express.

3565052	3568574	Kano-Kan Isui all come out this week on the PlayStation 2.
3569375	3571936	Going over to the handhelds and looking at what's coming out there...
3575492	3578576	Dream Baseball Doki Doki Majo Shinpan 2 Witch Hunting
3592395	3592916	Wow.
3593436	3594337	They actually made a sequel to that.
3594357	3594637	Look at that.
3594657	3598761	The top screen is her face and the bottom screen is her boobies on the DS there.
3599101	3601163	That's Doki Doki Majo Shinpan 2.
3601363	3602644	All in the name of fighting witches.
3603505	3603745	Yes.
3605167	3608249	Also coming out, Rhythm Tenku Gold comes out this week on the DS.
3608630	3614375	Steel Princess, Tozoku Ojo, Windy Cross Windom comes out as well.
3615116	3616957	Lots and lots of DS releases this week.
3617298	3617798	PSP.
3619319	3620439	Looking at those releases.
3621180	3622500	A little bit going on over there as well.
3622580	3625701	Phantasy Star Portable being the most notable of the releases in Japan this week.
3626341	3631983	Panic Palette Portable and Ginga Ojosoma Denutsu Collection.
3632363	3633083	Ojosoma?
3633343	3635044	Yeah, it's the PC Engine Best Collection.
3635084	3636024	It's Princess something.
3636764	3638385	It's a PC Engine Best Collection.
3638425	3640305	It's three PC Engine games.
3641746	3642826	I'm not sure what games they are.
3642846	3643546	That looks familiar.
3643566	3644447	I just don't know what that is.
3644627	3644887	They're...
3646377	3647478	That looks so familiar.
3647658	3648598	Yeah, it looks very familiar.
3648618	3651940	There's something, I don't know if it's come out or coming out, though, that I want from overseas.
3652140	3652720	Hmm, what's that?
3652860	3657183	That's the Fantasy Zone collection.
3657343	3658423	I think we've covered it before.
3658563	3661425	They're shooters, just so you know.
3661445	3661605	Yeah.
3661625	3662606	That's really familiar.
3663066	3664186	I probably have a couple of them.
3664206	3667108	All right, well, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.
3667148	3668889	Busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan.
3669941	3683993	Well, speaking of other busy events, is that there has been a little, I guess, controversy regarding a lack of Halo information, from what I understand, at E3.
3687170	3714039	but they actually were saying that Halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote, big enough at this point that it can stand on its own so there are a few hints going around they've mentioned Comic Con and other conventions that there might be a HaloCon in fact, let me see if I can't get this name
3715925	3744354	just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy well but it was I guess one of the higher ups saying that you can do a HaloCon nothing on the scale of Comic Con but you could bring a few hundred people to see a Halo thing if there were a Microsoft and Bungie endorsed Halo tournament Uber thing I bet people would come it depends where they have it Rob, I'd go
3745598	3747079	Well, it would depend on where they'd have it.
3747699	3747819	I'd go.
3747839	3748319	You know what I mean?
3748359	3751280	I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it.
3751320	3752901	But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive.
3752981	3753721	Maybe even L.A.
3753981	3754422	Heck yeah.
3754822	3755142	Who knows?
3756322	3758463	Well, HaloCon, possibly coming soon.
3759224	3761224	I see they kidnapped the press to bring them to that.
3761464	3763485	You know, scare the crap out of them.
3763505	3763865	That would be fun.
3763885	3764986	I want someone to cosplay Master Chief.
3766158	3769281	You'd think there'd be Master Chief cosplay at HaloCon, I would hope.
3769661	3771442	And Cortana and all your favorite Halo characters.
3771462	3776947	And people dress up like Star Wars characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is.
3778027	3778448	I don't know why.
3779577	3780318	Thanks for watching!
3799457	3799978	and DarkSakura.
3823416	3825617	Actually, I heard another interesting rumor.
3825797	3826678	Three is awesome.
3827238	3828399	I think you're thinking the same thing I am.
3828419	3828899	What did you hear?
3829420	3840706	I heard the rumor that the games that are cross-platform enabled, like Shadowrun and... I want to say there was another one, Lost Planet.
3841887	3847990	Those, if you have an Xbox 360 version of, you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now.
3849211	3850612	And that may lead the way to more...
3853377	3853777	things.
3853997	3857159	Possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox.
3857179	3858219	That could be very interesting.
3859719	3860100	We'll see.
3860380	3864781	Is it because it's probably just competition from things like Steam and other products that exist, you know, out there.
3864881	3869483	All these kind of competing portals for games on PC, so to speak.
3870323	3872624	It's Lost Planet Colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform.
3872944	3874185	According to Actdeft in chat.
3875530	3879015	I like free, so that's pretty cool, except I don't really play Halo on the computer.
3879536	3886566	Same thing, the silver accounts on Xbox Live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit.
3888596	3889377	Mega Man 9 Box Art T-Shirts
3913052	3941923	and it is the same classic cheesy box art with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art it's like someone at Capcom got the joke in other words well they're actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon
3942663	3943083	Awesome.
3943564	3945065	Did you see the other one that they put out?
3945105	3949409	Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other... Meatbun.com, I think was what it was.
3950550	3954833	It was the 1942 pin-up girl thing with Cammy.
3955294	3955794	That shirt?
3956114	3956935	Oh, I saw that.
3957015	3957535	Not as funny.
3958076	3958736	I ordered one.
3959737	3960078	You would.
3960538	3962440	That was the other game I played on Xbox Live this week.
3962480	3963981	I didn't even talk about it.
3964001	3963981	1942.
3964461	3967564	Now that's how you remake a retro game for Xbox Live.
3967744	3968465	That's all I have to say.
3968585	3975591	I only played the demo, but I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port I have in a long time.
3975871	3977573	Other than maybe Pac-Man Championship Edition.
3978534	3983378	So, just check that out if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases.
3983618	3986361	Because 1942 was pretty awesome, I gotta say.
3987529	3990751	I like the 1942 Kai.
3990891	3991612	That was a good one.
3991692	3994613	But I want to see the 1940XX ones remade.
3994633	3995254	Wouldn't that be cool?
3995634	3996595	That would be really sweet.
3997575	4010883	But going back to the whole retro side of things, there's a hint that Igarashi is planning on doing a new Castlevania in 2D for Wii on WiiWare.
4011544	4012604	That's going to be pretty cool.
4012624	4013565	Yeah.
4015422	4024007	It's supposed to be trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the Castlevania series.
4024728	4034534	So he says that he's going to pay attention to how Mega Man 9 is with the market and base his decision on that.
4034854	4035775	So that's smart.
4036398	4039339	I like this trend Mega Man 9 seems to be starting.
4039719	4039959	Yeah?
4040259	4041379	This could be very good.
4041699	4043440	I think it's like, you know... It could also be very bad.
4043660	4049661	We love our 2D, but no one wants to really admit it in the 3D market until someone just says, ah, screw it, we're doing it anyway.
4050281	4053082	And they're like, hey, they're making money on this.
4053602	4054382	It's safe.
4054482	4056923	For very little money into it, you know what I mean?
4056943	4058123	So let's do it!
4058383	4061144	I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it.
4061184	4062384	I just don't understand why they don't...
4063211	4063851	Thanks for watching!
4078342	4079662	Could we make money too?
4080182	4082843	Could retro goodness be a money making machine?
4083183	4085564	Now the problem, hopefully the pool doesn't get diluted.
4086044	4089784	Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything.
4090165	4090545	I don't know.
4090565	4096606	I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means they actually have to work on it.
4097266	4104588	Versus I don't know, just like porting something from like PlayStation 2 or the GameCube.
4105908	4106128	True.
4107437	4115603	This is something that's pretty exciting, and I don't know why I'm excited about it since I, up until a couple weeks ago, didn't know what the hell The Watchmen was.
4116784	4118926	I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it.
4119466	4120987	Although I am interested in reading it now.
4121087	4124370	But anyways, at Comic-Con they announced that they're going to be making...
4125351	4128656	Watchmen Episodic Games on the PC, PS3, and the 360
4140514	4155825	and they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storylines so that's kind of cool and they showed off some footage of it and the first kind of level that they showed off was with Night Owl and Rorschach and it was kind of
4157165	4157765	Thanks for watching!
4179415	4179815	Looks good.
4180276	4180756	Can't wait to see it.
4181277	4187782	TigerClaw in our chat room wanted to point out, Loki, Warner Brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of The Watchmen on iTunes.
4188082	4189243	The first chapter is free.
4189743	4190023	Cool.
4190804	4193906	So if you're into The Watchmen, this is a very happy period of time for you.
4195087	4200653	Also a very happy period of time for Geometry Wars fans Because Geometry Wars 2 is coming And guess what?
4201074	4211765	Unlike most Xbox Live Arcade news we usually have It's coming earlier than anticipated That's great news It's coming this week, July 30th is the big day for Geometry Wars 2 The bad news...
4212386	4213846	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
4240211	4247678	None of the multiplayer is online anyways because with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online.
4247798	4248198	That's true.
4248999	4252221	Bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on Xbox Live for the new Geometry Wars.
4252261	4252662	Yes, there is.
4252702	4253943	I downloaded it and checked it out.
4253963	4254643	It looks pretty neat.
4255204	4258847	I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat.
4259448	4261249	The graphics have this kind of adjusted...
4262310	4265491	I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what, but I have a feeling this might be the final product.
4265511	4270372	This adjusted soft tone to them that makes it look like an old Vectrex game or something.
4270392	4273353	It looks like they put Vaseline on the camera lens.
4273793	4277634	But it sounds better than Loki's describing it.
4277654	4280635	It gives it a real soft look to it that gives it an old 80s game flair.
4280675	4281316	So it's kind of cool.
4281696	4282076	I like that.
4283076	4283316	Alright.
4283336	4286157	Wouldn't that be awesome to have Geometry Wars on a Vectrex?
4286337	4287677	Like someone to do a homebrew game?
4287837	4288398	You never know.
4288538	4289358	People are pretty crazy.
4290206	4294628	Alright, this is now the part of the show where we're going to take a quick break.
4295048	4297129	But not until we get to the classic game of the week.
4297149	4301651	Because we always, before the break, like to talk a little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness.
4302011	4306373	Which, how appropriate, following a story about Geometry Wars 2, which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming.
4306833	4312395	DarkSakura is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out.
4312475	4313416	And this week's title...
4314016	4314336	DarkSakura.com
4329972	4340295	The classic game of the week is a game that was on the Neo Geo systems put out by Saurus is the developer.
4341236	4342196	It's called Shock Troopers.
4343116	4344917	Shock Troopers is really freaking awesome.
4346037	4353120	Um, basically, imagine how, like, a plane shooter game would be, except you're running on the ground, and that's what you've got.
4354380	4362624	Um, you, um, basically you can, uh, fire your guns in, uh, eight directions, you can strafe, you can, um...
4364145	4369792	If you attack point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and extra life, things like that.
4370233	4372796	You actually have a dodge button, too.
4373417	4379064	There's a team battle mode where you can pick different soldiers in the game and everything.
4381807	4394961	And actually, one of the cool things about this is that it was actually... From what I understand, it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to Metal Slug.
4395181	4399346	So that's actually pretty cool, even though it completely is in a different...
4400667	4402168	I want to play this game as Big Mama.
4402188	4402869	That sounds awesome.
4426929	4436176	As you go through the game, you can actually pick a different path, the jungle, mountain, or valley, and you can switch to a different route or continue on the same.
4436776	4439858	So it's basically sort of a running gun sort of game.
4439918	4441620	Cool, the guy has a flamethrower right now.
4441640	4442480	Looks like Ikari Warriors.
4442500	4443661	Yeah, it looks like Ikari Warriors.
4443681	4445062	Yeah, it is a lot like Ikari Warriors.
4445082	4445803	A lot more souped up.
4446796	4460384	and there's also one called Shock Trooper Second Squad that's supposed to be standalone, no connection, and you can only choose four characters and it has no team mode.
4462265	4472291	It's also a little bit more cartoony and the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them because it's actually, well, it's completely 2D, the 3D graphics are pre-rendered, so...
4473709	4476411	There's actually a release on PlayStation 2 and PSP.
4477651	4478252	So that's pretty cool.
4478672	4482454	It was actually, we got it in North America through the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.
4482675	4484075	And now you can get it on the Wii, too.
4484716	4485396	That just came out.
4486997	4487277	Really?
4487718	4489819	Yeah, SNK Arcade Classics.
4489899	4491220	Oh, I thought you meant on Virtual Console.
4491240	4491720	I'm like, really?
4491740	4492140	I don't remember.
4492160	4492501	Okay, cool.
4492641	4493621	I like the music in it, too.
4493661	4495983	It's very, you know... Let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear it.
4500253	4503754	It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it.
4508476	4508956	Cool, huh?
4509237	4509817	Yeah, pretty cool.
4509837	4513258	So there it is, your classic game of the week, Shock Troopers for the Neo Geo.
4514058	4514559	Pretty awesome.
4514759	4516539	I think it was just the Neo Geo arcade systems.
4516940	4519040	Well, you know, close enough.
4520861	4521581	No, I take that back.
4521621	4522542	It did come out on the AVS.
4522602	4525063	I was going to say, couldn't you get just about any arcade game?
4525083	4526123	It did come out on the AVS.
4526744	4527724	Is it a hard to find one?
4528345	4528866	I don't think so.
4529406	4530627	I just had forgotten about it.
4530827	4531208	That's alright.
4532089	4539536	Alright, so there you have it, Shock Troopers, your classic game of the week, and we are going to take a quick break, but we will be back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4539656	4551046	Again, we are, this is probably the last time I'll remind you guys, we are one big show now, so if you're listening on the podcast, just stay tuned, and we're going to take a free break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4551087	4553028	For those listening live, we've got some music coming your way.
4553068	4553509	We'll be back.
4560131	4562312	Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.
4562773	4566875	Recently, I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.
4567235	4568576	Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.
4568616	4573639	It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day, you still have an incredibly small penis.
4594710	4595651	Gaming Radio.
4595891	4603177	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
4603337	4604678	Orange Lounge Radio.
4605679	4610863	Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4610963	4616027	We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 27th, 2008.
4617468	4623813	For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat.orangeloungeradio
4626464	4627445	All right, we're halfway there.
4627845	4629925	We've got plenty more news to cover tonight.
4630785	4631585	Let's get right into it.
4632966	4633866	Loki, start us off.
4636426	4639327	If you can put down your DS for five minutes, come back to the show.
4639567	4641668	I'm sorry, am I interrupting something, Loki?
4642008	4642868	I was just playing Core 10 DS.
4643048	4645428	There are rumors via leaked pictures of a PSP case.
4653910	4657732	saying that the PSP-3000 is in works right now.
4657772	4664894	In fact, this supposedly leaked picture is of one of the designs that they, I don't know, didn't go with.
4665555	4680801	Some of the features on this design, which may reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final PSP-3000 design, includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a PlayStation button, much like on the PSP-3000.
4681621	4684263	PS3, Sixaxis, or DualShock 3 controllers.
4684683	4686285	So, I'm not too surprised by that.
4688486	4695832	That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet, because there may be a whole other PSP coming out.
4696993	4699335	And I'm sure this one will be completely unhackable.
4700515	4702057	Oh yeah, because Sony prevented that now.
4703077	4705499	They said, we're putting stuff to this right now.
4705539	4706000	That's right.
4706020	4708642	It's only taken us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it.
4709202	4709722	Absolutely.
4709762	4710223	No more.
4711909	4712890	Well, what do you think?
4713230	4715852	Is it time for the PSP to get a remodel, or is it too soon?
4716732	4717632	Will it drive sales?
4719814	4721134	I don't think it's going to drive sales.
4721875	4724056	It might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone.
4724116	4728718	It may allow them to do more things with it, depending on what features they add to it.
4729599	4737183	With a built-in microphone, you can play crappy karaoke games, you can do the stupid stuff that they do with the DS, where you can blow into the microphone to do things.
4738544	4738864	I don't know.
4740494	4745155	Might be kind of cool to do really crappy Skype without using a headset with it.
4745595	4746215	I guess that's true.
4746235	4747696	Voice over IP, possibly.
4748936	4750196	You could do some side talking.
4750236	4754917	So, Sony fans, next time someone tries to tell you the PSP blows, you can say, yes, it does.
4756037	4756237	Right?
4757938	4759078	Or you blow on the PSP.
4759158	4759998	You blow the PSP.
4761218	4762179	You can go blow the PSP.
4765475	4767897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4788294	4789375	The Feminist Gamers
4806135	4807516	Great displeasure to Sony.
4808377	4811200	In Shakespeare, they said, quote, Congrats on your awesome new game, Sony.
4811220	4818407	I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating, heteronormative assholes.
4818747	4820088	And then Feminist Gamer...
4821129	4829015	Quote, instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with, why not go out and find gold to stuff into a treasure chest?
4829275	4832197	The more gold in the chest, the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry.
4833098	4835660	So obviously some women groups are getting very upset.
4836080	4841685	Now Titan Studios, the art director there, has actually came out and commented on the whole situation after this.
4842465	4849671	He actually said, does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look, characters, and everything is a girl?
4850492	4852574	How about they all just shut up and get over it?
4854115	4855276	Learn to be offended people.
4855397	4863144	It's not, you know, if people got their, you know, less of a stick up their ass about certain things, I think the world would be a whole lot nicer, don't you?
4865017	4867137	And notice how the game is called Fat Princess.
4867197	4869398	It's not saying, like, all women are fat.
4869558	4874099	I mean, if they put out a game called that, I can see where people might get a little bit offended.
4874499	4877879	But it's just a princess who happens to be fat.
4878479	4880620	But let us remember the Mika song.
4881060	4882480	Big girl, you are beautiful.
4884240	4886141	What's wrong with, you know, this?
4886181	4888121	This is just... It's innocent.
4888161	4890961	I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this.
4890981	4891442	You know what I mean?
4893562	4893702	So...
4894977	4897598	I'm Curious Chat Fat Princess Gets No Love Because She's Fat Fat Kirby
4918789	4919890	I see Kirby's pretty fat.
4920490	4921631	How about this?
4922331	4933419	How about lose any sort of social, you know, the only reason that I think that there's such a bad social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it.
4933859	4939523	It's like, why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop being so fucking offended?
4940103	4945307	If you don't have a problem with weight, then don't worry about it.
4945347	4946428	It's not your problem.
4947524	4949045	Don't get offended for people!
4949265	4951125	Why don't they just call the game, I Like Cake?
4951766	4952226	Perfect!
4954287	4954647	Okay!
4955187	4959289	Because seriously, if cake offends somebody, then there's just no pleasing you.
4959709	4959909	Right?
4960729	4961309	I like cake.
4961890	4962510	I like cake.
4963130	4963510	A lot.
4963690	4964871	I mean, seriously, look at me.
4965851	4968712	Alright, can we move on, please, before Loki offends me?
4970033	4970653	Well, guess what?
4971223	4972564	Operation Ground and Pound Revolution Death Squad
4999626	5003269	They're going to be 500 Microsoft points for those three.
5004589	5005470	Sounds like a good time.
5005670	5006070	Hell yeah.
5007071	5007892	I like Dragon Force.
5007912	5008332	Good stuff.
5009413	5012935	I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck.
5014676	5019539	Well, one thing not coming to the PlayStation Network anytime soon is Wipeout HD.
5019999	5022341	Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests.
5022761	5025383	The game is so hardcore it makes people have seizures.
5028532	5029292	Now that's offensive.
5030632	5051436	Yeah, apparently, I guess it's, according to computers and video games, Wipeout HD's delay is because a little bit more technical features, it's extra features, and apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy test.
5052156	5055337	Can you imagine what would happen if Sony had neglected to do that?
5055717	5057237	Like how much poop they'd be in?
5057817	5066065	In the general populace, if they had just forgot to make that kind of testing, and all these kids everywhere were having seizures because of a video game, oh my god.
5066565	5070029	I guess it's a good thing they go through all these strict tests before a video game is released, huh?
5071010	5071290	Yeah.
5071370	5071710	In a way.
5072431	5075594	It's a good thing they have all those seizure warnings on manuals and stuff.
5075654	5076395	That's true, too.
5078203	5079704	Anyhow, the Dark Knight.
5079744	5080905	Have you seen the Dark Knight movie?
5081685	5082125	Yeah.
5082165	5082626	Kind of neat?
5082846	5083746	No, and I'm not going to.
5083966	5084246	You're not?
5084266	5085127	I've decided I don't want to see it.
5085227	5085607	Why not?
5085807	5086267	It wasn't bad.
5086387	5086868	It was long.
5087168	5088288	I've decided I don't want to see it.
5088949	5089289	All right.
5089429	5090349	Well, your choice.
5091470	5092570	Movies are expensive these days.
5092711	5093811	It's $10 to go see a movie.
5094471	5096813	Well, they are making a video game based on the Dark Knight.
5097213	5097673	I'm surprised.
5098133	5100054	Yeah, I know, big surprise, that's not news, right?
5100074	5101855	But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps.
5102155	5112500	It was actually Gary Oldman in an interview kind of spilled the beans that the game was coming out, and it caused this whole little controversy where a video was out, and then it was pulled, and now it's out again, and all this other dumb stuff going on.
5112520	5114921	Not to mention that it was also leaked by IGN before that.
5115101	5118283	Well, I mean, seriously, duh, there's going to be a Dark Knight game.
5118523	5120084	Duh, duh, duh.
5120104	5124086	They've been making Batman games ever since the old NES Batman game, which was actually pretty rad.
5124586	5125807	The old Batman game was awesome.
5125907	5126987	The old Batman game was awesome.
5127027	5130689	Batman Returns, less awesome, but the original Batman game was pretty awesome.
5130889	5132790	And there's even Lego Batman and all this crap, anyway.
5133130	5148337	But The Dark Knight, kind of funny enough, it was not there at E3, but it is still coming out, and I'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the Blu-ray release of the movie and DVD release of the movie, which will be in time for Christmas, I imagine.
5148858	5153340	Gary Oldman is quoted in the video saying, quote, it's hard to make a movie like this under the radar.
5154656	5155437	Dark Knight The Game Joy
5172165	5175267	Anyway, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because I'm sick of hearing about it.
5176047	5176968	That's why I don't want to see it.
5178168	5178408	What?
5178448	5182730	I was going to say, it doesn't make it any worse of a movie though.
5182810	5183431	But I understand.
5183511	5185352	Hype machine sometimes kills things.
5185412	5190835	And we'll kind of like, you know, if you hear all this hype, this hype, this hype about something and you watch it and you go, it's good but it's not great.
5190875	5192515	And that's what a lot of people are saying about Batman.
5192836	5195457	It's good but it's not that great of all this hype.
5195597	5197198	I didn't really care about seeing the last one either.
5198358	5199139	I just saw it at home.
5199719	5200640	I agree with my husband.
5200740	5202862	I won't see one until I get a Two-Face-only movie.
5219932	5221353	I don't want to say anything because it's a spoiler.
5221413	5221993	I already know.
5222193	5223094	I'm just going to back up for that.
5223114	5223694	But I will say this.
5223734	5224275	I already know.
5224395	5226656	I also paid $10 to see Mamma Mia this week.
5226856	5227556	Now that I would see.
5228317	5230238	And I'm going to see X-Files as soon as I get a chance.
5230358	5231999	I will only see Mamma Mia again.
5232259	5232840	I'm sorry.
5232880	5235041	I heard the X-Files movie's not hot.
5235461	5237782	I really don't... It's fan service, though.
5237822	5239143	If you watch the show, you'll probably like it.
5239924	5240784	Stay through the credits.
5241284	5242845	You don't want to miss that one.
5243326	5248789	My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it, so I'm going to just see it for myself.
5249482	5249782	Fair enough.
5249902	5253083	I won't see Mamma Mia again, though, until they let the audience sing along with the movie.
5255044	5258726	Well, how about the new Dexter game that's coming out for iPhones?
5258766	5260446	Do you remember us talking about that before?
5261787	5271851	Actually, Mark Echo, who does that clothing line and does graffiti, is actually supposed to be working with it, I do believe.
5271871	5271931	And
5273732	5297092	his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an episodic content and as far as I know I do believe that Dexter is a show about a serial killer who is a splatter analysis for the Miami Police Department so it's a very interesting premise and I think the game has a good promise
5297352	5302357	He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to.
5303518	5304700	So he kills serial killers.
5305440	5306982	That's extra special.
5307503	5310526	It's on Showtime, which means it can be on movies.
5310986	5312468	Which means I won't watch it.
5313620	5317662	I think they've run it on CBS a couple times during the writer's strike and stuff when they needed programming.
5317743	5320504	But it sounds like it could be an interesting game.
5321004	5321424	Interesting.
5322125	5322425	Keyword.
5322445	5325807	I'd just like to see what episodic content they're thinking of.
5325947	5328068	And the fact it's on the iPhone, of all things.
5328328	5329609	It's interesting.
5330289	5331410	We'll see how it turns out, I guess.
5331770	5333071	Tap here to murder.
5333831	5336993	Gold Banjo in chat says, I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome.
5337879	5338900	I heard a lot of people like it.
5339060	5341463	I just, since I don't have show time, I don't really watch it.
5341863	5343625	Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to comment.
5343905	5348770	Well, last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that Grand Theft Auto 4 was coming out on the PC.
5348890	5350732	Well, now there's even more confirmation of this.
5351192	5354435	First, starting off with the PC Gamer Magazine from Malaysia.
5354455	5359400	Yeah, I know that's not exactly in the US or UK or whatever, but
5359540	5362423	Hey, it's on the cover, so that's got to say something, right?
5363804	5365786	So they had a big little article about that.
5366366	5372252	Also, there was a posting which is now removed on the ESRB website.
5372472	5374995	Apparently, no one got the memo over at ESRB.
5375835	5377137	Yes, that is entirely accurate.
5377157	5377197	Um...
5399620	5402221	So yeah, I'm sure it will be coming to PC.
5402481	5403322	It's not a surprise.
5403522	5406343	All the last few have, so it makes sense.
5406923	5408684	And this means hello hacking.
5409624	5412465	That's what I'm most interested in, is all the mods for it.
5412485	5413526	That would be awesome.
5413546	5413926	Reskinning.
5415766	5416687	Let's make predictions.
5417147	5422109	How many days before Grand Theft Auto 4 PC has a topless mod?
5422789	5424430	Meaning all the women walk around topless.
5427689	5431770	10.
5428529	5431770	10?
5429669	5431770	I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves.
5431850	5435850	Like, it'll get pirated before the game's even out, and somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out.
5436771	5437251	There you have it.
5438631	5448933	Alright, well, also coming out, and another port that's highly anticipated, although of a completely different type, it's the game Peggle, the PopCap game that's kind of like Plinko on Crack.
5449853	5450833	I don't know if you've played this game.
5450993	5454674	I really enjoy it on the iPod, and I bet there'll be a lot of DS people who like this game as well.
5455194	5455294	Um...
5455834	5456594	Thanks for watching!
5476644	5501307	and you'll have a good idea what to expect on the DS later this year and it's fun you know for a casual game it's a lot of fun it's stupidly simple you just fire a ball down the little you know playing field it's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although you know pinball has ramps and you know other things that Peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat I enjoy Peggle it's a great iPod game it's almost made for the iPod
5502946	5506388	Alright, this is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us.
5506468	5510951	It's a little segment we have here on the show called the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.
5511011	5521477	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in.
5521817	5525639	So let's open up ye olde mailbag and DarkSakura, take it away.
5525659	5526620	Music
5530171	5531772	First email comes from AZHP.
5531992	5532913	Hey, LLR crew.
5533333	5555286	With all the talk about F-Zero GX being one of the greatest racers on last week's show and eager anticipation of a Wii title being announced, I figured I'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately Miyamoto went on record saying he was extremely disappointed in how Sega approached F-Zero GX slash AX and that if F-Zero were to be made for another console, it would not be in the same style as GX.
5555806	5566512	This is probably because it was too difficult, hard, confusing, but in my opinion it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos that came with playing the game, even at the rookie difficulty levels.
5566872	5571875	The game was critically acclaimed as well and received higher than 8 over 10 for most game reviewers.
5573476	5582063	I, for one, love, love, loved F-Zero GX, and am more than excited at the thought of another F-Zero game, especially in HD, but unfortunately it probably will never come to pass.
5582203	5590530	Let's hope Miyamoto comes to his senses and greenlights this game, because honestly, how could anyone not like that game, aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something.
5591051	5597796	Keep up the great work, and P.S., I went to Disneyland for the first time in about 15 years, and I now realize why you guys trip down there so often.
5597976	5599598	It really is a place where dreams come true.
5600658	5601939	I haven't been in like a year.
5603219	5605880	I don't have my pass anymore.
5606480	5612302	But yeah, F-Zero, I mean, I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because they don't think it'll work.
5612462	5615883	They'll think of some stupid Wii feature to implement in it that'll make it worthwhile.
5616263	5616944	At least I hope.
5617084	5617664	I really hope.
5617724	5622525	Because you're right, it's critically acclaimed and gamers that bought it loved it.
5623606	5624846	I hope they do it.
5624946	5626367	I hope a miracle pulls through.
5626767	5629968	I'm not going to hold my breath, but it would just be great.
5631190	5635714	How about Miyamoto realized that maybe they should actually give gamers what they want?
5636334	5639337	Wasn't there actually a DSF-0 after AXGX?
5639657	5640498	I don't remember.
5640538	5641359	I thought there was.
5641779	5642500	I could be wrong.
5642800	5645042	It might have been before, but I seem to remember there was one after.
5646420	5648362	Well, next email.
5649262	5649983	Hi, OLR.
5650564	5652405	And this comes from Ritual Insomnia.
5652445	5653266	Actually, J-Rod, sorry.
5653346	5653766	Oops, sorry.
5654627	5660932	First off, I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones.
5661373	5664335	I work 10-hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on Fridays.
5664715	5668679	So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make Mondays easier.
5669259	5671240	I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make.
5671560	5677342	You guys had your E3 wrap-up show, which was great, but failed to even mention a huge title, Gears of War 2.
5677743	5684225	I'm absolutely stoked for this game, and you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at Microsoft's keynote.
5685105	5686866	I actually didn't think about it, sorry.
5687566	5688727	This puts me in a position.
5688807	5691368	I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not.
5691448	5692869	Well, you can't get to the ferret, so you can't.
5694289	5698331	I mean, you did make up for it by having a discussion about the new game, Silent Hill...
5699672	5701215	Okay, you used game a bunch of times.
5701716	5706104	Homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb-stomping sequel.
5707907	5711292	How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support?
5713739	5717562	Marcus says Chainsaw, Dahlia Gillespie says for me to be nice.
5718123	5719484	I don't know what to do with you people.
5719744	5723307	This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads and Breadsticks.
5723347	5724868	Now stop ripping off my signature fools.
5726009	5726810	Dude, seriously.
5727231	5728832	It's not like I forgot about Gears of War 2.
5729352	5730834	I did not forget about Gears of War 2.
5730874	5731855	This is a lot of news.
5732967	5733667	I just didn't care.
5734408	5735648	I honestly didn't fucking care.
5735788	5737809	I hated Gears of War 1 and Gears of War 2.
5738169	5738509	Guess what?
5738589	5739270	I'm not buying it.
5739790	5741951	And to be honest, there's enough news out there.
5741991	5745652	Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of Gears of War 2?
5746373	5748233	No, I don't need to because guess what?
5748313	5750754	We didn't talk about every single demo that they had there.
5751275	5752095	I mean, seriously.
5752395	5754476	Gears of War 2 wasn't really at E3, it was just at the keynote.
5773144	5776645	Gears of War 2 will be playable at PAX Half of Microsoft's booth will be Gears 2
5796496	5796876	Gears of War 2
5822347	5823187	Next email.
5824388	5826349	Good Sunday evening to you, OLR.
5826409	5828650	I trust that everyone's been having a nice week so far.
5829190	5834993	Anyways, I'd like to say I'm kind of slow in catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my iPod anymore.
5835594	5841536	I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go, and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for OLR.
5842077	5846939	Since the newer episodes are 70 megabytes now, I'm struggling to make ends meet on my iPod.
5847299	5848380	Very nice format, though.
5848940	5857684	When I heard the news about Final Fantasy XIII being a 360 release as well, I tried thinking of PS3 exclusives.
5858105	5867209	While the first-party fare has been from decent Motorstorm to the best games I've ever played, Metal Gear Solid 4, I've yet to see many good third-party games.
5867389	5868270	Haze doesn't count.
5869110	5878015	What I'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the PS3 by releasing original, innovative games, not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for DLC ports.
5879215	5882417	Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off?
5882858	5885359	Or is it the fact that more people own 360s?
5885899	5889702	But I first can't wait for the Naruto PS3 game coming out in October though.
5890442	5896246	One last thing, with the addition of Butterfly and WW and DDRX, I think that Konami has gone too far in reminiscing.
5897847	5904491	I mean, sure, those are a couple of the best songs DDR has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated.
5906484	5908325	The additions are like a slutty girlfriend.
5908846	5910988	She may be nice and all, but who hasn't done her?
5911688	5912269	That's funny.
5912949	5917433	I mean, any DDR player has played Butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right?
5917873	5919755	Why add it in a console version now?
5920395	5926360	Well, that's all I have to say for the past few weeks, and E3, while disappointing for some, did have some very high points.
5926440	5928082	Until next time, Katamari's forever.
5928402	5931785	This message brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending American IP addresses.
5933561	5936223	Well, I'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy.
5936623	5941187	You know, obviously, there's always going to be people who love the idea and some people who don't like the idea.
5941828	5945310	I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your iPod to make it work.
5945671	5946772	I hope, one way or another.
5947392	5949013	So, that's all I have to say.
5949133	5951395	The rest of it, you know, good thoughts.
5953757	5954278	That's it.
5954778	5954958	Okay.
5957060	5957720	Greetings, everyone.
5957860	5960523	I'm here live from the laundromat showing some heart.
5960783	5962044	Are you at the laundromat right now?
5962665	5965206	No, yeah, well, no, look at the time.
5966586	5968706	Before I begin, there's a few things I'd like to say.
5969126	5974928	To DarkSakura, I've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit.
5975608	5977028	I truly loved and enjoyed everything.
5977068	5979509	Words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality.
5979869	5983230	When you come to NYC, I will give that back to you a thousandfold.
5983270	5984230	Oh, that's so sweet.
5984330	5984690	Thank you.
5985310	5987994	To Rob, I wish we had more time to hang out, not enough.
5988494	5994382	Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago, and FYI, part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show.
5994943	6001352	As I said before, when you come to New York City, I will give that back to you a thousandfold because you're so fabulous.
6002193	6003494	To Loki, you're all right in my book.
6003534	6007115	Too bad we didn't get a chance to talk more and be more chill.
6007135	6009016	You were supposed to come join me and Jamie for lunch.
6009396	6010436	I did call you a couple times.
6012077	6014138	I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay.
6014458	6017439	When you come out here to New York City, I will show you a damn good time.
6018019	6019260	Now on to some other things.
6021421	6022902	Oh wow, this is a long email, sorry.
6023742	6029946	I have said in the past that it would not surprise me that Square Enix would put Final Fantasy XII on Xbox 360.
6029986	6032388	Thank you, Square Enix, for saving my roommate $400 on a paperweight.
6037771	6058369	I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason I feel that Konami will put Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360 I'm not saying that because I'm a drooling fanboy but from a financial point of view the money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the PS3 due to the fact that it has a lower consumer home base and then the 360 that was the point actually I agree with
6058989	6064813	Putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles.
6065234	6069116	And speaking of Konami, people are calling for others to not support Konami as a sad reality.
6069557	6071518	I understand where you're coming from about this, though.
6071538	6074460	The whole lawsuit with Konami vs. Viacom is not Konami's fault.
6074760	6079664	You have to blame Activision about this because they're the ones paying licensee fees to them for Guitar Hero.
6080224	6086969	Everyone is saying that Konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides Bemani.
6087449	6091457	Konami has other titles such as Will Castlevania, Contra Metal Gear Solid, to name a few.
6091878	6096367	Also, Konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list.
6098004	6101927	I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it.
6101967	6111834	I like the gameplay screens, and what annoys me more is that the Bimani fanboys girls are going to foam at the mouth because of no Guitar Freaks Drum Mania tracks in the game.
6112315	6118799	If Konami added a lot of those tracks, they would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game.
6118839	6120080	That's my two cents on it.
6121261	6123684	Anywho, keep up the good work and don't stop believing.
6124264	6130431	This email was brought to you by Joey Pisano's on Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy, home of the 5.95 lunch specials.
6130511	6131412	You'll love Pisano's.
6132373	6136657	And also by Anime Jam Sessions, the newest anime cosplay podcast.
6136677	6137218	Cheap plug.
6137738	6137999	Yep.
6139240	6142223	Um... Yeah, uh...
6144711	6146272	I like what Black Wolf is saying in chat right now.
6146292	6146752	I'm just reading.
6147052	6149833	Does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see?
6149853	6151114	Because that's one of the symbols.
6152014	6157656	No, I don't agree with him that if you put some Bumai tracks in there that alienate, you know.
6159110	6159770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6181010	6186272	A mainstream artist that everybody would love, I mean, because some people find them annoying, like me.
6187673	6193876	And so some of the Guitar Hero tracks, or Guitar Freaks tracks, could easily be unlockable songs in that.
6194336	6201219	But, no, that would be, you know, trying to even incorporate their old audience into it, oh, well that...
6202549	6203351	That would be awful.
6203651	6211205	I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game whereas the other people may not buy your game.
6211325	6215713	So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already to buy that game.
6217350	6221572	On the other topic, I agree with his reasoning for the Final Fantasy XIII on the Xbox 360.
6221632	6227975	It just makes sense that they want to make sure they get all the development costs back by making sure they get a good share of the U.S.
6228736	6229236	marketplace.
6230376	6236799	Although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a PlayStation 3 just to get it for Final Fantasy XIII, myself being one of them.
6237220	6239761	But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it.
6240641	6241362	So, there you have it.
6243323	6244363	Any more emails tonight?
6244983	6245084	One.
6245484	6245784	One more.
6247202	6247942	Hey, LLR!
6248842	6249082	Hi.
6249683	6255744	I've been thinking about starting to play World of Warcraft, but the $15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget.
6256364	6260045	I would like everyone's opinion on whether or not it is worth the fee.
6260145	6264246	Is Guild Wars or another MMORPG without a fee a viable alternative?
6264586	6267767	I heard that there are free private servers for World of Warcraft as well.
6268147	6269147	Are these legitimate?
6269347	6269628	No.
6270728	6271728	Thank you for your time.
6272028	6273288	Keep on keeping on, Seth.
6274389	6274469	Um...
6275949	6300605	I honestly World of Warcraft I got very burned on it very quickly I suggest if you can find like a trial try out a trial of it you know see how you like it but Guild Wars I think will be better for your money if you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free Ragnarok online server
6301936	6305378	I agree, though, that Guild Wars is a viable alternative to World of Warcraft.
6305418	6305918	I mean, it's different.
6305958	6308259	You can't say they're the same game, because they're not.
6308939	6314281	At a glance, they look the same, and even when you're first playing them, you're like, oh, there's a lot of similarities.
6314301	6316903	But kind of the way the endgame works is much different.
6317263	6322885	I mean, Guild Wars is really about guilds warring in the final endstages.
6322905	6324726	There's only 20 levels in the game, after all.
6325086	6326306	And you can download the client online.
6355397	6360204	Very, very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game.
6361826	6366854	I actually sort of had the thought of giving it one more go myself.
6367611	6375799	I mean, I got really annoyed with it, but I figured if I... And this is what I always do, is that I play for a couple months and quit again.
6376700	6381045	So, I guess with being in school, I'm not going to really have a whole lot of time to play.
6381145	6383948	But I was thinking of maybe giving it another go.
6384388	6385850	It got really boring.
6385990	6387171	Blood elves are hot.
6387411	6388092	They are.
6388733	6389934	But it got really boring.
6390768	6392869	Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time.
6392910	6393390	Yeah, it was.
6393710	6394391	Oh, I couldn't remember.
6394851	6395972	I had just upgraded.
6396812	6397192	Oh, wow, okay.
6397213	6399354	Because remember... That's right.
6399594	6399974	I remember.
6400215	6400515	I remember.
6400575	6400835	Yeah.
6402116	6402416	All right.
6402976	6403977	So that's it for the email then.
6404117	6404357	All right.
6404397	6408480	If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com is the place to send those emails.
6409141	6412123	For now, Loki's going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic.
6412622	6415543	Yes, how ironic, all of this.
6416564	6426328	Gears of War 2, there's some new things been announced about it, including that they're going to have some content for Gears of War 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from Gears of War 1.
6427408	6432071	And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had.
6432431	6433071	So that's kind of neat.
6433761	6449944	and also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for Halo 3 which will be the $130 Lancer bundle that will come with a Lancer yes a miniature replica model of a Lancer what game is this again?
6451004	6462206	Gears of War 2 I'm getting Gears of War 2 it's not the same kind of Lancer that you're thinking of it's a chainsaw gun I still want one
6464181	6464561	All right.
6465041	6466002	I like everything Lancer.
6467042	6468403	What about the whole achievements thing?
6469824	6470704	The whole achievements thing?
6470724	6470984	Yeah.
6471184	6471805	Yeah, I mentioned that.
6471965	6472425	Oh, sorry.
6472945	6473745	I spaced for a minute.
6474646	6474926	I don't know.
6474946	6475666	What do you think of it, though?
6475706	6476507	It's an achievement horror.
6476527	6477307	I think that's kind of cool.
6477767	6479688	I think it's something they should implement in other games.
6479768	6483730	It will get you to buy some of their older games, like Gears of War.
6484110	6485871	Especially for the achievement horror in all of this.
6486031	6486391	Exactly.
6486431	6487632	You make the announcement now.
6488072	6490053	They just released that Gears of War refresh.
6490473	6492154	Time to buy your copy of that for like $39.99.
6493054	6496915	And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff.
6497275	6500236	They used to do that kind of with Burnout, actually.
6500256	6503898	Remember Burnout 3 and stuff like that?
6504758	6505998	Burnout Revenge actually did this.
6506959	6511100	If you had a game save for Burnout 3, you got a car from Burnout 3.
6511480	6516302	And then also if you had a Madden save, you got the Madden van.
6517162	6519085	in Burnout.
6519145	6522509	I don't understand why they don't do this more often, but whatever.
6523430	6523731	Alright.
6526183	6527203	Cool, I like the idea.
6528184	6530465	But I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements.
6530906	6535989	But one game I am definitely considering buying is Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe because I actually like Mortal Kombat quite a bit.
6536449	6542674	And even though I'm not as huge into comic books as some other people, I think the DC Universe characters are pretty good.
6542954	6551139	And you know, tons of people have Joker fever right now because of the new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on.
6551639	6552200	Lots of people...
6552560	6553861	Jax and Katana Green Lantern Green Lantern
6581577	6583118	That could be pretty cool.
6583298	6583979	So there you have it.
6584779	6594908	Now the question is, since villains supposedly could have fatalities, even though heroes count because of the whole DC Comics rules, could the Joker kill people in the game?
6595429	6595769	I don't know.
6597991	6601614	I think even if they're fatalities, they're going to be really kind of softened down.
6601634	6602735	You're not going to see any head ripping.
6603363	6607626	Honestly, if it's the Joker, you don't know what he's going to do.
6608487	6613090	I think that if they give him fatalities, they either should or shouldn't go off at random.
6613810	6618413	Like if he pulled out a gun, it'd either blow their head off or punch him with a big fist or something.
6618733	6619154	Nice idea.
6619234	6619574	I like that.
6619614	6620594	Or say bang.
6621055	6621915	Because this is the Joker.
6622436	6624097	You don't know what he's going to do.
6624257	6625718	He does this to freak you out.
6626636	6627296	That's a good idea.
6627917	6629097	That would be very Joker.
6629417	6633419	And then, you know, you get like bang, bang, bang, you know, three things in a row.
6633759	6636661	And right when you think, oh, it's not going to happen, boom, headshot.
6638522	6643504	GameGuru hypothesizes that Joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room.
6644644	6648166	Zene in chat says Jax was booed when he first came up at the panel.
6648546	6649047	That's sad.
6649107	6649687	Jax is cool.
6649727	6653549	He has metal arms because he's got his own fatality done on him somehow.
6654089	6654209	Hmm.
6658103	6661726	I would like to say that I have some interesting news.
6662166	6662586	Oh, really?
6663587	6664067	Yes, really.
6664247	6665468	And this makes me quite happy.
6666729	6676314	Although, I'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned, well, that we don't have in show role, but ties into this, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago.
6678276	6683619	There is actually a rumor stating, and this actually was going on at a
6684499	6698308	San Diego Comic Con 08 Marvel Studios President of Production was saying well they were actually asked if there would be another Marvel vs. Capcom and he said yes and maybe sooner than you think
6699669	6714455	So, but the other thing I've been reading is that when, and you know I've covered this on the show before, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which by the way, there's more stuff out, more characters in it, including Hurricane Polymer, Kashan, Gatchaman.
6716236	6740755	uh the robot one I can never remember the name of um Techaman for for anyone who's like and also Batsu's in it from rival schools um uh Morrigan um just a bunch of you know characters but going back to the the Marvel uh versus Capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um the current test machines being out in Japan for Tatsunoko versus Capcom that Marvel was sort of like uh we want to make money off of this again
6741075	6742816	AJ Mix wants to see some Power Stone characters.
6757222	6760624	Actually, from what I understand, they have it for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
6760945	6763046	And actually, if you give me a second, I'll get the character list for you real quick.
6763807	6768431	The actual full trailer for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is actually up on YouTube right now.
6768471	6771493	You can find it easy just looking up Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.
6771513	6772374	But give me just a quick sec.
6773146	6774347	DC Comics, Marvel, DC Comics, DC Comics, DC Comics
6798962	6801685	Okay, so far I don't have the full list of everything.
6802506	6806831	Okay, here's what we have so far for the list of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom characters.
6807331	6819965	We have Owashi no Ken, who is a G1 for Gatchaman, Kashan from the Kashan anime, Techaman from Techaman the Space Knight, Yachaman number one from Yachaman, Hurricane Polymer,
6820525	6823107	and GoldLighton from Golden Warrior, GoldLighton.
6823328	6834077	And from Capcom, there's Ryu, Chun-Li, Batsu from Rival Schools, Alex from Street Fighter 3, Morgan from Darkstalkers, and Silky from Onimusha, Dawn of Dreams.
6834938	6838961	So it's actually on location test in Tokyo right now.
6840502	6848764	and hopefully, I've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more as far as an actual release date soon.
6848864	6852025	In fact, I'm pulling up another list here.
6852245	6856367	They're saying a December 2008 actual release window.
6856947	6858227	So that's fairly cool.
6858267	6860628	I hope they add more characters though.
6861428	6861928	I really do.
6862068	6866089	But the poster though seems to be pretty finalized, the one that they've got out now.
6867870	6868250	Alright.
6869835	6871696	I want Speed Racer as a hidden character.
6872756	6874797	That was a Tatsunoko production thing.
6875678	6879380	Lord Katsuhiro in chat says, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom could come to the US.
6879740	6882922	It just depends on who holds what license to which Tatsunoko anime.
6884063	6885484	Still is going to be a pain in the ass, though.
6885584	6886244	Either way.
6888265	6888665	You know what?
6890146	6891167	I'm going to import it no matter what.
6892107	6892408	Got to.
6893868	6895609	You love Gatchaman and all those other characters.
6896730	6898051	That news does not surprise me one bit.
6900299	6925116	Alright, well if you have been following Core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the PlayStation Network, you'll probably have figured out that if you have purchased the, I want to say the August version of Core, whatever one just came out, you'll actually be able to get into the Resistance 2 beta this September.
6925997	6926137	And
6927794	6955723	also there will be some other ways to get in besides that according to MyResistance.net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game and they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon but if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new Naruto game but you get into the Resistance beta huh
6956905	6960607	I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing that's been very popular lately.
6961167	6967869	You know, whatever happened to the good old fashions, you know, sign up for it or, you know, it doesn't go out to the public at all.
6967929	6969590	It's just friends and family, even that.
6969890	6970530	What are you talking about?
6970550	6972251	Pay for demos have been around for a long time.
6972271	6975692	Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation magazine to get your demo disc?
6975872	6976753	Doesn't mean I like it.
6978794	6979974	Doesn't mean I like it one bit.
6982566	6985109	Will you sign up for a core membership?
6985129	6990074	No, because it's the 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer.
6990174	6993578	I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested.
6994760	6995481	Well, then there you go.
6996402	6999626	Alright, well, I think we need to give out an award for stupidity.
7004929	7009090	Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that.
7009130	7010431	It's much easier this week.
7011051	7015532	It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC.
7015592	7018553	Congratulations, you're the winner of the Stupid Award this week.
7018993	7019694	Here's why.
7019754	7026816	It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle.
7029023	7037828	I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle as long as they use figures or sales or even history, for God's sake.
7037988	7038548	I don't care.
7038949	7044111	But here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war.
7044892	7046973	It's because her son said so.
7047393	7048854	Her 16-year-old son said so.
7049594	7054816	He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened.
7055176	7058097	He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed.
7058157	7069241	After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4, as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline, and the awesomeness of Blu-ray, he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in.
7071061	7073982	As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you with a PlayStation.
7074422	7075763	Neither did I, he replied.
7076857	7083984	Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that, that he kept on top of all the...
7086243	7093806	I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out.
7094826	7099868	I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion.
7100228	7106090	I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact.
7107411	7113373	I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war.
7114213	7114533	I don't know.
7115151	7115972	Either way, it's retarded.
7116952	7120075	And this, yeah, shouldn't be reported on CNBC.
7120675	7123857	It's Financial Investor Network.
7123897	7125098	That's the problem I have with it.
7125899	7130982	And the whole thing sounds like a big old I-wanted-PSP-for-Christmas thing.
7133364	7138568	Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next.
7155545	7158269	I would like to say F you to whatever
7160809	7165911	Well, whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition, my grandmom is in the hospital right now.
7167172	7170033	It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that.
7170153	7173635	I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her.
7174395	7187341	And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, and other people... And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on, so...
7188101	7188221	Logi!
7210611	7215034	Um, I feed the people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people.
7215474	7218316	Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use?
7218716	7219376	And I'm like, no.
7220637	7222198	I don't own a cell phone at all.
7223956	7224556	Get the fuck off.
7225797	7226077	That's it.
7246499	7247660	F you to that
7271741	7275825	Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news.
7276026	7277387	DarkSakura, what you got for us?
7277447	7277887	Come next.
7278648	7280370	Oh, just some stuff.
7281431	7282252	Cool, I like stuff.
7284394	7289900	Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked?
7290320	7290601	Mm-hmm.
7291514	7313087	Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock Remixes are actually going to be, and this is just going to give me a second because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze, but some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.
7314795	7316356	At least as far as I can see on here.
7317457	7318858	So I think that's pretty cool.
7318938	7324942	They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on the remixes.
7325283	7325923	DJ Pretzel.
7326684	7328405	We've actually had a few of the stuff on here.
7329185	7331907	Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley.
7331947	7337191	I guess I don't see a nickname for him.
7337211	7338152	But I think that's pretty cool.
7338412	7341254	They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the...
7342837	7344458	I agree, that is pretty cool.
7344879	7345719	Kudos to Capcom.
7345919	7347280	You're doing a lot of stuff right this year.
7348161	7348621	Good for you.
7349121	7350082	They figured it out.
7352063	7355786	Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon.
7356647	7367154	You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month.
7368499	7368779	Oh, well.
7368920	7371022	Well, now, what if it's Nintendo holding on to it?
7371182	7372564	What if it's Nintendo's fault?
7372704	7374426	Oh, wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault.
7374686	7375747	That's just lies.
7375767	7376328	That's what I thought.
7378021	7386966	But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.
7387787	7394871	And players, of course, will be able to control both animated characters, and hilarity will ensue from there.
7395571	7405177	No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series.
7405237	7406278	So that's kind of neat.
7407372	7409153	Episodic Gaming's The Wave of the Future
7434552	7440036	Maybe you're a Scrabulous player, but the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally.
7440416	7446440	Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game.
7447020	7455545	Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January.
7455946	7459168	So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on Scrabulous.
7459628	7460429	Facebook, Pogo, iPod, iPhone
7478766	7479386	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7498854	7499134	DarkSakura
7517390	7519972	The Skype line is now open for business.
7544175	7544996	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7545016	7545376	Who's this?
7546337	7547679	Hey, it's Lord Katsuhito.
7548519	7549240	Is it now?
7549600	7551082	Wait, you changed your name tonight?
7551943	7554005	Are you referring to that in the Geni sense?
7555586	7556067	Maybe.
7557228	7560071	Do not start singing the Bo-Grom song.
7560091	7562293	So, Ranma, you already had an email read tonight.
7562313	7563534	This phone call better be good.
7563574	7563955	What's up?
7564795	7566916	I want to talk about Fat Princess.
7567316	7569536	I want to discuss this game.
7569576	7570237	Please do.
7570637	7573498	That alone makes me want to drop the $400 for a PlayStation 3.
7573678	7574698	Really?
7574778	7575138	Why?
7576218	7577459	The game looks fun.
7577699	7578299	I'm sorry.
7578779	7579859	It looks fun.
7580040	7587222	I've spent money on frivolous things, but that would be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game.
7587502	7590723	And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up.
7590843	7591583	I mean, really.
7593581	7601623	Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure.
7601663	7605384	Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360.
7605424	7607404	Not the sole reason, but a big reason.
7607424	7609485	I would say Xbox Live in general was.
7610725	7617087	It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way.
7617147	7617727	Sure, go for it.
7618442	7622683	I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times.
7622724	7623284	Why not?
7623304	7623464	Why not?
7648635	7649256	Everyone, get over it!
7672276	7673817	I'm never going to stop playing games.
7674318	7677541	But it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like twos.
7678281	7679682	And I'll still play Fat Princess.
7681944	7683145	Alright, any other thoughts, Ranma?
7684827	7685667	Don't stop believing.
7686128	7687789	Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend.
7688089	7693754	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be.
7695416	7695616	Um...
7697662	7698142	Let's see.
7698862	7699623	Comments in chat.
7699643	7703364	GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games like Talim from Soul Calibur.
7705385	7707325	Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke.
7707405	7707806	Let it be.
7709806	7719530	You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it.
7719610	7720590	This offends me.
7720710	7721470	And then, bitch.
7721690	7722191	I don't like it.
7722231	7722911	This offends me.
7724247	7731251	Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easygoing and go with the goddamn flow?
7732492	7740276	I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things.
7740536	7742397	Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work.
7742718	7743458	That's a good thing.
7743518	7747560	You know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like.
7748221	7749882	You don't have to have a hissy.
7751808	7753669	Just say, I don't like this.
7754170	7755030	And then get over it.
7756171	7759133	You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something.
7759173	7759553	I don't know.
7761234	7762094	Some comments in chat.
7762214	7766897	SSJ100Matt says, Maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles.
7767077	7768178	Why do you think she wears that dress?
7768878	7770519	Shaoran, it's a slimming dress.
7771080	7774682	Shaoran says, We need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.
7776363	7777423	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
7777443	7777864	Who's this?
7778944	7779945	Nah, it's Legend of Zalkin.
7780296	7781776	Hey Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
7783057	7786458	Nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all.
7787158	7788258	Yesterday's what party?
7789219	7794520	Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, massive rock band, lots of booze.
7794860	7797401	I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party?
7797461	7799502	Because you don't have a party without rock band.
7799562	7801742	Alright, then it officially was a party.
7801982	7805543	Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band.
7805983	7807304	And I left after an hour and a half.
7807944	7811646	But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia.
7812027	7813888	And that got me to stay as long as I did.
7814408	7815969	Because lumpia, good stuff.
7816389	7817270	Anyway, sorry, Zaku.
7817570	7818951	I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food.
7819692	7821653	What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight?
7822553	7823714	Well, let me see.
7823734	7825595	I'm trying to think right now.
7826116	7837403	The fact of the matter that Street Fighter 4 and the state of the arcades in this country, the fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machines.
7839468	7849171	But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore.
7849851	7855353	Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami and, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too.
7855453	7857254	I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven?
7857274	7859414	And DDR, of course, are they a little more forgiven?
7859434	7860114	Well, that's DDR.
7860355	7861235	That's an exception.
7862715	7867937	You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades and then all of a sudden, you know,
7869082	7870122	especially in America.
7871863	7876785	You know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved.
7877405	7882767	I would say, true statement, because Street Fighter 2, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades.
7882827	7885328	It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo.
7885608	7888289	It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge.
7888890	7889730	15 years ago, even.
7890870	7897633	And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, making efforts to, like, help
7899719	7906877	Instead of just beating around the bush and saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only.
7907971	7913313	How come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades?
7913353	7918874	I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades.
7919495	7919995	I wonder why not.
7920035	7921255	Well, think about it.
7921275	7921855	It's a risk.
7922256	7929998	You see the current state of the economy right now and how gas is ridiculously expensive.
7930058	7932399	People are trying to save as much money as possible.
7932979	7933179	So...
7934253	7938695	The first thing to go in tough times like these is entertainment.
7939556	7940897	I guess I can see that.
7942437	7949901	And the fact that the consoles have pretty much given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out.
7950481	7952983	Because they're outdoing the graphics.
7955044	7955764	I guess I can see that.
7957365	7957985	Well, I don't know.
7958005	7959306	What do you think the answer is?
7959386	7961847	When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever?
7961907	7962568	What's it going to take?
7963351	7968673	It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
7969633	7971114	That's a good saying.
7971134	7978177	It's effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games, Capcom, Konami, you know, the others.
7979097	7987840	They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades.
7988440	7990201	The ones that are struggling just to get by.
7990221	7992542	At least help them out a little bit.
7993126	7995668	Alright, Zaku, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
7997470	8016626	Um, let me see, yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it, it's done, it's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference.
8018904	8022085	I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it here in studio.
8023025	8024185	I know, it's like old news.
8024225	8024986	I'm thinking of that.
8025006	8026046	I should have brought it yesterday.
8026066	8026546	It's alright.
8027186	8028446	Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse.
8028526	8028946	It's alright.
8029306	8030407	Just to remind it it's dead.
8030787	8032127	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.
8032307	8032927	Have a good one, buddy.
8033947	8034307	Bye.
8034508	8038728	Later.
8039309	8041089	It's New York night on the Skype line.
8041109	8042509	That was two New Yorkers in a row.
8042809	8043009	Yep.
8043209	8044250	I haven't been to New York in a while.
8044290	8045030	It's been at least a year.
8045130	8045930	It's time for me to go back.
8046784	8048406	It's been about 12 years for me.
8048466	8048986	You need to go.
8049226	8051208	We need to storm the big city.
8051829	8052249	Be fun.
8052409	8053630	Literally storm through it.
8053931	8056213	As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it.
8056833	8059676	We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there.
8059696	8060016	We'll see.
8060116	8060417	Someday.
8061157	8065762	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
8066122	8069225	We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon.
8069865	8070846	But first, some more calls.
8070926	8071887	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8071907	8072268	Who's this?
8073587	8076868	It's GS68, and I just broke the streak of New York gamers.
8076988	8078089	You're not from New York.
8078189	8078729	No, what's up?
8080510	8084271	Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it.
8084731	8093555	One way to do that would be to lower game prices, because these days, what typical gamer would pay more than $0.25 or $0.50 to play an arcade game?
8094855	8101778	Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much, but isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive?
8102489	8111816	I suppose, I mean, as much in... I hate to bring up Initial D again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs.
8111916	8116279	I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know?
8116439	8121223	But then everybody would know it's a budget cab, and people would go, this one's lame, it's not as good as the other one.
8121543	8122824	You know what an awesome cab was?
8122844	8124065	It was F-Zero AX.
8124085	8125426	That was a brilliant cabinet.
8125746	8126667	That was so fun.
8127107	8128768	Yeah, but look at Time Crisis 4.
8128808	8130510	The majority of the cab...
8132651	8139034	I don't know.
8139314	8153280	Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom?
8154361	8154581	And then
8156189	8156569	What else?
8156629	8163672	I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games, like in the 70s and 80s.
8164232	8165893	Nowadays, it's the other way around.
8165913	8173096	I mean, can you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that?
8174897	8178318	You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face.
8178498	8181239	A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else.
8181619	8182160	That would be something.
8182540	8185141	Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down.
8186377	8186737	I suppose.
8186757	8189898	Alright, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go?
8189938	8190118	Um, no.
8214438	8217719	I have news here about a guy who marathoned like 26 hours and a half playing the drums on Rock Band.
8243683	8247544	He played rock band drums for 26 and a half hours.
8247804	8248764	Did his arm fall off?
8250205	8251265	Unfortunately, not.
8252345	8252685	Wow.
8252705	8253826	Was he playing on hard mode?
8255066	8255966	He was playing an expert.
8256346	8260148	He's actually from the Star Hero Farms.
8260188	8261348	He's a staff member there.
8262768	8263048	Huh.
8263949	8264829	What was the point?
8264869	8265849	Was it charity or what?
8267530	8268890	Just have fun, basically.
8269989	8271810	He did something for charity though.
8272991	8280315	It wasn't that, how do you say it, big, because he only got to like $200.
8282165	8283385	Well, still, charity's charity.
8310250	8310990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8327276	8333960	Go to Jamie's and in her big game archive, we'll pick games and every hour the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next.
8334240	8335621	But they're like obscure shit.
8335861	8337382	Like no Mario, no Zelda.
8337402	8339363	What the hell do you think I have in the vault?
8339403	8343686	We're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault is what we would play all marathon long.
8343706	8344726	Do you think people would be into that?
8345907	8346948	Yeah, that would be cool.
8347488	8350950	I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out.
8351210	8353892	I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you.
8354468	8355450	Yes, that too.
8355870	8358775	But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off.
8359296	8360017	We'll have to think about it.
8360318	8363583	Maybe for, I would say, if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend.
8363603	8365146	Maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something.
8365206	8365526	I don't know.
8365807	8366769	Just throwing ideas out there.
8366789	8368011	Some three-day weekend we'll have to see.
8369468	8396347	Though basically the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the chat on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh, cool, like sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh, man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band.
8397047	8399129	And it makes me kind of pissed because...
8399798	8405584	Even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure.
8406705	8410909	Playing Expert, all the songs, even the Download Continent, so...
8411841	8420544	It's like... I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and those types of... Whatever website ran stories on this and whatever.
8420884	8424445	My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror.
8424765	8432048	You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills.
8432468	8438870	No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band.
8439310	8442672	If you think you're any better than the guy playing Rock Band, guess what?
8442792	8443812	You're worse.
8445933	8446394	The end.
8446574	8447014	Indeed.
8447514	8448135	I agree with that.
8448175	8450336	There is no counter-argument to that.
8450836	8454198	You are worse than the guy playing Rock Band, which, you know what?
8454338	8457939	If it makes him happy, I think he... Play it for 48 hours next time.
8457959	8458320	I support it.
8462577	8471707	He did say that he may try in December to do that again with all the download content that is going to be released until then.
8473249	8474130	So that would be cool.
8474650	8475151	Very cool.
8475912	8479796	Alright, Actdeft, thank you so much for the call and party on with Rock Band.
8481598	8482118	Yeah, thanks.
8482339	8483079	Have a good one, buddy.
8485660	8490447	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories.
8490967	8492409	DarkSakura, by chance, anything?
8493190	8500800	I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors and apparently there's even video now apparently
8502102	8503243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8530259	8530999	Loki, anything for you?
8532820	8534841	I don't think I have really much of anything.
8535141	8540283	There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground that kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious.
8541103	8543504	Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake.
8544684	8545864	So that's kind of interesting.
8546685	8551546	Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2.
8551607	8554087	Talk about stunt casting.
8554668	8557989	Really, I just think they want someone with big tits on their cover, so...
8558889	8559970	I support that fully.
8562312	8565795	Let's see here.
8566175	8566716	Don't care.
8567797	8580487	Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st, and what's kind of cool about it is it'll have the character creator with it, and you can actually share those characters that you create online, and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September.
8581088	8584511	So that's kind of neat.
8585952	8586653	Let's see...
8589461	8594467	BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader, I'll just pay $60.
8594527	8595107	K, thanks.
8595147	8598691	Well, I'll pay $60, and then maybe the $10, and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with.
8614315	8614915	Just messing.
8617316	8629240	Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun.
8629940	8632501	But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio.
8633282	8638743	I will start tonight and my final thought is I want a snack.
8638863	8640024	I want snacky foods.
8640524	8640864	Yum.
8640944	8641344	Yogurt.
8641384	8642285	I want frozen yogurt.
8642305	8642925	That would be really good.
8642945	8643585	Oh my god, Rob.
8643806	8644686	That'd sound really good.
8644746	8645926	That's my final thought, too.
8646647	8647507	I want frozen yogurt.
8647567	8648127	Let's go get some.
8648288	8648688	We can't.
8648708	8649268	They all close at 9.
8649548	8650529	We'll screw them.
8650569	8651489	Let's go to the grocery store.
8653690	8655111	I do need to go to the grocery store, though.
8655151	8655971	Loki, your final thought.
8658252	8658592	I don't know.
8658612	8659252	I don't have anything.
8659833	8660173	All right.
8660353	8660573	Wow.
8660633	8662354	All our PSPs still being worked on.
8662654	8664835	I just have a lot of small things I have to finish.
8665935	8667536	But it is been working.
8667556	8669017	I've been working on it quite heavily, so.
8670158	8670403	Soon.
