19000	22000	is an official HaloCon in the near future,
22000	25000	and a PC gaming service has gone free!
25000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet,
33000	35000	and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35000	38000	We are that podcast on the internet, dedicated to video games,
38000	41000	video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41000	43000	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always,
43000	47000	say hello to the one and only, the lovely, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
47000	50000	Tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron.
50000	53000	So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic Con.
53000	55000	Happy, happy, happy.
55000	56000	So what is this, they're making a new Tron?
56000	57000	Yes.
57000	59000	Just Tron 2, is all you need to be saying.
59000	60000	And Jeff Bridges is in it.
60000	61000	Yeah, I saw that in the trailer.
61000	62000	And he looks evil.
62000	63000	What was up with that trailer though,
63000	66000	like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away.
66000	70000	Yeah, but someone else went back in and tried to zoom in
70000	73000	and clean it up and get it looking as good as possible,
73000	75000	so you can actually see some more stuff in it.
75000	77000	Are they that strict with cameras at Comic Con?
77000	79000	I mean, I would think with millions of people.
79000	81000	That's Disney's panel.
81000	82000	Yeah.
82000	86040	I would think that Disney would want to keep it
86260	90840	Well you okay remember any at one of the last t3s that we went to when Kingdom Hearts 2 came out
91000	96700	Mm-hmm Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed when a vista vista would hmm remember yeah, yeah
96700	99940	Yeah, I remember that so I would use that as sort of a past precedent
100660	104240	Yeah, but still what are they gonna do? There's like thousands of people at Comic Con
104240	109400	You know what I mean especially in those panels as far as I can tell though this this cell phone video was the only thing
109400	110720	That I've seen
110720	115000	So interesting well whatever they're doing it works, but I've never been to Comic Con
115000	120000	Maybe next year. I'm going next year the one and only me Glatov. You've probably heard on this show
120000	122560	He was a comic-con. He was giving me calls pretty much every day
122560	125060	He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face
126000	128000	He's a jerk intensely
128360	130920	Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while yeah kind of
131680	135220	All right speaking of jerks say hello to tech master Loki
135800	137160	Just kidding
137160	142640	Hey, I'm doing fine. Were you just watching a little preview because I was reading up on it
142640	147040	But you know I didn't know that they actually had filmed it of course you have to assume that
147400	151760	Anything that says do not film someone's gonna film it so exactly exactly especially something is
152280	155320	Widely anticipated is that yeah, so hey just think about it
155320	160440	It'll make a great video game except then again. There was a Tron 2.0 stop anybody do very well
160440	162640	I think there's they should go ahead and try again
163680	165680	There's a better the freeware
165680	167600	or share where a
167600	172760	Light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while. It's really really good cool
172760	177800	I remember surround on the Atari 2600 that was just light cycles well remember that
178400	180640	Anyhow if you want to join us in our chat room
180640	186840	We are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number
187720	189720	289 of our podcast damn world
190080	193320	chat that orange launch radio comm is the place to be if you want to
193320	199560	join in with the chat, and I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now and
200120	203300	Some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy
203640	209200	And all that stuff and some people are commenting about how during the previous show the Bobby Black Wolf show on all games radio
209360	213760	Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was a Bobby Black Wolf show
214440	218080	Some people in there commenting on that if you want to hear that you got to listen to Bobby show though
218080	220080	He's available at all games calm
220120	222120	Click on Bobby Black Wolf show
222120	225160	Alright, let's get into um. How was your gaming week?
225160	230980	We always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, so how was your gaming week Dark Sakura after the response who?
231500	236400	Ronchon real quick sure he said he handed me he who shall not be named us still beating heart
236440	238440	But that means you'd have to have a heart first
239760	243740	Instead of a lump of coal nice like some like the evil Smurfette did
245400	247160	All right so gaming week
247160	252880	I played stuff actually I did finally start Aurora faint, and that gives freaking cool. I
254240	260320	Don't know much about this game. Tell us a little bit about Aurora. It's an iPhone game. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, okay? That is
261080	266440	It's it's sort of like how will be to help be jeweled does except you can only move them horizontally
266520	270200	But you can sort of slide as as you destroy groups
270200	275240	They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does when you you know but you can actually move blocks off to the side
275240	279080	And and move them that way move them laterally into empty spaces
279160	284520	So it's sort of a neat a neat thing and you can level up and learn new techniques
284520	288960	and it's a very cool little game and and very pretty and shiny and
290600	292320	I played
292320	295060	This other thing called color spiral, but all it is is just
295680	301760	Drawing really awful circles on the iPhone so it sucks, and I got a sudoku game just to try it
301760	308560	I got it's just called sudoku free and it actually it's kind of neat really you know easy as in
308960	311020	really easy as in
312080	318000	But it's it's it's pretty the interface is pretty you can choose your color. I've done something similar
318000	318960	I've had just this week
318960	324740	I downloaded coffee time crosswords because I kind of felt obligated as it is a new Xbox Live arcade title to kind of look at
324740	325920	it and
325920	330480	My obligation dried up in about three minutes. I was just like this game is poopy well to answer
330480	332480	an alpha
332500	333960	Kynanogram
333960	336240	The game was called aurora faint
336800	343720	Fe int like a battle maneuver. It sounds a little like medios with the whole sideways only movement thing
343720	345460	You'll have to give it a try. You'll have to get a try
345460	349340	You can actually make a character on my phone if you want that's cool or one of these days
349340	354960	I'll finally break down to buy an iPhone one of these days. I hear people are still lining up for that stuff. That's crazy
355560	357560	but also um I
357920	359720	I
359720	363940	Downloaded something else. I actually think that I might though try uh I
364600	368280	Was actually this was it. I was about to download miss pac-man and
369720	374520	Apparently it's utter crap, so I didn't do it because
375040	378920	The there's no real good way to control it um I can imagine
379280	382360	They should do marble madness for iPhone though if they can do monkey ball
382360	388880	They can do marble madness good time, but monkey ball sucks on iPhone. Just letting you know really yes, you have to um
388880	393160	To play just right instead of holding your phone at a perfect um
394360	400000	Flat angle you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position
400680	402360	so it's
402360	404360	really
404600	406160	Not
406160	407640	good
407640	414400	Um I also I did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been because I've been doing a lot of homework
414400	420280	I did though get some some fantastic nerd time yesterday
420640	425720	Wasn't video game related, but but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it and it pissed me off
426440	427120	What's that?
427120	431800	I watched a whole crap ton of stargate sg1 that is pretty nerdy friend Becky
431800	434640	And I are finally finishing up the fourth season box set
436160	441680	And I remember how excited I was at e3 when they had the big stargate thing up
441680	446120	And I was like oh hell. Yes. Do you want and then did the game ever come out? No? No?
446640	448400	canceled
448400	449440	I
449440	452360	Was like don't let me take your picture in front of the giant stargate
452360	458360	I remember that right that was awesome as I love me some stargate except. I do not like stargate at Linda's
459200	465480	Okay, not very much. All right before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show any other games um
465480	473140	No, all right not that there's anything wrong with a game of life not that there's anything wrong with a nerdy sci-fi
473140	477120	Talk show because we have like pod culture. We know them and like them and
477760	480200	Travis Donovan under station live they kind of do something
481120	482480	Do it?
482480	486620	Hi, Travis. All right moving on. Thank you. How was your gaming week?
487320	489620	My gaming week was okay. I played
489620	496420	I played Magnetica because I haven't actually tried that yet on the DS, and it was pretty fun
496420	498940	it's sort of like Zuma a little bit, but
499540	502300	They add a few things to actually make it different
502300	504500	So that was kind of neat try to get my wife to play it
504500	507060	And she said I don't like the way it aims and it that sucks
507060	512260	So I'm not touching it then meanwhile she ends up playing it anyways and then still complains about it
512740	515220	She's been playing super collapse 3 instead
515220	520100	I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and I
520860	526380	got to say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I
527060	533180	Don't really care for the new 3d graphics. Especially when they they have all their like most of the cutscenes are in-game
533700	540980	Using the in-game engine and when you get really close to some of those characters man those textures are really low-res
541260	543580	but overall it's it's pretty good and
543580	547960	And then I played also Korg 10 DS
548760	553060	Which isn't really a game, but more of you know an actual piece of
553780	558240	Synthesizer software and so played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10
558240	562260	I didn't really make much with it, but it's fun
562260	567440	It's it'll be cool to play around with and then on a 360
568080	570080	Of course more Grantham thought of four
570080	573040	I don't really have to say much more about that and
575360	576560	Also
576560	578640	Tried out on the Wii
579600	582840	Wario Land shake which just got released in Japan and
584440	586540	It's awesome. It really is it's
587360	594580	You know a perfect example of how they can do really good 2d platform games now with the technology
594580	599040	That's out there all hand-drawn animation. They have anime cutscenes
599040	606120	It's really cool. It really is and sadly enough. If only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game
607120	611520	at e3 they might have actually saved their you know a little press conference, but
612520	614520	whatever and
614560	620480	Then let's see what else that I play. I think that's about it. Actually. This is pretty brief
621000	625760	Alright, well my gaming week. I also played Final Fantasy 4 quite a bit that pretty much dominated by gaming week
625760	627760	You know Final Fantasy 4 is probably
627760	631600	My favorite maybe either my favorite or my second favorite
631600	636100	I haven't decided but it's one of my favorites of the is fun entire Final Fantasy series
636100	641800	I definitely like it more than any of the PlayStation ones or even Final Fantasy 10 or hell even 12. I
642320	647560	Love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS
647640	654040	It's kind of interesting because the difficulty you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty if you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2
654040	658840	American like I did you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty, you know
658840	662600	you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and
662920	667520	Just you didn't really have to grind or anything like that. You do need to do a little bit not a lot
667520	670440	I mean that gets annoying in role-playing games. You'll have to do a lot of grinding
670440	673480	You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't you know
673480	675080	Getting completely overpowered by the enemies
675080	680720	You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you the speed of how they're attacking
680720	684160	You know and all of that you can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game
684160	688880	And it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience. Also, you have the new translation and everything
688880	692100	I really like that they put voice acting in the game
692100	697000	It's kind of neat even though it only shows up in a few select scenes. They actually pull it off on the DS pretty well
697460	700640	It's not a plus level voice acting but it's not terrible
700800	706240	It does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years
706400	709960	My biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki
709960	714840	I don't like the graphics. I don't like the look very much of what they've given the game
714840	717760	It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game
717760	723040	Well, it's like all the cutscene choppy and even thought it feels like even Final Fantasy 7 looked better than this
723040	728880	The cutscenes don't have the same like style of graphics as you know, the actual game itself, you know
728880	733880	The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just like
733880	740080	Cartoony, it's not like Final Fantasy 7 where you know, the graphics were kind of cartoony
740080	744400	But the cutscenes the characters were also a bit cartoony as well
745000	751420	It's just it doesn't match whatsoever. You go with this really like super deformed looking character to like ultra realistic
751420	753280	It's just not I don't know what it is
753280	758380	But I would have almost just preferred redone sprites like I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games
758480	762660	Those games are beautiful and they're still sprite based but they look amazing
762660	765800	You know, I really like the look on those and that's kind of what I've almost wish
766400	771360	This had been and I I see Game Guru and Chad is saying just get Final Fantasy 4 advanced
771360	779240	I mean, yeah, but that was just basically a port with you know, the new translation and and possibly that ramped up difficulty
779240	779440	I mean
779440	783280	I do like some of the other frills in the DS game such as I kind of think that whole
783560	788520	Wit the the extra summon there Rydia has the wit that you can actually customize
788520	793680	I don't know how far you got but once you pick up Rydia and you can't you actually get to Kaipo the desert town
793680	797260	You kind of can play your first, you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons
797260	800600	That will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands
800600	804260	You actually level it up through these silly little DS games like the math game
804260	808720	Which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game. Maybe it's just the nerd in me
808720	813160	I don't know, but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game
813160	819520	I like the whole map thing that they use the bottom screen is basically a map of a dungeon and when you get a hundred
819520	822540	Percent completion on a map like if you've explored the whole map
823000	824800	You get like a little bonus
824800	830400	Like maybe an extra tent or an extra Phoenix down something definitely for the completionist in all of us
830400	831720	And I do also kind of like that
831720	832240	You know
832240	838840	It seems like the abilities that were removed in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's prey ability
838840	844440	Cecil's darkness ability these things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters
844520	849180	That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on advance
849280	850640	Maybe with a new translation
850640	856960	I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD based system even ps2
857480	863900	You know, I just think the graphics would have been a lot better. I I just maybe I'm biased or whatever you call
863900	866880	I just don't like the DS for think for projects like this
866880	873000	I don't like that all these things these redone old classic games are coming out all on the DS because I don't
873520	875360	You know the DS
875360	881960	Kind of lends itself to a different outside the box kind of game making not so much the translations of old games exactly
881960	886680	I think I'll play this more when it comes out on the PSP when we get like Final Fantasy 3 and 4
886680	892380	I hope I hope it does just like they did 1 & 2 I mean because I liked 1 & 2 I thought well
892380	896680	I didn't really like to that much but I I wouldn't have liked it no matter what system it was on
896680	900400	But Final Fantasy 1 I liked a lot on there and I like the way they did it
900400	903760	It doesn't have to be all fancy 3d graphics and to be honest, you know
903760	908980	I think they wasted a lot of effort with it because now they have to redo all the characters redo all the scenes and all
908980	912000	That stuff and for what it just looks mediocre
912000	918120	I don't know and Bobby Blackwell's trying to be cute and chat make a joke. He says confirmed. Oh, LR DS haters
918200	923840	No, I'm not a DS hater. I like the games that are kind of made for a DS like trauma center great game
923840	925540	You can't play that really anywhere else
925540	930480	I mean, I guess you can't on the Wii but that's a whole nother story cooking mama is actually kind of fun on the DS
931240	936360	You know, there's lots of these types of games on the DS even even things like Metroid Prime hunters and stuff that you can't really
936360	939700	Get you know on other types of systems. I don't like
940720	946720	Trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of you know how to control a game
947760	953120	And that's the other thing that's my other big problem with Final Fantasy 4 is that it needs an analog stick
953120	956600	Trying to control Cecil which all these years
956600	962160	I thought it was Cecil but according to the voice acting at Cecil trying to control Cecil in that 3d environment
962160	969040	Where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees it sucks because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little
969040	970820	You know, I don't know about okay
970820	977560	I don't know if if there were other like things that I missed but I you can control the way he runs and stuff
977760	981000	Using the stylus, but I was unable to like interact with anybody
981000	986040	Using the stylus. I had to like stop and push a button which I thought was retarded
986040	990780	You do need to play a little more Final Fantasy 4 and get your wit leveled up so we can do the wireless battle
990780	992260	Because I'm kind of curious how that works
992260	992740	Okay
992740	996920	So play play a little more at least till you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know
996920	998700	How many people I know are gonna get this game?
998700	1004520	Although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy fangirl, it's worth checking out
1004860	1006540	Especially if you've never played the game
1006540	1012200	You've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great
1013020	1017400	But if you have played the old games you you know have already kind of made your way through them
1017740	1023780	I still say it's worth a look. It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper because it's a $40 DS game, but
1024300	1030260	It's not gonna be a waste of your time. It is, you know, kind of a different experience. So there you have it
1030260	1036580	And then Bobby and chat commented again. He said confirmed. Oh LR likes to debunk black wolf. Oh
1038100	1040100	Bobby you're great
1041100	1047460	Game guru says look every port or remake of an nest and super nest for the DS means no PlayStation Network or virtual console
1047460	1051020	Port and that makes me mad. I kind of I kind of agree
1051020	1057040	I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2
1057040	1062920	Uh recreations or any guide because those were great. I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone
1062920	1068220	I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people but I would like to see a
1068700	1073080	New approach taken to it. I just kind of don't want it on the DS. I'd like to see it as a
1074400	1078760	Remade for at least the ps2 if nothing else make it a budget title for the ps2 if nothing else
1078760	1080440	There'll be tons of people that want it
1080440	1082520	We'll see also in my gaming week
1082520	1087640	I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more civilization revolution, which is a game
1087640	1092240	I think is pretty cool, and I noticed Bobby black wolf was playing Civ revolution speaking of Bobby
1092240	1093840	He was playing that quite a bit this weekend
1093840	1099320	So I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on civilization revolution
1099320	1101320	Even though I'm not that great at the game. He'll probably beat me
1102040	1104040	Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it
1104840	1106400	and
1106400	1108400	Also, I've been playing that new
1108960	1111020	Xbox Live arcade game that came out the
1111020	1116420	The street dancing game whose name I accidentally closed the window. What was it the go-go beat?
1118300	1121660	Let me look at go go beat steady, I think that was the name of it
1121660	1125620	I had it earlier. I play I was just you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of go go break steady
1125620	1127780	that's name it I played it for a little bit and
1128460	1130100	I
1130100	1135460	Kind of like the concept. I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this guitar room and style
1135460	1139920	You know buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside and the better you hit them in rhythm
1139920	1143500	Then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma and I kind of thought that was cool
1143500	1149900	It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game
1150580	1154700	But I know there are people that do get excited for that. So I'm glad there's a decent music video
1155300	1159700	Music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone. It's worth checking out
1160380	1167520	But I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music
1167520	1169060	I think it could be kind of cool
1169060	1171060	So that's it for my gaming week
1172220	1176500	Housekeeping tonight before we get into some gaming news honestly don't have a lot just gonna give the same old plugs
1176500	1181720	We usually do for you know, our Facebook community at facebook.com search for the ol army
1181720	1183740	You can join us on there at live journal
1183740	1188860	we are username orange lounge on live journal and we always you know post little plugs for the show or other bonus things we do and
1189260	1195520	Of course our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com our myspace orange lounge radio and our YouTube channel
1195520	1201420	Is that orange lounge radio? I believe is our YouTube. It's been a long time as I've logged into I believe
1201420	1203740	That's orange lounge radio. I've still yet to put my video
1203740	1208140	Yes, you need to put your video on there and I'm gonna be putting the olr PSAs on there as well
1208500	1210840	For the folks that want to hear those again outside the show
1211180	1215900	We're gonna put those on there too, even though there's not a lot of video to go with them. At least it's something
1216580	1221060	All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Shall we sure? All right. All right
1221060	1227380	All right. Well, you know being that e3 was not really this week, but last week
1228140	1230140	There's been a lot of you know
1230420	1237520	Either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it and a couple publishers one being Bethesda
1238040	1244860	has been trying to defend e3 saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit and
1246540	1248620	You know kind of what they've been saying is
1248620	1253320	You know before it used to be very, you know bustling very lots of people in there
1253660	1255660	but now it's just vacant and
1256020	1259860	You know, not that many people come and visit them and I think Bethesda. I mean, they're not a
1260620	1261980	small
1261980	1268100	Publisher by any means but at the same time they're not like I remember when you know you guys visit Bethesda
1268700	1273540	Their booth wasn't that big not compared to like, you know, EA or you know, Microsoft or something like that
1273540	1279820	So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more it's a lot of people might miss going to visit
1279820	1283780	you know these smaller publishers that are there so that kind of sucks and
1284980	1292560	Bethesda's booth was interesting though because is basically imagine their booth space was kind of like a donut where they had everything kind of around it
1292560	1296260	They had some things on display kind of around on the on the actual donut shape
1296260	1300900	but then in the middle where the donut hole would be was that like kind of special room where they were doing their little press
1300900	1303940	events and dark soccer and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and
1304660	1310660	Sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out which that was great
1311460	1317380	Unfortunately, it was one of those games. It was awesome in theory, but the execution unfortunately by the time the game actually came out
1317860	1322580	It didn't work out so well, but we got excited about it watching is it was great in theory
1322580	1327300	I actually taped the whole thing how they recreated the Erathicon battle was pretty awesome
1327300	1333140	I know that was sweet, but yeah, anyhow, sorry, but but they just say that it needs to change
1333140	1337460	They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they you know
1338140	1340140	want to change it, but I
1340580	1343100	Don't know, but yay. Yay another
1344820	1347900	Company also displeased with the current e3
1348540	1355840	Ironically enough though. They're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now
1355840	1358440	They wish to invite the community to the show
1359360	1363000	It's a bit ironic when you think about it because they were one of the companies
1365240	1370360	Complaining that there was too many people at e3 and that they couldn't get any business done
1370560	1376560	So instead they want to go back to where the way it was and then some I seem to remember us bringing up this
1376920	1381340	Almost exact not not exactly sure if I seem to remember EA making similar comments last week
1381340	1385160	Although I think this week it was what Peter Moore that said them specifically and you know
1385160	1390040	Which is interesting because he used to be kind of Xbox's, you know spokesperson at those press conferences and things
1390520	1395040	But it's just interesting. It's not it's not stopping from EA, you know, it's now now here we go
1395040	1397900	Another person at EA kind of speaking up saying here's gosh
1397900	1403400	We missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place, but Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got
1403920	1405480	I don't know they move this way
1405480	1408260	Okay, and I know a lot of people aren't gonna agree with this cuz you know
1408260	1412980	They haven't gone to e3 and they want to I don't think that they should let the public into e3
1412980	1415580	Because as it was it was so fucking packed
1416700	1417700	before
1417700	1422720	You know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts. You're not gonna get anything done
1422720	1426520	What they need to do is find some happy medium between the old e3 and the new e3
1426940	1429500	So maybe lacks up the amount of you know
1429500	1436540	People that they're allowing to be invited these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking e3 anymore because it's just too
1437420	1442540	Strict but before I mean there was people like, you know, Walmart employees that work on their garden section
1442540	1446460	Just because Walmart carries video games. They got in the e3, you know weird shit like that
1446460	1450700	If they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there
1450780	1452780	Then I think it would be a little bit better
1453260	1454580	I
1454580	1456640	Don't know about adding the public
1456640	1460140	I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff
1460140	1464460	I like the format that they have with the press conferences and stuff because it's a lot easier to digest the information
1464580	1465680	And you know what?
1465680	1469220	Maybe it might not be so bad with the press conferences there and actually being able
1469220	1473940	You know since you're not gonna be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's gonna be fucking mobbed
1473940	1477180	Um, I gotta say this this is very interesting the comments again
1477180	1480900	I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving good giving us good stuff tonight Bobby in our chat room and chat
1480900	1483900	I don't want to come he says Peter Moore loved the community
1484180	1488940	Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiasts press last year when Peter Moore was in charge this year
1488940	1493420	They didn't really care about us as much and it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very
1493580	1499060	They're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are you know way more out there with the community
1499060	1502700	And everything I mean heck you can get an OLR gamer pic on the Xbox live marketplace
1502860	1508220	You know that's saying something right there if our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world
1508220	1512400	You know what? I mean? That's you know, it kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community
1512920	1520980	Kind of interesting, but you know, I like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how okay
1520980	1525420	Let's this was the first year that the we I mean it was coming out that same year and that
1525420	1528980	And that booth was fucking mobbed. It was just impossible
1528980	1533540	You couldn't walk through it say you wanted to see a game and you finally did see it
1533540	1537980	You'd take you like 30 minutes just to get out of the booth and it was just awful
1537980	1545100	And can you imagine adding you'll say I'm not saying double that but can you imagine adding like even another half of that?
1545100	1551680	I mean, I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness it honestly
1551680	1557820	I don't I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only but make it you know
1557820	1564600	kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in I think that will
1564820	1569780	Really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, you know
1569780	1574320	Namely us but it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees
1574380	1579900	But I do think there should be room to for actual, you know, the game say I definitely deserve a place in there
1579900	1581900	But you know somehow
1582420	1586380	Screening us that it's really only the people that really work with games in these places
1586380	1592900	I I am actually okay with the GameStop employees of America being with their I do think the types of things that EA if you
1592900	1599580	I like educated GameStop employees who've played the games and stuff. I think everybody does so why why not invite retail?
1599580	1603220	It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know it's like some of these years
1603220	1604420	It's hard to see everything
1604420	1610760	I think that the way that these do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see
1610900	1615100	Everything and then you can decide which you need to go see further. I like that
1615100	1617760	I like that a lot because that works before the gamers days
1619100	1625140	Digest all the information the publishers can make sure that the people that that they have the information that they want out there
1625700	1628700	And if they want to you know further show it off, you know
1628700	1634100	Maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes
1634100	1639500	But you know, hey, this game is playable at our booth. Go check it out, you know, or hey, you know
1639500	1643900	Let's set up some times to come, you know, visit the booth and play the game
1644700	1649100	All right. Well, let's move on talking about more e3 kind of fallout because obviously, you know
1649100	1651540	I know it's been a couple weeks now since e3 but
1651980	1655780	It is one of the highlights in the gaming year and of course Nintendo
1656180	1662280	Got a lot of flack for their e3 press conference. And what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of
1662280	1663840	I
1663840	1670080	Don't know if you want to say they apologized but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception
1670080	1673160	In fact Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week quote
1673160	1680240	We are sorry about the media briefings specifically for those who are expecting to see Nintendo show something about Super Mario or Legend of Zelda
1680440	1683720	If there's any perception that Nintendo is ignoring the core gamers
1683720	1691040	It's a misunderstanding and we really want to get rid of that misunderstanding by any means so an interesting apology of sorts
1691040	1695840	But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these kid
1696120	1699200	Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true
1699200	1706880	I think or at least now it's just I'm saying because all they showed was games for casual people. I mean, no, I hate, you know
1707520	1713760	Distinguishing games between casuals and you know the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays
1713760	1720640	But seriously Wii music is like an over glorified toy. There's no depth to it whatsoever
1720880	1728120	It's just crap, but Loki you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Now. That is a hardcore game
1728120	1733840	That's the thing but a logo Loki exactly, but here's that's that's one thing though that got it got me excited
1733840	1738080	But they don't actually have to show anything just say hey, we're working on this
1738080	1742560	I mean look at a couple years ago. They were showing off a video for Mario Kart
1742560	1747640	Wii it didn't come out for two years after that, you know, same with the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess
1747640	1752040	They had a really early teaser video for a few years prior to that and everyone got hyped up
1752040	1756820	Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3 all they have to do is say, you know
1756820	1761480	You know with that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the you know final product. It was great though
1761480	1766360	It was epic in the making it showed nothing in the endgame the actual endgame footage
1766360	1771000	But it was epic and theatrical and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3 even though they came out for a while
1771000	1776960	Mike a Sony God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name
1777240	1781440	Here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick
1781440	1784360	I don't remember her name the new one that replaced parent Kaplan or whatever
1785080	1792080	That's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on on there. I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games
1792080	1795760	I mean, I honestly she may play the DS and play the fucking brain-age shit
1795760	1800400	And she may be like one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer
1800400	1805840	but that's the problem those because they don't play these games and they don't necessarily have to play it like a lot of games to
1805840	1808360	Be it's not their job. It doesn't to make the games
1808360	1813840	It isn't to make the games but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their you know
1813840	1815840	audience that's what they should do because
1816360	1818140	It just seemed like you know
1818140	1823000	She's a buffoon and so they're having her play this game to make it look like look at this
1823000	1829320	It's a snowboarding game, which is usually more of a hardcore game, but any idiot can play it. So why don't you go play it?
1829320	1832240	That's the whole thing is making it more of a casual thing
1833480	1838120	But they didn't have to do that much. They I mean they just said Oh Pokemon. Okay, this is coming out
1838120	1840540	they could have showed a trailer for that they could have
1841320	1845000	Showed Wario Land shake there's a perfect example of a game that can you know?
1845320	1849040	Be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player
1849040	1852240	Let me ask let me ask dark soccer because she's been awfully quiet through this
1852240	1854240	But I'm just kind of curious of your opinion dark soccer
1854240	1861840	I did Nintendo really make a misstep with this e3 or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place?
1863680	1869600	I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing just because they obviously
1870760	1877400	address the the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market because this the whole
1877400	1884120	Big thing with business is you want to increase your market share. They know if they release a Zelda or a
1884960	1892760	Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market. They have their loyal. We're already loyal. They'd be preaching to the choir. I
1893760	1894960	think
1894960	1898760	Where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince?
1899960	1903520	I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this but they're trying to convince
1903520	1908120	That's this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that
1908800	1913600	Doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press
1914320	1918080	You know, I think that they were smart in doing that
1918080	1921560	I just think there should have been a little bit more mentioned so that like, you know
1921560	1925760	Throw us a bone or something, but it's seriously their excuse though for doing this is like we don't have enough time
1925760	1930440	We don't have enough time during our presentation to make these sorts of announcements and to be honest
1930440	1934480	I mean their presentation was one of the shorter of the presentations out there and
1934760	1939400	How long is it really gonna take to say we don't have any video footage to show you right now
1939400	1942480	But our teams are working on new Mario and a new Zelda game
1943920	1947040	Realize that we are that we already know they're working on some no
1947040	1953320	But they don't have to go and make some sort of claim that you know, oh we're doing this when they know
1953840	1955360	We want to keep these gamers
1955360	1961480	We're gonna put out this game that goes without saying there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete
1961480	1964880	To give us but you know what my wife knows that I love her
1964880	1970680	But she likes to hear it every now one and again, so this is exactly why we have to do this
1970680	1974000	They they may we may assume that they're doing this stuff
1974000	1977800	But you know, what if we don't see it enough? We may not assume it anymore
1977800	1983200	So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore Loki. Is that what it is? Yes, I think that exactly I think Nintendo
1983200	1989480	We need to be cuddled. Okay, we have no more, you know Sega systems yet. We keep getting Sonic games
1990040	1995520	You know Sega knows of their bread and butter is coming from you know, Nintendo isn't you know, it's
1996280	2001040	Have succeeded this long. They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon eating
2001680	2003760	chained to the jungle gym morons
2004480	2008160	mmm, no mention name of people but I
2008160	2016200	I think that when it then they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they
2016200	2019320	Have parameters they have to keep in touch, you know, keep in mind
2019320	2026000	I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out
2026040	2032520	They know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more
2032520	2038480	Curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market
2038800	2044200	But your core is going to come to you every time but see I want to see if this actually works out for them because
2044320	2050000	The problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now the mom and pops that bought
2050000	2057760	You know the Wii system the play Wii Sports now, they're anticipating. Okay. Well, they're gonna buy this Wii Sports Resort thing
2057760	2062720	I hope that's true because if it's not they're gonna end up with another fucking
2063640	2067360	Was a big brain Academy game that came out on the Wii and the be honest
2067360	2068120	No one bought it
2068120	2072760	So there are they have had a lot of missteps in the casual market because they don't underestimate
2072760	2077240	I don't think they really know who they're trying to target. All right, let me let me just summarize here
2077240	2080920	I think all we want is that Reggie all we want is a cuddle
2081280	2086140	But you know my thing and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know
2086140	2089200	Yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a frickin bone
2089200	2091680	Like for instance if we know that in the new Zelda game
2092240	2098620	Link is gonna ride a gigantic spider then like show us the image of link riding a giant spider and you know
2098620	2102800	Put out there link and the giant spider friend coming next fall
2102800	2107700	You know give us something to and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go
2107700	2109940	Oh my god. Did you see the giant spider?
2110740	2115180	Exactly. That's all they have to do. Look at Mario Kart. Like I said, this is a perfect example Mario Kart
2115180	2122140	They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a cart racing around. That was it. Nothing from the game
2122400	2124220	No graphics whatsoever
2124220	2129560	It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that oh my god Mario Kart's coming and it's not like that
2129560	2134180	We didn't see Mario Kart coming because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system. So
2134860	2140780	but still that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate another Mario game I
2140780	2145600	For all I know it could be a crappy and you know, this is gonna come anyways
2145620	2150300	We're like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf and but once again, that's not a hardcore game
2150300	2157600	That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking we to play we sports stop catering the people that play Wii Sports
2158100	2162020	There are other games out there. They sold their systems didn't they true? Yeah, that's true
2162020	2165060	We you know what we would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports
2165060	2169700	I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability just a one little thing. Yeah, this is where it comes down to
2169700	2173560	Bottom line money. What company is out there?
2174300	2181220	You know if they were out there too, I guess be nice and sweet and cuddly that'd be you know, a not-for-profit
2182140	2183380	organization
2183380	2187540	As it is there they have to make money
2188180	2192580	What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America? Your mom has more money than you do
2192580	2202380	Um, well, we've done selective targeting for certain products and we feel that the adult demographic would be
2203100	2208660	Okay, go ahead. Okay. I want to say there's a shower and in chat. It's great. He has a title for my new Zelda game
2208660	2210900	It's called Legend of Zelda web of lies
2212100	2217140	All right. Well what I was trying to say before is it you know, they probably see something. Oh well
2217140	2223780	To expand our market we're going to appeal to a different demographic for aiming towards the older people who might have been our core
2223860	2229820	Group at a younger age. We're trying to reclaim the market that is now quote grown out of video games
2229980	2235780	You should you need to go get a job. Why do you think I was in technical writing for a while?
2235780	2238340	Very nice. All right, Loki final. Okay, then we get him my final thought
2239380	2243540	Basically, it's like this. Okay. It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market
2243540	2247620	The problem is though is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't gonna necessarily
2247940	2252500	Do a lot of good for you. The problem is you got to get people confident in your platform because
2253300	2261580	Come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4
2263980	2268380	You're not gonna have a lot of people, you know wanting to buy your next system because
2268380	2273780	They bought the Wii and that's all they play is Wii Sports. So why do they need to buy your next system?
2273780	2277620	That's the problem. And if you cater these people that are just casual gamers
2278060	2283440	They're not gonna come back for more. In fact when you have people buying that your next Nintendo system
2283440	2285380	They may not buy your next Nintendo system
2285380	2289700	They may just go somewhere else and that's where you're gonna end up hurting. It's down later on
2289700	2294020	I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the Justin TVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read
2294020	2297660	But I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about it in there
2297660	2301460	Some folks are saying a Pokemon MMO is what's needed
2302340	2305580	Could be interesting. I mean Pokemon sure is one of those
2306180	2312340	Universal franchises that sells like, you know, it's free money, but MMO on a Wii would be very interesting
2312340	2316380	That would be very easy to do actually if you think about it. I think so too. Because I mean, alright for example
2316380	2317940	I can't believe it hasn't already happened
2317940	2324780	Well for an example, um, actually a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture
2325740	2327140	your
2327140	2331100	Different creatures as your pets and then once they become loyal they help you fight
2331100	2335220	I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually cat
2335220	2337780	You know if they can do it on a regular video game
2337780	2343620	Why can't they have it in multiplayer format and then you have like for example, like you have your arena system
2343620	2349180	You can actually have your gyms be set up that way, you know, and you've got whoever you know
2349180	2352980	It was like has the best group or whatever. So you have a continuously
2352980	2359340	A rotating list and like maybe your gym leaders like one of the GM's or something. All right. Anyhow. Anyhow, let's move on
2359340	2364860	It's a very very I know you have more Nintendo news, but hey stuff about Reggie, okay
2365700	2368140	Reggie is like, okay
2368140	2375100	we know pretty much said from an America centric perspective to quote that the
2375100	2383100	Weezer storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like we wear in virtual console and he told
2383300	2389780	MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution. So he says that Nintendo is working on something
2389980	2395420	They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something but I
2397620	2398900	Actually
2398900	2404900	Think that they're gonna and while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB based at knowing Nintendo
2404900	2411660	They're going to try to do something proprietary something that can't be mimicked something that no one's gonna be able in theory
2411660	2416940	No one's going to be able to break and just you know hack their own like, you know
2416940	2422860	We used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives. Remember? Yeah, they're going to try to do something
2422860	2428020	That's that they would have control over. It's just frustrating though because they put USB slots
2428020	2432500	They put SD card slots in that we why does it have to be freaking proprietary?
2432500	2437300	You know like it by doing that it kind of showed the promise of Oh mass storage
2437300	2443580	Hey good idea, and it's not being used. I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you be something really simple
2443580	2448340	It could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done
2448340	2454420	It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing. Just open up USB to use storage devices
2454420	2459100	Your problem solved right there. It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer
2459100	2464540	I mean, it's no different than it is gonna make from that. I'm sorry. Where's the money for them to make from that?
2464540	2468060	Oh, you don't have to make money off everything show Nintendo USB drives
2468860	2475780	That they'll release in stores along with that for ten dollars more than the generic brands will cause I still think they're gonna have some
2475780	2478740	Way to system lock and even if they do it via USB
2478780	2482060	they're gonna have some sort of code that you have to read off of the
2483020	2489080	The storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing
2489080	2492700	To hack the system. I think I seriously think what it is. So you that's why it's
2494420	2495500	Investment
2495500	2497140	From a business perspective
2497140	2503060	They're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their power
2503060	2508980	Let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system
2508980	2513380	Well, they were aiming for a certain price for their system. I mean, but they're paying for it now
2513380	2518020	Now the gamers are like now it's kind of like they put the cart before the whole horse with this whole we wear thing
2518020	2522780	Oh great. They're filling up that drive. I can't wait for the special dog and no dongle the attachment
2522780	2525700	It's gonna attach to as well that's gonna give it high-def graphics
2525700	2532380	Oh, maybe we'll get someone that you know, gives us some good online or maybe I don't know one that gives us some better games
2533140	2536300	Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades
2537100	2541900	As I mean think about it. I bet you any this is this is my prediction
2541900	2542260	Okay
2542260	2549140	We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii it's either going to run
2549140	2552180	Off of USB or have some sort of it
2552340	2558020	Either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage
2558020	2565220	Whatever with the Wii and then as it progresses we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something, you know
2565220	2571820	Maybe the you know new upgrade they drop the price the old we bring out the new we at the rigor price of storage becomes
2571820	2577180	You know even more cheap as the you know, time goes by and we're going to get a new Nintendo
2577180	2581660	Yeah, that's why I understand they can't do that now because the price of flash storage has gone down so much
2581660	2587060	They could just say okay going forward now all the ways that we put out are gonna have four gigs of storage instead
2587060	2590060	Yeah, I'll piss off a lot of people but you know what tough
2591780	2594020	All right, I'm was at least
2594620	2597820	There the Reggie admits the problem is out there
2597820	2603140	Even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that the whole American centric perspective
2603340	2606020	At least they they are finally admitting there's a problem
2606020	2610580	Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from
2610980	2616220	Has been and this is at least as far as I've seen to has been mostly the American market
2616220	2620260	So I think he's saying well at least Nintendo of America loves you
2621940	2626780	It's our cuddle Rob interesting I guess maybe that was our cuddle, I don't know we'll see
2626780	2628220	Oh
2628220	2632420	Smack him in the fucking face. Seriously. Oh, yeah, we acknowledge there's a problem now
2632420	2635780	Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that. He needs a little love
2635820	2640940	Would he be so angry if somebody would oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people. Oh, that would be awesome
2640940	2647700	I think that Loki needs something that starts with the D and ends with the E and there's two words. It's called duct tape
2649260	2655040	Loki on my own. Yeah, my only wish is that you know, you take your little media badge at this event
2655040	2659580	This is Orange Lounge radio and you put a sticker over it. This is Bobby Black Wolf show before you go
2660500	2662500	people
2662500	2664500	I'll take it a step further. I'll put my name is
2665180	2672340	Someone follow follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking, but we'll be like, okay interviews over next ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
2673060	2678940	So speaking of newest Rob you would you would love it if I just like put on a mask and like dress up like Captain
2678940	2680940	Anger or something
2680940	2685020	You could be mr. Furious mr. Furious. All right, let's move on
2686340	2690180	Apparently because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing
2690700	2697020	That certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market
2697300	2704540	These would include any a Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks. So any of your classic controllers
2704540	2710420	your GameCube controllers those are going to be taken from the market and
2713060	2720220	Of course the Wii remote and nunchuck are okay because it was only have one analog stick and this is all because of that
2720700	2722540	wonderful
2722540	2730860	21 million dollar patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and escape
2730860	2736540	That has sued them and you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money
2737700	2739700	or licensing rights
2740860	2747460	Do you think it's actually gonna happen I don't know it it's well, I mean they have to pay them because it
2748460	2750460	You know, the verdict has been placed
2750720	2754520	The thing is though there's well second level appeals room court appeal
2754520	2761120	Well escape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make
2762680	2766060	Controllers, I guess I don't honestly think that they're gonna try to make controllers
2766060	2768120	I think that there's money would have kind of done it by now
2768800	2775660	Yeah, Lord. Katsu. Hito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat dot orange hundred calm probably most likely
2775660	2777660	It's usually the way these things go
2778520	2780020	Anyways
2780020	2786520	Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii bonus content feature very soon over in Japan
2786760	2794140	It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16 digit code into this bonus thing and you get a new
2794660	2800920	Present so to speak the Wii speaker channel is the first thing that's supposed to be used using this
2801640	2804520	It's coming with that, you know that game on the Nintendo DS
2804520	2808580	I think we talked about it a few weeks ago that it's kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio
2808580	2810580	translation of channels or whatever
2811500	2818140	Interesting, but there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for we points
2818780	2826740	free download games virtual console sell it and sell virtual console games in stores kind of like what Xbox Live does with their
2826740	2832580	Own redemption system like you can buy Uno or Texas hold them like in a store on a card and give it as a gift
2833460	2835460	So I don't think that's what this is for. I
2836060	2838060	Think if it even comes out here
2838060	2842660	Yes, and I think this the only thing this is it's to deter piracy
2843340	2847860	Because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately
2849940	2855420	Ironically enough though all those bonus things that they're talking about like the Wii speaker channel leaked to the internet anyways
2855420	2857420	So it's not gonna matter
2859380	2861380	Well, there is a
2861780	2864780	Something that I think is gonna be very very very
2864780	2868940	Cool to come out at least in Japan, and I don't think we're gonna get it here
2869860	2876500	But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the purika the print club stuff, but it's actually not quite
2876500	2884340	It's called the digi cam print channel. That's going to be on the Wii. It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm where
2885820	2891140	You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and
2891140	2899100	You can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book. That's
2901580	2903020	1575 yen
2903020	2905180	Or you can get a Mario one. That's
2905820	2907260	2480
2907260	2912560	And you can actually even have them print it out to well you can
2913340	2918120	Have your meshi printed out which is a Japanese business card you hit it's like your name card, basically
2918120	2924040	You know the the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it
2924040	2928640	Mm-hmm, but you can have your meshi with your Wii on it and you've got your Wii be your me on it for
2929720	2932680	500 yen for 30 cards, so it's actually pretty cool
2932680	2937040	I wish we could get something like this would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game
2937040	2939040	I have on those cards, too. I
2940240	2944400	Don't see why not I mean I would think so that actually would be a very smart idea
2944400	2948880	To have you know your your friend could be both you and I need to be working at Nintendo
2948880	2951400	But I'll tell you what and the good idea department
2951400	2955280	And I'm gonna link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down
2955280	2958280	but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube and
2958800	2962640	I'm looking at it. It's actually pretty pretty cool. This is actually a
2963680	2966160	Fujifilm's demo showing how it works
2966160	2971760	And it's it's really really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes
2971760	2973960	And have messages on them
2973960	2978720	It's actually very cool and also send them to to people it seems pretty cool
2978720	2983640	What I'm seeing on this do you think it's something that would work here, or is this is this better for Japan's culture?
2983640	2985720	I think it is it's more
2987560	2994740	Surrounded around I would say how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right
2995260	2998320	Why not I mean if the channel already exists?
2998320	3004520	It's just translation and and on Fujifilm's end you know or whatever company they partnered with in America
3004720	3006720	Just a matter of you know
3007480	3008960	I was gonna say Fujifilm's here
3008960	3014460	So why not fish as long as they have a presence of getting the oh is that are they behind snapfish?
3014460	3020660	I don't know. Oh, I'm mentioning snapfish every you know every photo company has had to evolve to maintain
3020660	3027280	Competition with the digital photography, so I'm sure they have something set up the way that I see this is that if
3029700	3036460	If like say you know rock bands are going through rock band to you know have their musical presence
3037340	3044660	Fortified in the industry when you know everything is digital download and all that then why can't you know the photo companies make use of?
3044660	3046660	This I think it's a good idea
3046660	3053980	And on top of that is it's convenient instead of having to take you know a CD in to have it printed
3053980	3058940	Or do it yourself. You just be no pay 15 bucks and have them send you a photo album with everything in it
3060100	3065100	Game guru in chat says damn sooner or later. They will fill the Wii with just channels kind of
3066260	3069980	Kind of a good point because you know the Wii only has four screens worth of channels
3069980	3073360	I want the channel channel the channel channel the change channel channel
3073360	3078760	Now as unfortunately as they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to
3078760	3080680	Store all those channels
3080680	3082160	Yeah
3082160	3087480	Alpha Kananagrams in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP big fan of the whole
3087920	3090880	Fuji film channel idea all right. We will see
3091720	3095100	Well, this isn't for the Wii, but it uses the Wii remotes
3095240	3099840	there is a brand new homebrew game made called dark room sex game and
3099840	3106880	what this basically is is two people will take the Wii remotes, and they will kind of make a
3107920	3112760	kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the
3113760	3116880	Pornographic sounds there's no images. It's just all audio
3117440	3124880	That you hear on the screen, and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish
3124880	3127500	this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8 I
3127500	3129060	I
3129060	3131500	Wish I had brought my bluetooth
3132500	3135100	Adapter next week though we can maybe do this on the show
3135740	3137220	You know for that
3137220	3140420	For that extra. It's all audio array. It'll be awesome
3140940	3145340	All right, yeah gold banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat weirdest homebrew ever
3145460	3150760	But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there. I believe they have a
3152500	3154100	It's a
3154100	3156100	website itu.dk
3156100	3159300	slash stud slash darkroom is
3163420	3170020	Right and game grew in chat says the kind of obvious comment here. Why not you know have sex
3171420	3177380	Because this is this is safer. You can't can't contract babies or a okay. I see
3179060	3182600	AIDS and baby free I get it, so there's there's I guess the
3182600	3189360	Positive unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had in which case you could probably you yeah
3190280	3192280	You might be able to get genital herpes
3193160	3196860	Herpes maybe using the proper now make it a gear attachments
3197520	3202980	All right, well, please let's change the topic real quick here. I have them and talk about, Castlevania
3203840	3205520	Because Castlevania is pretty awesome
3205520	3212840	Castlevania why Castlevania has to follow a story about a sex game is because Castlevania is sex I mean Castlevania is that good and I
3212840	3216640	Had no idea this was coming, but apparently there's a Castlevania arcade game
3216640	3222680	Akumajo Dracula the arcade and there's been some location tests going on over in Japan and
3223240	3226240	Some folks are already kind of leaking their opinions to the internet
3226920	3231720	Apparently you can actually enter the machine from one side or the other. There's a pretty spacious inside and
3231720	3237320	There was LED lit candles on the inside of the machine which I think is kind of cool
3237600	3243320	You hold a controller that's shaped like the handle of a whip and the top of the whip also has LEDs in it
3243720	3246560	First player has blue one second player gets dark pink ones
3247080	3253600	And then you have a little yellow trigger on the whip where your index finger goes and that is for sub weapons like knives
3253780	3257760	Crosses potions all of that stuff, and then there's another button where your thumb is
3258520	3260200	so apparently
3260200	3262760	And that thumb button is used for items later in the game
3263200	3267760	You stand in a designated spot you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game
3267760	3274120	I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things and then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out
3274120	3278640	And they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them
3278920	3283960	So that's kind of neat and then of course the weapons like knives. They do take hearts. Just like the game
3283960	3288140	That's like 25 heart, so it sounds like a shooting game with like a Castlevania twist on it
3288140	3290280	So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii
3290960	3295480	Possibly there's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii rumors I
3296780	3300280	Think that there's more than one way to do it too. It doesn't necessarily have to be we only
3300920	3304880	This sounds neat in theory though. It does and it sounds pretty cool speaking of Silent Hill
3304880	3310680	I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now. I know Comcast is nationwide
3310680	3315400	I don't know if they're on demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the on demand in HD
3315400	3321840	For free on Comcast on demand so I actually watched it this weekend with William and and he well
3321840	3324400	He'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all
3324400	3328760	He needed me to explain it to him so we watched it, and I did but I'll tell you what Silent Hill in HD
3329560	3331280	very very hot
3331280	3333480	Sweet is very good-looking movie
3333480	3336400	And I I still like Silent Hill as a movie
3336400	3340320	And I hope that I hope the rumors of the sequel are true that they are doing it. I hope so, too
3340320	3347760	Okay, well how about some release dates Rob? How about it? Well for the 30th in the UK?
3347760	3351000	we have double D dodgeball on Xbox 360 and

3438900	3446420	Baseball mogul 2009 on PC and legend the hand of God on PC lots of easy games this week
3447220	3451580	Sounds like fun. It sounds like Soulcalibur 4 pretty much dominating the console really pretty much
3451580	3455780	Yeah, and if you don't want to play a fighting game spectral force 3 looks like a pretty good role-playing game
3455780	3460860	So there you go a very similar story over in Japan doing the Japanese release date
3460860	3466280	So we also have Soulcalibur 4 being a big presence in the Xbox 360 this week in Japan being released on the 31st of July
3466280	3471880	Also a special fighting stick is coming out from Hori to kind of commemorate Soulcalibur 4
3472520	3478400	Beijing Olympics 2008 also coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan going over to the PlayStation 3
3478400	3485040	they're also getting Soulcalibur 4 of course on the 31st, and they are also getting the special fighting stick as well and
3485680	3490360	If you want Beijing Olympics 2008 on PlayStation 3 guess what here you go
3490360	3494720	It's coming out in Japan this week now going over the Nintendo Wii not a lot of games
3494720	3499200	I've heard of before but they do have a Dokapon Kingdom for Wii is coming out on on
3499720	3505280	the 31st as well as Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo is coming out as well and
3505760	3509400	Zero Gesu no Kamen comes out as well this week
3509400	3514240	And that game looks to be like a little bit of a survivor horror type game. So this game actually looks kind of cool
3515640	3520640	Kind of looking at some of the CG from the game. It's like crazy Fatal Frame 4. Is that what this is?
3520640	3523000	Yeah, ah, it's their version of Fatal Frame 4
3523000	3524200	very
3524200	3529760	Cool. I was gonna say that Dokapon Kingdom. That's that party game from Atlas the one that's
3530360	3533600	Promising that you'll ruin your friendship with your friends if you play it
3534440	3540360	Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was on Mario Party type game. Yeah. What about this other one since we looked at the other two
3540880	3543960	Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo looks like I
3544960	3549360	Think it's like a it looks like one of those 200 in game 250 games in a game type thing
3549360	3552960	It looks a little weird. All right, probably not so many people going over that
3553640	3557880	Other systems, let's go to the handheld systems to see what's coming out in Japan. I'm sorry first PlayStation 2
3558400	3562880	Drastic Killer comes out this week Galaxy Angel 2, Gino Express
3563400	3564960	Hoshifuru
3564960	3571880	Kanokan Isui all come out this week on the PlayStation 2 going over to the handhelds and looking at what's coming out there

3619000	3625280	Looking at those releases a little bit going on over there as well fantasy star portable being the most notable of the releases in Japan
3625280	3631880	This week Panic Palette portable and Giga Ojou Somo Denotsu Collection
3631880	3638360	Oh Joe Soma. Yeah, it's the PC Engine best collection. It's a PC Engine best collection
3638360	3640360	It's three PC Engine games
3641240	3644760	I'm not sure what games they are. That looks familiar. I just don't know what that is. They're
3645840	3648940	I'm a chick fighting. Yeah, it looks very familiar something
3648940	3654880	I don't know if it's come out or coming out though that I want from overseas. Hmm. What's that? That's um, the uh, a
3655840	3660140	Fantasy zone collection. I think we've covered it before they're shooters. Just you know, yeah
3661200	3664120	That's really familiar. I probably have a couple of them
3665000	3668840	All right. Well, there you have it your Japanese release dates busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan
3669560	3671080	well, um
3671080	3676840	speaking of other busy events is that um, there has been a little um, I
3676840	3678560	guess
3678560	3684360	Controversy regarding a lack of halo information from what I understand the e3
3686720	3694540	But they actually were saying that halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote
3694840	3697440	Big enough at this point that it can stand on its own
3697840	3703120	so there are a few hints going around and they've mentioned comic-con and
3703840	3705280	other
3705280	3709360	Conventions that there might be a halo con. In fact, um
3710600	3712600	Let me go see if I can't get this
3713360	3715360	name
3715560	3719460	Just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy
3720880	3722880	well, um
3723200	3729560	But it was I guess one of the the higher-ups saying that you can do a halo con
3729560	3735280	Nothing on the scale of comic-con, but you could bring a few hundred people to see a halo thing
3735280	3741000	If there were a Microsoft and bungee endorse like halo tournament uber thing. I bet I bet people would come
3741680	3744280	It depends where they have it Rob. I'd go
3744960	3747960	It won't wait. It would depend on where they have it. I'd go
3747960	3751200	I mean, I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it
3751200	3755040	But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive maybe even la heck. Yeah, who knows?
3755040	3761540	Well, halo con possibly coming soon. I see kidnapped the press to bring him to that. You know
3762240	3765120	Scared the crap out of them. Let's be fun cosplay Master Chief
3765680	3772520	You think there'd be Master Chief cosplay halo con I would hope and Cortana and all your favorite and people dress up like Star Wars
3772600	3778400	Characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is. I don't know why
3779000	3783280	In fact someday when we have a well our con, you know some way it was some day way in the way in the future
3783280	3786120	We encourage people to come as Star Wars cosplayers
3786640	3792920	Yeah, because um, well Microsoft has actually made a games for Windows lives free for all
3793400	3797000	Maybe because the service didn't really I don't know
3799160	3803440	Fulfill what it's promised to be really take off. Yeah, it kind of
3803440	3812400	Didn't necessarily meet a kind of butter. But anyways, um, so yes, if you did pay for it already they are refunding your money and
3813120	3820520	it is effective immediately that games such as like Halo 2 and shadowrun and all future releases are free to play and
3823240	3828880	Actually, I heard another interesting rumor 3 is awesome, I think you're thinking the same thing I am what did you hear
3828880	3830880	I heard the rumor that
3830880	3836640	the games that are cross-platform enabled like shadowrun and
3837360	3840640	I want to say there was another one lost planet
3841520	3849380	Those if you have an Xbox 360 version of you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now and then
3849600	3850800	away
3850800	3852800	to more
3853040	3857960	Things possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox. That could be very interesting
3857960	3864440	We'll see is it because it's probably just competition from things like steam and other products that exist, you know out there all these kind of
3864440	3865560	competing
3865560	3871400	Portals for games on PC so to speak. It's lost planet colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform
3871400	3873160	Yeah, according to act deft and chat
3874040	3878680	Well, I like free so that's pretty cool. Except, you know, what did you hear play Halo on the computer the same thing?
3878680	3885400	Okay, that the silver accounts on Xbox live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit
3885400	3888280	One game I'm excited about when it comes to Xbox live in the future
3888280	3892040	Which by the way, it's not just coming to Xbox live supposed to be on PlayStation Network and Nintendo
3892040	3896840	We wear Mega Man 9 who is not excited about Mega Man 9 what you?
3897480	3899480	Get off my show. No, I'm just kidding
3899480	3901880	This this Mega Man 9 looks great
3901880	3907880	And I think it's cute that they're kind of going the extra mile with the retro goodness of this and an e3 some Mega Man 9
3907880	3913880	Box art t-shirts were spotted and it is the same classic cheesy box art
3913880	3918360	with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art, you know
3918360	3922520	It's like somebody happily great someone in Capcom got the joke. Yeah in other words
3922520	3928600	Well, they are actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog
3929240	3933640	Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art
3933880	3939880	Including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon
3939880	3943800	Awesome. Did you see the other one that they put out? Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other
3944440	3947400	Meatbun.com I think it was what it was. No, it was the
3948360	3950360	1942
3950360	3956040	Pinup girl thing with cami that shirt. Oh, I saw that not as funny. I ordered one
3956040	3959800	Did you you would I need new teeth. That was the other game. I played on Xbox live this week
3959800	3964920	I didn't even talk about 1942 now. That's how you remake a retro game for Xbox live
3964920	3967880	That's all I have to say that was I only played on Xbox live
3967880	3970440	That's all I have to say that was I only played the demo
3970760	3974520	But I was I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port
3974600	3977560	I have in a long time other than maybe pac-man championship edition
3978440	3983720	so just check that out if you were if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases because
3984180	3986360	1942 was pretty awesome. I gotta say
3987400	3991560	I like uh, the 19. What was the 1942 kai? That was a good one
3991640	3996600	But I want to see the the 1940 xx ones remade. Wouldn't that be cool? That would be really sweet
3996600	3998600	but um
3999320	4006620	Going back to the whole retro side of thing is that um, there's a hint that um, Igarashi is planning on doing a new castlevania
4007720	4009320	in 2d
4009320	4013480	For we on we wear that's going to be pretty cool. Um
4015240	4017640	It's uh supposed to be um
4018920	4023960	Trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the castlevania series
4024600	4026120	so, um
4026120	4030600	He says that he's gonna um pay attention to how a mega man 9
4031240	4035720	Uh is with the market and base his decision on that. So that's that's smart
4036120	4041320	I like this trend mega man 9 seems to be starting. Yeah, this could be very good
4041560	4043400	I think it's like, you know, it would also be very bad
4043560	4048760	We love our 2d but no one wants to really admit it in the 3d market until someone just says ah screw it
4048760	4053000	We're doing it anyway, and they're like, hey, they're making money on this
4053000	4057640	I don't think safe for very little money into it. You know, let's do it
4058200	4062280	I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it. I just don't understand why they don't
4063000	4066840	Why more people haven't been doing 2d games they sell just as well
4067480	4069400	People people are sucked in by 3d
4069400	4075000	I think someone figured out where to touch that retro nerve and that was capcom with the the mega man and now they got people
4075080	4077080	Excited now the other companies are going huh?
4077080	4084440	Could could we make money too could could retro goodness be a money-making machine now the problem it hopefully just the pool doesn't get diluted
4084840	4088680	Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything
4088840	4095560	I don't know. I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means actually have to work on it
4095720	4097720	you know versus
4098920	4103480	I don't know just like hoarding something from like the playstation 2 or the gamecube
4104680	4105720	true
4105720	4107240	true
4107240	4109240	this is something that's pretty exciting and
4109720	4113800	I don't know why i'm excited about it since I you know up until a couple weeks ago
4113800	4115800	Didn't know what the hell the watchman was
4116040	4118840	Um, I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it
4119240	4124200	Although I am interested in reading it now. But anyways, um at comic con they announced that they're going to be making
4124760	4129100	Um watchman episodic games on the pc ps3 and the 360
4129800	4134680	And these are going to coincide with the theatrical and dvd release of the films
4134680	4139160	So i'm assuming running up through march and you know, whenever the hell the film comes out
4139720	4145880	And they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storyline. So that's kind of cool
4146520	4152520	and they showed off some footage of it and the first uh, the kind of level that they showed off was with night owl and
4153240	4155640	uh row shot and it was kind of um
4156600	4158600	Pretty cool like beat him up type game
4158600	4164700	Game, they said it's also being um crafted by the person that's uh, or I should say the team behind faith in a 45
4165560	4167560	uh, which I want to say was a
4168040	4169480	game cop
4169480	4174280	Game cock game that was supposed to be coming out. No, actually, I think that that didn't have a publisher yet
4174680	4177080	but uh faith in 45 looked pretty awesome, so
4177800	4179240	um
4179240	4180920	Looks good. Can't wait to see it
4180920	4183240	Uh tiger high in our chat room wanted to point out loki
4183400	4187720	Warner brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of the watchman on itunes
4187720	4189880	The first chapter is free cool
4190600	4193880	So if you're into the watchman, this is a very happy period of time for you
4194600	4200520	Uh, also a very happy period of time for geometry wars fans because geometry wars 2 is coming and guess what?
4200920	4206840	Unlike most xbox live arcade news. We usually have it's coming earlier than anticipated. That's great news
4207080	4211720	Uh, it's coming this week. July 30th is the big day for geometry wars 2 the bad news
4212200	4213640	It's not another five dollar game
4213640	4217880	It's a ten dollar game, but supposedly, uh, this game has a lot of new features
4217880	4222840	And you can even see from the early screenshots kind of like a four player mode in this game, which looks to be pretty awesome
4223240	4224840	um, so
4224840	4231720	I will definitely be checking this out and downloading it and apparently the trial version of geometry wars 2 is like the full
4231940	4233940	deadline game mode including
4234180	4239720	Multiplayer support but only locally but that's still pretty cool that the demo seems to be pretty generous for this game
4240040	4242680	so well, then the multiplayers are online anyways, because
4242680	4247320	You know with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online because the lag is true. That's true
4247640	4251240	Uh, and bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on xbox live for the new geometry wars
4251240	4253720	Yes, there is I downloaded it and checked it out. Looks looks pretty neat
4253720	4257720	Uh, I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat
4258200	4260200	Uh, the graphics have this kind of adjusted
4260760	4265160	Uh, I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what but I have a feeling this might be the final product this adjusted
4265160	4269560	Like soft tone to them that makes it look like an old vetrex game or something
4269560	4273240	It looks like they put vaseline on the camera lens
4273640	4276760	But it it sounds better than loki's describing it
4277160	4282040	It makes it gives a real soft look to it that gives an old 80s game flare. So it's kind of cool. I like that
4282920	4287560	All right, it'd be awesome to have geometry wars on vetrex like someone to do a homebrew game
4287720	4289720	You never know people are pretty crazy
4289960	4294520	All right, uh, this is now the part of the show where we're gonna take a quick break
4294680	4298840	Um, but not until we get to the classic game of the week because we always before the break like to talk
4298840	4304600	A little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness, which how appropriate following a story about geometry wars 2
4304600	4306600	Which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming
4306680	4313320	Dark soccer is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out and this week's title
4313800	4315720	If I'm not saying it's pretty obscure at least it was one
4315720	4318920	I had never heard of until I saw it on because I get I get to know before the rest of you
4319080	4320600	I saw it on the show roll this week
4320600	4329800	So i'm very curious to hear more about this game tonight in dark soccer's classic game of the week
4329800	4337720	The classic game of the week is a game that was on the neo geo systems, um put out by um
4338600	4342200	Sauris is the developer. Um, it's called shock troopers
4342920	4344920	Shock troopers is really freaking awesome
4344920	4352200	Um, basically, it's imagine how like a plane shooter game would be except you're running on the ground and that's what you've got
4353320	4354760	Um
4354760	4361880	You um, basically you can uh fire your guns in eight directions. You can strafe you can um
4363240	4369080	Uh, if you attack uh point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and the extra life things like that
4369480	4372040	You can you actually have a dodge button too
4372040	4377880	There's a team battle mode. Um, you can uh, pick different, uh soldiers in the game and everything
4379240	4380680	Um
4380680	4382680	and actually, um
4382680	4388680	One of the uh, the cool things about this is that um, it was actually intense. It was uh,
4389720	4393880	From what I understand that it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to metal slug
4393880	4398520	So that's actually pretty cool even though it, you know completely is in a different, uh
4398520	4406040	Direction, but you've got uh different characters too. You have jackal who has a grenade for special weapon milky who uses napalm
4406600	4409240	There's a loki in this who uses explosive shells
4409960	4414040	Southern cross who uses a boomerang marie b who has a rocket launcher
4414680	4420760	Rio has exploding arrows maru has grass gas grenades and big mama has a grenade launcher
4422280	4424600	I want to play this game as big mama. That sounds awesome
4424600	4429400	But as you go through the game, um, you can actually pick a different path the jungle mountain or valley
4430040	4432200	um, and you can switch to a different route or
4433080	4438200	Continue on the same so it's basically sort of a running gun sort of sort of game cool
4438200	4441720	The guy has a flamethrower right there looks like a kari warrior watching it. Yeah, it looks like a car
4441720	4443800	Yeah, it is a lot like a warrior a lot more souped up
4444520	4447080	Um, and there's also one called shock trooper second squad
4447800	4451400	Um, that's supposed to be stand alone. Um, no connection
4451400	4457560	Um, and uh, you can only choose the four characters, um, and it has no team mode
4458600	4464040	It is also a little bit more cartoony and um, the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them
4464600	4469160	Um, because it's actually it's a lot completely too deep. The 3d graphics are pre-rendered. So
4470360	4473400	It's actually a release on playstation 2 and psp
4474440	4478440	So that's pretty cool. It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade
4478440	4483960	It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade classics volume one and now you can get it on the wii 2
4484520	4486520	That just came out
4486920	4491960	Really yeah smk arcade. Oh, oh the class. Oh, I thought you meant on virtual console. I'm like really I don't remember
4492120	4495880	Okay, I like the music in it too. It's very, you know, let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear
4495880	4504520	It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it
4508360	4513160	Cool, all right. Yeah, pretty cool. So there it is your classic game of the week shock troopers for the neo geo
4513880	4517640	Pretty awesome. I think it's just the neo geo arcade systems. Well, you know
4518440	4520440	close enough
4520440	4522840	Yeah, it never took that back. It did come out on the um, avs
4522840	4526040	I was gonna say couldn't you get just about any arcade came out on the avs?
4526600	4531160	Is it a hard to find one? I don't think so. Okay. I just had forgotten about it. That's all right
4531960	4536360	All right. So there you have it shock troopers your classic game of the week and we are going to take a quick break
4536360	4539880	But we will be back in just a minute with more of orange lounge radio again

4560040	4563080	Hi, this is your buddy rob roberts here recently
4563080	4566760	I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on xbox live
4567080	4571800	You always can't suck my fucking dick. I just got a dick in your ass. Do I have dick in your butt?
4571880	4575480	Can where's barbie? Yeah, where's barbie? Is that urkel urkel's your barbie, huh?
4575640	4580200	She in malibu or no, please stop spewing hate speech on xbox live
4580200	4585000	It doesn't make you look cool. It won't get you any friends and at the end of the day
4585240	4588060	You still have an incredibly small penis
4594680	4596860	Gaming radio so uncensored
4598520	4604600	And even tom brokaw could get a job with us, uh, mocha mochake orange lounge radio
4604600	4606600	So
4607880	4613400	Welcome back boys and girls to orange lounge radio. We are live here on this lovely sunday evening
4614440	4616440	july the 27th 2008
4617320	4623800	For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat orange lounge radio
4624660	4626280	calm
4626280	4631560	All right, we're halfway there. We got plenty more news to cover tonight. Uh, let's get right into it
4631560	4633560	Loki start us off
4635080	4638440	If you can put you on your ds for five minutes come back to the show you are
4638760	4646200	I'm, sorry. Am I interrupting something loki? I was just playing cord 10 ds. Anyways, um, there are rumors via linked
4646440	4648440	Or I should say a leaked
4649000	4651560	pictures of a I guess a psp case
4652280	4656360	Um saying that the psp 3000 has already been or is in works right now
4656360	4662680	In fact, this supposedly picture is of one of the designs that they I don't know didn't go with
4663240	4667480	and um some of the features though on this design which may you know
4668040	4671240	Reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final psp 3000 design
4671640	4677100	Includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a playstation
4677720	4679640	button much like on the um
4680280	4685080	Ps3 six axis or dualshock 3 controllers, so i'm not too surprised by that
4685080	4687080	I'm, not too surprised by that. Um
4688280	4691880	That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet
4692520	4694520	Because there may be a whole nother
4694920	4696840	psp coming out
4696840	4699020	And i'm sure this one will be completely unhackable
4700280	4705800	Oh, yeah, because sony prevented that now you they they said we're putting stuff to this right now. That's right
4705880	4710200	It's only taking us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it. Absolutely no more
4711160	4712520	All right. Well, what do you think?
4712520	4717880	I mean is it time for the psp to get a remodel or is it too soon or will it drive sales? What?
4718520	4719640	um
4719640	4721480	I don't think it's going to drive sales
4721480	4725480	I mean it might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone it may allow them to do
4725880	4728680	More things with it depending on what features they add to it
4729160	4732440	You know with a built-in microphone you can play crappy karaoke games
4732520	4737160	You can do the stupid stuff that they do with the ds where you can blow into the microphone to do things
4738360	4739960	I don't know
4739960	4742760	Um might be kind of cool to do really crappy skype
4743480	4748120	Without using a headset with it. I guess that's true voice over ip possibly, you know
4748760	4754920	You could do some side talking so sony fans next time. Uh, someone tries to tell you the psp blows you can say yes it does
4755880	4757800	right
4757800	4763160	Or you blow on the psp you blow the psp, you can go blow the psp. Um
4763160	4771000	Um, hey one of the uh, interesting games that was being shown at e3 this year by sony was a little game called fat princess
4771640	4779640	Um, very unique standout title. That's for sure. And apparently the game is playable with 32 people online. Uh, and uh, what's
4780360	4784600	It just kind of looks interesting. It has a very unique kind of art style to it kind of looks like a cartoon thing
4784760	4786760	but apparently
4787320	4792140	The feminist gamers are not happy is his actual gaming blog feminist gamers.com
4792140	4797100	Gamers.com is one gaming blog and shakes shakesville is another one
4797720	4805500	Shakespeare's sister.blogspot.com which by the way great 90s band with shakespeare's sister, uh, these uh blogs are not happy. Uh, they are voicing. Uh,
4805980	4811100	Great displeasure to sony, uh in shakespeare. They said quote congrats on your awesome new game sony
4811100	4816620	I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating
4817240	4820460	heteronormative assholes and then uh feminist gamer, uh,
4820460	4827100	Quoted quote instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with why not go out and find gold
4827420	4832140	To stuff into a treasure chest the more gold in the chest the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry
4832540	4836940	Uh, so obviously some women groups are getting very upset now titan studios
4837180	4840640	The art director there has actually came out and commented on the whole situation
4841100	4843100	after this, uh, he actually um
4843820	4849660	Said does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look characters and everything is a girl?
4849660	4852540	So how about they all just shut up and get over it?
4853980	4858300	Learn to be offended people. It's not you know, if people got their you know
4858620	4863180	Less of a stick up their ass about certain things. I think the world would be a whole lot nicer. Don't you?
4864860	4869340	And notice that the game is called fat princess. It's not saying like all women are fat
4869420	4874060	I mean if they put out a game called that I can see where people might get a little bit offended
4874380	4877820	But it's just a princess who happens to be fat
4877820	4882380	But let let us remember the mika song big girl. You are beautiful
4883740	4887980	What's what's wrong with you know this this is just it's innocent
4888060	4891340	I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this. You know what I mean?
4893420	4894860	So
4894860	4899660	Yeah, there you have it. I'm curious chat. Is it is it offensive or no? Let's see, uh,
4899660	4907260	Game guru says they complain about unrealistic looks for women with laura croft. I guess trying to say, you know, laura
4907660	4911900	you know, it should be called or the game should be called fat princess gets no love and
4912540	4917820	Because she's fat. Let's see. That's wrong. That's right. That's offensive. Uh, janaya says fat kirby
4918540	4921500	I don't see kirby's pretty fat. How how about this?
4922220	4925260	How about lose any sort of social, you know?
4925900	4928620	The the only reason that I think that there's such a bad
4928620	4933280	Social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it
4933680	4937280	It's like why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop
4938000	4945200	Being so fucking offended if you don't have a problem with weight then don't worry about it
4945200	4947040	It's not your problem
4947040	4951040	What if they don't get offended for people? Why don't they just call the game? I like cake
4951680	4953680	perfect
4953680	4959760	Okay, because seriously if cake offends somebody then there's just no pleasing you right
4960480	4964800	I like cake. I like cake a lot. I mean seriously look at me
4965680	4967680	All right. Can we move on please?
4967760	4969760	Loki offends me
4969840	4977200	Well, guess what? What's that? Something that might not offend people. Although people always find a reason to get offended is um
4977760	4980000	There's gonna be more dragon force in guitar hero 3
4980000	4983120	I I the only thing that's going to be offended is my high score
4983280	4987600	With that because if the dragon force songs are as hard as the one in the game i'm going to be screwed
4987840	4994560	well, the songs that some of the songs included are heroes of our time and operation ground and pound and
4995360	4997360	a revolution death squad
4998080	5000000	Nice, they're going to be 500. Um
5000880	5002880	Microsoft points for those three
5003200	5004880	Sounds like a good time. Hell. Yeah
5005600	5007600	I like dragon force good stuff
5007600	5011200	I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck
5012800	5017760	Well one thing not coming to the playstation network anytime soon is wipeout hd
5018400	5023860	Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests. The game is so hardcore. It makes people have seizures
5026240	5028240	So, uh now that's offensive
5029040	5031040	yeah, apparently, um
5031360	5032960	I guess it's
5032960	5041040	I guess it's according to uh computers and video games wipeouts h or wipeout hd's delay is because um
5041520	5044800	A little bit more technical features. It's uh extra features
5045600	5046880	and
5046880	5051360	Apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy tests
5052000	5057120	Can you imagine what would happen if sony had neglected to do that like how much poop they'd be in?
5057120	5063120	In the general populace if they had like just forgot to make that kind of testing and all these kids everywhere
5063120	5065920	Were having seizures because of a video game. Oh my god
5066320	5069920	I guess it's a good thing. They go through all these strict tests before video games released, huh?
5070880	5072240	Yeah in a way
5072240	5076320	It's a good thing. They have all those seizure warnings on their manuals and stuff. That's true, too
5077360	5080800	Um, anyhow the dark knight have you seen the dark knight movie?
5081440	5085040	Kind of yeah kind of neat. No, I'm not going to you're not excited. I don't want to see it
5085040	5088240	Why not? It wasn't bad. It was long. I've decided. I don't want to see it
5088800	5090880	All right. Well your choice it is
5091280	5096480	Movies are expensive these days. It's 10 bucks to go see a movie. Uh, well, they are making a video game based on the dark
5096480	5097760	night, uh
5097760	5099920	And yeah, I know big surprise. That's not news, right?
5099920	5101920	But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps
5102000	5106080	It was actually gary oldman in an interview kind of uh spilled the beans that the game was coming out
5106240	5110880	And it caused this whole like little controversy where a video was out and then it was pulled and now it's out again
5110880	5116560	And all this other dumb stuff not to mention that was also leaked by ign before that. Well, I mean seriously, duh
5116720	5118720	There's going to be a dark knight game duh
5119040	5124000	Duh, duh, they've been making batman games ever since the old nes batman game, which was actually pretty rad
5124480	5128240	The old batman game was awesome. The old batman game was awesome batman returns less awesome
5128240	5132720	But the original batman game was pretty awesome and there's even lego batman and all this crap anyway
5132960	5136740	But um the dark knight kind of funny enough. It was not there at e3
5136740	5143140	Um, but it is still coming out and i'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the blu-ray release
5143300	5147700	Uh of the movie and dvd release of the movie which will be you know in time for christmas
5147780	5153300	I imagine uh gary oldman does is quoted in the video saying quote. It's hard to make a movie like this under the radar
5154500	5158340	Game i'm assuming no he meant to say the movie, you know because the movie things go out
5158420	5163220	But it's just kind of ironic because you know duh the game was coming right duh duh
5163220	5165220	Uh
5165620	5168340	So there you have it uh dark knight the game coming out soon
5170020	5172020	Joy
5172020	5175300	Anyway, um, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because i'm sick of hearing about it
5175940	5177940	That's why I don't want to see it
5178100	5179220	um
5179220	5180020	What?
5180020	5181060	I was gonna say
5181060	5182660	It doesn't make it any worse of a movie though
5182660	5186420	But I understand hype hype machine sometimes kills things and will kind of like, you know
5186420	5189140	If you hear all this hype this hype this hype about something you need to watch it and you go
5189540	5192500	It's good, but it's not great. And that's what a lot of people are saying about batman
5192500	5197140	It's good, but it's not that great of all this hype. I didn't really care about seeing the last one either
5197940	5200500	See, I just saw it at home as a batman fan
5200580	5204500	I think they're far better than the schumacher films which were terrible terrible terrible
5204980	5208500	These new yeah, they don't exist in my world, but these new ones not so bad
5208580	5212900	In fact, really I I I thought this new one was long, but it was worth my time. It was good
5212980	5217860	I agree with my husband. I won't see one until I get a soul, uh, uh a two-face only movie
5217860	5222020	I don't want to say anything as a spoiler. I already know i'm just gonna back up for that
5222020	5226260	But I will say this. I already know I also paid ten dollars to see mamma mia this week now that I would see
5226900	5230660	And i'm going to see x files as soon as I get chance. I will only see mom. I'm sorry
5230660	5232740	I'm sorry. I heard yeah, I heard the x files movies
5233300	5239540	Not hot. I really don't it's fan service though. If you watch the show, you'll probably like it stay stay through the credits
5239860	5243140	You don't want to miss that one. My my point is that
5243140	5248740	My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it. So i'm gonna just see it for myself
5249300	5253060	Fair enough. I won't see mamma mia again though until they let the audience sing along with the movie
5254900	5256900	Were they
5256900	5260340	Dexter game that's coming out for iphones. Do you remember us talking about that before?
5261140	5267060	Um, actually, uh mark echo, um, who is a he does that clothing line and does graffiti
5267700	5272340	um is actually uh supposed to be working with it, I do believe and um
5272340	5278420	It's uh, his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an uh episodic content
5278420	5283060	And as far as I know I do believe that uh, dextre is a a show about a serial killer
5283700	5287700	Who is a uh splatter analysis for the miami police department?
5288260	5290260	so, um
5290420	5291860	He's uh
5291860	5296340	It's a very interesting premise and I think that the the game has a good promise
5296580	5301620	He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to
5301620	5303300	but he doesn't want to
5303300	5305300	So he kills serial killers
5305380	5309940	That's extra special. It's on showtime, which means you know, it can be
5310820	5312820	Which means I won't watch it
5312980	5317540	Yeah, I think they've run it on cbs a couple times like during the rider strike and stuff when they needed programming
5317620	5321380	But you know, it sounds like an it could be an interesting game interesting
5322020	5327940	Keyword i'd just like to see it see what episodic content they're thinking of and the fact it's on the iphone of all things
5328020	5330020	It's kind of it's interesting
5330020	5332980	We'll see how it turns out. I guess tap here to murder
5333620	5336900	Gold banjo and chat says I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome
5337300	5341380	Well, no, I heard a lot of people like it. I just since I don't have show time. I don't really watch it
5341620	5343540	Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment
5343700	5348580	Well last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that grand theft auto 4 was coming out on the pc
5348740	5355140	Well now there's even more confirmation of this first starting off with the pc gamer magazine from malaysia. Yeah, I know that's not
5355140	5361700	Exactly in the us or uk or whatever, but hey, it's on the cover. So that's got to say something, right?
5362820	5368020	um, so they had a big little article about that and um also there was a um,
5368900	5374660	Posting which is now removed on the esrb website. Apparently no one got the memo over at um,
5375620	5380660	Rockstar games about the fact that you can delay when your um posting gets listed on there
5380660	5384900	Oopsie, so it's more or less coming out. Of course
5385300	5389300	Rockstar games is denying that they well, they're basically telling the truth
5389380	5393220	We have made no announcements regarding a pc version of grand theft auto 4
5393700	5395700	But yes, that is
5395760	5397760	entirely accurate
5398100	5399460	Um
5399460	5406100	So, yeah, i'm sure it will be coming to pc. It's not a surprise all the like last few have so
5406740	5408740	And this means hello hacking
5408740	5413220	That's what i'm most interested in is all the mods for it. That'll be awesome skinning
5414260	5421300	How many days let's make predictions how many days before grand theft auto 4 pc has a topless mod?
5421940	5423640	Meaning all the women walk around topless
5426580	5427380	10
5427380	5428420	10
5428420	5433060	I I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves like it'll get pirated before the game's even out
5433220	5435220	And somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out
5435860	5437860	There you have it
5437860	5444500	All right. Well also, uh coming out and uh another port that's highly anticipated although of a completely different type
5444740	5448820	It's the game peggle the popcap game. That's kind of like a plinko on crack
5449220	5450740	Uh, I don't know if you played this game
5450740	5455220	I really enjoy it on the ipod and I bet there would be a lot of ds people who like this game as well. Um
5455760	5461940	Apparently though one at one time this game was denied by popcap as existing but popcap has come around and confirmed
5462020	5465860	Yes, we are making a peggle ds game and it's coming out this winter
5465860	5471300	Um, that's really all there is to say about it right now. But uh, hey, it's it's popcap. It's peggle
5471460	5474740	That means you could already try it out for free probably on popcap.com
5474820	5478020	I think this is one of their games you can try for free and you'll have a good idea what to expect
5478500	5483540	On the ds later this year and it's fun, you know for a casual game. It's a lot of fun. It's stupidly simple
5483940	5488020	You just fire a ball down the little you know playing field
5488260	5492580	It's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although
5492580	5496980	You know pinball has ramps and you know other things that peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat
5497860	5500580	I enjoy peggle. It's a great ipod game. It's almost made for the ipod
5501540	5502420	So, all right
5502420	5505620	This is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us
5505620	5510580	This is a little segment we have here on the show called the orange lounge radio mailbag every week
5510580	5516340	You guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them
5516340	5520740	Right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in
5520740	5523140	So let's open up ye old mailbag and dark sakura
5524020	5526020	Take it away
5529140	5531140	Fresh email comes from azhp
5531140	5536180	Hey, olr crew with all the talk about f-zero gx being one of the greatest racers on last week's show
5536580	5541720	And eager anticipation of a wii title being announced. I figured i'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately
5542260	5546980	Miyamoto went on record saying he wasn't he was extremely disappointed in how sega
5546980	5553300	And how sega approached f-zero gx slash ax and that if f-zero were to be made for another console
5553300	5555300	It would not be in the same style as gx
5555620	5558820	This is probably because it was too difficult hard confusing
5559060	5562740	But in my opinion, it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos
5563060	5566420	That came with playing the game even at the rookie difficulty levels
5566660	5571780	The game was critically acclaimed as well received higher than um, eight over ten for most game reviewers
5571780	5578100	I um, I for one love love loved f-zero gx and i'm more than excited at the thought of another f-zero game
5578100	5581380	Especially in hd, but unfortunately, it probably will never come to pass
5581380	5585460	Let's hope miyamoto comes to his senses and green lights this game because honestly
5585700	5591620	How could anyone not like that game aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something keep up the great work in ps
5591620	5595940	I went to disneyland for the first time in about 15 years and I now realize why you guys trip down there
5596340	5598820	So often it really is a place where dreams come true
5598820	5602900	Oh, I haven't been in like a year. So I don't have my past anymore. So
5604260	5609700	Um, but yeah f-zero, I mean I I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because you know
5609700	5613300	They don't think it'll work. I don't think of some stupid we feature to implement in it
5613300	5619060	That'll make it worthwhile at least I hope I really hope because you know, you're right. It's critically acclaimed and uh,
5619060	5624900	You know gamers that bought it loved it and I I just I hope they do it. I hope a miracle pulls through
5624900	5629940	I hope a miracle pulls through i'm not going to hold my breath, but um, it would just be great
5630420	5633300	Well, how about you miyamoto realize that?
5633860	5635860	Maybe they should actually give gamers what they want
5636180	5642420	Wasn't there actually a dsf zero after ax gx? I still thought I thought there was I I could be wrong
5642660	5645060	It might have been before but I seem to remember there was one after
5646340	5647620	well, um
5647620	5648740	next email
5648740	5653700	Um, hi, olr and this comes from ritual insomnia actually j rod. Sorry. Oops. Sorry
5653700	5660820	Um, first off I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones
5661140	5664260	I work 10 hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on fridays
5664500	5668660	So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make one days easier
5669060	5673620	I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make you guys had your e3 wrap-up show, which was great
5674020	5679460	But failed to even mention a huge huge title gears of war 2 i'm absolutely stoked for this game
5679460	5684180	And you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at microsoft's keynote
5684900	5691220	I actually didn't think about it. Sorry, um, this puts me in a position. I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not
5691300	5693300	Well, you can't get to the ferret so you can't
5693300	5698260	Um, I mean you did make up for by having a discussion about the new, uh game silent hill
5699460	5706020	Okay, you used game a bunch of times homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb stomping sequel
5706020	5710260	How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support
5711460	5716260	My uh, marcus says chainsaw dahlia. Gillespie says for me to be nice
5716580	5721860	I don't know what to do with you people these emails sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks
5721860	5723860	And i'll stop ripping off my signature fools
5724500	5730500	Dude, seriously, it's not like I forgot about gears of war 2. I did not forget about gears of war 2 a lot of news
5730500	5736260	I just didn't care. I honestly didn't fucking care. I hated gears of war 1 and gears of war 2. Guess what?
5736260	5739700	I'm, not buying it and to be honest. I mean there's enough news out there
5739700	5743540	Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of you know gears of war 2?
5743940	5749940	No, I don't need to because guess what we didn't talk about every single demo that they have there. I mean, seriously
5749940	5754820	I'm loling because i'm looking at the show roll and I see what story we have coming out of the mailbag tonight
5754820	5758740	That's funny. Well that that is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty of them
5758740	5763060	It is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty about gears of war 2 prior to that show. So
5765060	5767140	That's what I had to say who gives a crap
5767220	5771620	Well, bobby bobby makes a good point though in chat. He says gears of war 2 wasn't really at e3
5771620	5772980	It was just at the keynote
5772980	5777060	He says gears of war 2 will be playable at packs half of microsoft's booth will be gears 2
5777300	5781620	So even though we did have the playthrough at packs, you know, not a lot of people or I mean i'm sorry at the e3
5781620	5787780	Keynote we didn't have a lot of people. Um get hands-on impressions of the game and you know for for somebody like me
5787780	5792420	Who's not quite as into that series? There's not a lot for me to say other than well
5792420	5794580	It looks like the first one but better a little bit
5796260	5800420	But I don't know I I know there were a lot of actually there were a lot of non-shooting people that were really into gears
5800420	5802580	Of war 2 so who knows i'll give it a go
5802660	5805300	I will give gears of war 2 a go, but i'm not going to buy it the day
5805300	5810260	It comes out like I did gears of war 1, but I will check it out through a friend or something
5810340	5814900	I'll make lowkey loamy his copy if he even buys it or something or I guess i'll just have to get a gamefly account
5814980	5816020	I don't know
5816020	5820660	But I just realized there was a lot a lot of e3 news next week some things fell through the cracks
5822260	5828580	Next email, um, good sunday evening to you. Olr. I trust that. Everyone's been having a nice week so far
5828980	5834500	Anyways, i'd like to say i'm kind of slow on catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my ipod
5834560	5841460	Anymore, I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for olr
5841460	5848340	Since the newer episodes are seven are 70 megabytes now i'm struggling to make ends meet on my ipod very nice format though
5848740	5851140	When I heard the news about final fantasy 13
5853140	5857400	Being a 360 release as well. I tried thinking of ps3 exclusives
5857940	5864420	While the first party fair have been from decent, um motorstorm to best games i've ever played metal gear solid 4
5864820	5868260	I've yet to see many good third-party games. Hayes doesn't count
5868260	5874260	Um, what i'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the ps3 by releasing original innovative games
5874500	5877940	Not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for dlc ports
5879060	5885240	Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off or is it the fact that more people own 360s?
5885700	5889620	But I first can't wait for the naruto ps3 game coming out in october though
5890180	5896120	One last thing with the addition of butterfly and ww and ddrx. I think that konami has gone too far and reminiscing
5896120	5897640	um
5897640	5904440	I mean sure those are a couple of the best songs ddr has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated
5905400	5911000	Uh, the additions are like a slutty girlfriend. She may be nice and all but who hasn't done her
5911560	5917320	That's funny. I mean any ddr player has played butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right?
5917720	5919720	Why add it in a console version now?
5920200	5922040	Well, that's all I have to say
5922040	5928040	For the past few weeks and e3 while disappointing for some did have some very high points until next time katamari's forever
5928200	5931800	This message brought to you by kenya home of the never-ending american ip addresses
5933400	5936200	Well, i'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy
5936200	5941160	Um, you know, obviously there's always gonna people love the idea and some people that don't like the idea
5941400	5947400	I I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your ipod to make it work. I hope one way or another so
5948040	5950040	That's what i'll have to say the rest of it, you know
5950040	5952040	Good thoughts
5953560	5955560	That's it there's more okay
5956600	5961960	Um greetings everyone ron may uh here live from the laundromat show and some heart. Are you at the laundromat right now?
5962520	5963400	No
5963400	5965400	Yeah, well, no looking at the time
5966440	5969960	Before I begin there's a few things i'd like to say to dark sakura
5970200	5974840	Um, i've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit
5975400	5979260	I truly loved and enjoyed everything words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality
5979260	5984620	When you come to nyc, I will give that back to you a thousand fold. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you
5985180	5987900	To rob. I wish we had more time to hang out not enough
5988380	5991420	Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago and fyi
5991660	5994380	Part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show
5994700	5998620	As I said before when you come to new york city, I will give you that back
5998780	6001280	Give that back to you a thousand fold because you're so fabulous
6002060	6005340	To loki you're all right in my book too bad. We didn't get a chance to talk more and
6005820	6008940	Uh and be more chill you were supposed to come join me and jamie for lunch
6008940	6010940	Yeah, I did call you a couple times
6011580	6016140	Um, I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay when you come out here to new york city
6016140	6019180	I will show you a damn good time now on to some other things
6021260	6023260	Oh, wow, this is a long email, sorry
6023500	6024620	um
6024620	6030060	I've said in the past. It would not surprise me that square enix would put final fantasy 12. He said 12
6030140	6037040	I guess maybe means 13, um on xbox 360. Thank you screen x for saving my roommate 400 on a paperweight
6037040	6041040	I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason
6041120	6043940	I feel that konami will put metal gear solid 4 on the xbox 360
6044400	6048000	I'm not saying that because i'm a drooling fanboy, but from a financial point of view
6048560	6053600	The money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the ps3 due to the fact that it has
6054080	6058320	A lower consumer home base and then the 360 that that was the point actually I agree with
6058640	6064800	I'm putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles
6064800	6069040	And speaking of konami people are calling for others to not support konami as a sad reality
6069360	6071440	I understand where you're coming from about this though
6071440	6074400	The whole lawsuit with konami versus viacom is not konami's fault
6074560	6079600	You have to blame ad division about this because they're the ones paying licensing fees to them for guitar hero
6080080	6086900	Everyone is saying that konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides bemani
6087280	6091360	Konami has other titles such as will castlevania contra metal gear solid to name a few
6091360	6096320	Also konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list
6097760	6098560	um
6098560	6102960	I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it. I like the gameplay screens
6103680	6107280	And what annoys me more is that bemani fanboys girls
6107680	6111760	Are going to foam at the mouth because of no guitar freaks drummania tracks in the game
6112080	6113680	If konami added a lot of those tracks
6113680	6118640	They would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game
6118720	6120720	That's my two cents on it
6120720	6123280	Any who keep up the good work and don't stop believing
6124080	6130320	This email is brought to you by joey pisanos on mulberry street in the heart of little italy home of the 595 lunch specials
6130320	6132160	You'll love pisanos
6132160	6137840	And also by anime jam sessions the newest anime cosplay podcast cheap plug. Yep
6138880	6140880	um
6141200	6143200	Yeah, uh
6143680	6146160	I I I like what black hole is saying in chat right now
6146160	6151040	I'm, just reading does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see because that's one of the symbols
6151840	6153840	No, I I don't agree with him that
6154560	6157600	If you put some bow mai tracks in there that alienate, you know
6158880	6164000	The people that were gonna buy it or whatever. Um, I mean look at some of the tracks that they have in guitar hero
6164400	6171280	That are unlockables like their bonus tracks that are non-life either independent artists or you know, um
6171920	6173920	at the time harmonics, um
6173920	6179600	Artists like kind of like freeze pop and stuff. I mean i'm pretty sure freeze pop isn't main, you know
6180160	6185440	A mainstream artist that everybody would love. I mean because some people find them annoying like me
6186080	6186640	um
6186640	6194400	And so some of the guitar hero tracks or guitar freaks tracks could easily be unlockable songs in that but no
6195040	6197040	That would be you know
6197040	6200480	Trying to even incorporate their old audience into it. Oh, well that
6200480	6205760	That would be awful. I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game
6205920	6212560	Whereas the other people may not buy your game. So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already
6212960	6214960	To buy that game
6214960	6219680	On the other topic. I agree with his reasoning for the final fantasy 13 on the xbox 360
6219680	6222640	It just makes sense that they want to get up make sure they get all the development costs back
6223120	6226160	By making sure they get a good share of the u.s
6226880	6228000	marketplace
6228000	6233360	Um marketplace, um, although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a playstation 3
6233440	6236720	Just to get it for final fantasy. Um, 13 myself being one of them
6236960	6239680	But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it
6240400	6242400	So there you have it
6243040	6245680	Any more emails tonight one one more
6246960	6248640	Hey, olr
6248640	6251600	Hi, i've been thinking about starting to play world of warcraft
6251600	6255600	But the 15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget
6255600	6259440	I would like everyone's opinion on whether it is whether or not it is worth
6259520	6264100	The fee is guild wars or another mmorpg without a fee a viable alternative
6264400	6269440	I heard that there are free private servers for world of warcraft as well. Are these legitimate? No
6270160	6273200	They're not very good time. Keep on keeping on seth
6274080	6275520	um
6275520	6279840	I honestly world of warcraft. I got very burned on it very quickly
6280240	6284080	I suggest if you can find like a a trial
6284080	6286480	Try out a trial of it, you know, see how you like it
6287040	6290400	But guild wars I think will be better for your money
6290800	6294640	If you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already
6295040	6299840	Or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free, uh, ragnarok online server
6300560	6305200	I I agree though that guild wars is a viable alternative to world of warcraft. I mean, it's different
6305200	6309920	You can't you can't say they're the same game because they're not the way they you know at glance
6309920	6312400	They look the same and even at first kind of when you're first playing them
6312400	6316800	You're like, oh there's a lot of similarities, but kind of the way the end game works is much different
6317120	6322800	I mean guild wars is really, you know about guilds warring in the in the kind of final end stages
6322800	6326800	There's only 20 levels in the game after all, um kind of a little more pvp-ish
6327200	6330560	But I do think uh, you know warcraft is a lot of fun
6330640	6332480	Obviously i've been playing it for a long long time
6332480	6337280	But I mean if that's really all your gaming budget really going to warcraft in that case
6337280	6342160	Um, I I would agree check out a demo you can get a demo for two dollars or if you know anybody
6342400	6347440	Uh that is already in warcraft hell if you email me i'll get you a freaking code so you can download a 10-day demo
6347760	6351360	Uh any player in the game can has access to be able to do it through the warcraft website
6352000	6354000	And you can download the client online
6354240	6355200	so
6355200	6360160	Very very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game
6360800	6364800	and you know, I I actually I sort of had the thought of uh,
6364800	6366800	Giving it one more go myself
6366880	6371680	I mean I got really annoyed with it and but I figured if I you know
6371840	6375040	And this is what I always do is that I play for a couple months and quit again
6375840	6377840	so
6377840	6381360	I guess being in school. I'm not gonna really have a whole lot of time to play but I was thinking of
6381760	6387280	Maybe giving it another go just it got really boring blood elves are hot. They are
6388000	6390000	But it got really boring
6390000	6393680	Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time. Yeah, it was. Oh, I couldn't remember
6393680	6400720	I couldn't remember. I had just upgraded. Oh, wow. Okay. Remember? Yeah, that's right. I remember I remember. Yeah
6402000	6402800	All right
6402800	6403920	So that's it for the email then
6403920	6404240	All right
6404240	6408400	If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launcher trader.com is the place to send those emails
6408960	6412800	For now loki is going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic. Yes
6413360	6417520	Uh, how ironic all of this, uh gears of war 2
6417920	6422400	There's some new things been announced about it including that they're going to have some content
6422400	6426560	For gears of war 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from gears of war 1
6427120	6433040	And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had. So that's kind of neat
6433520	6439760	And also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for halo 3
6440480	6444560	which will be the 130 lancer bundle that will come with a
6445040	6449920	Lancer, um, yes a miniature replica model of a lancer. What game is this again?
6449920	6453200	Gears of war 2 i'm getting gears of war 2
6454480	6458240	It's not the same kind of lancer that you're thinking of. It's a chainsaw gun
6461440	6463440	I still want one
6464000	6468320	All right, I like everything lancer, what about the whole achievements thing
6469680	6473680	The whole achievements thing. Yeah. Yeah, I mentioned that. Oh, sorry. I spaced for a minute
6474400	6477200	I don't know. What do you think of it though? It's an achievement horn. I think that's kind of cool
6477200	6480720	Yeah, I think it's something they should implement in other games. It will get you to buy
6481600	6487520	Some of their older games like gears of war especially for the achievement horror in all of this exactly you make the announcement now
6487920	6492900	They just released that gears of war refresh time to buy your copy of that for like 39.99
6494000	6498800	And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff. They used to do that kind of with um,
6499360	6506000	Burnout actually remember um burnout like uh, three and stuff like that. They used to burn out revenge actually did this
6506000	6513520	Um, if you had a game save for burnout 3 you got a car from burnout 3 and then also if you had a madden save
6514000	6516240	Um, you got the madden van
6516960	6522400	In burnout so interesting. I don't understand why they don't do this more often. But yeah, whatever
6523280	6525200	All right
6525200	6526080	Um
6526080	6527600	Cool, I like the idea
6527600	6530400	Uh, but I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements
6530400	6535920	But one game I am definitely considering buying is mortal combat versus dc universe because I actually like mortal combat quite a bit
6536240	6539440	And as even though i'm not as huge into comic books as some other people
6539760	6546560	Um, I think the dc universe characters are pretty good and you know tons of people have joker fever right now because of you know
6546560	6552080	The new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on lots of people
6552400	6554000	Uh loving the joker right now
6554000	6556720	And so it just was fitting that this week at comic con
6556720	6562800	It was announced that the joker has been added to the roster of characters for mortal combat versus dc universe
6563440	6569040	Also, though it didn't stop there jax and katana from the mortal combat side are both confirmed for the game
6569040	6573840	Which I think are kind of must-haves especially katana. Um, jax is a really cool character, too
6573840	6580560	So i'm glad they have him there. Um also from the dc comics world green lantern is also going to be in the game
6581440	6583920	That could be pretty cool. Maybe seals. So there you have it
6583920	6587120	Um, now the question is since uh villains
6587660	6594800	Supposedly could have fatalities even though heroes count because the whole dc comics rules could the joker kill people in the game
6595200	6596320	I don't know
6596320	6597760	I I don't
6597760	6602640	I think even if their fatalities are going to be really um kind of softened down. You're not going to see any head ripping
6603180	6604720	honestly
6604720	6606320	If it's the joker
6606320	6608320	You don't know what he's going to do
6608320	6613040	I think that if they give him fatalities they either should or shouldn't go off at random
6613040	6617760	Like like if he pulled out a gun it either blow their head off or like punch him with a big fist or something
6618000	6623280	Nice idea. I like that or like say bang because this is the joker you don't know what he's going to do
6623520	6625520	He does this to freak you out
6625920	6631040	That's a good idea. That would that would be very joker and then you know, you could get like bang bang bang
6631120	6636400	You know three things in a row and right when you think oh, it's not gonna happen. Boom headshot. So
6637280	6639280	uh game guru, uh
6639280	6643920	Uh, um hypothesizes the joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room. Um
6644480	6649520	Zennane chat says jax was booed when he first came up at the panel. That's sad. Jax is cool
6649520	6653520	He has mental arms because they he he's got his own fatality done on him somehow
6655760	6657760	Oh
6657840	6662560	I would like to say that I have some interesting news. Oh, really
6663440	6665440	Yes, really and this makes me quite happy
6665440	6672240	Um, although i'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned. Um, well that we don't have in show role
6672240	6676240	But ties into this, uh, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago
6676960	6678160	um
6678160	6683520	there is actually um a rumor stating, um, and this actually, uh was going on at a
6684320	6686320	san diego comic con 08, um
6686880	6689120	marvel studios president of production
6689120	6695440	Um was saying, uh, well, they were actually asked if there would be another marvel versus capcom and he said yes
6695440	6697440	And maybe sooner than you think
6698560	6704400	So, but the other thing i've been reading is that when and you know, i've covered this on the show before um,
6704720	6711520	Tatsunoko versus capcom which by the way, there's more stuff out more characters in it including a hurricane polymer
6711600	6712800	kashan
6712800	6714240	gachiman
6714240	6715600	um
6715600	6717600	The robot one I can never remember the name of
6717600	6719600	um tekkeman
6719600	6724480	And for for anyone who's like and also batsu is in it from rival schools. Um, uh,
6725120	6727440	morrigan, um, just a bunch of you know characters
6727440	6733840	But going back to the the marvel, uh versus capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um, the current test machines being out
6733840	6739200	In japan for tatsunoko versus capcom that marvel was sort of like, uh, we want to make money off of this again
6739600	6744640	Since you've got this brand new shiny fighting game engine. We want to use it, please
6744640	6748240	Except we're sort of licensed out right now, but it would still be nice
6749680	6750800	Please
6750800	6753600	Aj mixx wants to see some power stone characters
6754240	6758320	There actually from what I understand they have a uh for tatsunoko versus capcom
6758480	6760800	And actually if you give me a second i'll get the character list for you real quick
6761120	6766080	Um, the actual full trailer of for tatsunoko versus capcom is actually up on um youtube right now
6766080	6770080	You can find it easy just looking up tatsunoko versus capcom, but give me just a quick sec
6770080	6774640	I just think the whole thing is interesting. I I this always makes me laugh how you have, you know
6774800	6780480	The street fighter and mortal combat were always kind of like these two, you know competing franchises in the fighting game world
6780560	6784960	And you have dc comics and and marvel or the two in the comic world
6784960	6790320	It's just really funny how the cards fell and you always have marvel versus capcom and now you have mortal combat versus dc
6790480	6794800	Finally after kind of all these years when you would think this team-up would have happened a while sooner
6794800	6801600	Okay, so far I don't have the the full list of everything. Um, okay here's what we have so far for the list of tatsunoko
6801600	6808640	Versus capcom characters. We have um, awashi no ken who is a g1 for gachaman. Um, kashan from uh,
6809280	6815920	The kashan anime tekaman from tekaman the space knight yataman number one from yachaman hurricane polymer
6816240	6820160	and uh gold light on from golden warrior gold light on and from um,
6820160	6826480	Capcom, there's ryu chun li batsu from rival schools alex from street fighter 3 morgan from um
6826880	6829440	Darkstalkers and silky from onimusha dawn of dreams
6830320	6835120	So it's actually on location test. Um in tokyo right now. Um,
6835760	6840640	And hopefully i've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more. Um,
6841280	6845360	As far as an actual release date soon. In fact, i'm pulling up another
6845360	6852160	Uh list here that they're saying a december 2008 actual release window. So that's fairly cool
6852160	6854640	I hope they they add more characters, though
6855280	6860240	I really do but the poster though seems to be pretty finalized the one that they've got out now
6861840	6865840	All right, i'm just surprised I I want speed racer as a hidden character
6866720	6868880	That was a tatsunoko production thing
6868880	6876400	Lord katsuhito in chat says tatsunoko versus capcom could come to the u.s. It just depends on who holds what license to which tatsunoko anime
6877440	6879920	Still is going to be a pain in the ass though, you know either way
6881040	6882880	So, you know what?
6882880	6885040	I i'm gonna import it no matter what so
6885760	6887040	got to
6887040	6891840	You love gachaman and all those other characters. I I would not that news does not surprise me one bit
6891840	6900080	All right, um, well if you have been following core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the playstation network
6900720	6902960	You'll probably have figured out that
6903840	6910400	If you have purchased the I want to say the august version of core and whatever one just came out
6910960	6913840	You'll actually be able to get into the
6913840	6922320	Resistance 2 beta this september and um, also there will be some other ways to get in besides that
6922960	6930080	According to my resistance dot net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game
6930960	6934080	And they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon
6934080	6938080	But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access
6938080	6944240	But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access
6944240	6950800	But if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new naruto game
6950800	6953520	But you get into um the resistance beta
6955680	6956800	Huh
6956800	6961600	I I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing. That's been very popular lately, you know
6961600	6963840	Whatever happened to the good old, uh fashions, you know
6964720	6966480	sign up for it
6966480	6969840	You know, it doesn't go out to the public at all. It's just friends and family, even that.
6969840	6970760	I don't know, it's a little silly.
6970760	6972280	The pain for demos have been around for a long time.
6972280	6975760	Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation Magazine to get your demo disc?
6975760	6976880	Doesn't mean I like it.
6978720	6980120	Doesn't mean I like it one bit.
6982120	6985560	Do you, will you sign up for, you like Resistance, will you sign up for a core membership?
6985560	6990120	No, because it's a 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer.
6990120	6993680	I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested.
6994720	6995600	Well, then there you go.
6995600	6999720	All right, well, I think we need to get, give out an award for stupidity.
7004800	7009040	Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that.
7009040	7010480	It's much easier this week.
7010480	7015520	It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC.
7015520	7018560	Congratulations, you're the wiener of the stupid award this week.
7018560	7026880	Here's why. It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle.
7028080	7032360	Now, I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle,
7032360	7037840	as long as they use, you know, figures or sales or even history, for God's sake.
7037840	7044240	I don't care, but here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war.
7044240	7049040	It's because her son said so. Her 16-year-old son said so.
7049040	7054840	He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened.
7054840	7058040	He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed.
7058040	7063840	After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4 as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline and the awesomeness of Blu-ray,
7063840	7069440	he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in.
7070840	7074040	As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you at the PlayStation.
7074040	7075840	Neither did I, he replied.
7075840	7082040	Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that,
7082040	7087240	that he kept on top of all the stuff going on in the industry.
7087240	7093840	I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out.
7093840	7099840	I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion.
7099840	7107840	I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact, kind of.
7107840	7113840	I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war.
7113840	7116840	I don't know. Either way, it's retarded.
7116840	7120840	And this shouldn't be reported on CNBC.
7120840	7125840	Which is Financial Investor Network. That's the problem I have with it.
7125840	7131840	And the whole thing sounds like a big old, you know, I want a PSP for Christmas thing.
7131840	7138840	Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next.
7138840	7154840	Music
7154840	7163840	I would like to say F you to whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition.
7163840	7166840	My grandmom is in the hospital right now.
7166840	7169840	It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that.
7169840	7173840	I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her.
7173840	7181840	And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, in other people.
7181840	7186840	And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on.
7186840	7190840	So, you know, I guess genetics, too, have something to do with it.
7190840	7199840	But I just, you know, F you to the fact that my grandmom's in the hospital, that there's something wrong that required her to be there in the first place.
7199840	7201840	Well, I hope she gets better.
7201840	7204840	Well, I'm sure she will. She's going in for surgery on Tuesday.
7204840	7206840	And I'll tell you guys more often.
7206840	7208840	Sure, that's fine.
7208840	7209840	Alright, Loki.
7209840	7214840	F you to people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people.
7214840	7217840	Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use?
7217840	7222840	And I'm like, no. I don't own a cell phone at all.
7222840	7224840	So, get the fuck off.
7224840	7226840	That's it.
7226840	7238840	Speaking of genetics, I guess I'm going to also give a similar F you tonight because it looks more and more likely that I am going to have my gallbladder taken out later this year as part of the reason why I have my whole pancreas issues in the first place.
7238840	7242840	And although it's not a big deal, a lot of people have had it done. It's pretty common right now.
7242840	7248840	It just... surgery sucks. Period. So, I'm not looking forward to that.
7248840	7253840	And that means that I am going to be out of Orange Lawn's radio for probably two weeks at some time in the fall.
7253840	7257840	I don't know when, but that will be coming up where I'm not going to be able to do the show for a couple weeks.
7257840	7265840	So, it's too early to speak to what's going to happen during that period, but it's going to happen.
7265840	7268840	So, wait for it.
7268840	7270840	F you to that.
7270840	7275840	Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news.
7275840	7277840	DarkSakura, what you got for us? Come next.
7277840	7280840	Oh, just some stuff.
7280840	7282840	Cool. I like stuff.
7282840	7289840	Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked?
7289840	7300840	Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock remixes are actually going to be...
7300840	7304840	And this is just going to give me a second, because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze.
7304840	7313840	But some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remix.
7313840	7316840	At least as far as I can see on here.
7316840	7324840	So, I think that's pretty cool. They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on their remixes.
7324840	7328840	DJ Pretzel, we've actually had a few of the stuff on here.
7328840	7337840	Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley, I guess I don't see a nickname for him, but I think that's pretty cool.
7337840	7342840	They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the game itself.
7342840	7348840	I agree, that is pretty cool. Kudos to Capcom. You're doing a lot of stuff right this year. Good for you.
7348840	7350840	I figured it out.
7350840	7355840	Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon.
7355840	7367840	You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month.
7367840	7371840	Well now, what if it's Nintendo holding onto it? What if it's Nintendo's fault?
7371840	7375840	Oh wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault. That's just lies.
7375840	7377840	That's what I thought.
7377840	7386840	But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.
7386840	7394840	Players of course will be able to control both animated characters and hilarity will ensue from there.
7394840	7404840	No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series.
7404840	7406840	So, that's kind of neat.
7406840	7409840	Episodic gaming is the wave of the future.
7409840	7412840	Hey, over at Telltale, yeah, that's kind of where they make their bread and butter.
7412840	7417840	But you know you're in good hands over there, so that's going to be very interesting I think.
7417840	7421840	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to our Skype line at www.orangelaungeradio.com.
7421840	7427840	Click on interact with us for all the details. It's OrangeLaungeRadio is our username on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7427840	7435840	But first, one last story, and it has to do for those of you guys, you know, if you are in the OL Army on Facebook, then maybe you're a Scrabulous player.
7435840	7439840	But the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally.
7439840	7446840	Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game.
7446840	7455840	Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January.
7455840	7464840	So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on the folks that have created the Scrabulous game and is demanding that Facebook pull the application immediately.
7464840	7466840	They even put out a whole little press release on it.
7466840	7470840	It should be noted, one interesting part I kind of liked in the press release here is it says,
7470840	7478840	between the classic board game, Facebook, Pogo, the iPod, and the iPhone, our members can now play their favorite game virtually anytime, anywhere.
7478840	7484840	Alluding to the fact that there is an actual Scrabble application on Facebook that people seem to not be using as much.
7484840	7487840	Maybe because Scrabulous was already kind of out there at the time.
7487840	7494840	So, I mean, the lawsuit kind of makes sense, I hate to say it, but if you've played Scrabulous, it's Scrabble.
7494840	7497840	There's no denying that.
7497840	7500840	But at the same time, it got old.
7500840	7502840	Like, I know there's a lot of people that play Scrabulous on Facebook.
7502840	7505840	I played it like once or twice, and I'm like, okay, bored now.
7505840	7510840	I mean, Scrabble's fun, I think, in person, but not quite as fun over the internet for me.
7510840	7512840	That's just my opinion.
7512840	7515840	Are you a Scrabulous player at Dark Sakura?
7515840	7517840	Sometimes.
7517840	7519840	Yeah? Alright, that's cool.
7519840	7521840	I mean, it's a fun word game, but I don't know, it got old for me.
7521840	7523840	It's always the same people I want to play to.
7523840	7528840	And then, you know, when I first installed the application, I got like all these invites to play a game,
7528840	7532840	and I just, you know, I can only handle like one game at a time, alright?
7532840	7533840	Alright.
7533840	7538840	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
7538840	7543840	The Skype line is now open for business.
7543840	7545840	Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7545840	7547840	Hey, it's LordKatsuhito.
7547840	7550840	Is it now? What, you changed the name tonight?
7550840	7554840	Are you referring to that in the Jedi sense?
7554840	7556840	Maybe.
7556840	7559840	Do not start singing the Bughram song.
7559840	7561840	So, Rama, you already had an email read tonight.
7561840	7563840	This phone call better be good. What's up?
7563840	7566840	I want to talk about Fat Princess.
7566840	7569840	I want to discuss this game, okay?
7569840	7570840	Please do.
7570840	7573840	That alone makes me want to drop the 400 bucks for a PlayStation 3.
7573840	7575840	Really? Why?
7575840	7577840	The game looks fun. I'm sorry.
7577840	7586840	It looks fun. I've spent money on frivolous things, but that'd be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game.
7586840	7592840	And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up. I mean, really.
7592840	7600840	Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure.
7600840	7604840	Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360.
7604840	7609840	Not the sole reason, but a big reason. I would say Xbox Live in general was.
7609840	7616840	It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way.
7616840	7618840	Sure, go for it.
7618840	7621840	The feminists are bitching them on about Fat Princess?
7621840	7626840	I mean, where were they when all these games were coming out where the hero had to go rescue their heroine?
7626840	7629840	Where were they? They didn't say Jack. They said nothing.
7629840	7638840	Now the game with a fat cat, now they run their mouths? Feminists, gaming feminists are a bunch of fucking hypocrites. That's it.
7638840	7647840	I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times. Why not? Why not?
7647840	7649840	Just kind of throwing that idea out there.
7649840	7653840	And then roll her over one of those switches in the dungeon to solve a puzzle.
7653840	7655840	No, no, no. You know what, though? I would like to see more.
7655840	7659840	Why not? If we're going to go for diversity in this sense, let's go for diversity all around the board.
7659840	7665840	But this just goes into the whole fact where we need more gay people in games, we need more people of color in games, we need, you know.
7665840	7669840	There's a simple solution. Everyone, get over it.
7669840	7671840	Be more open-minded.
7671840	7679840	I'm never going to stop playing games, but it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like to's, and I'll still play Fat Princess.
7679840	7681840	No.
7681840	7683840	Alright, any other thoughts, Rama?
7683840	7685840	Don't stop believing.
7685840	7687840	Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend.
7687840	7693840	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be.
7693840	7699840	Let's see, comments in chat.
7699840	7703840	GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.
7703840	7707840	Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke, let it be.
7707840	7721840	You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it, this offends me, and then bitch.
7721840	7723840	I don't like it, this offends me.
7723840	7731840	Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easy going and go with the goddamn flow?
7731840	7739840	I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things.
7739840	7741840	Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work.
7741840	7747840	That's a good thing, you know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like.
7747840	7749840	You don't have to have a hissy.
7749840	7755840	Just say, I don't like this, and then get over it.
7755840	7759840	You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something, I don't know.
7759840	7766840	Some comments in chat, SSJ100Matt says, maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles.
7766840	7767840	Why do you think she wears that dress?
7767840	7769840	Um, Shaoran, it's a slimming dress.
7769840	7774840	Shaoran says, we need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.
7774840	7777840	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
7777840	7779840	Nah, it's Legend of Zaku.
7779840	7781840	Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?
7781840	7785840	Uh, nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all.
7785840	7787840	Yesterday's what party?
7787840	7793840	Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, masses of rock band, lots of booze.
7793840	7796840	I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party?
7796840	7798840	Because you don't have a party without rock band.
7798840	7800840	Alright, then it officially was a party.
7800840	7804840	Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band.
7804840	7806840	And I left after an hour and a half.
7806840	7810840	But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia.
7810840	7813840	And that got me to stay as long as I did.
7813840	7815840	Because lumpia, good stuff.
7815840	7818840	Anyway, sorry Zaku, I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food.
7818840	7821840	What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight?
7821840	7825840	Well, let me see, the whole, I'm trying to think right now.
7825840	7831840	The fact of the matter that, you know, Street Fighter IV and, you know, the state of the arcades in this country.
7831840	7837840	The fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machine.
7837840	7848840	But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore.
7848840	7852840	Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami.
7852840	7854840	And, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too.
7854840	7856840	I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven?
7856840	7858840	And DDR of course, they a little more forgiven?
7858840	7860840	Well, that's DDR, that's an exception.
7860840	7865840	You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades.
7865840	7875840	And then all of a sudden, you know, especially in America, you know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved.
7875840	7881840	I would say true statement because Street Fighter II, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades.
7881840	7884840	It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo.
7884840	7889840	It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge, 15 years ago even.
7889840	7898840	And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, doing, making efforts to, like, help.
7898840	7906840	Instead of, you know, instead of just beating around the budget saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only.
7906840	7912840	How come these arcade, here's a question, how come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades?
7912840	7918840	I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades.
7918840	7919840	I wonder why not.
7919840	7921840	Well, think about it, it's a risk.
7921840	7929840	You see the current state of, you know, the current state of the economy right now and how gas is, like, ridiculously expensive.
7929840	7932840	People are trying to save as much money as possible.
7932840	7938840	So, the first things to go in tough times like these is entertainment.
7938840	7941840	I guess I can see that.
7941840	7949840	And the fact that, you know, the consoles have pretty much given, you know, given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out.
7949840	7954840	Because they're out doing the graphics.
7954840	7956840	I guess I can see that.
7956840	7958840	Well, I don't know, what do you think the answer is?
7958840	7961840	When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever?
7961840	7962840	What's it going to take?
7962840	7968840	It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
7968840	7970840	That's a good saying.
7970840	7975840	It takes effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games.
7975840	7978840	Capcom, Konami, you know, the others.
7978840	7987840	They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades.
7987840	7990840	The ones that are struggling just to get by.
7990840	7992840	At least help them out a little bit.
7992840	7993840	Alright.
7993840	7996840	Zaku, anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?
7996840	8000840	Um, let me see.
8000840	8011840	Yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole, you know, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it.
8011840	8012840	It's done.
8012840	8016840	It's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference.
8016840	8018840	Like, you were going to buy it anyways.
8018840	8020840	I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it.
8020840	8022840	Here in the studio.
8022840	8025840	I know, it's like old news, I'm thinking of that, I should have brought it yesterday.
8025840	8026840	It's alright.
8026840	8027840	Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse.
8027840	8028840	It's alright.
8028840	8029840	Just to remind you it's dead.
8029840	8031840	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.
8031840	8032840	Have a good one, buddy.
8032840	8033840	Bye.
8033840	8034840	Later.
8034840	8040840	Oh, it's some New York, it's New York night on the Skypline.
8040840	8041840	That was two New Yorkers in a row.
8041840	8042840	Yep.
8042840	8043840	I haven't been to New York in a while.
8043840	8044840	It's been at least a year.
8044840	8045840	It's time for me to go back.
8045840	8047840	It's been about 12 years for me.
8047840	8048840	You need to go.
8048840	8050840	We need to, we need to storm the big city.
8050840	8051840	Be fun.
8051840	8052840	Literally storm through it.
8052840	8055840	As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it.
8055840	8058840	We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there.
8058840	8059840	We'll see.
8059840	8060840	Someday.
8060840	8065840	If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
8065840	8068840	We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon.
8068840	8070840	But first, some more calls.
8070840	8071840	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8071840	8072840	Who's this?
8072840	8075840	It's GS68 and I just broke the streak of New York gamers.
8075840	8077840	You're not from New York.
8077840	8078840	No, what's up?
8078840	8083840	Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it.
8083840	8093840	One way to do that would be to lower game prices because these days, what typical gamer in the right mind would pay more than 25 or 50 cents to play an arcade game?
8093840	8096840	Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much.
8096840	8101840	But isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive?
8101840	8111840	I suppose. I mean, as much in... I hate to bring in Minnesota again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs.
8111840	8115840	I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know?
8115840	8120840	But then everybody would know it's a budget cab and people would go, oh, this one's lame. It's not as good as the other one.
8120840	8126840	You know what an awesome cab was? It was F-Zero AX. That was a brilliant cabinet. That was so fun.
8126840	8135840	Yeah, but look at time crisis for the majority of like the cab... time crisis for cabinets are small cabinets and people don't have a big problem with that.
8135840	8153840	Yeah. I don't know. Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom?
8153840	8163840	And then, what else? I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games like in the 70s and 80s.
8163840	8173840	Nowadays, it's the other way around. I mean, could you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that?
8173840	8181840	You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face. A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else. That would be something.
8181840	8186840	Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down. That'd be fun.
8186840	8197840	Well, some good arcadets going to the arcade is in itself a unique experience. I mean, at home you'd have to bring friends over to have a huge ass party.
8197840	8206840	And then there's online, but there's something about meeting your opponents in person that online doesn't have.
8206840	8212840	Hmm. I suppose. Alright. Uh, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go?
8212840	8213840	Um, no.
8213840	8217840	Alright. Have a good one, buddy, and good luck. I hope the arcades do come full circle someday.
8217840	8218840	Alright. Thank you.
8218840	8225840	Buh-bye. Because I miss arcades too, you know. 877-GameOLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We'll do one more call tonight.
8225840	8227840	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8227840	8229840	Hi, this is Akdeft.
8229840	8231840	Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind, buddy?
8231840	8242840	Oh, I have, uh, news here about, uh, a guy who marathoned, like, 26 hours and a half, uh, playing the drums on rock band.
8242840	8248840	He played rock band drums for 26 hours and- 26 and a half hours? Did his arm fall off?
8248840	8251840	Um, fortunately, not.
8251840	8253840	Wow, is he playing on hard mode?
8253840	8260840	He was playing on expert. Uh, he's actually a freak from the score hero forums. He's a staff member there.
8260840	8265840	Uh. What did- what was the point? Was it charity or what?
8265840	8280840	Just have fun, basically. He- he did, uh, something for charity, though. Uh, it wasn't that, um, how do you say it? Big? Because they- he only got to, like, $200.
8280840	8295840	Well, still, charity's charity. That's still pretty cool, though. Um, and speaking of charity and these marathon things, man, they're happening- thanks to sites like Justin.tv and Ustream and all these other sites, man, it seems like there's a gaming charity event happening every weekend somewhere.
8295840	8308840	In fact, I actually visited a website, and I'm sorry, I don't remember the URL, but I'm sure someone in chat will jump in there with it. There's actually a website out there somewhere, like, it's like gamemarathons.com or something, that show you, hey, these are all the marathons going on this weekend if you want to go watch people play some games.
8308840	8336840	Kind of interesting. I think it's more fun to play games, but then at the same time, I've always thought we here at OLR should do one of those for fun one time. Like, I think a fun game tournament that we- or not game tournament, game marathon we should do, is that- and I think this was kind of an idea we talked about kind of a little bit in circle on the show, is go to Jamie's, and in her big game archive, we'll pick games, and every hour, the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next, but they're, like, obscure shit. Like, no Mario, no Zelda.
8336840	8338840	What the hell do you think I have in the vault?
8338840	8344840	Exactly, we're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault, is what we would play all marathon long. Do you think people would be into that?
8344840	8346840	Yeah, that would be cool.
8346840	8350840	I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out.
8350840	8353840	I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you.
8353840	8367840	Yes, that too. But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off. We'll have to think about it. Maybe for- if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend, maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something, I don't know. Just throwing ideas out there. Some three day weekend, we'll have to see.
8367840	8396840	Basically, the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh cool, sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band.
8396840	8412840	And it makes me kind of pissed because even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure playing Expert, all the songs, even the download continent, so it's like-
8412840	8431840	I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and whatever website ran stories on this and whatever. My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror. You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills.
8431840	8445840	No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band. If you think you're any better than the guy playing rock band, guess what? You're worse. The end.
8445840	8461840	Indeed, I agree with that. There is no counter argument to that. You are worse than the guy playing rock band, which, you know what, if it makes him happy, I think he, play it for 48 hours next time. I support it.
8461840	8475840	He did say that he might try on December to do that again with all the download continent that is going to be released until then. So that would be cool.
8475840	8491840	Alright, act deft. Thank you so much for the call and party on with rock band. Take a good one. Have a good one, buddy. Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories. Dark Soccer by chance?
8491840	8506840	I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors? And apparently there's even video now. Apparently, you know how Darth Vader was supposed to be exclusive to PlayStation 3 Soul Calibur? Apparently not.
8506840	8521840	Apparently, he's actually showing up in videos now for the 360 version and vice versa. So, because you know people are breaking street on that and everything. So, kind of not a big surprise honestly, but it looks like Vader will be playable after all in 360 and vice versa for Yoda and the PS3.
8521840	8531840	Now you might have to pay for download content, but it's available. It's available. Loki, anything for you?
8531840	8545840	I don't think I have really much of anything. There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground. It kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious. Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake. So, that's kind of interesting.
8545840	8551840	Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2.
8551840	8553840	Talk about stunt casting.
8553840	8562840	Really, I just think they want some of the big tits on their cover. I support that fully. Let's see here.
8562840	8566840	Don't care.
8566840	8581840	Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st and what's kind of cool about it is it will have the character creator with it and you can actually share those characters that you create online and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September. So, that's kind of neat.
8581840	8591840	Let's see. Yeah, I think that's about it.
8591840	8601840	Amazeatsuma in chat has a good point. Says, Sky paid for download content. It's Namco so it will be paid to unlock content. It's old caliber. You're probably right.
8601840	8613840	BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader. I'll just pay $60. Okay, thanks. Well, I'll pay $60 and then maybe the $10 and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with.
8613840	8616840	Just messing.
8616840	8629840	Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun.
8629840	8639840	But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio. I will start tonight. And my final thought is I want a snack. I want snacky foods.
8639840	8649840	Yogurt. I want frozen yogurt. That would be really good. Oh my God, Rob. That's not really good. That's my final thought too. I want frozen yogurt. Let's go get some. We can't. They all close at nine.
8649840	8659840	Well, screw that. Let's go to the grocery store. I do need to go to the grocery store though. Loki, your final thought? I don't know. I don't have anything.
8659840	8670840	Alright. Wow. OLR PSP is still being worked on. I just have a lot of small things I haven't finished. But it is, I've been working on it quite heavily so soon.
8670840	8683840	Alright. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and downloading our podcast. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask if you enjoy the show, you hear. If you like what you're hearing, we are an independent podcast.
8683840	8697840	We do not have thousands of marketing dollars. In fact, we have zero dollars to work with. We don't have a big magazine backing us or a big gaming website or anything. We really struggle to connect with viewers like you.
8697840	8708840	So please tell two people you know about the show and slowly through word of mouth, Orange Lawns Radio will spread like a bad STD. But a lot nicer to have.
8708840	8715840	So anyway, thank you guys so much for listening to us. We'll see you next week with more of what you've come to love here on Orange Lawns Radio.
8715840	8727840	And again, if you are listening on the podcast, you want to leave some comments, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or leave us a voicemail which we still need to catch up on or post on our website at the forums at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
8727840	8746840	Until then, this is Rob, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we are Orange Lawns Radio. See you next week.
8757840	8766840	See you next week.
