14073	25134	Tonight, July 6th, 2008, a 16-bit RPG classic is being redone for the DS, Rock Band 2 leaks hit the internet, and could a popular racing game soon take on airplanes?
31618	35919	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35959	42301	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42381	43881	My name is Rob Roberts.
43941	47582	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47922	48262	Hi.
48822	49423	How are you, Jamie?
50483	50903	I don't know.
51462	52523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
75728	76569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
97935	98195	What's up?
98275	99376	I'm doing pretty good.
123019	123999	Alright, I gotta make sure.
124099	125500	Are we hearing Inter and Drew tonight?
125520	125720	I know.
125780	126700	Are we hearing Inter and Drew?
126840	127980	Yes, I think we are.
128240	129621	Barely, although that's very quiet.
129961	130341	I don't know.
130801	132101	Do I have the sensitive mic tonight?
132141	132441	Maybe I do.
132561	132861	I don't know.
133822	135202	Do I have the sensitive mic?
135222	135502	I don't know.
135522	135882	I don't know.
135942	136542	Maybe I do.
136782	137582	Live radio.
137663	139503	We're doing sound checks live on air.
139543	140263	Sound check one, two.
140643	141543	Alright, anyhow.
141603	143844	Look, when I talk, it makes little lines up here.
143864	144104	Exactly.
144124	145564	That's the magic of radio.
145584	146885	You haven't figured that out after six years?
147285	147525	Alright.
148545	155988	Also, say hello tonight to our website master, Dark Tetsuya is here in studio, amazing.
156188	158069	Yeah, I know, I made it.
158389	162191	You live in town and yet you never seem to make it over here, but here you are tonight.
162651	165432	Well, Drew said he was going to come and get me yesterday, so.
165893	166253	Awesome.
166613	166993	Here I am.
167193	171415	Alright, well Dark Tetsuya is here, we'll get him a little louder, we'll give him some mic lessons a little later.
172324	172624	DJ Ranma S
195865	197006	It's really bad tonight.
197807	201690	We may have to take a heat break in the middle of Part A. I'm serious.
201730	202150	It's sad.
202230	203772	Don't laugh at me, Rice Princess.
203812	204812	We'll have to get the Gatorade.
205033	207094	Seriously, it's pretty bad in here tonight.
207775	210097	I don't want Jamie to die live on air.
211177	212759	That would be horrific.
213099	214660	I don't want to die on air either.
215461	217843	So we might take a heat break in the middle of Part A. I want to die on bacon.
219604	220905	Alright, say hello as well.
221125	228771	The good news is, since we broadcast at 6 o'clock, you know, the heat reaches its peak around 5 o'clock, so it should be cooling off, thankfully, throughout the night.
229051	234194	Alright, say hello as well to, um, well, wait, I guess we're not in order of importance anymore, because she'd be on the bottom of the list.
234574	235535	Rice Princess!
236516	238597	Wait, aren't I on the bottom anyway?
238697	239778	Aren't I the last person?
240058	240398	I don't know.
240659	241359	I'm just messing with you.
241379	242280	Shut your face, Rob!
242360	242660	Alright.
243100	244481	How are you, Miss Princess?
244841	246022	Mad at you now.
246302	246923	No, you love me.
247383	248024	No, I don't.
248104	248344	Alright.
249505	251205	So we have a very full house tonight.
251346	253666	Just lots and lots of people to comment on the news tonight.
253966	258367	And of course, you in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
258888	260148	We've got lots of people in chat tonight.
260168	263989	We have Stickax282 who says, I'm kind of new here to this whole live thing.
264329	268490	Boy, did you pick a shitty show to have as your first show because it's going to be chaotic tonight.
269270	269731	But welcome.
270331	272231	Shadow Charlie says, Holy crap, it's Ranma.
273152	274312	Holy crap, indeed.
275276	275616	There it is.
275976	278698	Zappy says, somebody dying live on air sounds exciting.
278958	288643	You know, I think it's one of those things that's better when you're at home watching, but if you're like live in studio and considering the fact it's Jamie and it would kind of, like, I don't want Jamie to die.
289103	292945	I mean, Jamie said some things that have made me angry before, but I don't want her to die.
295047	298588	Heart.
298789	301130	I guess Jamie has died and the ferret has taken over tonight.
303347	306809	Jamie is alive and very well and wants to talk to you all about her gaming week.
306849	308810	How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
309250	310250	I played Black Knight 2000.
311431	314413	It's imbalanced, but I managed to replay on my first ball.
314533	316794	That's the only time I've ever done well on that game in my life.
319807	322930	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
345527	349849	No Fear, and World Cup Soccer in the house and everything else that's outside.
350129	352371	Dan's working on our friend's Indiana Jones machine.
352391	355732	Yeah, I was going to say, when I was there, I saw an Indiana Jones machine that was being worked on.
355752	356973	But we used it for cookies.
356993	359774	Yes, I actually ate a cookie off the Indiana Jones machine.
359794	360475	It was pretty awesome.
361815	362916	It was very delicious.
362956	363796	They were mint cookies.
364177	365317	Yes, it was very delicious.
365757	366618	Orange Lounge Foodio.
368739	369059	All right.
369419	370820	Anything else that you played with your week?
371820	372481	Any de-essin'?
373132	376534	I played Traffic a lot, and I played Getting Lost to San Francisco.
376594	377555	You played in Traffic?
378776	379536	I played Driving.
379776	383339	A lot of people tell me to go play in Traffic, but I've never actually played in Traffic.
383359	384900	I played Initial D for real.
386120	387281	No, it was on the freeways.
387361	388482	It was more like Wan Gun.
389523	389823	Awesome.
391124	391404	Awesome.
392062	394423	All right, let's go around the studio and see what everybody else has been playing.
394503	395863	I will start with the guests tonight.
396363	396863	I'll be nice.
397464	398724	And Loki and I will go last.
398744	400164	Who has the mic for you kids over there?
401125	404105	Rice Princess, since you were on the bottom last time, why don't you start off?
404125	404826	How was your gaming week?
405226	406066	Non-existent.
406186	406526	Next.
407126	407846	Wow, you're boring.
408207	409407	All right, Ranma, how was your gaming week?
409850	410650	It was tolerable.
410910	423213	I played Mario Kart DS on the plane ride coming in and throughout the week on the subway, I was playing Custom Robo Arena, which has really become one of my favorite games.
425174	425514	Interesting.
427294	428995	Tell us a little bit about Custom Robo Arena.
429035	429835	I don't think I've ever heard of it.
430375	434396	Basically, Custom Robo Arena is like a Pokemon-ish type game where...
435390	439474	You get like this little cube as a robot and you customize it with different parts and you battle with it.
439915	446762	And the fun part of the stylus is like cleaning up your robot because throughout the game, if you're running around with a dirty robo, nobody wants to fight with you.
446862	449725	It's like a Tamagotchi where it'll poop randomly and you have to clean it up.
450866	451887	Sounds awesome.
452668	453368	Sounds very awesome.
453609	454430	Not bad for $9.99, so hey.
454470	455190	There you go.
455491	455851	There you go.
457652	458693	And we'll put it out.
487102	487402	Awesome.
487943	491025	I want to apologize for the audio quality you've been hearing in the first little bits of the show, too.
491085	496670	I think the mics got switched, and the guests got the mic with a very low gain, and I got the one with a very high gain.
496690	500473	So I was very loud, and they were very quiet, but we've switched some things over here on the board.
501133	505456	I ninja'd over to the board and switched some things while they were talking about their gaming week, so hopefully it's getting a little better.
506097	507158	We'll see you as we move on.
507218	508979	And DarkTetsuya, how was your gaming week?
508999	509700	What have you been playing?
510320	512041	Oh, just a lot of Need for Speed Carbon.
512061	517744	I actually beat it, but I went back and did some of the challenges to unlock some more stuff.
520085	523287	Now, don't you have a Justin.TV channel or something where people can actually watch you play games?
523587	526409	Yeah, I stream random emulators and stuff.
527389	530151	What kind of games can people see if they check you out on Justin.TV?
530451	532192	Well, I'm working on Zelda right now.
532232	534573	I'm waiting to do Death Mountain.
535603	535883	Nice.
536483	542005	You know, I was actually on Justin.TV very randomly one night, and you might not know what Dark Tits are, but I was watching you.
542045	546827	That's the thing about Justin.TV is you can actually watch people and they never know.
546847	550508	You were playing La Mulana, and that was actually the first time I'd ever seen it, so it was cool.
551536	552576	I actually got to check that out.
552957	554877	It does look very retro.
554917	556438	I can see why people are really into that game.
557018	557398	Very cool.
558339	558639	All right.
558719	560980	And you do not host your own podcast right now, right?
561140	562000	No, not at the moment.
562020	562480	Not at the moment.
562520	563420	All right.
563701	564081	Drew.
564941	567062	Intern Drew, do you host a podcast, for heaven's sake?
568162	568962	Not yet, no.
569463	570263	Oh, shit.
570283	571423	You got plans for one, don't you?
571683	571884	No.
572544	575505	Any asshole with a mic can do a podcast in this day and age.
575925	576966	I don't know how to describe it.
576986	578326	It's a platformer action game with RPG elements.
578346	579667	That, I've been playing some Fire Emblem 7.
579707	580228	Trying to actually beat it.
604361	607263	Which is brutal, even on the first try.
608384	611566	And aside from that, I haven't been playing much.
612667	613668	Weren't you Captain Excitement?
613768	622034	I picked up Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 at Used Bookstore the other day.
622674	623655	I can't get it to run.
623895	624515	It crashes.
626717	627898	Best ten bucks I ever spent.
628318	629239	Thank you, Ubisoft.
629419	630300	Now make your games work.
632061	632241	Nice.
634153	634494	All right.
635014	637778	I guess that's going to... He's putting his mic down somewhat angrily.
637878	639820	So, Loki, how was your gaming week?
639940	640501	What did you play?
641001	642623	I'm trying to figure out which mic I'm supposed to be having here.
642643	643244	I think you're that one.
644025	644306	All right.
645347	648130	I didn't play too much this week because I've been busy.
649091	650733	And I did play...
651759	652679	Grand Theft Auto 4 Defender Castle
673525	676006	and Mario Kart Wii.
676286	677986	We had to download a ton more Miis.
678506	682747	In fact, we got one that's got a crab on the person's face, which is kind of funny.
683447	684407	It pinches its claws.
686147	686808	Crab people!
687088	687828	Yes, crab people.
688288	690828	And then one with Mickey Mouse.
691368	694469	We just downloaded a bunch of Miis and played the levels with the Miis in the background.
694489	694989	That was funny.
696609	699010	And I just tried the...
700350	701711	Homebrew, Smash Bros.
701751	704272	game that someone had made or worked on.
704932	709175	And I guess it's very early because it's not very good right now.
709355	711216	But, I mean, it's not... Needs work?
711476	714517	It's not even close to being started, let alone done.
714617	715918	So, yeah.
718199	719000	So that was it for your week.
719020	720961	You had a pretty slow gaming week, all things considered.
720981	722481	But you got other projects going on, right?
722822	723582	Yeah, I'm busy.
723622	725243	Then my car was in the shop.
725583	726323	Oh, fun.
726704	726884	Yeah.
727264	727704	Fun, fun.
728064	729045	You've had an exciting week.
729775	734216	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
757922	760004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
781118	782119	Dan really loves Aerosmith.
804281	805463	So then it's worth it to Dan.
805524	806425	But we didn't buy it.
806545	808810	Me, Guitar Hero Journey, I would have dropped the $60.
808910	811414	I would have paid $100 for Guitar Hero Journey.
811755	812857	But it's not Guitar Hero Journey.
812897	813859	It's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
815604	818747	But it did motivate me to go back and actually play some Guitar Hero 3.
819728	822571	And I still cannot beat that freaking Slipknot song on hard.
822591	824873	Did you download the free song?
825153	825554	I did.
825634	827256	The Top Gun song is awesome.
827576	833943	I wish it was Danger Zone, but... Still, what a great patriotic tune.
835638	837901	Yeah, the last thing we need is homoerotic volleyball scenes.
849456	850137	www.DarkSakura.com
867475	868195	Thank you for watching!
894947	902128	Like, that's the part I'm having trouble kind of getting over because I want to strum everything and it's hard to tell when the notes are coming that fast which ones you have to strum and which ones you don't.
902368	904969	Does Guitar Hero people in chat know what I'm talking about, please?
905009	905949	Or do I just sound crazy?
906349	906689	I don't know.
906849	908749	Because everybody in the studio is looking at me like, huh?
909009	910850	Yeah, like the hammer-ons and stuff.
910910	911350	Exactly.
911590	913470	And the tutorial does not explain it that well.
913510	919311	The tutorial explains a little bit about the, how you can, like, I'm not even going to try to explain it.
919331	920991	The tutorial doesn't explain it very well.
921051	922672	It's kind of something I had to learn on my own.
923152	923712	So there you have it.
924781	926042	Before we begin, I have presents.
943956	944536	Presence?
944596	946377	What a good way to start tonight's housekeeping.
947017	948918	I love housekeeping to begin with presents.
949198	959361	First off, before the show, I was showing the people on JustinTV this, but Loki got me some new floor mats with Hello Kitty on them, which is hilarious because I already had ones with penguins on them, so I'm going to figure out how to use them both.
960580	962502	DarkSakura, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
974892	977313	I don't want to lie on a shirt.
1001448	1002810	You guys didn't plan that, did you?
1002950	1004111	You have no choice.
1004732	1005213	Well, that's great.
1005233	1006354	Thank you so much for the shirts.
1006694	1007776	Wow, that's great.
1008196	1011780	I'll change into one right now, but not live on cam, because that's kind of gross.
1012882	1013202	Thank you.
1014864	1015104	Excellent.
1015144	1016386	I do heart NY.
1016506	1017487	I can't wait to go back.
1019269	1019650	Excellent.
1021324	1024427	Hey, hey, hey, I'm wearing my shirt that says Ice Skull Pirates.
1042481	1043522	Oh my god, she is!
1043542	1043863	No comment!
1043883	1044303	What is that?
1044323	1044523	Alright.
1062461	1063721	All right, housekeeping.
1064842	1065142	What else?
1065182	1066522	I don't really have anything for the show.
1066542	1069263	We have no interviews coming up, which is kind of sad, but I will say this.
1069343	1071864	We always have our LiveJournal community and the MySpace communities.
1072424	1073025	And Facebook.
1073145	1077086	Facebook, we are the OLRMY, O-L-R-M-Y, if you want to look us up.
1077426	1079787	If you want to join us on LiveJournal, Orange Lounge.
1079907	1082208	No radio, just Orange Lounge is us on LiveJournal.
1082448	1084289	And on MySpace, we are Orange Lounge Radio.
1084609	1087390	Three different names for three different sites, if we could be any more confusing.
1087770	1089610	Good job, Standards Department.
1089630	1091191	Don't confuse us with the group Orange Range.
1092481	1095284	Or the group Orange Lounge, for that matter.
1095344	1098987	Although, has Tomosuke made an Orange Lounge song in the past three years?
1099027	1099668	I don't think he has.
1100048	1100309	Has he?
1100929	1101029	No.
1101910	1103011	So we own it now, I think.
1103051	1104933	I think there's some rule now that we own Orange Lounge.
1105334	1106335	Alright, just kidding.
1106735	1108797	Alright, let's get to tonight's gaming news.
1109257	1110699	And Loki's going to start us off tonight.
1111052	1113455	Yeah, so more details about Mega Man 9.
1113655	1118560	It is going to be completely 8-bit looking, including the very limited color palette as well.
1119281	1123666	It's supposed to be also really fucking hard, just like most Mega Man games.
1124287	1129853	In fact, there was some hands-on stuff from Joystick and some other...
1131733	1132214	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1156634	1172559	I forgot to mention about my gaming week I've been playing Mega Man Anniversary Collection and I'm starting with Mega Man 1 I'm about to pull my fucking hair out on the Iceman level with those fucking blocks Whoever invented the block puzzles needs to burn in hell
1172779	1180144	All right, once you get past the blocks, once you get past the blocks... Then it only gets worse in Mega Man 2 and the Heat Man stage, unless you have Item 2.
1180244	1182205	Unless you have Item 2, which you ought to.
1182365	1182786	Yeah, I know.
1183086	1190891	But seriously, until about the fifth game, the fifth NES game, I never thought Mega Man series was really that hard.
1191131	1195014	Rob, if you want to make everything easy on the first Mega Man, start with Cut Man.
1195614	1195874	I did.
1196355	1199096	I have killed Cut Man, Elect Man, Guts Man, Bomb Man.
1199136	1201338	I'm just... I got to get Ice Man now so I can get Fire Man.
1202267	1204208	GameGuru says Nintendo games should be Nintendo hard.
1230720	1233262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1253885	1254425	They're okay.
1254725	1257426	No, I like the Nintendo Mega Man.
1257446	1259907	So this old school thing made you squee in many places, right?
1259927	1260267	Yes, it did.
1261208	1261588	Good to hear.
1261828	1264729	I think they should just continue with making Mega Man games just like this.
1264769	1273933	Just make them all a bit from now on and if you want to do the 16-bit or the little higher graphics games, just do the Mega Man X series.
1274493	1276334	They have really too many series going on.
1276354	1281916	They have that ZX series now and then they also have Star Force and just...
1283041	1284001	Bring back Legends.
1284221	1286082	Bring back the original 8-bit Mega Man.
1286322	1286822	Well, they are.
1287162	1288243	You're getting half of what you want.
1288363	1290143	Okay, but they need to continue.
1290803	1292064	One game is not bringing it back.
1293204	1295164	I've got to read some comments as well from JustinTV.
1295204	1297405	We have more people on JustinTV than I've ever seen before.
1297425	1298125	This is crazy.
1298886	1302226	Illustrator says, Real fucking hard keeps the ignorant noobs away.
1302286	1305027	But Mega Man 9 is not really a multiplayer game, so who cares about noobs?
1305307	1307308	Let a noob noob themselves in a...
1307728	1308609	That's the point.
1308629	1313151	It's supposed to be fucking hard, and then you keep playing it until you can pass it, and then you become better.
1314032	1317073	You don't just go, oh, I suck, move on to the next game.
1318054	1323077	As it was said before about leading noobs to water, most of what you get are wet noobs.
1323377	1325198	And now you're leading noobs to Splash Woman.
1325778	1326039	Yes.
1326399	1331962	I think she's going to be a bit wet.
1332182	1332863	Oh, you're disgusting.
1334761	1336402	Maybe that's a little tagline on the poster.
1336922	1339703	This September, Splash Woman gets wet.
1339883	1340823	Are we explicit yet?
1341624	1342504	We always are.
1343465	1343765	Fuck!
1344045	1344405	Now we are.
1345926	1346286	Thank you.
1346646	1347866	No, not necessarily.
1347906	1352628	You have to say it a few more times because I watched... Fuck, fuck, fuckity, fucker, fucker, fuck, fuck, fuck.
1352668	1353148	There you go.
1353168	1357270	Because I watched Hancock over the weekend and they did have fuck in there once, but it's still PG-13.
1357310	1359151	But it's got cock in the title!
1360658	1362439	Every movie should have cock in the title.
1362479	1363540	His name's John Hancock.
1363560	1365161	Is that the fuck show already?
1365341	1366602	Orange Lounge Cockio.
1366662	1367743	No, it's the cock show!
1370285	1370645	Alright.
1372006	1372386	Anyway.
1373527	1376148	So Mega Man 9's been dated for September as well, right?
1377830	1379070	Yes, that's what I already said.
1379531	1380131	Sorry, I missed it.
1380151	1380691	I was sleeping.
1380751	1382873	I was thinking about Splash Woman's cock.
1383533	1383573	Um...
1387343	1390524	because you know she probably had one at some point.
1391144	1393045	Dr. Wily has his leftover parts.
1393225	1394405	Anyhow!
1394745	1399707	What is it with Wily and making every single one of his robots male?
1400667	1401748	You think he's got a little secret?
1401948	1402908	Now he's branching out.
1404432	1405553	Is it sexist, DarkSakura?
1405593	1406773	Oh my god, he's bi.
1407153	1407934	Is it sexist?
1408634	1417337	No, because see, Dr. Wily likes little boys, but that's okay because so does Dr. Light, and Dr. Light also likes little girls.
1418154	1419595	What the hell is wrong with this show?
1419615	1423098	For real, I'm clicking unsubscribe right now.
1423218	1423518	Click.
1423938	1425420	That was disgusting.
1425540	1427561	So you're saying Dr. Wally's a member of the Catholic Church?
1427581	1429423	God, Chris Hansen's gonna be here any minute.
1429603	1431004	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1431064	1431865	Take a seat.
1431885	1432485	Take a seat.
1432725	1433886	Ah, shit, you already took a seat.
1434887	1436568	Because I don't think there's any altar girls.
1439450	1441352	So he's probably Presbyterian.
1441812	1442313	Alright, look.
1446295	1450376	Let's go to a much cleaner, safer, kid-friendly game.
1451637	1452577	Animal Crossing.
1452837	1453738	Animal Crossing.
1455138	1461020	There has been a teaser in the latest official Nintendo magazine over in the UK.
1461581	1468183	And if you look at the magazine scan that's floating around the internet, or if you're actually on the magazine, it says, it's been a while.
1468383	1470444	It's time to revisit an old friend.
1470584	1472565	How's your village doing these days?
1473365	1477426	That is... It just has a little picture from Animal Crossing and has that quote.
1477706	1479547	Could that be a hint that we get Animal Crossing 83?
1479947	1481027	I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet.
1481447	1481627	What?
1481927	1482488	I have a thought.
1483188	1485248	It's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions.
1486949	1489009	The Wii one's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions?
1489049	1489189	Why?
1489229	1491470	I think it's going to make you load your GameCube Village.
1492718	1495439	Oh, maybe that's why the quote saying, how's your village doing all these days?
1495479	1498760	In other words, you better go pull some fucking weeds or you're in for it when the new game comes out.
1498900	1502281	It means I better go get my memory card back from my friend who was taking care of my village for me.
1502541	1503261	It wasn't me, was it?
1503461	1503661	No.
1503681	1503821	Oh, good.
1503841	1509723	You know what would be funny is the reason they're saying that they're all, yeah, you should really go back and check how your village is doing because you're not getting a new game.
1509923	1511184	You better go back and play the old one.
1511944	1512804	That might be the joke.
1513044	1513504	Rob.
1513744	1513984	What?
1514104	1515385	I've got the Japanese one, too.
1516095	1517215	I got a new memory card.
1517295	1518436	I lost my old village.
1518496	1519116	I can't find it.
1519156	1526458	But I have a new memory card, so I'm thinking about making, like, OLR Town and maybe playing it on Justin.TV and letting the chatters... You should do that, Rob.
1526658	1528299	Yeah, let the chatters name stuff.
1528319	1528879	For real.
1528979	1529359	We'll do that.
1529579	1532660	Because we have to have... Who was the lesbian?
1534076	1534656	I don't remember.
1534676	1535237	She lives in my village.
1535257	1536738	There was a lesbian that lived in the village.
1536758	1538539	Yes, I remember.
1538659	1539760	Her whole house was a gym.
1541321	1544723	And she was our resident lesbian, so we put a nice little rainbow sign up in front of her house.
1544743	1546204	Yes, we put a gay pride flag in front of her house.
1546324	1547044	And then she moved.
1547344	1547565	Yes.
1547825	1551267	So we started putting the pattern up in every town we visited.
1551607	1554729	Didn't we have her saying, like, I like boobs as a little thing?
1555009	1555350	Yeah.
1555590	1556630	Animal Crossing is so awesome.
1556650	1558992	Of course, we also had someone running around going, cock.
1561255	1566579	SSJ100Matt says the question is if Rob and Irene will quit WoW to play Animal Crossing Wii Yes!
1568340	1572823	RicePrincess says she already has Are you getting a head start in a new village?
1573003	1588093	Only if they'll batten you all It is a 12 step recovery program Alright, it is a 12 step recovery program We'll see, E3 is coming very soon I have my fingers and toes and other parts crossed that Animal Crossing will be an announcement at E3, so we'll see
1589440	1590080	We shall see.
1590120	1591701	Let's move on with other news here.
1592101	1594642	Wait, actually, I'll read quick chat comments here.
1594702	1597343	Sharon says, Animal Crossing was only somewhat kid-friendly.
1597683	1599583	It taught you to not take loans from anyone.
1599904	1604685	If you do, you'll have to do bitch work for your neighbors and take all the furniture they throw away for the rest of your life.
1605445	1605665	Nice.
1606486	1606846	Very nice.
1608486	1608987	More news.
1609927	1610347	Gotta.
1610947	1611267	Gotta.
1612908	1613108	Okay.
1613528	1614208	Hey, guess what?
1615049	1615549	Chicken butt.
1616229	1618670	There's... Guess why?
1619315	1621756	Chicken Thigh, In Your Eye.
1621776	1625237	This is totally one of those shows.
1625477	1625857	You know what?
1625917	1629459	Having people in studio, like a live audience practically, ruins this show.
1630059	1633740	But Rob, for my story, you need to do something.
1633980	1635061	Okay, what do I have to do for your story?
1635081	1641743	You need to pull up the said site that this refers to from Squeenix and play the sound effect and see if anyone in the chatroom gets it first.
1642778	1645601	I have a feeling everybody in chat already knows what's coming.
1645621	1646882	But I want the sound effect.
1647683	1648323	Yes, ma'am.
1648583	1650945	Orange Lounge Radio is fucked up in front of a live audience.
1650965	1653207	What a demanding woman tonight.
1653628	1655749	Let's see, I've got to get there.
1657191	1657511	Here we go.
1659298	1659818	Oh, wait, that's not it.
1659838	1660198	That's not me.
1660218	1661939	You're going to have to start reading the story.
1661979	1662640	I can't find it.
1662900	1668723	There's a particular game that I'm sure a lot of people have been wanting for quite a while.
1669083	1671164	And by the way, it's the link that says Japanese website, by the way.
1673305	1673825	Wait, wait, wait.
1674046	1681189	Are they bringing back to some sort of system their Super Metroid?
1681209	1682210	Because that game is awesome.
1682370	1682490	No.
1684511	1686152	They're bringing back an RPG.
1686752	1692374	It is speculated to be a port, hopefully remaining in 2D, on the Nintendo DS.
1693455	1694935	Is it in Fury or Super Metroid?
1697076	1697496	Shut up.
1699177	1699897	I see what you did there.
1699917	1701238	It's not at all.
1701858	1705459	But do the viewers, do the listeners... I'm going to throw something at you, okay?
1705600	1706080	Please do.
1706620	1708601	Anyway, Chrono Trigger.
1709787	1721314	If you go to ScreenX's site, the address is square-nx.co.jp slash ctds.
1723775	1726577	And as Rob is pulling it up now.
1727077	1728879	It's kind of slow because we're broadcasting.
1728939	1730019	Yeah, there you go.
1730139	1730560	There we go.
1732381	1733341	You're going to hear the effect.
1734262	1735362	I don't even know if they're going to hear it.
1735723	1737544	We got so much shit running in studio tonight.
1738152	1750833	at any rate, well if you go to that site you will see the clock and you will hear the ticking and you will know that it's Chrono Trigger because no other game freaking has that clock making that same ticking noise at the very start of it
1752349	1757314	Yeah, my computer is not enjoying broadcasting an internet radio show and doing the Chrono Trigger website at the same time.
1757354	1762920	We will let you do that for yourself so that you can have a truly interactive experience, those of you listening to the podcast.
1763420	1768105	Alpha Cananogram says in chat, DarkSakura, now it's chronotrigger.jp as well.
1768966	1769266	Is it?
1770147	1770527	Rad.
1770988	1772669	Don't make it 3D, Squeenix.
1772689	1773330	Don't fuck it up.
1773723	1775725	Shaoran says Chrono Trigger, it's over.
1775805	1779348	Seriously, guys, there are other RPGs that have better storylines and better character development.
1779868	1780188	No!
1780448	1781029	Oh, snap.
1781329	1784632	You did not, okay?
1784752	1785452	I think he did.
1786173	1788375	And they haven't translated the ones that do surpass it.
1791657	1794760	Here's the thing, I heard that the Chrono Trigger... What, Loki, what?
1796081	1796321	Nothing.
1797202	1797482	I'm good.
1798223	1800265	I just wanted to say about Chrono Trigger, it's not 3D.
1800285	1801987	Don't we already know it's going to be the same old sprites?
1802007	1802748	Yes, exactly.
1802808	1803749	They did nothing.
1804730	1806072	That we can tell, at least.
1806112	1808274	Bonus dungeon, Wi-Fi play.
1808414	1810537	Maybe add some bonus dungeons.
1811758	1814721	I heard co-op, but how can you play co-op in that game?
1814762	1815783	Because you have three people.
1815883	1816784	It would be like Secret of Mana.
1819158	1819659	Secret of Mana
1830919	1831639	And that was fun.
1831819	1832539	That was a lot of fun.
1832559	1834160	I've got a multitap, so that was a lot of fun.
1834200	1835440	Good times.
1835960	1859904	But the other speculation, and actually I hope that this will be included, is that the animated scenes that they did for the PlayStation version are rumored to be making it to the DS version, especially if they're spending less of the processing power on the way the game runs and putting more of it into having the cinemas, because that'll make it sweet.
1861130	1861771	More endings!
1862271	1864834	SSJ100Mad asks, co-op gato battle.
1866035	1867076	Ooh, sweet.
1867857	1872000	So I want to know, everyone who's in this room that's played Chrono Trigger, how many endings have you gotten?
1873322	1873582	Two.
1873982	1874923	Hell, if I remember.
1875003	1875724	Probably four.
1875964	1876345	All of them.
1877566	1878747	You have no time on your hands, sir.
1879868	1881049	I mean, you have too much time.
1883511	1885313	What was the secret one where you go watch the...
1886778	1886998	Oh yeah.
1887018	1887098	Hmm.
1905029	1905750	And I've done that one.
1905770	1914496	That's the one where you get the developers ending where you actually have representations of the developers and you go into the last room and it's Toriyama wearing his gas mask and everything.
1914516	1918939	And the credits go by really, really fast because they want you to skip past it again.
1919659	1921460	All this freaking reminiscing here in studio.
1921481	1924623	Loki looks like he's about to explode wanting to talk about Elebits.
1924823	1925683	No, I don't really care.
1925703	1933089	I didn't play really much of Chrono Trigger and I don't feel bad for not having played Chrono Trigger either, so...
1934598	1938387	If I wanna play Chrono Trigger, I'll hook up my Super Nintendo and grab my cartridge.
1939765	1941246	I think the DS one might be kind of cool.
1941966	1943267	I didn't play Final Fantasy 6.
1943647	1949132	Seeing as getting a Chrono Trigger Super Nintendo cartridge at this time, if you didn't hang on to one, it's going to cost you a lot of money to get one now.
1949152	1955156	I hear this game is going to have this super secret final ending where you take the game back to GameStop and trade it in for store credit.
1956637	1956918	Rob.
1956938	1957258	What?
1957878	1958899	I didn't pay for my copy.
1960220	1961721	Someone gave it to me and he moved.
1962762	1963503	So I have it in the box.
1963543	1964183	Nice, inherited.
1964223	1966985	I don't plan on paying for my copy either.
1967025	1967946	What a coincidence.
1967966	1968226	I know.
1969187	1969947	All right, move on.
1970167	1970708	More stories.
1970888	1971928	Less exciting news.
1971988	1977951	Elebits 2 has been confirmed, and it's not the same Elebits you may have remembered.
1978071	1984294	Now it's some sort of top-down, sprite-based game, and there's lots of Elebits running around.
1984354	1988175	It's almost like a cartoony version of Pikmin or something like that.
1989436	1989756	I don't know.
1989816	1992957	But Elebits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero is coming out this fall.
1994558	1994978	I don't know.
1995779	1996319	It looks weird.
1997967	2004374	Do you think maybe they're just like, you know, the Wii one just didn't work like we wanted it to, so let's just jump ship and go to the DS.
2004414	2007698	They probably tried to do a 3D version on the DS and were like, wow, that sucks.
2007878	2011482	And then they're just like, okay, let's see what we can do with the touchscreen.
2013345	2013865	I don't know.
2013885	2018851	There's no way they could have done a 3D version on the DS anyways, because there's no depth in it.
2019437	2021998	True, true.
2022198	2024599	There's not a lot of depth in a lot of DS games, actually.
2024699	2027019	It looks like Pokemon.
2027039	2031441	Well, Pokemon sells billions and billions of copies, so it probably is not a bad idea.
2032321	2032781	There you have it.
2033902	2038303	Coming to the Wii, however, even if Elebits 2 may not be coming to the Wii, apparently Cooking Mama...
2038823	2054791	there's going to be another Cooking Mama game on the Wii it's Cooking Mama World Kitchen and it's coming to you from Majesco and it's a follow up to the game Cooking Mama Cook Off which was kind of crap because they tried to port a DS game to the Wii and it just didn't work very well sadly
2055151	2056292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2079079	2079920	I'm betting on the second.
2080441	2082603	I really hope not because Cookie Mama's kind of cool.
2082903	2085646	I don't know, Jamie, I know you love Cookie Mama very much.
2085706	2087929	What do you think about a rhythm-based Cookie Mama game on the Wii?
2088049	2089691	I'll reserve judgment until I actually try it.
2091232	2092133	That's all I say.
2092313	2094816	I know, and I feel the same way, but your heart doesn't like, you know.
2095717	2099381	I'm completely apathetic towards it right now.
2099782	2100102	All right.
2100652	2101192	I will play it.
2101572	2102192	I'm interested.
2102593	2105053	But I'm not going to make my judgment until I actually see it.
2105073	2111235	Because, honestly, I've had games where I've made a harsh judgment about them to start.
2111555	2112975	And it's turned out that they've been pretty fun.
2113776	2116156	So I'm not going to... Like Imagine Babies?
2117156	2117657	Hell no!
2117697	2118517	That game sucks!
2119357	2122758	That game is like the bugs that live in shit.
2124515	2125035	Let's see.
2126315	2127856	Where did we have in the chat room?
2128196	2132156	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.
2132957	2134377	That might be Cooking Mama.
2134397	2137597	Frisbee says, Cooking Mama, Hell's Kitchen.
2138177	2141738	Now that might be a little bit fun if somebody screams at Cooking Mama and makes her cry.
2142518	2146099	Except if they based it off of a show, it should be based off of a good show.
2146359	2152000	Well, Hell's Kitchen is already getting a DS game and it's actually coming out before Cooking Mama.
2152580	2153080	Interesting.
2154059	2155420	I don't know if that's going to be any good though.
2155760	2156741	Alright, well there you have it.
2159002	2160843	So we'll see about that Cooking Mommy game.
2161183	2164726	I don't know, I have to admit it makes me a little bit nervous, but we'll see.
2166167	2166967	We shall.
2167908	2177113	Well, for more happy wee news, this might make some people very pleased, but there is a...
2178536	2181537	A little bit more coming out for WiiWare.
2182497	2184317	It was actually released on Friday.
2187538	2194719	First is Pokemon Ranch, where, to quote, it's a place where Pokemon and people love living together.
2197079	2197319	Yeah.
2197759	2198159	Anyway.
2198179	2199980	They need Pokemon Bunny Ranch.
2200980	2201160	No.
2201720	2202840	Or Pokemon Sniper.
2202860	2207061	No, it's Jigglypimp's Whore Lounge from Kalec in the House.
2207751	2209172	Slut Bunny Slut Bunny
2235689	2238010	Shaoran in chat wants to know if you can brand them.
2238751	2239711	That would be awesome.
2244494	2245655	Pokemon Snap 2.
2245755	2246956	This time you have a gun.
2249057	2250578	A whole new kind of rail shooter.
2250678	2252599	Pokemon Snap their necks.
2255400	2257041	Cheeseburger says Imagine Sniper.
2258362	2259543	I would play Imagine Sniper.
2260899	2263341	That'd be like Silent Scope, though.
2264642	2266924	But it's going to be 1,000 Wii points.
2268185	2271748	And the other one is a game that you pop bubbles on.
2272809	2274711	The bubble popping game is finally coming out.
2276172	2277213	What a clever title.
2277293	2278094	You just pop bubbles.
2278414	2279635	Is it like Buster Brothers?
2280576	2287202	No, I think it's supposed to be more like... It's a bubble wraps game.
2288320	2290389	I played with that the other day!
2291153	2292459	It was called Bubble Wrap!
2293684	2296305	It was called Going to Seize Candy and the best part is the bubble wrap.
2296365	2296965	No, no, no.
2297025	2298846	It was called I Bought a Teapot and Played the Bubble Wrap.
2299066	2299786	Here's my question.
2300426	2303647	If you feed a Pokemon an Alka-Seltzer, will it explode?
2304147	2304888	That's what I want to know.
2305908	2307088	Only the avian ones will.
2308429	2309249	Well, that's some of them.
2309529	2310129	There's birds.
2310390	2312190	Pikachu giblets everywhere.
2312310	2315231	Rice Princess has this horrified look on her face.
2315491	2316792	Would you play Pokemon Ranch?
2316852	2317872	Does it sound like a fun game to you?
2319113	2319273	No.
2321135	2322916	But Rob... Why?
2323296	2324397	It's 700 Wii Points.
2325438	2326139	To pop bubbles.
2326219	2327099	This is awesome, though.
2327119	2330502	Nintendo and WiiWare, they're really doing some different things.
2331303	2334325	People want a new Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game.
2334585	2337347	You get Crystal Chronicles, My Life as the King.
2337367	2339109	It's not really a Crystal Chronicles game.
2339149	2344293	It's more of like other people are having fun outside of your city and you're just staying home watching TV.
2344833	2345574	That's kind of what it is.
2345614	2347155	Whereas Pokemon Ranch...
2347794	2351478	I feel an OLR game somewhere in here called, like, Goddamn I'm So Bored.
2370405	2371686	We play it every Sunday.
2372387	2375690	That's like the Me Parade.
2377111	2384397	In God Damn I'm So Bored, you start a podcast with your two friends, and then you just sit there and pop bubble wrap the whole time.
2384558	2384958	I don't know.
2384998	2386619	There's a game to be made here somewhere.
2386639	2387320	I've got to think about it.
2387340	2393866	You also have to include turning on your Wii for the first time and trying to watch Me March with only one me on it.
2395526	2397007	That's goddamn, I'm so lonely.
2417110	2417690	Magnetica Magnetica
2442082	2454443	Magnetica, and then they have Toki Tori, which is just lame, and the bubble popping game, which, I don't know, it's all kind of lame.
2456536	2456776	Oh well.
2458637	2460518	Something else that hopefully is not lame.
2460898	2462159	Castlevania Judgment.
2462259	2468443	The kind of, not really a Castlevania game, but now it's Soul Castlevania.
2468903	2471884	You know, Soul Calibur, but Castlevania characters and that kind of thing.
2473125	2476367	It will have Wii DS connectivity.
2476387	2481390	You'll be able to plug in your new Order of Es... What was it?
2481470	2481530	Uh...
2482441	2488764	Ecclesia, the new DS platformer game coming out to unlock bonus gameplay content.
2489444	2492046	And also so Konami can say, we sold you one of each.
2492966	2493426	Sucker.
2494287	2495047	Let me guess, let me guess.
2495167	2502211	I'm thinking a character that you only see in the DS game is going to be playable in the Wii game if you connect them.
2503462	2505506	What do you think?
2505526	2506067	And guess what?
2506268	2512780	It's probably paid to unlock content because you're paying for the DS game to unlock the content on the disc that was already there.
2513702	2514524	Wouldn't surprise me at all.
2516340	2517641	But here's what you need to do.
2517741	2522243	You get a friend that has this game for the DS and you just have him come over and done.
2522504	2523544	No purchase necessary.
2523564	2524004	There you go.
2526986	2527286	Alright.
2528107	2534270	Well, Loki was talking about this a little bit earlier during his gaming week, but if you haven't heard yet, there is a homebrew Super Smash Bros.
2534370	2536291	Rumble that's available on the DS.
2537332	2540614	It's by a homebrew programmer that goes by the name of Fuzzy.
2541834	2543295	If you touch him, do you get dizzy?
2543475	2544216	That's what I want to know.
2545865	2546505	Bad joke there.
2546625	2552188	Anyhow, apparently, though, the game only has three levels in it right now, and just one character is playable in the game.
2552228	2552768	It's Mario.
2553148	2554589	Now, I have not actually played the game.
2554609	2558671	There's YouTube-age of it, but Loki, since you've actually played the game, tell us a little more about it.
2558891	2560092	It's very simplified.
2560112	2562973	I mean, it's sprite-based characters, obviously.
2563013	2564814	Is it Smash Bros., or is it like Mario?
2565174	2566595	It's supposed to be like Smash Bros.
2566715	2567615	Okay, okay.
2567675	2571137	But, you know, the only playable character is Mario right now, and...
2572443	2581128	The computer player doesn't really do anything, just kind of runs around trying to avoid you, and you can't really smash him off the edge, defeating the purpose of the Smash Bros.
2581829	2587012	Personally, I think they should just port over Mugen, but that's just... It's asking a bit much.
2587292	2588933	Well, I don't know if it would be able to run it either.
2590757	2594980	All right, well, if you are homebrew enabled on your DS, which I'm actually kind of curious.
2595140	2596822	I'm going to ask the chat room a question.
2597182	2599704	How many people are actually homebrew enabled on their DS?
2599824	2600985	We have how many people in chat right now?
2601025	2602386	Almost 50 people in chat right now.
2602746	2605668	I want to know how many of you are homebrew enabled in chat right now.
2605928	2608410	Say something while we go over some release dates.
2608450	2609031	We'll start with the UK.
2610117	2614259	Well, coming out in the UK, we have a number of things all on the 11th.
2614739	2617940	We have Beijing 2008, the official game of the Olympic Games.
2618740	2620581	The official video game, sorry, of the Olympic Games.
2620981	2621821	That's on PC.
2622462	2624442	Devil May Cry 4 on PC.
2625063	2626423	Doodle Hex on DS.
2626943	2628744	Secret Agent Clank on PSP.
2628864	2630365	Sports Party on Wii.
2631045	2634006	Summer Athletics on PS2, PC and Xbox 360.
2634466	2635887	And The Incredible Hulk on PS2.
2638311	2639052	Sounds like a busy week.
2641353	2645917	In the US, it's not that busy of a week, but there's still some stuff coming out.
2646818	2648259	Civilization Revolution.
2648819	2649900	I'm excited, yay!
2649940	2653663	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the DS.
2654764	2658867	Also this week, Unreal Tournament 3 for the Xbox 360.
2659767	2661709	We've got, let's see here.
2663402	2664682	Lots of people looking forward to that one on 360.
2665343	2665603	Yes.
2666103	2676686	Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii, which I guess it's not quite a port of the DS game.
2676706	2678146	I don't know.
2678226	2682968	Carnival Games on the DS, and Wonder World Amusement Park on the Wii.
2683248	2687549	Wait, is the Carnival Games on the DS the other way around, where they ported a Wii game to the DS?
2687789	2687989	Yes.
2688670	2689070	Interesting.
2689430	2689570	Yeah.
2691110	2712883	Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 Devil May Cry 4 on the PC PurrPals for the Wii Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on the PSP and let's see and I believe that's pretty much it for the week
2714443	2733303	Stickax282 says Civ Rev for the fucking win I agree, that's the game I'm definitely looking forward to because I actually really like the demo and I don't think it's going to crap on my childhood memories of the original Civilization which I was a little worried about at first so I'm pretty excited about that GameGuru agrees, Civ Rev for the win and Rob with 2B says Carnival Games is a different game
2733863	2742329	N, I don't Me, I don't even have a DS If I knew how to do it I am Sky, I am homebrew enabled Raise his hand, can play homebrew Nope, I am homebrew enabled Yep
2756840	2757761	DS, what's that?
2758121	2759803	I have not turned on my DS in like a year.
2760304	2761365	I'm not, but my friends is.
2762106	2764028	Yes, no homebrew on my DS.
2764869	2767171	I am homebrew enabled for DS, Wii, PSP.
2767551	2768512	I don't even have a DS.
2768813	2772316	And lastly, my GBA, DS, PSP, and iPod are all running homebrew apps.
2772577	2774359	That's actually a larger percentage than I would have thought.
2774779	2777442	Because I don't run homebrew on my DS because I just don't know how to do it.
2780492	2782394	and Loki's like, hey, you want a hit?
2783915	2787098	Well, once you get the device to do it, it's really simple.
2787218	2788740	I mean, it's just drag drop.
2790021	2790481	Interesting.
2791542	2796127	It's not like, you know, a Wii where some installation is required and that kind of thing.
2796667	2799390	Let's go over to Japan and look at some release dates coming out over there.
2799750	2800291	On the Xbox...
2801539	2804942	On the Xbox 360, some games are getting a price reduction.
2805322	2814631	Viva Pinata on the Xbox 360 is getting cut in price, as well as Forza Motorsport 2 and Test Drive Unlimited, as well as the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
2814651	2816853	They all move into the Platinum Collection in Japan.
2817193	2818073	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2847605	2865170	again a couple games go into the best series but here's what a lot of people are looking forward to Persona 4 comes out in Japan on July 10th and if you're a hardcore RPG fan and you can read Japanese and understand it you are probably importing this game I would imagine just call it a hunch
2866448	2878436	On the Nintendo DS, Custom Beat Battle, Draglade 2, Cosmetic Paradise, Maki no Kiseki, Pet Shop, Monogatari DS, Taito
2888303	2888544	Hmm.
2889285	2893791	On the Sony PSP, I doubt there's a lot this week.
2894492	2895234	Taking a look.
2896656	2897938	Oh, God of War, Chains of Olympus.
2898178	2898759	I take that back.
2899660	2901763	God of War, Chains of Olympus gets its Japanese version this week.
2902782	2903422	So check that out.
2903522	2908104	I thought I read that last week on the show, so I must have been looking in advance or something.
2908264	2911766	Also, a vehicle battle game comes out on the PSP from Irem.
2912626	2917389	Ponkotsu Roman Daika Sugeki Bumpy Trot.
2919750	2920610	God, what the hell do they call it?
2920650	2921630	Steambot Chronicles.
2924052	2925152	I like that other name, though.
2925172	2925612	That's cute.
2925752	2926313	Bumpy Trot.
2926373	2926933	Bumpy Trot.
2927967	2928647	Thanks for watching!
2945496	2949339	Random question from chat that has nothing to do with anything we're talking about.
2949379	2952482	FearTheClaw asks, well, sort of, because we mentioned it during release dates.
2952742	2955244	FearTheClaw asks, I've never played Viva Pinata.
2955304	2955744	What is it?
2955804	2956785	Is it really that bad?
2958026	2958827	Gosh, where do we begin?
2959067	2964551	Viva Pinata was Xbox 360's kind of foray to try and rip off Pokemon, in a way.
2964611	2966633	Not necessarily rip off, but... They went in at full bore.
2966653	2968214	They actually did a TV show.
2968254	2969315	TV show, everything.
2969776	2970016	You know...
2970416	2973799	The problem was, the game was too complicated for seven-year-olds to understand.
2974179	2978202	And then the teenagers and adults that wanted to play it, it was a little bit too much of a kid game.
2978843	2980424	So the original's not bad.
2980544	2983607	It's not a bad game by any means, especially considering how cheap you can find it now.
2983647	2986469	But the sequel, Viva Piñata Party Animals, that's bad.
2986910	2988431	Because that wasn't even the same type of game.
2989472	2989632	Yeah.
2990373	2994116	Vivo Pinata, Trouble in Paradise Vivo Pinata, Trouble in Paradise
3011528	3037522	Well, in other news, and this actually specifically goes for folks in Chandler, Arizona, at the McCullough Price House, there's a, I don't know if this is still going on, but it was going on as of the first, but an exhibit that's ancient history of video games, specifically on 70s consoles, and they are all set up to where, first of all, for games that didn't require electricity, like Lincoln Logs.
3039917	3040758	That's not a game!
3070097	3079083	Just to, it actually, as it started there, it actually moved on through towards more modern era systems, too.
3079444	3082906	Just, I guess, to show how video gaming has evolved.
3083566	3092012	And they were having a lot of people bring in their private collections to loan some of their systems in for the project.
3092132	3096995	And basically, sort of like how our Classic Gaming Expo was, if you remember that.
3097015	3099137	I was going to say, it sounds like the museum at Classic Gaming Expo.
3099617	3108999	That's exactly what I think it was like, but it even had a full 80s era arcade that had a bunch of games and exhibits set up.
3109359	3110159	They were all on free play.
3110899	3111119	Nice.
3114680	3123702	If it's still going on, though, if anyone lives in or near Chandler, Arizona, we would definitely appreciate if you would actually go get us some pictures from this.
3124651	3124951	Awesome.
3125452	3126072	We like pictures.
3126373	3126533	Yes.
3127053	3128755	I'd appreciate it if you stole something for me.
3130336	3131357	Remember, remember.
3131517	3132378	But we didn't tell you to do it.
3132798	3140324	Remember, if you value your soul, don't bother playing the Fairchild Channel F. It sucks.
3140404	3140985	So noted.
3141665	3142166	So noted.
3142446	3143227	Duly noted.
3144122	3147463	Music Monsters is a new music game developed by publisher Joe Wood.
3147483	3149104	It combines Owen Dunn with Jam Sessions and Band Brothers.
3168272	3197322	and it's kind of neat you have like that could be neat it's it's basically the gameplay is just like owned on there's little circles that you see that appear you have to tap with your stylus but as stuff goes along it's kind of walking you through playing like music on like uh they have like a harpsichord and then it goes to like this weird tripped out guitar thing and as you're playing the game um it will it's kind of like beatmania a little bit almost too where you like you'll play the you know guitar part then you play a keyboard part etc but they have like stuff in there there is um
3198757	3201199	I believe there was a Depeche Mode song in there.
3201379	3202159	Cool.
3202880	3212325	The ones I saw in there, also, other than that, Final Countdown, and there was the, was it Pneuma Pneuma or something like that?
3212605	3213086	Oh, God.
3213106	3216728	Is that the song that the fat kid dances to in that YouTube video?
3216868	3217348	I think so.
3217448	3219029	Yes.
3219189	3220870	Those were, yeah, in there as well.
3221030	3225393	So, no word on when that's coming out, though, yet.
3226454	3226894	Soon.
3226974	3227534	Hopefully soon.
3227594	3228455	Maybe the, you know,
3229454	3230875	Halloween Time, or something like that.
3258671	3260312	Thanks for watching!
3273678	3274318	I think it's great.
3275059	3275819	So there you have it.
3275919	3278300	And by the way, also a quote from Teasdale.
3278620	3283322	We've also secured what I can easily say is the best set list I've ever seen in a music game.
3284222	3285003	Oh, really, sir?
3285343	3288424	Well, some of that best set list apparently leaked out this week.
3288444	3290045	You know, YG4 TV.
3290245	3290925	Oh, gotta love them.
3291425	3291825	Except not.
3292666	3296427	In their show X-Play, they were showing a little clip of Rock Band 2 the day it was announced.
3296808	3297508	And here's the thing.
3297548	3301009	If you know how to pause your screen at just the right moment, guess what?
3301370	3303411	You can see part of the song list.
3303471	3312295	And it includes, let's see, Dream Theater, System of a Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Kim Wilde, Kids in America.
3312315	3313075	That was a DDR song.
3313735	3317577	Motorhead, Cheap Trick, Journey.
3318117	3319038	Thank you very much, Wynn.
3319818	3322880	The Who, Pinball Wizard Sweet!
3322960	3324701	Everlong Fuck yes
3349918	3353001	Rage Against the Machine, The Guess Who, Lenny Kravitz.
3353061	3355604	It could be either one because American Woman is the song.
3356284	3357826	Billy Idol, White Wedding.
3357886	3358807	That is badass.
3359307	3361109	Alanis Morissette, You Ought to Know.
3361309	3362931	I never thought I'd see that in a music game.
3362951	3363692	That's going to be awesome.
3363952	3365033	That's my favorite.
3365053	3366214	I never thought I'd see her in a video game.
3366534	3367335	Jethro Tull.
3367735	3367996	Yes.
3368176	3369397	Aqualung.
3369617	3369978	Aqualung.
3371427	3386436	either the Thin Lizzy or Joan Jett version of Bad Reputation Alice in Chains get this, even gets better this is where I start to go, this is too good Soundgarden with Spoonman and get this Jamie, this is the best ever Radiohead?
3387077	3398844	Not quite because you can use your Radiohead download content at least The Go-Go's, we got the beat I think I'm going to take the Alice in Chains with a big grain of salt because the song featured is Man in a Box I don't know how they would censor that
3399943	3401444	Well, they censored in the regular game.
3401464	3401904	You never know.
3402604	3403445	Well, it doesn't matter.
3403545	3404265	Journey is there.
3404285	3405546	That's an automatic win.
3405646	3406446	Automatic win!
3407487	3408067	Say no more.
3408587	3410528	You had me at Journey.
3411709	3413450	Proof that flutes do belong in a rock band.
3414490	3415671	Jethro Tull for the win.
3415731	3415951	Hi.
3417862	3422266	and HitStunInChat says, actually, yeah, I'd play that Alanis Morissette guitar part.
3422806	3424447	That was like her most rockin' song.
3424467	3425768	That would be great for a rock band.
3426769	3428771	And DreadlockLord says, are these rock bands?
3429231	3430272	Yes, some greats in there.
3430292	3432414	I just can't believe that she wrote that song about Dave Coulier.
3433034	3436277	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about Like a Prayer?
3436857	3437518	God, I hope not.
3438343	3447448	I've never in my life gotten over that Did you see the other one?
3447688	3455492	The other rumored track list or whatever So we've gone from little grain of salt to medium sized grain of salt to now big grain of salt
3455632	3457713	Yeah, this is big grain assault.
3458773	3460754	There was some leaked track lists.
3461094	3466495	First one, I guess, is from some guy named Demp, a commenter on 8-Bit Fix.
3467155	3473917	And he says he's got, I guess, someone that saw it via an email source or something like that.
3474077	3476958	Anyways, it's like a fourth-hand hearsay, they said.
3478039	3479159	Here's some of the tracks that...
3479739	3481120	Wow, Beastie Boys.
3481560	3486583	ACDC, Let There Be Rock, AFI, Alanis Morissette, which you ought to know on there.
3488043	3490765	Let's just read the important ones.
3490885	3498289	Beastie Boys, Beck, Blondie, Devo, The Donnas, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac.
3498329	3500190	No, this is too good to be true.
3500330	3501350	If that is the real list...
3503871	3506272	Game Set Match Survivor, Eye of the Tiger
3528732	3530432	Presidents of the USA with Lump.
3530713	3531033	What?
3532593	3533494	Bon Jovi.
3533874	3535215	No, this is a fanboy list.
3535255	3535775	It's got to be.
3535875	3538416	If it's a real one, I am so sold.
3539577	3540778	It's going to be good.
3540898	3541478	And you know what?
3541818	3544419	I bet you it's only a few more weeks away, E3.
3544499	3545900	They're going to announce some stuff about it.
3546160	3551623	There was also some rumors that there's going to be some additional hardware, optional hardware stuff for you.
3551683	3555065	I don't know if like effector pedals or something like that that's going to be involved, but...
3556297	3557758	Tell Me Baby, Snow, Heyo, Rush
3580134	3581935	Closer to the Heart, and Working Man.
3581955	3582595	That's pretty awesome.
3582995	3583995	Also, The Who.
3584616	3590258	They were going to try to get the entire album, Who's Next, but unfortunately the master recordings weren't all available, so you get something even better.
3590578	3593819	It's a best of The Who, and it's a ton of freaking songs.
3593879	3605283	Amazing Journey, Baba O'Reilly, Behind Blue Eyes, Eminence Front, Going Mobile, Leaving Here, Real Good Lookin' Boy, Sea and Sand, Who Are You, and live versions of My Generation, Summertime Blues, and Young Man Blues.
3605644	3608945	So for Who fans, you're ready to go with that.
3608965	3609565	I gotta ask, where are you from?
3609585	3611006	DarkSakura, you have more Rock Band news, right?
3628084	3629585	That I do, Mr. Rob.
3630726	3632488	As in, we played a bunch of it at my house.
3632548	3633689	No, I'm kidding.
3634129	3638993	There's actually a number of bands that are in talks to do different music games.
3641135	3644077	Frontline Music Label, of course, has Aerosmith.
3644698	3652524	Some of the other groups in talks are Guns N' Roses and Van Halen, who are wanting to put out music games.
3654065	3683074	and there's also the Eagles and Steely Dan have agreements in the works so we might be seeing quite a number of other really big names but there's actually one group that's never going to do it and that's Led Zeppelin because they don't want anyone to touch the master recordings I think they're just being bitches about it How about you?
3684332	3687936	They're bitches.
3688276	3689497	Well, let's see here.
3690438	3704692	In other news, completely unrelated to Rock Band, Firmware 2.40 for the PlayStation 3 was released last week and immediately pulled back down because there were some issues with it.
3705232	3718262	But 2.4, of course, as you may remember, was the one introducing the brand new trophy system, as well as in-game cross-media bar and, you know, custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.
3720143	3720604	Oh, well.
3721985	3728490	But, you know, there's obviously a problem, and they're working on fixing it, and hopefully it'll be up again soon.
3729330	3729851	But, um...
3731148	3732629	There was some other stuff I heard about that.
3732649	3735891	It was kind of interesting, though.
3736412	3742556	Well, they have some updates already for some of the older games that have come out to add trophies to them, which is pretty cool.
3743457	3743777	I don't know.
3743797	3748961	I think right now these trophies don't really mean much to me until I think Home comes out, and then you can actually display them.
3748981	3751002	It's like, oh, hey guys, we fucked it up.
3751182	3751782	Let's try again.
3753023	3757266	Yeah, I saw Scott Rubin was having some issues with 2.4.
3760387	3784291	and we got in chat Rob with 2B says thank god I waited to download it and Zappy says it's fine I've used it since Wednesday so it sounds like the problem is sporadic or what if it's a certain model of PS3s that's having the issues because you know they've had different types they've had you know the ones that can play PS2 games the ones that can play so alright so did you check out the firmware yourself Loki?
3784311	3786632	I'm sorry I skipped out for a minute nope not having it?
3787052	3787212	nope
3788621	3794924	I don't really care because I haven't played a game on my PS3 for a long time.
3794944	3797064	I don't think my PS3's been on in like three weeks.
3797745	3798465	I use it for movies.
3798825	3801766	But the next game that we're getting is the initial D game anyway.
3802346	3802546	Nice.
3803967	3808549	By the way, the trophies that are going to be the big part of 2.4 whenever they get the working version out...
3810279	3819562	Apparently, there was an earlier statement that every game would actually have trophies in it, but that probably only meant the actual first-party games, because you know what?
3819582	3825104	The third-party publishers, some of them say they're not going to go back and put trophies in the games because they've moved on to bigger and better things.
3825724	3834747	For instance, Insomniac, one of the bigger developers, they are focusing on Resistance 2, which I guess that would actually be a first-party, because Insomniac developed the game for Sony, huh?
3834767	3834927	Yeah.
3836008	3838150	They are focusing on Resistance 2.
3838250	3842654	They are not going to be putting trophies in Resistance or Ratchet & Clank Future.
3843094	3844475	This is not their biggest priority right now.
3844496	3845617	SSJ100Matt says, the trophies are a lie.
3851286	3851646	Indeed.
3852067	3857131	And by the way, also adding to the list, Call of Duty 4, Civilization Revolution.
3857971	3859192	Not right now for trophies.
3859432	3860133	Maybe in the future.
3860833	3862995	Unless they're yanking our chain, which is possible.
3863035	3863455	Who knows?
3863536	3866518	But I somehow doubt it.
3866798	3869540	Out of curiosity, you guys here in studio, what do you think about trophies?
3869620	3872963	Is it something needed or is it just like whatever or what?
3873331	3877336	It's kind of neat, but I haven't even really figured out what all that means.
3877937	3879680	I know there's different trophies you can get.
3879900	3882804	There are different bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.
3883505	3886829	I don't know what any of it means yet because I haven't played a game that uses them.
3887029	3887270	So...
3888431	3889472	Upload since they're shiny.
3912037	3913217	Maybe when Home comes out, who knows?
3913417	3918499	Well, Resistance 2 I'm definitely going to buy, but... Xenocore has a good point in chat.
3918559	3920200	Ratchet and Clank has its own trophy system.
3920240	3921420	Don't need the ones on the PS3.
3922160	3924761	GameGuru says, trophies like achievements are meh.
3925161	3929663	And Tigerclaw says, geez, just when we have to deal with achievement whores, now we've got to deal with trophy whores.
3930083	3931664	Wait until those houses open up in Home.
3931704	3932944	That's when you're going to see the trophy whores.
3932964	3934985	My Billy has gotten all these trophies.
3935005	3936505	That's when you're going to see the trophy whores.
3936865	3938946	Yeah, but you've still got no life, huh?
3939520	3941041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3966992	3967193	50 points.
3976286	3980888	It's Ristar, which is a platform game that was done by Sonic Team.
3981468	3987370	And if you play it, you will notice quite a number of similarities to the Sonic games.
3988250	3989210	Quite a number of them.
3990671	4003235	But it is... It's this little star who runs around, and he can move across bars and things, like monkey bar-type hanging bars.
4004155	4030660	and jump over things and shoot things well land on things really to kill them they're in a way but you go through different planets trying to to see you know trying to get through to I guess rescue the star goddess and I apologize guys for some reason we don't have the music tonight I don't know what is causing I may have to close Justin TV to do that but we don't have music tonight and I don't know why
4031789	4033170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4048513	4052234	This was an unlock in one of the Sonic collections?
4052514	4052914	It was.
4053054	4056955	It was in the Sonic Mega Collection Plus on PC.
4057295	4057515	Yeah.
4057735	4060415	And had a Game Gear release, too.
4061315	4069497	It's available on the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, and also available on the Virtual Console.
4070657	4073478	But as you go through the game, your health is actually registered in...
4075018	4078320	Starz, and each hit is one star.
4078360	4078841	Is that good?
4079621	4083004	No, it's the little theme song, because sadly, Rystar wouldn't work.
4083144	4083644	Sorry, guys.
4084825	4091769	But you also, as you gain momentum in running, you get sparks of stars that go behind you.
4091830	4093311	It's called Shooting Star.
4093491	4097513	And so you can fly in different directions.
4097553	4100675	But it's a pretty neat little game.
4101996	4105479	It had some differences from the Japanese and English versions.
4106399	4108120	Planets had different names in the English version.
4108140	4114864	The English one, in the Japanese one, he ran around with a very happy face the whole time except during a boss battle.
4115345	4120048	And in the American one, they gave him the angry face the entire time that he had during the boss battles.
4120408	4126932	There was also a skiing sequence that was added to level 5 in the US one.
4129093	4132395	Ito Mori was a giant cat in the Japanese version with a change for an ice monster.
4132716	4134897	There's anti-gravity shoes in round 6.
4134997	4137439	Different treasure names.
4137879	4146724	The European version of Ristar actually took advantage of larger resolutions that were available on PAL systems.
4149366	4157531	And actually the third game on the Game Gear version is if you play the Japanese version on an American Game Gear, the third stage is missing.
4160303	4160923	It just vanished.
4161143	4161503	Went away.
4161683	4162083	Pretty much.
4162563	4175866	But then again, if you play Burning Street that was on Genesis, if you put your Japanese cartridge into a US system, either by a converter or whatever, it changes the street to Rage.
4178026	4178246	Nice.
4179106	4181027	But it was put out by Acclaim.
