0	21280	Tonight, July 6th, 2008, a 16-bit RPG classic is being redone for the DS, Rock Band 2 leaks
21280	31560	at the internet, and could a popular racing game soon take on airplanes?
31560	35560	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35560	36560	Radio.
36560	41680	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
41680	42680	lifestyle.
42680	43880	My name is Rob Roberts.
43880	47920	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
47920	48920	Hi.
48920	50320	How are you, Jamie?
50320	51600	I don't know.
51600	54560	It's very, very hot here in the studio in Sacramento.
54560	60320	I swear if it gets above like 100, the little temperature thing he says is 99 degrees right
60320	61320	now.
61320	64200	If we were to hit 100, we would have to call a heat day, I think.
64200	65200	Yeah.
65200	66800	It's just very crazy.
66800	72320	But we're doing what we can to cool off down here in studio, but it's kind of a mess tonight.
72320	75520	Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
75520	80360	See, my computer room's normally about this temperature anyways because of, you know,
80360	81360	my high end computer.
81360	82840	It blows out so much hot air.
82840	86000	Even with the air conditioning on, it's a good 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the
86000	87000	house.
87000	88000	All right.
88000	93400	And then if I'm like recording video on my Xbox 360, that being as small as it is still
93400	96720	kicks out about as much heat too, so that really sucks.
96720	98280	All right.
98280	102840	Well, we've got lots and lots and lots of people here in studio tonight, and it's kind
102840	106960	of strange because, like, you know, we have our six year anniversary of Orange Orleans
106960	108920	Radio and frickin' nobody shows up.
108920	112320	We have a visitor come in from out of town, suddenly my garage is frickin' full, standing
112320	113320	room only.
113320	114320	What the hell is this?
114320	115320	All right.
115320	118720	So say hello tonight in order of importance.
118720	120280	Say hello first off to Intern Drew.
120280	121280	What's up?
121280	122280	How you doing, Drew?
122280	123280	I'm doing pretty good.
123280	124280	All right.
124280	125280	I gotta make sure.
125280	126280	Are we hearing Intern Drew tonight?
126280	127280	I don't know.
127280	128280	Are we hearing Intern Drew?
128280	129280	Yes, I think we are.
129280	130280	Barely, although that's very quiet.
130280	131280	I don't know.
131280	132280	Do I have the sensitive mic tonight?
132280	133280	Maybe I do.
133280	134280	I don't know.
134280	135280	Do I have the sensitive mic?
135280	136280	I don't know.
136280	137280	I don't know.
137280	138280	Maybe I do.
138280	139280	Live radio.
139280	140280	We're doing sound checks live on air.
140280	141280	What can you do?
141280	142280	Sound check one, two.
142280	143280	All right.
143280	144280	Anyhow.
144280	145280	Look, when I talk, it makes little lines up here.
145280	146280	Exactly.
146280	147280	That's the magic of radio.
147280	148280	You haven't figured that out after six years?
148280	149280	All right.
149280	153920	Also, say hello tonight to our website master.
153920	155800	Dark Tetsuya is here in studio.
155800	156800	Amazing.
156800	157800	Yeah, I know.
157800	158800	I made it.
158800	162240	You live in town, and yet you never seem to make it over here, but here you are tonight.
162240	165560	Well, Drew said he was going to come and get me yesterday, so.
165560	166560	Awesome.
166560	167560	Here I am.
167560	168560	All right.
168560	169560	Well, Dark Tetsuya is here.
169560	170560	We'll get him a little louder.
170560	172360	We're going to give him some mic lessons a little later.
172360	173360	It's all good.
173360	174360	It's been a while.
174360	177560	So he'll be here to comment on some of the news tonight, and then say hello to the one
177560	185920	and only joining us for all the way from New York freaking city, DJ Rama S is here in studio.
185920	186920	What's up, people?
186920	187920	How you doing?
187920	188920	Hot.
188920	190280	Yeah, I know.
190280	192520	It doesn't look that hot when you see it on Justin TV.
192520	193520	Does it?
193520	195940	No, but funny thing is I should be used to this heat, but still.
195940	197160	It's really bad tonight.
197160	200280	Like, we may have to take a heat break in the middle of part A just to kind of like
200280	201280	cool.
201280	202280	I'm serious.
202280	203280	Like, it's sad.
203280	204280	Don't laugh at me.
204280	205280	Huh?
205280	206280	We'll have to get the Gatorade.
206280	207280	Seriously.
207280	208280	It's pretty bad in here tonight.
208280	211240	And I don't want Jamie to die live on air.
211240	212240	That would be horrific.
212240	215000	I don't want to die on air either.
215000	216000	Yeah.
216000	217000	So we might take a heat break in the middle of part A.
217000	219000	I want to die on bacon.
219000	221160	Alright, say hello as well.
221160	225680	The good news is, since we broadcast at six o'clock, you know, the heat reaches its peak
225680	228920	around five o'clock, so it should be cooling off, thankfully, throughout the night.
228920	231260	Alright, say hello as well to, um, well, wait.
231260	234600	I guess we're not in order of importance anymore, because she'd be on the bottom of the list.
234600	235600	Rice Princess!
235600	238400	Wait, aren't I on the bottom anyway?
238400	239960	Aren't I the last person?
239960	240960	I don't know.
240960	241960	I'm just messing with you.
241960	242960	Shut your face, Rob.
242960	243960	Alright.
243960	244960	How are you, Miss Princess?
244960	245960	Mad at you now.
245960	246960	No, you love me.
246960	247960	No, I don't.
247960	248960	Alright.
248960	249960	Alright.
249960	252960	So we have a very full house tonight, just lots and lots of people to comment on the
252960	259280	news tonight, and of course, you, in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, we got lots
259280	263360	of people in chat tonight, we have stickax282, who says, I'm kind of new here to this whole
263360	264360	live thing.
264360	268280	Boy, did you pick a shitty show to have as your first show, because it's gonna be chaotic
268280	269280	tonight.
269280	270280	Um, but welcome.
270280	273360	Shadow Charlie says, holy crap, it's Rama.
273360	275360	Holy crap indeed.
275360	276360	There it is.
276360	279040	Jamie says, somebody dying live on air sounds exciting.
279040	283480	You know, I think it's one of those things that's better when you're at home watching,
283480	287560	but if you're like, live in studio, and considering the fact it's Jamie, and it would kinda, like,
287560	289000	I don't want Jamie to die.
289000	297000	I mean, Jamie said some things that have made me angry before, but I don't want her to die.
297000	298720	Heart.
298720	301960	I guess Jamie has died, and the ferret has taken over tonight.
301960	302960	Alright.
302960	306880	No, Jamie is alive and very well, and wants to talk to you all about her gaming week.
306880	308520	How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?
308520	311520	Um, I played Black Knight 2000.
311520	315200	It's imbalanced, but I managed to replay on my first ball, and that's the only time I've
315200	319640	ever done well on that game in my life.
319640	323640	I also played pinball at the House of Dark Soccer this week, and your pinball machines
323640	326080	like made it or something, it's like they grew.
326080	327280	It's been crazy.
327280	336200	We moved the wide bodies out into the garage, and we have both the Black Knight machines
336200	346640	inside, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Simpsons Pinball Party, No Fear, and World
346640	350160	Cup Soccer in the house, and everything else that's outside.
350160	352240	Dan's working on our friend's Indiana Jones machine.
352240	355640	Yeah, I was gonna say, when I was there, I saw an Indiana Jones machine that was being
355640	356640	worked on.
356640	360840	Yes, I actually ate a cookie off the Indiana Jones machine, it was pretty awesome.
360840	363000	It was very delicious.
363000	364000	They were mint cookies.
364000	365880	Yes, it was very delicious.
365880	366880	Orange Lounge Fudio!
366880	371880	Alright, anything else that you played with your week?
371880	372960	Any de-essing?
372960	376600	I played traffic a lot, and I played Getting Lost to San Francisco.
376600	377600	You played in traffic?
377600	379640	I played driving.
379640	383240	A lot of people tell me to go play in traffic, but I've never actually played in traffic.
383240	385440	I played Initial D, for real.
385440	389080	No, it was on the freeway, so it was more like one gun.
389080	390080	Awesome.
390080	391080	Awesome.
391080	394400	Alright, let's go around the studio and see what everybody else has been playing.
394400	398680	I will start with the guests tonight, I'll be nice, and Loki and I will go last.
398680	401120	Who has the mic for you kids over there?
401120	404240	Rice Princess, since you were on the bottom last time, why don't you start off, how was
404240	405240	your gaming week?
405240	406240	Non-existent.
406240	407240	Next.
407240	408240	Wow, you're boring.
408240	409820	Alright, Rama, how was your gaming week?
409820	410820	It was tolerable.
410820	417840	I played Super Mario Kart DS on the plane ride coming in, and throughout the week on
417840	423120	the subway, I was playing Custom Robo Arena, which has really become one of my favorite
423120	424120	games.
424120	425120	Interesting.
425120	430400	Tell us a little bit about Custom Robo Arena, I don't think I've ever heard of it.
430400	435800	Well, basically, Custom Robo Arena is like a Pokemon-ish type game, where you get this
435800	439240	little cube as a robot, and you customize it with different parts, and you battle with
439240	440240	it.
440240	443760	And one part of the style is like cleaning up your robot, because throughout the game,
443760	446880	if you're running around with a dirty robot, nobody wants to fight with you.
446880	450160	Is it like a Tamagotchi, where it'll poop randomly and you have to clean it up?
450160	451160	Mm-hmm.
451160	452800	Sounds awesome.
452800	453800	Sounds very awesome.
453800	455520	Not bad for $9.99, so hey.
455520	456520	There you go.
456520	458240	There you go.
458240	462640	What is this, Rama, before we keep the mic moving, I wanted to say, you also host your
462640	463640	own podcast, correct?
463640	464640	Do you want to give it a plug?
464640	465640	Yes, I do.
465640	471000	I host a podcast called Anime Jam Session with me, DJ Rama S, and one of my good friends,
471000	472000	Kuro Usagi.
472000	474360	We record Tuesday or Wednesday nights.
474360	479880	We try to get it out on our feed Thursday or Friday, so if you want to check it out,
479880	486280	you can go over to djramas.net or feedburner.com slash anime jam session, and we'll put it
486280	487280	out.
487280	488280	Awesome.
488280	490440	I want to apologize for the audio quality you've been hearing in the first little bits
490440	491440	of the show, too.
491440	495520	I think the mics got switched, and the guests got the mic with a very low gain, and I got
495520	498940	the one with a very high gain, so I was very loud, and they were very quiet, but we've
498940	501280	switched some things over here on the board.
501280	503920	I ninja'd over to the board and switched some things while they were talking about their
503920	506160	gaming Wii, so hopefully it's getting a little better.
506160	508960	We'll see as we move on, and Dark Tetsuya, how was your gaming Wii?
508960	509960	What have you been playing?
509960	511960	Oh, just a lot of Need for Speed Carbon.
511960	517480	I actually beat it, but I went back and did some of the challenges to unlock some more
517480	518480	stuff.
518480	522760	Now, don't you have a Justin TV channel or something where people can actually watch
522760	523760	you play games?
523760	527440	I stream random emulators and stuff.
527440	530160	What kind of games can people see if they check you out on the Justin TV?
530160	532200	Well, I'm working on Zelda right now.
532200	535400	I'm waiting to do Death Mountain.
535400	536520	Nice.
536520	539640	You know, I was actually on Justin TV very randomly one night, and you might not know
539640	542800	what Dark Tetsuya, but I was watching you.
542800	546080	That's the thing about Justin TV is you can actually watch people, and they never know.
546080	547080	Oh, yeah.
547080	550280	You were playing La Mulana, and that was actually the first time I'd ever seen it, so it was
550280	551280	cool.
551280	552960	I actually got to check that out.
552960	554840	It does look very retro.
554840	556840	I can see why people are really into that game.
556840	557840	Oh, yeah.
557840	558840	Very cool.
558840	559840	All right.
559840	560840	And you do not host your own podcast right now, right?
560840	561840	No, not at the moment.
561840	562840	Not at the moment.
562840	563840	All right.
563840	564840	Drew.
564840	568280	Intern Drew, do you host a podcast, for heaven's sake, or be honest?
568280	569280	Not yet.
569280	570280	No.
570280	571280	Oh, shit.
571280	572280	You got plans for one, don't you?
572280	573280	No, I'm not.
573280	576000	Any asshole with a mic can do a podcast in this day and age.
576000	577000	Shit, look at us.
577000	578000	All right.
578000	579000	Yeah, exactly.
579000	580000	All right.
580000	581000	How was your gaming week?
581000	582000	It was all right.
582000	588000	I have one of those Korean free-to-play what's-its action RPG.
588000	589000	I like that description.
589000	590000	I don't know how to classify it.
590000	593400	Korean free-to-play what's-it thingy-ma-bob guy.
593400	595200	I don't know how to describe it.
595200	598400	It's a platformer action game with RPG elements.
598400	606440	That, I've been playing some Fire Emblem 7, trying to actually beat it, which is brutal,
606440	608560	even on the first try.
608560	612080	And aside from that, I haven't been playing much.
612080	613680	Weren't you, Captain Excitement?
613680	622560	I picked up Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 at a used bookstore the other day.
622560	623880	I can't get it to run.
623880	626880	It crashes.
626880	628240	Best ten bucks I ever spent.
628240	629440	Thank you, Ubisoft.
629440	631080	Now make your games work.
631080	632080	Nice.
632080	634940	All right.
634940	639160	I guess that's gonna be, he's putting his mic down somewhat angrily, so, Loki, how was
639160	640160	your gaming week?
640160	641160	What did you play?
641160	642680	I'm trying to figure out which mic I'm supposed to be having here.
642680	644680	I think you're that one.
644680	645680	All right.
645680	651920	I didn't play too much this week, because I've been busy, and I did play, well, Grand
651920	654040	Theft Auto 4, which is not surprising.
654040	655640	I actually had some guests come over.
655640	660080	My sister hadn't seen Grand Theft Auto 4 yet, and she's a big fan of San Andreas, especially
660080	663640	running around aimlessly in the co-op mode.
663640	668380	So I showed her the swing set and other fun stuff about it, and she liked that.
668380	676320	And then I got to play a little bit of Defender Castle, and that was fun, and Mario Kart Wii.
676320	678080	We had to download a ton more Miis.
678080	683200	In fact, we got one that's got a crab on the person's face, which is kind of funny, and
683200	685020	it, like, pinches its claws.
685020	686360	And then there's also...
686360	687360	Crab people!
687360	688360	Yes, crab people.
688360	692640	And then one with Mickey Mouse, and, I don't know, we just downloaded a bunch of Miis and
692640	696920	then played at the levels with the Miis in the background, and that was funny.
696920	706080	And I just tried the homebrew Smash Bros. game that someone had made or worked on, and
706080	710640	I guess it's very early, because it's not very good right now, but, I mean, it's not...
710640	711640	Needs work.
711640	718240	It's not even close to being started, let alone done, so, yeah.
718240	719240	So how was it for your week?
719240	722080	You had a pretty slow gaming week, all things considered, but you got other projects going
722080	723080	on, right?
723080	725840	Yeah, I'm busy, and then my car was in the shop, so...
725840	726840	Oh, fun.
726840	727840	Yeah.
727840	728840	Fun, fun.
728840	729840	You've had an exciting week.
729840	730840	Not really.
730840	732280	Uh, let's see, my gaming week.
732280	736800	I got to play pinball at Dark Soccer's, which was pretty fun, I was mentioning that earlier.
736800	741160	She's got so many freaking pinball machines in her house, it's pretty funny.
741160	744080	And she's got, you know, the Black Knight 2000 I got to play for the first time.
744080	747540	I don't think I'd ever played that Black Knight table before, because what's really funny
747540	750840	about Jamie's house is that she has the Black Knight 2000 and the Black Knight right next
750840	751840	to each other.
751840	752840	So it's like...
752840	756880	Oh, but she's saying that she's borrowing the Black Knight, but it's still fun.
756880	757880	Still fun.
757880	760720	Um, so pinball goodness at Dark Soccer's house.
760720	762480	And then, let's see, what else did I play?
762480	771680	I played World of Drama Craft, which was exciting this week, and also I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith
771680	773560	for the first time at Dark Soccer's party.
773560	775580	They had Guitar Hero Aerosmith going there.
775580	781800	It's Guitar Hero 3, but with Aerosmith songs, and totally reskinned for Aerosmith, so that's
781800	782800	pretty much it.
782800	784280	That's all you need to know about the game.
784280	786000	They really didn't change anything from guitar.
786000	790760	I mean, I guess little bits in the story mode and what have you, but honestly, it's just
790760	793060	Guitar Hero 3 with Aerosmith stuff.
793060	797700	But the songs were good, I mean, because Aerosmith's pretty good, but I still don't think I could
797700	798840	spend $60 on it.
798840	802320	I would have to really, really love Aerosmith to spend that much money on it.
802320	804280	Dan really loves Aerosmith.
804280	805640	So then it's worth it to Dan.
805640	806640	But we didn't buy it.
806640	807640	Me?
807640	808640	Guitar Hero Journey?
808640	809640	I would have dropped the $60.
809640	812880	I would have paid $100 for Guitar Hero Journey, but it's not Guitar Hero Journey.
812880	815640	It's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.
815640	820480	But it did motivate me to go back and actually play some Guitar Hero 3, and I still cannot
820480	822880	beat that freaking Slipknot song on hard.
822880	823880	The intro ticks me off.
823880	824880	Did you download the free song?
824880	825880	I did.
825880	827440	The Top Gun song is awesome.
827440	830680	I wish it was Danger Zone, but eh...
830680	831680	That's all right.
831680	832680	It's still...
832680	838240	What a great patriotic tune to have the Top Gun theme, although it did make me sad because
838240	842340	it made me think back to my birthday when the Top Gun ride wasn't working at Great America,
842340	843560	and that pissed me off a little.
843560	844560	But the song made it all better.
844560	849160	Yeah, the last thing we need is, you know, homoerotic volleyball scenes.
849160	853960	Yeah, so I love that.
853960	858120	But here's the thing about Guitar Hero, is that you really have to get over, like, two
858120	862320	skill humps, I don't know what you'd call them, little skill checks, to get better at
862320	863320	Guitar Hero.
863320	864320	Okay?
864320	867040	One of the skill checks is that you have to learn how to strum up and down.
867040	870160	Like, if you just strum down the whole time, you're not going to be able to hit notes fast
870160	871840	enough during some of the songs.
871840	872840	That's the first little plateau.
872840	873920	That's a good name.
873920	875400	That's the first plateau you have to learn across.
875400	878940	I am currently stuck on the second plateau of getting good at Guitar Hero, and that is
878940	882960	learning how you don't have to strum for every note.
882960	887720	If a note has a little white dot on it, or a rock band, it's a smaller note, if a note
887720	891640	has a little white dot on it, you only have to hit the button for that note if you hit
891640	894640	the note correctly at the start of the sequence.
894640	899040	Like, that's the part I'm having trouble kind of getting over, because I want to strum everything,
899040	901440	and it's hard to tell when the notes are going to be that fast, which ones you have to strum
901440	902440	and which ones you don't.
902440	904640	Does Guitar Hero people in chat know what I'm talking about?
904640	905640	Please.
905640	906640	Or do I just sound crazy?
906640	907640	I don't know.
907640	909640	Because everybody in the studio is looking at me like, huh?
909640	910640	What?
910640	911640	Yeah, like the hammer-ons and stuff.
911640	912640	Exactly.
912640	913640	And the tutorial does not explain it that well.
913640	918640	The tutorial explains a little bit about how you can, like, never mind, I'm not even going
918640	921060	to tell you how to explain it, but the tutorial doesn't explain it very well.
921060	923200	It's kind of something I had to learn on my own.
923200	924760	So there you have it.
924760	925760	All right.
925760	926760	Enough of my gaming week.
926760	928680	You guys don't care about my Guitar Hero progression.
928680	932720	Although, I did beat two new songs on Expert.
932720	933720	Paint It Black.
933720	934720	Awesome.
934720	935720	All right.
935720	937200	Soccer Max says hammer-ons and pull-offs.
937200	938200	That's it.
938200	939200	Exactly.
939200	940200	Yes, Rama.
940200	941200	What?
941200	942200	Before we begin.
942200	943200	Yes.
943200	944200	I have presents.
944200	945200	Presents?
945200	946200	What a good way to start tonight's housekeeping.
946200	947200	Oh, shit.
947200	949400	I love housekeepers that begin with presents.
949400	952680	First off, before the show, I was showing the people on Justin TV this, but Loki got
952680	956800	me some new floor mats with Hello Kitty on them, which is hilarious because I already
956800	957920	had ones with penguins on them.
957920	959520	So I'm going to figure out how to use them both.
959520	962320	Maybe I'll put the ones with penguins out here or something.
962320	963320	I got a t-shirt.
963320	964320	Wipe your feet before you go in the house.
964320	965320	I got the t-shirt.
965320	966320	You got a t-shirt, too?
966320	968320	Oh, you have the t-shirt of Hot Topic.
968320	969320	I gun Liberty City.
969320	970960	I gun Liberty City instead of a heart.
970960	971960	But it's a gun.
971960	972960	Lovely.
972960	973960	Yes.
973960	974960	So, Rama, presents.
974960	975960	These are for you guys.
975960	978480	My official I love New York shirt.
978480	979480	That is very ironic.
979480	980480	Wait.
980480	982600	Hold that up and then have Loki stand up again right next to it.
982600	983600	Wait.
983600	984600	What the fuck?
984600	985600	Seriously.
985600	986600	What the fuck?
986600	987600	I know.
987600	988600	It's like a scene demo.
988600	989600	We have I gun Liberty City.
989600	990600	Again, you can look at this on our Justin TV channel.
990600	992520	I just give you orange ones right here.
992520	993920	And I heart and Y.
993920	998000	So it's like you have the real thing and then the parody right next to each other.
998000	999200	That's wonderful.
999200	1001520	I don't want to lie on a shirt.
1001520	1003000	You guys didn't plan that, did you?
1003000	1004000	You have no choice.
1004000	1005000	It's amazing.
1005000	1006000	Well, that's great.
1006000	1007000	Thank you so much for the shirts.
1007000	1008000	Wow.
1008000	1009000	That's great.
1009000	1011560	I'll change into one right now, but not live on cam because that's kind of gross.
1011560	1013560	So thank you.
1013560	1014560	Excellent.
1014560	1018240	I do heart and why I can't wait to go back.
1018240	1020240	So excellent.
1020240	1022320	All right.
1022320	1023320	Everybody in chat rooms.
1023320	1024320	Hello.
1024320	1025320	Welling.
1025320	1027160	Sorry to those of you guys that listen on the podcast, but the nice thing, excuse me
1027160	1028960	about Justin TV is that people can highlight.
1028960	1032400	So I'm sure there will be a highlight of that clip later on.
1032400	1033400	SSJ 100.
1033400	1037000	Matt in chat says, and why represent, I'm sure he would say just like that too.
1037000	1038000	Hey.
1038000	1039000	Hey.
1039000	1042480	Ice skull pirates.
1042480	1043480	Oh my God.
1043480	1044480	She is ice skull.
1044480	1045480	Fuck pirates.
1045480	1050080	I mean, what's wrong with you and your wildest dreams.
1050080	1054920	I feel like I need an eye blank, something shirt to fit in pirates.
1054920	1055920	No comment.
1055920	1057920	What is that?
1057920	1060000	All right.
1060000	1061000	On the butt.
1061000	1062000	It says pirates of the Caribbean.
1062000	1063000	All right.
1063000	1064000	Housekeeping.
1064000	1065160	Um, what else?
1065160	1066600	I don't really have anything for the show.
1066600	1069400	We have no interviews coming up, which is kind of sad, but I will say this.
1069400	1073660	We always have our live journal community in the MySpace communities and Facebook, Facebook.
1073660	1077480	We are the O L army, O L R M Y if you want to look us up.
1077480	1081600	If you want to join us on live journal, orange lounge, no radio, just orange lounge is us
1081600	1085560	on live journal and on MySpace, we are orange lounge radio, three different names for three
1085560	1086560	different sites.
1086560	1087560	If we could be any more confusing.
1087560	1088560	Good job.
1088560	1089560	Standards department.
1089560	1095400	Don't confuse us with the group orange range or the group orange lounge for that matter.
1095400	1098720	Although I don't think has Tomosuke made an orange lounge song in like the past three
1098720	1099720	years.
1099720	1100720	I don't think he has.
1100720	1101720	Has he?
1101720	1102720	No.
1102720	1103720	So we own it now.
1103720	1104720	I think.
1104720	1105720	I think there's some rule now that we own orange lounge.
1105720	1106720	All right.
1106720	1107720	Just kidding.
1107720	1108720	All right.
1108720	1111280	Let's get to tonight's gaming news and Loki's going to start us off tonight.
1111280	1112280	Yeah.
1112280	1113680	So more details about mega man nine.
1113680	1118200	It is going to be completely eight bit looking, including the very limited color palette as
1118200	1119200	well.
1119200	1124000	Uh, it's supposed to be also really fucking hard, just like, you know, most mega man games.
1124000	1129520	And in fact, uh, there was some, uh, hands on stuff, um, from like a joystick and some
1129520	1134840	other, um, groups out there including games, radar and stuff like that.
1134840	1139280	And basically seeing that they've, you know, a few run throughs on different levels and
1139280	1145040	it was damn near impossible, you know, kind of a famous puzzles from different games have
1145040	1146040	come back.
1146040	1154120	You know, the disappearing block, you know, um, platform puzzles and, uh, the one hit
1154120	1156040	kill, um, beams that go across.
1156040	1157040	Okay.
1157040	1158120	I forgot to mention about my gaming week.
1158120	1162160	I've been playing mega man, um, collected main man anniversary collection and I'm starting
1162160	1163720	with mega man one, right?
1163720	1168360	I am about to pull my fucking hair out on the ice man level with those fucking blocks.
1168360	1172760	Whoever invented the block puzzles needs to burn in hell.
1172760	1173760	All right.
1173760	1178320	Once you get past the blocks, once you get past, then it only gets worse and mega man
1178320	1181360	two and the heat man stage, unless you have item two, unless you have item two, which
1181360	1182360	you ought to.
1182360	1183360	Yeah, I know.
1183360	1189200	But seriously, until about the fifth game, the fifth NES game, I never thought a mega
1189200	1191120	man series is really that hard.
1191120	1195480	Rob, if you want to make everything easy on the first mega man, cut man.
1195480	1196480	I did.
1196480	1199080	I have killed the cut man, elect man, guts man, bomb man.
1199080	1202360	I'm just, I got to get ice man now so I can get fire man.
1202360	1206880	And if all fails, sorry, if all fails, you got the rabbit start pause trick and I guess
1206880	1207880	that's true.
1207880	1212160	And the cool thing too, also, um, the game is supposed to be out by the end of the, well
1212160	1216480	actually the beginning of the fourth quarter in, um, September.
1216480	1218060	So that's going to be coming out in Japan.
1218060	1223680	I'm guessing probably in the U S around the same time, you know, so, uh, we have a crap
1223680	1225400	load of people in chat tonight.
1225400	1230740	Chat that orange launch radio.com game grew says Nintendo games should be Nintendo hard.
1230740	1234520	So with an eight big game should come that cause is it just, we're, we're eight big games
1234520	1236180	more difficult than they are today.
1236180	1237180	I think they are.
1237180	1238180	Yeah.
1238180	1242680	Uh, rice princess, are you excited about mega man nine and it's a increased difficulty or
1242680	1243680	what?
1243680	1247880	I am because I do not like the, uh, current incarnation of mega man.
1247880	1249200	I like the oldest.
1249200	1250200	You don't like legends.
1250200	1251200	I love legends.
1251200	1253960	No, you don't like mega man X or any of that stuff.
1253960	1254960	They're okay.
1254960	1257460	No, I like the Nintendo mega man.
1257460	1260200	So this old school thing made you squee in many places, right?
1260200	1261200	Yes.
1261200	1262200	Good to hear.
1262200	1264880	I think they should just continue with making mega man games just like this.
1264880	1266680	Just make them all a bit from now on.
1266680	1272480	And you know, if you want to do the 16 bit or the little, you know, higher graphics games,
1272480	1274520	just do like the mega man X series.
1274520	1276360	They have really too many series going on.
1276360	1283560	They have that ZX series now, and then they also have, um, star force and just bring back
1283560	1286160	legends, bring back the original eight bit mega man.
1286160	1290080	Well, they are, you get, you get in half of what you want, but they need to continue
1290080	1292440	and you know, one game is not bringing it back.
1292440	1295240	Um, I got to, I got to read some comments as well from Justin TV.
1295240	1297480	We have more people in Justin TV than I've ever seen before.
1297480	1298480	This is crazy.
1298480	1303160	Uh, illustrator says real fucking hard keeps the ignorant noobs away, but mega man nine
1303160	1304280	is not really a multiplayer game.
1304280	1305280	So who cares about noobs?
1305280	1308680	Let a noob, noob themselves in their own home.
1308680	1312120	It's supposed to be fucking hard and then you keep playing it until you can pass it
1312120	1314080	and then you become better.
1314080	1316080	You don't just go, Oh, I suck.
1316080	1317160	Move on to next game.
1317160	1322160	You know, as, as it was said before about leading noobs to water, most of, most of what
1322160	1325600	you get are wet noobs and now you're leading noobs to splash woman.
1325600	1326600	Yes.
1326600	1327600	All right.
1327600	1328600	Yeah.
1328600	1331640	You know, I think she's going to be a bit wet.
1331640	1332640	Yes.
1332640	1334760	Oh, you're disgusting.
1334760	1337080	Maybe that's a little tagline on the poster.
1337080	1339900	This September's last woman gets wet.
1339900	1340900	Are we explicit yet?
1340900	1341900	Oh, we always are.
1341900	1342900	We all better be.
1342900	1343900	We always are.
1343900	1344900	Fuck.
1344900	1345900	Now we are.
1345900	1346900	Thank you.
1346900	1347900	No, not necessarily.
1347900	1352200	You have to say it a few more times because I watched, fuck, fuckity fucker, fucker, fuck,
1352200	1353200	fuck, fuck.
1353200	1354200	There you go.
1354200	1356760	Cause I watched Hancock over the weekend and they did have fuck in there once, but it's
1356760	1357760	still PG-13.
1357760	1360880	But it's got cock in the title.
1360880	1362440	Because he should have cock in the title.
1362440	1363440	His name's John Hancock.
1363440	1365320	Is that the fuck show already?
1365320	1366320	Orange Lounge Cock-io.
1366320	1369320	No, it's the cock show.
1369320	1371840	All right.
1371840	1376840	Anyway, so Mega Man Nine's been dated for September as well, right?
1376840	1379160	Yes, that's what I already said.
1379160	1380160	I'm sorry.
1380160	1381160	I missed it.
1381160	1382160	I was sleeping.
1382160	1388760	I was, I was thinking about Splash Woman's cock, um, cause you know, she probably had
1388760	1393320	one at some point, you know, doctor, uh, Dr. Wily has his leftover parts.
1393320	1394320	Anyhow.
1394320	1398800	You know, you know, what is it by with, with, with Wily and making every single one of his
1398800	1399800	robots male?
1399800	1400800	Hmm.
1400800	1401920	You think he's got a little secret?
1401920	1403200	Now he's branching out.
1403200	1404200	But he, but.
1404200	1405200	Is it sexist?
1405200	1406200	Dark soccer?
1406200	1407200	No, it's bi.
1407200	1408200	Is it sexist?
1408200	1409200	No.
1409200	1415720	Cause see, Dr. Wily likes little boys and, but that's okay because so does Dr. Light
1415720	1418080	and Dr. Light also likes little girls.
1418080	1419920	What the hell is wrong with this show?
1419920	1421200	For real?
1421200	1423400	I'm clicking unsubscribe right now.
1423400	1424400	Click.
1424400	1425400	That was disgusting.
1425400	1427600	So you're saying Dr. Wily's a member of the Catholic church?
1427600	1429680	God, Chris Hansen's going to be here any minute.
1429680	1431200	No, no, no, no, no, no.
1431200	1432200	Take a seat.
1432200	1433200	Take a seat.
1433200	1435240	Ah shit, you already took a seat.
1435240	1439520	Because I don't think there's any altar girls.
1439520	1441840	So he's probably Presbyterian.
1441840	1451920	All right, look, let's go, let's go to a much cleaner, safer, kid-friendly game.
1451920	1455240	Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing.
1455240	1461720	There has been a teaser in the latest official Nintendo magazine over in the UK.
1461720	1465200	And if you look at the magazine scan that's floating around the internet, or if you actually
1465200	1468440	own the magazine, it says, it's been a while.
1468440	1470640	It's time to revisit an old friend.
1470640	1473520	How's your village doing these days?
1473520	1477800	That is a, it just has a little picture from Animal Crossing and has that quote.
1477800	1479880	Could that be a hint that we get Animal Crossing 83?
1479880	1481520	I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet.
1481520	1482520	What?
1482520	1487000	I have thought that it's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions.
1487000	1489160	The Wii one's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions, why?
1489160	1491960	I think it's going to make you load your GameCube village.
1491960	1495400	Oh, maybe that's why the quote saying, how's your village doing all these days?
1495400	1498280	In other words, you better go pull some fucking weeds or you're in for it when the new game
1498280	1499280	comes out.
1499280	1500280	Shit, yeah.
1500280	1501920	It means I better go get my memory card back from my friend who was taking care of my village
1501920	1502920	for me.
1502920	1503920	It wasn't me, was it?
1503920	1504920	No.
1504920	1505920	No?
1505920	1506920	No.
1506920	1507920	That'd be funny is like the reason they're saying that they're all, yeah, you should
1507920	1509680	really go back and check how your village is doing because you're not getting a new
1509680	1510680	game.
1510680	1511680	Better go back and play the old one.
1511680	1513000	That might be the joke.
1513000	1514000	Rob.
1514000	1515000	What?
1515000	1516000	I've got the Japanese one too.
1516000	1517200	I got a new memory card.
1517200	1518440	I lost my old village.
1518440	1520480	I can't find it, but I have a new memory card.
1520480	1524920	So I'm thinking about making like OLR town and maybe playing it on Justin TV and letting
1524920	1525920	the chatters.
1525920	1526920	You can do that, Rob.
1526920	1527920	Yeah.
1527920	1528920	Let the chatters name.
1528920	1529920	For real.
1529920	1530920	We'll do that.
1530920	1533920	Because we have to have, who was the, who was the lesbian?
1533920	1534920	I don't remember.
1534920	1535920	She lived in my village.
1535920	1536920	There was a lesbian that lived in the village.
1536920	1537920	Yes.
1537920	1538920	I remember.
1538920	1543700	Her whole house was a gym and she was our resident lesbian, so we put a nice little
1543700	1544700	rainbow sign in the side of her house.
1544700	1547400	So we put a gay pride flag in front of her house and then she moved.
1547400	1548400	Yes.
1548400	1551720	And we ended up setting the, the, the, the pattern up and every time we visited.
1551720	1555080	Didn't we have her saying like, I like boobs as a little thing?
1555080	1556080	Yeah.
1556080	1557080	Animal Crossing is so awesome.
1557080	1559240	Someone went around going cock.
1559240	1565520	Um, SS2-100 Matt says the question is if Rob and Irene will quit WoW to play Animal Crossing
1565520	1566520	Wii.
1566520	1567520	Uh, yes.
1567520	1568520	Yeah, right.
1568520	1571280	Rice princess says she already has.
1571280	1573080	Are you getting a head start on only village?
1573080	1574440	Only if they'll bat me wool.
1574440	1575440	All right.
1575440	1577040	It is a 12 step recovery program.
1577040	1578040	All right.
1578040	1579040	It is a 12 step recovery program.
1579040	1580040	Well, we'll see.
1580040	1581040	E3 is coming very soon.
1581040	1582040	Yeah.
1582040	1583040	Well, pulling the plug is a one step recovery program.
1583040	1587160	I have my fingers and toes and other parts crossed that Animal Crossing will be an announcement
1587160	1588160	at E3.
1588160	1589480	So we'll see.
1589480	1590480	We shall see.
1590480	1591840	Let's move on with other news here.
1591840	1594760	Um, wait, actually I'll read a quick chat comments here.
1594760	1597720	Sharon says Animal Crossing was only somewhat kid friendly.
1597720	1599920	It taught you to not take loans from anyone.
1599920	1602900	If you do, you'll have to do bitch work for your neighbors and take all the furniture
1602900	1605280	they throw away for the rest of your life.
1605280	1606280	Nice.
1606280	1607280	Very nice.
1607280	1608280	All right.
1608280	1609280	Cool.
1609280	1610280	More news.
1610280	1611280	Gotta.
1611280	1612280	Gotta.
1612280	1613280	Mm.
1613280	1614280	Okay.
1614280	1615280	Hey, guess what?
1615280	1616280	Chicken butt.
1616280	1618280	There's.
1618280	1619280	Guess why?
1619280	1620280	Chicken thigh.
1620280	1621280	Aha.
1621280	1622280	In your eye.
1622280	1624960	This is totally one of those shows now.
1624960	1628840	It's it's, you know what, having people in studio like a live audience practically ruins
1628840	1629840	this show.
1629840	1630840	But Rob.
1630840	1631840	What?
1631840	1633840	For my show, for my story, you need to do something.
1633840	1634840	Okay.
1634840	1635840	What do I have to do for your story?
1635840	1638600	Go to the said site that this refers to from Squeenix.
1638600	1639600	Okay.
1639600	1642280	And play the sound effect and see if anyone in the chat room gets it first.
1642280	1646080	I I have a feeling everybody in chat already knows what's coming and I I don't.
1646080	1647080	But I want the sound effect.
1647080	1648080	All right.
1648080	1649080	Yes, ma'am.
1649080	1651040	Orange Land's radio is fucked up in front of a live audience.
1651040	1653040	What a demanding woman tonight.
1653040	1654040	It has to be there.
1654040	1655040	Let's see.
1655040	1656040	I've got to get there.
1656040	1657040	Here we go.
1657040	1658040	Oh, wait.
1658040	1659040	That's not it.
1659040	1660040	That's not me.
1660040	1661920	You're going to have to start reading the story.
1661920	1662920	I can't find it.
1662920	1663920	Okay.
1663920	1668640	It's a game that I'm sure a lot of people have been wanting for quite a while.
1668640	1672680	And by the way, it's the link that says Japanese website, by the way.
1672680	1674040	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
1674040	1680680	Are they bringing back to to some sort of system there?
1680680	1681680	Super Metroid?
1681680	1682680	Because that game is awesome.
1682680	1683680	No.
1683680	1684680	Squeenix didn't make some Metroid.
1684680	1691360	They're bringing back an RPG that is speculated to be a port, hopefully remaining in 2D on
1691360	1693440	the Nintendo DS.
1693440	1695440	Is it Infuriate or Super Metroid?
1695440	1697440	Shut up.
1697440	1699600	I see what you did there.
1699600	1701920	It's not at all.
1701920	1703920	But do the viewers, do the listeners.
1703920	1705720	I'm going to throw something at you, okay?
1705720	1706720	Please do.
1706720	1717320	Anyway, um, Chrono Trigger, if you go to, um, Squeenix's site, the, um, address is square-annex.co.jp
1717320	1727120	slash, um, uh, C-T-D-S. And, um, as Rob is pulling it up now.
1727120	1728760	It's kind of slow because we're broadcasting.
1728760	1729760	Yeah.
1729760	1730760	There you go.
1730760	1731760	There we go.
1731760	1734200	You want to hear the effect?
1734200	1735760	I don't even know if they're going to hear it.
1735760	1737600	We got so much shit running in the studio tonight.
1737600	1742480	At any rate, well, if you go to that site, you will see the clock.
1742480	1744160	And you will hear the ticking.
1744160	1746340	And you will know that it's Chrono Trigger.
1746340	1750440	Because no other game freaking has that clock making that same ticking noise at the very
1750440	1751440	start of it.
1751440	1752440	The clock stopped moving.
1752440	1756360	Yeah, my computer is not enjoying, uh, broadcasting an internet radio show and doing the Chrono
1756360	1757360	Trigger website at the same time.
1757360	1761320	So we will, we will let you do that for yourself so that you can have a truly interactive experience
1761320	1763120	those of you listening to the podcast.
1763120	1769000	Uh, AlphaKananagram says in chat, DarkSakura, now it's ChronoTrigger.jp as well.
1769000	1770000	Is it?
1770000	1771000	Rad.
1771000	1772000	Uh, Shaoranz.
1772000	1773000	Don't make it 3D, Squeenix.
1773000	1774000	Don't fuck it up.
1774000	1775840	Shaoranz says, Chrono Trigger, it's over.
1775840	1778960	Seriously, guys, there are other RPGs that have better storylines and better character
1778960	1779960	development.
1779960	1780960	No!
1780960	1781960	No!
1781960	1782960	Oh, snap.
1782960	1783960	No!
1783960	1784960	Oh, snap.
1784960	1785960	Object.
1785960	1786960	You did not, okay?
1786960	1787960	I think you did.
1787960	1789440	And, and they haven't translated the ones that do surpass it.
1789440	1795400	Here's the thing, I, I heard that the Chrono Trigger, oh, so what, Logie, what?
1795400	1796400	Nothing.
1796400	1797400	I'm, I'm good.
1797400	1800160	I just want to say about Chrono Trigger, it's not 3D.
1800160	1802080	Don't we already know it's going to be the same old sprites?
1802080	1803080	Yes, exactly.
1803080	1806360	We did nothing that we can tell, at least.
1806360	1808040	Bonus dungeon, Wi-Fi play.
1808040	1809040	Something like that.
1809040	1813440	Maybe, maybe add, like, some bonus dungeons and, um, I heard co-op, but, you know, how
1813440	1814880	can you play co-op in that game?
1814880	1815880	Because you have three people.
1815880	1817880	It would be, like, Secret of Mana.
1817880	1818880	Uh.
1818880	1820080	That might be a little strange.
1820080	1821080	I don't know about that.
1821080	1824640	Well, Secret of Mana, you could have, um, three characters in Seiken, too, but the only
1824640	1831080	way that you could control all three of them was, uh, having a tap.
1831080	1832080	That was fun.
1832080	1833080	That was a lot of fun.
1833080	1834280	I've got a multi-tap, so that was a lot of fun.
1834280	1835280	Good times.
1835280	1839840	But, um, but the other speculation, and actually I hope that this will be included, is that
1839840	1846640	the, um, the animated scenes that they did for the PlayStation version, um, are, uh,
1846640	1852160	are rumored to be making it to the DS version, especially if they're spending less of the,
1852160	1858520	uh, processing power on the way the game runs and putting more of it into having the cinemas,
1858520	1861200	because that'll, that'll make it sweet.
1861200	1862200	More endings!
1862200	1865200	SSJ100madass, uh, co-op, gato battle.
1865200	1866200	Ooh, sweet.
1866200	1871400	So, I wanna know, everyone who's in this room that's played Chrono Trigger, how many endings
1871400	1872400	have you gotten?
1872400	1873400	Two.
1873400	1875960	Hell, if I remember, probably four.
1875960	1877600	All of them.
1877600	1879280	You have no time on your hands, sir.
1879280	1881800	I mean, you have, uh, too much time.
1881800	1887680	What was the secret one where you go watch the, uh, she would open the thing with the
1887680	1889880	pendant and then you would go beat the game?
1889880	1895520	That was the very first one where you go in the teleporter and, um, right after you do
1895520	1900280	the teleport trick, and you can fight Lavas right from the start, but you have to, you
1900280	1902800	would, like, die instantly if you didn't do it in New Game Plus.
1902800	1904200	Oh, yeah.
1904200	1905200	Hmm.
1905200	1906200	And I've done that one.
1906200	1909280	That's the one where you get the developers ending, where you actually have representations
1909280	1913560	of the developers and you go in, like, the last room and it's Toriyama wearing his, uh,
1913560	1914560	gas mask and everything.
1914560	1918560	And the credits go by really, really fast, because, you know, they want you to skip past
1918560	1919700	it again.
1919700	1921480	All this freaking reminiscing here in studio.
1921480	1924400	Loki looks like he's about to, uh, explode wanting to talk about Elibits.
1924400	1925800	No, I don't really care, right?
1925800	1926800	That's right.
1926800	1931280	I didn't play really much of Chrono Trigger and I don't, I don't feel bad for not having
1931280	1934560	played Chrono Trigger either, so.
1934560	1939040	If I want to play Chrono Trigger, I'll hook up my Super Nintendo and grab my cartridge.
1939040	1941400	I think the DS one might be kind of cool.
1941400	1942400	I mean, it's...
1942400	1943400	I've been playing Final Fantasy VI.
1943400	1946400	The scene is getting a Chrono Trigger Super Nintendo cartridge at this time.
1946400	1949240	If you didn't hang on to one, it's going to cost you a lot of money to get one now.
1949240	1950240	Hey Rob!
1950240	1952880	This game is going to have the super secret final ending where you take the game back
1952880	1955320	to GameStop and trade it in for store credit.
1955320	1957760	Rob, please let go.
1957760	1960360	I didn't pay for my copy.
1960360	1962760	Someone gave it to me and he left.
1962760	1963760	So I have it in the box.
1963760	1964760	Nice.
1964760	1965760	Inherited.
1965760	1966760	I don't plan on paying for my copy either.
1966760	1967760	What a coincidence!
1967760	1968760	I know!
1968760	1969760	Alright, move on.
1969760	1970760	More stories.
1970760	1972280	Okay, less exciting news.
1972280	1978080	Elibits 2 has been confirmed and, uh, it's not the same Elibits you may have remembered.
1978080	1984400	Now it's some sort of top-down, sprite-based game and there's lots of Elibits running around.
1984400	1988480	It's almost like a cartoony version of Pikmin or something like that.
1988480	1989880	I don't know.
1989880	1994440	But Elibits, the Adventures of Kayin Zeros coming out this fall...
1994440	1995440	I don't know.
1995440	1997960	It looks weird.
1997960	2000920	Do you think maybe they're just like, you know, the Wii one just didn't work like we
2000920	2004640	wanted it to, so let's just jump ship and go to the DS, because we know it'll solve
2004640	2005640	more.
2005640	2008960	The 3D version on the DS and they're like, wow, that sucks, and then they're just like,
2008960	2013200	okay, let's see what we can do with the touchscreen and...
2013200	2014200	I don't know.
2014200	2018520	There's no way they could've done the 3D version on the DS anyways, because there's no depth
2018520	2019520	in it.
2019520	2020520	True.
2020520	2021520	True.
2021520	2022520	It'd be weird.
2022520	2024480	There's not a lot of depth in a lot of DS games, actually.
2024480	2026520	It looks like Pokemon.
2026520	2027520	It seriously looks like...
2027520	2031720	Well, Pokemon sells billions and billions of copies, so it probably is not a bad idea.
2031720	2032720	Yeah.
2032720	2034120	There you have it.
2034120	2037440	Coming to the Wii, however, even if Elibits 2 may not be coming to the Wii, apparently
2037440	2041900	Cooking Mama, there's going to be another Cooking Mama game on the Wii.
2041900	2047240	It's Cooking Mama World Kitchen, and it's coming to you from Majesco, and it's a follow-up
2047240	2051480	to the game Cooking Mama Cook-Off, which was kind of crap, because they tried to port a
2051480	2055000	DS game to the Wii, and it just didn't work very well, sadly.
2055000	2058800	Well, apparently Cooking Mama World Kitchen is a game that's actually being designed for
2058800	2063480	the Wii, and it's coming out for the holidays, and now instead of just the sprite graphics,
2063480	2068200	you're actually going to have polygon 3D-ish graphics, new minigames, new things to cook
2068200	2074360	up, and apparently, rhythm-based gameplay, so now Cooking Mama's going to be all rhythmic,
2074360	2075860	so that could be interesting.
2075860	2079000	This could either be really awesome or really crappy.
2079000	2080040	I'm betting on the second.
2080040	2082800	I really hope not, because Cooking Mama's kind of cool.
2082800	2083800	I don't know.
2083800	2085780	Jamie, I know you love Cooking Mama very much.
2085780	2087960	What do you think about a rhythm-based Cooking Mama game on the Wii?
2087960	2092120	I'll reserve judgment until I actually try it, but that's how I say it.
2092120	2093120	I know.
2093120	2095600	It's the same way, but your heart doesn't, like, you know...
2095600	2099760	I'm completely apathetic towards it right now.
2099760	2100760	Alright.
2100760	2101760	I will play it.
2101760	2105280	I'm interested, but I'm not going to make my judgment until I actually see it, because
2105280	2111760	honestly, I've had games where I've made a harsh judgment about them to start, and it's
2111760	2115520	turned out that they've been pretty fun, so I'm not going to...
2115520	2116520	Like Imagine Babies?
2116520	2117520	Hell no!
2117520	2118520	That game sucks!
2118520	2124600	That game is like the, it's like the bugs that live in shit.
2124600	2128080	Let's see, where did we have in the chat room?
2128080	2133000	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.
2133000	2134000	That might be a Cooking Mama.
2134000	2135000	We're listening to that this weekend.
2135000	2136000	That's the words out of my mouth.
2136000	2137680	Frisbee says, Cooking Mama Hell's Kitchen.
2137680	2142040	Now that might be a little bit fun if somebody screams at Cooking Mama and makes her cry.
2142040	2146480	Except if they base it off of a show, it should be based off of a good show.
2146480	2151120	Well, Hell's Kitchen is already getting a DS game, and it's actually coming out before
2151120	2152880	Cooking Mama, so...
2152880	2153880	Interesting.
2153880	2155760	I don't know if that's going to be any good, though.
2155760	2159000	Alright, well there you have it.
2159000	2160800	So we'll see about that Cooking Mama game.
2160800	2166240	I don't know, I have to admit, it makes me a little bit nervous, but we'll see.
2166240	2167840	We shall.
2167840	2176460	Well, for more happy wee news, this might make some people very pleased, but there is
2176460	2182480	a, uh, a little bit more coming out on the, uh, for WiiWare.
2182480	2185160	It was actually released on Friday.
2185160	2187560	It's um...
2187560	2194160	First is Pokemon Ranch, where, to quote, it's a place where Pokemon and people love living
2194160	2195160	together.
2195160	2196160	Bleh.
2196160	2197160	Yeah.
2197160	2198160	Anyway.
2198160	2200360	You don't think they need Pokemon Bunny Ranch?
2200360	2201360	No.
2201360	2203360	Or Pokemon Sniper.
2203360	2207960	It's Jigglypimp's Whore Lounge from Kalec in the House.
2207960	2208960	Slut Bunny.
2208960	2209960	No, I already showed you.
2209960	2211760	You need to watch that, okay?
2211760	2212760	Anyway.
2212760	2213760	I did.
2213760	2214760	It's a Pokemon parody, it's funny.
2214760	2215760	Yes.
2215760	2216760	Anyway.
2216760	2220640	Um, it's supposed to be sort of like a cross between Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon,
2220640	2227080	to where you will bring in your Pokemon from Diamond and Pearl, and you can play with them
2227080	2232360	and take pictures, and um, and you can do stuff.
2232360	2235560	You just can't level with them.
2235560	2238860	Shauran in chat wants to know if you can brand them.
2238860	2240360	That would be awesome.
2240360	2241360	Yeee-hoo!
2241360	2242360	Pika!
2242360	2245840	Uh, Pokemon Snap 2.
2245840	2247360	This time, you have a gun.
2247360	2248360	Kinky.
2248360	2249360	Pokemon Sniper.
2249360	2250640	A whole new kind of rail shooter.
2250640	2253360	Pokemon Snap-ther next.
2253360	2255360	Aww.
2255360	2257600	Cheeseburger says, Imagine Sniper.
2257600	2258600	Chat downwards on Twitter.
2258600	2259600	I would play Imagine Sniper.
2259600	2261600	That'd be like Silent Scope, though.
2261600	2270600	And, um, but it's going to be a thousand Wii points, and the other one is a game that you
2270600	2272760	pop bubbles on.
2272760	2274800	The bubble-popping game is finally coming out.
2274800	2275800	It's called Pop.
2275800	2277240	What a clever title.
2277240	2278240	You just pop bubbles.
2278240	2279240	Can you pop Pokemon?
2279240	2280240	Is it like Buster Brothers?
2280240	2288600	No, I think it's supposed to be more like, um, there's, it's a bubble-wraps, like, online
2288600	2289600	game.
2289600	2291080	I played with that the other day!
2291080	2292080	It was called Bubble-Wrap!
2292080	2296200	Let me, it was called Going to Seize Candy, and the best part is the Bubble-Wrap.
2296200	2297200	No, no, no, no, no, no.
2297200	2298200	What?
2298200	2299200	It was called I Bought a Teapot and Played the Bubble-Wrap.
2299200	2300400	Here's my question.
2300400	2304200	If you feed a Pokemon an Alka-Seltzer, will it explode?
2304200	2305200	That's what I want to know.
2305200	2306200	No.
2306200	2307200	No?
2307200	2308200	Only, only the avian ones will.
2308200	2309560	Well, that's some of them.
2309560	2310560	There's birds.
2310560	2312040	Pikachu giblets everywhere.
2312040	2314920	Rice Princess has this horrified look on her face.
2314920	2315920	Are you, are you okay?
2315920	2316920	Would you play Pokemon Ranch?
2316920	2318920	Does it sound like a fun game to you?
2318920	2319920	No.
2319920	2320920	Alright.
2320920	2321920	Wait.
2321920	2322920	Wait.
2322920	2323920	What?
2323920	2324920	It's 700 Wii points.
2324920	2325920	We'll see.
2325920	2326920	To pop bubbles.
2326920	2327920	This is awesome, though.
2327920	2330960	Nintendo and WiiWare, they're really doing, like, some different things.
2330960	2334640	You know, well, people want, like, a new Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game.
2334640	2337400	You get Crystal Chronicles, you know, My Life as the King.
2337400	2341080	It's not really a Crystal Chronicles game, it's more of, like, other people are having
2341080	2345320	fun outside of your city and you're just staying home watching TV, and that's kind of what
2345320	2346320	it is.
2346320	2351600	So, Pokemon, you know, Ranch, oh, well, yo, we could put out a Pokemon game on WiiWare,
2351600	2355960	but no, let's make a game where you take Pokemon from other games that you have to purchase,
2355960	2359160	or you can just sit there and wait days and days and days for a new Pokemon to come to
2359160	2363040	your ranch and walk around and do nothing, except take pictures with them.
2363040	2370360	I, I feel an OLR game somewhere in here called, like, God Damn I'm So Bored.
2370360	2371760	We play it every Sunday.
2371760	2376080	No, Rob, that's like, that's like, that's like the online, that's like the Mii parade.
2376080	2382920	And God Damn I'm So Bored, you start a podcast with your two friends, and then you just sit
2382920	2384520	there and pop bubble wrap the whole time.
2384520	2387320	I don't know, there's a game to be made here somewhere, I gotta think about it.
2387320	2392240	You also have to include, um, turning on your Wii for the first time and trying to watch
2392240	2395720	Mii March with only one Mii on it.
2395720	2396720	That's God Damn I'm So Lonely.
2396720	2397720	I, I, I, I had that moment in my first month of Wii.
2397720	2402320	No, no, no, because you eventually get more Mii as you open yourself up to the internet,
2402320	2406080	but I remember when we first got our Wii, we just turned it on, and Dan and I were watching
2406080	2407800	this blank screen going, where are they?
2407800	2408800	I want to see the parade!
2408800	2412360	No, seriously, all the games on WiiWare seem to be very limited and stupid like this.
2412360	2418320	I mean, there's, um, the Star Soldier game that has two levels, awesome!
2418320	2420320	And then there's, like, um, what else do they have?
2420320	2424180	Well, they have Dr. Mario, but that's just, you know, Dr. Mario.
2424180	2429120	And, um, they've got this other game that's another DS port of a game that's a ripoff
2429120	2430120	of Zuma.
2430120	2431120	And...
2431120	2432120	Magnetica.
2432120	2433120	Magnetica.
2433120	2434120	Totally different.
2434120	2435120	A better name.
2435120	2436120	A better name.
2436120	2437120	Well, it's not all...
2437120	2442120	Because Magnetica sounds like a Mega Man boss or something.
2442120	2443120	Magnetica.
2443120	2444120	Maybe not.
2444120	2450520	Um, and then they have, what is it, Toki Tori, which, that game's just lame, and, um,
2450520	2455080	the Bubble Popping game, which, I don't know, it's all kind of lame.
2455080	2456480	Alright, well.
2456480	2457960	Oh well.
2457960	2461080	Um, something else that hopefully is not lame.
2461080	2467120	Castlevania Judgment, the kind of, not really a Castlevania game, but now it's, uh, Soul
2467120	2468120	Castlevania.
2468120	2472560	You know, Soul Calibur, but Castlevania characters and that kind of thing.
2472560	2476400	Um, it will have Wii DS connectivity.
2476400	2486080	You'll be able to plug in your new order of S, what was it, uh, Ecclesia, the new DS platformer
2486080	2489480	game coming out, to unlock bonus gameplay content.
2489480	2492720	And also so Konami can say, we sold you one of each.
2492720	2493720	Sucker.
2493720	2499080	Let me guess, let me guess, I'm thinking a character that you only see in the DS game
2499080	2502480	is going to be playable in the Wii game if you connect them.
2502480	2503480	What do you think?
2503480	2504480	What do you think?
2504480	2505480	And, yeah.
2505480	2506480	What do you think?
2506480	2507480	And guess what?
2507480	2510760	It's probably paid to unlock content because you're paying for the DS game to unlock the
2510760	2513160	content on the DS that was already there.
2513160	2514160	Yeah.
2514160	2515160	Wouldn't surprise me at all.
2515160	2516160	Wouldn't surprise me at all.
2516160	2517800	But here's what you need to do.
2517800	2522480	You get a friend that has this game for the DS and you just have them come over and done.
2522480	2523480	No purchase necessary.
2523480	2524480	There you go.
2524480	2525480	All right.
2525480	2530800	Well, Loki was talking about this a little bit earlier during his gaming week, but if
2530800	2535320	you haven't heard yet, there's a homebrew Super Smash Brothers Rumble that's available
2535320	2537400	on the DS.
2537400	2541820	It's by a homebrew programmer that goes by the name of Fuzzy.
2541820	2543560	If you touch him, do you get dizzy?
2543560	2545960	That's what I want to know.
2545960	2546960	Bad joke there.
2546960	2550480	Now, apparently though, the game only has three levels in it right now and just one
2550480	2552240	character is playable in the game.
2552240	2553240	It's Mario.
2553240	2554640	Now, I have not actually played the game.
2554640	2557600	There's YouTubage of it, but Loki, since you've actually played the game, tell us a little
2557600	2558920	more about it.
2558920	2559920	It's very simplified.
2559920	2562800	I mean, it's sprite-based characters.
2562800	2564760	Is it Smash Brothers or is it like Mario?
2564760	2566680	It's supposed to be like Smash Brothers.
2566680	2567680	Okay.
2567680	2568680	Okay.
2568680	2573160	But, you know, the only playable character is Mario right now and the computer player
2573160	2574160	doesn't really do anything.
2574160	2577720	He just kind of runs around trying to avoid you and you can't really smash him off the
2577720	2581200	edge, you know, defeating the purpose of Smash Brothers.
2581200	2585560	Personally, I think they should just port over Mugen, but, you know, that's just...
2585560	2587040	It's asking a bit much.
2587040	2589720	Well, I don't know if he would be able to run it either.
2589720	2590960	All right.
2590960	2595000	Well, if you are homebrew enabled on your DS, which I'm actually kind of curious.
2595000	2597160	I'm going to ask the chat room a question.
2597160	2599800	How many people are actually homebrew enabled on their DS?
2599800	2601200	We have how many people in chat right now?
2601200	2602560	Almost 50 people in chat right now.
2602560	2605920	I want to know how many of you are homebrew enabled in chat right now.
2605920	2608440	Say something while we go over some release dates.
2608440	2609640	We'll start with the UK.
2609640	2614760	Well, coming out in the UK, we have a number of things all on the 11th.
2614760	2621080	We have Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic Games.
2621080	2622480	That's on PC.
2622480	2625080	Devil May Cry 4 on PC.
2625080	2626960	Doodle Hex on DS.
2626960	2629080	Secret Agent Clank on PSP.
2629080	2631120	Sports Party on Wii.
2631120	2634560	Summer Athletics on PS2, PC, and Xbox 360.
2634560	2636400	And The Incredible Hulk on PS2.
2636400	2639560	Sounds like a busy week.
2639560	2646880	In the US, it's not that busy of a week, but there's still some stuff coming out.
2646880	2654980	Civilization Revolution coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the DS.
2654980	2659840	Also this week, Unreal Tournament 3 for the Xbox 360.
2659840	2661200	We've got...
2661200	2662200	Let's see here.
2662200	2665520	Lots of people looking forward to that one on 360.
2665520	2666520	Yes.
2666520	2675600	Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii, which I suppose, I guess it's not quite
2675600	2678480	a port of the DS game.
2678480	2680760	Carnival Games on the DS.
2680760	2683120	And Wonder World Amusement Park on the Wii.
2683120	2686920	Wait, is the Carnival Games on the DS the other way around where they ported a Wii game
2686920	2687920	to the DS?
2687920	2688920	Yes.
2688920	2689920	That's interesting.
2689920	2690920	Yeah.
2690920	2697760	Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PS3 and Xbox 360.
2697760	2700800	Devil May Cry 4 on the PC.
2700800	2703600	Per Pals for the Wii.
2703600	2708360	Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on the PSP.
2708360	2710680	And let's see.
2710680	2714440	And I believe that's pretty much it for the week.
2714440	2719600	Stigax 282 says, Civ Rev for the fucking win, I agree, that's the game I'm definitely looking
2719600	2723660	forward to because I actually really like the demo and I don't think it's going to crap
2723660	2727440	on my childhood memories of the original Civilization, which I was a little worried about at first,
2727440	2728760	so I'm pretty excited about that.
2728760	2730940	GameGuru agrees, Civ Rev for the win.
2730940	2733920	And RobW2B says, Carnival Games is a different game.
2733920	2735160	It's not the same thing.
2735160	2738360	By the way, let's go back real quick before I do Japanese dates and see how many of our
2738360	2741520	chat rooms are currently homebrew enabled.
2741520	2744040	Let's see, where were we?
2744040	2745040	Where do we start in chat?
2745040	2747040	N, I don't.
2747040	2749480	Me, I don't even have a DS.
2749480	2751440	If I knew how to do it, I am, Skye.
2751440	2752680	I am homebrew enabled.
2752680	2754520	Raise his hand, can play homebrew, nope.
2754520	2755800	I am homebrew enabled.
2755800	2756800	Yep.
2756800	2757960	DS, what's that?
2757960	2760120	I have not turned on my DS in like a year.
2760120	2762000	I'm not, but my friends is.
2762000	2763000	Yes.
2763000	2764720	No homebrew on my DS.
2764720	2767400	I am homebrew enabled for DS, Wii, PSP.
2767400	2768800	I don't even have a DS.
2768800	2772660	And lastly, my GBA, DS, PSP, and iPod are all running homebrew apps.
2772660	2774880	That's actually a larger percentage than I would have thought.
2774880	2778840	Because I don't run homebrew on my DS because I just don't know how to do it.
2778840	2784040	And Mokey's like, hey, you want a hit?
2784040	2787000	Well, once you get the device to do it, it's really simple.
2787000	2790880	I mean, it's just drag drop, you know, no thought.
2790880	2791880	Interesting.
2791880	2796280	It's not like, you know, a Wii or some installations required and that kind of thing.
2796280	2799720	Alright, well let's go over to Japan and look at some release dates coming out over there.
2799720	2805360	On the Xbox 360, some games are getting a price reduction.
2805360	2810760	Viva Piñata on the Xbox 360 is getting cut in price, as well as Forza Motorsport 2 and
2810760	2814640	Test Drive Unlimited, as well as The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
2814640	2817560	They all move into the Platinum Collection in Japan this week.
2817560	2821960	As far as new games go, Kane & Lynch Deadman comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.
2821960	2823220	That's a new one.
2823220	2828120	Coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on July 10th, Dark Sector as well as Kane & Lynch
2828120	2831200	Deadman comes out on the PlayStation 3.
2831200	2833640	Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, checking out what's over there.
2833640	2835160	Not a lot.
2835160	2839800	Biohazard Zero, which of course is Resident Evil outside of the US.
2839800	2843800	Biohazard Zero comes out as well on July the 10th.
2843800	2848240	Going over to the handhelds in Japan, I'm sorry, first PlayStation 2, again, a couple
2848240	2851680	games go into the best series, but here's one a lot of people are looking forward to.
2851680	2855420	Persona 4 comes out in Japan on July 10th.
2855420	2860640	And if you're a hardcore RPG fan and you can read Japanese and understand it, you are probably
2860640	2864480	importing this game, I would imagine.
2864480	2866360	Just call it a hunch.
2866360	2868840	But I know people are crazy about Persona 4.
2868840	2873720	On the Nintendo DS, Custom Beat Battle Draglade 2 comes out.
2873720	2878380	Cosmetic Paradise, Maki no Kiseki comes out.
2878380	2880360	What else do we have here?
2880360	2883640	Another couple games go into price reduction, so lots of sales this week.
2883640	2889280	Pet Shop, Monogatari DS comes out from Taito.
2889280	2894720	On the Sony PSP, I doubt there's a lot this week.
2894720	2895720	Taking a look.
2895720	2899720	Oh, God of War Chains of Olympus, I take that back.
2899720	2902840	God of War Chains of Olympus gets its Japanese version this week.
2902840	2903840	So check that out.
2903840	2907880	I thought I read that last week on the show, so I must have been looking in advance or
2907880	2908880	something.
2908880	2912720	Also, a Vehicle Battle game comes out on the PSP from Irem.
2912720	2918160	Pongkotsu Roman Daika Sugeki Bumpy Trot.
2918160	2923920	It's um, God what the hell do they call it, Steam Bot Chronicles.
2923920	2925880	I like that other name though, that's cute.
2925880	2926880	Bumpy Trot.
2926880	2927880	Bumpy Trot.
2927880	2931160	See, I'd buy it here if it was called Bumpy Trot, but no, I just gotta have a lame name.
2931160	2934840	I have a bunch of these little harmonicas for that game at work.
2934840	2935840	I don't know why.
2935840	2936840	What?
2936840	2939920	It was some crap that they sent us to promote the game.
2939920	2944040	Unfortunately they sent it like a year after it came out, and I was like, okay, I can't
2944040	2946000	do anything with this.
2946000	2949360	Random question from chat that has nothing to do with anything we're talking about.
2949360	2952640	Fear the Claw asks, well sort of, because we mention it during release dates.
2952640	2955760	Fear the Claw asks, I've never played Viva Pinata, what is it?
2955760	2956760	Is it really that bad?
2956760	2959040	Uh, gosh, where do we begin?
2959040	2964640	Viva Pinata was Xbox 360's kind of foray to try and rip off Pokemon in a way.
2964640	2965640	Not necessarily rip off.
2965640	2968160	They went in it full board, they actually did a TV show.
2968160	2969160	TV show, everything.
2969160	2974200	You know, the problem was, the game was too complicated for seven year olds to understand.
2974200	2977680	And then the teenagers and adults that wanted to play it, it was a little bit too much of
2977680	2978840	a kid game.
2978840	2982520	So the original's not bad, it's not a bad game by any means, especially considering
2982520	2987000	how cheap we can find it now, but the sequel, Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's bad.
2987000	2990400	Because that wasn't even the same type of game.
2990400	2994160	But then there's gonna be another sequel that's gonna be Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise,
2994160	2998400	which is coming out in September on the 360, so if you really want to check that out, maybe
2998400	2999880	wait until that comes out.
2999880	3004840	And then there's also Viva Pinata Park to Paradise, which is coming out in the DS in
3004840	3005840	September as well, I think.
3005840	3006840	All right.
3006840	3008600	Well, let's get back to some gaming news.
3008600	3011120	Now you know release dates are out of the blood.
3011120	3017040	Well, in other news, and this actually specifically goes for folks in Chandler, Arizona, at the
3017040	3020960	McCullough Price House, there's a, I don't know if this is still going on, but it was
3020960	3027520	going on as of the first, but an exhibit that's ancient history of video games, specifically
3027520	3033720	on 70s consoles, and they are all set up to wear, first of all, for games that didn't
3033720	3040080	require electricity, like Lincoln Logs.
3040080	3041520	That's not a game.
3041520	3048120	I'm going through everything, but it's also got freestanding games like Centipede and
3048120	3053980	Space Invaders, and home consoles with, actually even there was one table that said set up
3053980	3060200	like a 1970s living room with a sofa facing a large wooden TV set.
3060200	3072240	And it had an Atari console plugged in with cartridges and everything, Telstar, and as
3072240	3079520	it started there, it actually moved on through towards more modern era systems too.
3079520	3083560	Just I guess to show how video gaming has evolved.
3083560	3089680	And then they were having a lot of people bring in their private collections to loan
3089680	3094600	some of their systems in for the project, and basically sort of like how our classic
3094600	3096800	gaming expo was, if you remember.
3096800	3099760	I was going to say, it sounds like the museum, the classic gaming expo.
3099760	3107000	That's exactly what I think it was like, but it even had a full 80s era arcade that had
3107000	3112600	a bunch of games and exhibits set up, and they were all in free play.
3112600	3120560	And if anyone, if it's still going on though, if anyone lives in or near Chandler, Arizona,
3120560	3124520	we would definitely appreciate if you would actually go get us some pictures from this.
3124520	3125520	Awesome.
3125520	3126520	We like pictures.
3126520	3127520	Yes.
3127520	3129520	I'd appreciate if you stole something from me.
3129520	3130520	Remember, remember.
3130520	3133120	But we didn't tell you to do it.
3133120	3140440	Remember, if you value your soul, don't bother playing the Fairchild Channel F. It sucks.
3140440	3141720	So noted.
3141720	3142720	So noted.
3142720	3145520	Duly noted.
3145520	3150240	There's a game that's, I guess, coming out in Europe that's kind of interesting, and
3150240	3155480	unfortunately this is a rather old article, but I thought it was interesting anyways.
3155480	3156880	Music Monsters.
3156880	3164500	It's a new music game being developed by publisher Joe Wood, and it combines kind of like, Owen
3164500	3168380	Dunn with Jam Sessions and Band Brothers.
3168380	3169380	And it's kind of neat.
3169380	3170380	You have like...
3170380	3171380	That could be neat.
3171380	3173360	Basically, the gameplay is just like Owen Dunn.
3173360	3176600	There's little circles that you see that appear you have to tap with your stylus.
3176600	3181760	But as stuff goes along, it's kind of walking you through playing music on like, they have
3181760	3186080	a harpsichord, and then it goes to this weird tripped out guitar thing.
3186080	3190440	And as you're playing the game, it's kind of like BeatMania a little bit almost too,
3190440	3195320	where you'll play the guitar part, then you'll play a keyboard part, etc.
3195320	3196640	But they have stuff in there.
3196640	3205280	There was, I believe there was a Depeche Mode song in there, the ones I saw in there, also
3205280	3212120	other than that, Final Countdown, and there was the, was it Numa Numa, or something like
3212120	3213120	that?
3213120	3214120	Oh god.
3214120	3216800	Is that the song that the fat kid dances to in that YouTube video?
3216800	3219320	I think so, yes.
3219320	3225760	Those were, yeah, in there as well, so no word on when that's coming out though yet,
3225760	3230920	but soon, hopefully soon, maybe the Halloween time or something like that.
3230920	3231920	Maybe more at E3?
3231920	3232920	Who knows?
3232920	3233920	Maybe.
3233920	3234920	Maybe.
3234920	3238720	Alright, well, probably the worst kept secret in the gaming industry, speaking of E3, was
3238720	3241320	that, hey, there's a Rock Band 2 coming!
3241320	3245680	So it was finally made official this week, Rock Band 2 is coming, and IGN ran this big
3245680	3251100	article about the whole thing, they had an interview with the lead designer of Dan Teasdale,
3251100	3254800	and this is the cool thing about Rock Band 2, anything that you downloaded in Rock Band
3254800	3257920	1, the download content, you are going to be automatically able to use in Rock Band
3257920	3258920	2.
3258920	3259920	Nice.
3259920	3260920	Very nice.
3260920	3263320	And hopefully it's not one of those cases where it's all already on the disc, kind of
3263320	3264320	like they did with the DDR games.
3264320	3265320	I don't think so.
3265320	3266320	But I don't think so, there's too much of it.
3266320	3269120	No, I think they just made it compatible with the songs that you download, because each
3269120	3273520	song that you download is like, you know, 60, you know, 30 to 60 megs, so.
3273520	3275080	I think it's great.
3275080	3276080	So there you have it.
3276080	3280920	And by the way, also a quote from Teasdale, we've also secured what I can easily say is
3280920	3283680	the best setlist I've ever seen in a music game.
3283680	3285440	Oh really, sir?
3285440	3290560	Well some of that best setlist apparently leaked out this week in a YG4 TV, oh, gotta
3290560	3291560	love them.
3291560	3292680	Except not.
3292680	3296080	In their show X-Play, they were showing a little clip of Rock Band 2 the day it was
3296080	3299880	announced, and here's the thing, if you know how to pause your screen at just the right
3299880	3301440	moment, guess what?
3301440	3306560	You can see part of the song list, and it includes, let's see, Dream Theater, System
3306560	3313360	of a Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fru Fighters, Kim Wilde, Kids in America, that was a DDR
3313360	3321600	game, Motorhead, Cheap Trick, Journey, thank you very much, Win, The Who, Pinball Wizard,
3321600	3323080	which, there you have it.
3323080	3325140	Everlong, fuck yes.
3325140	3326920	That sounds pretty awesome.
3326920	3330880	And then even more Rock Band 2 songs apparently came out.
3330880	3336600	This one, I mean, it's one thing to have the freeze frame on G4 TV, that's pretty obvious,
3336600	3341360	but apparently now also a user at the forums at Score Hero apparently has spent some time
3341360	3342800	with Rock Band 2.
3342800	3346520	This one, slightly bigger grain of salt, but this, I don't see why any of this wouldn't
3346520	3347600	be real.
3347600	3353080	Linkin Park, Mega Death, Rage Against the Machine, The Guess Who, Lenny Kravitz, it
3353080	3358000	could be either one, because this American Woman is the song, Billy Idol, White Wedding,
3358000	3362600	that is badass, Alanis Morissette, You Oughta Know, I never thought I'd see that in a music
3362600	3366400	game, that's gonna be awesome, that's my favorite, I never thought I'd see her in a video game,
3366400	3369720	Jethro Tull, it could, Aqualung.
3369720	3376960	Either the Thin Lizzy or Joan Jett version of Bad Reputation, Alice in Chains, get this,
3376960	3382920	evening is better, this is where I start to go, this is too good, Soundgarden with Spoonman,
3382920	3387120	and get this, Jamie, this is the best ever.
3387120	3389880	Not quite, because you can use your Radiohead download content at least.
3389880	3392480	The Go-Go's, we got the beat.
3392480	3395760	I think I'm gonna take the Alice in Chains with the big grain of salt because the song
3395760	3399880	featured is Man in the Box, I don't know how they would censor that.
3399880	3402720	Well they censor it in the regular game, you never know.
3402720	3406000	Well it doesn't matter, Journey is there, that's an automatic win.
3406000	3407000	Automatic win?
3407000	3408080	I mean, Say No More?
3408080	3411680	I think Jethro Tull was there, automatic win.
3411680	3414520	Proof that flutes do belong in a rock band.
3414520	3417920	Jethro Tull for the win, hi.
3417920	3422480	And Hit Stun in Chat says, actually yeah, I'd play that Alanis Morissette guitar part,
3422480	3426880	that was like her most rockin' song, that would be great for a rock band.
3426880	3429160	And Dreadlock Lord says, are these rock bands?
3429160	3430160	Yes.
3430160	3431160	Some greats in there.
3431160	3432720	I just can't believe that she wrote that song about Dave Coulier.
3432720	3436360	SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about Like a Prayer?
3436360	3437920	God, I hope not.
3437920	3439560	No, there's any God in Heaven, no.
3439560	3441560	I've never in my life gotten over that.
3441560	3445200	I didn't even know behind the music, I discovered it.
3445200	3446200	Did you see the other ones?
3446200	3448240	You're all welcome to go Dying of Fire, what's that?
3448240	3450600	The other rumored track lists or whatever.
3450600	3455040	So we've gone from little grain of salt to medium sized grain of salt to now big grain
3455040	3456040	of salt.
3456040	3458920	This is big grain of salt.
3458920	3464560	There was some leaked track lists, first one I guess is from some guy named Demp, a commenter
3464560	3473240	on 8BitFix, and he says he's got, I guess someone that saw it via an email source or
3473240	3474240	something like that.
3474240	3478120	Anyways, it's like a fourth hand hearsay they said.
3478120	3485840	Here are some of the tracks, ACDC, Let There Be Rock, AFI, Lance Morissette, which you
3485840	3490920	ought to know on there, Alice in Chains, let's just read the important ones.
3490920	3499720	Beastie Boys, Beck, Blondie, Devo, The Donnas, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, this is too good
3499720	3500720	to be true.
3500720	3506320	If that is the real list, win for Rock Band, game set match.
3506320	3510000	Oh my god, lit with her one hit wonder of my own worst enemy.
3510000	3512000	Okay, big grain of salt.
3512000	3518880	Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, no this is too good.
3518880	3524480	Let's see here, and then they had another one here, Loading Realities, another one,
3524480	3528800	they had some other songs.
3528800	3535920	Presidents of the USA with Lump, Bon Jovi, no this is a fanboy list, it's got to be.
3535920	3539640	If it's the real one, I am so sold.
3539640	3544560	That's gonna be good, and you know what, I bet you it's only a few more weeks away, E3,
3544560	3547640	they're gonna announce some stuff about it, there was also some rumors that there's gonna
3547640	3552580	be some additional hardware, optional hardware stuff for you, I don't know if like Effector
3552580	3556800	Pedals or something like that, that's gonna be involved, but you know.
3556800	3561840	But sadly, neither Loki nor Dark Sakura will be doing any singing in Rock Band, will they?
3561840	3562840	Sadness.
3562840	3563840	No I won't.
3563840	3564840	Ooh, yay.
3564840	3565840	Don't get me drunk, I will.
3565840	3567200	Alright, sounds like a plan.
3567200	3571840	Real quickly before we move on, in Rock Band 1 news, or will be Rock Band 2, because it's
3571840	3575500	download stuff, some new stuff coming out for the Rock Band download content, some Red
3575500	3580960	Hot Chili Peppers songs, Tell Me Baby and Snow, Hey Oh, and Rush, Closer to the Heart
3580960	3583200	and Working Man, that's pretty awesome.
3583200	3587520	Also The Who, they were gonna try to get the entire album Who's Next, but unfortunately
3587520	3591360	the master recordings weren't all available, so you get something even better, it's a best
3591360	3596080	of The Who, and it's a ton of freakin' songs, Amazing Journey, Baba O'Reilly, Behind Blue
3596080	3601200	Eyes, Eminence Front, Going Mobile, Leaving Here, Real Good Lookin' Boy, Seein' Sand,
3601200	3605680	Who Are You, and live versions of my generation, Summertime Blues and Young Man Blues.
3605680	3609640	So for Who fans, you're ready to go with that, that's great.
3609640	3611960	I gotta ask, where the fuck is the Nirvana we were promised?
3611960	3612960	Who cares?
3612960	3615280	No, no, forget the Nirvana.
3615280	3616280	Where's the weird Al?
3616280	3619520	He has original stuff, come on now, where's some weird Al?
3619520	3624580	Something big at E3, you can betcha, something big at E3, whether it's Weird Al or Nirvana,
3624580	3625580	we shall see.
3625580	3628260	So, but you have more rock band news, right?
3628260	3634360	That I do, Mr. Rob, as in, we played a bunch of it at my house, no I'm kidding.
3634360	3641620	There's actually a number of bands that are in talks to do different music games, Frontline
3641620	3648200	Music Label, of course there's Aerosmith, some of the other groups in talks are Guns
3648200	3655120	and Roses and Van Halen, who were wanted to put out music games, and there's also the
3655120	3663800	Eagles and Steely Dan have agreements in the works, so we might be seeing quite a number
3663800	3673920	of other really big names, but there's actually one group that's never gonna do it, and that's
3673920	3680400	Led Zeppelin, because they don't want anyone to touch the master recordings.
3680400	3684560	I think they're just being bitches about it, how about you?
3684560	3685560	They're bitches.
3685560	3686560	Too much hot.
3686560	3688360	I don't know.
3688360	3696920	Well, let's see here, in other news, completely unrelated to rock band, Firmware 2.40 for
3696920	3703600	the Playstation 3 was released last week, and immediately pulled back down because there
3703600	3708600	were some issues with it, but 2.40 of course, as you may remember, was the one introducing
3708600	3717200	the brand new trophy system, as well as in-game cross-media bar, and custom soundtracks and
3717200	3726280	all that fun stuff, oh well, but there's obviously a problem and they're working on fixing it,
3726280	3732680	and hopefully it'll be up again soon, but there was some other stuff I heard about that
3732680	3737880	was kind of interesting though, they're gonna do, well they have some updates already for
3737880	3743400	some of the older games that have come out to add trophies to them, which is pretty cool.
3743400	3746800	I don't know, I think right now these trophies don't really mean much to me until I think
3746800	3749120	Home comes out and you can actually display them.
3749120	3752880	It's like, oh, hey guys, we fucked it up, let's try again.
3752880	3758640	Yeah, I saw Scott Reuben was having some issues with 2.40.
3758640	3765120	And we had in chat, Rob 2B says, thank god I waited to download it, and Zappi says, it's
3765120	3767560	fine, I've used it since Wednesday, so it sounds like the problem's sporadic.
3767560	3771360	I wonder if it's a certain model of PS3s that's having the issues, because you know they've
3771360	3772360	had different types.
3772360	3780760	They've had the ones that can play PS2 games, the ones that can play, so, hmm, alright,
3780760	3784240	so did you check out the firmware yourself, Loki?
3784240	3786240	I'm sorry, I skipped out for a minute, nope.
3786240	3787240	Not having it?
3787240	3788240	No.
3788240	3794880	I don't really care, because I haven't played a game on my PS3 for a long time.
3794880	3797680	I don't think my PS3's been on in like three weeks.
3797680	3798680	I use it for movies.
3798680	3802120	But the next game that we're getting is the initial T-Came anyway.
3802120	3803120	Nice.
3803120	3807640	By the way, the trophies that are gonna be the big part of 2.40 whenever they get the
3807640	3813660	working version out, apparently there was an earlier statement that every game would
3813660	3819160	actually have trophies in it, but that probably only meant the actual first-party games, because
3819160	3822080	you know what, the third-party publishers, some of them say they're not gonna go back
3822080	3825760	and put trophies in the games, because they've moved on to bigger and better things.
3825760	3829520	For instance, Insomniac, one of the bigger developers, they are focusing on Resistance
3829520	3833800	2, which I guess that would actually be a first-party, because Insomniac developed the
3833800	3836040	game for Sony, huh?
3836040	3840120	They are focusing on Resistance 2, they are not gonna be putting trophies in Resistance
3840120	3841520	or Ratchet and Clank Future.
3841520	3844680	They may, well, it's just not their biggest priority right now.
3844680	3846440	I mean, big deal.
3846440	3847440	Get over it.
3847440	3850880	SSJ100Matt says, the trophies are a lie.
3850880	3852120	Indeed.
3852120	3858240	And by the way, also adding to the list, Call of Duty 4, Civilization Revolution, not right
3858240	3859560	now for trophies.
3859560	3860760	Maybe in the future.
3860760	3865720	Unless they're yanking our chain, which is possible, who knows, but I somehow doubt it.
3865720	3869600	What do you guys, out of curiosity, you guys here in studio, what do you think about trophies?
3869600	3873440	Is it something needed, or is it just, like, whatever, or what?
3873440	3877800	It's kinda neat, but I haven't even really figured out what all that means, like, you
3877800	3880000	know, I know there's different trophies you can get.
3880000	3883400	There are different, like, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.
3883400	3888680	I don't know what any of it means yet, because I haven't played a game that uses them, so.
3888680	3889680	I don't know.
3889680	3894720	It's just, it's neat, but it's not gonna, like, I think with the 360, I'm more inclined
3894720	3898320	to buy games and stuff, because it's like, ooh, I got all these achievements and stuff
3898320	3899320	like that.
3899320	3903240	Or at least to play them to their, you know, end.
3903240	3909040	But with the Playstation 3, I'm not really interested in it, I mean, as far as buying
3909040	3912120	games to, you know, play them for their trophies.
3912120	3913840	Maybe when home comes out, who knows.
3913840	3917080	Well, you know, Resistance 2 I'm definitely gonna buy, but.
3917080	3918560	Xenocore has a good point in chat.
3918560	3922260	Ratchet and Clank has its own trophy system, don't need the ones on the PS3.
3922260	3925180	Game Guru says, trophies, like achievements, are meh.
3925180	3928600	And Tigerclaw says, geez, just when we have to deal with achievement whores, now we gotta
3928600	3930160	deal with trophy whores.
3930160	3931840	Wait until those houses open up in home.
3931840	3932840	That's when you're gonna see the trophy whores.
3932840	3934800	My Billy has gotten all these trophies.
3934800	3936720	That's when you're gonna see the trophy whores.
3936720	3939360	Yeah, but she's still got no life, huh?
3939360	3940360	Alright.
3940360	3944880	Sadly, though, we can't go back and add trophies to some of the classic games from the past,
3944880	3946920	but you know what, they're better off without them.
3946920	3949840	But we always like to take a moment here at the end of part A on every episode of Orange
3949840	3955180	Laundry and pay some tribute to the old classics, and that's what we're gonna do this week's
3955180	3957000	classic game of the week.
3957000	3964000	Dark Sakura, gonna go to her gaming wardrobe, dig out an old, dusty cartridge and say, hey,
3964000	3965000	play this damn game this week.
3965000	3966000	What game is it this week, Dark Sakura?
3966000	3970000	This is actually a game that I think I might own, but I haven't played it in a long, long,
3970000	3971000	long, long, long time.
3971000	3974720	But it's for Osprey, who's not in the chat room.
3974720	3976360	Fifty points.
3976360	3981520	It's Ristar, which is a platform game that was done by Sonic Team.
3981520	3988400	And if you play it, you will notice quite a number of similarities to the Sonic games.
3988400	3989960	Quite a number of them.
3989960	3999000	But it is, it's this little star who runs around, and he, you know, can move across
3999000	4005680	bars and things, you know, like monkey bar type hanging bars, and jump over things and
4005680	4010280	shoot things, well, land on things, really, to kill them, they're in a way.
4010280	4018960	But he goes through different planets, trying to see, you know, trying to get through to,
4018960	4021440	I guess, rescue the star goddess.
4021440	4024040	And I apologize, guys, for some reason we don't have the music tonight.
4024040	4029000	I don't know what is causing, I may have to close Justin.tv to do that, but we don't have
4029000	4031820	music tonight, and I don't know why.
4031820	4037120	So sorry, guys, you'll just have to, maybe Dark Sakura can hum the tune, I don't know.
4037120	4038880	Music sounds very Sonic-y, anyway.
4038880	4039880	It does.
4039880	4042160	It looks very Sonic-y.
4042160	4044160	The game looks very Sonic-y.
4044160	4052480	Speaking of Sonic, I believe this was an unlock in one of the Sonic collections?
4052480	4060840	It was, it was in the Sonic Mega Collection Plus on PC, and had a Game Gear release, too.
4060840	4068000	It also was, it's available on the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, and also available
4068000	4070720	on the Virtual Console.
4070720	4075760	But as you go through the game, your health is actually registered in stars, and each
4075760	4079360	hit is one star, is that right?
4079360	4083280	No, it's the little theme song, because sadly, Ristar wouldn't work.
4083280	4084280	Sorry, guys.
4084280	4091840	But you also, as you gain momentum in running, you get sparks of stars that go behind you,
4091840	4099920	and it's called Shooting Star, and so you can fly in different tricks, but it's a pretty
4099920	4101920	neat little game.
4101920	4105520	It had some differences from the Japanese to English versions.
4105520	4109120	Planets had different names in the English version.
4109120	4114000	English one, in the Japanese one, he ran around with a very happy face the whole time, except
4114000	4117440	during a boss battle, and in the American one, they gave him the angry face the entire
4117440	4120560	time that he had during the boss battles.
4120560	4129000	There's also a skiing sequence that was added to level five in the US one.
4129000	4132840	Ita Mora was a giant cat in the Japanese version, which changed to an ice monster.
4132840	4137840	There's anti-gravity shoes in round six, different treasure names.
4137840	4144880	The European version of Ristar actually took advantage of larger resolutions that were
4144880	4149400	available on PAL systems.
4149400	4155360	And actually, the third game on the Game Gear version is, if you play the Japanese version
4155360	4160320	on an American Game Gear, the third stage is missing.
4160320	4161320	It just vanished.
4161320	4162320	It went away.
4162320	4163320	Pretty much.
4163320	4168840	But then again, if you play, what was it, Burning Street that was on Genesis, if you
4168840	4175240	put your Japanese cartridge into a US system, either by a converter or whatever, it changes
4175240	4177240	to Street to Rage.
4177240	4178240	Nice.
4178240	4183040	But it was put out by Acclaim, and it was pretty fun.
4183040	4184040	Alright.
4184040	4188480	It got a 9.5 by GameSpot.
4188480	4193120	Ristar is your classic game of the week, and you can check that out on just about any Sonic
4193120	4194680	Mega collection that's out there.
4194680	4195680	Sonic Team!
4195680	4199520	Game Guru is clarifying, Ristar was available on all the Sonic Mega collections, GameCube,
4199520	4200720	PlayStation 2, and Xbox.
4200720	4202240	So it's out there, waiting for you.
4202240	4204380	It's a Sonic Team game, it may as well be Sonic.
4204380	4207880	And sadly, it's the only way you're going to hear the music, thanks to our failure this
4207880	4208880	week.
4208880	4210320	Go on and find it.
4210320	4214600	I was going to mention, there was another game that they had gameplay footage of come
4214600	4219240	out this week, and that would be Wario Land Shake It.
4219240	4224040	And what's funny is that game looks very much like Sonic.
4224040	4225960	It's weird.
4225960	4226960	Could be interesting.
4226960	4228760	Could be very interesting.
4228760	4229760	Alright.
4229760	4234440	Well, that's going to do it here for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back
4234440	4238640	with plenty more, and we've got some fun stuff planned for part B. We're going to play the
4238640	4241080	match game tonight with all these people in the house.
4241080	4242580	You know that's going to be fun.
4242580	4246500	One chatter and one caller will get to go head-to-head in the OLR match game, and plenty
4246500	4247500	more gaming news.
4247500	4250720	We haven't even touched, barely, the Xbox 360 and some of this stuff, but we'll get
4250720	4254080	to all that when we come back after this break.
4254080	4258480	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice
4258480	4259480	a week.
4259480	4272440	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
