To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
We are live on this 4th of July weekend, except it's actually the 6th of July now in 2008.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Did everybody have a good 4th of July weekend? We have a lot of people in studio tonight.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
If you haven't listened to part 8 yet, we have tons of guests. Did you guys all have a good 4th of July?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Oh, we had a couple encounters, but yeah.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
A couple encounters? What's that mean?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Random encounters.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Random encounters? It's like you are suddenly attacked by a grey slime?

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
Yeah, and just substitute unexpected fireworks.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
Oh yes. Good times. Good times.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Now 4th of July, you're from New York City, Rama.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
So the 4th of July in a cow town like this one is a little different from what you're used to in Brooklyn, right?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Not necessarily.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Really?

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Even out in Brooklyn, it's very suburbanite. Out in New York City, we look forward to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
That's the big thing.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Do people go shoot their guns off in the middle of the street for 4th of July?

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
Actually, that's more up in the South Bronx where I used to live.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
You're confusing that with Texas.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
Alright, well, we hope everybody had a safe 4th of July. Unless you're not an American citizen, then I hope you had a good Friday.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
I would like to say in a very cryptic fashion that thank God the end of my headache is over.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
I can continue on with the work that I have been working on for a few weeks now.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
If I'm not mistaken, Loki will be unveiling something big on next week's show.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Hopefully.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Cross your fingers, cross your toes.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
The funny thing about the 4th of July that really quickly, because I went to the extravaganza at Dark Sakura's house that she had,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
stupid me thought, I want to bring something, I want to contribute to Dark Sakura's thing this year.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't want to be a leecher. So I brought fireworks.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I went out and bought like $40 worth of fireworks and brought it to the party.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
I was like, okay, cool.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.000
And only to be upstaged by all the more awesome illegal fireworks that were present.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
Yeah, our neighbor put in money for the legal stuff.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
So we never even set my group off.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I think we opened yours.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
No, I don't think we opened it. I brought it back.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh, you did? Oh.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
So I'm saving it for a rainy day, like Christmas. We'll set up Christmas fireworks or Halloween fireworks.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And we'll open presents next 4th of July.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Exactly.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Quick poll in chat room while we do the next story.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
When should I light off the spare fireworks that I have?

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
$40 worth of safe and lame fireworks.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
When should I light them off?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
For the fuck show?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Who knows? In the garage.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
That wouldn't be...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Do it now.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Do it now.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Our void says now. I don't think that's going to happen, sir.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Alright. It's the 6th of July party. Yay.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Alright, let's get back to some gaming news. Loki, kick it off.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Yes, no fireworks right now.

02:52.000 --> 03:00.000
But we talked a little bit earlier. Actually, Rob did during his release dates for Japan that Persona 4 was going to be coming out soon.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Well, guess what? Persona 4 is also making its way to North America as well.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
Just not until December 9th.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And that should be pretty awesome.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
And it was teased on, I think, a new trailer for Persona 4.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
So, December 9th is when you can get your Persona 4 on.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Oh, and it says also that each game will be bundled with the soundtrack CD as well with select music from the game.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
And there are many RPG fans going, squee!

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Does it come with a free spirit gun?

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
I think it's cool, though, that they're still cranking them out for the PlayStation 2.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Quality games for the PlayStation 2. It's not just a budget system.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Yeah.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
It's still got good stuff.

03:44.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, it's cheaper to develop for, and if they want to jump to the PS3, they'll still sell probably what they would sell on the PS3 with the PS2.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Alright. Lots of comments from chat about when to light off the fireworks.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Too many people are saying, do it now.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
And that's not going to happen with a gas heater in here, okay?

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
That's a bad idea. That's the kind of stuff that you see on America's scariest home videos.

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
Let's see. When you know who gets disbarred, says Amaze Satsuma, for the fuck show.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh, AJ Mix says at the beginning of the fuck show, and GS68 calls them fuck works. Nice.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I do like that idea.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
You can't do it for the fuck show because then you know when the fuck show was.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Exactly. Exactly.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
That would ruin it.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
Alright. So we're not doing them now, sorry to say. We're not stupid, and we're not going to end up on headlines.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Anyhow, we were talking about PlayStation 2 games, now PlayStation 2 games are still coming out.

04:39.000 --> 04:49.000
Get this, Sony is actually going to be coming out with an even slimmer and cooler looking, in their words, suave, version of the PlayStation 2.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Here's the interesting thing. It's going to be coming out in India first, and then Europe.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
It's going to be coming out on October 28th in India. There you have it.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
You know what that means.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
What?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Ben Heck will be able to make an even cooler PS2 portable system.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
The Economic Times, who reported this initially, also says there will be no more external AC adapter.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
The price will still be the same, about $162 American because this is in other countries.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
What do you mean no more AC adapter that's external?

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
I'm assuming that means the plug is built right into it, so you don't have to plug in an external adapter now.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
It's built right into the system, I would imagine.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
Well, I guess. Those power supplies are pretty small nowadays, especially with the micro-ITX stuff.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
There you have it. That's going to be pretty cool.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
I wonder if that will come out here most likely. Especially if there's still quality games like Persona 4 coming out, why not?

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
There's still a demand for it, and hey, they're a cheap DVD player on top of all that other stuff.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
At least that's what the rest of America thinks.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
So, there you have it. Moving on.

05:51.000 --> 06:03.000
Well, in other news, there is a list that was released by Hideo Kojima, who said what his top five favorite games are.

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
He was actually speaking to a newspaper, Yomiuri Shinbun, and he listed Super Mario Bros. series,

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
Outerworld, and Xevious as being some of the most memorable and influential games.

06:16.000 --> 06:23.000
He also brought up an 80s adventure game that was only in Japan called Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And, of course, Metal Gear Solid.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Of course. A little ego there. Anything else we'd recognize?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
The Super Mario Bros. series?

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Oh, Super Mario Bros. series. Sorry, I missed that.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Outerworld, Xevious?

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, okay. Sorry, I only picked up the last two for some reason. That's what I get for multitasking.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
But, you know, actually, if Kojima is fouling up this other game that I've never played, then I think I'll have to give it a try.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I'll try to find out what it's on.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
It's Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
So, what's up? Hideo Kojima talks. You listen?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Yes.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Alright. Fair enough.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, and I've bumped into him enough times that I think I should.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Awesome.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
So, there's some interesting stuff coming out now.

07:07.000 --> 07:13.000
PlayStation.com, I guess, was hacked according to a security firm's report.

07:13.000 --> 07:23.000
The IT security firm Sophos reported that someone has been messing around with the official PlayStation site, the US one.

07:23.000 --> 07:34.000
And, I guess, some of the messing around fits in with fake ads on the SingStar and God of War pages.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
And trying to, I guess, I don't know, put viruses or spyware or something.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
Were they trying to install spyware on people's computers? Were they trying to say, haha, we pwned Sony or what?

07:47.000 --> 07:58.000
It says basically that the bogus pop-ups prompted people that saw them to purchase, I guess, what turned out to be bogus anti-virus software.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
Dope. Oh my god, they put Gator on PlayStation.com.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Wow.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Apparently, though, Sony's already fixed the problem, but, you know.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
That still sucks.

08:12.000 --> 08:18.000
I would say, you know, if there was ever a list, and maybe we'll have to do this as a list list someday, even though it isn't directly video game related.

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
But if there was ever a list of, like, the most evil things to ever hit the internet, like the worst things to ever happen to the internet, Gator would be in the top three.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Absolutely.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
BonziBuddy would be also in the top three.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Don't get me started on BonziBuddy.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
YouTube.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Alright.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.000
Anyhow, this is sad news in the Sony department. You cannot has Kratos in Soul Calibur IV.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
That news was announced 1UP actually revealed at their most recent podcast because they've been playing the game.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Like you bastards.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
They actually have the game there in studio because, you know, certain media people are more special-er than everybody else.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
And so they've got it.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
And they've been playing the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions and no Kratos to be found anywhere unless it was some type of last minute addition.

09:02.000 --> 09:08.000
But let's see, if you think a big character like Kratos was going to be in a big game like this, do you think something would be a last minute addition?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Uh, download content.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
Possibly. That could be, but I don't know.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
I still say slim to none.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It would be, no, they could do that still.

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
I mean, as download content, and they could announce it at E3 if they want it to be a surprise.

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
Because they know better that certain media outlets out there, you know, especially if it leaks out.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
Oh, hey, I saw Kratos in Soulcalibur 4 leak, you know, it's just...

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Interesting. Alright, interesting thought.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Although I'm not that optimistic.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.000
DarkSoccer, I know you and the Hubby were debating which version of Soulcalibur 4 you were going to get.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Did you finally come to a consensus?

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
360.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
And why is that?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Online.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Oh, because the online...

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
Xbox Live is better. Sorry.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Do you think if Kratos had been in the Sony one, do you think that might have tilted you in the other direction?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Not at all.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Not at all. Not a Kratos fan?

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
No. I don't really... Honestly, I don't care.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Alright. Fair enough.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Did anybody check out Soulcalibur on Xbox Live this weekend?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I didn't hear anyone mention during their gaming weeks.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
I only checked out the demo. I didn't feel good enough reviewing it based on the demo alone.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
But it just seemed like the Dreamcast version.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
No EXO. But not that that's bad, because the Dreamcast one was pretty awesome.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
But there you have it.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
Alright. Anyhow, here's some content where you guys get to contribute to our program.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It's the mailbag.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

10:26.000 --> 10:33.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com and DarkSakura jumps into the emailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you here live on air.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com is the place to do it.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
DarkSakura, rip it open. What do we got?

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
We've actually gotten a crap ton, so I'm very sorry for some of the emails that I am not answering.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm trying to get to ones that I haven't really read before.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
No offense to the people who email us all the time. Let's hear from people we don't often hear from.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's see. I'm still actually going through them, so I'll start with this one.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Dear OLR team, my name is Simon and I live in Sweden.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm a first time writer to the show and I've listened for about three years.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I just wanted to tell you, you are the best and ask a question.

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
Unfortunately I live in a time zone where I can't listen live, so I have to make do with the podcast.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Which, by the way, is the best podcast on the web.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Anyway, why is part two released so late in the week nowadays?

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
I don't get part two until Friday night and most of the other stuff you talk about by then feels kind of outdated.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
Not that I don't enjoy what you talk about, but is there a reason why it can't be released on Tuesday or Wednesday instead?

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
It's been kind of my fault recently because I've just been so busy on Tuesday and Wednesday nights specifically.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.000
The ball's in my court to get that thing released.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
And with my birthday on the 4th of July, especially these past two weeks, it has just been a madhouse.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
So I apologize, that's not usually the plan.

11:47.000 --> 11:55.000
The reason why we don't do it in, well, first off, we just kind of felt, we've been doing it in parts A and B ever since we were syndicated on all games.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
And that's just kind of what we've grown used to and we like the fact that people would be getting two shows a week as opposed to just one.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Because, you know, we do a pretty darn long show here.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
But the idea was to have it sooner in the week, at least 24 to 48 hours out from part A though.

12:09.000 --> 12:18.000
And that's just because that way a lot of RSS audio grabbers will skip a file if you haven't already grabbed it.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Like let's say there's two new shows on the stream, it will only grab the most recent one.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
And so people miss out on half the show if they're not updating every day.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
So we try to space it out about 24, 48 hours to make sure people are getting each and every part.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
And just to, you know, so that you have something spread out throughout the week.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.000
Because most game shows release on Sunday, Monday. But much fewer of them release on Wednesday, Thursday.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
So that was kind of the whole point about that.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
So that's why we did it that way. So sorry it isn't a popular decision.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
But you never know, especially with our 300th episode coming up and talk of already changing some other things about the show.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
You never know, it might be one big show in the future. We'll see.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
We reserve the right to change things as we want.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm also not reading part of this email though because it is directed toward somebody else.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
But it says, thank you for an excellent show and take care.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
And there you have it.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
Okay, this one's from Rissimo, who I don't think I've ever read an email from.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
The name sounds familiar but it's been a while.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Hello all, I beat Metal Gear Solid 4 a couple weeks ago.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
Everyone used the word epic to describe the game. That's because there's no other word to describe it.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
It's one of the best games I've ever played, seriously.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm sick of people bitching about games cutscenes and not talking about how great the actual game is.

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
There's so much diversity in the actual gameplay, I find this alarming.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I just want to know if any of you actually played it or just watched a bit.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm curious to know what you think.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Lastly, a couple of questions for Jamie.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
Okay, did you watch any of the TV channels preceding the game?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Huh?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
They're bizarre.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Okay, and did you see the one where David Hayter experiences the interview from hell?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
And if you did, Fangasm much? I don't watch television.

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
I think, is it something like you leave the disc in and you see this random Easter egg stuff?

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
No, no, I didn't. Sorry. But I can.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
Yeah, no, I thought that the game was very diverse in the things that allowed it.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
But it's also, I guess this is up on YouTube, but no, never mind.

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
PS, I sent you guys a video months ago with my goddaughter playing my great 1000 mile rally arcade machine.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
Then I purchased a Street Fighter II machine and I'm now eyeing a pinball table.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
I have a lot of pinball in my youth, but don't remember many of the machines.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
One of my customers owns a pinball boutique and suggested either a Black Knight or Addams Family machine is the best ever.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
The Black Knight isn't too banged up, but it needs a bit of work.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Either one will cost me $2,000.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
I have heard you rave about Black Knight pinball, but can't remember you talking about Addams Family one.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
What says you? Thanks for getting me through this week.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
First of all, there's a Black Knight and a Black Knight 2000.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
And if it's Black Knight 2000, it's worthy, but I warn you, the game's a bitch.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
It's hard. Addams Family is really, really, really fun.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
I love Addams Family.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
And I think that if you're looking for a starter machine, Addams Family is going to be the one to go with.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
I think it's rec.pinball.something.

15:16.000 --> 15:24.000
I'll have to find out the user group that my husband goes on and try to get you in touch with his group

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
because Dan started off on a really banged up machine and worked his way up.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
$2,000 for an Addams Family? That's not bad.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
At least as far as I've heard.

15:35.000 --> 15:47.000
You're going to have to go ahead and start investing in rubbers and plastics and get carnauba wax for the boards.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
What do I use that for? Oh, pinball.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
For the actual boards themselves.

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
Make sure you've got Goo Gone handy and acid-free stuff because Rob.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
I'm sorry, but I didn't know you were talking about pinball.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Rob, resist the urge.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I live in the gutter.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Just email me later.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Anyway.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
Next email, and this actually is somebody different.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
Hey, guys. Dan Shadow here.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
While I was growing up, I had a lot of adventure and puzzle games to play.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
Some of my favorites were the Monkey Island series, Loom.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Thank you! Loom is great.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
King's Quest before 3D, Toonstruck the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
For the most part, those games were just point and clickers,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
but they all had great dialogue and good puzzles that fit into the gameplay.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I mean, insult sword fighting was the best.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
My question is a two-parter.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Aside from games like Professor Layton and Hotel Dusk,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
will we ever see a return of the good, plain, fun adventure game?

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Part of the greatness of the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
was that they were of a much darker tone.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Did you ever play Phantasmagoria?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Yes, I did play Phantasmagoria. It was awesome.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.000
My second question is, if we do ever see more adventure games,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
are they fated to be just childish games that will work for all ages?

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
Honestly, I would love to see another Phantasmagoria. Wouldn't that be awesome?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Seven CDs, that game was.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
That game was epic.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I'd love to see another Monkey Island.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Only because the emailer isn't saying it,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I would hope to gosh you already know about it,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
but Sam and Max, seriously, if you're not playing it,

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
this game was made for someone like you who loves these old 90s puzzlers.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.000
And just the cool thing, and I hate sounding like a salesman for this service,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
but I do like it. I honestly do.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
GameTap has all these old-school PC games,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
a lot of the ones you're talking about on there.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Rob, you fight like a dairy farmer.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Shut up.

17:35.000 --> 17:40.000
Oh, Justin sent me an email that reminded me that the song I was trying to think of was Lab,

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
from 2DX8 style, that had the hearty hadoken.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Oh.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Well, I'm looking.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'll have to dig it up.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
8th style, Rob.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Oh, yeah, I got it.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
We got an email from Sauce.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Okay.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
It says, hi, Soess, which is my online nickname of the Saucers.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Skye, other guy, and DJ Ron, my guest.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
Andrew, if he's there too.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Seeing how I know DarkSakura thoroughly enjoyed reading my lengthy multi-paragraph review

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
of the Iron Man video game released by Sony,

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
I thought it'd only be fair to review another game, Lego Indiana Jones.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
But to be kind to her vocal cords rather than writing the review up here in this email,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
I've written it up in my own blog and provided a link to paste into the chat room,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
which I will in just a moment.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
The journal, though, is marronmarvel.livejournal.com.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
It's M-A-R-R-O-N, Marvel.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
We will soon be writing for Orange Launch Radio when we get our new website done,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
which is the next big task here at Camp O-L-R.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
This is part of a project I'm working on for the O-L-R website.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
It's obviously an aptly named project.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Update the website so more content can be added.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
My bad.

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
But for now, the review sits on my own blog until Skye and I can get together and work something out.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
The short version of the review is that Lego Indiana Jones is an extremely fun game

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
worth investing in for both kids and adults alike.

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
It comes on a variety of platforms, and I suggest playing it on DS or PSP over Xbox or Wii.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
The feel of the game is much more to be enjoyed in small settings

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
between other things like classes on bus rides or what have you

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
than as a sit-in-front-of-the-TV console game.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Anyway, that's it for now.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
I'm sure Dark Soccer has another dozen or so emails to read.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Keep up the great work, O-L-R.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Sincerely, your friendly neighborhood sauce.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Friendly neighborhood sauce. I like that. Very nice.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
I have posted link in there.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
And I love that she's dedicated.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
I need someone like that to keep poking me and going,

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
website, website, website, but I'm really glad there's enthusiastic people.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I could do that, but I have sharp things to poke you with.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
No, I don't like sharp things.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
No, me no likey.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
Well, if you keep poking me, then I am not going to give you.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
This song was a bitch on 2DX. That's all I will say.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Fuck yeah, it was.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I think I beat it on 7 keys once and then I died.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
There you have it.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
That's lab.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
That was lab.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Hey guys and gal, I've been listening to this show from us for years.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
It is also the first podcast I have ever listened to,

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
but I have never been able to listen live because of school, family, etc.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Abandon them all. Just kidding.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
My computer just became unplugged, give me a second.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Dope.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
There's one thing I really want to know that you guys have never said,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
you're gamertags.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
I understand if you don't want to share them because of privacy and stuff,

20:22.000 --> 20:26.000
but it would be great to actually play on live with one of you guys

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
and maybe even work on Loki at GTA IV cough.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
Love this show and keep up the good work from Taco4Brain,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
which is my gamertag by the way.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
PS, Imagine Babies would have been a lot better with Harpoon's Fire and Dragon Force.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
This is going to sound so horrible, but I don't know any other way to put it.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
The sad thing is my list, I don't have a problem giving my gamertag out

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
because it's on the forums, it's green sky, but it's S-K-I-E.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
All one word.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
But here's the problem, is that my friends list is completely full.

20:56.000 --> 21:02.000
And Microsoft does not address the issue about letting us expand our friends list yet.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And I try to when new OLR listeners want to be added,

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
I go in my list and I look for people who haven't signed on in like a week

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
and I'll delete them, but the problem is I'm trying to balance,

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
like I don't want to delete anybody I know offline,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
but I also don't want to make any OLR listeners sad,

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
so I'm having to play this really delicate balancing game with the friend list.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
So you can send me a friend request.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
I guess I could delete someone who hasn't signed on in a week, but it's tough.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Please don't be hurt if I defriend you or refuse your friend request.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
I'm just full.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
And I'm not even on Xbox that often.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Stop.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I'm still waiting on my request.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Didn't I accept it?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It bounced back saying it was full.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh, you got to like call me or text me and say I'm going to try to add you

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
and then I'll dump somebody who hasn't signed on in a week and then add you.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
How about after the show maybe?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
Alright, we'll do that.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Cool.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
We'll do that after the show.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I'm sorry.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
It's okay.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
On the same subject, my We Connect 24 is now working.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
Nice.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
So if you want to add me.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
And it's all in the forum, because you don't know your friend code I would imagine.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Not that I can.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
But it's all in the friend's code thread on forums.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Or no, orange.radio.com, click on forums.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
Yes.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
There you have it.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
On a similar related note, I don't have a 360,

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
so I naturally don't have a gamertag,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
but I am in the O.L. Army clown on X-Fire,

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
so if you want to pop on and own my asset like Day of Defeat Source or Counter-Strike,

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
feel free.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
It's in the forums.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
Check the thread there under PC Games.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
See, Fear the Claw in chat says,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Aw, how sad.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Sky has too many friends.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
Cry face.

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
I hate, I feel like I sound like a stuck up ass when I say that.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
Rob.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
What?

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
You are a whore darling.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I'm sorry.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I just, you know, I.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Okay.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Emails, please.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
It is what it is.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
All right, what?

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
I'm going to quickly go through some of these and paraphrase them.

22:51.000 --> 22:58.000
GS68, who introduces himself in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Ola.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
Wanted to know what happened to the guy who said the geeks in Otaku

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
were the only ones who wanted more storage space,

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
and said that it's sad that Representative Nintendo would have to, you know,

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
hold to a level of professionalism and didn't.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Well, you haven't heard from him lately, so that's hopefully a good sign.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Thumbs up, Nintendo.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
He liked the interview.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Good.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.000
And wants us to come to Final Mate 2009, which will be a likely.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Most likely, yeah.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
Outlook good on the Magic 8 Ball.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
And says, this email was brought to you by Sizzler Home of the Endless Salads.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
By the way, California Extremes in two weeks starts soccer.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm going.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
Do we want to check out there?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.000
Fuck yeah.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
You have room in your car for one more?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
Sure.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
All right.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
You're only going for the one day, right?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
You're not going to stay overnight or anything?

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I don't think we're going to stay overnight, but we might go back.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Okay.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I might just go for one day.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
I think we're going to do the Saturday.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Honestly, I think I'd only be able to stay in the one day.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Yeah, I think we'll both go on Saturday.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
It'll be fine.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
I'll come with if you don't mind the extra room.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Go for it.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
All right.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
OLR car trip.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Anyway, short email from Salt Tech.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Hey, OLR, I was learning if anyone, including chat,

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
knows anything about whether Diablo 3 will be pay-to-play like World of Warcraft

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
or buy the game like Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 anyway.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
Love the show.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
I'm glad to hear you like the email address.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
It's actually supposed to be 666% pure evil,

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
but you can't use the percent character in email addresses,

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
so it ended up with being what it is now.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Keep up the great work.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Also, periods help.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
So far as I know, and this comes as a Blizzard fan,

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
it's going to be pay-once-and-play, just standard Battle.net model.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Why not?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Diablo 2 is the same way.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
I mean, if Blizzard were to change it now,

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
they'd just be getting greedy, bastards.

24:41.000 --> 24:45.000
But I don't think that's going to be the case.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
At any rate, next email is,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
hey, I'm sorry, dear OLR,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
hi, you guys are awesome.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
Anyway, I remember I was listening to you guys one time,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
how you said you can't find awesome arcades anymore, cry.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
But there's still one, kind of.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Well, I live in Houston, Texas, and we have this anime arcade.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
When I found out about this arcade, I was like,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
OMG, Houston has something cool?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
So I made my parents take me there with a friend,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
and we were all like, where is it?

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But just when we were about to give up, my mom was all like,

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
hey, is that it?

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
And I'm like, yes, it is.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
So we take a look inside, and my parents all confused

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
because they aren't otaku, and it was awesome.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
It was called Planet Zero.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
And I was so happy I almost cried

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
because they had imported games such as popin' music.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Yay.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
The only thing that really, really sucked was that the arcade was small,

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
but that's okay.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
It's still cool.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Well, thank you for taking the time to read this story.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
It's long.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
LOL, your friend Isabelle.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
But it's signed as ro.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Last email.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
It is a long one.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
All right.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Long email is long.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
But this one is special because of their ISP,

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
which I think is funny.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
I'm not going to say.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
Oh, we can't say the...

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Oh, okay.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.000
Well, actually, I'm pretty sure that the name is pronounced Nige

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
just as a nickname.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
All right.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
I always think about this one song that has the name

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
of this supermarket chain in the title.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Anyway.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
All right.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Read the email.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Fine.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Dear OLR,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
I finally had my first sustained encounter with the PSP last week

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
after years of getting my gaming fix on a Nintendo system.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
And I was very surprised how much I liked it.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
The public perception of Sony's computer entertainment strategy

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
at the moment generally seems to be one of the companies

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
suffering a midterm malaise, much like Nintendo went through

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
after the year of the 16-bit era until the Wii slash DS combo.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
As you always rightly say, it's all about the games.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
And although there were a handful of interesting titles in the PSP,

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
it never really grabbed my attention until Crisis Core arrived in Europe.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
As my girlfriend has a PSP, I decided to buy the game and give it a go.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
The game itself is very good.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
I have to disagree with Logie's comments a couple episodes back.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
I find it very entertaining.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Part of the reason for this personally, I feel,

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
is because I've been out of the Final Fantasy universe for so long.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
I played Final Fantasy Tactics on GBA,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
the Kratty Crystal Chronicles spin-offs,

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
and the Boring Revenant Wings game on the DS,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
along with some of the mundane remakes,

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
but not any of the console games since Final Fantasy IX.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
I really like the art style and the more fluid battle mechanics

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
that appears to have replaced the original turn-based system.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
I also think that the mission structure fits the portability of the PSP.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
I can pick up the game and play a mission for five minutes

27:37.000 --> 27:40.000
whilst in a shop or sitting on the toilet hem,

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
and then can put it down again.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
I had told you I keep a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the bathroom.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
When I'm ready to spend time with the story,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
then I can get bogged down in wasting an hour or two,

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
but when I'm ready.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Anyway, that's not my main point.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
Accessing the PSP has been like opening a shiny door in my head.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
That's nice.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
What a wonderful product.

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
With all that functionality, it really is a media center in your pocket.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
I guess it could be argued that Sony's insistence

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
on turning their game machines into home computers

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
may have been something of a flaw in their strategy,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
but then this is also the first week

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
that I have been listening to the OLR podcast

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
out in the sunshine on a PSP

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
before catching up on other RSS feeds

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
that I regularly check out on my desktop PC,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
which I couldn't do on my DS.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
And thank you for making us your first priority this week.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
There are pros and cons to any product in a competitive marketplace.

28:36.000 --> 28:41.000
The opportunity cost of the next best alternative

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
will always be subjective.

28:43.000 --> 28:49.000
However, with Nintendo's seemingly lackluster provision of mature,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
and by that design I don't necessarily mean emirated,

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
just intelligent grown-up design versus the likes of Imagine Baby's titles,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
and the lack of desire to provide choice,

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Goodbye Freeloader and region-free gaming,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
the historic poor strategic vision in PAL territories,

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
and of course the fact that we are seen to be geeks in Otaku,

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
I'm starting to feel marginalized by Nintendo,

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
who I once championed so much,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
it seems ironic that in the moment of their greatest commercial success,

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
I find myself completely disinterested by what they have to offer.

29:19.000 --> 29:25.000
It may have something to do with my age,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
and my gaming habits,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
but I am, or rather have been, a loyal customer,

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
and I do agree with you, and I'm not much older than you.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
My girlfriend, the PSP owner,

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
who fits the historic profile of a traditional European gamer,

29:38.000 --> 29:42.000
having been raised on PC and home computer gaming scene

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
in the late 80s and early 90s,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
rather than foreign consoles, asked Kropotkin for more info,

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
summed it up neatly for me recently.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
You were once their target market, but not anymore.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
I guess it really is that simple.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
What the Nintendo marketing executive said with their vision really is,

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
and I'm fine with that.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
They are opening up gaming to a broader audience,

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
making it socially acceptable lifestyle activity.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
You just have to look at all of those unrealistically happy generations of families

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
in their TV commercials to get a sense of that.

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
Who would have thought Granny would ever get so enthused by virtual puppies

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
and Sudoku puzzles whilst bonding with their grandchildren

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
on an expensive nuclear family vacation to an unspecified exotic location?

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
So why am I bothering to say anything at all?

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
I just want Nintendo to know that,

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
thanks largely to the production of the must-want titles

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
by their competitors and tepid treatment of their customer base,

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
a personal tipping point has finally been reached.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I'm in the market for a PSP Slim and a PS3 now.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
My Wii is gathering dust, my DS gets the occasional play,

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
and I think I'm not alone.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
Very interesting quote in there, something about,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
you were the target audience, but not anymore.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
It kind of hurts to hear, but I think your girlfriend's on to something with that.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Was that his quote or the girlfriend? I don't remember.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
But whoever said that is definitely on to something.

31:07.000 --> 31:12.000
Kind of sad, but I think something the hardcore gaming fans forget once in a while,

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
like, OMG, Nintendo, how could you screw us over like this?

31:16.000 --> 31:20.000
Well, it was so much better when it was 8-bit.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Well, it's not 8-bit anymore.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
We're not 13 anymore, you know?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
That was the last one I'm reading.

31:27.000 --> 31:32.000
And I'm sorry to everybody else that I skipped over, you know,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I had a shit ton of emails.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
But there's always next week. Mailbag at orangeontrudy.com.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Yeah, I'm leaving the ones I haven't read as unread.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
And maybe we'll post some on the forums and respond to them there, you never know.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
Maybe.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
We'll see.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
Alright, mailbag at orangeontrudy.com if you'd like to contribute to Dark Soccer's massive emails.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.000
There you go.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Alright, back to some gaming news, eh, Loki?

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
Yes. Well, let's see, there was an interesting rumor that came out this week.

32:00.000 --> 32:09.000
About a 60GB Xbox 360 Pro model that's supposedly going to be announced at E3.

32:09.000 --> 32:20.000
It's interesting because, you know, this is around the same time that we've been seeing retailer ads for a 20GB model being dropped down to $299.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
And, of course, as usual, this is a rumor.

32:25.000 --> 32:29.000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
And who knows if it's true.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
But yeah, I guess we'll just have to wait until E3 to see if it's true.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
But boy, wouldn't E3 be a really good time to announce something like this?

32:44.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah, that would be a very good time to announce something like this.

32:49.000 --> 32:55.000
And don't you think you'd have to tell all these people in advance what you're doing and just pray the news doesn't get out there like it has been?

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
Yeah, that would, you know, a lot of trust in the industry there.

32:59.000 --> 33:15.000
And, you know, it would really suck if it seems like some of these websites like Ars Technica would happen to leak an email that, you know, was sent out by Microsoft detailing exactly what they were going to be talking about at E3.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
Quandary.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Yes, that's really sad.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Really sad.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
But we're sure that that wouldn't happen, right?

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
That would never happen.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Not at all.

33:27.000 --> 33:34.000
But, you know, hey, these Microsoft rumors, they're never true.

33:34.000 --> 33:42.000
Well, now, something else we can either confirm nor deny, and really we're in the dark about this one, is Halo.

33:42.000 --> 33:55.000
Here's the interesting thing. It's an article that's being run on computer and video games, that website, and it's apparently also coming from Sarcastic Gamer, which is another podcast, and their own internal quote-unquote sources.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
Apparently there is a new Halo game that is going to be unveiled at E3.

34:00.000 --> 34:07.000
Here's the thing, though. It could be Peter Jackson's game, but the interesting thing about it, it will not have the Master Chief in it.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
So could the Halo franchise survive without Master Chief?

34:11.000 --> 34:19.000
I don't know. I forgot to mention, too, as part of that story, the 20 gig model is rumored to being phased out with this price drop.

34:19.000 --> 34:27.000
You may remember last year, I believe, when the 80 gig came out, they dropped the price of the 60 gig also for the PS3.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Same type of thing.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
But we would have no idea if that is actually happening.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
Yes, we would have absolutely no idea that something like that would actually be happening.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.000
Right.

34:37.000 --> 34:45.000
A question for our guests in the studio, since we haven't heard from you in a little bit. Could Halo work without Master Chief?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
Ask someone who fucking cares.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Alright, then.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
Well, they have Halo Wars, and I'm pretty sure Master Chief's not in that.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Why not?

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Tell a game about Cortana.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
A game centered around Cortana? Okay, maybe. Maybe. Alright, getting warmer.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Rama, any thoughts?

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
I could give two shits about Halo, really.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
You know what would be awesome? Red vs. Blue, the game.

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
That'll work. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
Rabble, rabble.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
I would play sister.

35:12.000 --> 35:18.000
They could do a Halo game without Master Chief, but that's like a Halloween movie without Jamie Lee Curtis.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
It's just destined not to be as good. Come on. Come on.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.000
Alright.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
That broke me.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
That broke you?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Yes.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.000
Syntax error.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
I think it would be with the Arbiter.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.000
Who knows? E3, we'll find out, but I can't believe that Halo would be a franchise.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
Microsoft would just like, go away into the sunset.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
It'll be back one way or another. We'll see.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
Well, this makes me plenty happy.

35:45.000 --> 35:54.000
A new zombie smacking mini game is coming out called The House of the Dead EX.

35:54.000 --> 36:02.000
It's zombie love, zombie rock, zombie bowling, zombie whacking, zombie shooting.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Zombie whacking?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Yep, some zombie love.

36:05.000 --> 36:18.000
But it's actually, I do believe, it has a lot to use the guns or this sort of pedal that's on it, like in Time Crisis.

36:18.000 --> 36:26.000
But it's an arcade machine, and it's also in a really cutesy, kind of bizarro, cel-shaded anime style.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
It's the cel-shaded, sort of like how House of the Dead 3 was, but it's just cute.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.000
Well, House of the Dead 3 was supposed to be cel-shaded anyway.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
But it's a light gun game, and it has pedal, and it's House of the Dead EX.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
Cute.

36:42.000 --> 36:48.000
I don't think zombies and cute should ever be in the same sentence, unless you have a knot in there, but...

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Yeah, I don't know.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.000
It sounds like...

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
And then will Ubi Bol be basing a new movie based on that too?

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
No.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Where the zombies are like in love?

36:56.000 --> 36:57.000
I'm thinking no.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
I think Ubi Bol will be a zombie in the game.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Don't go there. For the love of God, don't go there.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Maybe a boss. I think he should be a boss.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
There you go.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Zombies got talent, says his fan to listen to chat.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Now they're just doing all these zombie things in chat.

37:11.000 --> 37:19.000
Well, not to sound like, as Rob put it earlier, advertising for GameTap.

37:19.000 --> 37:26.000
But, GameTap is going to be putting up American McGee's Grimm pretty soon.

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
And one thing they're going to be doing that's a little bit different is that each episode will be free,

37:32.000 --> 37:37.000
or be a free download, and remain a free download for a 24 hour period.

37:37.000 --> 37:46.000
After that, each episode will go into GameTap's archives and be available to download individual for a yet to be determined price.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Where the fuck is Alice, by the way?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.000
We need an American McGee game. We need Alice.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Is that not on GameTap yet? I thought it was.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
I have not seen Alice on GameTap.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
It's probably coming. You can bet that if this game...

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
They're probably waiting until like a month before or something. We'll see.

38:02.000 --> 38:09.000
So, these will all... I guess the first one is going to debut on July 31st.

38:09.000 --> 38:14.000
And it's going to be called A Boy Who... A Boy Learns What Fear Is.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
Oh my. Sounds a little scary.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.000
Well, changing gears here and moving on to something completely different.

38:23.000 --> 38:32.000
You know when this music plays, the news is not going to be good, folks.

38:32.000 --> 38:38.000
You heard that when the Sony PlayStation 3 launched, you heard all sorts of crazy shit happen.

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
People were getting shot up in line. People were getting the Sony PlayStation 3 stolen from them right out of their hands.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.000
But now, kids, we have reached the lowest of the low.

38:49.000 --> 38:55.000
And it didn't even happen in the U.S. It happened in Australia.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
I thought everyone got along in Australia, but no, this is how horrible it is.

38:59.000 --> 39:07.000
Zach Tooey... I apologize if I mispronounce that, but Zach Tooey, unfortunately, he has a form of muscular dystrophy.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
And he is confined in a wheelchair for most of his life.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
He was able to get something from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

39:14.000 --> 39:19.000
And Zach opted to get a PlayStation 3 from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which, by the way, is a great charity.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
I've helped raise money for them before. They're a wonderful, wonderful charity.

39:22.000 --> 39:31.000
Here's the thing. The charity got him the PlayStation 3, got him the games, and this week, thieves broke into his home and stole everything.

39:31.000 --> 39:35.000
Jewelry, appliances, PlayStation 3, and all the games.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Fuckers!

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Maybe his wish was to be mugged.

39:39.000 --> 39:46.000
I don't think so. I think, uh, this is one of those things where I would say, this country's going to hell, but, uh, unfortunately, it didn't happen here.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
This world's going to hell. Congratulations, everybody.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
But then again, it's Australia. We didn't see that coming.

39:52.000 --> 39:57.000
No, no, no. There's a lot of nice people living in the land of upside-down-ness.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Yeah, you don't want to go there.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
I think, yeah, don't go there, girlfriend.

40:01.000 --> 40:10.000
All right. So, obviously, that's, uh, that's about 99 different ways of fucked up, and we will count them out for you right now.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
Or at least give you our FUs of the week.

40:14.000 --> 40:22.000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
This is fucked up!

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
That's Sakura.

40:26.000 --> 40:34.000
FU to the 580. And, um, FU to the asshole.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
You know, FU getting pulled over.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Snap.

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
I got pulled over at the, uh, Sacramento airport.

40:42.000 --> 40:49.000
Um, first of all, I was dead tired, exhausted after having driven most of the day and wandering all over the city.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
Well, all over Virginia County and Berkeley and all this.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
And we talked to the AMPM there, and I had to circle back around so I could actually get back there to get some coffee.

40:58.000 --> 41:06.000
And I ended up pulling out and going to the Garden Highway and some to the exit on the 5 going, you know, trying to find my way out.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
And I got pulled over, and my tags, um, need renewing.

41:10.000 --> 41:15.000
But they wanted to search the trunk and do all this stuff, and it turned out...

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Damn!

41:16.000 --> 41:20.000
It turned out that, um, they were looking for someone.

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
They were asking all of our IDs and checking everything, but they left me off in the morning.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
Were they looking for someone that looks like you? Of all things?

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
I don't know, but it was my evil twin Skippy.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Wow.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I like how you have an evil twin named Skippy.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Skippy Sakura. Dark Skippy.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Light Sakura. It was Light Sakura.

41:39.000 --> 41:50.000
No. But, um, but, uh, you know, one of the names for evil Sakura is Hiakeshika Sakura, which is lumber?

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Does Skippy have a mustache like Evil Spock?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.000
No.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Alright.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
No!

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Alright, I'm sorry. Anything else Dark Sakura?

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
Yes!

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Okay.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
You didn't give me a ticket. I got to go.

42:03.000 --> 42:11.000
And then we heard, we heard, uh, a sort of, uh, yelling fight at the Chevron station, which was stupid.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.000
Nice.

42:12.000 --> 42:19.000
I said, man, people, if you're going to argue with somebody and talk shit, no one else cares to hear your fucking nonsense.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
Go keep it to yourselves or talk somewhere like civil human beings and say,

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
That bitch!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
You know.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Be civil.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Be mature.

42:33.000 --> 42:36.000
I'm sorry. Game Guru corrected me. Evil Spock had a beard, not a mustache.

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
Sorry, nerd Trekkie. I'm just kidding.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
So rude.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
But, but, but, but, but, also, also one last thing.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
A semi-F you to the ending of Doctor Who.

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
The season ending of Doctor Who.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Because it was sort of a cop-out.

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
And it was, as a, as a fangirl, I did have my fangasm, and I'm sorry.

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
I want to look as good as Liz Sladen when I am 60 years old.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Because that woman is gorgeous.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.000
But, um, but it was, it was, it was a bit of happy at the end.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Just a little cop-y-outy.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
Just a little cop-y-outy.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
But I'm wondering, there's two people who are, I don't want to spoil it.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
I don't want to spoil it. I'm not gonna.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Just, ahhh!

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
Fangirlism.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Next.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Um, let's see.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
I would have said F you to, um, programming.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
But I don't have reason to do that anymore.

43:37.000 --> 43:41.000
Um, so I'm gonna say F you to my car being in the shop still.

43:41.000 --> 43:48.000
Um, unfortunately the, I guess, thermostat housing is, um, busted and leaking coolant.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
So I took it in on the 4th of July.

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
And, um, unfortunately the dealership was closed.

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
And they were unable to fix it.

43:59.000 --> 44:04.000
So now I have to wait for my car until Monday when the dealership is open.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
Because that's, um, the only place that has a part.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
So that sucks.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
Even though I could have driven my car, you know, leaking coolant, as I've been doing.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Ah, it might not have been, it might not have been fun.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
It was alright, but, you know, um, I just want to get it fixed.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Alright, let's keep the F yous moving.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
I'm gonna make mine quick.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
F you to drama.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
F you to unnecessary drama.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
It's sad.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Makes me pain in places I didn't know I had.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
Rama!

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Which rhymes with drama.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Rama drama.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
But that should be a podcast you should do.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Rama drama.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Rama does not rhyme with drama.

44:39.000 --> 44:44.000
I know, I'm just, in my real ghetto, don't know how to speak thing.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Okay, drama llama rama.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I'm going to let that one slide.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
You should have a podcast where you just talk about drama in the cosplay world.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
I bet it's hilarious.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Oh, I do slip some in there from time to time.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Alright, F yous of the week.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
I need to stop.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
F yous of the week.

44:59.000 --> 45:04.000
First, F you to people who have made my vacation a living hell that started off.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
I don't need to hear from you.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Leave me alone.

45:07.000 --> 45:10.000
Second F you to Continental Airlines.

45:10.000 --> 45:18.000
Yes, my friend will help me out, but still, I don't want to be stuck in Texas for nine hours.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Okay?

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
At George Bush?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
Yeah.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.000
What the hell?

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
And your luggage went to New Orleans, which sounds so much like Sacramento.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
But your luggage did come back from its early Mardi Gras, like Saw said.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Yeah, but the thing is, when I opened up the bag, there was no tequila, no alcohol, no nothing.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
That's an evil bag.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
Or boobs.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
Exactly, not even beads.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
I mean, really.

45:40.000 --> 45:45.000
All there was was, you know, parts of Hurricane Katrina and...

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
Boo, too soon.

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
No, dude, no.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Ah, fuck this heat.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Oh my god.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
Yeah, fuck the heat.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
I'm dying.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
I am dying, too.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Oh, sorry.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Oh.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
You gotta give him nice, loud, hearty, fuck the heat.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
Sorry, yeah.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
Fuck this heat.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
There you go.

46:04.000 --> 46:05.000
A little better.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
Alright.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Yeah, I'll second the fuck you to the heat.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
I'll second the fuck you to drama.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
Fuck you to Ubisoft for not making sure that a game works before they push it out the door.

46:14.000 --> 46:22.000
Speaking of, of course, Ghost Recon, Assault Warfighter 2, which decides to crash as soon as I load a level.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
FU not being able to drive yet, not being able to learn to drive yet, because of this heat.

46:27.000 --> 46:33.000
Because the car is way too fucking hot by the time I get in it, and it's been driven in a while, so fuck that shit.

46:33.000 --> 46:40.000
And just fuck waiting around for people to look at resume shit.

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
Driving me crazy.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
Alright.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
That's gonna do it for the FUs of the Week.

46:45.000 --> 46:50.000
It was kinda long tonight, but we had a lot of angst here in studio, which makes up for some of the weeks past where we didn't have that much angst.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
So there you have it.

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
But now we need to change the tone here in studio a little bit, because we got Match Game coming up, so I need something a little bit lighter fare.

46:57.000 --> 47:02.000
And believe it or not, of all people, I'm gonna turn to Jamie for something a little lighter fare.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
Death, death, blood, shit, and puke.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Not helping.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
And cornflakes.

47:09.000 --> 47:35.000
Okay. In actual news, I really have to give it to the male population of Canada, because there is a study that has come out, a survey actually that Microsoft put out, wondering how many, well out of a thousand gamers in Canada, how many of them play naked?

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
And this is something we really needed to know.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
This was like, you know, scientifically sensitive, you know, we need to know this information.

47:43.000 --> 47:52.000
17% of men game naked, and 9% of women game naked.

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
Like all the time, or just have once in a while? Or like have before?

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
I don't know, but get plastic wrap for your controller, please.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
So here's my question.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
They say this about Canadian gamers, but I'm wondering if it's true about American gamers.

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm wondering something here.

48:11.000 --> 48:17.000
I wonder if the people who took the survey counted, say, taking a handheld into the bathroom as gaming naked.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
I don't know about that.

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
It's a valid question. It's a valid question.

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
Okay, outside of the handheld in the bathroom, who has ever game naked? Darkside, have you ever game naked?

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
Yes, I have.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
Do you remember what game?

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
Well, first of all, I was running a fever of 103.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Okay.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
It probably wasn't DDR.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
No, it was actually Super Mario 3, I think. No, it was before that.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
I think it was Top Gun.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Nice.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Loki, have you ever game naked?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I always game naked under my clothes.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
No, really? No, really?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
No, no, I haven't.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Okay, so we're 50% so far.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
Romba, ever game naked?

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
Normally my lawyer would tell me not to answer, but yeah.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
And it was Dance Dance Revolution.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
That's the limit, no.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.000
Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Me too.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
Wait.

49:08.000 --> 49:13.000
When I was done, there was a bunch of fangirls outside wanting my autograph with the other pen.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
I didn't do it in a public setting.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
I'm sorry?

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
You have to try it.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
I was in my own house. I didn't know the window. I wasn't looking.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Close the shades.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
Alright, alright.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I denied a fangirl what they wanted.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
Drew?

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
Drew?

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
To make them want it more.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Drew, have you ever game nude?

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
I have to say, with all confidence, I have not. I don't plan to.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
I've lied naked in the bed playing PSP.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Alright.

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
Dark Tetsuya?

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
I know.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
But here, look at that.

49:45.000 --> 49:51.000
I just want to say, out of the studio, even though we're including men and women because dark soccer is here,

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
three of us have game nude, three of us have not.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
That means 50% of Americans have game naked, so take that Canada.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
That's why you can never trust a poll.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Take that.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
The numbers are manipulated by the ones who ask the questions.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
Alright. Anyhow, so there you have it.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
Now that we've thoroughly grossed out the chat room, Shadow Slider says, game naked. What kind of poll was this?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
That's my thoughts exactly. Why did this need to be asked?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Why does Microsoft care?

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Are they trying to do naked fun games?

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
GameGrew asks, is Jess wearing underwear?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I vote for more naked fun games.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
I'm all for naked Twister.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Naked is naked.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Naked is just naked.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
It's just naked.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
People are too bent up.

50:35.000 --> 50:39.000
Actually, this is actually sort of one of the things we talked about in my massage school,

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
about working on people's gluteal muscles.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
Don't be afraid. It's just a butt. You've got one too.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
And if they fart, they fart.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
I've had people fart on the table, Rob, and one of those people is in this room.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Nice. Alright.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I'm not naming names.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
Let's go to, while the comedy is still going here on Orange Launch Radio,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
let's go to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Launch Radio.

51:05.000 --> 51:09.000
That's right, guys. It's time for the OLR Match Game.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
And in order to play the match game tonight, we need contestants.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
So, folks in chat, if you want to play match game tonight,

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
say me once and only once.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
If you say it more than once, you're disqualified.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
You just say me period or no period.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Nothing else besides that.

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
If you'd like to play match game in our chat tonight, just say me.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
While I introduce tonight, celebrities playing tonight's match game.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
If you've never heard the match game before,

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
it's just like the old school game show, which is coming back, by the way.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Which I heard the news recently.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Oh, that's hardcore. That's awesome.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
It already did. It starts like in a few weeks on Comedy Central.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Awesome. Well, joining us tonight for OLR Match Game,

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
we have the one and only man right here from New York City.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
Say hello to DJ Ronda S.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
Hi, I'm DJ Ronda S. This is my first day of being sober.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Oh, sorry. This is not AA.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
All right.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
Say hello as well to Dark Tetsuya is here,

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
the man that actually updates at orangelandradio.com once in a while.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Yes, sir.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
All right. There he is.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Hard working as ever.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And also joining us tonight, Intern Drew.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Yo, what's up?

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
All right.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Loki is here as well.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
Yes, I am.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
And Dark Sakura.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Yo.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
And me.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
That's six opportunities to match tonight.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
Huge celebrity panels. Everybody's got something they can write with

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
or think their answer is at least in their head.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Okay, good.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
All right.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Rama, since you're our out-of-town visitor,

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
pick a number between one and 15.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
Seven.

52:35.000 --> 52:40.000
All right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Rapid Slasher is going to be our chatter tonight.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
If I didn't count that exactly, too bad.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
So I'm going to say, are you there?

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Make sure he can send me a private message.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Otherwise, he's cute.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
All right.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
So we have Rapid Slasher playing in chat tonight

52:54.000 --> 52:57.000
if he responds to my message.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Let's get somebody on the Skype line.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
He's got to play against somebody on the telephone.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
Our username on Skype.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So now I have to type to Rapid Slasher.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
Stand by to play.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Happy face.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
All right.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Skype line is open.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
If you want to challenge Rapid Slasher in tonight's OLR match game.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
And let's go to the phones.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
Who's this?

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
Hello, who's this on Orange Lounge Radio?

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
GS68, but it says...

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Are you there?

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
It's GS68.

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
Hi, GS68.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Can you hear us OK?

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Yep.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
All right.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Sounds good.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
Well, GS68, welcome.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Are you ready to play the match game against Rapid Slasher?

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
Yep.

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
All right.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Are you going to kick his ass?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Well, I don't know how long he's been listening.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
All right.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
Well, here it is.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
Do you know how to play GS68?

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
You know how the match game works?

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
Yep.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
So I'm going to explain anyway.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.000
We're going to read a sentence or a phrase, some type of topical sentence or phrase.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Somewhere in the phrase there will be a blank.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
OK?

53:58.000 --> 54:04.000
And it will be your job to match our celebrity panel here in studio with the best answer.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
OK?

54:05.000 --> 54:10.000
And you'll be playing against Rapid Slasher who will be submitting his answers in chat.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
OK?

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Sound good?

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Yes.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
You ready to play?

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
All right.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
Three questions tonight.

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Here is the first question.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Here it is.

54:19.000 --> 54:23.000
This past Tuesday was Canada Day!

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Happy Canada Day to all our Canadian Lizards!

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
This past Tuesday was Canada Day!

54:26.000 --> 54:32.000
To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would play all his games in the nude for

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
that day.

54:34.000 --> 54:42.000
The first game he played was blank.

54:43.000 --> 54:47.000
To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would play all his games in the nude for

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
that day.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
The first game he played was blank.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Celebrity panelists thinking about their answers.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Ding, ding, ding.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Dangia68 says, ding.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
Did everybody ding?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
All right.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Hold on. I'm thinking of my answer.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
I have my answer actually.

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
Okay.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
All right. So did everybody ding?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
Here in studio? Anyone still thinking?

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
We're waiting on RapidSlasher. He's got to send me an answer.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Send me

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
an

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
answer. And if you want to help our players out,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
you can always answer in the chatroom.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
chat.orangewonchradio.com

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
So if RapidSlasher hasn't thought of anything,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
you should take one of the

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
chatroom answers.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Let me turn down the music there. It was a little loud there. Sorry about that.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
All right.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Still waiting on RapidSlasher.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
If you can hear me,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
sir, please hurry up.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
Did he leave?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Is he still there? Oh, oh.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
All right. There we go. We got an answer. All right.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Here we go.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
GS68.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
This past Tuesday was Canada

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Day. To celebrate Canada Day, Rob

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
decided that he would play all his games in the

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
nude for that day. The first game he played

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
was?

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
The Guardian Legend. The Guardian Legend,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
says GS68. The Guardian

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Legend. All right. And RapidSlasher said

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
the first game he

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
played was Guitar Hero.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
All right. So we have The Guardian

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Legend, Guitar Hero. Let's see if we've matched anyone

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
on the panel. Rama S. What did

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
you say? Or is it just Rama now?

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Just Rama. Oh, sorry. Rama

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
no S. The first game he

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
played was? I said

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Rez. Rez.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Oh, Trans Vibrators?

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Yes or no?

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Oh, hell yes. Oh, hell yes. All right.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Can I get a hell yeah? All right. No comment.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
There it is, Rez. DarkTetsuya,

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
the first game he played was? I also

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
said Rez. Rez!

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Two people saying Rez in the studio. All right.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
The first game he played was?

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Imagine Babies.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
That's just wrong.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
That's very wrong. All right.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
Loki. So 0-0 so far.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Sorry GS68. Let's see if we get a match on Loki.

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Loki, the first game he played was? I said

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
MapleStory because, you know,

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
it's Canada Day, so

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Maple.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Boo.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Where's that Price is Right losing noise?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
All right.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
No, just kidding, Loki. That was funny.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
DarkSakura. You didn't say video game.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
No, I didn't say video game.

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
I said Whack-A-Mole.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
Whack-A-Mole.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Wow.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
All hail DarkSakura.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Wow.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Uh-uh.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
You haven't heard my answer yet.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
All right.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
So my answer this past

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Tuesday was Canada Day. Did I say

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Guitar Hero or Rez, or not Rez,

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Guitar Hero or Guardian Legend? Let's see.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
play all his games in the nude for that day.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
The first game he played was

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
BeatMania.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
That was my second choice.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Hello.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
BeatMania.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
2DX.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Right Side Pride, yo.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
That's not right.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
That explains the firm handshake.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
All right.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
There you have it.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Welcome to the match game.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
All right.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
GS68, I'm sorry, it's still 0-0.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Are you ready to match

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
on this next one? Yes.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
All right, GS68 says yes. Here we go.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Next question.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Loki recently

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
confessed to a big crime.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
He

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
When

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
the police asked him to confess,

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
he confessed. Yes, I

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
did it. I hacked PlayStation.com

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
because the website

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
didn't have enough blank.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
Fucking ding.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Loki hacked PlayStation.com

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
and said yes, I did it. I hacked

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
PlayStation.com because the website didn't

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
have enough blank. Ding.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
We're done.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I'm still thinking.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Um, dang.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
You should already have this since you wrote this question.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Yeah, that doesn't mean I have an answer.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Name this question

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
in the form of a walrus.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
All right, I'm

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
going for that one. All right.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
It sounds like everybody's dinged.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Oh, I didn't copy paste the question to RapidSlasher.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Shit, he's probably still thinking.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Bad host, no cookie.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Please

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
hurry.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Because I'm slow that time. All right.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Back with the music. Well, RapidSlasher,

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
thanks. Loki recently confessed to a big

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
crime. He was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
When the police asked him

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
to confess, he confessed. Yes, I did it.

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
I hacked PlayStation.com because the website

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
didn't have enough. All right, we got

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
an answer from RapidSlasher. So,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
GS68, the website didn't

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
have enough pylons.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Cylons.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Oh, pylons.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Sorry, I thought he was going for an old O-L-R in jokes.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Pylons. Didn't have enough pylons.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
RapidSlasher said it didn't have

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
enough tits.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Old standby answer. All right,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
there we go. So, pylons and tits.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Rama, the website did not

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
have enough prawn.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Prawn.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Not a match with tits. Not a match with tits.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Prawn is not tits.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Prawn is wannabe tits. All right.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Darktitsuya, the website didn't have enough

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Iraqi suicide

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
babies. Iraqi suicide

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
babies, says Darktitsuya.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Drew, by the

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
way, for those that are new to the O-L-R,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Iraqi suicide babies, like that's a match game joke

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
dating back to like episode 30.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
All right. Drew,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
the website did not construct

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
additional pylons. Oh,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
pylons. Wow, that's a match. I don't get the joke.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
What's the joke? It's a Starcraft joke.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Oh, my God.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
The guy that made the over 9,000

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
oh, my God. All right.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Well, shit, that's a match. Congratulations.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
GS68 is on the board with a point. That's a

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
match for pylons. All right. Loki,

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
the website did not have enough

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
cleavage. Cleavage. Is that

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
a match with tits, judges? No, because

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
cleavage is the... It's

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
a match.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
It's a match. I will say a half

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
point. A half point for rapid slasher.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
A half point. A half point for

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
rapid slasher. Hey, S, I am the only person in this room

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that possesses said substance.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
All right.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
There you go. DarkSakura, he

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
didn't have enough fuck?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
PlayStation.com didn't have enough

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
fuck?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
All right.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Needs

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
meat making fuck about

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Resurka. All right, and my answer,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
the website didn't have enough

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Iraqi suicide babies.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I also went with the old stand by OLR joke.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
All

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
right, could have gotten you two points, but there you have it.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
All right. One more

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
question. A chance for rapid slasher to

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
take over the lead. Are you worried, GS68?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
No.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I think

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
that was a no. It was very quiet. All right.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Here we go. Question number

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
three, and it's the last one, so

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
your last chance to make

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
a lot of points. Here we go.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The question is,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Jamie is very happy

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
to finally see an evil

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
woman robot appear in the new

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Mega Man game. However,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
she was very disappointed to hear about the name.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Splash Woman,

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
she exclaimed, screw that.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
If I made an evil robot,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
it would be Blank Woman.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Ding.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Jamie was very happy to see an evil woman

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
robot appear in the new Mega Man game,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
but she doesn't like the name Splash Woman. She said,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
if I had an evil robot, it

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
would be Blank Woman.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Ding.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Ding.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Ding.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
All right.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I'm waiting for rapid slasher's

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
answer. Everybody in the studio good to go?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Everybody in the studio looks good.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
We're just waiting on our

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
chatter.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Whistling.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Chatter, if you need help,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
there's tons of answers in chat right now.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I like some of

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
these answers. By the way, some of the

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
answers we have for the previous one,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
on the website,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
website didn't have enough eye

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
of judgment, worthwhile

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
content,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
porn, hentai,

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
super bacon, website

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
didn't have enough shots, that's a good one, that would have been a good one.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
All right, and then the

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
other one, the first game I was going to play

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
naked, Captain Commando.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
I like that one, says

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Shauran. Boom Blox,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Texas Hold'em.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
All right,

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
it looks like we have an answer from

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Rapid Slasher, so GS68,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
you have to answer first because you're on the phone.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
If I made an evil robot,

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
her name would be...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Dick Woman.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Sorry, say that one more time?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Dick Woman.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Did I hear that right? Dick Woman.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
All right.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
All right, Dick Woman.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I think that might defeat the point of being a woman, but we'll see.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
You never know. All our listeners have come up with

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
crazier things and matched.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Rapid Slasher says if I made an evil robot, it would be

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Ferret Woman.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
All right, getting a little warmer

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I think. Let's see, Ferret Woman

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
and Dick Woman. Rama,

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
if I made an evil robot, says

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Dark Soccer, the name would be...

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I said Guinness Woman.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Guinness Woman.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Very well done. Very well done.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That's a good one. All right, Dark Tetsuya, her name would be...

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
A bit cliche, but

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Bionic Woman. Bionic Woman.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Why not? Her name is Jamie Summers. Why not?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Good answer. Good answer. All right,

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Drew, the name would be...

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Ferret Woman. Ferret Woman. Oh my

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
gosh, a match. And with that,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Rapid Slasher takes the lead to

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
one and a half versus one. All right,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
let's see. Loki,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
the evil robot's name would be...

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Bitch, get back in the kitchen and make me dinner.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Woman.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I don't think Dark

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Sakura would actually say that. I think it might

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
be wrong, but I...

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Whoa, we...

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Uh oh, we just had Crash Bang Boom

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
live in the studio. That's all right.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Man down. I heard Broken

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Glass. That can't be good.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Uh oh, what?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Oh, fun. That's all right.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Dark Sakura.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Wow, that's crazy. Did you hear that on Justin

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
TV? That's something else. Dark Sakura, her name

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
would be... Woman. She doesn't

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
need anything else.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That's all you need to know.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That would be pretty

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
evil.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
All right, I got the finger.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
All right, here it is in my answer. Here it is.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
If I said Dick Woman, then GS68

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
wins. My answer,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
if I made an evil robot,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
her name would be... Sniper

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Woman. Sniper Woman.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Which, unfortunately, is not a match, which means

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Rapid Slasher wins

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
in a narrow victory of one and a half to

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
one. GS68,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I'm sorry you're the loser

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
tonight. So, uh,

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
is there any final words you have?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I am already...

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Oh, sorry, you get hung up on because you lost.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
All right. Hey, that's what the

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
losers get. I'm sorry. Poned.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Oh, come on. GS68's been on the show a

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
million times. Nothing, nothing there.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
He knows the rules. Rapid Slasher,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
if you have anything you want to plug,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
send me a private message and I will

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
plug it. As the winner, you get to plug

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
whatever you want. Meanwhile, Loki's

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
going to get to the next story while I assess the

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
damage. Yes. Of the party

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
foul. Uh, there is another

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
rumor of a game coming out now

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
for, I believe, the PSP.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
And, uh, this would make

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
sense, um, since,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
well, they've had other

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
similar collections on the PSP

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
as well. It is the Star

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Soldier collection. It's supposed to

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
contain, um,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
four different Star Soldier games,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
including Star Soldier,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
um, let's see,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Final Soldier and

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Soldier Blade. And

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
one other one, um, oh,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Super Star Soldier, I guess, as well.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
So that's kind of

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
cool. Oh, I'm sorry. And, um,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I got this all wrong here.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier, Soldier Blade,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
and Star Parodia.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Star Parodia?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And it would retail, I guess,

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
in Japan for, uh, 2940 yen,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
which is less than, uh,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
30 dollars US.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
I do want this. Star Parodia is, like,

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
the best game ever. Haven't, like, done

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Star Parodia on a classic

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
game? Uh, possibly.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I think you did one form of Parodius or another.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I don't know if it was that specific one. No, it's not Parodius. It has nothing to do with Parodius.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
My bad. Star Parodia is a parody of

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Star Soldier. That, I don't think you've done.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I'm all about Star Soldier myself, so

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
do want.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Alright. Sounds pretty awesome.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It's funny, though, because on the little screen shot that they have

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
or box shot or whatever it is, they have a bunch of

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
the Bomberman guys running around.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Alright.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I never saw RapidSlasher send, uh, something he

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
wanted to plug in private message, so, uh,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I guess, uh, that's that.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
We'll see. Maybe after this story.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Uh, Burnout Paradise, this is

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
one of those games I played for a couple days and I was like,

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
eh, I'm over it, which is sad because

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Burnout was, uh, such a fun series, but

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
you know, hats off to the

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
folks at Criterion because they keep trying to

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
invent new ways to make the game more fun.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Uh, granted they had a patch of theirs get pushed

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
back a little bit, but guess what's

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
coming for the next patch? This is very

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
interesting. Um, Criterion

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
is considering after this whole Cagney update

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
is done, they're gonna put planes

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
in Burnout Paradise.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Yes. Planes.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Like pilot wings. Planes.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
I'd like, I'd like to see an airborne

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
takedown. That could be very

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
interesting, but I worry about

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
all the fan videos on YouTube we're gonna see.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I want free running to be in there.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I want people just running and then

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
running into other people and that,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
that's what's gonna happen. They're gonna explode and

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
like crash. I will say though, referring

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
to an earlier story in the evening, um,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
it would be pretty awesome to fly the

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
plane in Burnout Paradise, uh, with a

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
custom soundtrack playing Danger Zone.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It's getting ridiculous

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
now, seriously. Danger Zone.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Alright, maybe not. You know, Hamster. It's gonna

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
be Hamster and Hamster Bowl and it's, you know,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
right across the street. Don't, don't

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
give them ideas. Please don't give them ideas.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Alright, we got one more story for

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
you and then the Skype line will be open

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
at 1877 Game OLR. Our username

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
having the last word tonight on the news,

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
DarkSakura. Hells yeah,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I am. Um,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
one of the, uh,

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'd have to say best RPG series ever,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Let Me Untangle Myself.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It's not called Let Me Untangle Myself.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
That would be a pretty fun RPG. Um,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
it's a fantasy star

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
and they're doing a fantasy star portable.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
There's a demo that is

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
actually, um, out, um,

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
uh,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
let me see if I can find it. Yeah, on

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
the official website, I do believe, at

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
fantasystar.sega.jp

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
slash psp. Um,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
that's got new characters and, uh,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
some downloadable content and

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
the demo is going to be out on July 14th

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
and the game will be out on the 31st, but

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that is Japan only.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Um, and it will be 301 megabytes

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
in size.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Sounds interesting. The demo, sorry.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Could be fun. It's supposed to be,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
as I say, an extensive demo.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
You can access story

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
mode and multi-mode.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Alright. And you can bring your, um, save data

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
from the demo to the final game.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Alright. I got the

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
plugs from Rapid Slasher before, uh,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
we get to tonight's Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Uh, Rapid Slasher would like to plug his YouTube

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
channel, available at YouTube.com

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
slash user slash Rapid Slasher.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
And I'm looking at it right now. It looks like he has a two

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
girls, one cup reaction video.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Oh, those are always fun. It looks like,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
looks like, uh, friend is watching it

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
on a cell phone there or something. So there you have it.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
And a video called Chewbacca, which,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
um, I can only imagine what that is.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Stop it.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Rapid Slasher would also like to say, Indiana

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
represent, and go see Radiohead

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
this summer.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Radiohead. Alright.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
I didn't know Radiohead was going out on tour.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
They have an album out.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
They have a Rainbows album. Dark Sakura, we might have to

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
go do that. I love Radiohead. I'm thinking that.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Except Thom Yorke is nuts.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Alright. Look, before we get to the Skype line tonight,

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
we have a very special late-breaking

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
report, like live stuff going on right now.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Um, we're going to our OLR correspondent

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
who's on the line. Are you there?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yeah. How's it going, guys?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Good. Who is this?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
This is DJ Tyrant. Well, hello, DJ Tyrant.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Uh, folks around these parts might

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
remember you from STFU,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
which once aired on the Orange Lounge back when it was

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
a network. Yeah, that was

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
a lot of fun. Which feels like so long ago

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
now. It's so sad. But DJ Tyrant

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
still does some freelance stuff for us and uses

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
our name to get into places. So, uh,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
what did you use our name to get into

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
this week?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Uh, I went to Anime Expo, which actually just

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
ended today, and I just got

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
home about an hour ago.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And I got to play some games that aren't

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
out yet. Got to check out some stuff.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Okay, first question I've got to ask.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Anime Expo gets a little bit of a bad

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
rap out there in the community.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
I've never been, so this is not a personal

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
enti- That's okay, it sucks. But all I've

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
ever heard is it sucks. Anime sucks.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Suckspo. Anime, you know.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Does it still suck, or do you

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
think people might need to pay at another visit?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
I think people might

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
need to pay at another visit, because they've restructured

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
a lot of the upper people,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
and it seems a lot more organized

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
now. Did it suck as bad

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
as last year, as DarkSira?

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Oh no, it was- it was

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
much improved over the last year. I heard that that thing could suck

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
as badly as last year has ever sucked.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Last year was pretty bad.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
In order to come up, you've got to hit rock bottom

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
first, so there you go. Rock bottom. There it is.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Yo, how many, uh, rabid

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Odon Host Club fangirls did you have to

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
push your way through to get to the games?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Uh, too many.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Let's talk about games. What type of video

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
game stuff did you see at Anime Expo?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Uh, lots and lots of fighting games,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
because that seems to be pretty much 90%

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
of any anime video game.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Fair enough.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Were there lots of fighting games based on

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
animes, like any particular ones that jump out in your mind?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Uh, yeah, well, the typical

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Naruto games. Namco had their

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
PS3 Naruto game,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
and that looked really good. The graphics were really

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
nice on that. Um, and D3

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
had their Wii

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Naruto fighting game, and

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
so that's probably not going to be

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
that great, because

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
it's on the Wii, and Wii fighting games

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
generally are not that great. What was that, Logan?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I was going to say, which, by the way, if you want to play the demo for the

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
PS3 one, you can download the second episode of

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Core, and they have an

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
exclusive demo in there. Huh. Are you

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
subscribed to Core? No, but I read it. Oh, sorry.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
I ain't buying that. What the hell?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It's not stupid. Sorry, Jimmy. What else

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
was there? Uh, I went to

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
actually Arc System Works

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
panel, which does Guilty Gear,

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
and they showed off

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
a couple trailers for some games that are

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
coming out. Uh, Castle Sh-

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Shikigami 3, which is a Wii

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
title, it's, uh, another

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
one of those shumps. Yeah, it's, uh,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
really beautiful.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
And it looks a lot like

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Ikaruga.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
That was, like, fun. Were there any non-fighting

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
games there? Or was that, like, all you saw?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Um, that was all that was

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
pretty much playable. I mean, so Calibur IV was

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
playable. It looked really,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
really beautiful. Wow.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Street Fighter IV? Did you get some h-

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
Yeah, Street Fighter IV? Uh, Street Fighter-

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Capcom was not there, so Street Fighter IV was

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
not there. Well, tell us more about Soul Calibur IV.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Did you get some hands-on play with Soul Calibur IV? How was it?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Uh, no, I didn't,

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
but it looked pretty much

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
like a standard Soul Calibur game. I mean,

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
there were only three playable characters, none

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
of the exclusives, no Darth Vader or Yoda

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
or, uh, Kratos, just kidding.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Haha, funny.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Yeah, um, another one

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
from Arc System's work was Battle Fantasia,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
which I got to spend some time with.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It's, um, another

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
fighting game, but it's exclusive for the

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
360. It'll have, uh,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Xbox Live Play coming out, I think,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
September 16th, they said.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
There is a PS3 version. Very similar to

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Third Strike in that there's, uh,

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
a parry system in it.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
You hit the R1 shoulder

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
button, and the next attack is parried.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And if you do it and there's

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
no attack, you, there's kind of a

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
cooldown from when you can attack again.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Yeah, I know there is a PS3 version

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
of that, because I'm actually trying to get a friend

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
right now who's over in Japan to import it

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
for me, but, um, I'm surprised

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
they're not localizing that. Probably paid

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
exclusively. Uh, yeah, that came up a lot during

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
their panel. Everyone was like, are you bringing it over for

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
a PS3? And they haven't made any

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
announcements yet for that.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Um, they also

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
showed a trailer for that, uh,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
what was it? The, the

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Phoenix Wright style game that Jack

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Hunter, and that was

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
kind of funny to see that, because it looks

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
almost exactly like, uh,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Phoenix Wright. Did you see, uh,

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Blue Blaze Calamity Trigger?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Yeah, I saw the game, and

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
the line was just huge for it. And it

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
looks very similar to,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
uh, the Guilty Gear XX series.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Um, has the same style of gameplay.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
And,

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
um, there's a blocking system in it

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
that I, I got to check it out.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And on that top bar, if you

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
played Street Fighter Alpha 3,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
there's a, there's a guard meter where you can

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
only guard so much. Um,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
and it's separate in that game, but in this game,

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
both people share it, so I can see

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
some strategies playing out because of that.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
I, I'm a little surprised that you didn't

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
see more, like, RPGs,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
MMOs from little companies,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and all that kind of stuff at all. I, I saw

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
a ton of the little MMOs, I mean,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
uh, MapleStory, um,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
they got me to sign up for that. I'll

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
check it out. Sucker. Probably.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Yeah. Well, they gave me $10

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
in free, uh, um,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
nickel and

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
dime-ing DLC or whatever it is.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Was it worth selling your soul?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I, I hadn't sold my soul yet.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Alright.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Yet. Keyword. Alright.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Uh, Jimmy, before we

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
let you go, we gotta know, thank you for giving us

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
the fill on what we miss on Anime Expo, but I gotta know,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
best cosplay and

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
worst cosplay? Oh, yeah.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Oh, boy, uh,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
my favorite cosplay

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
is probably a Captain Falcon that looks

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
pretty, pretty darn good.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
I thought it was pretty funny. Nice.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Um, worst cosplay?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Um, any of the, the females

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
that really didn't need to be

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
in skimpy outfits?

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Oh, god. There you have it.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
I mean, you have that at every con, though, so,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I don't know. Alright.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's just not appealing.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Alright. David Hader's awesome.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I assume that no cosplayers got

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
shot being in LA?

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
No. I don't know why everyone assumes that.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I'm shocked.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Alright, well, uh, DJ Tyrant,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
I'll see you at BlizzCon. We're in a nicer area.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Yeah, definitely. It'll be a blast.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
It will. Alright. Take care,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Jimmy. Thanks, guys. Take care.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Thanks for being on the show.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Alright, we like hearing from Jimmy, and I'm glad he has a place

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
to come on and talk, sadly, because STFU

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
is no more. It's sad.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But there is, uh, STFU is kind of combined

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
now. You know, you got half of STFU.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
You got DMN, and you got Travis Donovan.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
They do a show together here on

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
All Games Radio. It's Understation Live. It airs

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Saturday nights, and it was the show I started on

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
years ago, and Dark Soccer was a guest

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
like 50 million times.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
So, there you have it. Alright, if you want to give us a call,

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, and

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
it's already ringing. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Hey, this is the

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
other New Yorker, SSJ100 Matt.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Well, hello, SSJ100 Matt, and you see

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I switch shirts during the break.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I don't know if you're looking to just TV right now, but I've got

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
the I Heart NY shirt on right now,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
just for you cats. There you go.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Yo, what's up, Matt? Yeah, if I got a Sharpie,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
I can write IN BED underneath it.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
The whole town. No, what's on your mind, SSJ100 Matt?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
What was that?

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
What is on your mind tonight?

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Nothing. I'm

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
pretty hyped up about, uh, the greatest game

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
ever made, uh,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
um, well, according not

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
to you, and not according to you,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
but, uh, Chrono Trigger.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Chrono, no, you're right, not according to me,

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
but I still think it's pretty darn good, and, uh,

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
you know, not even as good as some of the Final Fantasy

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
games I've played, but that's alright.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Even I will probably get the

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Chrono Trigger remake on DS. There was this, like,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
collective explosion of fan

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
gasm on the internet this week when that was announced.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
That was pretty crazy. So, uh,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
it's just like my Live Journal friends list exploded,

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
and I'm sure people's Twitters, uh,

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
blew themselves up as well. Um,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
what would you, as a Chrono Trigger,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
um, fan, uh,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
really want to see in this, uh,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
new DS version, Matt?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Well, I assume, you know, it's gonna

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
be based on, like, the SNES

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
version, but, um, I think, you know, just

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
keep everything the way it was,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and, uh, I think they said they were gonna

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
add more dungeons and online

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
play. That's fine with me.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
So, I mean, I beat the game

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
10,000 times

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
since it's come out, so...

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
What would you have thought, Matt, if

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
it turned out that this game was a 3D remake

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
in the same vein as Final Fantasy 3 and

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Final Fantasy 4? Would you have been a little scared, or what?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I probably would have been a little scared,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
and I probably still would have bought it.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Still would have bought it, just to

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
support Chrono Trigger, but a little

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
bit apprehensively.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
You know, maybe if we buy, if we each

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
buy 50 copies, they'll make, uh, Radical

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Dreamers, or some sort of

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
dream on. Yeah, dream

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
on with that one. You never know. You never know.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Stranger things have happened, so there you have it.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Well, I, um, I

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
have my fingers crossed that Chrono Trigger

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
will do the fans justice. I have not

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
played the game in so long. I haven't played Chrono Trigger

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
since I was a kid, so it'll be fun to revisit

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
that series. You know what, it's good

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
because, you know, a lot of the younger

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
generation who, like, were born in the 90s,

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
they'll actually get a chance to play this, because, you know,

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
I'm sure there's plenty of people in the chat room

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
who've never played it before, so...

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
I am kinda curious, though, how the whole two-screen

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
thing's gonna work. I'm very curious

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
to see what they do with that, so, uh, we'll be waiting

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
for, uh, some more screenshots and stuff.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
If they make it 3D, they better do it justice.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
They're not. It's Sprite. It's old-school

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Sprite. Alright.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Well, Matt, thank you so much for calling in. Any other last words

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
you wanna say real quick?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Well, yeah, two things. Um, when, when are you guys

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
coming out to New York again?

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Tough to say.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
I'm gonna aim for the spring,

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
because I do wanna see my friend that lives out there.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
It's not gonna happen for digital life. I'll tell you that much

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
just because of Penny Arcade Expo and everything else.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
But I'm gonna aim for spring.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
That's cool.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
So, we'll see.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
What's the second thing?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Uh, this is for, uh, dark to see you.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Sir?

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
What?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Wait a minute. When have I heard that before?

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Sounds familiar. Alright.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Later, Matt. For that, you get hung up on it.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Alright.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
We've got room for about, how long are we running this?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Ooh, shit, we're almost to an hour and a half.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Maybe, like, one more call on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
1-877-GAME-OLR

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Sack anime a little closer to home

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
last week of August. Be there.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Oh, it's, it's Penny Arcade Expo.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Same weekend. Can't do it. Sorry, guys.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Sorry.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Fine. I'll go.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
They do, like, five sack animes a year.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
They do two.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
There seems like there's a con at the Masonic Center every month.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
They have two sack animes a month

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
and, sorry, two sack animes a year

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and four sack animes a month.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I wish. And, uh,

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
four smaller sack comic cons

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
a year. Alright.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Thank you for the local news.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Do it. I love Sunrise Mall. That's awesome. Alright.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Here we go. Look. We'll stop, stop with the local chat.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Let's talk to somebody on the Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Who's this?

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Oh, hi. Um.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
I spaced out there for a sec. This is Golden Banjo.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
That's alright. The heat is making us spacey, too,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
but it's starting to cool off a little bit, thank God.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Actually, it's not as bad over here in New England

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
and New Hampshire, but

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
I feel bad for you guys.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
That's alright. You guys have to deal with humidity.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
At least we don't have that. Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Um, well, actually,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
I'm one of those Chrono Trigger people

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
and, uh, well, once again,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
I know you might not be as crazy about it.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I don't actually even know

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
much about the game and I know

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
that I have to play it.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
So, that just goes to show you.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
No, that's fine.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I'm about 16, so.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
See, I think that's what it is. So, you were probably,

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
like, when these games first came out, God, if I was, like,

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
16 when those games came out, then you were, like,

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
one or two when those games first came out.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
God, I'm old.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I think that's the whole thing that Matt was saying earlier,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
is that this will really allow a whole new generation

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
to experience it, which is kind of cool.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So, it's kind of interesting. They're not changing

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
a whole lot and modernizing it, but I guess with the classic,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
you don't have to. I mean, you don't modernize old movies.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Then again, sometimes Turner

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
colorizes them and all that stuff.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
But, yeah, it'll be interesting.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
And I don't hate Chrono Trigger by any means.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Just because I didn't name it my favorite game of all time

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
doesn't mean I hate it.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
There's other games I like a little more,

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
but I also really like Chrono Trigger

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
quite a bit and I respect it as

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
a great RPG game.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So, no hatin' in this camp.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
No hatin'.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
And to the new generation, do it or I'll come over the

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
internet and kick your ass.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
New generation, ugh.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
So old.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Go Banjo, anything else you want to share with

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
our listeners tonight?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
No, I just wanted to call in and say that real quick.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Alright.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Alright, that's pretty much it.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Have a good night, guys.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
You too, have fun with Chrono Trigger DS whenever it comes out.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Probably will be the hardest.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Okay, I'm definitely looking forward to that.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Call back and let us know what you think, young whippersnapper.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Okay, you too.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Alright, get off my lawn.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
He hung up. Okay, bye.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Alright, nice.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Very nice. Alright, we're gonna

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
go ahead and close up the Skyblind for tonight

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
so we can close out the rest of the show.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Big sorry and boo-hoo to those of you

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
who didn't get through, but please try again next week.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Quickly, before we close out tonight, some last

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
minute stories. Dark Soccer, you have anything

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
tonight? Sometimes you have some tidbits

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
for us? It's hot.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Yes, Hot Garage is very hot, but thankfully

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
it's cool. It's getting a little more bearable in here now.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Loki, any last minute stories

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
from you tonight?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
I've

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
never really been looking at

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
stories, unfortunately, because I've been too busy

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
working on stuff.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Let's see here.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Trying to see if there was anything we missed.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Real quick.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I tried to hit on all the big stuff tonight. I don't think there was anything we missed.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Yeah. I hope not.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
I'll be sad.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Oh, I know one thing that we didn't talk about.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They're actually...

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I'm not sure if this is really headway, you'd really

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
call it, but someone's gotten

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
homebrewed run a little bit

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
on a PS3 using

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Swap Magic.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And apparently they had

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
an elf loader on there that

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
they were able to run

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
a Genesis emulator.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So that's kind of

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
interesting. On what now?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
It's a program called Swap Magic.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
It was like one of those things to run

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
on PlayStation 3.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
You know, run, I guess, burn games

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
and stuff like that, or region-free stuff

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
on the PlayStation 2, but they

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
ran it on the PlayStation 3

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
and were able to play a Genesis emulator on there.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
I mean, sure, you could run Linux

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
or something like that on your

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
other operating system on that and

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
easily run games that way, but

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
that's not as fun.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
So, that was one thing that was

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
kind of interesting.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Let's see.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Also, the

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Wrath of the Lich King beta signups

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
are open.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Don't tell people because I want the key.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Well, actually, speaking of

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
things we missed, if you were

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
an UruLive fan,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
a Missed Online fan,

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
on GameTap, they are pulling

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
that, the publishers are taking it back

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
and apparently going to revive the community.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Oh, good for them.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
That's good. There was definitely a community

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
behind it.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
There you have it.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
We've got some other things here real quick.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Bomberman is coming to

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
the iPhone with Bomberman Touch,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
which is interesting.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
also,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I guess a game, the UK

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
retailer is going

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
to start publishing some independent games.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Which is

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
weird. That's interesting to have a retailer

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
doing that at the front like that.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Exclusives. Can you say exclusives?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And Sony, I guess, is putting out

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
another game that's going to be

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
coming out in

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
September, called Aqua.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And it's

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
a sequel to Aquanauts

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Holiday, which is sort of

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
like Endless Ocean on the Wii.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So think of Africa, but under the sea.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
And it looks

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
pretty cool, actually.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
Also, there is a rumor that

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Golf T it Up is

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
next week. Whatever the hell that's

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
supposed to be. But apparently it has its

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Xbox.com page now, so

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
that's on there. As well as, I guess,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Pirates vs Ninja's

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Dodgeball. About time.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And then there's also a Guitar Hero

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
homebrew game that's supposed to be coming out

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
towards the

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
end of August, August 20th.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
It's called Video Game Hero.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Two of the tracks that they have on there,

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Eye of the Tiger and Inspector Gadget.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
It's the Inspector

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Gadget theme, which both of them

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
sound kind of like

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
very midi

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
sounding. But

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
the game uses the touch screen

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
or the directional buttons. It's kind of

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
like Oda Jam, almost.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Which would be something else good to bring to the

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
DS. Very interesting.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Alright. Well, that's going to do it

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
for Last Minute Stories tonight, and we're about

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
ready to wrap up the show. So, guys,

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
thank you so much for coming to the show tonight and being here.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
And we'll start off with the final thoughts.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Intern Drew, you have a final thought?

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Can we wrap up the show in an air-conditioned

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
box? We can try.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Alright. Dartitsuya, any final thoughts?

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
One second.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Uh-oh.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
What the hell is that?

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Nice.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
That little

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
keychain thing.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Rama,

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
your final thought?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
It's a Cyberman. You were wrong.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
It's a Cyberman.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Rama, your final thought?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Google Maps on my phone with

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
GPS has been making me uber geek

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
this entire weekend.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Geek. Nerd.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Damn proud of it.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
My final thought is...

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
um...

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
hot. Dark Sakura.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Exterminate the heat.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Loki.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Hot chair is hot.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Alright.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
That's going to do it for another episode of

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Orange Laundry. Thanks so much for tuning in to us.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And remember, hey, we braved the heat.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
We do this every week for

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
you guys, the listeners, for free.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
We don't get anything from doing this, contrary to popular

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
belief. Nothing. We don't get paid by all games

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
or none of that. It's

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
all completely free for you guys. All we ask,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
guys, if you enjoy our show, tell somebody.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Spread the word. Tell two friends about

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
the show. Post a nice review on iTunes.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Put something in your signature or something.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
That's all we ask. And a lot of you have done that.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Thank you guys so much for that.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
And thanks to that, independent

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
internet radio will continue to live on.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
We suffer for your entertainment.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Do it.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
For another 286 episodes,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
we hope. Unless we pass out first.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So until next week,

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
pray for a

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
rainstorm or some windstorms,

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:36.000
and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Right, anyway.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:26.000
See you next week.
