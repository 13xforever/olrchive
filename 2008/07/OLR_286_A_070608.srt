00:00:14,073 --> 00:00:25,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Tonight, July 6th, 2008, a 16-bit RPG classic is being redone for the DS, Rock Band 2 leaks hit the internet, and could a popular racing game soon take on airplanes?

2
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:42,301

00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:47,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:48,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

7
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:49,423
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Jamie?

8
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:50,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

9
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:52,523
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:16,569
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

11
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:38,195
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

12
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:39,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty good.

13
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:03,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I gotta make sure.

14
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we hearing Inter and Drew tonight?

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

16
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we hearing Inter and Drew?

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I think we are.

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely, although that's very quiet.

19
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:10,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

20
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have the sensitive mic tonight?

21
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:12,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I do.

22
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:12,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

23
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have the sensitive mic?

24
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:15,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

25
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:15,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

26
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:16,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I do.

27
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:17,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Live radio.

28
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:19,503
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing sound checks live on air.

29
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:20,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Sound check one, two.

30
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:21,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyhow.

31
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:23,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, when I talk, it makes little lines up here.

32
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:24,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

33
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,564
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the magic of radio.

34
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't figured that out after six years?

35
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:27,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

36
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:35,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, say hello tonight to our website master, Dark Tetsuya is here in studio, amazing.

37
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, I made it.

38
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,191
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in town and yet you never seem to make it over here, but here you are tonight.

39
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:45,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Drew said he was going to come and get me yesterday, so.

40
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:46,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

41
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:46,993
Here I am.

42
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:51,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well Dark Tetsuya is here, we'll get him a little louder, we'll give him some mic lessons a little later.

43
00:02:52,324 --> 00:02:52,624
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S

44
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:17,006
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really bad tonight.

45
00:03:17,807 --> 00:03:21,690
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have to take a heat break in the middle of Part A. I'm serious.

46
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't laugh at me, Rice Princess.

48
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:24,812
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to get the Gatorade.

49
00:03:25,033 --> 00:03:27,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, it's pretty bad in here tonight.

50
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:30,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want Jamie to die live on air.

51
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be horrific.

52
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to die on air either.

53
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:37,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So we might take a heat break in the middle of Part A. I want to die on bacon.

54
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:40,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, say hello as well.

55
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:48,771
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is, since we broadcast at 6 o'clock, you know, the heat reaches its peak around 5 o'clock, so it should be cooling off, thankfully, throughout the night.

56
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:54,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, say hello as well to, um, well, wait, I guess we're not in order of importance anymore, because she'd be on the bottom of the list.

57
00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:55,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess!

58
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, aren't I on the bottom anyway?

59
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't I the last person?

60
00:04:00,058 --> 00:04:00,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

61
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just messing with you.

62
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut your face, Rob!

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

64
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,481
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Miss Princess?

65
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Mad at you now.

66
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:06,923
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you love me.

67
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:08,024
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

68
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:08,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

69
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:11,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a very full house tonight.

70
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:13,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Just lots and lots of people to comment on the news tonight.

71
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:18,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you in our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

72
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:20,148
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got lots of people in chat tonight.

73
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,989
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Stickax282 who says, I'm kind of new here to this whole live thing.

74
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:28,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, did you pick a shitty show to have as your first show because it's going to be chaotic tonight.

75
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,731
[SPEAKER_02]: But welcome.

76
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:32,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow Charlie says, Holy crap, it's Ranma.

77
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:34,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy crap, indeed.

78
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:35,616
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

79
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Zappy says, somebody dying live on air sounds exciting.

80
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:48,643
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's one of those things that's better when you're at home watching, but if you're like live in studio and considering the fact it's Jamie and it would kind of, like, I don't want Jamie to die.

81
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:52,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Jamie said some things that have made me angry before, but I don't want her to die.

82
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:58,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Heart.

83
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess Jamie has died and the ferret has taken over tonight.

84
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie is alive and very well and wants to talk to you all about her gaming week.

85
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,810
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

86
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Black Knight 2000.

87
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,413
[SPEAKER_01]: It's imbalanced, but I managed to replay on my first ball.

88
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,794
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only time I've ever done well on that game in my life.

89
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,930
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

90
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:49,849
[SPEAKER_01]: No Fear, and World Cup Soccer in the house and everything else that's outside.

91
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:52,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's working on our friend's Indiana Jones machine.

92
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:55,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, when I was there, I saw an Indiana Jones machine that was being worked on.

93
00:05:55,752 --> 00:05:56,973
[SPEAKER_01]: But we used it for cookies.

94
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:59,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I actually ate a cookie off the Indiana Jones machine.

95
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:00,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty awesome.

96
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:02,916
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very delicious.

97
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:03,796
[SPEAKER_01]: They were mint cookies.

98
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it was very delicious.

99
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:06,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Foodio.

100
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:09,059
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

101
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else that you played with your week?

102
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Any de-essin'?

103
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:16,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Traffic a lot, and I played Getting Lost to San Francisco.

104
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:17,555
[SPEAKER_02]: You played in Traffic?

105
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:19,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Driving.

106
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:23,339
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people tell me to go play in Traffic, but I've never actually played in Traffic.

107
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Initial D for real.

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,281
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was on the freeways.

109
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like Wan Gun.

110
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:29,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

111
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:31,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

112
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:34,423
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go around the studio and see what everybody else has been playing.

113
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:35,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I will start with the guests tonight.

114
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:36,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be nice.

115
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki and I will go last.

116
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Who has the mic for you kids over there?

117
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:44,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess, since you were on the bottom last time, why don't you start off?

118
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:44,826
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your gaming week?

119
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Non-existent.

120
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:46,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Next.

121
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:47,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, you're boring.

122
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,407
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Ranma, how was your gaming week?

123
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,650
[SPEAKER_09]: It was tolerable.

124
00:06:50,910 --> 00:07:03,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Mario Kart DS on the plane ride coming in and throughout the week on the subway, I was playing Custom Robo Arena, which has really become one of my favorite games.

125
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:05,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

126
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about Custom Robo Arena.

127
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:09,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've ever heard of it.

128
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:14,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, Custom Robo Arena is like a Pokemon-ish type game where...

129
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,474
[SPEAKER_09]: You get like this little cube as a robot and you customize it with different parts and you battle with it.

130
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:26,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fun part of the stylus is like cleaning up your robot because throughout the game, if you're running around with a dirty robo, nobody wants to fight with you.

131
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:29,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Tamagotchi where it'll poop randomly and you have to clean it up.

132
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:31,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds awesome.

133
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:33,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds very awesome.

134
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:34,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad for $9.99, so hey.

135
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,190
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

136
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:35,851
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

137
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,693
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll put it out.

138
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

139
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:11,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to apologize for the audio quality you've been hearing in the first little bits of the show, too.

140
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:16,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the mics got switched, and the guests got the mic with a very low gain, and I got the one with a very high gain.

141
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,473
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was very loud, and they were very quiet, but we've switched some things over here on the board.

142
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I ninja'd over to the board and switched some things while they were talking about their gaming week, so hopefully it's getting a little better.

143
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:27,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you as we move on.

144
00:08:27,218 --> 00:08:28,979
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkTetsuya, how was your gaming week?

145
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been playing?

146
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just a lot of Need for Speed Carbon.

147
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:37,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually beat it, but I went back and did some of the challenges to unlock some more stuff.

148
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:43,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, don't you have a Justin.TV channel or something where people can actually watch you play games?

149
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:46,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I stream random emulators and stuff.

150
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:50,151
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of games can people see if they check you out on Justin.TV?

151
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm working on Zelda right now.

152
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting to do Death Mountain.

153
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:55,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

154
00:08:56,483 --> 00:09:02,005
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was actually on Justin.TV very randomly one night, and you might not know what Dark Tits are, but I was watching you.

155
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:06,827
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing about Justin.TV is you can actually watch people and they never know.

156
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: You were playing La Mulana, and that was actually the first time I'd ever seen it, so it was cool.

157
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:12,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually got to check that out.

158
00:09:12,957 --> 00:09:14,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It does look very retro.

159
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see why people are really into that game.

160
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

161
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:18,639
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

162
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do not host your own podcast right now, right?

163
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,000
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at the moment.

164
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at the moment.

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,420
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

166
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Drew.

167
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Intern Drew, do you host a podcast, for heaven's sake?

168
00:09:28,162 --> 00:09:28,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet, no.

169
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:30,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

170
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: You got plans for one, don't you?

171
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:31,884
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

172
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:35,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Any asshole with a mic can do a podcast in this day and age.

173
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:36,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to describe it.

174
00:09:36,986 --> 00:09:38,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a platformer action game with RPG elements.

175
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,667
[SPEAKER_07]: That, I've been playing some Fire Emblem 7.

176
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:40,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to actually beat it.

177
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:07,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is brutal, even on the first try.

178
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:11,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And aside from that, I haven't been playing much.

179
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Weren't you Captain Excitement?

180
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked up Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 at Used Bookstore the other day.

181
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:23,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't get it to run.

182
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:24,515
[SPEAKER_07]: It crashes.

183
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:27,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Best ten bucks I ever spent.

184
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:29,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ubisoft.

185
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Now make your games work.

186
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:32,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

187
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:34,494
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

188
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's going to... He's putting his mic down somewhat angrily.

189
00:10:37,878 --> 00:10:39,820
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, how was your gaming week?

190
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,501
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you play?

191
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to figure out which mic I'm supposed to be having here.

192
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:43,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're that one.

193
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:44,306
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

194
00:10:45,347 --> 00:10:48,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play too much this week because I've been busy.

195
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:50,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did play...

196
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto 4 Defender Castle

197
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,006
[SPEAKER_08]: and Mario Kart Wii.

198
00:11:16,286 --> 00:11:17,986
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to download a ton more Miis.

199
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:22,747
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, we got one that's got a crab on the person's face, which is kind of funny.

200
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:24,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It pinches its claws.

201
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:26,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Crab people!

202
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:27,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, crab people.

203
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And then one with Mickey Mouse.

204
00:11:31,368 --> 00:11:34,469
[SPEAKER_08]: We just downloaded a bunch of Miis and played the levels with the Miis in the background.

205
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:34,989
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

206
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:39,010
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just tried the...

207
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Homebrew, Smash Bros.

208
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:44,272
[SPEAKER_08]: game that someone had made or worked on.

209
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:49,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess it's very early because it's not very good right now.

210
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:51,216
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, it's not... Needs work?

211
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:54,517
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even close to being started, let alone done.

212
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:55,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

213
00:11:58,199 --> 00:11:59,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was it for your week.

214
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,961
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a pretty slow gaming week, all things considered.

215
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:02,481
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got other projects going on, right?

216
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm busy.

217
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:05,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Then my car was in the shop.

218
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fun.

219
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:06,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

220
00:12:07,264 --> 00:12:07,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun, fun.

221
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:09,045
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had an exciting week.

222
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

223
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:40,004
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

224
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan really loves Aerosmith.

225
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it's worth it to Dan.

226
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:26,425
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't buy it.

227
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:28,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, Guitar Hero Journey, I would have dropped the $60.

228
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have paid $100 for Guitar Hero Journey.

229
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:32,857
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not Guitar Hero Journey.

230
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:33,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

231
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:38,747
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did motivate me to go back and actually play some Guitar Hero 3.

232
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:42,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still cannot beat that freaking Slipknot song on hard.

233
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you download the free song?

234
00:13:45,153 --> 00:13:45,554
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

235
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:47,256
[SPEAKER_02]: The Top Gun song is awesome.

236
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:53,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish it was Danger Zone, but... Still, what a great patriotic tune.

237
00:13:55,638 --> 00:13:57,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the last thing we need is homoerotic volleyball scenes.

238
00:14:09,456 --> 00:14:10,137
[SPEAKER_02]: www.DarkSakura.com

239
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:28,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

240
00:14:54,947 --> 00:15:02,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's the part I'm having trouble kind of getting over because I want to strum everything and it's hard to tell when the notes are coming that fast which ones you have to strum and which ones you don't.

241
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Guitar Hero people in chat know what I'm talking about, please?

242
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:05,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do I just sound crazy?

243
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:06,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

244
00:15:06,849 --> 00:15:08,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody in the studio is looking at me like, huh?

245
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like the hammer-ons and stuff.

246
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

247
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tutorial does not explain it that well.

248
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:19,311
[SPEAKER_02]: The tutorial explains a little bit about the, how you can, like, I'm not even going to try to explain it.

249
00:15:19,331 --> 00:15:20,991
[SPEAKER_02]: The tutorial doesn't explain it very well.

250
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:22,672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of something I had to learn on my own.

251
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:23,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

252
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:26,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we begin, I have presents.

253
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:44,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Presence?

254
00:15:44,596 --> 00:15:46,377
[SPEAKER_02]: What a good way to start tonight's housekeeping.

255
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:48,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I love housekeeping to begin with presents.

256
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:59,361
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, before the show, I was showing the people on JustinTV this, but Loki got me some new floor mats with Hello Kitty on them, which is hilarious because I already had ones with penguins on them, so I'm going to figure out how to use them both.

257
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,502
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

258
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to lie on a shirt.

259
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,810
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys didn't plan that, did you?

260
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,111
[SPEAKER_07]: You have no choice.

261
00:16:44,732 --> 00:16:45,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's great.

262
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:46,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the shirts.

263
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:47,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's great.

264
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:51,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll change into one right now, but not live on cam, because that's kind of gross.

265
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:53,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

266
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:55,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

267
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: I do heart NY.

268
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:57,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to go back.

269
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

270
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:04,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, hey, I'm wearing my shirt that says Ice Skull Pirates.

271
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:23,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, she is!

272
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:23,863
[SPEAKER_08]: No comment!

273
00:17:23,883 --> 00:17:24,303
[SPEAKER_08]: What is that?

274
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:24,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

275
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,721
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, housekeeping.

276
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:45,142
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

277
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:46,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have anything for the show.

278
00:17:46,542 --> 00:17:49,263
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no interviews coming up, which is kind of sad, but I will say this.

279
00:17:49,343 --> 00:17:51,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We always have our LiveJournal community and the MySpace communities.

280
00:17:52,424 --> 00:17:53,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And Facebook.

281
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook, we are the OLRMY, O-L-R-M-Y, if you want to look us up.

282
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,787
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to join us on LiveJournal, Orange Lounge.

283
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:02,208
[SPEAKER_02]: No radio, just Orange Lounge is us on LiveJournal.

284
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And on MySpace, we are Orange Lounge Radio.

285
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Three different names for three different sites, if we could be any more confusing.

286
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Standards Department.

287
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't confuse us with the group Orange Range.

288
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:15,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the group Orange Lounge, for that matter.

289
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, has Tomosuke made an Orange Lounge song in the past three years?

290
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:19,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he has.

291
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:20,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Has he?

292
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:21,029
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

293
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,011
[SPEAKER_02]: So we own it now, I think.

294
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:24,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's some rule now that we own Orange Lounge.

295
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, just kidding.

296
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get to tonight's gaming news.

297
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's going to start us off tonight.

298
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so more details about Mega Man 9.

299
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:38,560
[SPEAKER_08]: It is going to be completely 8-bit looking, including the very limited color palette as well.

300
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:43,666
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be also really fucking hard, just like most Mega Man games.

301
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:49,853
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, there was some hands-on stuff from Joystick and some other...

302
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:52,214
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

303
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to mention about my gaming week I've been playing Mega Man Anniversary Collection and I'm starting with Mega Man 1 I'm about to pull my fucking hair out on the Iceman level with those fucking blocks Whoever invented the block puzzles needs to burn in hell

304
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:40,144
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, once you get past the blocks, once you get past the blocks... Then it only gets worse in Mega Man 2 and the Heat Man stage, unless you have Item 2.

305
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you have Item 2, which you ought to.

306
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:42,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know.

307
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:50,891
[SPEAKER_07]: But seriously, until about the fifth game, the fifth NES game, I never thought Mega Man series was really that hard.

308
00:19:51,131 --> 00:19:55,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob, if you want to make everything easy on the first Mega Man, start with Cut Man.

309
00:19:55,614 --> 00:19:55,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

310
00:19:56,355 --> 00:19:59,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I have killed Cut Man, Elect Man, Guts Man, Bomb Man.

311
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:01,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just... I got to get Ice Man now so I can get Fire Man.

312
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,208
[SPEAKER_09]: GameGuru says Nintendo games should be Nintendo hard.

313
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,262
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

314
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:54,425
[SPEAKER_04]: They're okay.

315
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,426
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I like the Nintendo Mega Man.

316
00:20:57,446 --> 00:20:59,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So this old school thing made you squee in many places, right?

317
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it did.

318
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:01,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to hear.

319
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should just continue with making Mega Man games just like this.

320
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:13,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Just make them all a bit from now on and if you want to do the 16-bit or the little higher graphics games, just do the Mega Man X series.

321
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:16,334
[SPEAKER_08]: They have really too many series going on.

322
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:21,916
[SPEAKER_08]: They have that ZX series now and then they also have Star Force and just...

323
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:24,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring back Legends.

324
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring back the original 8-bit Mega Man.

325
00:21:26,322 --> 00:21:26,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they are.

326
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You're getting half of what you want.

327
00:21:28,363 --> 00:21:30,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but they need to continue.

328
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,064
[SPEAKER_08]: One game is not bringing it back.

329
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:35,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to read some comments as well from JustinTV.

330
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:37,405
[SPEAKER_02]: We have more people on JustinTV than I've ever seen before.

331
00:21:37,425 --> 00:21:38,125
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy.

332
00:21:38,886 --> 00:21:42,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Illustrator says, Real fucking hard keeps the ignorant noobs away.

333
00:21:42,286 --> 00:21:45,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mega Man 9 is not really a multiplayer game, so who cares about noobs?

334
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:47,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Let a noob noob themselves in a...

335
00:21:47,728 --> 00:21:48,609
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the point.

336
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:53,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be fucking hard, and then you keep playing it until you can pass it, and then you become better.

337
00:21:54,032 --> 00:21:57,073
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't just go, oh, I suck, move on to the next game.

338
00:21:58,054 --> 00:22:03,077
[SPEAKER_07]: As it was said before about leading noobs to water, most of what you get are wet noobs.

339
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:05,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're leading noobs to Splash Woman.

340
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:06,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

341
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:11,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she's going to be a bit wet.

342
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:12,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're disgusting.

343
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's a little tagline on the poster.

344
00:22:16,922 --> 00:22:19,703
[SPEAKER_02]: This September, Splash Woman gets wet.

345
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:20,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we explicit yet?

346
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:22,504
[SPEAKER_07]: We always are.

347
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:23,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck!

348
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:24,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we are.

349
00:22:25,926 --> 00:22:26,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

350
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:27,866
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not necessarily.

351
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:32,628
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to say it a few more times because I watched... Fuck, fuck, fuckity, fucker, fucker, fuck, fuck, fuck.

352
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:33,148
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

353
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:37,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I watched Hancock over the weekend and they did have fuck in there once, but it's still PG-13.

354
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,151
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's got cock in the title!

355
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:42,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Every movie should have cock in the title.

356
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:43,540
[SPEAKER_08]: His name's John Hancock.

357
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the fuck show already?

358
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Cockio.

359
00:22:46,662 --> 00:22:47,743
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the cock show!

360
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:50,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

361
00:22:52,006 --> 00:22:52,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

362
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mega Man 9's been dated for September as well, right?

363
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's what I already said.

364
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:00,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I missed it.

365
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:00,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sleeping.

366
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about Splash Woman's cock.

367
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:03,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

368
00:23:07,343 --> 00:23:10,524
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know she probably had one at some point.

369
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:13,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Wily has his leftover parts.

370
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow!

371
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:19,707
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it with Wily and making every single one of his robots male?

372
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,748
[SPEAKER_07]: You think he's got a little secret?

373
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:22,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's branching out.

374
00:23:24,432 --> 00:23:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it sexist, DarkSakura?

375
00:23:25,593 --> 00:23:26,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, he's bi.

376
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:27,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it sexist?

377
00:23:28,634 --> 00:23:37,337
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because see, Dr. Wily likes little boys, but that's okay because so does Dr. Light, and Dr. Light also likes little girls.

378
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:39,595
[SPEAKER_11]: What the hell is wrong with this show?

379
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:43,098
[SPEAKER_02]: For real, I'm clicking unsubscribe right now.

380
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:43,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Click.

381
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:45,420
[SPEAKER_02]: That was disgusting.

382
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're saying Dr. Wally's a member of the Catholic Church?

383
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:49,423
[SPEAKER_02]: God, Chris Hansen's gonna be here any minute.

384
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,004
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

385
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:51,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a seat.

386
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:52,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a seat.

387
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:53,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, shit, you already took a seat.

388
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't think there's any altar girls.

389
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,352
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's probably Presbyterian.

390
00:24:01,812 --> 00:24:02,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, look.

391
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:10,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to a much cleaner, safer, kid-friendly game.

392
00:24:11,637 --> 00:24:12,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing.

393
00:24:12,837 --> 00:24:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing.

394
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: There has been a teaser in the latest official Nintendo magazine over in the UK.

395
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:28,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the magazine scan that's floating around the internet, or if you're actually on the magazine, it says, it's been a while.

396
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to revisit an old friend.

397
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:32,565
[SPEAKER_02]: How's your village doing these days?

398
00:24:33,365 --> 00:24:37,426
[SPEAKER_02]: That is... It just has a little picture from Animal Crossing and has that quote.

399
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Could that be a hint that we get Animal Crossing 83?

400
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet.

401
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:41,627
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

402
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:42,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a thought.

403
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:45,248
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions.

404
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:49,009
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii one's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions?

405
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:49,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

406
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:51,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to make you load your GameCube Village.

407
00:24:52,718 --> 00:24:55,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe that's why the quote saying, how's your village doing all these days?

408
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:58,760
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you better go pull some fucking weeds or you're in for it when the new game comes out.

409
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,281
[SPEAKER_01]: It means I better go get my memory card back from my friend who was taking care of my village for me.

410
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:03,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't me, was it?

411
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:03,661
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

412
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:03,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

413
00:25:03,841 --> 00:25:09,723
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what would be funny is the reason they're saying that they're all, yeah, you should really go back and check how your village is doing because you're not getting a new game.

414
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:11,184
[SPEAKER_08]: You better go back and play the old one.

415
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:12,804
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be the joke.

416
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:13,504
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

417
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:13,984
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

418
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:15,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Japanese one, too.

419
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:17,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a new memory card.

420
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:18,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost my old village.

421
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:19,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find it.

422
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:26,458
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a new memory card, so I'm thinking about making, like, OLR Town and maybe playing it on Justin.TV and letting the chatters... You should do that, Rob.

423
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let the chatters name stuff.

424
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:28,879
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.

425
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:29,359
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do that.

426
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:32,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have to have... Who was the lesbian?

427
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:34,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

428
00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:35,237
[SPEAKER_01]: She lives in my village.

429
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,738
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lesbian that lived in the village.

430
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:38,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I remember.

431
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:39,760
[SPEAKER_01]: Her whole house was a gym.

432
00:25:41,321 --> 00:25:44,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was our resident lesbian, so we put a nice little rainbow sign up in front of her house.

433
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we put a gay pride flag in front of her house.

434
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:47,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she moved.

435
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:47,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

436
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:51,267
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started putting the pattern up in every town we visited.

437
00:25:51,607 --> 00:25:54,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we have her saying, like, I like boobs as a little thing?

438
00:25:55,009 --> 00:25:55,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

439
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing is so awesome.

440
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we also had someone running around going, cock.

441
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:06,579
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says the question is if Rob and Irene will quit WoW to play Animal Crossing Wii Yes!

442
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,823
[SPEAKER_02]: RicePrincess says she already has Are you getting a head start in a new village?

443
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:28,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if they'll batten you all It is a 12 step recovery program Alright, it is a 12 step recovery program We'll see, E3 is coming very soon I have my fingers and toes and other parts crossed that Animal Crossing will be an announcement at E3, so we'll see

444

[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.

445
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on with other news here.

446
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:34,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, actually, I'll read quick chat comments here.

447
00:26:34,702 --> 00:26:37,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Sharon says, Animal Crossing was only somewhat kid-friendly.

448
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It taught you to not take loans from anyone.

449
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:44,685
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do, you'll have to do bitch work for your neighbors and take all the furniture they throw away for the rest of your life.

450
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:45,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

451
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:46,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

452
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:48,987
[SPEAKER_02]: More news.

00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:53,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

456
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guess what?

457
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:55,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicken butt.

458
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:58,670
[SPEAKER_00]: There's... Guess why?

459
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:01,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Chicken Thigh, In Your Eye.

460
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:05,237
[SPEAKER_02]: This is totally one of those shows.

461
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:05,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

462
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:09,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Having people in studio, like a live audience practically, ruins this show.

463
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:13,740
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rob, for my story, you need to do something.

464
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what do I have to do for your story?

465
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:21,743
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to pull up the said site that this refers to from Squeenix and play the sound effect and see if anyone in the chatroom gets it first.

466
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:25,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling everybody in chat already knows what's coming.

467
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:26,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want the sound effect.

468
00:27:27,683 --> 00:27:28,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

469
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is fucked up in front of a live audience.

470
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:33,207
[SPEAKER_02]: What a demanding woman tonight.

471
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:35,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, I've got to get there.

472
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:37,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

473
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:39,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, that's not it.

474
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:40,198
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not me.

475
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:41,939
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to start reading the story.

476
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:42,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't find it.

477
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,723
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a particular game that I'm sure a lot of people have been wanting for quite a while.

478
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:51,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, it's the link that says Japanese website, by the way.

479
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, wait.

480
00:27:54,046 --> 00:28:01,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they bringing back to some sort of system their Super Metroid?

481
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:02,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that game is awesome.

482
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:02,490
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

483
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:06,152
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing back an RPG.

484
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:12,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It is speculated to be a port, hopefully remaining in 2D, on the Nintendo DS.

485
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:14,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it in Fury or Super Metroid?

486
00:28:17,076 --> 00:28:17,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

487
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:19,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you did there.

488
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,238
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not at all.

489
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:25,459
[SPEAKER_07]: But do the viewers, do the listeners... I'm going to throw something at you, okay?

490
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Please do.

491
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Chrono Trigger.

492
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:41,314
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to ScreenX's site, the address is square-nx.co.jp slash ctds.

493
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:46,577
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Rob is pulling it up now.

494
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:48,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of slow because we're broadcasting.

495
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there you go.

496
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:50,560
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

497
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:53,341
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear the effect.

498
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:55,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if they're going to hear it.

499
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:57,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We got so much shit running in studio tonight.

500
00:28:58,152 --> 00:29:10,833
[SPEAKER_01]: at any rate, well if you go to that site you will see the clock and you will hear the ticking and you will know that it's Chrono Trigger because no other game freaking has that clock making that same ticking noise at the very start of it

501
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:17,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my computer is not enjoying broadcasting an internet radio show and doing the Chrono Trigger website at the same time.

502
00:29:17,354 --> 00:29:22,920
[SPEAKER_01]: We will let you do that for yourself so that you can have a truly interactive experience, those of you listening to the podcast.

503
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Alpha Cananogram says in chat, DarkSakura, now it's chronotrigger.jp as well.

504
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:29,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?

505
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:30,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Rad.

506
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:32,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make it 3D, Squeenix.

507
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:33,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fuck it up.

508
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaoran says Chrono Trigger, it's over.

509
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:39,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, guys, there are other RPGs that have better storylines and better character development.

510
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:40,188
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

511
00:29:40,448 --> 00:29:41,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, snap.

512
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:44,632
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not, okay?

513
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:45,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he did.

514
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:48,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And they haven't translated the ones that do surpass it.

515
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, I heard that the Chrono Trigger... What, Loki, what?

516
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:56,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

517
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:57,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.

518
00:29:58,223 --> 00:30:00,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say about Chrono Trigger, it's not 3D.

519
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we already know it's going to be the same old sprites?

520
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:02,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, exactly.

521
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:03,749
[SPEAKER_08]: They did nothing.

522
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,072
[SPEAKER_08]: That we can tell, at least.

523
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:08,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonus dungeon, Wi-Fi play.

524
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:10,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe add some bonus dungeons.

525
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:14,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard co-op, but how can you play co-op in that game?

526
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:15,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have three people.

527
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:16,784
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be like Secret of Mana.

528
00:30:19,158 --> 00:30:19,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Secret of Mana

529
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:31,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was fun.

530
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:32,539
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot of fun.

531
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a multitap, so that was a lot of fun.

532
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times.

533
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:59,904
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other speculation, and actually I hope that this will be included, is that the animated scenes that they did for the PlayStation version are rumored to be making it to the DS version, especially if they're spending less of the processing power on the way the game runs and putting more of it into having the cinemas, because that'll make it sweet.

534
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,771
[SPEAKER_01]: More endings!

535
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:04,834
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Mad asks, co-op gato battle.

536
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:07,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, sweet.

537
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:12,000
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know, everyone who's in this room that's played Chrono Trigger, how many endings have you gotten?

538
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:13,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Two.

539
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:14,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, if I remember.

540
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:15,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably four.

541
00:31:15,964 --> 00:31:16,345
[SPEAKER_07]: All of them.

542
00:31:17,566 --> 00:31:18,747
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no time on your hands, sir.

543
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have too much time.

544
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the secret one where you go watch the...

545
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:26,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.

546
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:27,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

547
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:45,750
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done that one.

548
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:54,496
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one where you get the developers ending where you actually have representations of the developers and you go into the last room and it's Toriyama wearing his gas mask and everything.

549
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:58,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And the credits go by really, really fast because they want you to skip past it again.

550
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:01,460
[SPEAKER_02]: All this freaking reminiscing here in studio.

551
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:04,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki looks like he's about to explode wanting to talk about Elebits.

552
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:05,683
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't really care.

553
00:32:05,703 --> 00:32:13,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't play really much of Chrono Trigger and I don't feel bad for not having played Chrono Trigger either, so...

554
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:18,387
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanna play Chrono Trigger, I'll hook up my Super Nintendo and grab my cartridge.

555
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:21,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the DS one might be kind of cool.

556
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:23,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play Final Fantasy 6.

557
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:29,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing as getting a Chrono Trigger Super Nintendo cartridge at this time, if you didn't hang on to one, it's going to cost you a lot of money to get one now.

558
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:35,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear this game is going to have this super secret final ending where you take the game back to GameStop and trade it in for store credit.

559
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:36,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob.

560
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:37,258
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

561
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:38,899
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't pay for my copy.

562
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone gave it to me and he moved.

563
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:43,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have it in the box.

564
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:44,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, inherited.

565
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't plan on paying for my copy either.

566
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:47,946
[SPEAKER_01]: What a coincidence.

567
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

568
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:49,947
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, move on.

569
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:50,708
[SPEAKER_02]: More stories.

570
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:51,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Less exciting news.

571
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:57,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Elebits 2 has been confirmed, and it's not the same Elebits you may have remembered.

572
00:32:58,071 --> 00:33:04,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's some sort of top-down, sprite-based game, and there's lots of Elebits running around.

573
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:08,175
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like a cartoony version of Pikmin or something like that.

574
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:09,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

575
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:12,957
[SPEAKER_08]: But Elebits, The Adventures of Kai and Zero is coming out this fall.

576
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:14,978
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

577
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:16,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks weird.

578
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:24,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe they're just like, you know, the Wii one just didn't work like we wanted it to, so let's just jump ship and go to the DS.

579
00:33:24,414 --> 00:33:27,698
[SPEAKER_08]: They probably tried to do a 3D version on the DS and were like, wow, that sucks.

580
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:31,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they're just like, okay, let's see what we can do with the touchscreen.

581
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:33,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

582
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:38,851
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way they could have done a 3D version on the DS anyways, because there's no depth in it.

583
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:41,998
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.

584
00:33:42,198 --> 00:33:44,599
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of depth in a lot of DS games, actually.

585
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,019
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like Pokemon.

586
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Pokemon sells billions and billions of copies, so it probably is not a bad idea.

587
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: There you have it.

588
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:58,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming to the Wii, however, even if Elebits 2 may not be coming to the Wii, apparently Cooking Mama...

589
00:33:58,823 --> 00:34:14,791
[SPEAKER_02]: there's going to be another Cooking Mama game on the Wii it's Cooking Mama World Kitchen and it's coming to you from Majesco and it's a follow up to the game Cooking Mama Cook Off which was kind of crap because they tried to port a DS game to the Wii and it just didn't work very well sadly

590
00:34:15,151 --> 00:34:16,292
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

591
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:39,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm betting on the second.

592
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hope not because Cookie Mama's kind of cool.

593
00:34:42,903 --> 00:34:45,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, Jamie, I know you love Cookie Mama very much.

594
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:47,929
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about a rhythm-based Cookie Mama game on the Wii?

595
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reserve judgment until I actually try it.

596
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:52,133
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I say.

597
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:54,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, and I feel the same way, but your heart doesn't like, you know.

598
00:34:55,717 --> 00:34:59,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm completely apathetic towards it right now.

599
00:34:59,782 --> 00:35:00,102
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

600
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:01,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play it.

601
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:02,192
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested.

602
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:05,053
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not going to make my judgment until I actually see it.

603
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:11,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, honestly, I've had games where I've made a harsh judgment about them to start.

604
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:12,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's turned out that they've been pretty fun.

605
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:16,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to... Like Imagine Babies?

606
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:17,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no!

607
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:18,517
[SPEAKER_01]: That game sucks!

608
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:22,758
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is like the bugs that live in shit.

609
00:35:24,515 --> 00:35:25,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

610
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:27,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did we have in the chat room?

611
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:32,156
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

612
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:34,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be Cooking Mama.

613
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:37,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Frisbee says, Cooking Mama, Hell's Kitchen.

614
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that might be a little bit fun if somebody screams at Cooking Mama and makes her cry.

615
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:46,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Except if they based it off of a show, it should be based off of a good show.

616
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:52,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Hell's Kitchen is already getting a DS game and it's actually coming out before Cooking Mama.

617
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

618
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:55,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's going to be any good though.

619
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well there you have it.

620
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:00,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see about that Cooking Mommy game.

621
00:36:01,183 --> 00:36:04,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I have to admit it makes me a little bit nervous, but we'll see.

622
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:06,967
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall.

623
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:17,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for more happy wee news, this might make some people very pleased, but there is a...

624
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:21,537
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more coming out for WiiWare.

625
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:24,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually released on Friday.

626
00:36:27,538 --> 00:36:34,719
[SPEAKER_01]: First is Pokemon Ranch, where, to quote, it's a place where Pokemon and people love living together.

627
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:37,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

628
00:36:37,759 --> 00:36:38,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

629
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:39,980
[SPEAKER_07]: They need Pokemon Bunny Ranch.

630
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,160
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

631
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Pokemon Sniper.

632
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,061
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's Jigglypimp's Whore Lounge from Kalec in the House.

633
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Slut Bunny Slut Bunny

634
00:37:15,689 --> 00:37:18,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaoran in chat wants to know if you can brand them.

635
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:19,711
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

636
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:25,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Pokemon Snap 2.

637
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:26,956
[SPEAKER_02]: This time you have a gun.

638
00:37:29,057 --> 00:37:30,578
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole new kind of rail shooter.

639
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:32,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Pokemon Snap their necks.

640
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheeseburger says Imagine Sniper.

641
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:39,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play Imagine Sniper.

642
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:43,341
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be like Silent Scope, though.

643
00:37:44,642 --> 00:37:46,924
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to be 1,000 Wii points.

644
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:51,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is a game that you pop bubbles on.

645
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:54,711
[SPEAKER_02]: The bubble popping game is finally coming out.

646
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:57,213
[SPEAKER_02]: What a clever title.

647
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:58,094
[SPEAKER_01]: You just pop bubbles.

648
00:37:58,414 --> 00:37:59,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like Buster Brothers?

649
00:38:00,576 --> 00:38:07,202
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think it's supposed to be more like... It's a bubble wraps game.

650
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I played with that the other day!

651
00:38:11,153 --> 00:38:12,459
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Bubble Wrap!

652
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:16,305
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Going to Seize Candy and the best part is the bubble wrap.

653
00:38:16,365 --> 00:38:16,965
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

654
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:18,846
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called I Bought a Teapot and Played the Bubble Wrap.

655
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:19,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my question.

656
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:23,647
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feed a Pokemon an Alka-Seltzer, will it explode?

657
00:38:24,147 --> 00:38:24,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

658
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:27,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the avian ones will.

659
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:29,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's some of them.

660
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:30,129
[SPEAKER_01]: There's birds.

661
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Pikachu giblets everywhere.

662
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Rice Princess has this horrified look on her face.

663
00:38:35,491 --> 00:38:36,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you play Pokemon Ranch?

664
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:37,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it sound like a fun game to you?

665
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:39,273
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

666
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,916
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rob... Why?

667
00:38:43,296 --> 00:38:44,397
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 700 Wii Points.

668
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:46,139
[SPEAKER_08]: To pop bubbles.

669
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:47,099
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome, though.

670
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo and WiiWare, they're really doing some different things.

671
00:38:51,303 --> 00:38:54,325
[SPEAKER_08]: People want a new Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game.

672
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,347
[SPEAKER_08]: You get Crystal Chronicles, My Life as the King.

673
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really a Crystal Chronicles game.

674
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:04,293
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of like other people are having fun outside of your city and you're just staying home watching TV.

675
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:05,574
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of what it is.

676
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:07,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas Pokemon Ranch...

677
00:39:07,794 --> 00:39:11,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel an OLR game somewhere in here called, like, Goddamn I'm So Bored.

678
00:39:30,405 --> 00:39:31,686
[SPEAKER_07]: We play it every Sunday.

679
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:35,690
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the Me Parade.

680
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:44,397
[SPEAKER_02]: In God Damn I'm So Bored, you start a podcast with your two friends, and then you just sit there and pop bubble wrap the whole time.

681
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:44,958
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

682
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:46,619
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game to be made here somewhere.

683
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to think about it.

684
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,866
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have to include turning on your Wii for the first time and trying to watch Me March with only one me on it.

685
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,007
[SPEAKER_02]: That's goddamn, I'm so lonely.

686
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Magnetica Magnetica

687
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:54,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Magnetica, and then they have Toki Tori, which is just lame, and the bubble popping game, which, I don't know, it's all kind of lame.

688
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:56,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well.

689
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:00,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Something else that hopefully is not lame.

690
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:02,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Castlevania Judgment.

691
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:08,443
[SPEAKER_08]: The kind of, not really a Castlevania game, but now it's Soul Castlevania.

692
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:11,884
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Soul Calibur, but Castlevania characters and that kind of thing.

693
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:16,367
[SPEAKER_08]: It will have Wii DS connectivity.

694
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:21,390
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be able to plug in your new Order of Es... What was it?

695
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:21,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh...

696
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:28,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Ecclesia, the new DS platformer game coming out to unlock bonus gameplay content.

697
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:32,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And also so Konami can say, we sold you one of each.

698
00:41:32,966 --> 00:41:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucker.

699
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me guess, let me guess.

700
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:42,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking a character that you only see in the DS game is going to be playable in the Wii game if you connect them.

701
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,506
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

702
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:46,067
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?

703
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:52,780
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably paid to unlock content because you're paying for the DS game to unlock the content on the disc that was already there.

704
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:54,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't surprise me at all.

705
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,641
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's what you need to do.

706
00:41:57,741 --> 00:42:02,243
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a friend that has this game for the DS and you just have him come over and done.

707
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:03,544
[SPEAKER_08]: No purchase necessary.

708
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:04,004
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

709
00:42:06,986 --> 00:42:07,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

710
00:42:08,107 --> 00:42:14,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Loki was talking about this a little bit earlier during his gaming week, but if you haven't heard yet, there is a homebrew Super Smash Bros.

711
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumble that's available on the DS.

712
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:20,614
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by a homebrew programmer that goes by the name of Fuzzy.

713
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:23,295
[SPEAKER_02]: If you touch him, do you get dizzy?

714
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:24,216
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

715
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:26,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad joke there.

716
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:32,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow, apparently, though, the game only has three levels in it right now, and just one character is playable in the game.

717
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:32,768
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Mario.

718
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:34,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I have not actually played the game.

719
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:38,671
[SPEAKER_02]: There's YouTube-age of it, but Loki, since you've actually played the game, tell us a little more about it.

720
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:40,092
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very simplified.

721
00:42:40,112 --> 00:42:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's sprite-based characters, obviously.

722
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Smash Bros., or is it like Mario?

723
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:46,595
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be like Smash Bros.

724
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:47,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

725
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:51,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, the only playable character is Mario right now, and...

726
00:42:52,443 --> 00:43:01,128
[SPEAKER_08]: The computer player doesn't really do anything, just kind of runs around trying to avoid you, and you can't really smash him off the edge, defeating the purpose of the Smash Bros.

727
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:07,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, I think they should just port over Mugen, but that's just... It's asking a bit much.

728
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:08,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know if it would be able to run it either.

729
00:43:10,757 --> 00:43:14,980
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, if you are homebrew enabled on your DS, which I'm actually kind of curious.

730
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to ask the chat room a question.

731
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:19,704
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people are actually homebrew enabled on their DS?

732
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:20,985
[SPEAKER_02]: We have how many people in chat right now?

733
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:22,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost 50 people in chat right now.

734
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how many of you are homebrew enabled in chat right now.

735
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:28,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Say something while we go over some release dates.

736
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,031
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with the UK.

737
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:34,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, coming out in the UK, we have a number of things all on the 11th.

738
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:37,940
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Beijing 2008, the official game of the Olympic Games.

739
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,581
[SPEAKER_01]: The official video game, sorry, of the Olympic Games.

740
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:41,821
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on PC.

741
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:44,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Devil May Cry 4 on PC.

742
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:46,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Doodle Hex on DS.

743
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:48,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Secret Agent Clank on PSP.

744
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:50,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Sports Party on Wii.

745
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer Athletics on PS2, PC and Xbox 360.

746
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:55,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And The Incredible Hulk on PS2.

747
00:43:58,311 --> 00:43:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a busy week.

748
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:05,917
[SPEAKER_08]: In the US, it's not that busy of a week, but there's still some stuff coming out.

749
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:08,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Civilization Revolution.

750
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:09,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited, yay!

751
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,663
[SPEAKER_08]: PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the DS.

752
00:44:14,764 --> 00:44:18,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Also this week, Unreal Tournament 3 for the Xbox 360.

753
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:21,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got, let's see here.

754
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:24,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of people looking forward to that one on 360.

755
00:44:25,343 --> 00:44:25,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

756
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:36,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii, which I guess it's not quite a port of the DS game.

757
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:38,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

758
00:44:38,226 --> 00:44:42,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Carnival Games on the DS, and Wonder World Amusement Park on the Wii.

759
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:47,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, is the Carnival Games on the DS the other way around, where they ported a Wii game to the DS?

760
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:47,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

761
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

762
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

763
00:44:51,110 --> 00:45:12,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 Devil May Cry 4 on the PC PurrPals for the Wii Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on the PSP and let's see and I believe that's pretty much it for the week

764
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:33,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Stickax282 says Civ Rev for the fucking win I agree, that's the game I'm definitely looking forward to because I actually really like the demo and I don't think it's going to crap on my childhood memories of the original Civilization which I was a little worried about at first so I'm pretty excited about that GameGuru agrees, Civ Rev for the win and Rob with 2B says Carnival Games is a different game

765
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:42,329
[SPEAKER_02]: N, I don't Me, I don't even have a DS If I knew how to do it I am Sky, I am homebrew enabled Raise his hand, can play homebrew Nope, I am homebrew enabled Yep

766
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,761
[SPEAKER_02]: DS, what's that?

767
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not turned on my DS in like a year.

768
00:46:00,304 --> 00:46:01,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, but my friends is.

769
00:46:02,106 --> 00:46:04,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, no homebrew on my DS.

770
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:07,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I am homebrew enabled for DS, Wii, PSP.

771
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:08,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have a DS.

772
00:46:08,813 --> 00:46:12,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, my GBA, DS, PSP, and iPod are all running homebrew apps.

773
00:46:12,577 --> 00:46:14,359
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a larger percentage than I would have thought.

774
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:17,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't run homebrew on my DS because I just don't know how to do it.

775
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:22,394
[SPEAKER_11]: and Loki's like, hey, you want a hit?

776
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:27,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, once you get the device to do it, it's really simple.

777
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:28,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just drag drop.

778
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:30,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

779
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:36,127
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like, you know, a Wii where some installation is required and that kind of thing.

780
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:39,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Japan and look at some release dates coming out over there.

781
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,291
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Xbox...

782
00:46:41,539 --> 00:46:44,942
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Xbox 360, some games are getting a price reduction.

783
00:46:45,322 --> 00:46:54,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Viva Pinata on the Xbox 360 is getting cut in price, as well as Forza Motorsport 2 and Test Drive Unlimited, as well as the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

784
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:56,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They all move into the Platinum Collection in Japan.

785
00:46:57,193 --> 00:46:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

786
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: again a couple games go into the best series but here's what a lot of people are looking forward to Persona 4 comes out in Japan on July 10th and if you're a hardcore RPG fan and you can read Japanese and understand it you are probably importing this game I would imagine just call it a hunch

787
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:58,436
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Nintendo DS, Custom Beat Battle, Draglade 2, Cosmetic Paradise, Maki no Kiseki, Pet Shop, Monogatari DS, Taito

788
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:08,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

789
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:13,791
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Sony PSP, I doubt there's a lot this week.

790
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:15,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking a look.

791
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:17,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God of War, Chains of Olympus.

792
00:48:18,178 --> 00:48:18,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that back.

793
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,763
[SPEAKER_02]: God of War, Chains of Olympus gets its Japanese version this week.

794
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:23,422
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

795
00:48:23,522 --> 00:48:28,104
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I read that last week on the show, so I must have been looking in advance or something.

796
00:48:28,264 --> 00:48:31,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, a vehicle battle game comes out on the PSP from Irem.

797
00:48:32,626 --> 00:48:37,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Ponkotsu Roman Daika Sugeki Bumpy Trot.

798
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,610
[SPEAKER_08]: God, what the hell do they call it?

799
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Steambot Chronicles.

800
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:45,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that other name, though.

801
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:45,612
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.

802
00:48:45,752 --> 00:48:46,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Bumpy Trot.

803
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:46,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Bumpy Trot.

804
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:48,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

805
00:49:05,496 --> 00:49:09,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Random question from chat that has nothing to do with anything we're talking about.

806
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,482
[SPEAKER_02]: FearTheClaw asks, well, sort of, because we mentioned it during release dates.

807
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,244
[SPEAKER_02]: FearTheClaw asks, I've never played Viva Pinata.

808
00:49:15,304 --> 00:49:15,744
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

809
00:49:15,804 --> 00:49:16,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really that bad?

810
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:18,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, where do we begin?

811
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:24,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Viva Pinata was Xbox 360's kind of foray to try and rip off Pokemon, in a way.

812
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:26,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily rip off, but... They went in at full bore.

813
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:28,214
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually did a TV show.

814
00:49:28,254 --> 00:49:29,315
[SPEAKER_02]: TV show, everything.

815
00:49:29,776 --> 00:49:30,016
[SPEAKER_08]: You know...

816
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:33,799
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem was, the game was too complicated for seven-year-olds to understand.

817
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the teenagers and adults that wanted to play it, it was a little bit too much of a kid game.

818
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:40,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So the original's not bad.

819
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:43,607
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad game by any means, especially considering how cheap you can find it now.

820
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But the sequel, Viva Piñata Party Animals, that's bad.

821
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that wasn't even the same type of game.

822
00:49:49,472 --> 00:49:49,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

823
00:49:50,373 --> 00:49:54,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Vivo Pinata, Trouble in Paradise Vivo Pinata, Trouble in Paradise

824
00:50:11,528 --> 00:50:37,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in other news, and this actually specifically goes for folks in Chandler, Arizona, at the McCullough Price House, there's a, I don't know if this is still going on, but it was going on as of the first, but an exhibit that's ancient history of video games, specifically on 70s consoles, and they are all set up to where, first of all, for games that didn't require electricity, like Lincoln Logs.

825
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:40,758
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a game!

826
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:19,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to, it actually, as it started there, it actually moved on through towards more modern era systems, too.

827
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:22,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I guess, to show how video gaming has evolved.

828
00:51:23,566 --> 00:51:32,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were having a lot of people bring in their private collections to loan some of their systems in for the project.

829
00:51:32,132 --> 00:51:36,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, sort of like how our Classic Gaming Expo was, if you remember that.

830
00:51:37,015 --> 00:51:39,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, it sounds like the museum at Classic Gaming Expo.

831
00:51:39,617 --> 00:51:48,999
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I think it was like, but it even had a full 80s era arcade that had a bunch of games and exhibits set up.

832
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,159
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all on free play.

833
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

834
00:51:54,680 --> 00:52:03,702
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's still going on, though, if anyone lives in or near Chandler, Arizona, we would definitely appreciate if you would actually go get us some pictures from this.

835
00:52:04,651 --> 00:52:04,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

836
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:06,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We like pictures.

837
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:06,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

838
00:52:07,053 --> 00:52:08,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd appreciate it if you stole something for me.

839
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, remember.

840
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:12,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But we didn't tell you to do it.

841
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:20,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, if you value your soul, don't bother playing the Fairchild Channel F. It sucks.

842
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:20,985
[SPEAKER_11]: So noted.

843
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:22,166
[SPEAKER_11]: So noted.

844
00:52:22,446 --> 00:52:23,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Duly noted.

845
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Music Monsters is a new music game developed by publisher Joe Wood.

846
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:29,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It combines Owen Dunn with Jam Sessions and Band Brothers.

847
00:52:48,272 --> 00:53:17,322
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's kind of neat you have like that could be neat it's it's basically the gameplay is just like owned on there's little circles that you see that appear you have to tap with your stylus but as stuff goes along it's kind of walking you through playing like music on like uh they have like a harpsichord and then it goes to like this weird tripped out guitar thing and as you're playing the game um it will it's kind of like beatmania a little bit almost too where you like you'll play the you know guitar part then you play a keyboard part etc but they have like stuff in there there is um

848
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:21,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there was a Depeche Mode song in there.

849
00:53:21,379 --> 00:53:22,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

850
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:32,325
[SPEAKER_08]: The ones I saw in there, also, other than that, Final Countdown, and there was the, was it Pneuma Pneuma or something like that?

851
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:33,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

852
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:36,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the song that the fat kid dances to in that YouTube video?

853
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:37,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.

854
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

855
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:40,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Those were, yeah, in there as well.

856
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So, no word on when that's coming out, though, yet.

857
00:53:46,454 --> 00:53:46,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Soon.

858
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:47,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully soon.

859
00:53:47,594 --> 00:53:48,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the, you know,

860
00:53:49,454 --> 00:53:50,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Halloween Time, or something like that.

861
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:20,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

862
00:54:33,678 --> 00:54:34,318
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.

863
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:35,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it.

864
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:38,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, also a quote from Teasdale.

865
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,322
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also secured what I can easily say is the best set list I've ever seen in a music game.

866
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:45,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really, sir?

867
00:54:45,343 --> 00:54:48,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some of that best set list apparently leaked out this week.

868
00:54:48,444 --> 00:54:50,045
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, YG4 TV.

869
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:50,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gotta love them.

870
00:54:51,425 --> 00:54:51,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Except not.

871
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:56,427
[SPEAKER_02]: In their show X-Play, they were showing a little clip of Rock Band 2 the day it was announced.

872
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:57,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the thing.

873
00:54:57,548 --> 00:55:01,009
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know how to pause your screen at just the right moment, guess what?

874
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:03,411
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see part of the song list.

875
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:12,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And it includes, let's see, Dream Theater, System of a Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Kim Wilde, Kids in America.

876
00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:13,075
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a DDR song.

877
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:17,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Motorhead, Cheap Trick, Journey.

878
00:55:18,117 --> 00:55:19,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Wynn.

879
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:22,880
[SPEAKER_02]: The Who, Pinball Wizard Sweet!

880
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,701
[SPEAKER_07]: Everlong Fuck yes

881
00:55:49,918 --> 00:55:53,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Rage Against the Machine, The Guess Who, Lenny Kravitz.

882
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:55,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be either one because American Woman is the song.

883
00:55:56,284 --> 00:55:57,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Billy Idol, White Wedding.

884
00:55:57,886 --> 00:55:58,807
[SPEAKER_02]: That is badass.

885
00:55:59,307 --> 00:56:01,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Alanis Morissette, You Ought to Know.

886
00:56:01,309 --> 00:56:02,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought I'd see that in a music game.

887
00:56:02,951 --> 00:56:03,692
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be awesome.

888
00:56:03,952 --> 00:56:05,033
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite.

889
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:06,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought I'd see her in a video game.

890
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Jethro Tull.

891
00:56:07,735 --> 00:56:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

892
00:56:08,176 --> 00:56:09,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Aqualung.

893
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:09,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Aqualung.

894
00:56:11,427 --> 00:56:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: either the Thin Lizzy or Joan Jett version of Bad Reputation Alice in Chains get this, even gets better this is where I start to go, this is too good Soundgarden with Spoonman and get this Jamie, this is the best ever Radiohead?

895
00:56:27,077 --> 00:56:38,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Not quite because you can use your Radiohead download content at least The Go-Go's, we got the beat I think I'm going to take the Alice in Chains with a big grain of salt because the song featured is Man in a Box I don't know how they would censor that

896
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:41,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they censored in the regular game.

897
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:41,904
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.

898
00:56:42,604 --> 00:56:43,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it doesn't matter.

899
00:56:43,545 --> 00:56:44,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Journey is there.

900
00:56:44,285 --> 00:56:45,546
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an automatic win.

901
00:56:45,646 --> 00:56:46,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Automatic win!

902
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Say no more.

903
00:56:48,587 --> 00:56:50,528
[SPEAKER_07]: You had me at Journey.

904
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:53,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Proof that flutes do belong in a rock band.

905
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Jethro Tull for the win.

906
00:56:55,731 --> 00:56:55,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

907
00:56:57,862 --> 00:57:02,266
[SPEAKER_02]: and HitStunInChat says, actually, yeah, I'd play that Alanis Morissette guitar part.

908
00:57:02,806 --> 00:57:04,447
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like her most rockin' song.

909
00:57:04,467 --> 00:57:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be great for a rock band.

910
00:57:06,769 --> 00:57:08,771
[SPEAKER_02]: And DreadlockLord says, are these rock bands?

911
00:57:09,231 --> 00:57:10,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, some greats in there.

912
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't believe that she wrote that song about Dave Coulier.

913
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:16,277
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about Like a Prayer?

914
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:17,518
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I hope not.

915
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:27,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never in my life gotten over that Did you see the other one?

916
00:57:27,688 --> 00:57:35,492
[SPEAKER_02]: The other rumored track list or whatever So we've gone from little grain of salt to medium sized grain of salt to now big grain of salt

917
00:57:35,632 --> 00:57:37,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is big grain assault.

918
00:57:38,773 --> 00:57:40,754
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some leaked track lists.

919
00:57:41,094 --> 00:57:46,495
[SPEAKER_08]: First one, I guess, is from some guy named Demp, a commenter on 8-Bit Fix.

920
00:57:47,155 --> 00:57:53,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And he says he's got, I guess, someone that saw it via an email source or something like that.

921
00:57:54,077 --> 00:57:56,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, it's like a fourth-hand hearsay, they said.

922
00:57:58,039 --> 00:57:59,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's some of the tracks that...

923
00:57:59,739 --> 00:58:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, Beastie Boys.

924
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:06,583
[SPEAKER_08]: ACDC, Let There Be Rock, AFI, Alanis Morissette, which you ought to know on there.

925
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:10,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just read the important ones.

926
00:58:10,885 --> 00:58:18,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Beastie Boys, Beck, Blondie, Devo, The Donnas, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac.

927
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,190
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is too good to be true.

928
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,350
[SPEAKER_02]: If that is the real list...

929
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Set Match Survivor, Eye of the Tiger

930
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:50,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Presidents of the USA with Lump.

931
00:58:50,713 --> 00:58:51,033
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

932
00:58:52,593 --> 00:58:53,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Bon Jovi.

933
00:58:53,874 --> 00:58:55,215
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is a fanboy list.

934
00:58:55,255 --> 00:58:55,775
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be.

935
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,416
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a real one, I am so sold.

936
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,778
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be good.

937
00:59:00,898 --> 00:59:01,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

938
00:59:01,818 --> 00:59:04,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you it's only a few more weeks away, E3.

939
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,900
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to announce some stuff about it.

940
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,623
[SPEAKER_08]: There was also some rumors that there's going to be some additional hardware, optional hardware stuff for you.

941
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:15,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if like effector pedals or something like that that's going to be involved, but...

942
00:59:16,297 --> 00:59:17,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell Me Baby, Snow, Heyo, Rush

943
00:59:40,134 --> 00:59:41,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Closer to the Heart, and Working Man.

944
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:42,595
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome.

945
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:43,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, The Who.

946
00:59:44,616 --> 00:59:50,258
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going to try to get the entire album, Who's Next, but unfortunately the master recordings weren't all available, so you get something even better.

947
00:59:50,578 --> 00:59:53,819
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a best of The Who, and it's a ton of freaking songs.

948
00:59:53,879 --> 01:00:05,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing Journey, Baba O'Reilly, Behind Blue Eyes, Eminence Front, Going Mobile, Leaving Here, Real Good Lookin' Boy, Sea and Sand, Who Are You, and live versions of My Generation, Summertime Blues, and Young Man Blues.

949
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:08,945
[SPEAKER_02]: So for Who fans, you're ready to go with that.

950
01:00:08,965 --> 01:00:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta ask, where are you from?

951
01:00:09,585 --> 01:00:11,006
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, you have more Rock Band news, right?

952
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:29,585
[SPEAKER_01]: That I do, Mr. Rob.

953
01:00:30,726 --> 01:00:32,488
[SPEAKER_01]: As in, we played a bunch of it at my house.

954
01:00:32,548 --> 01:00:33,689
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.

955
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:38,993
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a number of bands that are in talks to do different music games.

956
01:00:41,135 --> 01:00:44,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Frontline Music Label, of course, has Aerosmith.

957
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:52,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other groups in talks are Guns N' Roses and Van Halen, who are wanting to put out music games.

958
01:00:54,065 --> 01:01:23,074
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's also the Eagles and Steely Dan have agreements in the works so we might be seeing quite a number of other really big names but there's actually one group that's never going to do it and that's Led Zeppelin because they don't want anyone to touch the master recordings I think they're just being bitches about it How about you?

959
01:01:24,332 --> 01:01:27,936
[SPEAKER_08]: They're bitches.

960
01:01:28,276 --> 01:01:29,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see here.

961
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:44,692
[SPEAKER_08]: In other news, completely unrelated to Rock Band, Firmware 2.40 for the PlayStation 3 was released last week and immediately pulled back down because there were some issues with it.

962
01:01:45,232 --> 01:01:58,262
[SPEAKER_08]: But 2.4, of course, as you may remember, was the one introducing the brand new trophy system, as well as in-game cross-media bar and, you know, custom soundtracks and all that fun stuff.

963
01:02:00,143 --> 01:02:00,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

964
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:08,490
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, there's obviously a problem, and they're working on fixing it, and hopefully it'll be up again soon.

965
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:09,851
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

966
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,629
[SPEAKER_08]: There was some other stuff I heard about that.

967
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:15,891
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of interesting, though.

968
01:02:16,412 --> 01:02:22,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they have some updates already for some of the older games that have come out to add trophies to them, which is pretty cool.

969
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:23,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

970
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:28,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I think right now these trophies don't really mean much to me until I think Home comes out, and then you can actually display them.

971
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,002
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh, hey guys, we fucked it up.

972
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:31,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try again.

973
01:02:33,023 --> 01:02:37,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I saw Scott Rubin was having some issues with 2.4.

974
01:02:40,387 --> 01:03:04,291
[SPEAKER_02]: and we got in chat Rob with 2B says thank god I waited to download it and Zappy says it's fine I've used it since Wednesday so it sounds like the problem is sporadic or what if it's a certain model of PS3s that's having the issues because you know they've had different types they've had you know the ones that can play PS2 games the ones that can play so alright so did you check out the firmware yourself Loki?

975
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:06,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I skipped out for a minute nope not having it?

976
01:03:07,052 --> 01:03:07,212
[SPEAKER_08]: nope

977
01:03:08,621 --> 01:03:14,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really care because I haven't played a game on my PS3 for a long time.

978
01:03:14,944 --> 01:03:17,064
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think my PS3's been on in like three weeks.

979
01:03:17,745 --> 01:03:18,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it for movies.

980
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:21,766
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next game that we're getting is the initial D game anyway.

981
01:03:22,346 --> 01:03:22,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

982
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:28,549
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the trophies that are going to be the big part of 2.4 whenever they get the working version out...

983
01:03:30,279 --> 01:03:39,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, there was an earlier statement that every game would actually have trophies in it, but that probably only meant the actual first-party games, because you know what?

984
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:45,104
[SPEAKER_02]: The third-party publishers, some of them say they're not going to go back and put trophies in the games because they've moved on to bigger and better things.

985
01:03:45,724 --> 01:03:54,747
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, Insomniac, one of the bigger developers, they are focusing on Resistance 2, which I guess that would actually be a first-party, because Insomniac developed the game for Sony, huh?

986
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:54,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

987
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:58,150
[SPEAKER_02]: They are focusing on Resistance 2.

988
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:02,654
[SPEAKER_02]: They are not going to be putting trophies in Resistance or Ratchet & Clank Future.

989
01:04:03,094 --> 01:04:04,475
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not their biggest priority right now.

990
01:04:04,496 --> 01:04:05,617
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt says, the trophies are a lie.

991
01:04:11,286 --> 01:04:11,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.

992
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:17,131
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, also adding to the list, Call of Duty 4, Civilization Revolution.

993
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:19,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Not right now for trophies.

994
01:04:19,432 --> 01:04:20,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in the future.

995
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:22,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless they're yanking our chain, which is possible.

996
01:04:23,035 --> 01:04:23,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

997
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:26,518
[SPEAKER_02]: But I somehow doubt it.

998
01:04:26,798 --> 01:04:29,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, you guys here in studio, what do you think about trophies?

999
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something needed or is it just like whatever or what?

1000
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:37,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of neat, but I haven't even really figured out what all that means.

1001
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:39,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's different trophies you can get.

1002
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,804
[SPEAKER_08]: There are different bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.

1003
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,829
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what any of it means yet because I haven't played a game that uses them.

1004
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:47,270
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1005
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:49,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Upload since they're shiny.

1006
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:13,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when Home comes out, who knows?

1007
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:18,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Resistance 2 I'm definitely going to buy, but... Xenocore has a good point in chat.

1008
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Ratchet and Clank has its own trophy system.

1009
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't need the ones on the PS3.

1010
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,761
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru says, trophies like achievements are meh.

1011
01:05:25,161 --> 01:05:29,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tigerclaw says, geez, just when we have to deal with achievement whores, now we've got to deal with trophy whores.

1012
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:31,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait until those houses open up in Home.

1013
01:05:31,704 --> 01:05:32,944
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you're going to see the trophy whores.

1014
01:05:32,964 --> 01:05:34,985
[SPEAKER_07]: My Billy has gotten all these trophies.

1015
01:05:35,005 --> 01:05:36,505
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you're going to see the trophy whores.

1016
01:05:36,865 --> 01:05:38,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but you've still got no life, huh?

1017
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,041
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1018
01:06:06,992 --> 01:06:07,193
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 points.

1019
01:06:16,286 --> 01:06:20,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ristar, which is a platform game that was done by Sonic Team.

1020
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:27,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you play it, you will notice quite a number of similarities to the Sonic games.

1021
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:29,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a number of them.

1022
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:43,235
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is... It's this little star who runs around, and he can move across bars and things, like monkey bar-type hanging bars.

1023
01:06:44,155 --> 01:07:10,660
[SPEAKER_01]: and jump over things and shoot things well land on things really to kill them they're in a way but you go through different planets trying to to see you know trying to get through to I guess rescue the star goddess and I apologize guys for some reason we don't have the music tonight I don't know what is causing I may have to close Justin TV to do that but we don't have music tonight and I don't know why

1024
01:07:11,789 --> 01:07:13,170
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1025
01:07:28,513 --> 01:07:32,234
[SPEAKER_06]: This was an unlock in one of the Sonic collections?

1026
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:32,914
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.

1027
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:36,955
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the Sonic Mega Collection Plus on PC.

1028
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:37,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1029
01:07:37,735 --> 01:07:40,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And had a Game Gear release, too.

1030
01:07:41,315 --> 01:07:49,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available on the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, and also available on the Virtual Console.

1031
01:07:50,657 --> 01:07:53,478
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you go through the game, your health is actually registered in...

1032
01:07:55,018 --> 01:07:58,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Starz, and each hit is one star.

1033
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:58,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that good?

1034
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:03,004
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the little theme song, because sadly, Rystar wouldn't work.

1035
01:08:03,144 --> 01:08:03,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.

1036
01:08:04,825 --> 01:08:11,769
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also, as you gain momentum in running, you get sparks of stars that go behind you.

1037
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:13,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Shooting Star.

1038
01:08:13,491 --> 01:08:17,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can fly in different directions.

1039
01:08:17,553 --> 01:08:20,675
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a pretty neat little game.

1040
01:08:21,996 --> 01:08:25,479
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some differences from the Japanese and English versions.

1041
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:28,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Planets had different names in the English version.

1042
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:34,864
[SPEAKER_01]: The English one, in the Japanese one, he ran around with a very happy face the whole time except during a boss battle.

1043
01:08:35,345 --> 01:08:40,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the American one, they gave him the angry face the entire time that he had during the boss battles.

1044
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:46,932
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also a skiing sequence that was added to level 5 in the US one.

1045
01:08:49,093 --> 01:08:52,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Ito Mori was a giant cat in the Japanese version with a change for an ice monster.

1046
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,897
[SPEAKER_01]: There's anti-gravity shoes in round 6.

1047
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Different treasure names.

1048
01:08:57,879 --> 01:09:06,724
[SPEAKER_01]: The European version of Ristar actually took advantage of larger resolutions that were available on PAL systems.

1049
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:17,531
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually the third game on the Game Gear version is if you play the Japanese version on an American Game Gear, the third stage is missing.

1050
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:20,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It just vanished.

1051
01:09:21,143 --> 01:09:21,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Went away.

1052
01:09:21,683 --> 01:09:22,083
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.

1053
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:35,866
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, if you play Burning Street that was on Genesis, if you put your Japanese cartridge into a US system, either by a converter or whatever, it changes the street to Rage.

1054
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:38,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1055
01:09:39,106 --> 01:09:41,027
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was put out by Acclaim.

1056
01:09:42,087 --> 01:09:42,847
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty fun.

1057
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:43,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1058
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:44,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It got a 9.5 by GameSpot.

1059
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:54,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Rystar is your classic game of the week, and you can check that out on just about any Sonic Mega Collection that's out there.

1060
01:09:54,454 --> 01:09:55,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonic Team!

1061
01:09:55,474 --> 01:10:00,617
[SPEAKER_02]: GameGuru is clarifying Rystar was available on all the Sonic Mega Collections, GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

1062
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:01,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's out there, waiting for you.

1063
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:04,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Sonic Team game, it may as well be Sonic.

1064
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:08,222
[SPEAKER_02]: And sadly, it's the only way you're going to hear the music, thanks to our failure this week.

1065
01:10:09,269 --> 01:10:10,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on and find it.

1066
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:18,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to mention there was another game that they had gameplay footage of come out this week and that would be Wario Land Shake It.

1067
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:22,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's funny is that game looks very much like Sonic.

1068
01:10:24,006 --> 01:10:24,387
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird.

1069
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:26,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be interesting.

1070
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:28,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be very interesting.

1071
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:40,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well, that's going to do it here for Part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back with plenty more, and we've got some fun stuff planned for Part B. We're going to play the match game tonight with all these people in the house.

1072
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:42,083
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's going to be fun.

1073
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:47,366
[SPEAKER_02]: One chatter and one caller will get to go head-to-head in the OLR match game, and plenty more gaming news.

1074
01:10:47,386 --> 01:10:53,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't even touched barely the Xbox 360 and some other stuff, but we'll get to all that when we come back after this break.

1075
01:10:53,950 --> 01:11:03,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
