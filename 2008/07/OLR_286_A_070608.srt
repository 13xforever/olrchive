00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,280
Tonight, July 6th, 2008, a 16-bit RPG classic is being redone for the DS, Rock Band 2 leaks

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:31,560
at the internet, and could a popular racing game soon take on airplanes?

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,560
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Radio.

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,680
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
lifestyle.

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,880
My name is Rob Roberts.

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,920
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,920
Hi.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,320
How are you, Jamie?

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,600
I don't know.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,560
It's very, very hot here in the studio in Sacramento.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,320
I swear if it gets above like 100, the little temperature thing he says is 99 degrees right

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
now.

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,200
If we were to hit 100, we would have to call a heat day, I think.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Yeah.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
It's just very crazy.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,320
But we're doing what we can to cool off down here in studio, but it's kind of a mess tonight.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
Also joining us, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,360
See, my computer room's normally about this temperature anyways because of, you know,

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
my high end computer.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
It blows out so much hot air.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,000
Even with the air conditioning on, it's a good 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
house.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,400
And then if I'm like recording video on my Xbox 360, that being as small as it is still

27
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,720
kicks out about as much heat too, so that really sucks.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,280
All right.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,840
Well, we've got lots and lots and lots of people here in studio tonight, and it's kind

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,960
of strange because, like, you know, we have our six year anniversary of Orange Orleans

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,920
Radio and frickin' nobody shows up.

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,320
We have a visitor come in from out of town, suddenly my garage is frickin' full, standing

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,320
room only.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
What the hell is this?

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
All right.

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,720
So say hello tonight in order of importance.

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,280
Say hello first off to Intern Drew.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
What's up?

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
How you doing, Drew?

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm doing pretty good.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
All right.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
I gotta make sure.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
Are we hearing Intern Drew tonight?

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I don't know.

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
Are we hearing Intern Drew?

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Yes, I think we are.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Barely, although that's very quiet.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
I don't know.

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Do I have the sensitive mic tonight?

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Maybe I do.

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
I don't know.

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Do I have the sensitive mic?

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't know.

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I don't know.

55
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Maybe I do.

56
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Live radio.

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
We're doing sound checks live on air.

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
What can you do?

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Sound check one, two.

60
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
All right.

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Anyhow.

62
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Look, when I talk, it makes little lines up here.

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Exactly.

64
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
That's the magic of radio.

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
You haven't figured that out after six years?

66
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
All right.

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,920
Also, say hello tonight to our website master.

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,800
Dark Tetsuya is here in studio.

69
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Amazing.

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Yeah, I know.

71
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I made it.

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,240
You live in town, and yet you never seem to make it over here, but here you are tonight.

73
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,560
Well, Drew said he was going to come and get me yesterday, so.

74
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Awesome.

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Here I am.

76
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
All right.

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Well, Dark Tetsuya is here.

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
We'll get him a little louder.

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,360
We're going to give him some mic lessons a little later.

80
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
It's all good.

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
It's been a while.

82
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,560
So he'll be here to comment on some of the news tonight, and then say hello to the one

83
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,920
and only joining us for all the way from New York freaking city, DJ Rama S is here in studio.

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
What's up, people?

85
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
How you doing?

86
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Hot.

87
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,280
Yeah, I know.

88
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,520
It doesn't look that hot when you see it on Justin TV.

89
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Does it?

90
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,940
No, but funny thing is I should be used to this heat, but still.

91
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,160
It's really bad tonight.

92
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,280
Like, we may have to take a heat break in the middle of part A just to kind of like

93
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
cool.

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I'm serious.

95
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Like, it's sad.

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Don't laugh at me.

97
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Huh?

98
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
We'll have to get the Gatorade.

99
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
Seriously.

100
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
It's pretty bad in here tonight.

101
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,240
And I don't want Jamie to die live on air.

102
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
That would be horrific.

103
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't want to die on air either.

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So we might take a heat break in the middle of part A.

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to die on bacon.

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,160
Alright, say hello as well.

108
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,680
The good news is, since we broadcast at six o'clock, you know, the heat reaches its peak

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,920
around five o'clock, so it should be cooling off, thankfully, throughout the night.

110
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,260
Alright, say hello as well to, um, well, wait.

111
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,600
I guess we're not in order of importance anymore, because she'd be on the bottom of the list.

112
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Rice Princess!

113
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Wait, aren't I on the bottom anyway?

114
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
Aren't I the last person?

115
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
I don't know.

116
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
I'm just messing with you.

117
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Shut your face, Rob.

118
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Alright.

119
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
How are you, Miss Princess?

120
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Mad at you now.

121
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
No, you love me.

122
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
No, I don't.

123
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Alright.

124
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Alright.

125
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,960
So we have a very full house tonight, just lots and lots of people to comment on the

126
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,280
news tonight, and of course, you, in our chat room, chat.orangelaungeradio.com, we got lots

127
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,360
of people in chat tonight, we have stickax282, who says, I'm kind of new here to this whole

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
live thing.

129
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,280
Boy, did you pick a shitty show to have as your first show, because it's gonna be chaotic

130
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
tonight.

131
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Um, but welcome.

132
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,360
Shadow Charlie says, holy crap, it's Rama.

133
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Holy crap indeed.

134
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
There it is.

135
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,040
Jamie says, somebody dying live on air sounds exciting.

136
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,480
You know, I think it's one of those things that's better when you're at home watching,

137
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,560
but if you're like, live in studio, and considering the fact it's Jamie, and it would kinda, like,

138
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't want Jamie to die.

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I mean, Jamie said some things that have made me angry before, but I don't want her to die.

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,720
Heart.

141
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,960
I guess Jamie has died, and the ferret has taken over tonight.

142
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Alright.

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,880
No, Jamie is alive and very well, and wants to talk to you all about her gaming week.

144
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,520
How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

145
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Um, I played Black Knight 2000.

146
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,200
It's imbalanced, but I managed to replay on my first ball, and that's the only time I've

147
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,640
ever done well on that game in my life.

148
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,640
I also played pinball at the House of Dark Soccer this week, and your pinball machines

149
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,080
like made it or something, it's like they grew.

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,280
It's been crazy.

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,200
We moved the wide bodies out into the garage, and we have both the Black Knight machines

152
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:46,640
inside, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, Simpsons Pinball Party, No Fear, and World

153
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,160
Cup Soccer in the house, and everything else that's outside.

154
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
Dan's working on our friend's Indiana Jones machine.

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,640
Yeah, I was gonna say, when I was there, I saw an Indiana Jones machine that was being

156
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
worked on.

157
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,840
Yes, I actually ate a cookie off the Indiana Jones machine, it was pretty awesome.

158
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,000
It was very delicious.

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They were mint cookies.

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,880
Yes, it was very delicious.

161
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,880
Orange Lounge Fudio!

162
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Alright, anything else that you played with your week?

163
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,960
Any de-essing?

164
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,600
I played traffic a lot, and I played Getting Lost to San Francisco.

165
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
You played in traffic?

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,640
I played driving.

167
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,240
A lot of people tell me to go play in traffic, but I've never actually played in traffic.

168
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,440
I played Initial D, for real.

169
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,080
No, it was on the freeway, so it was more like one gun.

170
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Awesome.

171
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Awesome.

172
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,400
Alright, let's go around the studio and see what everybody else has been playing.

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,680
I will start with the guests tonight, I'll be nice, and Loki and I will go last.

174
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,120
Who has the mic for you kids over there?

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,240
Rice Princess, since you were on the bottom last time, why don't you start off, how was

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,240
your gaming week?

177
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Non-existent.

178
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Next.

179
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Wow, you're boring.

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,820
Alright, Rama, how was your gaming week?

181
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,820
It was tolerable.

182
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,840
I played Super Mario Kart DS on the plane ride coming in, and throughout the week on

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,120
the subway, I was playing Custom Robo Arena, which has really become one of my favorite

184
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
games.

185
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Interesting.

186
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,400
Tell us a little bit about Custom Robo Arena, I don't think I've ever heard of it.

187
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,800
Well, basically, Custom Robo Arena is like a Pokemon-ish type game, where you get this

188
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,240
little cube as a robot, and you customize it with different parts, and you battle with

189
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
it.

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,760
And one part of the style is like cleaning up your robot, because throughout the game,

191
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,880
if you're running around with a dirty robot, nobody wants to fight with you.

192
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,160
Is it like a Tamagotchi, where it'll poop randomly and you have to clean it up?

193
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Mm-hmm.

194
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,800
Sounds awesome.

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
Sounds very awesome.

196
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Not bad for $9.99, so hey.

197
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
There you go.

198
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,240
There you go.

199
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,640
What is this, Rama, before we keep the mic moving, I wanted to say, you also host your

200
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
own podcast, correct?

201
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Do you want to give it a plug?

202
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Yes, I do.

203
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:51,000
I host a podcast called Anime Jam Session with me, DJ Rama S, and one of my good friends,

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Kuro Usagi.

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,360
We record Tuesday or Wednesday nights.

206
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,880
We try to get it out on our feed Thursday or Friday, so if you want to check it out,

207
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,280
you can go over to djramas.net or feedburner.com slash anime jam session, and we'll put it

208
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
out.

209
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Awesome.

210
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,440
I want to apologize for the audio quality you've been hearing in the first little bits

211
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
of the show, too.

212
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,520
I think the mics got switched, and the guests got the mic with a very low gain, and I got

213
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,940
the one with a very high gain, so I was very loud, and they were very quiet, but we've

214
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,280
switched some things over here on the board.

215
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,920
I ninja'd over to the board and switched some things while they were talking about their

216
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,160
gaming Wii, so hopefully it's getting a little better.

217
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
We'll see as we move on, and Dark Tetsuya, how was your gaming Wii?

218
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
What have you been playing?

219
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Oh, just a lot of Need for Speed Carbon.

220
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,480
I actually beat it, but I went back and did some of the challenges to unlock some more

221
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,480
stuff.

222
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,760
Now, don't you have a Justin TV channel or something where people can actually watch

223
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
you play games?

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,440
I stream random emulators and stuff.

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
What kind of games can people see if they check you out on the Justin TV?

226
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,200
Well, I'm working on Zelda right now.

227
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm waiting to do Death Mountain.

228
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,520
Nice.

229
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,640
You know, I was actually on Justin TV very randomly one night, and you might not know

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,800
what Dark Tetsuya, but I was watching you.

231
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
That's the thing about Justin TV is you can actually watch people, and they never know.

232
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Oh, yeah.

233
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,280
You were playing La Mulana, and that was actually the first time I'd ever seen it, so it was

234
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
cool.

235
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
I actually got to check that out.

236
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,840
It does look very retro.

237
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I can see why people are really into that game.

238
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
Oh, yeah.

239
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Very cool.

240
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
All right.

241
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,840
And you do not host your own podcast right now, right?

242
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
No, not at the moment.

243
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Not at the moment.

244
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,840
All right.

245
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,840
Drew.

246
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,280
Intern Drew, do you host a podcast, for heaven's sake, or be honest?

247
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Not yet.

248
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
No.

249
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Oh, shit.

250
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
You got plans for one, don't you?

251
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
No, I'm not.

252
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,000
Any asshole with a mic can do a podcast in this day and age.

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Shit, look at us.

254
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
All right.

255
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right.

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
How was your gaming week?

258
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It was all right.

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I have one of those Korean free-to-play what's-its action RPG.

260
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I like that description.

261
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know how to classify it.

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,400
Korean free-to-play what's-it thingy-ma-bob guy.

263
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
I don't know how to describe it.

264
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,400
It's a platformer action game with RPG elements.

265
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:06,440
That, I've been playing some Fire Emblem 7, trying to actually beat it, which is brutal,

266
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,560
even on the first try.

267
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,080
And aside from that, I haven't been playing much.

268
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Weren't you, Captain Excitement?

269
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:22,560
I picked up Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 at a used bookstore the other day.

270
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,880
I can't get it to run.

271
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,880
It crashes.

272
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
Best ten bucks I ever spent.

273
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
Thank you, Ubisoft.

274
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
Now make your games work.

275
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Nice.

276
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,940
All right.

277
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,160
I guess that's gonna be, he's putting his mic down somewhat angrily, so, Loki, how was

278
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
your gaming week?

279
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
What did you play?

280
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,680
I'm trying to figure out which mic I'm supposed to be having here.

281
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
I think you're that one.

282
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,680
All right.

283
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,920
I didn't play too much this week, because I've been busy, and I did play, well, Grand

284
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,040
Theft Auto 4, which is not surprising.

285
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,640
I actually had some guests come over.

286
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,080
My sister hadn't seen Grand Theft Auto 4 yet, and she's a big fan of San Andreas, especially

287
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,640
running around aimlessly in the co-op mode.

288
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,380
So I showed her the swing set and other fun stuff about it, and she liked that.

289
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:16,320
And then I got to play a little bit of Defender Castle, and that was fun, and Mario Kart Wii.

290
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,080
We had to download a ton more Miis.

291
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,200
In fact, we got one that's got a crab on the person's face, which is kind of funny, and

292
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,020
it, like, pinches its claws.

293
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,360
And then there's also...

294
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Crab people!

295
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Yes, crab people.

296
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,640
And then one with Mickey Mouse, and, I don't know, we just downloaded a bunch of Miis and

297
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,920
then played at the levels with the Miis in the background, and that was funny.

298
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:46,080
And I just tried the homebrew Smash Bros. game that someone had made or worked on, and

299
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,640
I guess it's very early, because it's not very good right now, but, I mean, it's not...

300
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Needs work.

301
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,240
It's not even close to being started, let alone done, so, yeah.

302
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,240
So how was it for your week?

303
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,080
You had a pretty slow gaming week, all things considered, but you got other projects going

304
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
on, right?

305
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,840
Yeah, I'm busy, and then my car was in the shop, so...

306
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
Oh, fun.

307
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Yeah.

308
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Fun, fun.

309
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
You've had an exciting week.

310
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Not really.

311
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,280
Uh, let's see, my gaming week.

312
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,800
I got to play pinball at Dark Soccer's, which was pretty fun, I was mentioning that earlier.

313
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,160
She's got so many freaking pinball machines in her house, it's pretty funny.

314
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,080
And she's got, you know, the Black Knight 2000 I got to play for the first time.

315
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,540
I don't think I'd ever played that Black Knight table before, because what's really funny

316
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,840
about Jamie's house is that she has the Black Knight 2000 and the Black Knight right next

317
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
to each other.

318
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
So it's like...

319
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,880
Oh, but she's saying that she's borrowing the Black Knight, but it's still fun.

320
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Still fun.

321
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,720
Um, so pinball goodness at Dark Soccer's house.

322
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
And then, let's see, what else did I play?

323
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:51,680
I played World of Drama Craft, which was exciting this week, and also I played Guitar Hero Aerosmith

324
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,560
for the first time at Dark Soccer's party.

325
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,580
They had Guitar Hero Aerosmith going there.

326
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:01,800
It's Guitar Hero 3, but with Aerosmith songs, and totally reskinned for Aerosmith, so that's

327
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
pretty much it.

328
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,280
That's all you need to know about the game.

329
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,000
They really didn't change anything from guitar.

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,760
I mean, I guess little bits in the story mode and what have you, but honestly, it's just

331
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,060
Guitar Hero 3 with Aerosmith stuff.

332
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,700
But the songs were good, I mean, because Aerosmith's pretty good, but I still don't think I could

333
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,840
spend $60 on it.

334
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,320
I would have to really, really love Aerosmith to spend that much money on it.

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,280
Dan really loves Aerosmith.

336
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,640
So then it's worth it to Dan.

337
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
But we didn't buy it.

338
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Me?

339
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Guitar Hero Journey?

340
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
I would have dropped the $60.

341
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,880
I would have paid $100 for Guitar Hero Journey, but it's not Guitar Hero Journey.

342
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,640
It's Guitar Hero Aerosmith.

343
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,480
But it did motivate me to go back and actually play some Guitar Hero 3, and I still cannot

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
beat that freaking Slipknot song on hard.

345
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
The intro ticks me off.

346
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Did you download the free song?

347
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I did.

348
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,440
The Top Gun song is awesome.

349
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,680
I wish it was Danger Zone, but eh...

350
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
That's all right.

351
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
It's still...

352
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,240
What a great patriotic tune to have the Top Gun theme, although it did make me sad because

353
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,340
it made me think back to my birthday when the Top Gun ride wasn't working at Great America,

354
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,560
and that pissed me off a little.

355
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
But the song made it all better.

356
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,160
Yeah, the last thing we need is, you know, homoerotic volleyball scenes.

357
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,960
Yeah, so I love that.

358
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,120
But here's the thing about Guitar Hero, is that you really have to get over, like, two

359
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,320
skill humps, I don't know what you'd call them, little skill checks, to get better at

360
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Guitar Hero.

361
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Okay?

362
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,040
One of the skill checks is that you have to learn how to strum up and down.

363
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,160
Like, if you just strum down the whole time, you're not going to be able to hit notes fast

364
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,840
enough during some of the songs.

365
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
That's the first little plateau.

366
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,920
That's a good name.

367
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,400
That's the first plateau you have to learn across.

368
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,940
I am currently stuck on the second plateau of getting good at Guitar Hero, and that is

369
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,960
learning how you don't have to strum for every note.

370
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,720
If a note has a little white dot on it, or a rock band, it's a smaller note, if a note

371
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,640
has a little white dot on it, you only have to hit the button for that note if you hit

372
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,640
the note correctly at the start of the sequence.

373
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,040
Like, that's the part I'm having trouble kind of getting over, because I want to strum everything,

374
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
and it's hard to tell when the notes are going to be that fast, which ones you have to strum

375
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
and which ones you don't.

376
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,640
Does Guitar Hero people in chat know what I'm talking about?

377
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Please.

378
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Or do I just sound crazy?

379
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I don't know.

380
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Because everybody in the studio is looking at me like, huh?

381
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
What?

382
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Yeah, like the hammer-ons and stuff.

383
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Exactly.

384
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
And the tutorial does not explain it that well.

385
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,640
The tutorial explains a little bit about how you can, like, never mind, I'm not even going

386
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,060
to tell you how to explain it, but the tutorial doesn't explain it very well.

387
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,200
It's kind of something I had to learn on my own.

388
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,760
So there you have it.

389
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
All right.

390
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
Enough of my gaming week.

391
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
You guys don't care about my Guitar Hero progression.

392
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,720
Although, I did beat two new songs on Expert.

393
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Paint It Black.

394
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Awesome.

395
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
All right.

396
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,200
Soccer Max says hammer-ons and pull-offs.

397
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
That's it.

398
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Exactly.

399
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Yes, Rama.

400
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
What?

401
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Before we begin.

402
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Yes.

403
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
I have presents.

404
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Presents?

405
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
What a good way to start tonight's housekeeping.

406
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Oh, shit.

407
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,400
I love housekeepers that begin with presents.

408
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,680
First off, before the show, I was showing the people on Justin TV this, but Loki got

409
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,800
me some new floor mats with Hello Kitty on them, which is hilarious because I already

410
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,920
had ones with penguins on them.

411
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,520
So I'm going to figure out how to use them both.

412
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Maybe I'll put the ones with penguins out here or something.

413
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I got a t-shirt.

414
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Wipe your feet before you go in the house.

415
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I got the t-shirt.

416
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
You got a t-shirt, too?

417
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Oh, you have the t-shirt of Hot Topic.

418
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
I gun Liberty City.

419
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,960
I gun Liberty City instead of a heart.

420
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
But it's a gun.

421
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Lovely.

422
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Yes.

423
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
So, Rama, presents.

424
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
These are for you guys.

425
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,480
My official I love New York shirt.

426
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
That is very ironic.

427
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Wait.

428
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,600
Hold that up and then have Loki stand up again right next to it.

429
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Wait.

430
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
What the fuck?

431
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Seriously.

432
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
What the fuck?

433
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
I know.

434
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It's like a scene demo.

435
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
We have I gun Liberty City.

436
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Again, you can look at this on our Justin TV channel.

437
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,520
I just give you orange ones right here.

438
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,920
And I heart and Y.

439
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,000
So it's like you have the real thing and then the parody right next to each other.

440
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,200
That's wonderful.

441
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,520
I don't want to lie on a shirt.

442
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,000
You guys didn't plan that, did you?

443
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You have no choice.

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's amazing.

445
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well, that's great.

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Thank you so much for the shirts.

447
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Wow.

448
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's great.

449
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,560
I'll change into one right now, but not live on cam because that's kind of gross.

450
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
So thank you.

451
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Excellent.

452
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
I do heart and why I can't wait to go back.

453
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
So excellent.

454
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
All right.

455
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Everybody in chat rooms.

456
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Hello.

457
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Welling.

458
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,160
Sorry to those of you guys that listen on the podcast, but the nice thing, excuse me

459
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
about Justin TV is that people can highlight.

460
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,400
So I'm sure there will be a highlight of that clip later on.

461
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
SSJ 100.

462
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,000
Matt in chat says, and why represent, I'm sure he would say just like that too.

463
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey.

464
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey.

465
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,480
Ice skull pirates.

466
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Oh my God.

467
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
She is ice skull.

468
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Fuck pirates.

469
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,080
I mean, what's wrong with you and your wildest dreams.

470
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,920
I feel like I need an eye blank, something shirt to fit in pirates.

471
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
No comment.

472
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
What is that?

473
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,000
All right.

474
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
On the butt.

475
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It says pirates of the Caribbean.

476
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
All right.

477
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Housekeeping.

478
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,160
Um, what else?

479
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,600
I don't really have anything for the show.

480
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,400
We have no interviews coming up, which is kind of sad, but I will say this.

481
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,660
We always have our live journal community in the MySpace communities and Facebook, Facebook.

482
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,480
We are the O L army, O L R M Y if you want to look us up.

483
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,600
If you want to join us on live journal, orange lounge, no radio, just orange lounge is us

484
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,560
on live journal and on MySpace, we are orange lounge radio, three different names for three

485
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
different sites.

486
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
If we could be any more confusing.

487
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Good job.

488
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Standards department.

489
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,400
Don't confuse us with the group orange range or the group orange lounge for that matter.

490
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,720
Although I don't think has Tomosuke made an orange lounge song in like the past three

491
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
years.

492
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
I don't think he has.

493
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
Has he?

494
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
No.

495
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
So we own it now.

496
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
I think.

497
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
I think there's some rule now that we own orange lounge.

498
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
All right.

499
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Just kidding.

500
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
All right.

501
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,280
Let's get to tonight's gaming news and Loki's going to start us off tonight.

502
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,280
Yeah.

503
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,680
So more details about mega man nine.

504
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,200
It is going to be completely eight bit looking, including the very limited color palette as

505
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
well.

506
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
Uh, it's supposed to be also really fucking hard, just like, you know, most mega man games.

507
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,520
And in fact, uh, there was some, uh, hands on stuff, um, from like a joystick and some

508
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,840
other, um, groups out there including games, radar and stuff like that.

509
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,280
And basically seeing that they've, you know, a few run throughs on different levels and

510
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,040
it was damn near impossible, you know, kind of a famous puzzles from different games have

511
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
come back.

512
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:14,120
You know, the disappearing block, you know, um, platform puzzles and, uh, the one hit

513
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,040
kill, um, beams that go across.

514
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Okay.

515
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,120
I forgot to mention about my gaming week.

516
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,160
I've been playing mega man, um, collected main man anniversary collection and I'm starting

517
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,720
with mega man one, right?

518
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,360
I am about to pull my fucking hair out on the ice man level with those fucking blocks.

519
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,760
Whoever invented the block puzzles needs to burn in hell.

520
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
All right.

521
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,320
Once you get past the blocks, once you get past, then it only gets worse and mega man

522
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,360
two and the heat man stage, unless you have item two, unless you have item two, which

523
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
you ought to.

524
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Yeah, I know.

525
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,200
But seriously, until about the fifth game, the fifth NES game, I never thought a mega

526
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
man series is really that hard.

527
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,480
Rob, if you want to make everything easy on the first mega man, cut man.

528
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I did.

529
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,080
I have killed the cut man, elect man, guts man, bomb man.

530
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,360
I'm just, I got to get ice man now so I can get fire man.

531
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,880
And if all fails, sorry, if all fails, you got the rabbit start pause trick and I guess

532
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
that's true.

533
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,160
And the cool thing too, also, um, the game is supposed to be out by the end of the, well

534
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,480
actually the beginning of the fourth quarter in, um, September.

535
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,060
So that's going to be coming out in Japan.

536
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,680
I'm guessing probably in the U S around the same time, you know, so, uh, we have a crap

537
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,400
load of people in chat tonight.

538
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,740
Chat that orange launch radio.com game grew says Nintendo games should be Nintendo hard.

539
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,520
So with an eight big game should come that cause is it just, we're, we're eight big games

540
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,180
more difficult than they are today.

541
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,180
I think they are.

542
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
Yeah.

543
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,680
Uh, rice princess, are you excited about mega man nine and it's a increased difficulty or

544
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,680
what?

545
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,880
I am because I do not like the, uh, current incarnation of mega man.

546
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,200
I like the oldest.

547
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
You don't like legends.

548
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I love legends.

549
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,960
No, you don't like mega man X or any of that stuff.

550
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
They're okay.

551
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,460
No, I like the Nintendo mega man.

552
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,200
So this old school thing made you squee in many places, right?

553
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Yes.

554
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Good to hear.

555
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,880
I think they should just continue with making mega man games just like this.

556
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Just make them all a bit from now on.

557
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,480
And you know, if you want to do the 16 bit or the little, you know, higher graphics games,

558
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,520
just do like the mega man X series.

559
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,360
They have really too many series going on.

560
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,560
They have that ZX series now, and then they also have, um, star force and just bring back

561
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,160
legends, bring back the original eight bit mega man.

562
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,080
Well, they are, you get, you get in half of what you want, but they need to continue

563
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,440
and you know, one game is not bringing it back.

564
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,240
Um, I got to, I got to read some comments as well from Justin TV.

565
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,480
We have more people in Justin TV than I've ever seen before.

566
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
This is crazy.

567
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,160
Uh, illustrator says real fucking hard keeps the ignorant noobs away, but mega man nine

568
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,280
is not really a multiplayer game.

569
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
So who cares about noobs?

570
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,680
Let a noob, noob themselves in their own home.

571
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,120
It's supposed to be fucking hard and then you keep playing it until you can pass it

572
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
and then you become better.

573
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
You don't just go, Oh, I suck.

574
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,160
Move on to next game.

575
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,160
You know, as, as it was said before about leading noobs to water, most of, most of what

576
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,600
you get are wet noobs and now you're leading noobs to splash woman.

577
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes.

578
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
All right.

579
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Yeah.

580
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,640
You know, I think she's going to be a bit wet.

581
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Yes.

582
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,760
Oh, you're disgusting.

583
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,080
Maybe that's a little tagline on the poster.

584
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,900
This September's last woman gets wet.

585
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Are we explicit yet?

586
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Oh, we always are.

587
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
We all better be.

588
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
We always are.

589
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Fuck.

590
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Now we are.

591
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Thank you.

592
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
No, not necessarily.

593
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,200
You have to say it a few more times because I watched, fuck, fuckity fucker, fucker, fuck,

594
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
fuck, fuck.

595
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
There you go.

596
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,760
Cause I watched Hancock over the weekend and they did have fuck in there once, but it's

597
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
still PG-13.

598
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
But it's got cock in the title.

599
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,440
Because he should have cock in the title.

600
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
His name's John Hancock.

601
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,320
Is that the fuck show already?

602
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
Orange Lounge Cock-io.

603
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,320
No, it's the cock show.

604
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,840
All right.

605
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,840
Anyway, so Mega Man Nine's been dated for September as well, right?

606
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,160
Yes, that's what I already said.

607
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
I'm sorry.

608
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
I missed it.

609
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I was sleeping.

610
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,760
I was, I was thinking about Splash Woman's cock, um, cause you know, she probably had

611
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,320
one at some point, you know, doctor, uh, Dr. Wily has his leftover parts.

612
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Anyhow.

613
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,800
You know, you know, what is it by with, with, with Wily and making every single one of his

614
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
robots male?

615
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Hmm.

616
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,920
You think he's got a little secret?

617
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,200
Now he's branching out.

618
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
But he, but.

619
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Is it sexist?

620
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Dark soccer?

621
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
No, it's bi.

622
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Is it sexist?

623
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
No.

624
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,720
Cause see, Dr. Wily likes little boys and, but that's okay because so does Dr. Light

625
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,080
and Dr. Light also likes little girls.

626
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
What the hell is wrong with this show?

627
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,200
For real?

628
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,400
I'm clicking unsubscribe right now.

629
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Click.

630
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
That was disgusting.

631
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,600
So you're saying Dr. Wily's a member of the Catholic church?

632
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,680
God, Chris Hansen's going to be here any minute.

633
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

634
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Take a seat.

635
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Take a seat.

636
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,240
Ah shit, you already took a seat.

637
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,520
Because I don't think there's any altar girls.

638
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
So he's probably Presbyterian.

639
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:11,920
All right, look, let's go, let's go to a much cleaner, safer, kid-friendly game.

640
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,240
Animal Crossing, Animal Crossing.

641
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,720
There has been a teaser in the latest official Nintendo magazine over in the UK.

642
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,200
And if you look at the magazine scan that's floating around the internet, or if you actually

643
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,440
own the magazine, it says, it's been a while.

644
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,640
It's time to revisit an old friend.

645
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,520
How's your village doing these days?

646
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,800
That is a, it just has a little picture from Animal Crossing and has that quote.

647
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,880
Could that be a hint that we get Animal Crossing 83?

648
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,520
I bet, I bet, I bet, I bet.

649
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
What?

650
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,000
I have thought that it's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions.

651
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,160
The Wii one's going to make everyone use their GameCube versions, why?

652
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,960
I think it's going to make you load your GameCube village.

653
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,400
Oh, maybe that's why the quote saying, how's your village doing all these days?

654
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,280
In other words, you better go pull some fucking weeds or you're in for it when the new game

655
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
comes out.

656
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Shit, yeah.

657
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,920
It means I better go get my memory card back from my friend who was taking care of my village

658
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
for me.

659
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
It wasn't me, was it?

660
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
No.

661
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
No?

662
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
No.

663
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,920
That'd be funny is like the reason they're saying that they're all, yeah, you should

664
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,680
really go back and check how your village is doing because you're not getting a new

665
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
game.

666
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
Better go back and play the old one.

667
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,000
That might be the joke.

668
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Rob.

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
What?

670
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I've got the Japanese one too.

671
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
I got a new memory card.

672
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,440
I lost my old village.

673
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,480
I can't find it, but I have a new memory card.

674
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,920
So I'm thinking about making like OLR town and maybe playing it on Justin TV and letting

675
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
the chatters.

676
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
You can do that, Rob.

677
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Yeah.

678
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
Let the chatters name.

679
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
For real.

680
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
We'll do that.

681
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Because we have to have, who was the, who was the lesbian?

682
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I don't remember.

683
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
She lived in my village.

684
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
There was a lesbian that lived in the village.

685
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
Yes.

686
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,920
I remember.

687
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,700
Her whole house was a gym and she was our resident lesbian, so we put a nice little

688
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,700
rainbow sign in the side of her house.

689
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,400
So we put a gay pride flag in front of her house and then she moved.

690
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Yes.

691
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,720
And we ended up setting the, the, the, the pattern up and every time we visited.

692
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,080
Didn't we have her saying like, I like boobs as a little thing?

693
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Yeah.

694
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Animal Crossing is so awesome.

695
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,240
Someone went around going cock.

696
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,520
Um, SS2-100 Matt says the question is if Rob and Irene will quit WoW to play Animal Crossing

697
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Wii.

698
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Uh, yes.

699
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
Yeah, right.

700
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,280
Rice princess says she already has.

701
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,080
Are you getting a head start on only village?

702
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,440
Only if they'll bat me wool.

703
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
All right.

704
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,040
It is a 12 step recovery program.

705
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,040
All right.

706
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
It is a 12 step recovery program.

707
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Well, we'll see.

708
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,040
E3 is coming very soon.

709
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Yeah.

710
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
Well, pulling the plug is a one step recovery program.

711
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,160
I have my fingers and toes and other parts crossed that Animal Crossing will be an announcement

712
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
at E3.

713
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,480
So we'll see.

714
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
We shall see.

715
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,840
Let's move on with other news here.

716
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,760
Um, wait, actually I'll read a quick chat comments here.

717
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,720
Sharon says Animal Crossing was only somewhat kid friendly.

718
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,920
It taught you to not take loans from anyone.

719
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,900
If you do, you'll have to do bitch work for your neighbors and take all the furniture

720
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,280
they throw away for the rest of your life.

721
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Nice.

722
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
Very nice.

723
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
All right.

724
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,280
Cool.

725
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
More news.

726
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Gotta.

727
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
Gotta.

728
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
Mm.

729
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Okay.

730
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Hey, guess what?

731
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Chicken butt.

732
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
There's.

733
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Guess why?

734
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Chicken thigh.

735
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Aha.

736
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
In your eye.

737
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,960
This is totally one of those shows now.

738
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,840
It's it's, you know what, having people in studio like a live audience practically ruins

739
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,840
this show.

740
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
But Rob.

741
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
What?

742
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,840
For my show, for my story, you need to do something.

743
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Okay.

744
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
What do I have to do for your story?

745
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,600
Go to the said site that this refers to from Squeenix.

746
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Okay.

747
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,280
And play the sound effect and see if anyone in the chat room gets it first.

748
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,080
I I have a feeling everybody in chat already knows what's coming and I I don't.

749
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
But I want the sound effect.

750
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
All right.

751
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
Yes, ma'am.

752
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,040
Orange Land's radio is fucked up in front of a live audience.

753
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
What a demanding woman tonight.

754
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
It has to be there.

755
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Let's see.

756
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
I've got to get there.

757
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,040
Here we go.

758
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
Oh, wait.

759
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
That's not it.

760
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
That's not me.

761
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,920
You're going to have to start reading the story.

762
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I can't find it.

763
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,920
Okay.

764
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,640
It's a game that I'm sure a lot of people have been wanting for quite a while.

765
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,680
And by the way, it's the link that says Japanese website, by the way.

766
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

767
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:00,680
Are they bringing back to to some sort of system there?

768
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Super Metroid?

769
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Because that game is awesome.

770
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
No.

771
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
Squeenix didn't make some Metroid.

772
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:11,360
They're bringing back an RPG that is speculated to be a port, hopefully remaining in 2D on

773
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,440
the Nintendo DS.

774
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Is it Infuriate or Super Metroid?

775
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Shut up.

776
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,600
I see what you did there.

777
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,920
It's not at all.

778
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
But do the viewers, do the listeners.

779
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm going to throw something at you, okay?

780
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Please do.

781
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:37,320
Anyway, um, Chrono Trigger, if you go to, um, Squeenix's site, the, um, address is square-annex.co.jp

782
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:47,120
slash, um, uh, C-T-D-S. And, um, as Rob is pulling it up now.

783
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,760
It's kind of slow because we're broadcasting.

784
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Yeah.

785
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,760
There you go.

786
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
There we go.

787
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,200
You want to hear the effect?

788
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,760
I don't even know if they're going to hear it.

789
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,600
We got so much shit running in the studio tonight.

790
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,480
At any rate, well, if you go to that site, you will see the clock.

791
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
And you will hear the ticking.

792
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,340
And you will know that it's Chrono Trigger.

793
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,440
Because no other game freaking has that clock making that same ticking noise at the very

794
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
start of it.

795
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
The clock stopped moving.

796
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,360
Yeah, my computer is not enjoying, uh, broadcasting an internet radio show and doing the Chrono

797
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
Trigger website at the same time.

798
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,320
So we will, we will let you do that for yourself so that you can have a truly interactive experience

799
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,120
those of you listening to the podcast.

800
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:29,000
Uh, AlphaKananagram says in chat, DarkSakura, now it's ChronoTrigger.jp as well.

801
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Is it?

802
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Rad.

803
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Uh, Shaoranz.

804
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Don't make it 3D, Squeenix.

805
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't fuck it up.

806
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,840
Shaoranz says, Chrono Trigger, it's over.

807
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,960
Seriously, guys, there are other RPGs that have better storylines and better character

808
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
development.

809
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
No!

810
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
No!

811
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Oh, snap.

812
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
No!

813
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Oh, snap.

814
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Object.

815
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
You did not, okay?

816
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
I think you did.

817
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,440
And, and they haven't translated the ones that do surpass it.

818
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,400
Here's the thing, I, I heard that the Chrono Trigger, oh, so what, Logie, what?

819
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Nothing.

820
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I'm, I'm good.

821
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,160
I just want to say about Chrono Trigger, it's not 3D.

822
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,080
Don't we already know it's going to be the same old sprites?

823
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
Yes, exactly.

824
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,360
We did nothing that we can tell, at least.

825
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,040
Bonus dungeon, Wi-Fi play.

826
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Something like that.

827
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,440
Maybe, maybe add, like, some bonus dungeons and, um, I heard co-op, but, you know, how

828
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
can you play co-op in that game?

829
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Because you have three people.

830
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
It would be, like, Secret of Mana.

831
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Uh.

832
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,080
That might be a little strange.

833
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
I don't know about that.

834
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,640
Well, Secret of Mana, you could have, um, three characters in Seiken, too, but the only

835
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,080
way that you could control all three of them was, uh, having a tap.

836
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
That was fun.

837
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
That was a lot of fun.

838
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
I've got a multi-tap, so that was a lot of fun.

839
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,280
Good times.

840
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,840
But, um, but the other speculation, and actually I hope that this will be included, is that

841
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,640
the, um, the animated scenes that they did for the PlayStation version, um, are, uh,

842
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,160
are rumored to be making it to the DS version, especially if they're spending less of the,

843
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,520
uh, processing power on the way the game runs and putting more of it into having the cinemas,

844
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,200
because that'll, that'll make it sweet.

845
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
More endings!

846
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
SSJ100madass, uh, co-op, gato battle.

847
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Ooh, sweet.

848
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,400
So, I wanna know, everyone who's in this room that's played Chrono Trigger, how many endings

849
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
have you gotten?

850
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
Two.

851
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,960
Hell, if I remember, probably four.

852
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,600
All of them.

853
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,280
You have no time on your hands, sir.

854
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,800
I mean, you have, uh, too much time.

855
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,680
What was the secret one where you go watch the, uh, she would open the thing with the

856
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,880
pendant and then you would go beat the game?

857
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,520
That was the very first one where you go in the teleporter and, um, right after you do

858
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,280
the teleport trick, and you can fight Lavas right from the start, but you have to, you

859
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,800
would, like, die instantly if you didn't do it in New Game Plus.

860
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,200
Oh, yeah.

861
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Hmm.

862
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
And I've done that one.

863
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,280
That's the one where you get the developers ending, where you actually have representations

864
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,560
of the developers and you go in, like, the last room and it's Toriyama wearing his, uh,

865
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
gas mask and everything.

866
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,560
And the credits go by really, really fast, because, you know, they want you to skip past

867
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,700
it again.

868
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,480
All this freaking reminiscing here in studio.

869
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,400
Loki looks like he's about to, uh, explode wanting to talk about Elibits.

870
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,800
No, I don't really care, right?

871
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
That's right.

872
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,280
I didn't play really much of Chrono Trigger and I don't, I don't feel bad for not having

873
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,560
played Chrono Trigger either, so.

874
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,040
If I want to play Chrono Trigger, I'll hook up my Super Nintendo and grab my cartridge.

875
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,400
I think the DS one might be kind of cool.

876
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I mean, it's...

877
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I've been playing Final Fantasy VI.

878
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
The scene is getting a Chrono Trigger Super Nintendo cartridge at this time.

879
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,240
If you didn't hang on to one, it's going to cost you a lot of money to get one now.

880
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Hey Rob!

881
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,880
This game is going to have the super secret final ending where you take the game back

882
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,320
to GameStop and trade it in for store credit.

883
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,760
Rob, please let go.

884
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,360
I didn't pay for my copy.

885
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,760
Someone gave it to me and he left.

886
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
So I have it in the box.

887
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Nice.

888
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Inherited.

889
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
I don't plan on paying for my copy either.

890
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
What a coincidence!

891
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
I know!

892
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Alright, move on.

893
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
More stories.

894
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,280
Okay, less exciting news.

895
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,080
Elibits 2 has been confirmed and, uh, it's not the same Elibits you may have remembered.

896
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,400
Now it's some sort of top-down, sprite-based game and there's lots of Elibits running around.

897
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,480
It's almost like a cartoony version of Pikmin or something like that.

898
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,880
I don't know.

899
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,440
But Elibits, the Adventures of Kayin Zeros coming out this fall...

900
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I don't know.

901
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,960
It looks weird.

902
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,920
Do you think maybe they're just like, you know, the Wii one just didn't work like we

903
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,640
wanted it to, so let's just jump ship and go to the DS, because we know it'll solve

904
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
more.

905
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,960
The 3D version on the DS and they're like, wow, that sucks, and then they're just like,

906
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,200
okay, let's see what we can do with the touchscreen and...

907
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
I don't know.

908
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,520
There's no way they could've done the 3D version on the DS anyways, because there's no depth

909
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
in it.

910
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
True.

911
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
True.

912
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,520
It'd be weird.

913
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,480
There's not a lot of depth in a lot of DS games, actually.

914
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,520
It looks like Pokemon.

915
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
It seriously looks like...

916
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,720
Well, Pokemon sells billions and billions of copies, so it probably is not a bad idea.

917
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
Yeah.

918
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,120
There you have it.

919
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,440
Coming to the Wii, however, even if Elibits 2 may not be coming to the Wii, apparently

920
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,900
Cooking Mama, there's going to be another Cooking Mama game on the Wii.

921
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,240
It's Cooking Mama World Kitchen, and it's coming to you from Majesco, and it's a follow-up

922
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:11,480
to the game Cooking Mama Cook-Off, which was kind of crap, because they tried to port a

923
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,000
DS game to the Wii, and it just didn't work very well, sadly.

924
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,800
Well, apparently Cooking Mama World Kitchen is a game that's actually being designed for

925
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,480
the Wii, and it's coming out for the holidays, and now instead of just the sprite graphics,

926
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,200
you're actually going to have polygon 3D-ish graphics, new minigames, new things to cook

927
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:34,360
up, and apparently, rhythm-based gameplay, so now Cooking Mama's going to be all rhythmic,

928
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,860
so that could be interesting.

929
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,000
This could either be really awesome or really crappy.

930
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm betting on the second.

931
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,800
I really hope not, because Cooking Mama's kind of cool.

932
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,800
I don't know.

933
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,780
Jamie, I know you love Cooking Mama very much.

934
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,960
What do you think about a rhythm-based Cooking Mama game on the Wii?

935
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,120
I'll reserve judgment until I actually try it, but that's how I say it.

936
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,120
I know.

937
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,600
It's the same way, but your heart doesn't, like, you know...

938
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,760
I'm completely apathetic towards it right now.

939
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Alright.

940
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
I will play it.

941
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,280
I'm interested, but I'm not going to make my judgment until I actually see it, because

942
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,760
honestly, I've had games where I've made a harsh judgment about them to start, and it's

943
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,520
turned out that they've been pretty fun, so I'm not going to...

944
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Like Imagine Babies?

945
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Hell no!

946
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
That game sucks!

947
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,600
That game is like the, it's like the bugs that live in shit.

948
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,080
Let's see, where did we have in the chat room?

949
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,000
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

950
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
That might be a Cooking Mama.

951
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We're listening to that this weekend.

952
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's the words out of my mouth.

953
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,680
Frisbee says, Cooking Mama Hell's Kitchen.

954
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,040
Now that might be a little bit fun if somebody screams at Cooking Mama and makes her cry.

955
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,480
Except if they base it off of a show, it should be based off of a good show.

956
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,120
Well, Hell's Kitchen is already getting a DS game, and it's actually coming out before

957
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,880
Cooking Mama, so...

958
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Interesting.

959
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,760
I don't know if that's going to be any good, though.

960
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,000
Alright, well there you have it.

961
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
So we'll see about that Cooking Mama game.

962
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,240
I don't know, I have to admit, it makes me a little bit nervous, but we'll see.

963
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,840
We shall.

964
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:16,460
Well, for more happy wee news, this might make some people very pleased, but there is

965
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:22,480
a, uh, a little bit more coming out on the, uh, for WiiWare.

966
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,160
It was actually released on Friday.

967
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,560
It's um...

968
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,160
First is Pokemon Ranch, where, to quote, it's a place where Pokemon and people love living

969
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,160
together.

970
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Bleh.

971
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
Yeah.

972
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,160
Anyway.

973
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,360
You don't think they need Pokemon Bunny Ranch?

974
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
No.

975
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Or Pokemon Sniper.

976
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,960
It's Jigglypimp's Whore Lounge from Kalec in the House.

977
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
Slut Bunny.

978
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
No, I already showed you.

979
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,760
You need to watch that, okay?

980
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Anyway.

981
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I did.

982
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
It's a Pokemon parody, it's funny.

983
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
Yes.

984
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Anyway.

985
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,640
Um, it's supposed to be sort of like a cross between Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon,

986
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,080
to where you will bring in your Pokemon from Diamond and Pearl, and you can play with them

987
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:12,360
and take pictures, and um, and you can do stuff.

988
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,560
You just can't level with them.

989
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,860
Shauran in chat wants to know if you can brand them.

990
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,360
That would be awesome.

991
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Yeee-hoo!

992
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
Pika!

993
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,840
Uh, Pokemon Snap 2.

994
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,360
This time, you have a gun.

995
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,360
Kinky.

996
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,360
Pokemon Sniper.

997
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
A whole new kind of rail shooter.

998
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,360
Pokemon Snap-ther next.

999
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Aww.

1000
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,600
Cheeseburger says, Imagine Sniper.

1001
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Chat downwards on Twitter.

1002
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
I would play Imagine Sniper.

1003
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
That'd be like Silent Scope, though.

1004
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:50,600
And, um, but it's going to be a thousand Wii points, and the other one is a game that you

1005
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,760
pop bubbles on.

1006
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,800
The bubble-popping game is finally coming out.

1007
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
It's called Pop.

1008
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,240
What a clever title.

1009
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
You just pop bubbles.

1010
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Can you pop Pokemon?

1011
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Is it like Buster Brothers?

1012
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,600
No, I think it's supposed to be more like, um, there's, it's a bubble-wraps, like, online

1013
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
game.

1014
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,080
I played with that the other day!

1015
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
It was called Bubble-Wrap!

1016
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,200
Let me, it was called Going to Seize Candy, and the best part is the Bubble-Wrap.

1017
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1018
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
What?

1019
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
It was called I Bought a Teapot and Played the Bubble-Wrap.

1020
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Here's my question.

1021
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,200
If you feed a Pokemon an Alka-Seltzer, will it explode?

1022
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
That's what I want to know.

1023
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
No.

1024
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
No?

1025
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Only, only the avian ones will.

1026
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,560
Well, that's some of them.

1027
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
There's birds.

1028
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,040
Pikachu giblets everywhere.

1029
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,920
Rice Princess has this horrified look on her face.

1030
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Are you, are you okay?

1031
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Would you play Pokemon Ranch?

1032
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Does it sound like a fun game to you?

1033
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
No.

1034
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Alright.

1035
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
Wait.

1036
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Wait.

1037
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
What?

1038
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
It's 700 Wii points.

1039
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
We'll see.

1040
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
To pop bubbles.

1041
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
This is awesome, though.

1042
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,960
Nintendo and WiiWare, they're really doing, like, some different things.

1043
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,640
You know, well, people want, like, a new Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles game.

1044
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,400
You get Crystal Chronicles, you know, My Life as the King.

1045
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,080
It's not really a Crystal Chronicles game, it's more of, like, other people are having

1046
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,320
fun outside of your city and you're just staying home watching TV, and that's kind of what

1047
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
it is.

1048
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,600
So, Pokemon, you know, Ranch, oh, well, yo, we could put out a Pokemon game on WiiWare,

1049
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,960
but no, let's make a game where you take Pokemon from other games that you have to purchase,

1050
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,160
or you can just sit there and wait days and days and days for a new Pokemon to come to

1051
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,040
your ranch and walk around and do nothing, except take pictures with them.

1052
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:30,360
I, I feel an OLR game somewhere in here called, like, God Damn I'm So Bored.

1053
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,760
We play it every Sunday.

1054
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,080
No, Rob, that's like, that's like, that's like the online, that's like the Mii parade.

1055
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,920
And God Damn I'm So Bored, you start a podcast with your two friends, and then you just sit

1056
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,520
there and pop bubble wrap the whole time.

1057
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,320
I don't know, there's a game to be made here somewhere, I gotta think about it.

1058
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:52,240
You also have to include, um, turning on your Wii for the first time and trying to watch

1059
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,720
Mii March with only one Mii on it.

1060
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
That's God Damn I'm So Lonely.

1061
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
I, I, I, I had that moment in my first month of Wii.

1062
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,320
No, no, no, because you eventually get more Mii as you open yourself up to the internet,

1063
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,080
but I remember when we first got our Wii, we just turned it on, and Dan and I were watching

1064
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,800
this blank screen going, where are they?

1065
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I want to see the parade!

1066
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,360
No, seriously, all the games on WiiWare seem to be very limited and stupid like this.

1067
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:18,320
I mean, there's, um, the Star Soldier game that has two levels, awesome!

1068
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
And then there's, like, um, what else do they have?

1069
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,180
Well, they have Dr. Mario, but that's just, you know, Dr. Mario.

1070
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,120
And, um, they've got this other game that's another DS port of a game that's a ripoff

1071
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
of Zuma.

1072
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,120
And...

1073
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,120
Magnetica.

1074
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
Magnetica.

1075
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Totally different.

1076
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
A better name.

1077
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
A better name.

1078
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
Well, it's not all...

1079
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:42,120
Because Magnetica sounds like a Mega Man boss or something.

1080
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
Magnetica.

1081
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,120
Maybe not.

1082
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:50,520
Um, and then they have, what is it, Toki Tori, which, that game's just lame, and, um,

1083
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,080
the Bubble Popping game, which, I don't know, it's all kind of lame.

1084
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,480
Alright, well.

1085
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Oh well.

1086
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,080
Um, something else that hopefully is not lame.

1087
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:07,120
Castlevania Judgment, the kind of, not really a Castlevania game, but now it's, uh, Soul

1088
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
Castlevania.

1089
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,560
You know, Soul Calibur, but Castlevania characters and that kind of thing.

1090
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,400
Um, it will have Wii DS connectivity.

1091
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:26,080
You'll be able to plug in your new order of S, what was it, uh, Ecclesia, the new DS platformer

1092
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,480
game coming out, to unlock bonus gameplay content.

1093
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,720
And also so Konami can say, we sold you one of each.

1094
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
Sucker.

1095
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,080
Let me guess, let me guess, I'm thinking a character that you only see in the DS game

1096
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,480
is going to be playable in the Wii game if you connect them.

1097
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
What do you think?

1098
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
What do you think?

1099
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
And, yeah.

1100
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
What do you think?

1101
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
And guess what?

1102
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,760
It's probably paid to unlock content because you're paying for the DS game to unlock the

1103
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,160
content on the DS that was already there.

1104
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Yeah.

1105
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Wouldn't surprise me at all.

1106
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Wouldn't surprise me at all.

1107
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,800
But here's what you need to do.

1108
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,480
You get a friend that has this game for the DS and you just have them come over and done.

1109
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
No purchase necessary.

1110
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
There you go.

1111
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,480
All right.

1112
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,800
Well, Loki was talking about this a little bit earlier during his gaming week, but if

1113
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,320
you haven't heard yet, there's a homebrew Super Smash Brothers Rumble that's available

1114
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,400
on the DS.

1115
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,820
It's by a homebrew programmer that goes by the name of Fuzzy.

1116
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,560
If you touch him, do you get dizzy?

1117
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,960
That's what I want to know.

1118
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Bad joke there.

1119
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,480
Now, apparently though, the game only has three levels in it right now and just one

1120
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,240
character is playable in the game.

1121
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
It's Mario.

1122
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,640
Now, I have not actually played the game.

1123
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,600
There's YouTubage of it, but Loki, since you've actually played the game, tell us a little

1124
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,920
more about it.

1125
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,920
It's very simplified.

1126
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,800
I mean, it's sprite-based characters.

1127
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,760
Is it Smash Brothers or is it like Mario?

1128
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,680
It's supposed to be like Smash Brothers.

1129
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Okay.

1130
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Okay.

1131
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,160
But, you know, the only playable character is Mario right now and the computer player

1132
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,160
doesn't really do anything.

1133
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,720
He just kind of runs around trying to avoid you and you can't really smash him off the

1134
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,200
edge, you know, defeating the purpose of Smash Brothers.

1135
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,560
Personally, I think they should just port over Mugen, but, you know, that's just...

1136
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,040
It's asking a bit much.

1137
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,720
Well, I don't know if he would be able to run it either.

1138
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,960
All right.

1139
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,000
Well, if you are homebrew enabled on your DS, which I'm actually kind of curious.

1140
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,160
I'm going to ask the chat room a question.

1141
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,800
How many people are actually homebrew enabled on their DS?

1142
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,200
We have how many people in chat right now?

1143
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,560
Almost 50 people in chat right now.

1144
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,920
I want to know how many of you are homebrew enabled in chat right now.

1145
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,440
Say something while we go over some release dates.

1146
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,640
We'll start with the UK.

1147
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,760
Well, coming out in the UK, we have a number of things all on the 11th.

1148
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:41,080
We have Beijing 2008, the official video game of the Olympic Games.

1149
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,480
That's on PC.

1150
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,080
Devil May Cry 4 on PC.

1151
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,960
Doodle Hex on DS.

1152
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,080
Secret Agent Clank on PSP.

1153
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,120
Sports Party on Wii.

1154
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,560
Summer Athletics on PS2, PC, and Xbox 360.

1155
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,400
And The Incredible Hulk on PS2.

1156
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,560
Sounds like a busy week.

1157
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,880
In the US, it's not that busy of a week, but there's still some stuff coming out.

1158
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,980
Civilization Revolution coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and the DS.

1159
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,840
Also this week, Unreal Tournament 3 for the Xbox 360.

1160
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,200
We've got...

1161
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Let's see here.

1162
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,520
Lots of people looking forward to that one on 360.

1163
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Yes.

1164
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:35,600
Final Fantasy Fables, Chocobo Dungeon on the Wii, which I suppose, I guess it's not quite

1165
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,480
a port of the DS game.

1166
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,760
Carnival Games on the DS.

1167
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,120
And Wonder World Amusement Park on the Wii.

1168
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,920
Wait, is the Carnival Games on the DS the other way around where they ported a Wii game

1169
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,920
to the DS?

1170
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,920
Yes.

1171
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,920
That's interesting.

1172
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
Yeah.

1173
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,760
Beijing Olympics 2008 on the PS3 and Xbox 360.

1174
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,800
Devil May Cry 4 on the PC.

1175
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,600
Per Pals for the Wii.

1176
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,360
Code Lyoko Quest for Infinity on the PSP.

1177
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,680
And let's see.

1178
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,440
And I believe that's pretty much it for the week.

1179
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,600
Stigax 282 says, Civ Rev for the fucking win, I agree, that's the game I'm definitely looking

1180
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,660
forward to because I actually really like the demo and I don't think it's going to crap

1181
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,440
on my childhood memories of the original Civilization, which I was a little worried about at first,

1182
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,760
so I'm pretty excited about that.

1183
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,940
GameGuru agrees, Civ Rev for the win.

1184
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:33,920
And RobW2B says, Carnival Games is a different game.

1185
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,160
It's not the same thing.

1186
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,360
By the way, let's go back real quick before I do Japanese dates and see how many of our

1187
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,520
chat rooms are currently homebrew enabled.

1188
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,040
Let's see, where were we?

1189
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,040
Where do we start in chat?

1190
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,040
N, I don't.

1191
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,480
Me, I don't even have a DS.

1192
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,440
If I knew how to do it, I am, Skye.

1193
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,680
I am homebrew enabled.

1194
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,520
Raise his hand, can play homebrew, nope.

1195
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,800
I am homebrew enabled.

1196
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,800
Yep.

1197
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,960
DS, what's that?

1198
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,120
I have not turned on my DS in like a year.

1199
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,000
I'm not, but my friends is.

1200
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yes.

1201
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,720
No homebrew on my DS.

1202
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,400
I am homebrew enabled for DS, Wii, PSP.

1203
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,800
I don't even have a DS.

1204
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,660
And lastly, my GBA, DS, PSP, and iPod are all running homebrew apps.

1205
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,880
That's actually a larger percentage than I would have thought.

1206
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,840
Because I don't run homebrew on my DS because I just don't know how to do it.

1207
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,040
And Mokey's like, hey, you want a hit?

1208
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,000
Well, once you get the device to do it, it's really simple.

1209
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,880
I mean, it's just drag drop, you know, no thought.

1210
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
Interesting.

1211
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,280
It's not like, you know, a Wii or some installations required and that kind of thing.

1212
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,720
Alright, well let's go over to Japan and look at some release dates coming out over there.

1213
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,360
On the Xbox 360, some games are getting a price reduction.

1214
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:50,760
Viva Piñata on the Xbox 360 is getting cut in price, as well as Forza Motorsport 2 and

1215
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,640
Test Drive Unlimited, as well as The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.

1216
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,560
They all move into the Platinum Collection in Japan this week.

1217
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,960
As far as new games go, Kane & Lynch Deadman comes out on the Xbox 360 in Japan.

1218
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,220
That's a new one.

1219
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:08,120
Coming out on the PlayStation 3 in Japan on July 10th, Dark Sector as well as Kane & Lynch

1220
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,200
Deadman comes out on the PlayStation 3.

1221
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,640
Moving on over to the Nintendo Wii, checking out what's over there.

1222
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,160
Not a lot.

1223
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,800
Biohazard Zero, which of course is Resident Evil outside of the US.

1224
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,800
Biohazard Zero comes out as well on July the 10th.

1225
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,240
Going over to the handhelds in Japan, I'm sorry, first PlayStation 2, again, a couple

1226
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,680
games go into the best series, but here's one a lot of people are looking forward to.

1227
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,420
Persona 4 comes out in Japan on July 10th.

1228
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,640
And if you're a hardcore RPG fan and you can read Japanese and understand it, you are probably

1229
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,480
importing this game, I would imagine.

1230
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,360
Just call it a hunch.

1231
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,840
But I know people are crazy about Persona 4.

1232
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,720
On the Nintendo DS, Custom Beat Battle Draglade 2 comes out.

1233
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:58,380
Cosmetic Paradise, Maki no Kiseki comes out.

1234
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,360
What else do we have here?

1235
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,640
Another couple games go into price reduction, so lots of sales this week.

1236
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,280
Pet Shop, Monogatari DS comes out from Taito.

1237
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,720
On the Sony PSP, I doubt there's a lot this week.

1238
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,720
Taking a look.

1239
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,720
Oh, God of War Chains of Olympus, I take that back.

1240
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,840
God of War Chains of Olympus gets its Japanese version this week.

1241
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
So check that out.

1242
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,880
I thought I read that last week on the show, so I must have been looking in advance or

1243
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
something.

1244
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,720
Also, a Vehicle Battle game comes out on the PSP from Irem.

1245
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,160
Pongkotsu Roman Daika Sugeki Bumpy Trot.

1246
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,920
It's um, God what the hell do they call it, Steam Bot Chronicles.

1247
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,880
I like that other name though, that's cute.

1248
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,880
Bumpy Trot.

1249
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,880
Bumpy Trot.

1250
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,160
See, I'd buy it here if it was called Bumpy Trot, but no, I just gotta have a lame name.

1251
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,840
I have a bunch of these little harmonicas for that game at work.

1252
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
I don't know why.

1253
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,840
What?

1254
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,920
It was some crap that they sent us to promote the game.

1255
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,040
Unfortunately they sent it like a year after it came out, and I was like, okay, I can't

1256
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,000
do anything with this.

1257
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,360
Random question from chat that has nothing to do with anything we're talking about.

1258
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,640
Fear the Claw asks, well sort of, because we mention it during release dates.

1259
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,760
Fear the Claw asks, I've never played Viva Pinata, what is it?

1260
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Is it really that bad?

1261
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,040
Uh, gosh, where do we begin?

1262
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,640
Viva Pinata was Xbox 360's kind of foray to try and rip off Pokemon in a way.

1263
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,640
Not necessarily rip off.

1264
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,160
They went in it full board, they actually did a TV show.

1265
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,160
TV show, everything.

1266
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,200
You know, the problem was, the game was too complicated for seven year olds to understand.

1267
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,680
And then the teenagers and adults that wanted to play it, it was a little bit too much of

1268
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,840
a kid game.

1269
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,520
So the original's not bad, it's not a bad game by any means, especially considering

1270
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,000
how cheap we can find it now, but the sequel, Viva Pinata Party Animals, that's bad.

1271
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,400
Because that wasn't even the same type of game.

1272
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,160
But then there's gonna be another sequel that's gonna be Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise,

1273
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,400
which is coming out in September on the 360, so if you really want to check that out, maybe

1274
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,880
wait until that comes out.

1275
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,840
And then there's also Viva Pinata Park to Paradise, which is coming out in the DS in

1276
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,840
September as well, I think.

1277
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,840
All right.

1278
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,600
Well, let's get back to some gaming news.

1279
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,120
Now you know release dates are out of the blood.

1280
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:17,040
Well, in other news, and this actually specifically goes for folks in Chandler, Arizona, at the

1281
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,960
McCullough Price House, there's a, I don't know if this is still going on, but it was

1282
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,520
going on as of the first, but an exhibit that's ancient history of video games, specifically

1283
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,720
on 70s consoles, and they are all set up to wear, first of all, for games that didn't

1284
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:40,080
require electricity, like Lincoln Logs.

1285
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,520
That's not a game.

1286
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:48,120
I'm going through everything, but it's also got freestanding games like Centipede and

1287
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,980
Space Invaders, and home consoles with, actually even there was one table that said set up

1288
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:00,200
like a 1970s living room with a sofa facing a large wooden TV set.

1289
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:12,240
And it had an Atari console plugged in with cartridges and everything, Telstar, and as

1290
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:19,520
it started there, it actually moved on through towards more modern era systems too.

1291
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,560
Just I guess to show how video gaming has evolved.

1292
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:29,680
And then they were having a lot of people bring in their private collections to loan

1293
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,600
some of their systems in for the project, and basically sort of like how our classic

1294
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,800
gaming expo was, if you remember.

1295
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,760
I was going to say, it sounds like the museum, the classic gaming expo.

1296
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:47,000
That's exactly what I think it was like, but it even had a full 80s era arcade that had

1297
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,600
a bunch of games and exhibits set up, and they were all in free play.

1298
00:51:52,600 --> 00:52:00,560
And if anyone, if it's still going on though, if anyone lives in or near Chandler, Arizona,

1299
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,520
we would definitely appreciate if you would actually go get us some pictures from this.

1300
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,520
Awesome.

1301
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
We like pictures.

1302
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
Yes.

1303
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,520
I'd appreciate if you stole something from me.

1304
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
Remember, remember.

1305
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,120
But we didn't tell you to do it.

1306
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:20,440
Remember, if you value your soul, don't bother playing the Fairchild Channel F. It sucks.

1307
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,720
So noted.

1308
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,720
So noted.

1309
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,520
Duly noted.

1310
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,240
There's a game that's, I guess, coming out in Europe that's kind of interesting, and

1311
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,480
unfortunately this is a rather old article, but I thought it was interesting anyways.

1312
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,880
Music Monsters.

1313
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:44,500
It's a new music game being developed by publisher Joe Wood, and it combines kind of like, Owen

1314
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,380
Dunn with Jam Sessions and Band Brothers.

1315
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:49,380
And it's kind of neat.

1316
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,380
You have like...

1317
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,380
That could be neat.

1318
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,360
Basically, the gameplay is just like Owen Dunn.

1319
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,600
There's little circles that you see that appear you have to tap with your stylus.

1320
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:01,760
But as stuff goes along, it's kind of walking you through playing music on like, they have

1321
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,080
a harpsichord, and then it goes to this weird tripped out guitar thing.

1322
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,440
And as you're playing the game, it's kind of like BeatMania a little bit almost too,

1323
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:15,320
where you'll play the guitar part, then you'll play a keyboard part, etc.

1324
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,640
But they have stuff in there.

1325
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:25,280
There was, I believe there was a Depeche Mode song in there, the ones I saw in there, also

1326
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:32,120
other than that, Final Countdown, and there was the, was it Numa Numa, or something like

1327
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,120
that?

1328
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,120
Oh god.

1329
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,800
Is that the song that the fat kid dances to in that YouTube video?

1330
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,320
I think so, yes.

1331
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:45,760
Those were, yeah, in there as well, so no word on when that's coming out though yet,

1332
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,920
but soon, hopefully soon, maybe the Halloween time or something like that.

1333
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,920
Maybe more at E3?

1334
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
Who knows?

1335
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:53,920
Maybe.

1336
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:54,920
Maybe.

1337
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,720
Alright, well, probably the worst kept secret in the gaming industry, speaking of E3, was

1338
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,320
that, hey, there's a Rock Band 2 coming!

1339
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,680
So it was finally made official this week, Rock Band 2 is coming, and IGN ran this big

1340
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,100
article about the whole thing, they had an interview with the lead designer of Dan Teasdale,

1341
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,800
and this is the cool thing about Rock Band 2, anything that you downloaded in Rock Band

1342
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,920
1, the download content, you are going to be automatically able to use in Rock Band

1343
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
2.

1344
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
Nice.

1345
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,920
Very nice.

1346
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,320
And hopefully it's not one of those cases where it's all already on the disc, kind of

1347
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,320
like they did with the DDR games.

1348
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,320
I don't think so.

1349
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
But I don't think so, there's too much of it.

1350
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,120
No, I think they just made it compatible with the songs that you download, because each

1351
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,520
song that you download is like, you know, 60, you know, 30 to 60 megs, so.

1352
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,080
I think it's great.

1353
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,080
So there you have it.

1354
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,920
And by the way, also a quote from Teasdale, we've also secured what I can easily say is

1355
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,680
the best setlist I've ever seen in a music game.

1356
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,440
Oh really, sir?

1357
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,560
Well some of that best setlist apparently leaked out this week in a YG4 TV, oh, gotta

1358
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,560
love them.

1359
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,680
Except not.

1360
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,080
In their show X-Play, they were showing a little clip of Rock Band 2 the day it was

1361
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,880
announced, and here's the thing, if you know how to pause your screen at just the right

1362
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,440
moment, guess what?

1363
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,560
You can see part of the song list, and it includes, let's see, Dream Theater, System

1364
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:13,360
of a Down, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Fru Fighters, Kim Wilde, Kids in America, that was a DDR

1365
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:21,600
game, Motorhead, Cheap Trick, Journey, thank you very much, Win, The Who, Pinball Wizard,

1366
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,080
which, there you have it.

1367
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,140
Everlong, fuck yes.

1368
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,920
That sounds pretty awesome.

1369
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,880
And then even more Rock Band 2 songs apparently came out.

1370
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,600
This one, I mean, it's one thing to have the freeze frame on G4 TV, that's pretty obvious,

1371
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,360
but apparently now also a user at the forums at Score Hero apparently has spent some time

1372
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,800
with Rock Band 2.

1373
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,520
This one, slightly bigger grain of salt, but this, I don't see why any of this wouldn't

1374
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,600
be real.

1375
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:53,080
Linkin Park, Mega Death, Rage Against the Machine, The Guess Who, Lenny Kravitz, it

1376
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,000
could be either one, because this American Woman is the song, Billy Idol, White Wedding,

1377
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,600
that is badass, Alanis Morissette, You Oughta Know, I never thought I'd see that in a music

1378
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,400
game, that's gonna be awesome, that's my favorite, I never thought I'd see her in a video game,

1379
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,720
Jethro Tull, it could, Aqualung.

1380
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:16,960
Either the Thin Lizzy or Joan Jett version of Bad Reputation, Alice in Chains, get this,

1381
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,920
evening is better, this is where I start to go, this is too good, Soundgarden with Spoonman,

1382
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,120
and get this, Jamie, this is the best ever.

1383
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,880
Not quite, because you can use your Radiohead download content at least.

1384
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,480
The Go-Go's, we got the beat.

1385
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,760
I think I'm gonna take the Alice in Chains with the big grain of salt because the song

1386
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,880
featured is Man in the Box, I don't know how they would censor that.

1387
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,720
Well they censor it in the regular game, you never know.

1388
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,000
Well it doesn't matter, Journey is there, that's an automatic win.

1389
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Automatic win?

1390
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,080
I mean, Say No More?

1391
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,680
I think Jethro Tull was there, automatic win.

1392
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,520
Proof that flutes do belong in a rock band.

1393
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,920
Jethro Tull for the win, hi.

1394
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,480
And Hit Stun in Chat says, actually yeah, I'd play that Alanis Morissette guitar part,

1395
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,880
that was like her most rockin' song, that would be great for a rock band.

1396
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,160
And Dreadlock Lord says, are these rock bands?

1397
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Yes.

1398
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,160
Some greats in there.

1399
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,720
I just can't believe that she wrote that song about Dave Coulier.

1400
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,360
SSJ100Matt says, Rob, what about Like a Prayer?

1401
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,920
God, I hope not.

1402
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,560
No, there's any God in Heaven, no.

1403
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,560
I've never in my life gotten over that.

1404
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,200
I didn't even know behind the music, I discovered it.

1405
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,200
Did you see the other ones?

1406
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,240
You're all welcome to go Dying of Fire, what's that?

1407
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,600
The other rumored track lists or whatever.

1408
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:35,040
So we've gone from little grain of salt to medium sized grain of salt to now big grain

1409
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,040
of salt.

1410
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,920
This is big grain of salt.

1411
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:44,560
There was some leaked track lists, first one I guess is from some guy named Demp, a commenter

1412
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:53,240
on 8BitFix, and he says he's got, I guess someone that saw it via an email source or

1413
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,240
something like that.

1414
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,120
Anyways, it's like a fourth hand hearsay they said.

1415
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:05,840
Here are some of the tracks, ACDC, Let There Be Rock, AFI, Lance Morissette, which you

1416
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,920
ought to know on there, Alice in Chains, let's just read the important ones.

1417
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:19,720
Beastie Boys, Beck, Blondie, Devo, The Donnas, Duran Duran, Fleetwood Mac, this is too good

1418
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,720
to be true.

1419
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:26,320
If that is the real list, win for Rock Band, game set match.

1420
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,000
Oh my god, lit with her one hit wonder of my own worst enemy.

1421
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Okay, big grain of salt.

1422
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,880
Survivor, Eye of the Tiger, no this is too good.

1423
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,480
Let's see here, and then they had another one here, Loading Realities, another one,

1424
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,800
they had some other songs.

1425
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:55,920
Presidents of the USA with Lump, Bon Jovi, no this is a fanboy list, it's got to be.

1426
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,640
If it's the real one, I am so sold.

1427
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:04,560
That's gonna be good, and you know what, I bet you it's only a few more weeks away, E3,

1428
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,640
they're gonna announce some stuff about it, there was also some rumors that there's gonna

1429
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,580
be some additional hardware, optional hardware stuff for you, I don't know if like Effector

1430
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,800
Pedals or something like that, that's gonna be involved, but you know.

1431
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,840
But sadly, neither Loki nor Dark Sakura will be doing any singing in Rock Band, will they?

1432
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
Sadness.

1433
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
No I won't.

1434
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
Ooh, yay.

1435
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,840
Don't get me drunk, I will.

1436
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,200
Alright, sounds like a plan.

1437
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,840
Real quickly before we move on, in Rock Band 1 news, or will be Rock Band 2, because it's

1438
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,500
download stuff, some new stuff coming out for the Rock Band download content, some Red

1439
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:40,960
Hot Chili Peppers songs, Tell Me Baby and Snow, Hey Oh, and Rush, Closer to the Heart

1440
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,200
and Working Man, that's pretty awesome.

1441
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,520
Also The Who, they were gonna try to get the entire album Who's Next, but unfortunately

1442
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,360
the master recordings weren't all available, so you get something even better, it's a best

1443
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,080
of The Who, and it's a ton of freakin' songs, Amazing Journey, Baba O'Reilly, Behind Blue

1444
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:01,200
Eyes, Eminence Front, Going Mobile, Leaving Here, Real Good Lookin' Boy, Seein' Sand,

1445
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,680
Who Are You, and live versions of my generation, Summertime Blues and Young Man Blues.

1446
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,640
So for Who fans, you're ready to go with that, that's great.

1447
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,960
I gotta ask, where the fuck is the Nirvana we were promised?

1448
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,960
Who cares?

1449
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,280
No, no, forget the Nirvana.

1450
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,280
Where's the weird Al?

1451
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,520
He has original stuff, come on now, where's some weird Al?

1452
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,580
Something big at E3, you can betcha, something big at E3, whether it's Weird Al or Nirvana,

1453
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,580
we shall see.

1454
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,260
So, but you have more rock band news, right?

1455
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:34,360
That I do, Mr. Rob, as in, we played a bunch of it at my house, no I'm kidding.

1456
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:41,620
There's actually a number of bands that are in talks to do different music games, Frontline

1457
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:48,200
Music Label, of course there's Aerosmith, some of the other groups in talks are Guns

1458
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:55,120
and Roses and Van Halen, who were wanted to put out music games, and there's also the

1459
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:03,800
Eagles and Steely Dan have agreements in the works, so we might be seeing quite a number

1460
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:13,920
of other really big names, but there's actually one group that's never gonna do it, and that's

1461
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:20,400
Led Zeppelin, because they don't want anyone to touch the master recordings.

1462
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,560
I think they're just being bitches about it, how about you?

1463
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
They're bitches.

1464
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
Too much hot.

1465
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,360
I don't know.

1466
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:36,920
Well, let's see here, in other news, completely unrelated to rock band, Firmware 2.40 for

1467
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:43,600
the Playstation 3 was released last week, and immediately pulled back down because there

1468
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,600
were some issues with it, but 2.40 of course, as you may remember, was the one introducing

1469
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:57,200
the brand new trophy system, as well as in-game cross-media bar, and custom soundtracks and

1470
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:06,280
all that fun stuff, oh well, but there's obviously a problem and they're working on fixing it,

1471
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,680
and hopefully it'll be up again soon, but there was some other stuff I heard about that

1472
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,880
was kind of interesting though, they're gonna do, well they have some updates already for

1473
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:23,400
some of the older games that have come out to add trophies to them, which is pretty cool.

1474
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,800
I don't know, I think right now these trophies don't really mean much to me until I think

1475
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,120
Home comes out and you can actually display them.

1476
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,880
It's like, oh, hey guys, we fucked it up, let's try again.

1477
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,640
Yeah, I saw Scott Reuben was having some issues with 2.40.

1478
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:45,120
And we had in chat, Rob 2B says, thank god I waited to download it, and Zappi says, it's

1479
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,560
fine, I've used it since Wednesday, so it sounds like the problem's sporadic.

1480
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,360
I wonder if it's a certain model of PS3s that's having the issues, because you know they've

1481
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,360
had different types.

1482
01:02:52,360 --> 01:03:00,760
They've had the ones that can play PS2 games, the ones that can play, so, hmm, alright,

1483
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,240
so did you check out the firmware yourself, Loki?

1484
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,240
I'm sorry, I skipped out for a minute, nope.

1485
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,240
Not having it?

1486
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,240
No.

1487
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:14,880
I don't really care, because I haven't played a game on my PS3 for a long time.

1488
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,680
I don't think my PS3's been on in like three weeks.

1489
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,680
I use it for movies.

1490
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,120
But the next game that we're getting is the initial T-Came anyway.

1491
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,120
Nice.

1492
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,640
By the way, the trophies that are gonna be the big part of 2.40 whenever they get the

1493
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:33,660
working version out, apparently there was an earlier statement that every game would

1494
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:39,160
actually have trophies in it, but that probably only meant the actual first-party games, because

1495
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,080
you know what, the third-party publishers, some of them say they're not gonna go back

1496
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,760
and put trophies in the games, because they've moved on to bigger and better things.

1497
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,520
For instance, Insomniac, one of the bigger developers, they are focusing on Resistance

1498
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,800
2, which I guess that would actually be a first-party, because Insomniac developed the

1499
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,040
game for Sony, huh?

1500
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:00,120
They are focusing on Resistance 2, they are not gonna be putting trophies in Resistance

1501
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,520
or Ratchet and Clank Future.

1502
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,680
They may, well, it's just not their biggest priority right now.

1503
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,440
I mean, big deal.

1504
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Get over it.

1505
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,880
SSJ100Matt says, the trophies are a lie.

1506
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,120
Indeed.

1507
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:18,240
And by the way, also adding to the list, Call of Duty 4, Civilization Revolution, not right

1508
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,560
now for trophies.

1509
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,760
Maybe in the future.

1510
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,720
Unless they're yanking our chain, which is possible, who knows, but I somehow doubt it.

1511
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,600
What do you guys, out of curiosity, you guys here in studio, what do you think about trophies?

1512
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,440
Is it something needed, or is it just, like, whatever, or what?

1513
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,800
It's kinda neat, but I haven't even really figured out what all that means, like, you

1514
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,000
know, I know there's different trophies you can get.

1515
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,400
There are different, like, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.

1516
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,680
I don't know what any of it means yet, because I haven't played a game that uses them, so.

1517
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,680
I don't know.

1518
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,720
It's just, it's neat, but it's not gonna, like, I think with the 360, I'm more inclined

1519
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,320
to buy games and stuff, because it's like, ooh, I got all these achievements and stuff

1520
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,320
like that.

1521
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:03,240
Or at least to play them to their, you know, end.

1522
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:09,040
But with the Playstation 3, I'm not really interested in it, I mean, as far as buying

1523
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:12,120
games to, you know, play them for their trophies.

1524
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,840
Maybe when home comes out, who knows.

1525
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:17,080
Well, you know, Resistance 2 I'm definitely gonna buy, but.

1526
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,560
Xenocore has a good point in chat.

1527
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:22,260
Ratchet and Clank has its own trophy system, don't need the ones on the PS3.

1528
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,180
Game Guru says, trophies, like achievements, are meh.

1529
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,600
And Tigerclaw says, geez, just when we have to deal with achievement whores, now we gotta

1530
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,160
deal with trophy whores.

1531
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,840
Wait until those houses open up in home.

1532
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,840
That's when you're gonna see the trophy whores.

1533
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,800
My Billy has gotten all these trophies.

1534
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,720
That's when you're gonna see the trophy whores.

1535
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,360
Yeah, but she's still got no life, huh?

1536
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,360
Alright.

1537
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,880
Sadly, though, we can't go back and add trophies to some of the classic games from the past,

1538
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,920
but you know what, they're better off without them.

1539
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,840
But we always like to take a moment here at the end of part A on every episode of Orange

1540
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:55,180
Laundry and pay some tribute to the old classics, and that's what we're gonna do this week's

1541
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:57,000
classic game of the week.

1542
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Dark Sakura, gonna go to her gaming wardrobe, dig out an old, dusty cartridge and say, hey,

1543
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
play this damn game this week.

1544
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
What game is it this week, Dark Sakura?

1545
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
This is actually a game that I think I might own, but I haven't played it in a long, long,

1546
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,000
long, long, long time.

1547
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,720
But it's for Osprey, who's not in the chat room.

1548
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,360
Fifty points.

1549
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:21,520
It's Ristar, which is a platform game that was done by Sonic Team.

1550
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:28,400
And if you play it, you will notice quite a number of similarities to the Sonic games.

1551
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,960
Quite a number of them.

1552
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:39,000
But it is, it's this little star who runs around, and he, you know, can move across

1553
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:45,680
bars and things, you know, like monkey bar type hanging bars, and jump over things and

1554
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,280
shoot things, well, land on things, really, to kill them, they're in a way.

1555
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:58,960
But he goes through different planets, trying to see, you know, trying to get through to,

1556
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,440
I guess, rescue the star goddess.

1557
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,040
And I apologize, guys, for some reason we don't have the music tonight.

1558
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:09,000
I don't know what is causing, I may have to close Justin.tv to do that, but we don't have

1559
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,820
music tonight, and I don't know why.

1560
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:17,120
So sorry, guys, you'll just have to, maybe Dark Sakura can hum the tune, I don't know.

1561
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,880
Music sounds very Sonic-y, anyway.

1562
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,880
It does.

1563
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,160
It looks very Sonic-y.

1564
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,160
The game looks very Sonic-y.

1565
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:32,480
Speaking of Sonic, I believe this was an unlock in one of the Sonic collections?

1566
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:40,840
It was, it was in the Sonic Mega Collection Plus on PC, and had a Game Gear release, too.

1567
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:48,000
It also was, it's available on the Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, and also available

1568
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,720
on the Virtual Console.

1569
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,760
But as you go through the game, your health is actually registered in stars, and each

1570
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,360
hit is one star, is that right?

1571
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,280
No, it's the little theme song, because sadly, Ristar wouldn't work.

1572
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
Sorry, guys.

1573
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:11,840
But you also, as you gain momentum in running, you get sparks of stars that go behind you,

1574
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:19,920
and it's called Shooting Star, and so you can fly in different tricks, but it's a pretty

1575
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:21,920
neat little game.

1576
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,520
It had some differences from the Japanese to English versions.

1577
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,120
Planets had different names in the English version.

1578
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:34,000
English one, in the Japanese one, he ran around with a very happy face the whole time, except

1579
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,440
during a boss battle, and in the American one, they gave him the angry face the entire

1580
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,560
time that he had during the boss battles.

1581
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:49,000
There's also a skiing sequence that was added to level five in the US one.

1582
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,840
Ita Mora was a giant cat in the Japanese version, which changed to an ice monster.

1583
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:57,840
There's anti-gravity shoes in round six, different treasure names.

1584
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:04,880
The European version of Ristar actually took advantage of larger resolutions that were

1585
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,400
available on PAL systems.

1586
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:15,360
And actually, the third game on the Game Gear version is, if you play the Japanese version

1587
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:20,320
on an American Game Gear, the third stage is missing.

1588
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:21,320
It just vanished.

1589
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,320
It went away.

1590
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,320
Pretty much.

1591
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:28,840
But then again, if you play, what was it, Burning Street that was on Genesis, if you

1592
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:35,240
put your Japanese cartridge into a US system, either by a converter or whatever, it changes

1593
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,240
to Street to Rage.

1594
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,240
Nice.

1595
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,040
But it was put out by Acclaim, and it was pretty fun.

1596
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,040
Alright.

1597
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:48,480
It got a 9.5 by GameSpot.

1598
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,120
Ristar is your classic game of the week, and you can check that out on just about any Sonic

1599
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,680
Mega collection that's out there.

1600
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,680
Sonic Team!

1601
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:59,520
Game Guru is clarifying, Ristar was available on all the Sonic Mega collections, GameCube,

1602
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,720
PlayStation 2, and Xbox.

1603
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:02,240
So it's out there, waiting for you.

1604
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,380
It's a Sonic Team game, it may as well be Sonic.

1605
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,880
And sadly, it's the only way you're going to hear the music, thanks to our failure this

1606
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,880
week.

1607
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,320
Go on and find it.

1608
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,600
I was going to mention, there was another game that they had gameplay footage of come

1609
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,240
out this week, and that would be Wario Land Shake It.

1610
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:24,040
And what's funny is that game looks very much like Sonic.

1611
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,960
It's weird.

1612
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:26,960
Could be interesting.

1613
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,760
Could be very interesting.

1614
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,760
Alright.

1615
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,440
Well, that's going to do it here for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but we will be back

1616
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,640
with plenty more, and we've got some fun stuff planned for part B. We're going to play the

1617
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,080
match game tonight with all these people in the house.

1618
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,580
You know that's going to be fun.

1619
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:46,500
One chatter and one caller will get to go head-to-head in the OLR match game, and plenty

1620
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,500
more gaming news.

1621
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,720
We haven't even touched, barely, the Xbox 360 and some of this stuff, but we'll get

1622
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,080
to all that when we come back after this break.

1623
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,480
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights, and is podcasted to the world twice

1624
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,480
a week.

1625
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:12,440
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
