00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco!

00:14.000 --> 00:20.480
Tonight July 20th, 2008, at E3, Microsoft announces a Netflix partnership, Sony is set

00:20.480 --> 00:27.760
to launch a new MAG game, and Nintendo announces a Grand Theft Auto portable game.

00:27.760 --> 00:35.000
Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
Radio.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.360
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer

00:40.360 --> 00:41.360
lifestyle.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.080
But we're not cool enough for E3, I'm sorry to say.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.400
No, we just sat here bitter all week long eating our bon-bons and watching it on TV.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
Right, DarkSakura?

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
My lovely coast?

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
Hell no.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.400
Hell no?

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
I did other stuff.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
Like what?

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
Going outside?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
What's that?

00:56.400 --> 01:00.160
Going to the Classic Gaming Expo, not Classic Gaming Expo, what the hell am I saying?

01:00.160 --> 01:01.560
California Xtreme.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.800
You were thinking about going to Classic Gaming Expo, but you actually went to California

01:04.800 --> 01:05.800
Xtreme.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.960
Classic Gaming Expo is dead as far as I know, so.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.800
I think they're supposed to have it again next year, I'm not sure.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.360
I try to keep tabs on MySpace, but we'll see.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.880
But we'll get more on California Xtreme in just a minute, but it would not be a show

01:15.880 --> 01:18.160
if I could not introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.160
Hello.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
How you doing, Loki?

01:20.160 --> 01:21.160
I'm doing okay.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
All right.

01:22.160 --> 01:23.720
Did you, now you did not go to California Xtreme.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.320
No, I did not go to California Xtreme.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.240
What did you do in lieu of E3 this year?

01:27.240 --> 01:33.120
I actually watched E3, watched the press conferences streaming, during work, I might add, because

01:33.120 --> 01:35.280
it technically is work-related, so we sat.

01:35.280 --> 01:37.400
All right, you sell the games, so it's kind of work-related for you.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.160
Yeah, so we, well, yeah, I tried getting that past management.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.120
Luckily, management wasn't there, so we watched it anyways.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.120
Nice.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.640
Yeah, so it was interesting.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
All right.

01:46.640 --> 01:52.040
I ended up reading it through blogs, because I, my day job, I teach, not kids, but adults.

01:52.040 --> 01:58.240
I teach in a corporate environment, and so I didn't really have a chance to watch anything

01:58.240 --> 02:03.760
live, so I just had to kind of read it through blogs, but, you know, people had it covered,

02:03.760 --> 02:07.800
I guess, although it would have been more exciting to be there, but, you know, what

02:07.800 --> 02:08.800
can you do?

02:08.800 --> 02:11.760
You can go to a different expo, that's what you can do, and we'll talk more about that

02:11.760 --> 02:14.640
in a little while, but first, let's hear about the trip that Jamie took this week, which

02:14.640 --> 02:15.640
I'm surprised.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.000
Somebody would do a gaming expo the same week as E3, but you went on a little trip,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
right?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yes.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.920
I went on a little trip today for Saturday, I didn't, you know, it ended today, but I

02:25.920 --> 02:32.560
ran into lots of people that I know, including someone in our chat room right now, GS68,

02:32.560 --> 02:34.400
who actually found me.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.840
Nice hat, by the way.

02:36.840 --> 02:43.000
And I ran into Mel and Melody, I ran into Wendell and some of his buddies, and saw a

02:43.000 --> 02:46.040
few other notable personages.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.640
I actually saw Jason Enos in line.

02:49.640 --> 02:55.800
GS68 has actually posted his share of pictures from the event on his little photo bucket

02:55.800 --> 02:59.880
in our chat room, chat.orangelandsradio.com, and what's this I see here, I think this might

02:59.880 --> 03:00.880
be a picture.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.880
Ah, yes, there is Dark Sockar, our very own little space invader.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.880
How do you get a space invader?

03:05.880 --> 03:06.880
Nice.

03:06.880 --> 03:07.880
Melody and I wanted to steal it.

03:07.880 --> 03:14.280
And some other lady with her ass on the table, right next to you.

03:14.280 --> 03:18.520
You might want to crop that picture, GS68, it's very unflattering to the other lady

03:18.520 --> 03:23.160
who looks like she just pooped out a playing card.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.160
Let me link the chat.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.240
I'm sorry, podcast listeners, because you're thinking like, what?

03:27.240 --> 03:31.440
But I have to post this picture because I'm laughing too hard at it.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.440
I look like hell.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.520
Oh, you look fine.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.520
Like hell.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.240
Look, you don't look nearly as bad as the other lady.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.880
All right, enough about- She did poop a playing card.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.800
Look, what kind of games did you get to play at California Extreme?

03:45.800 --> 03:48.480
Okay, let me grab the phone because I took pictures of everything.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.880
You pay a cover fee, right, to get into this thing, and then you just play three arcade

03:53.880 --> 03:56.320
games from the 80s and 90s all day long, right?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.080
And a few more recent ones.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.600
I got an email with- Dude, there's a spider again!

04:01.600 --> 04:06.760
I got an email with a Journey arcade game picture, so I know you played that at least.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.040
I didn't play it, Melody did.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.520
It made part of my soul hurt.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.520
Why?

04:13.520 --> 04:16.840
Because I cried, you know, from nostalgia.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.320
Did she get the- She finally got the concert tried toward the

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
end of the day.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.080
I was gonna say, you have to get the tape to play.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.080
That's the best part.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.080
Okay, so, games.

04:26.080 --> 04:31.240
I've got a list of stuff I did and did not play.

04:31.240 --> 04:38.000
First of all, they had a demo of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix set up, and they

04:38.000 --> 04:45.840
had a PlayStation 3 set up with the online games, including Puzzle Fighter HD, which

04:45.840 --> 04:50.280
I watched Wendell and Mel play.

04:50.280 --> 04:55.800
Melody and I played Raiden Fighters 2, which was pretty fucking sweet, and I got fifth

04:55.800 --> 04:56.920
highest score.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.760
They had the prop cycle Addams Family there.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
What?

05:00.760 --> 05:04.720
You know the people that have the prop cycle set up to play Addams Family?

05:04.720 --> 05:06.040
No, I haven't seen that.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.480
Oh, you have, too, because we commented on it.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.480
Really?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.200
I've seen the prop cycle, but I've never seen it.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.200
Let me see.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.200
Don't drop my phone.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.200
I won't.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.640
Oh, that is kind of strange.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.880
Is actually someone on a prop cycle- A prop cycle attached to an Addams Family,

05:23.880 --> 05:26.400
and the game runs as you pedal.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
Huh.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
Interesting.

05:28.400 --> 05:35.400
I've had pictures of this set before, so moving on- Oh, that's- My phone's upside down, Rob.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.400
Come on.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.880
Turn back right side up.

05:37.880 --> 05:38.880
Thank you.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.200
Sorry, I had to fix my phone.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.200
Silly iPhone.

05:42.200 --> 05:48.520
Melody played Star Wars Racer Arcade that they had put inside one of these games that

05:48.520 --> 05:53.120
you look into the view hole to do the racing, and I think it was like a submarine or space

05:53.120 --> 05:56.240
game before or something, but it was kind of neat.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.240
They had blasteroids there, which I didn't play, and I was so mad because I took a picture

06:00.240 --> 06:04.440
of a guy in a Big Bang bar shirt, but the picture didn't come out well, and then they

06:04.440 --> 06:07.640
had one of those mini SNK cabinets.

06:07.640 --> 06:15.160
Like there's, if you can see, we had to play on our knees to play it, and we played Puzzle

06:15.160 --> 06:20.760
Bobble, and Melody and I played a sit-down of Crystal Castles, the two-player sit-downs.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.760
Oh, cool.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.760
Like one with a cocktail, yeah.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.560
You set your drink on it.

06:25.560 --> 06:30.560
And then I didn't- Oh, yeah, this is a picture of some dude playing Journey, so-

06:30.560 --> 06:32.720
So is it just arcade game madness or what?

06:32.720 --> 06:35.280
They have these little panels and stuff there, too, right?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
Yeah, panels.

06:36.280 --> 06:42.520
Dan went to the panel that had Steve Ritchie, who's the guy who designed some of the best

06:42.520 --> 06:45.260
pins ever, like Twilight Zone and No Fear.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.160
We actually have a lot of the games that he designed.

06:47.160 --> 06:52.040
By the way, they did have Tapper, but I didn't play.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.040
Awesome.

06:53.040 --> 06:59.320
But they, he went to that panel, and then I went to a panel later on with Dan to see

06:59.320 --> 07:02.240
someone talk about customizing.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.320
I'm trying to be understanding because it was his first panel, it just wasn't very well

07:05.320 --> 07:06.320
presented.

07:06.320 --> 07:10.400
I think, you know, with a little bit of experience, he can do better, but there were some interesting

07:10.400 --> 07:11.760
things.

07:11.760 --> 07:18.400
And then we went to a panel about the guy who made Donkey Kong 2, as in he sprite-ripped

07:18.400 --> 07:23.240
and redid levels to have going after the original four in Donkey Kong.

07:23.240 --> 07:27.040
Because I was going to say, wait, Donkey Kong 2 is Donkey Kong Jr., but this is a different

07:27.040 --> 07:28.040
thing.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.480
This is an actual Donkey Kong 2.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.480
Interesting.

07:30.480 --> 07:36.000
Um, you can find the, he actually has a website and everything, but, and then I went to watch

07:36.000 --> 07:39.760
Tilt, but I only watched the first part of it because I've seen the rest of it, but it's

07:39.760 --> 07:44.360
like about the end of Williams Pinball Division and the Pinball 2000 that came out.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.480
I did play some Episode 1 Pinball.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.480
Cool, cool.

07:47.480 --> 07:51.440
But for other games, I had a Gallagher game.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.440
Like the guy who smashes watermelons, Gallagher?

07:53.440 --> 07:54.440
Yes.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.480
And it's like one of those little gun games like Mad Dog McCree was.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.480
Nice.

07:58.480 --> 08:01.280
And, um, do you shoot watermelons and they explode?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.280
No.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.440
Maybe you can shoot flies off of his, off of a lunch.

08:05.440 --> 08:08.600
And I played a sit-down Cinestar.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
That's cool.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
Very cool.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.600
Beware.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
I live.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.600
Yeah.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.600
There was a Burger Time and I played some Gauntlet.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.840
Uh, Junior Pac-Man, uh, Melody played that.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.040
So you played it all.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.600
I mean, there's some, some, some notable, there's a picture of my foot.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.560
Um, I also, um, they had a Big Bang bar, which of course, you know, I had to play Big Bang

08:26.560 --> 08:27.560
bar.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.680
It's a chain, right?

08:28.680 --> 08:31.080
And then, um, Oh, there's my beer.

08:31.080 --> 08:36.320
I also played, um, an eight ball deluxe, which is the set, I think as far, if I'm right,

08:36.320 --> 08:42.640
it's the second highest, um, grossing, um, flipper using pinball table.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.520
The first being Adam's family.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.040
And then I played the Ted Nugent pinball, which was actually really good.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.040
I didn't even know that existed.

08:50.040 --> 08:54.640
Gallagher 98 Pac-Mania, Monopoly, Pango, they're the Pango in a really good condition.

08:54.640 --> 08:55.640
I love Pango.

08:55.640 --> 08:57.600
It's a good, pretty Tron.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.720
Um, how many people were there tons, there was just a lot of people.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.160
Um, although I honestly don't know that the turnout this year was as good as last they

09:07.160 --> 09:08.160
didn't have the auction.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.880
Do you think it might have to do with the fact they're holding at the same time as E3

09:11.880 --> 09:12.880
too?

09:12.880 --> 09:16.400
I don't think that was really their choice because from what I understand, they were

09:16.400 --> 09:19.400
trying to avoid scheduling around the jazz festival in San Jose.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.720
Now this one's a cool one.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.880
If you can see, it's a black Spiderman pinball machine.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.800
They only made, I think 500 of them.

09:26.800 --> 09:32.320
So someone brought it in and if you hit the right flipper button, you can play it in Spanish.

09:32.320 --> 09:37.280
And then there's this guy here who had a Flynn's t-shirt on, which if anyone is a big Tron

09:37.280 --> 09:42.640
nut like me, you know that that's the name of the arcade that, um, the guy had in.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.840
And then this was really cool.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.880
Um, someone took, um, the wizard pinball table, which was the one that Elton John was playing

09:48.880 --> 09:56.520
in, um, in, uh, Tommy and made the big boots and put it up on a stand to play on, like

09:56.520 --> 09:57.520
in Tommy.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.520
All right.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.360
I have to address this because Bobby's saying this in our chat room, chat that orange lounge

10:00.360 --> 10:03.880
radio.com and our old buddy, Bobby black Wolf, who's on before us and all games.com.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.520
He says it wasn't the same time as E3, E3 ended Thursday.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.600
If anything, it made it easier for someone to attend it.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.520
It just, they could just hop up after E3.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.080
But I'm thinking like, okay, I've been to E3 in the past, granted it was a lot different

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
back then.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.640
I know how I felt at the end of E3.

10:17.640 --> 10:19.280
I didn't want to do shit.

10:19.280 --> 10:23.720
The idea of another gaming expo was like the furthest thing from my mind.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.600
If somebody had told me, Hey, let's go to a gaming expo tomorrow, it would be like,

10:26.600 --> 10:28.840
you've got to be kidding me.

10:28.840 --> 10:33.520
So I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too close

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
together.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.520
You got to give it at least a month.

10:35.520 --> 10:40.080
Uh, it would have been really tight and I just have to say the one day of me going,

10:40.080 --> 10:46.560
um, all granted, I didn't have, um, my, the medication that I have to take, but, um, I,

10:46.560 --> 10:53.720
I got so tired just walking around and, um, cause we, we left the house at, at, uh, at

10:53.720 --> 10:58.680
10 and we got there just a little bit afternoon, um, actually closer to one.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.520
So Dan could hit, hit that panel he wanted to go to.

11:02.520 --> 11:10.320
Um, but just walking around all day, just all day walking and I was pretty much dead

11:10.320 --> 11:11.320
tired.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.480
I did nothing but sleep today.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.800
You better prepare yourself for packs.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.160
That's going to be three days.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.640
I'm going to bring better shoes.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.640
All right.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.640
Oh my God.

11:18.640 --> 11:19.640
Shoes.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.640
All right.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.640
Oh my God.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.640
Shoes.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.640
Thank you for the lovely report.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
I'm sure we'll hear more from Dan later.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.640
Possibly.

11:25.640 --> 11:26.640
Um, well no.

11:26.640 --> 11:27.640
All right.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.640
But go to our forum.

11:28.640 --> 11:35.440
Um, in our, um, our orange lounge chat area, I did post up a, uh, the review that Dan wrote

11:35.440 --> 11:41.040
for us since we have nowhere on the front page to do it yet yet.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.440
All right.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.600
Um, but Dan, Dan wrote a lengthy review.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.040
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week while you weren't attending any cool expos like the

11:51.040 --> 11:52.040
cool kids?

11:52.040 --> 11:53.840
Um, it was okay.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.400
Like um, all right.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.200
So I played the Tales of Vesperia demo, which was released this week.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
Very pitiful.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.160
I might say that they only released two demos during their bringing it home.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.160
Oh yeah.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
You brought it home.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.160
All right.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.160
Woo wee.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.520
I'm not as enthusiastic as the rest of the event went.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.800
Um, Tales of Vesperia.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.100
I didn't like it.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.600
I really wanted to like it.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.400
I already had it preordered, you know, it looked like a game I could probably get into

12:21.400 --> 12:24.720
kind of like, you know, eternal Sonata or something like that.

12:24.720 --> 12:30.520
I just, what did it for me is I didn't like really the, I thought it was a little cheesy

12:30.520 --> 12:33.260
and I mean the graphics are awesome.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.560
The graphics are just like eternal Sonata.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
Yeah.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
Combat was kind of annoying.

12:37.560 --> 12:43.560
I didn't like the combat one bit that kind of ruined it for me.

12:43.560 --> 12:48.720
Um, it's all kind of real time and you switch between your characters and you cast spells

12:48.720 --> 12:52.360
and stuff and everyone kind of is on autopilot, which kind of sucked.

12:52.360 --> 12:57.840
Um, I liked eternal Sonata a lot better where it was turn based and you could do all that

12:57.840 --> 12:59.840
real time stuff within like a certain time limit.

12:59.840 --> 13:04.680
I thought that was pretty cool, but this was kind of all over the place.

13:04.680 --> 13:09.240
And um, then my buddy played Too Human.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.840
I didn't get a chance to play it because I tried downloading the demo twice, both times

13:12.840 --> 13:14.220
it was corrupted.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.040
So that was awesome.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.080
And here it was just mediocre.

13:18.080 --> 13:22.160
So I don't know, but he's going to buy it because he liked, you know, games like Conan

13:22.160 --> 13:25.120
and stuff like that, which, you know, I kind of like that too.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.200
It doesn't really take much to impress me as far as action games go.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.400
I mean, I don't know.

13:30.400 --> 13:37.160
But um, I did play some DS games, I played Metal Slug 7 a bit and I didn't really play

13:37.160 --> 13:40.780
the main game of it because I mean, shit, it's just Metal Slug.

13:40.780 --> 13:44.120
But they had these like challenge mode things in there and that was kind of interesting.

13:44.120 --> 13:48.480
You had different tasks and once you finish those, you go up in rank and stuff like that

13:48.480 --> 13:49.600
and it gets harder.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.080
So that, that's kind of cool with the added replayability.

13:53.080 --> 13:59.900
And then I played, um, more point blank DS, which the DS, I don't know.

13:59.900 --> 14:04.040
At first it was pretty fun with the DS stylus, but it's just not as accurate as firing the

14:04.040 --> 14:05.340
gun.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.640
So it's kind of frustrating at times because you're tapping.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.120
That's strange because I would think when you tap, you're tapping right on it, whereas

14:11.120 --> 14:12.560
exactly button.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.440
But sometimes the, I don't know if they had a calibration option or whatever, but it wasn't

14:16.440 --> 14:17.800
exact.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.960
So that was kind of annoying.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.520
And um, what else did I play?

14:22.520 --> 14:27.800
I tried some more of a portal still live, which was that DS, or actually it's still

14:27.800 --> 14:32.200
live DS, I guess, which is that little, uh, like portal game, the 2D one.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.320
That was kind of fun, short.

14:35.320 --> 14:39.080
Um, and what else did I play?

14:39.080 --> 14:40.560
I think that was pretty much it.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.560
I was just kind of going all over the place.

14:42.560 --> 14:47.760
Oh, I went back to play some old Xbox live arcade games, played Zuma some more, because

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
that's fun.

14:48.760 --> 14:49.760
Nelly's cool.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.320
Because now that I have it hooked up to the TV again, Nelly's like, oh, Zuma, I can play

14:52.320 --> 14:53.320
this again.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.320
So.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
All right.

14:55.320 --> 15:00.160
Sounds, sounds like you were keeping yourself busy with what you already have, games you

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
already have to beat.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.160
Exactly.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.920
And it's just like looking at, you know, there was stuff that came out this week, you know,

15:04.920 --> 15:08.840
Xbox live arcade stuff, but just like, all of it sucked.

15:08.840 --> 15:14.720
And uh, ooh, Tuesday, this Tuesday, my DS, I gotta dust it off with what's coming out

15:14.720 --> 15:15.720
this Tuesday.

15:15.720 --> 15:18.160
I'll tell you later in the show when we get to release dates.

15:18.160 --> 15:21.520
However, uh, my gaming week, I'll keep it short, um, because there really wasn't a lot

15:21.520 --> 15:22.520
to it.

15:22.520 --> 15:26.400
It was the same stuff I've been playing, Civ Rev, uh, Space Invaders stream on PSP, but

15:26.400 --> 15:28.240
I had a little bit of renaissance as well.

15:28.240 --> 15:33.320
I, uh, when I saw Nintendo's press conference and, and some of the games they were debuting,

15:33.320 --> 15:36.740
I was like, wow, this looks pretty much the same as, as GameCube stuff.

15:36.740 --> 15:42.040
So I went back to the GameCube and I decided I wanted to play Animal Crossing again.

15:42.040 --> 15:46.040
So I started a brand new town in Animal Crossing and started from the top.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.360
And um, it's so funny.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.760
I think my roommate, uh, summed it up perfectly.

15:49.760 --> 15:53.120
He walked in on me playing the game this morning after I'd played it a little bit yesterday.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.200
He's like, what's the point of this game?

15:57.200 --> 15:59.120
He's kind of like, why do you like this game?

15:59.120 --> 16:00.640
It seems like there's no point.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.360
And I'm like, you're kind of right.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.760
There is no point.

16:03.760 --> 16:04.760
That's the point.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.040
It's like the Sims.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.880
There's no real point to that either.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.800
But I thought I would, uh, play it to try and collect more of the NES games.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.840
Cause remember that was one awesome thing about Animal Crossing on the GameCube is that

16:15.840 --> 16:18.080
it had all the old school NES games buried in it.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.960
Like you could get like Clu Clu Land.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.200
How awesome is that?

16:21.200 --> 16:23.920
And Donkey Kong Jr. Math.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.720
Neither of those games on Virtual Console if I remember right.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.400
So there you have it.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.160
Um, and then I also, I'll tell you what, cause I was talking about it last week.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.160
I made good on this.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.640
I started playing F-Zero GX on the GameCube again cause that is a great racing game.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.300
Boy I wish they would make a high def version of that cause that would be a lot of fun.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.640
The cool thing is the GameCube version supports widescreen and progressive scan.

16:44.640 --> 16:49.560
So it's already outputting, you know, pretty much the same level that other Wii games would.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.680
You know, granted the slightly more advanced Wii hardware would probably make a better

16:52.680 --> 16:53.680
F-Zero game.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.360
But I want to see something like F-Zero on like 720, 1080 level.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.080
That would be awesome.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.440
Was that like F-Zero?

17:00.440 --> 17:02.920
That's a fun racing game.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.400
And I was a little sad they didn't announce that, a new F-Zero game at their press conference.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.440
But what can you do?

17:07.440 --> 17:14.080
But you have to understand the E3 wasn't for the core gamer, uh, for at least Nintendo.

17:14.080 --> 17:18.320
So all the stuff that they announced was casual stuff, right?

17:18.320 --> 17:23.320
Uh, GameGuru in chat, chat.org.com does correct me and says Donkey Kong Junior Math is on

17:23.320 --> 17:26.120
the Virtual Console, but it's not worth $5.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.120
Correct.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.800
It's not worth $5 considering you can get an Animal Crossing for free, there you have

17:31.800 --> 17:32.800
it.

17:32.800 --> 17:38.480
So, alright, um, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping.

17:38.480 --> 17:43.040
Uh, this week as we announced at our own E3 press conference last week, you will get one

17:43.040 --> 17:47.440
big show, hopefully everything on the technical end works, but you will get one big show.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.760
There will no longer be part A and B, so the podcast feed might look a little different

17:50.760 --> 17:54.320
because of that, but that'll be pretty cool.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.320
And that's it.

17:55.320 --> 18:01.480
Otherwise, continue to support us by giving us positive reviews on iTunes, we always appreciate

18:01.480 --> 18:02.480
that.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.440
There's been a few new ones that have popped up lately, some nice, very nice five star

18:05.440 --> 18:06.440
reviews.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.160
In fact, right now, if I checked correctly, we have exactly 69 reviews on iTunes right

18:10.160 --> 18:11.760
now, which is a great number to be at.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.760
So thank you very much.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.520
Make some more, as nice as the 69 number is.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.960
So don't forget that.

18:16.960 --> 18:21.960
Also, our LiveJournal community, we are at community Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, so

18:21.960 --> 18:22.960
look us up there.

18:22.960 --> 18:29.120
Facebook, OL Army, on Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio, so we are your social networking BFFs

18:29.120 --> 18:32.040
on any of those sites you want to be our buds on.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
This week a little different, um, because we had E3 happen this week, nothing but press

18:38.000 --> 18:40.320
conference stuff in this, uh, half of the show.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.440
We're going to talk about kind of the big three press conferences, and our thoughts

18:43.440 --> 18:44.440
on it.

18:44.440 --> 18:48.340
Since I'm assuming a lot of you have probably already heard the news, let's try to dissect

18:48.340 --> 18:49.340
it a little bit tonight.

18:49.340 --> 18:50.560
Loke, you want to start us off.

18:50.560 --> 18:56.480
Okay, so of course the big last minute thing that they did for the Xbox, um, or Microsoft

18:56.480 --> 19:02.200
conference was announcing that Final Fantasy 13 would be coming to the Xbox 360 day and

19:02.200 --> 19:09.600
date in the US, which, you know, is a big, you know, blow to PS3's exclusive, uh, content.

19:09.600 --> 19:14.160
In fact, if I remember correctly, I believe the three games that they wanted, uh, to break

19:14.160 --> 19:20.280
exclusivity on was Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy 13, and Metal Gear Solid 4.

19:20.280 --> 19:26.680
Well, two out of three ain't bad, so, um, yeah, that's a pretty big thing, I think.

19:26.680 --> 19:32.760
Um, it is not going to be coming, it's not exclusive in, or not coming to, uh, the Xbox

19:32.760 --> 19:35.120
360 in Japan, though.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.120
Interesting.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.560
But in the, um, US, it will be coming out day and date, so.

19:39.560 --> 19:44.400
Which really kind of shows that this whole move is motivated nothing by but sales, basically

19:44.400 --> 19:46.560
that they feel they have a better chance of penetrating the marketplace.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.880
I think so, yeah.

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
Very interesting.

19:48.880 --> 19:53.920
But I, my curiosity is how long is this, is it going to make this game be out?

19:53.920 --> 19:56.720
I mean, like, how far do we have to wait for this game?

19:56.720 --> 20:00.720
Because they admitted, they haven't even really started developing this game for the 360.

20:00.720 --> 20:04.240
I mean, they've been doing it on some type of PC design, like what do they call it, Crystal

20:04.240 --> 20:05.240
or something?

20:05.240 --> 20:07.080
They do it on, you know, it's probably their own design platform.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.680
Sure, I mean, I think here's the thing, it's not really going to be an issue with storage,

20:11.680 --> 20:14.520
it's not going to be a problem, you know, getting it, obviously it's not going to be

20:14.520 --> 20:16.200
on one disc, but that's fine.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.760
Um, I think it's actually not going to hold them up too much because it's a lot easier

20:19.760 --> 20:25.240
to develop for the 360 than it is for the PS3, and I know that Square Enix has a lot

20:25.240 --> 20:32.160
more, um, experience developing for the 360 right now, rather than the PS3, so.

20:32.160 --> 20:36.080
I don't think it's really going to hold it up any more than localizing it would.

20:36.080 --> 20:40.480
Uh, Maysatsuma in chat asked the question that I've been actually getting asked a lot

20:40.480 --> 20:45.200
this week because I've been pretty open on this show that I have, I had no plans to get

20:45.200 --> 20:49.240
a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy 13 came out, so now this is a, you know, a question

20:49.240 --> 20:51.720
I've been getting a lot this week, as I'm sure a lot of people like me have.

20:51.720 --> 20:56.320
Uh, Maysatsuma says, will you have a PS, I'm sorry, will you buy a PS3 now?

20:56.320 --> 21:00.040
You always said you'll buy a PS3 when Final Fantasy 13 comes out.

21:00.040 --> 21:04.000
Um, not for this, now, I don't need to.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.160
The question is, will Sony be able to land other exclusives, Kingdom, that I am interested

21:09.160 --> 21:14.120
in, like Kingdom Hearts 3, possibly Final Fantasy 13 versus whatever else is coming

21:14.120 --> 21:15.120
out that I haven't thought of yet.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.840
I imagine eventually I'm going to want that Blu-ray player, just because that's where

21:18.840 --> 21:21.840
the video place is, and, you know, I'm one of those people that, well, as long as I'm

21:21.840 --> 21:25.240
going to get a Blu-ray player, but I see no need to run out and buy one now.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.960
It's, in fact, if I had ran out and bought one, and a lot of people are feeling this

21:28.960 --> 21:34.120
thing, if I had ran out and bought one for Final Fantasy 13 before, I would be hurting

21:34.120 --> 21:35.120
right now.

21:35.120 --> 21:39.600
I would be hurting, not only was, you know, is Sony likely to come down in price on those

21:39.600 --> 21:43.120
systems later, and we'll hear more about that later, I'm sure, but, you know.

21:43.120 --> 21:48.080
Well, the thing I think also, too, you have to look at is, from the publisher's standpoint,

21:48.080 --> 21:51.360
when they put this game out, and it's not even necessarily this game, because I'm thinking

21:51.360 --> 21:55.720
Last Remnant's going to be out way before this, I mean, when that comes out, they're

21:55.720 --> 22:00.760
going to look at the sales of that game on both consoles, and, if it's anything like

22:00.760 --> 22:04.920
Grand Theft Auto IV was, it's going to be a lot more on the 360 than it is on the PS3.

22:04.920 --> 22:09.040
Now, that may not be the case, obviously it's not going to be the case in Japan, but they

22:09.040 --> 22:13.800
have to look at each market separately, and kind of base their decisions on that, because

22:13.800 --> 22:18.960
if they were just to base it all on, you know, the Japanese market, then we wouldn't be getting

22:18.960 --> 22:21.040
anything on the 360.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.880
I got two questions, first is for Jamie, because I haven't heard anything yet, and I know you

22:24.880 --> 22:28.880
like Final Fantasy like the rest of us, what was your reaction to the news?

22:28.880 --> 22:31.640
I really didn't care.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.640
Right.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.200
I have both systems.

22:34.200 --> 22:39.720
That leads into my next question, that you and Loki own both systems, knowing that Final

22:39.720 --> 22:43.200
Fantasy XIII, I guess you could say for all practical purposes, was being designed for

22:43.200 --> 22:47.860
the PlayStation 3, now it's coming out for the 360, do you think you're more inclined

22:47.860 --> 22:51.740
to get it on PlayStation 3, or what system do you think you might ultimately get this

22:51.740 --> 22:52.740
game on?

22:52.740 --> 22:54.040
Or have you even decided yet?

22:54.040 --> 22:59.200
Probably PS3, because if that's what it was designed for, then that's what it was designed

22:59.200 --> 23:03.960
for, but it doesn't mean that, you know, later on I won't pick it up dirt cheap for Xbox

23:03.960 --> 23:04.960
360.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.840
I mean, depends on features.

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
Loki?

23:07.840 --> 23:11.080
I couldn't care less what system it was originally designed for, if it's coming out on the 360

23:11.080 --> 23:15.440
and buying it on the 360, and that's just because I like the achievement system that

23:15.440 --> 23:19.440
they have in place, I don't give a shit about these fucking trophies.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.800
There are PlayStation 3 exclusive games I'm gonna be buying for the PS3, but it's pretty

23:23.800 --> 23:28.600
much, if it's coming out on the 360 and the PS3, I will always be picking it up on the

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
360.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.840
What if they come out and say, you know what, the 360 version did have to take a little

23:32.840 --> 23:33.840
hit in quality?

23:33.840 --> 23:34.840
I don't care.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
I mean, it's gonna...

23:35.840 --> 23:36.840
Wow.

23:36.840 --> 23:41.120
Well, now if I were you, if I heard one iota of the 360's gonna have to sacrifice something,

23:41.120 --> 23:42.120
I'd pick it up on PS3.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.120
I mean, look at...

23:43.120 --> 23:44.660
I don't give a shit about achievements, so...

23:44.660 --> 23:49.580
Name one game out there that runs better on the PS3 than the 360.

23:49.580 --> 23:50.640
There isn't one.

23:50.640 --> 23:52.360
It's always the other way around.

23:52.360 --> 23:56.240
Sony Fanboys and chat.orangethesontraday.com, please.

23:56.240 --> 23:59.560
I hear oblivion's a little bit graphically better, but I don't know, that's...

23:59.560 --> 24:05.800
Yeah, but we're talking, like, marginally, I mean, like, this isn't gonna be, you know,

24:05.800 --> 24:11.180
breaking any sort of, you know, there's no discernible difference in between the two.

24:11.180 --> 24:15.800
You have to really, I mean, look at all the games that come out now and they do that stupid

24:15.800 --> 24:19.540
comparison between the 360 and PS3 versions.

24:19.540 --> 24:25.040
There's, like, minimal differences, unless, you know, you're talking, you know, when the

24:25.040 --> 24:29.900
PS3 version comes out and there's, like, lag issues, frame rate issues, freezing issues

24:29.900 --> 24:32.400
and stuff like that.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
I don't know.

24:33.400 --> 24:39.880
It's just, it's not worth picking up on the PS3 for.

24:39.880 --> 24:44.320
Now, not to say that, like I said, there's stuff on the PS3 I definitely want.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.200
Resistance Fall Man 2.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.280
Fuck yeah, I will be getting that on the PS3.

24:48.280 --> 24:51.360
All right, a couple people, a couple comments in chat, I know Jamie wants to say something

24:51.360 --> 24:52.360
too.

24:52.360 --> 24:57.000
Burnout Paradise is a game that's being mentioned, and Joshi16 gives the lulz with Metal Gear

24:57.000 --> 24:58.520
Solid 4 plays better.

24:58.520 --> 25:01.360
Yeah, but Burnout Paradise, okay, look at Burnout Paradise.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.520
Hold on, let's let Jamie say it, because she wants to say something, I'm gonna go.

25:03.520 --> 25:08.640
I was just gonna say, still, all of that actually means really nothing to me, because I had

25:08.640 --> 25:13.000
already decided to get it on, you know, I had kept it in my head open that if it came

25:13.000 --> 25:19.240
out on Xbox 360, I don't, first of all, it's not coming out in Japan on Xbox 360.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.440
They're not going to get the release.

25:21.440 --> 25:26.880
So this means that I can actually interact with a larger community on the PS3 version,

25:26.880 --> 25:27.880
first of all.

25:27.880 --> 25:35.200
I don't care about achievements, and I really don't care about going online, so, I mean,

25:35.200 --> 25:39.820
I would be able to find more stuff, you know, a larger community, especially for me who

25:39.820 --> 25:45.240
loves the fan side of it, that and, you know, honestly think that the controller scheme

25:45.240 --> 25:48.600
lends itself better to RPGs on the PlayStation than on Xbox.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.080
But the controller scheme's almost identical, I mean, we're talking like-

25:51.080 --> 25:54.500
I've heard the control thing before, is that the PlayStation, I would even, you know, even

25:54.500 --> 25:58.060
though I'm kinda not getting a PS3, I would agree that the PlayStation 3's got a better

25:58.060 --> 26:01.420
controller than the 360, but I don't mind the 360's controller.

26:01.420 --> 26:07.080
They're both, I mean, we're talking like the analog stick being moved in place of the directional

26:07.080 --> 26:09.360
pad, I mean, that means absolutely nothing.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.760
I don't know, there's something about the stability.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.760
I'm sorry, I-

26:12.760 --> 26:15.560
And as far as the online community goes, what's that have to do with platforms?

26:15.560 --> 26:19.320
I mean, when people are playing like Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that, the community

26:19.320 --> 26:20.320
is-

26:20.320 --> 26:21.320
The other half of the fun for me is-

26:21.320 --> 26:23.240
The games are identical in both systems.

26:23.240 --> 26:27.120
The other half of the fun for me is actually going on international sites and seeing what

26:27.120 --> 26:29.680
the, you know, the world reaction is.

26:29.680 --> 26:34.820
I love looking at fan art, I love, you know, finding fan sites, I think it's fun.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.320
But that's fine, but that's not platform specific.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.600
You're not gonna only have PS3 fans.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.600
That doesn't necessarily-

26:40.600 --> 26:45.320
That'd be like, you know, saying, for example, that, you know, you have fans for Eternal

26:45.320 --> 26:49.400
Sonata, but there's gonna be fans for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 version.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.300
It doesn't matter, as long as you're playing it.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.720
People are playing the game, it doesn't matter what platform choice they have, there's still

26:55.720 --> 26:58.320
gonna be fans out there, and the community's still gonna be out there, regardless of what

26:58.320 --> 27:00.960
system you pick it up on.

27:00.960 --> 27:05.720
It doesn't, like, lock you into an exclusive fan club that only 360 fans can, you know,

27:05.720 --> 27:08.680
visit people that play the 360 stuff versus PS3.

27:08.680 --> 27:13.360
Alright, let me let the chat have the last word here.

27:13.360 --> 27:17.880
Osfer says, isn't Versus 13 still exclusive to the PS3 in the US?

27:17.880 --> 27:20.740
Even if it is, I'm sure that game will jump ship too.

27:20.740 --> 27:25.280
Sales will probably be a big question as to whether that happens or not, I'd imagine.

27:25.280 --> 27:28.560
Well, Versus 13, I don't think it's been announced for the US yet.

27:28.560 --> 27:32.200
It's still Japanese only, and if that's the case, then yeah, it probably still is PS3.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.880
And well, they showed the trailer at E3 a couple years ago, so I'm thinking it's gonna

27:35.880 --> 27:36.880
be good.

27:36.880 --> 27:41.080
Yeah, but they also showed the trailer for Star Ocean, like, two years ago too, so.

27:41.080 --> 27:45.760
As Separoth1215 and Xenocore agree, say the D-pad on the 360 is what's horrible, and I

27:45.760 --> 27:49.960
agree, you cannot, that D-pad on 360 is awful.

27:49.960 --> 27:54.060
That's the problem with the controller right there, is that D-pad, because I don't like

27:54.060 --> 27:58.320
to use the analog stick with a lot of Xbox Live arcade games, and that D-pad sucks.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.400
Like, especially for, like, the retro games, and fighters.

28:01.400 --> 28:06.360
That's the thing, that's what the PlayStation 3 controller, I think, is better as fighters.

28:06.360 --> 28:07.360
But...

28:07.360 --> 28:11.720
You know what, if they wanted to take a clue from the best controller ever made, they should

28:11.720 --> 28:17.840
look at the Sega Saturn dual analog controller for their model.

28:17.840 --> 28:21.640
I like the Super Nintendo controller, it was a lot less complicated, but I...

28:21.640 --> 28:25.960
Well, the Super Nintendo controller, though, is also one of the, I think, the primary inspirations

28:25.960 --> 28:27.480
for the PlayStation controller.

28:27.480 --> 28:28.480
True, true.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.720
Well, I'm sorry that you'll be handicapped when you get to the fighting game portions

28:31.720 --> 28:32.720
of Final Fantasy 13.

28:32.720 --> 28:33.720
Alright, shut up.

28:33.720 --> 28:34.720
We're moving on.

28:34.720 --> 28:35.720
Alright.

28:35.720 --> 28:40.560
Uh, other big news out of Microsoft's press conference, that has to do with the installation

28:40.560 --> 28:43.480
of Xbox 360 games to your hard drive.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.880
They actually announced that now you're going to be able to actually copy the games to your

28:46.880 --> 28:49.600
hard drive, so you can play the games directly off your hard drive.

28:49.600 --> 28:53.720
But if you're thinking this means, haha, I can get them from Gamefly, copy them to my

28:53.720 --> 28:58.440
hard drive and send them back, no, you still have to have the original disc to play the

28:58.440 --> 28:59.440
game.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.320
I'm curious how long that takes to get cracked, though.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
Yeah, not long.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.760
I'm curious because people could probably burn their own CDs and bypass it.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.720
I'm very interested to see how they security lock this.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.320
We'll see, we'll see.

29:11.320 --> 29:16.920
Also, you're going to be able to access the marketplace on the web, so if you, you know,

29:16.920 --> 29:20.920
you're not next to the 360, you're, you know, surfing the internet at work like you shouldn't

29:20.920 --> 29:24.580
be, you can actually go on the internet and queue up downloads to automatically go to

29:24.580 --> 29:27.200
your 360, which sounds kind of interesting.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.240
Something pretty awesome is if they had, like, a mode, and they have this, I think, with

29:30.240 --> 29:36.720
a PS3 a little bit, where you can access your content from, you know, any hotspot or something

29:36.720 --> 29:40.940
like that, but what if you could, like, say, leave your 360 in, like, a standby mode and

29:40.940 --> 29:46.540
queue something up to download on your 360 from a PC that's, you know, nowhere near it

29:46.540 --> 29:50.720
and then actually have it downloaded while you're out, you know what I mean?

29:50.720 --> 29:51.720
Right.

29:51.720 --> 29:55.000
So, I guess that's kind of cool, though, if you, you know, don't like all those loading

29:55.000 --> 29:56.720
times on Xbox 360 on certain games.

29:56.720 --> 30:00.240
It doesn't, it doesn't sound like it's gonna really help the load times too much, it's

30:00.240 --> 30:03.200
only gonna improve them by 30% from what I read.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.200
Hmm.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.200
Interesting.

30:05.200 --> 30:06.200
But, I mean.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.000
What games do you think will benefit most from this?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.040
You can even do multi-disc installs, though, apparently, like, if you want to install,

30:11.040 --> 30:14.160
like, disc 2 and 3 of Lost Odyssey on your drive, you could do that.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.080
I don't know why you would, but you could.

30:16.080 --> 30:22.560
Let me, it's nice that it's an option, you know, that's nice in case you want to do that

30:22.560 --> 30:24.840
and you don't have to, but.

30:24.840 --> 30:29.480
It would be nicer if I didn't have to have the original disc, but I, I mean, granted,

30:29.480 --> 30:33.120
I understand why they're doing it that way, if they didn't, piracy would run rampant,

30:33.120 --> 30:37.240
but I wish there was some other type of way it could be validated that I actually own

30:37.240 --> 30:41.360
and bought the game, because I would love to just, you know, not have to swap discs

30:41.360 --> 30:44.840
out all the time, like, just pop up a menu on my 360, pick the game and go.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.000
Like the arcade games.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.000
I love that.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.160
It would be nice, but I, I mean, I understand why that's.

30:49.160 --> 30:52.880
Well, they could do that, but, you know.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.400
Maybe authenticate, authenticating with a serial number or something.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.280
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, like a serial key, just like they do with MMOs and

30:58.280 --> 30:59.280
PC games.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.280
Question mark, I don't know.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.200
Xbox, think about that for next year's E3.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.800
I would love to be able to do that.

31:03.800 --> 31:08.120
It seems to me that the, the key code would probably be the best way.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.640
But that's also a problem too, like if you look, I know this is a small market, but rental

31:11.640 --> 31:16.120
market, you know, if you're renting it out with the manual and the key codes in there,

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
then.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.120
Yeah.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.120
Yeah, we'll see.

31:20.120 --> 31:27.360
Well, for anyone who's been looking for a sequel to Portal, there is an official one.

31:27.360 --> 31:29.400
It's actually Portal Still Alive.

31:29.400 --> 31:36.960
It's going to be basically the, the single player story that was in Orange Box with some

31:36.960 --> 31:37.960
new challenges.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.320
It's supposed to be on the Xbox Live Arcade.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.080
Nothing about PC or PS3.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.000
I think they already have this on the PC actually.

31:45.000 --> 31:50.440
They released a map pack that was based off the Flash Portal game, the 2D one, and that's

31:50.440 --> 31:51.800
what these levels are.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.600
Those are those same levels that were available on the PC, I want to say for free, so.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.680
But they've been, uh, la-di-daing this thing as an exclusive on the 360, right?

31:59.680 --> 32:04.720
It is exclusive on the 360, this version of the game, like as a standalone thing, but

32:04.720 --> 32:09.840
it really, it's just those download maps that were available on the PC for free.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.240
You know what though I hear about this game?

32:11.240 --> 32:12.240
There's no GLaDOS.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.560
That kind of makes me sad, but.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
That's sadness.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
It is sadness.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.360
But hopefully there will still be cake.

32:18.360 --> 32:22.340
Maybe this time, Jamie, maybe there's pie at the end this time.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.440
But there's no story.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.600
It's just challenge levels.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.920
It's like the VR missions and.

32:27.920 --> 32:32.000
I guess, Jamie, you were, you were quite the fan of Portal and I think a lot of the reason

32:32.000 --> 32:34.660
you liked it was the humor in it and the story, right?

32:34.660 --> 32:39.820
Does this kind of, I don't know, to me this seems a little bit milking, but I, I enjoyed

32:39.820 --> 32:41.160
the game in Portal 2.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.160
I really did.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.680
So, but I'm kind of curious, what do you think about this?

32:44.680 --> 32:49.160
Being that there's kind of less story, more just puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.120
For the people who like the puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, that's good for them.

32:52.120 --> 32:53.840
I just want snarky commentary.

32:53.840 --> 32:57.560
If there's no snarky commentary, then.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.240
But you could make your own.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.240
You know what?

33:00.240 --> 33:02.720
I'll let Dan play it and then I'll provide the snarky commentary.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.720
Alright.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
You know what would make this game awesome?

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
What?

33:05.720 --> 33:11.040
But they're, well, other than cake, is if later on for a few more Microsoft points they

33:11.040 --> 33:16.400
could release a level editor for the, you know, arcade game and then release it where

33:16.400 --> 33:17.640
you can share levels.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.240
But then what would they do for the actual Portal 2?

33:20.240 --> 33:21.540
For the actual Portal 2?

33:21.540 --> 33:22.540
I don't know.

33:22.540 --> 33:26.080
Well, I mean, this might be Portal 2, but you know what I'm talking about, like a Portal

33:26.080 --> 33:28.080
actual full sequel with story editing.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.800
Well, they can add some additional elements.

33:29.800 --> 33:35.720
I think for the Portal PC game they had levels and stuff with alternate gravity sections

33:35.720 --> 33:38.280
where you're actually on the ceiling and stuff like that.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.360
Really twisty, weird stuff.

33:40.360 --> 33:44.240
So if they add that into Portal 2, and I think Portal 2 is supposed to be kind of different

33:44.240 --> 33:48.120
than Portal 1 altogether, you know, kind of a different environment, more like Half-Life,

33:48.120 --> 33:51.520
then, yeah, there's a lot more to do.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.560
Maybe the lesser face is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.

33:54.560 --> 33:58.440
Plus there's, like, the guy that sounds like Colonel Sanders in there, so.

33:58.440 --> 34:00.320
Oh, the G-Man?

34:00.320 --> 34:08.600
No, no, the new guy, the new Ghost of Portal, you know, creator guy or whatever.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.880
The one whose initials that you enter into the website to do the test that you can't

34:12.880 --> 34:13.880
save the result of.

34:13.880 --> 34:14.880
I guess.

34:14.880 --> 34:19.680
SSJ100 Matt says in chat, they better give a free Carvel cake coupon with the new Portal

34:19.680 --> 34:20.680
because they lied to us last time.

34:20.680 --> 34:21.680
That would be funny.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.580
That would be great.

34:23.580 --> 34:28.280
And some folks in chat are imagining the play at home with Dark Soccer making the commentary

34:28.280 --> 34:29.880
to Dan while he's playing.

34:29.880 --> 34:35.200
Joshi16 says, Dark Soccer to Dan, play better!

34:35.200 --> 34:38.840
And ActDef says, complete the puzzle or the cube dies!

34:38.840 --> 34:41.480
No, no, no.

34:41.480 --> 34:44.640
Half the time with Dan playing is me just trying to shut up because I figured it out

34:44.640 --> 34:48.560
the puzzle, only I get too motion sick to do it.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.760
So I'll be sitting there going, hmm, and he'll be like, what?

34:50.760 --> 34:54.400
I'll be like, you should have done the portal over there, because then it'll come up over

34:54.400 --> 34:56.840
here, and if you do it this way, then this will happen.

34:56.840 --> 35:00.080
He's like, oh.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.880
He has that little, what I call the Charlie Brown cloud with a little cloud of steam over

35:03.880 --> 35:05.400
their head, like they always got new cartoons.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.520
I have to just bite my lip and not say anything.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
Ow.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.360
Alright, anyway, moving on.

35:11.360 --> 35:18.720
Alright, well, other news coming out of the Microsoft press conference saying, no, this

35:18.720 --> 35:24.360
was a total shock, because this was kept under super secret wraps.

35:24.360 --> 35:32.840
Lips, their new karaoke game was announced, and they had a lot of details on that, including

35:32.840 --> 35:34.040
some pretty cool stuff.

35:34.040 --> 35:39.800
Obviously, the microphones are going to be motion sensitive, and they're wireless, as

35:39.800 --> 35:41.800
they should be.

35:41.800 --> 35:46.840
They've got kind of like this little light thing on the bottom there, I guess that responds

35:46.840 --> 35:52.360
to your voice, and they're really making this pretty much pick up and play, so if you want

35:52.360 --> 35:57.800
to join in with someone singing karaoke, all you have to do is really just shake the mic.

35:57.800 --> 36:02.120
And during the song, you can kind of tap the mic like you do in Rock Band to make a cymbal

36:02.120 --> 36:05.960
noise and stuff like that, and I hear also other people that may be in the room and stuff

36:05.960 --> 36:10.200
can pick up other controllers and hit the buttons on there and make music with that

36:10.200 --> 36:11.200
as well.

36:11.200 --> 36:14.300
So, eat that, we music.

36:14.300 --> 36:15.560
This sounds interesting.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.080
I'm down with Lips.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.000
It looks a lot like SingStar to me, but I think SingStar is kind of fun.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.780
It looks like, you know, this is Microsoft's thing.

36:22.780 --> 36:27.360
They take other people's ideas and make them better, and well, granted, it's not Microsoft

36:27.360 --> 36:31.240
themselves doing this as the Elite Beat Agents folks, but hey, I love Elite Beat Agents.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.720
It looks pretty cool.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.720
This will be a karaoke game.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.800
There is some other cool stuff about that too.

36:36.800 --> 36:41.880
They were saying that the music in this, you can actually hook up your, like an iPod or

36:41.880 --> 36:47.480
any other music player, Zoom, whatever, and it will allow you to stream any songs that

36:47.480 --> 36:50.860
you have on there, as long as they're not DRM'd.

36:50.860 --> 36:53.760
You can use just normal mp3s and stuff like that.

36:53.760 --> 36:59.880
The program actually performs like a vocal reduction on your own songs, and you can actually

36:59.880 --> 37:02.760
be scored on your own songs as well.

37:02.760 --> 37:08.240
Some other stuff that they had saying that they're not sure if they're going to allow

37:08.240 --> 37:12.940
you to stream, like say, your library if you have a PC connected on your network.

37:12.940 --> 37:14.600
You know, you can stream music usually.

37:14.600 --> 37:19.320
Not sure if they're going to allow you to do that.

37:19.320 --> 37:24.320
And also, no word if you're going to actually be able to implement your own lyrics or song

37:24.320 --> 37:26.480
chart or something like that.

37:26.480 --> 37:29.080
But they had some interesting ideas, I guess.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.380
Some of the songs confirmed for it already.

37:31.380 --> 37:40.080
They had Mercy by Duffy, Young Folk by Peter and, oh I guess, Peter, Bjorn, and Jon, and

37:40.080 --> 37:41.320
Bust A Move by Young MC.

37:41.320 --> 37:47.700
And I guess all the songs are master tracks and contain their original music videos.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.440
And rap songs work a little bit different.

37:49.440 --> 37:53.220
I guess it's not just about the rhythm in the game.

37:53.220 --> 37:55.040
So it's kind of cool they have rap and singing and all that stuff.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.640
I can't wait to rap.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.920
Hopefully we can get Loki to rap and put it on YouTube somewhere.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.480
Ahhh, no.

38:03.480 --> 38:06.760
Alright, are you excited about Lips?

38:06.760 --> 38:07.760
No.

38:07.760 --> 38:08.760
Alright.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.600
You're not a karaoke fan, right?

38:10.600 --> 38:11.600
Not really.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.600
Alright, well I'll buy it.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.600
I'll admit it.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.600
I like karaoke.

38:14.600 --> 38:18.400
I'm just hoping that it reads on my ABBA CDs correctly.

38:18.400 --> 38:20.120
Well, exactly.

38:20.120 --> 38:23.240
Because if you can put in your own music, we're having ABBA night.

38:23.240 --> 38:27.720
Well, what they should do is they should have it where you can plug in, you know, how they

38:27.720 --> 38:31.920
have the CDDB and stuff like that where you can pop in CDs and it'll, you know, detect

38:31.920 --> 38:33.880
what songs it is and stuff like that.

38:33.880 --> 38:39.240
If you could do that, say, with this game as well with MP3s, and it'll detect what song

38:39.240 --> 38:42.000
it is and automatically download the lyrics, that'd be pretty awesome.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.480
We're going to reenact the Mamma Musical, or Mamma Mia Musical right here.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.040
It'll be fun.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.080
Alright.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.080
Not on the air though.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.280
The listeners have done nothing to deserve that.

38:51.280 --> 38:56.120
Hey, more details coming out of Microsoft's camp, including that big dashboard update

38:56.120 --> 38:57.120
that's been rumored.

38:57.120 --> 39:03.640
There's going to be a huge dashboard update coming a little later this fall, and apparently

39:03.640 --> 39:06.400
some of the cool stuff that they're going to be putting in this dashboard update is

39:06.400 --> 39:08.400
Netflix integration.

39:08.400 --> 39:12.760
If you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber and a Netflix subscriber, you can now use Netflix

39:12.760 --> 39:14.280
on your Xbox 360.

39:14.280 --> 39:20.720
You can stream movies from your Netflix queue to your 360, which I think is kind of cool.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.740
The thing is though, you know, only certain movies, the ones that they allow to be streamed

39:23.740 --> 39:27.280
on the internet will do this, not in HD, sadly.

39:27.280 --> 39:33.560
It's going to be SD only for now, but they say when Netflix is ready to do HD, Microsoft's

39:33.560 --> 39:35.240
ready to bring HD home.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.420
So that's kind of interesting.

39:38.420 --> 39:42.800
The big shock and awe, avatars, oh, we didn't see anything of that coming, but yeah.

39:42.800 --> 39:46.360
The avatars, which are kind of like the Mii ripoffs, but of course, you know, they want

39:46.360 --> 39:47.600
to do a little bit better.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.280
So now not only do you have these avatars, but now you have these little like rooms that

39:51.280 --> 39:53.320
your avatars can go in.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.280
It's not like home, but it kind of is.

39:56.280 --> 40:01.120
It's not even really, I mean, because it's just like this big white room, kind of like

40:01.120 --> 40:02.440
the construct.

40:02.440 --> 40:07.480
You can still use your gamertags pictures, like if you have an Orange Laundrio gamer

40:07.480 --> 40:11.040
pic, because we actually have one on the marketplace, I don't know if you've seen it.

40:11.040 --> 40:14.380
It's in community gamer pics too, but if you have like your OLR gamer pic, you can still

40:14.380 --> 40:18.840
use it, but they are going to kind of try to get people to switch over to avatars, which

40:18.840 --> 40:20.800
yeah.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.280
Games will now be able to give you avatar unlocks.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.840
But that's not too much of a surprise when you consider games as it is, can give you

40:26.840 --> 40:27.840
gamer pics.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.740
It's just that a lot of games choose not to do it.

40:29.740 --> 40:31.040
Now I got a question for you.

40:31.040 --> 40:37.000
Do you feel ripped off at all, I mean, I know you can use your like themes with, I mean,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.840
but it's like in the background, like far background in this stuff.

40:39.840 --> 40:43.880
It's not quite as integrated as before, but do you feel ripped off for like buying say

40:43.880 --> 40:48.420
like themes or gamer pics off of Xbox Live and now they're going to switch it all over

40:48.420 --> 40:52.880
to avatars, because you know they're just going to fucking sell like clothing and shit

40:52.880 --> 40:56.120
for your avatars, and that's how they're going to make even more money off that crap.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
I agree, it's all Gaia.

40:57.120 --> 41:00.880
Eh, I haven't bought any of that stuff in a while, so I'm okay.

41:00.880 --> 41:04.080
You know, ever since the OLR gamer pic came out, I have no use for other gamer pics, and

41:04.080 --> 41:08.920
as far as themes go, not a lot of that stuff makes me actually want to go, ooh, I want

41:08.920 --> 41:12.400
to spend a dollar for that, because you can get custom themes off your PC.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.000
As long as I can still do that, I'm down.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.240
As long as I can still do that.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.240
That's special.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.840
Also, I want to point out real quick before we move on, another thing that was announced

41:20.840 --> 41:26.040
is Xbox Live Prime Time, and one specific thing that was announced is a version of One

41:26.040 --> 41:30.360
Versus 100, and this is actually something where they're going to have like a live night

41:30.360 --> 41:35.480
where you can be a part of this game show thing using your avatars, and supposedly you're

41:35.480 --> 41:39.640
going to be able to win real prizes, so you could be playing in your Xbox as one of the

41:39.640 --> 41:42.640
people in The Mob in this One Versus 100 show.

41:42.640 --> 41:43.640
That sounds fun.

41:43.640 --> 41:45.640
That's kind of interesting.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.040
It's a very casual gamer friendly thing, too.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.320
I can imagine whole families getting around to play this type of game.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.520
You know where they used to have some sort of service like that, I'm not sure if it's

41:52.520 --> 41:56.360
still around now, where you could do that with like TV shows and you'd actually be playing

41:56.360 --> 41:57.960
along with the live TV show?

41:57.960 --> 41:59.600
I don't think Game Show Network does that.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.600
Yeah.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.600
On their website.

42:01.600 --> 42:02.600
Well, not necessarily through that.

42:02.600 --> 42:05.680
This actually was like its own device or something.

42:05.680 --> 42:06.680
You know what it reminds me of?

42:06.680 --> 42:08.960
The old Berkeley Systems games on the PC.

42:08.960 --> 42:13.340
Like I don't know if you guys ever played Acrophobia or, God, there was the other game

42:13.340 --> 42:19.200
with the tower in it, and I apologize if you're hearing that noise, I don't know what's causing

42:19.200 --> 42:20.200
that.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.720
It must be, it sounds like a cell phone noise or something.

42:21.720 --> 42:22.840
That's a cell phone interacting with speakers.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.800
Okay, I don't think they got that on the show, sorry.

42:24.800 --> 42:27.320
Whoa, hello, live radio.

42:27.320 --> 42:30.720
But yeah, it reminds me of that, like that Berkeley Systems stuff back in the day.

42:30.720 --> 42:33.840
I used to love those games, those game shows, they're so much fun.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.820
So I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out on Xbox, hopefully it doesn't all

42:37.820 --> 42:42.160
crash the first night because you know that's something that is likely to happen.

42:42.160 --> 42:50.240
Well, in other news, more stuff for Xbox Live Arcade is a present for us from the people

42:50.240 --> 42:55.240
who brought us Pac-Man Championship Edition, and it's called Galaga Legions.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.640
So it's very shiny and pretty.

42:57.640 --> 43:05.280
And it's the same sort of redesigned, you know, same type of play that, you know, starting

43:05.280 --> 43:09.680
to stick with the style but trying to beef it up for the modern era.

43:09.680 --> 43:13.720
So it's shiny.

43:13.720 --> 43:14.720
That's cool.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.680
I mean, but again, it's going to be one of those things where you start to go, why did

43:16.680 --> 43:19.280
I buy the original Galaga when this is available now?

43:19.280 --> 43:24.200
Well, the original Galaga came out in the 80s and you were probably five.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.640
I know, I know, but still.

43:25.640 --> 43:29.960
I don't know, this resembles more like Geometry Wars than Galaga.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.200
It's definitely a lot more flashy.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.800
It's kind of one of those things I want to get my hands on to see how it really works.

43:34.800 --> 43:39.040
Yeah, because Pac-Man Championship Edition was only like half Pac-Man to me, you know

43:39.040 --> 43:40.040
what I mean?

43:40.040 --> 43:43.800
There was a whole different strategy to it than in the regular Pac-Man, even though at

43:43.800 --> 43:45.560
first glance it looks the same.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.840
I'm assuming Galaga will be similar, who knows?

43:47.840 --> 43:50.160
I think it's going to follow that type of suit.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.160
Yeah, most likely.

43:51.160 --> 43:52.160
Cool.

43:52.160 --> 43:57.200
Well, this week there's actually some game releases coming out, which is nice.

43:57.200 --> 44:01.400
Not a whole lot, but you know, some okay stuff I guess.

44:01.400 --> 44:08.520
And starting things off here on the DS, I know Rob is looking forward to this, Final

44:08.520 --> 44:12.280
Fantasy IV making its way out.

44:12.280 --> 44:18.160
Also on the DS this week, Azsuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns, and I know a lot of people

44:18.160 --> 44:20.200
like that one.

44:20.200 --> 44:23.840
On DS as well, and I played a little bit of this a few weeks ago, new international track

44:23.840 --> 44:26.000
and field for the DS.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.900
If you really want some frantic, I guess stylus rubbing on there, that's going to be a game

44:33.900 --> 44:34.900
for you.

44:34.900 --> 44:39.160
Now, also on PC, a bunch of smaller titles here.

44:39.160 --> 44:48.520
City Life 2008 edition, Baseball Mogul 2009, Uber Soldier 2, The End of Hitler, awesome

44:48.520 --> 44:51.520
title there.

44:51.520 --> 44:58.480
And let's see here on the DS also, Nancy Drew, Mystery of the Clue Bender Society.

44:58.480 --> 45:08.920
On the Wii, we've got Kid Sports Crazy Golf, another shovelware title from Destineer.

45:08.920 --> 45:12.960
The Mummy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor on PS2, Wii, and DS.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.880
Sadly enough, I think that's the biggest game this week.

45:15.880 --> 45:20.560
And Order Up on the Wii, yet another Cookie Mama type game.

45:20.560 --> 45:29.040
And finally, this I believe is on the Xbox Live Arcade and PS3, or PS Network.

45:29.040 --> 45:36.360
We've got 1942 Joint Strike coming out on the Arcade this week.

45:36.360 --> 45:40.800
Still sounds like a pretty busy week for releases, considering it's the week after E3, but it's

45:40.800 --> 45:42.240
summertime too.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.560
So I'm very excited about Final Fantasy IV.

45:44.560 --> 45:47.540
I was looking at the website, looking at some of the trailers that have been released this

45:47.540 --> 45:48.540
week.

45:48.540 --> 45:51.520
You know, the game's been out in Japan for a while, but I've been surprisingly staying

45:51.520 --> 45:53.980
away from a lot of the news that has come out about it.

45:53.980 --> 45:57.360
And I am quite excited to check out Final Fantasy IV on the DS.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.240
Have you seen much of it?

45:59.240 --> 46:00.240
Not really.

46:00.240 --> 46:01.840
God, they have voice acting in it.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.800
And you want to know one thing I learned from the voice acting?

46:03.800 --> 46:07.480
I always thought the main character's name was Cecil.

46:07.480 --> 46:09.840
That's what it looks like, right, Cecil?

46:09.840 --> 46:15.720
Cecil is apparently the name, if you listen to the voice acting.

46:15.720 --> 46:21.080
That makes sense, because I don't think there's a C sound in Japanese.

46:21.080 --> 46:25.080
I was just surprised a little bit, I mean, you know.

46:25.080 --> 46:27.800
All these years, I'm thinking one thing and it turns out it's the other.

46:27.800 --> 46:28.800
It's blowing your mind.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.120
It's just blowing my mind, exactly.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.480
Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the release dates that are going to be

46:33.480 --> 46:34.480
happening over there.

46:34.480 --> 46:41.200
In fact, the entire Asia region is getting a version of Wall-E on the Xbox 360 this week.

46:41.200 --> 46:45.080
But over in Japan specifically, Bully Scholarship Edition finally makes its way to Japan on

46:45.080 --> 46:49.680
July the 24th, as well as their local version of Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.560
It is the same song list, if you were wondering.

46:51.560 --> 46:53.760
It is not a J-Rock song list.

46:53.760 --> 46:58.200
If it was, I'd be importing that shit, because that would be a lot of fun, I think.

46:58.200 --> 47:05.040
Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Kung Fu Panda, as well as the PlayStation 3 eye camera pack.

47:05.040 --> 47:08.000
I guess that's some type of new eye bundle.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.660
Also, Siren, isn't that like the remake of the first Siren on PlayStation 3 or something?

47:13.660 --> 47:15.560
New translation.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.160
It's the episodic game now.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.160
So there you have it.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.640
That's coming out on the PlayStation 3.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.680
Wangen Midnight finally gets a price reduction.

47:22.680 --> 47:24.880
Good, because that game blew ass.

47:24.880 --> 47:27.880
Fucking A, I wish I hadn't bought it.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.400
Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, it's a pretty busy week over there.

47:30.400 --> 47:36.760
Kung Fu Panda, Mesaze Sori Master, Sakai ni Challenge Hen, comes out, as well as Samurai

47:36.760 --> 47:43.440
Spirits, Rokuban Shobu, and Speed Racer the video game, as well as Wario Land Shake, all

47:43.440 --> 47:45.240
come out on the Nintendo Wii this week.

47:45.240 --> 47:48.120
Samurai Spirits is Samurai Shodown.

47:48.120 --> 47:54.800
Yeah, some type of compilation package, it looks like.

47:54.800 --> 47:55.800
That's cool.

47:55.800 --> 47:59.240
Yeah, it's their version of Samurai Shodown Anthology.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
So that's pretty cool.

48:00.240 --> 48:04.240
Although, I'm surprised they wouldn't just do that for Virtual Console, because they're

48:04.240 --> 48:07.760
releasing Neo Geo games on Virtual Console now, and I guess if there are people that

48:07.760 --> 48:08.760
will buy it, they will release it.

48:08.760 --> 48:12.480
Especially if it's got all the way up through 5 and maybe the 64 versions, even though they

48:12.480 --> 48:13.480
were shitty.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.480
Gotcha.

48:14.480 --> 48:20.040
A couple price reductions on PlayStation 2, including Biohazard 4, Resident Evil, Busou

48:20.040 --> 48:25.000
Orenken, Burnout Dominator, as well, but coming out new on the PlayStation 2 this week, their

48:25.000 --> 48:31.400
own version of Bully's Scholarship Edition, as well as the Samurai Spirits Anthology collection

48:31.400 --> 48:32.800
comes out in Japan this week as well.

48:32.800 --> 48:38.000
Moving to the handhelds, the DS, you can get some new little sticky film things for your

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
DS.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.200
All for the Peanuts gang, hooray, because I guess the Peanuts are actually still really

48:42.200 --> 48:44.280
big in Japan, if I'm not mistaken.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.280
Yes.

48:45.280 --> 48:49.920
Speed Racer comes out on the DS as well, Twilight Syndrome, as well as SimCity DS gets

48:49.920 --> 48:51.640
a price reduction.

48:51.640 --> 48:54.920
Kung Fu Panda gets another release over there on the DS.

48:54.920 --> 49:01.640
And Kirarin Revolution, Mina Di Odoro, Furi Furi Debut comes out from Konami.

49:01.640 --> 49:06.560
I'm thinking it says Revolution in the title, so first you think it might be a music game,

49:06.560 --> 49:12.020
but no, it's some other type of little action game that looks cutesy.

49:12.020 --> 49:13.800
You'll know a lot else about that game, sorry.

49:13.800 --> 49:18.880
Checking out the PSP real quick, and then we'll call it a wrap for Japanese dates this

49:18.880 --> 49:19.880
week.

49:19.880 --> 49:25.760
On the PSP you get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, a price reduction, Guilty Gear

49:25.760 --> 49:32.840
Accent Core Plus, and, too bad there isn't a plushie, Infinite Loop comes out as well.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.880
Accent Core Plush would be funny, it's all stuffed animals fighting.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.360
Fighting each other, that'd be awesome.

49:37.360 --> 49:40.200
That's it for your Japanese release dates.

49:40.200 --> 49:45.200
In the UK, just a few things, on the 22nd, Yuzuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns on

49:45.200 --> 49:51.160
DS, on the 23rd, 1942 Joint Strike on Xbox 360, the same one to be out the next day on

49:51.160 --> 49:59.360
PlayStation 3, 25th, Buzzmaster Quiz, Race Driver Grid on DS, Romance of the Three Kingdoms

49:59.360 --> 50:01.600
9, I'm sorry, 11, shit.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.560
God, I remember the first one.

50:04.560 --> 50:08.400
Super Swing Golf on Wii.

50:08.400 --> 50:10.840
Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9 is on PC.

50:10.840 --> 50:11.840
Wow.

50:11.840 --> 50:12.840
Cool.

50:12.840 --> 50:13.840
Alright.

50:13.840 --> 50:22.080
Well, the next big conference that we had up during E3 was, of course, Nintendo, and

50:22.080 --> 50:27.120
one announcement that they made was that they're gonna be branching out from their normal games

50:27.120 --> 50:30.160
and bring us a sequel to Wii Sports.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.360
Awesome.

50:31.360 --> 50:36.520
Wii Sports Resort will be coming to the Wii, and it will be bundled with a brand new accessory

50:36.520 --> 50:41.680
that's called the Wii Motion Plus, and what the Wii Motion Plus will do for your Wii Remote

50:41.680 --> 50:50.120
is allow you to actually have one-one motion-sensitive capturing, so be able to detect the finite

50:50.120 --> 50:55.200
movements of your wrist and arm and et cetera, stuff that probably should have been included

50:55.200 --> 50:58.880
in the remote in the first place, but oh, we couldn't fit it in there before.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.000
But since it's a Wii Sports game, everybody will buy it, so we'll be okay.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.960
It will be coming with one of those, and all the other ones will cost you extra money.

51:06.960 --> 51:11.080
I wanna see- no, I haven't heard what the price of those were.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.080
Something was $29.99.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.240
Hopefully it wasn't the Wii Motion Plus things.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.880
I'm curious how many games in the future will require this.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.240
Probably a lot.

51:18.240 --> 51:25.100
And what's included so far, what they've announced in Wii Sports Resort is there's Disc Dog, which

51:25.100 --> 51:29.920
is like a frisbee game that you play with a little dog, as seen in-

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
Aww, that's cute.

51:30.920 --> 51:33.280
What was it, uh, Wii Fit?

51:33.280 --> 51:40.520
There is a, um, a jetski racing game, which I forget if they actually call it, um, looks

51:40.520 --> 51:46.760
kind of like, um, I guess, I don't know, a jetski racing game.

51:46.760 --> 51:47.760
It's kinda cool.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.600
Wave Race 64, maybe.

51:49.600 --> 51:53.640
And finally they had sword fighting in there as well, which people-

51:53.640 --> 51:54.640
Cool!

51:54.640 --> 51:58.160
But they made the swords look like lightsabers, sort of, so, you know, people-

51:58.160 --> 51:59.160
Oh my god, lightsabers!

51:59.160 --> 52:00.160
I gotta buy this!

52:00.160 --> 52:01.160
I gotta buy this!

52:01.160 --> 52:02.680
Everyone the Star Wars game they wanted.

52:02.680 --> 52:06.320
Except it's not really lightsabers, it's just, you know, poles.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.320
Big pole nerfsabers.

52:07.320 --> 52:10.480
Yeah, poles that look like, uh, happen to look like lightsabers.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.480
They said that there's-

52:11.480 --> 52:12.480
Nerfsabers sounds fun.

52:12.480 --> 52:16.760
There may be, um, up to ten games in this pack whenever it's released.

52:16.760 --> 52:22.780
It's not supposed to be out there until spring of next year, so, um, got some time for that.

52:22.780 --> 52:26.480
You know what's funny though, out of all the E3 predictions out there, I would think that

52:26.480 --> 52:31.000
a sequel to Wii Sports getting announced would be, like, a so frickin' obvious thing.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.480
I didn't see a lot of people predict that.

52:32.480 --> 52:33.480
Well-

52:33.480 --> 52:35.740
It's not one of those things when they announced it, I was like, oh, of course.

52:35.740 --> 52:36.740
Of course!

52:36.740 --> 52:40.600
Well, here's the thing, here's my thing, is, it makes sense for them business-wise, because

52:40.600 --> 52:44.320
you have a problem where people are picking up the Wii and all they're playing is Wii

52:44.320 --> 52:45.320
Sports.

52:45.320 --> 52:50.120
So, if they want to sell games to this market that's not really buying games, well, their

52:50.120 --> 52:54.280
best bet would be to put a sequel out for Wii Sports.

52:54.280 --> 52:58.640
I don't know, it's definitely going to be selling very well.

52:58.640 --> 53:01.720
I don't know if they're going to convince everybody that bought, you know, the Wii Sports.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.640
It would sell better if they get that crap out by Christmas.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.640
Yeah, it-

53:05.640 --> 53:07.480
I'm kind of surprised it's not.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.360
Well, I don't know.

53:09.360 --> 53:11.280
Um, it'll be interesting, I guess.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.800
I'll have to check it out when it actually comes out.

53:13.800 --> 53:19.360
Alright, another big game that Nintendo was triumphing at their press conference was Wii

53:19.360 --> 53:20.360
Music.

53:20.360 --> 53:23.720
Wii Music is that kind of that game you've seen a little bit in development slowly but

53:23.720 --> 53:24.720
surely over the years.

53:24.720 --> 53:28.720
Like, I think it started as that orchestra demo you saw at the first E3 where they showed

53:28.720 --> 53:29.720
Wii.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.720
And that game is special to me already.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.720
Years ago?

53:31.720 --> 53:32.720
Why is that?

53:32.720 --> 53:33.720
Because that's when I met Koji Kondo.

53:33.720 --> 53:34.720
Oh, okay.

53:34.720 --> 53:37.920
That's- I'm glad, Lisa, there's something special for you.

53:37.920 --> 53:42.040
I got to tell him that he was the one that inspired me to start off as a music major.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.040
Oh, nice.

53:43.040 --> 53:45.320
Even though I didn't change- even though I changed my major later.

53:45.320 --> 53:46.320
That's alright.

53:46.320 --> 53:47.320
He didn't need to know that part.

53:47.320 --> 53:51.400
Uh, but also, you know, you see- and you saw a little bit of this, I think, at the years-

53:51.400 --> 53:52.400
years future on.

53:52.400 --> 53:55.600
Well, apparently, 50 instruments are going to be included in this.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.120
You use the remote, you use the nunchuck.

53:57.120 --> 54:02.000
You can also tap your foot on the balance board to kind of simulate a drum set.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.280
Uh, apparently, you're going to have violin, guitar, marimba.

54:06.280 --> 54:09.120
I'm hoping there's a sitar in this but nothing's been said about that yet.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.120
That one is zither.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
Um.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.120
Or an autoharp.

54:12.120 --> 54:13.360
Here's what Miyamoto has said about this game.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.160
Wii Music is a slightly different play experience than you've seen with other music games.

54:17.160 --> 54:20.640
Now most music games require you to press buttons with precise timing to symbols on

54:20.640 --> 54:21.640
the screen.

54:21.640 --> 54:25.720
So we've designed Wii Music to allow everyone, including those who can't read music, to enjoy

54:25.720 --> 54:27.880
the experience of playing music.

54:27.880 --> 54:32.240
Now the interesting thing about this, like, from what I've been hearing from E3 attendees,

54:32.240 --> 54:34.120
is that this game is shit.

54:34.120 --> 54:39.280
Which is kind of sad, in a way, because it's kind of like a good concept, but it does sound

54:39.280 --> 54:40.960
like they took the game out of the game.

54:40.960 --> 54:41.960
Yeah.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.680
And now you have a noise-making device.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.680
Well here's the thing.

54:44.680 --> 54:45.680
That's basically what it's turned into.

54:45.680 --> 54:46.680
Here's the thing.

54:46.680 --> 54:50.960
Miyamoto came up on- on stage and said, who would have thought that we would have sold,

54:50.960 --> 54:54.960
you know, millions of bathroom scales, and laughed at it.

54:54.960 --> 54:55.960
You know?

54:55.960 --> 54:59.640
And he laughed at it because, like, you smug asshole.

54:59.640 --> 55:03.640
And I don't really, you know, I'm not seeing that he's laughing at, you know, the people

55:03.640 --> 55:08.840
that are buying this stuff, but in a way, you can kind of look at it like this is absolutely

55:08.840 --> 55:11.480
ridiculous that people are buying this shit.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.120
Wii Music, okay, let me put it this way.

55:13.120 --> 55:18.600
If you walk down your average toy aisle at any major retail store out there, you will

55:18.600 --> 55:24.360
find these stupid instruments that you can literally pick up and tap a button, one single

55:24.360 --> 55:26.260
button, and it will play a song.

55:26.260 --> 55:28.960
You can tap it fast, you can tap it slow.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.320
This is exactly what you'll be buying with this game.

55:31.320 --> 55:35.200
There's absolutely no way to play the song wrong because all you're doing is tapping

55:35.200 --> 55:36.720
buttons and pretending.

55:36.720 --> 55:37.720
You know what's funny though?

55:37.720 --> 55:39.200
I still think this game is going to be huge.

55:39.200 --> 55:41.560
I think there- I think there is an audience for this game.

55:41.560 --> 55:42.640
Yes, there is an audience.

55:42.640 --> 55:46.860
It's the casual market that will buy these shitty Destiny-er games that come out because

55:46.860 --> 55:50.400
they look cool and they'll drop, you know, 20 bucks on them and the games are absolute

55:50.400 --> 55:51.400
shit.

55:51.400 --> 55:56.360
Miyamoto is a genius because, you know, us hardcore gamers, at least, you know, I'm

55:56.360 --> 55:58.520
looking at this going, where's the game?

55:58.520 --> 55:59.520
Where's the game?

55:59.520 --> 56:00.520
And they're going to sell millions.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.520
Well, great.

56:01.520 --> 56:04.640
You know, I'm glad that they're going to sell millions of this because, you know,

56:04.640 --> 56:11.100
they would sell millions of a good game as well and, you know, their loyal fans who buy

56:11.100 --> 56:15.400
all these games that come out each time are kind of disappointed.

56:15.400 --> 56:20.720
I know, I was like, after watching the whole press conference from Nintendo, I'm like,

56:20.720 --> 56:21.720
that was it?

56:21.720 --> 56:22.920
That was a fucking waste of time.

56:22.920 --> 56:26.960
I have to ask Jamie because she did say, you know, she was favorable to the orchestra thing

56:26.960 --> 56:31.060
when she saw it, but hearing that they've kind of taken the game out and now you've

56:31.060 --> 56:34.320
got a music simulation device, is this still interesting to you?

56:34.320 --> 56:35.600
Yes, very much so.

56:35.600 --> 56:39.320
I'm sorry, I was a music major, I was in band.

56:39.320 --> 56:44.340
I would love to get other people together who are likewise musically inclined and see

56:44.340 --> 56:45.340
what we can do.

56:45.340 --> 56:48.680
I mean, I loved a lot of the MIDI Sims that did that.

56:48.680 --> 56:51.880
I worry, though, that this game isn't going to have that kind of depth.

56:51.880 --> 56:54.200
Like I would think, especially if you're going to get a bunch of music nerds together

56:54.200 --> 56:57.680
to do it, I would think that the game would need more depth and I worry that this game

56:57.680 --> 56:58.680
is not going to have it.

56:58.680 --> 57:01.600
I mean, prove me wrong, Nintendo, please do, but that would be my concern.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.840
They said that there's no way to play this wrong.

57:03.840 --> 57:08.680
I mean, literally all you're doing is tapping a button and it plays a song.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.840
It's just like a one button song, like you have the keyboard, so play the one button

57:11.840 --> 57:15.800
song where you can tap the key and it will just kind of play a little MIDI thing.

57:15.800 --> 57:19.560
We actually watched, I remember when we were watching them actually play this during the

57:19.560 --> 57:21.280
whole thing, it was hard to watch.

57:21.280 --> 57:24.520
They butchered the Super Mario theme on there.

57:24.520 --> 57:26.260
It was crap.

57:26.260 --> 57:27.840
It looked horrible.

57:27.840 --> 57:30.540
I would not be touching this game at all.

57:30.540 --> 57:32.480
It doesn't look fun, but you know what?

57:32.480 --> 57:36.240
Little kids and stuff that want to play music and stuff like that, it might get them interested

57:36.240 --> 57:40.240
in music, but it's going to be one of those things, just like Wii Fit, unfortunately,

57:40.240 --> 57:44.480
for a lot of people where you pick it up, you buy it, and then all of a sudden, wow,

57:44.480 --> 57:48.160
I'm not playing it anymore, and they've already got your purchase, and they've already made

57:48.160 --> 57:51.780
their money, and now they're going to be hawking you the next piece of shit thing that they're

57:51.780 --> 57:55.520
going to throw out there for the casual market.

57:55.520 --> 57:56.520
You know what?

57:56.520 --> 57:59.120
You did hit on something good, though, is that if it gets more kids interested in music,

57:59.120 --> 58:02.840
then it's a good thing, because I was a band geek in school.

58:02.840 --> 58:08.760
I would think that they would add in some sort of difficulty or control level, you know,

58:08.760 --> 58:12.720
add a little bit more freedom in what you're allowed to express with it.

58:12.720 --> 58:15.100
That was what my thought was.

58:15.100 --> 58:18.040
If there's a didgeridoo in the game, I'm sold, though.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.440
I take back everything I said to play the didgeridoo.

58:20.440 --> 58:25.160
Well, let's just, when we see a little bit more, and maybe we're lucky, and they'll be

58:25.160 --> 58:31.200
showing this off at PAX, and we'll actually get to play it, but my expectations of this

58:31.200 --> 58:36.880
game weren't that high to begin with, because it seems like they keep forcing this stuff

58:36.880 --> 58:37.880
down our throats.

58:37.880 --> 58:40.160
They were showing this off before the Wii ever came out.

58:40.160 --> 58:43.800
They showed this off last year at E3, when Miyamoto came on stage.

58:43.800 --> 58:48.080
Everyone's anticipating this game coming out, and every time I saw it, I was just like,

58:48.080 --> 58:49.560
I don't really give a crap about this.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.080
This looks stupid.

58:51.080 --> 58:55.960
And sure enough, they come out on stage during the press conference now, and yeah, it was

58:55.960 --> 58:56.960
stupid.

58:56.960 --> 59:00.400
Thank you for totally fulfilling my expectations on this piece of product.

59:00.400 --> 59:04.340
The other thing about having the one-button control is, if I'm right, you are the conductor

59:04.340 --> 59:05.920
also, right?

59:05.920 --> 59:09.260
I think they have a conductor mini-game in there.

59:09.260 --> 59:13.080
As a conductor, though, if I can understand having the one-button melody part playing

59:13.080 --> 59:17.300
as being conductor, because it is the conductor's job to signal when the next part comes in

59:17.300 --> 59:18.880
by following along with the music.

59:18.880 --> 59:24.160
So, you know, by reading the score, you have to signal to make sure that, first of all,

59:24.160 --> 59:27.120
even though the band is supposed to be keeping up with what's going on, they're supposed

59:27.120 --> 59:31.080
to know what you're doing, you still have to signal them, you still control volume,

59:31.080 --> 59:33.000
you know, keep the time.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
They're going to follow you.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.520
I would expect that that would make sense for a controller mode.

59:36.520 --> 59:39.280
I just worry it's not going to have that kind of depth.

59:39.280 --> 59:42.760
I think it's just going to be, hey, kid, waggle the thing in the air, you're a conductor,

59:42.760 --> 59:43.760
wee!

59:43.760 --> 59:47.680
I think they should have difficulty settings to allow for a broader market to play it.

59:47.680 --> 59:50.280
But there's nothing, there's no on-screen cues, there's nothing.

59:50.280 --> 59:54.040
It's literally, there's a little drum beat going along and you decide whether you want

59:54.040 --> 59:57.800
to tap your thing with the song or whatever.

59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.840
What they should have done, and this could have opened it up for the entire market instead

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.080
of just, see, that's the problem.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:06.720
They can't just develop for everybody, they just want to either develop for the casual

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.160
market or the hardcore market.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.880
They can't see past developing something that would appeal to both.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:16.880
And what they should have done is added something like Mario Paint where you could orchestrate

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.720
your own music, you know, make it where you can have four different tracks or eight different

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.960
tracks that you can record on using different instruments, and you can play different notes

01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:31.000
depending on how you had it angled and that kind of stuff, and do it that way.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.440
And then if you don't, if you're not interested in that, that's too complex for you.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.240
You can sit there and tap your finger to the music or whatever.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.120
Well, we need to move on, but I will still close with this.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.880
I don't care if the game is a piece of flaming poo, if it gets five-year-olds saying, hey,

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.760
I want to play a real marimba someday or I want to play a real, you know, saxophone,

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.200
French horn, whatever, then it's a good thing.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.200
So we'll see.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.800
I like that you said saxophone and French horn together because they have very complementary

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800
tones.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.600
I pulled instruments out of my ass that I remember from marching band.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:03.320
You know what game, though, I think they should make that would be a good music game?

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320
What's that?

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.320
You know what a theremin is?

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:07.320
No.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.960
It uses analog wave signals to play music, like it's got one that goes out vertically

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:16.480
and one that goes up horizontally, and you use your hands in between the waves.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.720
Oh, okay, I've seen that, yes.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.920
You control the music that you play.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:27.280
One of them is your volume and the other one is your pitch, and you can wiggle your fingers

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:30.940
a certain way and it'll do staccato or, you know, do it slowly.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:35.240
It'll be more flowing, but they should do a game that mimics a theremin.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.040
Wouldn't that be cool?

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.000
I got to get some comments from chat because, you know, they're commenting on it.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.260
GS68 says, I want Wii cowbell.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.440
They have the cowbell in there.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440
I'm serious.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.440
I'm getting it.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:49.440
It has a cowbell.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:54.080
Peeger Junior 92, or PK, I'm sorry, I always get the two names, PK Junior 92 says, Rob,

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.000
how would you play a didgerid thing with a Wii, because he can't spell it, a didgerid

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.160
do with a Wiimote?

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.160
I don't know.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.520
How are you going to play all this other shit with a Wiimote?

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.520
They'll make it work.

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.600
It's Nintendo.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.680
They create miracles every day.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.560
Frisbee says, but those kids aren't going to do that, Rob.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.640
I bet you're wrong.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.640
They say more people are taking guitar lessons because of Guitar Hero, trying to learn how

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.060
to play the real thing.

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.440
I know what you're thinking, Debbie Downer, but I bet you're going to be wrong.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.440
I hope you're wrong.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.080
Not to be all pessimistic or anything, but seriously, if you're really excited about

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:29.120
Wii Music and you haven't watched the conference yet, I urge you to at least watch that portion

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.840
of the Nintendo Press Conference, because you will be disappointed.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.920
I mean, it literally, it's just like, ouch.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.800
Alright, let's, new game, new Nintendo game, please.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800
Stuff.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.680
The game called, um, Nintendo Does Shit is coming out, and no, I'm kidding.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.760
And Nintendo Does Shit all over your wallet, it's amazing.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.200
No, it prints money.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:57.120
This is, though, the happy news, I think, of E3 for a lot of Nintendo fans, is Animal

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.360
Crossing City Folk, which will be, um, I mean, basically it's the same sort of graphical

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:07.880
style that we know way back in the Nintendo 64 era of Doublesu no Mori, you know, because

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.640
that was the first version that came out, was on Nintendo 64.

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.720
In other words, they added widescreen and that's it.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.560
Pretty much.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.400
But, um, the neat thing about this one is that you can use your Wii message board, um,

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.360
to send messages to your friends, and you can put on masks that look like you're me.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.360
That'd be cool.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.880
Um, especially if whoever gets goats say me.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.580
There is also a microphone option that's called Wii Speak, so you can talk to other players

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:46.120
around the world, and it's just pretty cool.

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.160
I don't know what to think about this.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.160
I'm excited.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.160
I'm gonna buy it.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160
I'm getting it.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.160
Granted, I'm getting it.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.440
I have to be able to send nasty messages to villagers everywhere.

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:58.080
I hope it's one of the things where it works a little better in theory, because the problem

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:03.040
with Animal Crossing DS, the problem with that is that there's no island.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.240
Well, not just that.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:08.000
You had to coordinate with people in order to be able to visit their village, which granted

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.920
was a step up from the GameCube one where they had to actually be at your house.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.360
But I think that's kind of why the DS one lost its charm, is they really didn't add

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.680
that much from the GameCube one, and you kind of had to do all this coordination.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:25.440
I am hoping in this one that it uses that Wii Connect 24 for a good thing where I can

01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.480
go to people's villages in the middle of the night and steal their fruit.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:36.520
Plus, I'm hearing they took the whole, like, you know how there was like a game in it?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:40.720
Is it the game, in a sense, is to pay back Tom Nook for your house, right?

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.840
I'm hearing they took that out, that there is no game now in Animal Crossing.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.160
It's just do stuff.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.880
No, no, no, they can't take that out, but I'm thinking since it says city folk, maybe

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.880
it's going to be a much broader place.

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880
I hope.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.520
Well, they say that you now can travel to a city, like a New York City style place where

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:03.120
you can get your hair done and there's all this other stuff.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.960
So you live in the suburbs?

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.960
I guess.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.240
You live in a, you know, well, it's all by train, right?

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.560
So you live in a train's away town and you can go to the big city and get all this other

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560
stuff.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.760
That is sort of very Japanese, isn't it?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760
In a way.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:21.400
It's also kind of lame, though, I mean, and I hate to put the pessimistic spin on everything,

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.640
but here's what they basically did with the city portion.

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:27.320
The city portion, remember how there was little events that would happen at specific times

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:31.240
during the week where you would have, I forget the bitch's name, they'd come and try to sell

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240
you the expensive...

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240
Sahara?

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.820
Yeah, Sahara, that she would sell you the expensive clothing.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:36.820
They had the guy…

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.840
Oh, she sold the carpets.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.400
The carpets, okay, they had the other people that sell the expensive clothing, they had

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.960
the people that would sell the rare like furniture and stuff like that.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.680
Well, guess what, now you don't have to worry about going to your town specific days, you

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.240
just go to the city and it's all there.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.720
I mean, what's the point?

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.600
I mean, the whole point is you go back to your town and actually be able to play it

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
and stuff.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.620
I think you're still going to have events that are specific to your town.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.780
There has to be, they're just going to expand on it.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.480
There's gotta be new things.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.840
What I think is they're going to, this is my vision, this is what I would do, is that

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:13.080
they would take those features that you may not, you know, that we've all gotten used

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:16.840
to, that we know on this day X person's going to be there, give them their boutiques in

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:22.080
the city, but have special festivals, have a carnival maybe, something that happens in

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.800
your town, that have very limited objects that you can maybe get like once a month or

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.800
something.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.960
You know, and it's, this wouldn't be a big surprise for me, but I honestly don't think

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:38.280
there's going to be, there will be hardly any innovation from the GameCube version,

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.040
let alone the DS version with this version.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.600
They're literally pumping out the same fucking game on every system so far.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:49.160
I did get the impression this game's kind of already in the can, that this game's just

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.400
waiting to be released already.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:55.800
And you know, it's not a bad, I mean the game's good, it's fun, and you'll play it for a while,

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.680
and then you'll get bored of it like all the other ones, but it's like they're not even

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.680
trying.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.360
It's like, okay, we put out the same game again, people will buy it, let's release it.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.400
I would like to see more things that you have to accomplish with other people.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.480
I think that would be great, like you have to do, like in order to get super rare things,

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.920
you have to work with somebody else, I mean, because it would give this whole WeSpeak thing

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.080
a use, because right now this thing is screaming gimmick.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:21.080
Maybe you have a job.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.240
Like besides just working for Tom Nook?

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:25.360
Yeah, maybe like you can be a baker.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.800
There's so much more they could do with this.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:30.360
Look at Broken Blast Works, okay, you can make custom ships in that game.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.720
You can make custom levels, custom everything.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.960
Why can't you make like custom furniture?

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.700
Have like a very basic building thing where you can like make simple geometric shapes

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.000
and put patterns on them.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.460
I mean, why can't you do that?

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.960
Gotta read comments from chat.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.360
Game Guru says a carnival was confirmed for City Folk.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.400
So that's kind of cool.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.160
Frisbee says there better be a freak show in the carnival.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.760
That would be awesome.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.040
I want to have the bearded lady move to my village.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:02.080
I want more than four characters in my village, which would be nice.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.360
I also want like say when you're not playing your characters that they walk around and

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.840
do stuff, which would be also cool.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.640
I also want to be able to put the Mii masks on the other villagers that are in there in

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.560
case I don't like their ugly face.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:16.360
Joshi16 says Animal Crossing is the new Harvest Moon.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360
I don't know.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:21.360
If you have some comments you want to have read on air, chat.orangesontrader.com when

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:25.960
we chat live on these Sunday nights at 6 o'clock pacific time at allgames.com.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:33.280
Well, something that the only thing during the Nintendo press conference that had me

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.840
excited that this conference actually might turn around was the brief announcement that

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:42.480
Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was coming to the DS.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:46.160
And that is exactly all we know about it, other than it will take place during Liberty

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:51.520
City and yeah, it's being worked on.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:57.480
No word other than that what exactly this is, but I'm excited because it's Grand Theft

01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.680
Auto.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:04.320
And then immediately the conference turned around and went back to shit again.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.760
Did they show any screens or anything from this game?

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.440
Nope, they just showed the logo and that was it.

01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.640
If I were to guess, I'd say it's either, I think it's going to be like a top down game

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:15.640
just like the original Grand Theft Auto game, but it's going to be more massive.

01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:19.360
I mean, if they do 3D, they might be able to pull it off.

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.520
I mean, they've pulled it off on the PSP, but I thought the PSP is a lot more powerful

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520
than the DS.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:25.520
We'll see.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520
I don't know.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520
All right.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:28.520
Well, moving from Nintendo to Sony.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:33.160
Sony had the last press conference of E3 this year and they announced some changes coming

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.960
to the PlayStation Network.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.840
The video delivery service is finally hitting the PlayStation Network and the cool thing

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.080
about it though versus the Xbox 360 is that you can actually get your movies on a PlayStation

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.960
3 and then move it over to the PSP.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.360
You can actually play the thing on both devices at the same time if you want.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.640
So it's kind of interesting that if you buy it on one place, you can get the portable

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.080
version as well.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:01.880
That's kind of cool and a feature that the other, since Microsoft doesn't have the handheld

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:06.880
marketplace so well and Nintendo doesn't have an internet service they could do this with,

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.480
that's kind of neat.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.680
The rumored prices right now, $2.99 for a standard definition rental, $6 for a high

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:21.000
definition download, $14.99 if you want to actually purchase the movie, no idea yet about

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.560
high definition pricing.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:26.400
Apparently the store went up right after the conference and you can get such movies as

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.440
Rambo, Cloverfield, The Bank Job, all right there.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.440
That's cool.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.440
They needed that.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:34.440
But here's a tip.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.440
Don't get Cloverfield on HD.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.960
There's no point.

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.280
They don't sell the movies in HD yet.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280
Oh, okay.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:41.280
Not yet.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.280
But soon.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.760
Soon is the all encompassing word for us, isn't it?

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:55.000
Well, and then something else regarding the Wii and what Nintendo's got released is the

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:02.920
Wii Speak microphone, which they brought up the Wii Speak with Animal Crossing, but it's

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:09.280
called a community microphone and it's supposed to sit on top of your infrared bar on top

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.400
of the TV and bring up basically everything in the room from what I understand.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.400
Hooray.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.840
So now everybody in my house can hear the obscenities people are shouting at me on the

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840
internet.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.000
Well, it's like a conference phone type of thing.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
We'll see.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
We'll see.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.920
It's an interesting departure from the traditional headset thing.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.920
I'll give them that.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920
I do like that though.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920
But I don't know.

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.120
I hate wearing headsets.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.060
It's not the device that I'm worried about.

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:36.800
It's the implementation of it.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:37.800
That's the thing.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.800
If that makes sense.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.120
At least it's not a camera.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.120
I'll give you that.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.120
I'll give you that.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.720
I don't want a camera on my Wii.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:56.080
Well also though, some other interesting news was that, especially regarding Sony, is that

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:03.360
they have released information saying that there will be a $399 80 gig PS3 available

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:10.280
in September, and labeled as the 80 gigabyte core pack.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:17.720
That actually sounds kind of neat, but it's definitely the price drop from the $499 bundle

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.720
that currently has the 80 gigabyte system.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.360
But it's not really a price drop because what they're doing is getting-

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360
It doesn't have Metal Gear.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.120
Well, it doesn't have Metal Gear.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.840
And they also basically are getting rid of the 40 gig system.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.200
Kind of think of it like the PSP, because the PSP, they have the core systems, and then

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.960
they have these entertainment bundles that they put out a fucking ton of.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:43.200
And the PS3 is getting the same thing.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.840
You're going to have the $399 core system, the 80 gig, which by the way does not play

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.240
any PlayStation 2 games at all.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.600
It has the same backwards compatibility as the 40 gig system.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.520
That's what I was about to say, actually.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:53.520
Sorry.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.200
You jumped in on what I was saying.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.960
But hey, 40 gig system with a larger hard drive, so that's awesome.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.960
I guess, though, having the 80 gig, if you're going to announce this movie thing, I mean,

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.680
I guess that's what you're going to need the space for, right?

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.480
If you're going to download all these movies, then they want you to have the bigger hard

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480
drive, right?

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.360
So in the end, they win, right?

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.880
It makes it a lot more simplified, because if they just leave it at the 80 gig system,

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:25.920
you can just do, okay, the PS3 system is $399.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.640
If you want this bundle, it's $499.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.160
But it kind of devalues the bundle a bit, I don't know.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.400
But something you may want to purchase for your 80 gig PS3 core system will be God of

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.880
War 3, which unsurprisingly was announced at Sony's press conference, and they showed

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:53.640
off a little full motion video teaser trailer, and yeah, it's God of War.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.680
Was there any actual gameplay footage?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:02.240
Not one, but it's all CGI, and it's expected sometime after this holiday season, which

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.080
could be any time.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.200
Maybe this spring at the earliest, maybe never at the latest.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:15.040
Alright, well, not only did Sony- Actually, I would probably go with the latest,

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.200
because they always seem to delay their releases of stuff.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.820
Well, not only did Sony announce the obvious, which I would say is God of War 3, but they

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.840
announced something a little bit unexpected, I think.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.480
It has to do with what's a new type of game they're calling a MAG, a Massive Action Game.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.720
You know how an MMO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game?

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.320
Well, this was supposed to be like that, but with an action game.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:44.640
Apparently 256 players- Are there that many people playing online with the PS3 right now?

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.640
Probably.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.880
The 256 players can actually all play this game at once.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:53.560
It's just apparently this giant free-for-all type game.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.240
You can get live statistics actually as you're playing.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.580
It does look like a war kind of game, and seeing as it is being developed by the folks

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:02.800
who make SOCOM, it does make sense.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.520
It's eight-player squads, is what you're in.

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.520
It's kind of interesting.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.520
Kind of interesting.

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.480
It's kind of an expansion, I guess, on the 64-player multiplayer for Resistance 2, where

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:15.280
you're in squads on that as well.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.720
I guess, though, it does kind of- You know, I said a long time ago on this show, and I'm

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.640
sure other people have too, you know, we have these massively multiplayer role-playing games.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.920
Where's our massively multiplayer other types of games?

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:26.920
And here you go.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.560
Well, they had Huxley that was supposed to be coming out at some point, but still hasn't.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.960
But I don't know.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.640
I mean, see, that's good, though, that they announced something like that, because that's

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:39.680
something that Microsoft doesn't have.

01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:42.680
That's something that can differentiate themselves.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.740
But I don't know.

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:48.920
And home is still coming, and it supposedly looks a little bit better, from what I saw

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.920
at the press conference thing.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.920
All right.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:56.000
Well, Loki's going to sum up some other E3 highlights for us, but first, I just kind

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.120
of want to go around and get everybody's highlights and lowlights from the press conferences.

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:06.040
Best announcement you heard, and worst announcement you heard, Loki?

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.320
The worst announcement I heard was the entire lineup from Nintendo.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:13.440
Seriously, that press conference was hard to watch.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.200
When I was done watching it, it was like, I want my 90 minutes back.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.240
Absolutely horrible.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.840
The best announcement?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840
I don't really know.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840
I mean, I was kind of excited about the...

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.440
There will be something that will be mentioned in the last minute stories that I think is

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:33.400
the most exciting announcement of everything.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.080
Nothing really excited me.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:36.080
Nothing really...

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:42.200
I'm very indifferent towards all of it, just because it was all stuff I expected anyway.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:48.480
The least exciting thing for me is that little motion extra device thing on the Wii, because

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:51.840
it's just now another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy, because other games are going

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.240
to have to implement this, because it probably should have been in there in the first place.

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:00.740
Most exciting thing?

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:01.740
It's hard to say.

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:05.920
As excited as I am about Final Fantasy 13 and the whole fact that I've saved money on

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.400
a PlayStation 3 with that, I think I'm going to have to get a PS3 eventually.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:16.820
So I would actually say I think the live prime time thing is one of the most...

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.640
Because it really was kind of a surprise.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.880
A genuine surprise, and something that sounds pretty exciting and different, and reminds

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.040
me of the whole Berkeley systems days.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.960
So I'm going to say that's the most exciting thing I heard in those press conferences.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.120
Loki, any other things from the big three we might have missed?

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.120
Okay.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.420
Starting off here, there was some Xbox Live Arcade announcements.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.920
Quite a few of them, actually.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.320
Some surprising stuff, too.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.920
They were of course showing off Banjo-Kazooie 3 Nuts and Bolts, while another announcement

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.000
that they made along with that is that the original Banjo-Kazooie will be coming to Xbox

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.560
Live Arcade later this year.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.820
Which is surprising, because that was an Nintendo 64 game.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.560
There was also something else that they showed off that was kind of cheesy and stupid, but

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:09.480
you're in the movies, which is an Xbox game that uses the vision camera, and will be bundled

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.240
with the vision camera when they sell it.

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:17.040
It is a game that they have you doing stupid little mini games in there, and based on the

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.760
movements that you do in those mini games, it will make a B movie for you, starring yourself

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.280
and your friends.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.520
And you can actually edit your own stuff together if you want.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:31.200
It sounds like a pretty fun party game, but very cheesy.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:39.720
Now as I alluded to before in the highlights, this is actually my favorite announcement.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:49.080
Castle Crashers, Galaga Legions, Braid, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2, all gonna

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:55.840
be out on Xbox Live Arcade within the next 4-6 weeks.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:59.440
That's fucking awesome.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:06.760
Other things, Halo Wars, supposed to be out the first half of 2009, looked kind of cool.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:16.960
There was some other stuff, let's see here, actually I want to say that August 6 is when

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:22.020
Geometry Wars 2 is going to be coming out, so that's pretty cool.

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:27.920
Not really part of the press conference, but Apogee came back, remember them?

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.560
They used to do shareware games.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.560
Yes, they were awesome.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560
But isn't that pronounced Apogee?

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.560
I think it is Apogee.

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.240
Jill of the Jungle, like what?

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:40.320
Well, they're bringing Duke Nukem to the handhelds, which made me ask, where the fuck's

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:43.360
Duke Nukem Forever, bastards?

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.280
But that was interesting.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:52.480
They showed off a Resistance Fall Man PSP game, that's due out Spring of 2009, it's

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.880
gonna be kind of like the Killzone PSP game, so that's kind of interesting.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:05.520
And this is gonna make you very happy, Rob, actually, there's, well, not really, there's

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.560
rumors that, you know, that MotionPlus controller add-on that they're gonna have, yeah, eventually

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.400
it's gonna be integrated into the Wii remote, so.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.400
Shock.

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.360
So yeah, all that money wasted for stuff that should have been there in the first place.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
Ha!

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:23.640
I just glanced at Justin.tv, I forgot about this one, did you see the Sony game Fat Princess?

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:29.640
Farmboy44 in the Justin.tv chat says that, that game looks hilarious.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:33.840
That does look funny.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.480
And then I wanna say that, I'm trying to think what else that was really cool coming out

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480
of there.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.040
I don't know, some of the gameplay stuff that they were showing off, like Resident Evil

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.560
5 looked kind of neat with the co-op and stuff that they announced that you can do there.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.840
And I don't know, the Playstation home stuff looked alright.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:00.200
The one cool thing that really impressed me though about the Playstation conference was

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:05.680
that they showed off, actually part of their presentation was done in LittleBigPlanet.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680
And it was really cool.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.520
That was cool, I saw a little bit of that, that's neat.

01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:11.560
See, that's how you make their conferences interesting, okay?

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.840
That game has me absolutely excited, can't wait to play that, October for that one at

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.840
least.

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:21.800
And I wanna say that was pretty much it.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:29.520
There was really, you know, no big game announcements as far as like DS stuff I think.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.220
I mean everyone was expecting like, I think they announced a new Pokemon Rangers game

01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:36.480
which is just whoopee doo.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.520
No Pokemon Platinum announcement, even though we know that's coming.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:45.560
But once again, Nintendo said that this E3 conference was not about the core gamer, it

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:51.920
was about casual gamers, which, okay, I guess we'll just have to wait until you announce

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:52.920
all the cool stuff.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.240
You know, get the crap out of the way, I guess.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.080
Alright, well we have plenty more to announce about E3 a little later in the show from the

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.440
other companies that weren't just the big three.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:07.000
We'll be getting into more of that in part B tonight as well as some other non-E3 news

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.320
that happened this week if you can believe it.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.960
But before we take our break and get to part B, it just would not be an episode of Orange

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.000
Lounge Radio.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.680
If we didn't take a minute to pay some respect to our elders in gaming and Dark Soccer, having

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:23.560
gone to California Extreme, I'm sure must have been inspired from hundreds of games

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.560
this week.

01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:26.240
I actually didn't see this one there though.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.240
Wow.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.240
I was a little disappointed.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:35.920
Huh, alright, so we have something completely, I guess, outside of the realm of what you

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:40.080
saw, just something you were hoping and thinking about this week, so it must be pretty darn

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:41.080
good.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.080
Let's take a look.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.080
It's the Classic Game of the Week.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.920
What should the kids be playing this week?

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:52.760
The game of the week is Kix, which is one of my all-time, all-time favorite games ever,

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.720
which became also the model for later some like, Galaxian gaming.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.720
Hell yeah!

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720
Woo!

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:03.320
But you hear the sounds, this is what you got when you played.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:08.360
It was this little vector series of lines that would move across an empty rectangular

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.960
space and you were a dot.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.960
It's like Attack of the Windows screen savers.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:23.040
And what you had to do is box in to gain a super majority of the screen, so you also

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.200
had these little spark things though that would travel on your lines that you would

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:34.480
form a box in the Kix and it would, if it hit you, it would destroy you also if the

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.920
Kix hit the line that you were drawing, it would also destroy you and you did have a

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:39.920
timer too.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:51.360
So your whole, the whole point of the game was to claim a certain percentage of the screen.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:57.600
I've actually managed to get the 95 percentile closure on the screen before just by making

01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:58.600
a trap box.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:03.280
It requires some pretty good strategy to do well.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:13.760
But there's also a fuse that will burn out part of the line.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.720
It actually will, if it makes it from one way, from one side to the other, then you'll

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.140
actually lose your life.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:28.320
But that's if you stop moving, if you start moving again the fuse will stop where it is.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.240
Also as the game got, as you progress through the game, you would actually get two Kix on

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:39.720
the screen, which you could actually easily pass the level if you could bisect the screen

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.440
so that one was on either side.

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:48.400
It really is a lot harder than it sounds, it's a very difficult game past the first

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:53.760
couple of stages, but it's one of my all time favorites, it really is.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.760
It's pretty awesome.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.280
Have you ever played Super Kix?

01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:58.100
No, I have not.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.880
They have it available on MAME, that's the only way I've played it, it's a little more

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.480
graphics in it, but kind of fun.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:11.520
The versions of Kix that I have is the Atari 5200 version and the Nintendo version of Kix.

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:17.080
And it's really so simple, and very frustrating, and I'm like, I'm going to beat these stupid

01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:18.280
lines into a circle.

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:23.320
Yeah, I remember in Super Kix you could get letters that you would actually unveil if

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.800
you siphoned off certain parts of the screen, which is kind of interesting.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.000
But in the way that this, though, has been incorporated into, like, Gals Panic is uncovering

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.040
certain portions of the screen instead of covering them with your blocks.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.280
And you get to see some boobies if you uncover the right part of the screen, like in Ms.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.160
World 96 Nude, which you know is an OLR favorite.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:47.160
Yes.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160
Alright.

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:54.000
No, but the old school Kix is pretty awesome, so, alright.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:01.920
So, one other thing, the versions that are out, by the way, is Atari 5200, Commodore

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:11.240
64, DOS, Amiga, which is graphically enhanced, Apple IIGS, Game Boy, I actually do have the

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.320
Game Boy version now that I'm thinking about it, NES and Atari Lynx.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:22.160
There was a port for the Game Boy Color that was called Kix Adventure.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:26.280
And then, I don't know if you're saying that it's on GameTab right now.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.880
And you can also find it emulated on multiple systems and get Taito Legends 2 and Taito

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:34.320
Legends Power Up on PSP.

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.520
Act Def says Kix for Xbox Live Arcade.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.600
Dude, yes.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:39.800
But you were mentioning Super Kix.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.680
And those Kix 2 tournament in 1982 and Super Kix that you were talking about, and there's

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.560
Twin Kix that was a prototype as of 1995 that never came out.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:56.760
However, there is a main release that you can play, and then there was Volfield, but

01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.560
it was Ultimate Kix Neo on PlayStation.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.660
So there's also, of course, cell phone versions.

01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:06.640
And as I was saying before, Gals Panic was also based off of Kix.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.560
It's almost a dead clone of it, except for boobs.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:21.800
Capcoma Night in Busyland, which was on SNES, Jezzball Sonics, Eric's Stix, Ultimate Kix.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.200
There's actually a mini game version in Bully.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:29.880
And Stix Reloaded, which was a freeware version, were all knockoffs of Kix.

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.760
So plenty of ways to get your Kix on.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760
Yeah.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760
All right.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.320
Well, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.440
We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.480
And if you're listening on the podcast, that means just let it keep playing, because we're

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.000
going to take a quick commercial break, and we'll be, actually, we're calling them not

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.880
commercial breaks, because they're just not paid stuff.

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.420
I want to say with that, too, well, I'll explain it at the beginning of Part B. We're accepting

01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.420
your contributions for this.

01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.060
So what's the antonym of commercial?

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.060
I'm not sure.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.060
Anti-commercial?

01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060
Public service announcement?

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.060
Anti-commercial?

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.060
Non-commercial?

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.960
They're non-commercial breaks.

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960
Yes.

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.960
They're indie commercial breaks.

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:05.960
I don't know.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:08.600
Well, commercial means pretty much something for money, right?

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.600
They're free breaks.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:10.600
Free breaks.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600
Yes.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.600
We're going to take a free break.

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.600
There we go.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.600
We're going to take a free break.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.120
Just to explain really quickly, it's probably the only time I'm going to mention that.

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:19.860
For those of you on the podcast, you will only hear our original stuff and the promos

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.080
on the free break.

01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:25.220
For those of you that are listening live tonight, you're going to hear a song or two as well,

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:28.520
because we actually need to take a stretch break, get some water and all that good stuff,

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.480
so you get a little bit longer when you're listening live.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:39.440
But we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.440
Hi.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.400
This is your buddy Rob Roberts here from Orange Lounge Radio with an important message.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:49.360
Every year, thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.720
shooting.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:56.040
Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:01.360
Health needs food badly, so please, think twice before shooting food this holiday season.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.720
The blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:09.840
that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:19.280
Remember, don't shoot food.

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:24.640
From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:30.760
Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.760
That's right.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.760
The highly anticipated sequel to the community created hit using the DDR simulation program

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:40.320
Step Media is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.720
new songs danced in.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:46.480
You'll play all new theme choruses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite

01:29:46.480 --> 01:30:06.360
Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.680
Please note there are no real songs sung by Dark Sakura because it would lead to the entire

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:13.360
Orange Lounge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a bow fire on an ocean

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:16.640
of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano, sorry.

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:28.080
You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan, John D.M.N.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:43.880
and a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.200
want you to hear.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.680
So come and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:53.520
When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplayed.com.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.680
It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while

01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:03.360
on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck, but I pooped from there, ha ha there you go.

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.520
And it's only from the Nintendo Wave.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:09.680
So come on down to your local participating Liberty City Game Store, split a work or breach,

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.480
bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:18.120
If you do, Lucky might dress up as Tana, not a guarantee.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:23.800
Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice because the

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:31.440
army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing, to get the snipers prepared psychologically

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:36.080
to be willing to kill as snipers, well except that asshole.

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:42.600
And now back to Orange Lounge Radio, there's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:47.360
of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.360
teenagers.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:56.480
Someone get the hook, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely July 20th, 2008.

01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:01.040
Jamie has a very perplexed look on her face, it looks like she swallowed a fly, I'm twitching,

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:07.560
I hope she won't die, um, you'll have to swallow a spider to catch the fly, wow, bringing us

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:11.640
back to grade school, I don't know why I swallowed a fly, we're bringing it back to grade school

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:15.120
here on Orange Lounge Radio, we're so old school, we're preschool, hey if you want your

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.160
promo or your funny PSA play, because that was all in house stuff tonight, including

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.520
the Grand Theft Auto 4 entry from a few months ago by the 100A SSJ 100 Matt, if you have

01:32:24.520 --> 01:32:28.840
some other stuff that you would like to contribute, including hey if you have a podcast, we have

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:32.280
people calling in to our program to hoard their own podcast, if you have a website,

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:37.040
as long as it is not for profit and you're a hobbyist, by all means, send us your promo,

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.880
there's more information available on Orange Lounge Radio.com, just get in touch with me,

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:42.040
we'll play it on a future show.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:47.000
If it's funny, we'll definitely play it, but if it's not funny, we'll put it in line.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:54.240
Alright, for now though, we're back to it, here on episode number 288, if I haven't lost

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:59.360
count of Orange Lounge Radio, whew, haha Rob can count, I can, I'm a winner, alright, more

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.000
news from E3 that didn't necessarily directly have to do with the press conference, Loki

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.720
start us off, um, there was an announcement, I don't know why they decided to cut this

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:12.160
because it's, I don't know, it seems kind of no-brainer to me that I would announce

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.240
this during an E3 press conference, but there was a new Halo game that they were going to

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:21.800
be announcing, but meh, we didn't have time, that was literally the excuse, we didn't have

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:33.120
time, um, could put out a, you know, written press release about it, um, I did know that,

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.280
like, I want to say the, a Walmart, they had a listing in their database for a game called

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.280
Halo Blue, whatever the hell that's supposed to be, so, is that like Pepsi Blue?

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:49.080
I hope not, because Pepsi Blue looked like Windex and probably tasted like Windex, it

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.560
kind of did taste like Windex, actually, did you ever have Pepsi Blue?

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:59.640
No, because it looked like Windex, well, this is, this is, you know, my thought, Red Bull

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:05.400
looks like pee, so I don't drink that, Pepsi Blue looked like Windex, so I wouldn't drink

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.400
that.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.800
What if a new drink, drink came out that looked like paint, would you smell it?

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.800
No.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.800
Okay, just curious.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.400
I didn't sniff paint.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.840
I think they should do a new Halo game based off of Red versus Blue, which would be fucking

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:19.840
awesome.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:24.240
There you go, alright, so, no, in all seriousness, you know, okay, so a Halo, a Halo announcement

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.400
gets pulled for time, uh, wow, what the heck, I mean, did they maybe just not have enough

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.280
to go off of, maybe this game is just way too early in development?

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.000
Are they sitting on it for PAX?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:38.180
Are they waiting for the giant orgasm that will fill the Seattle Convention Center when

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.180
that's announced?

01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:40.180
Do I smell Omega-Thon?

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:45.720
Well, I might be a little early for that, I don't know about that, uh, I don't know.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:50.720
Dude, we get to watch Omega-Thon this year, that's gonna be kind of rad, we'll have to

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:51.720
see.

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:52.720
We'll have to sign up for Omega-Thon if we can.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.120
You can't, it's randomly chosen out of people that pre-register.

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.760
Damn it, alright, that's right.

01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.400
And I, I think if we did get in as press, yeah, we probably wouldn't get to do that,

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:05.640
but if we don't get in as press, then that's disappointing.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.640
Alright.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.040
Cause even they have denied us.

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.280
Well, look, anyhow, so maybe this Halo game is just being waited on till later, but when

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:17.400
later is, who knows, maybe they'll just sit on it till next year when there's actually

01:35:17.400 --> 01:35:18.800
more game to show.

01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:22.480
Because even if they did announce it, I'm sure it's not a game coming out till 2010.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.480
We'll see.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:26.840
And the game we had no idea was coming out here at Orange Laundry Radio, this completely

01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:29.400
took me by surprise at E3, was Dead Rising for the Wii.

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:32.560
I don't know about you guys, but I was just, like, floored by this announcement.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.560
What?

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.560
Cause I've never heard of this before.

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:35.560
Dead Rising for the Wii?

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:36.560
I know.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.560
That's just insane.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:38.560
Alright.

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:43.360
That's such a unique idea to me, I've never thought of Dead Rising on the Wii.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.440
Well here's the thing, is that, you know, in all seriousness, even though, you know,

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:49.760
it has been announced as coming out for the Wii, apparently they're, I don't wanna say

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:52.720
they're dumbing it down a little bit, but they kinda are.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:57.560
Basically, the real-time missions are gonna be gone, now you're gonna have sub-missions

01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:01.640
that you beat in the game, and then you'll do a major plotline quest.

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:04.600
So now the game has become a little more linear.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.040
But some people actually think that might be a good thing, because some people thought

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.440
the 360, the way it was done there, was a little bit frustrating.

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:16.480
The camera apparently has now been changed, and now it's a behind and above type view,

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.380
more like what they had in Resident Evil 4.

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.820
So now it's kinda like one of those over-the-shoulder things.

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:26.240
And the photo mode is now gone, so you can't take, you know, the pictures, like you did

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:27.240
in the 360 one.

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:28.240
But it was kinda...

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.240
I won't miss it.

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.240
It was a little silly, anyway.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:31.240
I mean, it was fun for a minute.

01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:34.120
As long as you can still run over zombies with a lawnmower, I'm happy.

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.600
That's really all you need, I mean, to make Dead Rising.

01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:41.160
And please, God, save... or, save the save system.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.240
No, fix the save system.

01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:44.240
Please.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.360
Alright, well, Dead Rising Wii coming out soon.

01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:51.960
And by soon he means January.

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:58.480
Well, you know, and I remember Bobby actually mentioning this on his show earlier, but there's

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.440
some higher-ups that hate E3.

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.640
Hate it, hate it, hate it, the way it is.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.800
I like to consider myself one of those higher-ups, but apparently I'm the only one that does

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.800
that.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:16.160
Well, it was actually stated by the EA big guy, okay, now I'm gonna totally butcher his

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:17.160
last name.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.200
His first name is John.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.200
His...

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.200
Riccitello?

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.200
I think?

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.200
Whatever.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:27.040
Anyway, he says, he's quoted as saying, I hate E3 like this, and that they want to go

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.240
back to the old E3 or do their own private events.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.400
And the Ubisoft director, well, the Ubisoft boss said, yeah, it was terrible.

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.560
In fact, to quote him, he said, E3 this year was terrible.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:45.560
The world used to come to E3, now it's like Pipefitter's show in the basement.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:50.080
I think that the EA guy would be complaining, seeing as, well, EA was one of the four major

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:55.420
companies that approached, you know, the ESA and said, we want you to change E3 because

01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:56.820
we don't like it the way it is.

01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:58.600
They're never satisfied.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:37:59.600
They don't know what they want.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
They're like a little kid.

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:11.840
Well, there was, it actually was the Ubisoft, someone from Ubisoft named Alain Corr was

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:19.760
also, you know, saying that he didn't really care for it all that either, too.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:28.320
But one of the things that I think should be pointed out is that while they, yeah, they

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.000
were the ones that wanted it, I think they didn't expect it to turn out the way that

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:33.600
it did.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:39.680
That I think that it was such a drastic departure that they are just now beginning to see, you

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:43.800
know, to them what would be a detriment.

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:49.760
One thing that I think was pointed out by Corey is that he's kind of saying it's one

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:54.440
milestone in the communication of your products throughout the year and it's important because

01:38:54.440 --> 01:39:00.760
it's the ramp on for Christmas, but he had said that in mid-July that wouldn't be something

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.760
appropriate.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.140
Now, what I'm thinking is that if they wanted their big event, they should do something

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:07.440
closer to the end of the year.

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:16.560
You know, have E3 be your meetings and everything and then do E3 to the sequel in November or

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.560
something.

01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:19.320
Which is what E4 All was supposed to be.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.720
But people didn't see that way.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.960
It should still be the same E3, I think.

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.640
The same format as before.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.440
EA still kind of strikes me as the Goldilocks of the game industry right now.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.740
This convention is too big.

01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:34.160
This convention is too small.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.600
They're looking for a convention that's just right.

01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.760
But you know, I don't know.

01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:45.560
All that aside, I just think publishers, in part, the people that were going to E3 are

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.840
partially to blame for why E3 went in the crapper.

01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:55.200
I mean, the year Paris Hilton showed up at E3, that was the year I was like, something

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.200
ain't right.

01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:59.820
I just can't believe the people who actually wanted to go see her.

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:00.820
So blame yourself.

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:03.560
I mean, honestly, blame yourselves for ruining E3.

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:07.520
I think if they're going to bring E3 back on a big spectacle, which it seems like maybe

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:12.520
EA is going to start bullying them to do it, have some freaking responsibility with what

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.160
you decide to show at these shows.

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.680
I don't care if Paris Hilton has a cell phone game coming out.

01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.280
Keep it the fuck out of my show.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.160
I think that what they should do if they're going to have the celebrity events like that,

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:29.600
they put them in the, what was the other hall that the little games had to hang out in?

01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.600
Cancha.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.600
Yeah, they need to hang out there.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:35.960
I don't have a problem with them bringing celebrities or even non-celebrities like Paris

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.600
Hilton because you know what, that's up to the game publishers how they want to promote

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.220
their game and stuff and if they want to do that, fine.

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.340
You don't have to go see it, it's whatever.

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:49.280
I do think though that they have to figure out what the hell they're trying to actually

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.060
accomplish with E3 because the whole thing before was, it's getting crazy because there's

01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:56.280
too many people here and we can't get business done.

01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.020
Well, now that it's more intimate, are you getting business done?

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:04.400
Obviously you're not satisfied the way it is, then what exactly are you trying to accomplish?

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:09.320
I think once they figure that out, you know, maybe, I don't know, let's not take such extremes.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:14.480
Maybe we just keep it the way it used to be but I don't know, make it slightly more restrictive

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:17.480
on who gets in.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:23.240
I don't know, it's just, what they need to do is just find a happy medium.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:33.400
Alright, well, let's move on.

01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:41.360
So other EA related news is that EA formed a partnership now with id Software and of

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:48.000
course that also means that their brand new first person shooter title, Rage, is going

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:53.640
to be published by EA, so that's kind of neat.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:02.120
Some other, I wonder if that also includes Doom 4 which got teased, I don't think they

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:09.440
actually announced anything for that, hmm, interesting.

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:16.840
But yet another big company, or big developer I guess to get under their EA belt, hopefully

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.600
do something with it.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:22.560
Slowly, this big collective is being built even more and more.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.160
You will be assimilated into the big EA.

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:30.560
One thing that's not getting assimilated to EA though, because this is a Konami thing,

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:37.280
this is Gradius Rebirth, this is kind of interesting, it's almost as if Mega Man 9 was just the

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:40.760
beginning because now apparently there's this new Gradius game that's going to be coming

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.640
out for the Wii on WiiWare, I mean no news yet if it's going to come out for Xbox and

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.000
PlayStation Network as well like Mega Man 9 is supposed to be, but apparently Gradius

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.080
Rebirth is going to be coming out on the Japanese Wii systems around this summer, probably next

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.600
month or so, but it's apparently what this game is, if it's a remake of Gradius 1 or

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:03.160
if it's a new Gradius game, that quite is not known just yet.

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:06.920
The old school Gradius though is already available on the Virtual Console, so I would think this

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:11.480
is some type of new adventure maybe based on the old Gradius, but you know this is kind

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:14.680
of one of those series that people said they were kind of sad when it died, like there

01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.320
was the one, there was what, Gradius 5 on the PlayStation 2 and then it kind of disappeared,

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.320
so this is kind of neat.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.080
Jamie, I know you're a big Gradius fan, is this something you're excited about?

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.080
Anything Gradius we get.

01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:27.680
And it even has the Moai heads in it, which is pretty rad.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.880
You can't have Gradius without Moai heads.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:32.240
Absolutely, so that's going to be pretty cool.

01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:38.000
Coming out in Japan this summer and I'm imagining America soon enough.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.360
In other news, I guess sort of related to the Wii, this is actually supposed to go with

01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:51.160
my previous story about the status of E3, but Miyamoto is quoted as saying that E3 is

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:57.560
no longer where they're going to be showing off games for the core audience, and we did

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:05.040
mention this earlier in the show, but he said that, he's quoted as saying that for a very

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.800
long time E3 was an event where I guess the developers catered specifically to the core

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:15.840
gamer, so they're actually using it as something to bounce off the mass public, the casual

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.200
gamer, their new market that they're trying to get ahold of.

01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:28.040
But he said that E3 isn't the right place to point out their classics like Zelda or

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:34.160
their major titles that have been their staple, that the people really, that their fans actually

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.120
care about.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.520
I don't know about you guys, but hearing this makes me a little bit angsty because it makes

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:44.160
me think of the way E3 used to be, which was actually pretty cool, like the year before

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:45.880
Paris Hilton showed up.

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:50.360
And when I get angsty, we cue some nasty music and say some nasty things in a segment we

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.360
call the F.U. of the Week.

01:44:55.360 --> 01:45:10.280
F.U. to the woman who nearly ran into my car on Friday.

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:16.840
I was coming out of the parking lot to turn right onto the road so that I could go back

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:26.120
to work, and this woman turns directly into my car trying to pull into the entrance side

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:32.360
of this little entrance leading back onto the road, and lo and behold, the bitch was

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.800
on her phone.

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:40.560
And Julie and I rolled down the windows and said, hang up your goddamn phone.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560
And she looked confused.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:46.280
And I was like, bitch, if both of your hands had been on the wheel, you could have controlled

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.480
the wheel enough to turn it in all the way.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:52.640
It was very clear she was trying to turn the wheel with her hand and her elbow.

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:57.720
Like, bitch, your phone conversation is not worth, you know, risking my life over.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:45:59.920
Hang up your goddamn phone.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:02.520
The end.

01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:12.680
Anyways, F.U. to stupid people at movie theaters who get there either at the time of the showing

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:19.040
or five minutes prior to it and expect to find a good seat, especially when people have

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:23.000
sat down and have maybe one seat next to them and they want you to move over.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.000
You know what?

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.360
I didn't get to the movie 50 minutes early, you know, just to have some idiot come right

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:32.400
on time and tell me the move because you don't want to sit up front.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:33.400
It's a little tough.

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:34.400
You know what?

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:36.680
If I got to a movie right as it's starting, then I expect to sit in the front and you

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.680
should too.

01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:39.520
So fuck you inconsiderate bitches.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:41.920
And she was a fat cow too.

01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:45.320
She was playing with her cell phone during the movie.

01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:47.480
What is it with cell phones this week?

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:51.840
My cell, F.U. to my cell phone because I can't get opera mini to work on it anymore.

01:46:51.840 --> 01:46:52.840
So F that.

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:57.040
But my real F.U. is to having to make difficult decisions.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.400
Well, I have two difficult decisions to make in my life right now.

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:05.640
One is that my doctor is like not sure if I should have a surgery or not and leaving

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.640
it up to me.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:09.760
Like, I'm like, OK, so I get to decide if I have surgery or not.

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.680
That's kind of neat, I guess.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:15.600
So I decide I'm going to go get a second opinion because I can't make decisions by myself.

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:20.240
But the other one is that I've decided I kind of have too many hobbies going on right now.

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:23.400
So I've made a difficult decision that I'm going to be cutting one of them out.

01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.400
It's not this one.

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.400
Don't worry.

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:32.600
And it's always difficult because that kind of thing usually never gets taken well by

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:35.200
the other people you might be involved with something with.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.280
And it's going to be difficult.

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:38.640
And I haven't said anything yet.

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.600
So I don't know what I'm going to do.

01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:43.840
But you know, I think people just kind of have to understand, look, I have priorities

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.520
and sadly, you're the lowest priority now.

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:49.560
So that's what I what's a general way to break that news?

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:54.800
You think that's the best way to do it?

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:56.520
I got to do what I got to do.

01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:59.040
So it's not Warcraft either.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.040
Sorry.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.040
Oh, I was going to say.

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:02.040
No, it's not Warcraft.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.040
No, no, no.

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:04.040
All right.

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.040
It doesn't matter.

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.240
It's not the guessing game.

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:08.720
It's something.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.400
It's something big that I'm going to hate to get away from.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.800
But I have to do it for me.

01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.280
I'll tell you later.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:18.280
I don't know.

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:19.280
I couldn't read your lips.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.280
All right.

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.280
All right.

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.280
So that's it for the FUs of the Week.

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:25.360
Other people are quitting WoW.

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:26.360
I'm not.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.360
I still love WoW.

01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:28.360
WoW's great.

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.360
But I don't play it every day anymore.

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.960
I play it once in a while.

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:36.160
Apparently somebody out there was actually listening to me, or at least thought the same

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:39.280
thing when I saw the movie Wanted.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:42.680
They are bringing a Wanted game out to the market.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.680
Universal and Grin are working on a Wanted game.

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:52.080
And it will allow you to do all the fun stuff like curbing bullets and going into assassin

01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.840
time as they call it.

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:58.320
Only sad thing though is it's coming out on Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360.

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.400
I was really hoping for a Wii Wanted game because I really think that would be cool.

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.640
Especially with the new Motion Plus.

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.840
Now you can attach that to the bottom of your Nyko Perfect Shot and curve the bullets that

01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:09.840
way.

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:10.840
But whatever.

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.240
This will be cool though.

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:14.240
Worth checking out.

01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:18.240
Hopefully it will be out around the time when the DVD comes out which is holiday maybe.

01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:24.680
But if we're just seeing it now and it hasn't been developed for a while, it could be crap.

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:26.680
It scares me.

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:31.080
Alright, well one thing I get to look forward to in World of Warcraft since I didn't leave

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:34.400
it is that I'll be getting my own achievements in Warcraft soon.

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.400
That's right.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400
You know what?

01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:38.840
If Microsoft has put out this achievement thing it's a pretty good thing.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.360
Other people are going to start stealing things from Microsoft and Blizzard is one of them.

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:43.360
And it's kind of a neat idea.

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.360
They're going to be doing this achievement system and in the game apparently there's

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.880
going to be PVP achievements, PvE achievements, achievements for exploring the world, achievements

01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:58.320
for crafting, achievements for questing and developing your character, I mean all these

01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.320
different things.

01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:01.800
But what I like is that some of the achievements are silly.

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:06.940
There's an achievement that you can unlock for giving 10 hugs to other players.

01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:11.820
So if you're just a hug slut you get an achievement for that which is kind of funny I think.

01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:16.660
Apparently there are really, really, really difficult achievements as well called feats

01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.120
of strength.

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:19.260
So interesting.

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:22.760
I'm assuming this is all going to be able to be tracked on Blizzard's website and the

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:27.980
armory and all that fun stuff too but my question is what about all the stuff I've already done?

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:31.880
Is WoW going to be capable of knowing that I've done all this stuff on my current level

01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.880
70?

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.880
Because that's going to suck if I have to start with a whole new character.

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.680
Well that's how they're doing the PlayStation trophies is even if you've done this crap

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.040
it's not going to be able to know based on your save game you have to go back and actually

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.040
do it again.

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:43.040
Right, right.

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.880
You know other websites have, was I going to say Newgrounds kind of does something similar

01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.760
with their flash games.

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:52.760
Actually all the flash games have kind of trophies built into it and stuff.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:58.520
So that's kind of neat that they do that too and you know I think WoW doing it, it's a

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:02.160
great idea especially if they do it right and hopefully some of these other publishers

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:07.960
out there that are making Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games take note of this and actually do

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:12.100
the achievements correct instead of just beat level one, beat level two.

01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:16.120
Make them fun, make them different.

01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.560
Alrighty, very cool.

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:27.300
Well something else that's fairly cool and this actually has to do with Silent Hill Homecoming.

01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:34.080
They were actually showing that there will be our good buddy with the Red Pyramid hanging

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:41.740
out in part of Silent Hill Homecoming and that it's going to have a PC version.

01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:45.280
So that's pretty cool.

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.380
Just like I guess the ones before it except for the very first one.

01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:50.040
But that's pretty cool information.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.960
I mean he would have to be, because I mean my whole problem with having Pyramid Head

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.900
in the movie even as cool as it was, was that he was supposed to be like a part of the main

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:05.720
character psychosis and I doubt that she has anything about the lady in the movie had anything

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:08.480
about sadomasochism so I don't know.

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:14.360
But maybe this guy does, the main protagonist of Silent Hill Homecoming, Alex Shepard.

01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.040
I was actually going to ask you about that.

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:23.520
Are you going to forgive it for kind of maybe bending the lore in Silent Hill to give the

01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:26.760
fanservice of having Red Pyramid, Pyramid Head, whatever in the game?

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:31.720
We did have some reoccurring critters, you know, certain same types of things.

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:32.720
Like the nurses.

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:33.720
The nurses.

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.720
Yeah, the nurses.

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:40.560
But I mean I think that maybe it's just that if they're going to do it this way then I

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.440
think that maybe that's just how the town manifests that certain feeling or something,

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.520
that certain part of someone's psyche.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:49.080
As long as he rapes things.

01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:55.320
We got Pyramid Head, for those who don't know, he goes around having his way with the female

01:52:55.320 --> 01:53:02.440
creatures of the town of Silent Hill, including the double-sided mannequins and the nurses,

01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:06.560
and then he goes around stabbing random women who keep regenerating.

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.480
I need to watch the Silent Hill movie again.

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:09.480
God, it was great.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:10.720
Come over to my house, we'll watch it.

01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:12.040
Seriously, I want to watch it on Blu-ray.

01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.040
I bet it's pretty.

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.040
I need to get it.

01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:15.040
You don't have it on Blu-ray.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.040
No, I want it.

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.040
And my husband's a butthole.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:19.040
He did it on Blu-ray, maybe he still has it.

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.360
Didn't we watch it on Blu-ray once?

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.920
I mean, I love my husband very much, he's not always a butthole.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.800
We did it at your apartment, your old apartment.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.120
I don't think we watched the whole thing.

01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:27.120
Yeah.

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:28.120
You can bring it over.

01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.820
But I've got, like, the humongoly TV.

01:53:30.820 --> 01:53:33.720
We need Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Night.

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.840
Okay.

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:36.840
Maybe that should be a holiday.

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:37.840
I hear the rabbit-

01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:39.960
An official holiday on Orange Mounds Radio.

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:40.960
I hear the Creepy-

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:46.360
Was it the Creepy Rabbits from number two, I think, or back at school?

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.020
We have to also have nurses, we have to have nurses.

01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.240
And I want the screaming things.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:56.000
I would ask the chat room, what day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.800
Not Halloween, that's too obvious, some other day.

01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:02.320
What day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:03.320
So we'll see.

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:04.320
Tuesday.

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.320
September 12th.

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:06.320
Why is that?

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.320
I don't know.

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:08.320
The day after your birthday?

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:12.320
Well, you could do it, how would the release date of Silent Hill Homecoming-

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.320
Oh, there you go.

01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:14.320
Or the day before.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:15.760
What was the day that Silent Hill 2 came out?

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.700
I don't know, I'll have to look that up.

01:54:17.700 --> 01:54:19.480
That should be Pyramid Head-

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.600
I will look that up and we will dub that Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:25.400
I will look that up right now while we get into another story.

01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:26.400
Awesome.

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:31.040
Well, this is kind of weird and it may not actually be a confirmation at all, but apparently

01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:37.960
there is some people that performed some sort of social engineering prank that had 2K games

01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:45.080
support believing that there is a hacked version of Grand Theft Auto IV's PC version, at least

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.760
a demo of it, on a pirate site.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:54.400
And apparently there was some back and forth going on with the tech support to which they

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:59.560
replied with, the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV has not even been announced for release

01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:08.480
and is still in development, so it's not about to be released on a website.

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:11.480
People are reading into that thinking, well it's still in development, well that kind

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:14.000
of confirms that it's actually coming out.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:20.400
But the whole thing is does really their tech support know anything about games in development?

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:21.400
I don't know.

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:22.400
Maybe.

01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:26.960
I mean, I would think it would be kind of dumb if they didn't put out a PC version.

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:35.240
And I know the last few PlayStation 2 games have been on PC, so why not?

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:37.560
So maybe it's coming, just might take some time.

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.940
Alright, and I'm sure that makes a lot of people very happy, especially because PC means

01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:43.440
easily hackable.

01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.440
Exactly.

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:45.440
It means mod crazy.

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.440
Mod crazy.

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.440
Alright, here we go.

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:48.440
Here's the answer to the question.

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440
We did the research.

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.680
The Silent Hill 2 was released in North America.

01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:53.360
Believe it or not, North America got it first.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.280
Japan got it three days later.

01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:57.840
September 24th, 2001.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.640
Too bad it's not the 23rd.

01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:00.640
You know, it's funny.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:07.320
September 24th, I think, is very close, if not the exact release date of Homecoming.

01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:08.320
Interesting.

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.080
Well, there you have it.

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.080
So I guess that's it.

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.080
So do we officially...

01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:16.160
No, September 24th is a Wednesday this year, so it might be like September 23rd, or that

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:18.040
might be the day you actually can get it in a store.

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:21.360
If it's the 23rd, then we have the number of consequence.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.560
24th can be a release date.

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:25.080
Games mostly come out on Wednesdays.

01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.080
Alright, fair enough.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:27.080
It's like a street date.

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.240
I mean, they have a ship date, but you know.

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.240
Whatever.

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:31.240
I think we...

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:32.240
But we have the official word.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.040
September 24th is Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:36.040
Official.

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:37.040
Done.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:38.040
Done deal.

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.040
Get the wax.

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.320
Let's get the seal, the OLR seal.

01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:44.120
That's in our new universe of Orange Loungia.

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.120
Alright.

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:46.120
So...

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:50.120
I like that, Orange Loungia.

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.960
How should people celebrate Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day?

01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:58.980
You can't tell them to rape things, because unfortunately, rape is not funny.

01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:03.280
You can just have them put on a big cardboard pyramid on their head, and walk around with

01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:06.600
like, since it's really hard to find a great knife like that, walk around with a plastic

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:07.600
knife.

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.640
Walk around the neighborhood and threaten the cats.

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:10.640
In your neighborhood.

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.640
You have to have a plastic knife.

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:12.920
You have to have a plastic knife.

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.160
And take pictures.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.360
Bake Pyramid Head cakes.

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.360
Yes!

01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.360
Bake Pyramid Head cakes.

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.320
Pyramid Head cupcakes, and pass them out to the neighbors, and they have to be red velvet.

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:23.320
Alright.

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:25.880
So we want pictures of you celebrating Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:26.880
And the best...

01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:27.880
This year.

01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:28.880
The best cupcake wins.

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.880
Something.

01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.200
Wins eaten by the hosts.

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.200
You know what would be awesome?

01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:36.200
What?

01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:37.200
If we had a lot of money.

01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:38.200
I mean, a lot, a lot of money.

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:39.200
What?

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:42.960
We'd love to have the cakes to build you a sculpture of Pyramid Head as a cake.

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.960
Great.

01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:45.440
I have a friend that makes wedding cakes.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:46.440
I'll have to see.

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:47.680
That wouldn't be too bad.

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.400
Sharan in chat says, can I wear my pyramid shaped tin foil hat instead?

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.400
You certainly can.

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.400
But we want pictures.

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.400
Celebrate in whatever way possible.

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.400
I like that.

01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:56.960
Pyramid shaped cupcakes.

01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:57.960
You could do that.

01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:00.040
I mean, just kind of take a cupcake and kind of either...

01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.040
Tin foil.

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.040
You know.

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.040
You can make your own mold.

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:04.040
But no, seriously, contest.

01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:06.040
Dun dun dun.

01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.040
And the rules are...

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:08.040
Just a ways out.

01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:10.800
The rules are whatever we decide they are at the time.

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:15.480
One of them is a costume contest for your best, not necessarily cosplay, but just your

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:17.360
best celebration of Pyramid Head.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.880
And the second one is how pretty your cupcakes are.

01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:20.880
I don't know if they'll have...

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:21.880
I don't know if Pyramid...

01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:22.880
Send us pictures.

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:25.440
Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day is that PC.

01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.440
I mean...

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.440
Who cares?

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:30.640
I think some people, maybe rape victims might be offended by that.

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.640
You know?

01:58:31.640 --> 01:58:32.640
Yeah.

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:33.640
I know.

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:34.640
We might be offending some people.

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.640
Okay.

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:36.640
It's just Red Pyramid Day.

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:37.640
Or Pyramid Head Appreciation Day would be fine.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:38.640
It's funny.

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:39.640
Rape of people is not funny.

01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:40.640
No.

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:41.640
Rape of monsters...

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:42.640
Is.

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:43.640
Funny.

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:44.640
Because monsters are bad.

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:45.640
And when bad people...

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:46.640
Bob.

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:47.640
What?

01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:48.640
I'm just not gonna keep going.

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:49.640
Let go of the shovel.

01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.640
I'm gonna...

01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:51.640
Yeah.

01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:52.640
I'm digging myself a hole.

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:53.640
Okay.

01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:54.640
How about...

01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:55.640
What?

01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:56.640
Pyramid Head Day.

01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:57.640
I still like Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.

01:58:57.640 --> 01:58:58.640
But only when you rape monsters.

01:58:58.640 --> 01:58:59.640
How about the Rape Appreciation Event?

01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:00.640
You know what they should do?

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.640
We should have a rape carnival.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.640
That'd be cool.

01:59:03.640 --> 01:59:08.640
Is the mold your own custom, like... or... I can see the hate mail coming from a mile

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.640
away.

01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:14.440
We should mold our, like, custom, like, gummy candy, like, molds and make, like, gummy red

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:15.440
pyramid heads.

01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:16.440
We need your ideas of how to...

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.760
We're gonna make pyramid cakes.

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:21.840
We need your ideas of how to turn this into a politically correct event.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:22.840
There's no way, Rob.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:23.840
All right.

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:31.320
Um, Shaoran says, uh, I'm offended some of my best friends are monsters, you asshole.

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:35.160
And no, Joshi16, there will not be a rape-a-thon this part of the day.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.160
This is horrible.

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.160
No, no, no.

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.160
No, it's gonna be...

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.760
It's gonna be Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.760
All right.

01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:42.920
Yeah, we'll figure something out.

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:43.920
Okay.

01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:47.560
Anyhow, in a completely different topic, I'm sure there'll be a lot of appreciation for

01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:48.560
this as well.

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:53.080
It has been announced that BioWare and LucasArts, they are building the MMO for Knights of the

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.080
Old Republic.

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.520
Now, this is different from the existing Star Wars MMO, but there is that new Knights of

01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:00.200
the Old Republic MMO that's gonna be going on.

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:07.040
It's pretty cool, and you can see this whole thing that's post, I guess it's on portfolio.com,

02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.200
and it has been confirmed.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:11.320
This is Knights of the Round, I'm sorry, Knights of the Round Republic.

02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:12.600
That would be awesome.

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:14.520
Knights of the Round, the old Capcom game.

02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:17.280
Knights of the Old Republic is online.

02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:19.000
It's Knights of the Old Old Republic.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.600
Shut up.

02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:24.400
I cannot think of KOTOR without thinking of my friend who tested it and what they called

02:00:24.400 --> 02:00:25.400
it in office.

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:26.400
What's that?

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:27.400
Scrotor.

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:28.400
Nice.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.400
Very nice.

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:31.680
So, there you have it.

02:00:31.680 --> 02:00:33.400
That game will be coming probably in a couple years.

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:36.040
It's probably still a little ways out, but I'm sure there's lots of people that are waiting

02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.240
to ditch WoW for that.

02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:38.840
It'll be good times.

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:39.840
Alright.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:44.680
Anyhow, we're gonna get into another segment here on Orange Launch Radio that's good times,

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:46.520
because it's the chance for us to hear from the listeners.

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.240
It's the mailbag segment.

02:00:48.240 --> 02:00:53.120
Every week we invite your emails at mailbagorangelaunchradio.com, and let's read some of those emails right

02:00:53.120 --> 02:01:00.800
now.

02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:01.800
Emails!

02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:02.800
We have some.

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:03.800
The end.

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:04.800
Wait, can I jump in here?

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800
Because there's a great idea from us if we're in chat.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800
Well.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.800
Pyramid Hat Appreciation Day.

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:12.040
The day that people across the world wear pyramid hats and rip skin off their fried

02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:15.440
chicken.

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.960
So it's ripping skin off chicks?

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:20.280
Yeah, but it's chicken.

02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.680
So that way it's politically correct.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:26.080
Well, I think we're- I think ossifers set a good, like, starting point.

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:28.160
I think there's a good idea in there somewhere.

02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:29.160
Anyway.

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.160
Sorry.

02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:31.160
Mail.

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:32.160
Yeah.

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.160
Um.

02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:34.160
From Robwith2bees.

02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:38.920
A dear two guys, a girl, and an Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salad and breadsticks.

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:41.880
Is it me, or is the news from E3 much more boring this year?

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:47.920
One of the things that was, um, new, we moats shouldn't add on that more accurately judges

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:50.160
the controller's aspect.

02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.680
Can this more or less throw out to your old plastic thingies?

02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:58.480
Um, it won't fit onto the zapper, so maybe you won't need it for older games, but there

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:00.200
will have to be a new zapper.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:03.720
Are two zappers truly better than one?

02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:05.720
No.

02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:10.920
Or you can buy the Nyko Perfect Shot and then slap it into the pass-through in the bottom.

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:14.480
Not that both games will probably be using the thing at the same time.

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.920
Or you could just save yourself the money and not buy a zapper because they're shit.

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.720
I actually don't agree that E3 was necessarily disappointing.

02:02:21.720 --> 02:02:22.720
I think especially at my-

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:24.120
I think boring was the word.

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:27.160
I think at Microsoft's camp, I think they did just fine.

02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:30.600
I mean, you knew that nobody was going to be announcing a new system this year, and

02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.440
I think the only thing that made Microsoft's press conference a little bit, um, we knew

02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:36.800
that was coming was because of the leak that had already happened.

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.120
I think if you hadn't known about the avatars in advance, uh, I think it would have been

02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:43.040
a pretty big deal to see that new dashboard for the first time.

02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.040
Um.

02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:47.160
And even still, we didn't know that the new dashboard was coming, we just knew that avatars

02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:48.160
are coming.

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:52.760
And the other thing, too, is I like the format of the new E3, um, you know, with all the

02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.000
press conferences because it's very much like gamer's days, and I think it's a lot easier

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.840
to digest the information, unless of course you're, you know, doing Capcom's press conference

02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:06.560
where all they did was talk about the fucking, you know, Lost Planet movie, but, you know,

02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.440
no information out of that.

02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.440
Um.

02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:16.640
But I like the old show, no, show floor of the original E3, so if we can kind of do both,

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.640
that'd be awesome.

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:18.640
We'll see.

02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:23.720
Well, you notice that when we went to press events, um, our last year of going, they were

02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:29.400
sort of off in those little rooms, where they had the little trailer area set up inside

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.920
the, uh, the show floor.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:34.520
I loved it, though, when we got to go to Bethesda's thing, that was great.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.480
I loved Bethesda's area, and they were so nice.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:38.160
It was just because it was just chill.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.600
And I really actually liked, um, Play and See.

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:41.600
Yeah.

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:42.600
I really liked it.

02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.560
Everybody that let us in, I think, I just, yeah, I just distinctly remember Bethesda

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.840
because they had a lot of stuff I was kind of interested in at the time.

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.840
Um, but.

02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.040
Call of Cthulhu.

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:51.040
Where's that?

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:54.840
It just, I think any company, you know, even at the old E3, you know, kind of getting off

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:58.360
the main floor into those little back rooms and stuff was, was kind of neat.

02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.600
Call of Cthulhu came out in 2005 on the Xbox.

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:03.280
I completely missed it.

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:06.000
Well, I don't think anyone missed it.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:09.960
I remember being so excited, and then I never heard anything about it, so.

02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:16.920
Well, to make it up, there is a new Call of, or a new Cthulhu movie coming out that stars

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:17.920
Tori Spelling.

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.520
Unfortunately not as Cthulhu, but, you know.

02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:24.520
And she has a small part.

02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.040
Oh, okay, so she's just a cameo.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.040
Maybe she dies really well.

02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.040
Anyway.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.040
Maybe she's a Cthulhu, I don't know.

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.040
Cthulhu.

02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:42.480
Anyway, Uber email, really long, and this comes from GS191.

02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:45.480
And it's really long.

02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:47.320
Read the first two paragraphs or something.

02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:49.080
Um, well, it's really long.

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:53.280
Um, hello there, it's been a while since I've written anything to you all.

02:04:53.280 --> 02:04:56.640
Nevertheless, I am still an avid listener of the show, even though I haven't been able

02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:58.560
to be in the chat room in quite a while.

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:02.000
You can blame my World of Warcraft guild and them pushing me to level my Gnome Mage to

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.720
70 so they can get another crowd controller in the group.

02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:05.720
Go figure.

02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:11.280
Anyway, after sitting through all the big three E3 press conferences, piss conferences,

02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:14.280
I do have some choice words about all of them.

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:18.880
By the way, I have to give many grats to G4 for showing all of the E3 press conferences

02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:21.040
for the big three with no commercials.

02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:27.160
I must say, it was quite nice to see them on a 50 inch plasma TV, but standard definition

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.400
for the lose.

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:30.400
To be honest, it would be better just to stream them.

02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:35.680
I heard that they cut away for the Final Fantasy 13 announcement to show the audience, instead

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:39.760
of, you know, viewing the wonderful trailer for Final Fantasy 13.

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:42.640
They actually had to, because there was a little thing that came up on the screen, I

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:45.440
don't know if you saw it, it got leaked out somewhere, there was a little thing on the

02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:48.340
screen that said, please do not videotape the following trailer.

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:49.340
So I think they had to.

02:05:49.340 --> 02:05:50.340
You may not...

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:51.600
Yep, there is video footage of it.

02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:55.520
That was, well that was Square's thing, not G4's probably.

02:05:55.520 --> 02:06:05.880
Well, just in general, from what I'm seeing about the Microsoft one, is that, I guess

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:11.720
he seems pretty happy about Fallout 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, saying

02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:15.920
that they did a good job showing it and being excited about Final Fantasy 13.

02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:23.880
I'm actually going to post this email also in our forum, so I'll put a link to it in

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:24.920
the chatroom later on.

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.240
But it's a fairly lengthy email, but I think it makes some very, very good points.

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:36.200
And of course, Sony's having their demo of Resistance 2 and LittleBigPlanet demo and

02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:37.200
that type of stuff.

02:06:37.200 --> 02:06:44.520
So I'm going to be actually posting this in its entirety on the forum, so, in a minute.

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:45.520
Awesome.

02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:46.520
It is really long.

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:51.440
Hey, Ossofer's building on the idea, you want to hear the, now this could be for the Pyramid

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:53.120
Head Carnival, okay?

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:58.800
Opening events for the Pyramid Head Appreciation Day, Spin the Pyramid, Silent Hillopoly, Sorry,

02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:03.600
You Got Raped, and Twisted Pyramid, Twister but in more compromised positions.

02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.880
I do, though, have to read the closure to his letter.

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:07.880
What's that?

02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:12.040
It's from MichaelGS191, this email is brought to you by the never-ending disappointment

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:15.460
that is Nintendo, where's my fucking Star Fox remake for the Wii?

02:07:15.460 --> 02:07:18.920
Or F-Zero, get in line.

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.820
Well, continuing on, shall I?

02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:22.820
You shall.

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:25.160
Another email adventures.

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:26.680
This is actually from Sauce.

02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:29.440
Hey guys, gals, and ferrets.

02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:32.080
Wait, wait, wait, where's the ferret?

02:07:32.080 --> 02:07:33.080
The question, where's the ferret?

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:35.400
You had the ferret earlier, you were- The ferret was snuggling in my boobs.

02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:36.400
I see.

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:38.800
Is that how you lost it?

02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:41.760
No, I was actually sitting on it.

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:46.040
I come bearing another video game review to add to the OLR collection, this time the game

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:48.680
of choice's God of War, Chains of Olympus.

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:52.400
I'm including a link to the review for the chat room's reading pleasure, which I will

02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:54.320
link in the chat room momentarily.

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:58.360
The short version of the review is that Chains of Olympus is a fun, non-stop, action-packed

02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:03.260
game worth playing for any God of War fan, or any fan of hack and slash violence.

02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:06.120
It has excellent graphics and sound, and is definitely worth the play.

02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:11.480
Anyone interested in keeping up with my video game reviews or articles about comics and

02:08:11.480 --> 02:08:15.960
movies, as are the three industries, are very much tied into one another, can follow me

02:08:15.960 --> 02:08:20.580
on Twitter, under Marin Marvel, for updates.

02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:24.400
Keep up the good job, OLR, maybe someday Skye and I will rock the boat and you'll see the

02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.760
reviews on the OLR website, winky face.

02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:27.760
Someday.

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.760
Sincerely, Marin.

02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:31.240
I'm gonna link it in the chat room in just a sec.

02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:33.480
Yes, I need to read it still.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:34.480
I'm kind of curious.

02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:38.000
I'm curious to hear what she thinks of it, because I don't know if she's a huge God of

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.120
War fan, so I'm kind of curious what she thinks of the PSP one.

02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:42.840
So we'll see.

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:46.000
The chat room has now been officially linked.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:47.580
Dun dun dun.

02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:49.520
So last email.

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:50.520
Which came very last minute.

02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:55.560
Also, Rob2b sent me other emails, but I'm going to save those for being related to last

02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:56.560
minute story stuff.

02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:58.120
They're pretty cool things.

02:08:58.120 --> 02:08:59.600
Hey, OLR.

02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:01.960
I got the orange box for PS3 a couple of days ago.

02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:04.600
I can't believe I waited so long for such a great game.

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:07.540
Even though I haven't played the original Half-Life, the story is still pretty easy

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:08.540
to follow.

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:09.540
Excuse me.

02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:13.560
And it's kind of fun to guess what happened before, plus it looks amazing.

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:17.920
Portal also made me smile at the sly remarks, but I have to say, playing the Flash game

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:21.680
first makes the first bunch of levels much easier.

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:23.920
If anyone hasn't picked it up yet, do so immediately.

02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:30.200
Preferably not now, but maybe tomorrow during AGI, since you won't miss the whole show.

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:34.360
Miss a whole lot in the 20 minutes it takes to get it.

02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:39.360
I'm listening to this show right now, and I hope that- let me start over- I hope I can

02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:41.000
get Skype to work this time.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:42.800
Anyway, I look forward to the show.

02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:43.880
Thanks for reading this email.

02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:48.040
If you don't read this email, then I guess there's no point in me thanking you, so if

02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:50.120
you don't, no thanks.

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:52.500
Sincerely, pkgr92.

02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:56.160
This email is sponsored by everything and everyone else not yet mentioned, so now if

02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:00.280
you sign your emails, you'll be pirating my right to beat that.

02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:02.760
Alrighty then.

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:03.760
It's dot com.

02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:05.760
Is that it?

02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:06.760
Yes.

02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:08.560
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:10.320
Email us some stuff.

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:13.460
Try to not make it so epic though, because then we'd have- you know, we don't have time

02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:15.320
to read it on air, so we have to post it in the forums.

02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.920
Not that that's a bad thing, but you know, keep it concise.

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:23.040
We like concise emails.

02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:25.600
Moving on with some gaming news, right Logie?

02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:26.600
Yes.

02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:28.200
Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.500
There's been some more details unveiled about the game, including that it will have 20 plus

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:36.880
characters and download content as well.

02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:42.920
Of course, they didn't really say too much else other than they were going to be kind

02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:46.880
of splitting up the roster with, you know, DC and Mortal Kombat characters.

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:53.040
There's also fatalities or brutalities, I guess, for the villains that are going to

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:54.680
be in it.

02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:59.360
So if you're playing as DC villains, you can kill people, but the DC heroes will not be

02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:00.360
able to kill people.

02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:03.200
They'll just only maim.

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:04.200
I think.

02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:05.200
No.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:06.320
It depends which Batman we're getting.

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.080
Adam West's Batman never really killed anyone.

02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:09.320
Wonder Woman killed someone.

02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:11.080
With their bare hands.

02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:15.440
Actually, I do believe that Adam West should be in this game.

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:18.000
That would sell it for me, but.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.560
Oh well.

02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:21.240
Adam West's Batman should totally be in this game.

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:24.200
Either way, I can expect this game in November.

02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:25.360
Cool.

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:32.240
Well, Harmonix has given us a few details, this E3, about the Rock Band 1 compatibility

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.520
in Rock Band 2.

02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.960
Of course, Rock Band 2 is a game that caught a lot of people's attention at E3 this year,

02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:40.960
and it's already kind of sneaking out there.

02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:44.160
They showed the game at some side parties that were held and things, which sounds kind

02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.160
of cool.

02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:47.280
And one of the rumors out there was that you were going to be able to have all your Rock

02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.960
Band 1 tracks in Rock Band 2, and it turns out, true statement.

02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.760
Apparently what happens is that you're not going to be able to transfer all the songs,

02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:01.520
because apparently there's some licensing things going on.

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.360
They basically have to re-license every song in Rock Band 1 for Rock Band 2.

02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:09.960
They are saying, though, it's only supposed to be a couple songs that don't come over.

02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:15.080
And some people are thinking perhaps the Aerosmith song can't come over because of the whole

02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:17.880
fact that Guitar Hero owns their soul now.

02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:21.000
But hopefully only a couple songs miss the boat.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.080
Apparently though, you are going to have to pay a small fee, maybe like a $5 fee, to transfer

02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:26.080
the songs over.

02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:30.880
But I still think it's kind of neat, because man, if you add 60 songs from Rock Band 1

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.380
or however many they end up having, and then your download tracks and the Rock Band 2,

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:37.560
that's a lot of freaking songs.

02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:41.640
Seriously, a lot of freaking songs.

02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:45.160
So there you have it.

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:50.200
Rock Band 2 songs and Rock Band 1 songs together in one roof.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.200
Amazing.

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:52.720
That's how they should be doing it.

02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:58.840
Well, in other news, there is a date out for Play TV, something that's going to record

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:02.300
your TV shows while you're gaming.

02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:08.720
It's coming out in Europe from September to December, the first release date being the

02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:11.080
10th of September for the UK.

02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:17.760
It's a DVR that adds on to the PlayStation 3, so you can use it while you're playing

02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:23.280
something that you just happen to really be into to record whatever show that happens

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:30.040
to be coming on while you're busy killing people in your game.

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:35.840
Kudos for them for making an add-on for the PS3, but isn't that just a VCR?

02:13:35.840 --> 02:13:36.840
I mean...

02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:37.840
It's TiVo.

02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:40.820
But you can still record, I mean, if you're playing a video game, you can still record

02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:45.140
stuff on your TV, you just have it record off of a different channel.

02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:49.120
It's just like, remember how with the old VCR, you could watch one show while you're

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:50.120
recording another?

02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:51.120
I don't know.

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:52.120
It's just...

02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:53.120
Well, hey.

02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:54.120
It's TiVo.

02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:56.320
If it fills your need, I guess, you know.

02:13:56.320 --> 02:14:03.160
We've also got release dates for Australia and New Zealand around February or January.

02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:04.160
So...

02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:05.160
Okay.

02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:06.160
Anyways...

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:09.360
We're having fun network issues in-house again.

02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:10.360
Fun fun!

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:13.680
Live listeners are noticing that Justin TV went down again, and I think we're just gonna

02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:15.440
pull the plug on that for the night.

02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:16.440
Bye-bye.

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:21.600
Sorry, but we don't know how else to fix our network issues, and usually JTV is the first

02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:22.600
thing that has to go.

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:23.600
Sorry.

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:24.600
Because really, do you really want to watch people just talking?

02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:25.600
I know.

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:30.760
I guess people like Justin TV because there's not as much lag, and that they can hear the

02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:33.840
things that go on during the break time, and that...

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.480
I guess the sound's better, but I don't believe that.

02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:38.760
The sound's crystal clear on all games, so I don't get that.

02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.080
Well, my network just came back up, so...

02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:42.080
Yeah.

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.080
So, just kill Justin TV for the night.

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:44.080
Sorry, guys.

02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:45.080
Alrighty.

02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:50.000
Now it's fun naked time, so, haha, you missed out, Justin TV.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:53.680
Anyways, I'm taking my pants off right now.

02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:57.480
First, going wild!

02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:04.800
So Guitar Hero On Tour, surprise, is getting a sequel called On Tour Decades.

02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:11.040
And I guess the first game sold just over a third of a million, with 350,000 units sold

02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:18.640
in three weeks, and the sequel, no word on exactly when it's coming out.

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:22.820
There is rumors, though, that there might be some form of microphone functionality,

02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:26.000
maybe karaoke.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.160
I don't know.

02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:30.440
No word, though, when it's coming out, so...

02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:34.320
Big surprise, a DS sequel, or a sequel for a Guitar Hero game.

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:38.780
I mean, hey, they wouldn't want to leave, you know, the DS out with 50 billion releases

02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:39.780
each year.

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:40.780
Who knew?

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:41.780
Never.

02:15:41.780 --> 02:15:45.800
Alright, well, one more story for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:52.080
for you guys, a 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, and, look, we

02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:56.040
saved the best E3 announcement for last.

02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:57.040
Here's the thing.

02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:02.320
A new game was announced by Ubisoft at E3, and the game, Jamie, you're gonna be very

02:16:02.320 --> 02:16:03.360
excited about this game.

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:06.680
You know what, all those network woes, you're not even gonna think about that because you're

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:08.560
gonna be so excited about this game.

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.960
It's called Baby's Party.

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:17.240
It's basically Imagine Baby's the party game.

02:16:17.240 --> 02:16:22.240
It's coming out this autumn, and apparently you actually use the balance board in the

02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:23.240
game.

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:27.880
You actually play this at a babysitting academy, and there's 30 minigames in the game.

02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:33.620
It's head-to-head, co-op mode, both games, or both methods are available, and it's based

02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:36.600
on the typical day of a baby.

02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:37.600
I don't...

02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:38.600
What?

02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:39.600
Eat, sleep, poop, cry?

02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:43.880
I know, I can't think of 30 things that a baby actually does in a day, but there you

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:44.880
have it.

02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:45.880
What was the old...

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.880
Baby fart?

02:16:46.880 --> 02:16:47.880
Can they blow up?

02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:51.720
No, the babies can't even really fart by themselves, like the burping...

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.800
They can burp, they just need help.

02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:59.600
What was the game they used to have at Milpitas Golf Land, with the big buttons that was like

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:00.920
the babies racing?

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:06.560
Oh, they had that at the game, the convention too.

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:07.560
It was...

02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.560
The hell was that?

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:09.560
Bye Bye Baby...

02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:10.560
No.

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:11.560
Bye Bye Baby something?

02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:12.960
Yeah, it was some like baby racing game.

02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:14.960
Come on baby, says AJ Mixx.

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:15.960
Come on baby, yeah.

02:17:15.960 --> 02:17:16.960
Here you go.

02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.960
That game was awesome.

02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.680
If you want to give us a call and talk about how you can't wait for Imagine Baby's the

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:29.840
party game, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, I just like

02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:37.000
the reaffirmation we got from our chat room with Josie16 saying, they sure can poop, as

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
if we didn't know.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.240
Thanks for the clarification, appreciate that.

02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:46.400
AnimeSatsuma in chat says, I can't wait for the breastfeeding minigame.

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:47.400
Me neither.

02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:51.360
Anyhow, we've got a caller on Skype, hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:54.120
Hi, this is Gia68.

02:17:54.120 --> 02:17:56.120
Hi Gia68, how are you?

02:17:56.120 --> 02:17:57.120
Alright.

02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:02.120
Hey, you got to go to California Extreme and you met Jamie live and in person, right?

02:18:02.120 --> 02:18:03.120
Yep.

02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:07.080
Now, I've asked you this because I've always wondered this myself, what's Jamie like in

02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:10.880
real life off the air?

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:16.080
Last time, I kind of didn't recognize her at first, because last time I saw her was

02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:20.520
at Fanta Mae and she had, I think, magenta-ish hair, I don't remember.

02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:30.200
Yeah, my hair was black in front and red in back, but this time my hair was all black.

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:38.640
Also Jamie, when you're speaking in person, you sound a little younger than you do right

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:39.640
now on the air.

02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:40.640
Okay.

02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:41.640
Okay.

02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:42.640
I think the radio makes our voices base-ier.

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:43.640
Yeah.

02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:44.640
It just, yeah.

02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:47.640
Well, didn't Travis say I used to sound like a hyperactive 13-year-old?

02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:50.200
Yes, but then you went through puberty.

02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:51.200
That was many years ago.

02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:54.200
You just dab-robbed with a face.

02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:55.200
Microphones.

02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:58.920
Alright, look, in all seriousness, how was, how was California Extreme?

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:02.000
It was pretty cool.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:06.800
Alright then, what games did you enjoy playing, like, were there some classic games you'd

02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.720
not really paid respect to before that caught your eyes?

02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:16.560
Let's see, there were a bunch of, most of the games I played were games that I already

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:23.960
played or, and I was familiar with, or I hadn't played in a while, like, the old Star Wars

02:19:23.960 --> 02:19:29.520
arcade game or Tron, at least the games I hadn't really played before, like, Tailgunner

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.520
and Looping.

02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:35.480
Dude, they had the old Star Wars game there.

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:36.480
That game was awesome.

02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:39.680
I got it for sale on top of it, the sit-down cabinet.

02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:41.760
They had like three of those machines there.

02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.720
I could fit a Star Wars cabinet in here, how much they want for it?

02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:46.720
I want to say, what, was it 500?

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:48.480
Wow, was it in decent shape?

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:50.800
Fairly, I didn't play it, I played Cinestar though.

02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:54.840
Oh my god, I want to sit down Cinestar.

02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:58.240
Dude, I want an arcade machine in my garage, wouldn't that be awesome?

02:19:58.240 --> 02:19:59.240
Rob!

02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.240
What?

02:20:00.240 --> 02:20:01.240
Build a maim.

02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:03.480
But I want like a, I want a real one.

02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:04.720
It's real!

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:05.720
You can touch it!

02:20:05.720 --> 02:20:06.720
Alright, alright.

02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:07.720
We'll see, we'll see.

02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:09.520
If you set it on fire, it'll burn.

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:10.520
We'll see.

02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:12.840
I don't think my roommate would like that idea very much.

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.160
I know my wife didn't.

02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:18.640
Yeah, except I'm not married to the roommate, it's more of a business arrangement, it's

02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:19.640
a little different.

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:20.640
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:23.200
I like to think of my marriage that way too.

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:25.800
Originally, that's all marriage was, was a business agreement.

02:20:25.800 --> 02:20:29.160
Look, GS68, is there anything, we're getting on tangents, is there anything else you want

02:20:29.160 --> 02:20:31.160
to add about your wonderful weekend?

02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:38.960
Um, yeah, I, mostly I was playing The Grid, which is like this third-person shooter.

02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:41.200
I know The Grid, The Grid is awesome!

02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:47.640
Yeah, and Rush 2049, which was that racing game of horror that before Wonka and Maxie.

02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:50.360
Did they ever bring The Grid out on home consoles?

02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:52.240
I think it's on regular Playstation, isn't it?

02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:53.400
No, I don't think it is.

02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:55.400
Wow, that's kind of weird.

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:56.400
Interesting.

02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:00.440
Alright, well, GS68, any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we take another call?

02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:04.240
Nintendo did not address resource space at E3.

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:05.880
Epic fucking fail.

02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:06.880
Agreed.

02:21:06.880 --> 02:21:09.440
I'm very disappointed they didn't address it.

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:14.840
I hold out hope that maybe since folks at Nintendo feel that this is not where they're

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:19.400
going to be addressing the hardcore gamers anymore, my hopes are at PAX, our questions

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:23.120
will be answered because I can't think of what other show is for the hardcore gamers

02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:25.400
except maybe Tokyo Game Show.

02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:28.520
Thank you for stealing my words, Tokyo Game Show would be the other one.

02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:32.320
Yeah, they don't display at Tokyo Game Show though, normally Nintendo's not there.

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:33.320
Yeah, but they do something concurrent.

02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:34.520
They do their Nintendo World crap.

02:21:34.520 --> 02:21:36.640
Yeah, they do that thing concurrently.

02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:40.120
It's pretty much the same thing.

02:21:40.120 --> 02:21:44.760
On all our endgame fads, I haven't my sake estimated since I'm not removing it until

02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:48.880
Nintendo addresses resource space.

02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:50.600
I think it's very unfortunate they didn't.

02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:57.040
I mean, that little speaker system is kind of whatever, just roll out a freaking patch

02:21:57.040 --> 02:21:58.920
that supports the SD cards.

02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:01.360
Do it overnight while we're sleeping, you know?

02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:02.360
Just do it.

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:03.360
Yeah, whatever happens.

02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:09.640
I mean, PS2 did it, the original Xbox did it, why can't a console that's one generation

02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:10.640
ahead?

02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:13.520
Oh, but it's the new generation, not the next generation.

02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:17.400
But you have to understand, they announced stuff that's been out on other systems forever

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:20.680
and act like it's the new, newest thing ever.

02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:25.920
Like, oh my god, it's voice chat over the internet, and woo, this has never been done

02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:27.240
a billion times before.

02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:28.840
Oh, but wait, it's different.

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:33.240
It's a community voice chat because it's a giant, you know, microphone thing instead

02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:38.640
of headsets because we couldn't figure out how to do headsets, so we made a big USB microphone,

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:39.640
surprise.

02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:44.640
You know, I wish I could use my own USB microphone on that because, to be honest, I don't know.

02:22:44.640 --> 02:22:47.960
I don't want to have to, I don't want to buy anything.

02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:51.040
Alright, just to see, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:52.320
Have a good one, buddy.

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.320
See ya.

02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:56.560
This is Golden7GameOLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:59.240
If you want to give us a call, we are standing by.

02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:00.240
Operators are standing by.

02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:05.100
I don't think we're going to do too many calls tonight because thanks to all of our frickin'

02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:09.200
network issues we've been having, among other things, it's kind of put us a little behind

02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:12.600
on time, so I think we're going to get out of here a decent hour tonight, so we'll see

02:23:12.600 --> 02:23:13.600
what happens.

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:14.600
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:15.600
Who's this?

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:16.600
Hi, this is Gold Banjo.

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:19.920
Hey, Gold Banjo, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:23.960
I'm really pissed that they didn't have the F-Zero Wii and Star Fox Wii.

02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:24.960
Amen to F-Zero.

02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:26.760
Yeah, Star Fox Wii I'm okay with.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:31.120
Star Fox seems to be the game that comes out really late in the, uh, because I just remember

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:34.920
that Star Fox GameCube thing, that adventures or whatever the hell that thing was, that

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:35.920
didn't come out until-

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:36.920
I never got around to that.

02:23:36.920 --> 02:23:37.920
That, well, you didn't miss much.

02:23:37.920 --> 02:23:40.440
It didn't come out until really late in the GameCube cycle.

02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:45.240
Star Fox will be the thing that we get a couple years down the road, but F-Zero, man, maybe

02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:49.880
it's just because Mario Kart is still out there, so they want Mario Kart to be the racing

02:23:49.880 --> 02:23:53.600
thing for a little while, but I really hope that next year's E3 we get something about

02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:54.600
F-Zero.

02:23:54.600 --> 02:23:56.600
Yeah, me too.

02:23:56.600 --> 02:24:00.880
We'll see, but I'm just, you know, I'm a big F-Zero fan, you know, what can I say?

02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:04.440
I wouldn't mind watching somebody else kind of pick that up, you know, Wipeout's kind

02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:05.440
of cool.

02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:07.560
I guess Wipeout's the closest thing I can think of on another system that's kind of

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:11.820
like F-Zero, but it's not the same, but I love that futuristic fast racing.

02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:14.160
That's my favorite, is the future fast.

02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.160
Speed Racer.

02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:16.160
Really?

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:17.160
I'm gonna have to check that out.

02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:18.240
You should check it out.

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:19.240
It's actually pretty cool.

02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:20.240
Do you own it?

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.240
Uh, yes.

02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:22.640
I'm gonna borrow it.

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:23.640
You can't borrow it.

02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:24.640
Oh, okay, I get it.

02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:25.640
I get it.

02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:26.640
Funny.

02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:28.640
All right, what else is on your mind, GoldBander?

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:30.640
What else, what do you think of the other stuff?

02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:39.320
Well, this week I finally, I'm actually starting to get into some PC gaming, I was playing

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:45.360
a bunch of the Source Engine games from Steam and stuff, Valve, like Half-Life, Portal,

02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:51.600
and I was having some fun with that, I guess, so that was a blast.

02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:55.600
There's some fun stuff on Steam, if you haven't seen it yet, check out Audiosurf, I like that

02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:56.600
one on Steam.

02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:01.360
I played the demo and I really liked it, I'm thinking about it.

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:04.640
I wish there was some more multiplayer type stuff you could do in there, but it's still

02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:05.640
fun.

02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:11.320
It reminds me of Klax on speed, that's what I love, I used to love Klax back in the day.

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:18.520
I got my butt with the first online journey onto the online thing, there's always going

02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:26.960
to be that, the little kid that likes to swear and be rude, and the kid's like speaking some

02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:34.000
other language and stuff, and then once we start to try and vote ban him, then he apologizes

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:40.560
and speaks English, so I'm like, now you can speak English, and it just got me so mad and

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:46.000
stuff, and then he's like swearing not to ban him, we just ban him, no questions, no

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.000
further things.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Good for you.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:53.080
I have a zero tolerance policy for idiots on those things, and on Xbox Live I warn them

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:56.920
every time, I do the little feedback thing every time.

02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:01.320
I'm a little jerk on Xbox Live, I'm a tattletale, but you know what?

02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:03.040
Somebody's got to do it.

02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.120
Exactly.

02:26:05.120 --> 02:26:06.120
It's just annoying.

02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:09.600
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Go Banjo?

02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:17.680
Let me think, I don't know, you three could have been better, but I am excited for Banjo

02:26:17.680 --> 02:26:23.720
Kazooie 3, I don't care what anybody else says, I'm a hardcore Banjo Kazooie fan.

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:26.880
We haven't had a lot of Banjo Kazooie love on the show tonight, so there you have it.

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:30.960
Go Banjo, adding a little bit of Banjo Kazooie love, so it's not just a clever name, Banjo

02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:31.960
Kazooie.

02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:34.080
Alright, have a good night, my friend, take care.

02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:35.080
Okay, later.

02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:40.240
I was going to say too, real quick, if you are interested in a game that's sort of like

02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:44.280
F-Zero, try the Speed Racer Wii game.

02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.640
It just dropped in price, it's only $29.99 now, and you probably can get it used for

02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:48.640
even cheaper.

02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:50.720
I still need to play the pinball game I got on Wii.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:53.520
I've played a little bit of it, and it's fun, I need to play more of it, because pinball

02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:55.720
is awesome, right, Jamie?

02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:57.160
Yes, it is.

02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:01.320
Or if you don't own a Wii, you can get it on the PS2 coming in September.

02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:04.760
Aw, Shaoran in chat called me a fucking narc.

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:06.880
The narc was an awesome game, so shut up.

02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:12.120
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:13.400
Bow down to Pyramid Head.

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:14.720
No, this is Osprey.

02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:16.720
Hey, what's up, Osprey?

02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:19.000
That'd be cool if Pyramid Head did call us.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.640
I feel like I'm the only one that was kind of excited for a new Zelda game to be announced,

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:26.920
and it was never announced, so I'm sad.

02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:31.320
I didn't have my hopes up for it, it did seem a little bit soon in the Zelda cycle.

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:33.000
Next year, definitely.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.400
Next year, definitely, definitely.

02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:36.000
This year, not so much.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:39.280
Didn't we just get a DS game not that long ago?

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:41.720
The whole little Wind Waker looking thing?

02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:42.720
That was just last year, right?

02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:43.720
Yeah.

02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:44.720
It was a fan of my hourglass.

02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:47.720
It was, I don't know, it was okay.

02:27:47.720 --> 02:27:51.520
You have to remember, Nintendo's developing for two major platforms now, it's not just

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:56.480
about the Wii, it's about the DS as well, so you know, they're a little split there,

02:27:56.480 --> 02:28:03.240
but I think you'll see a new Zelda, you know, Uber-type looking game next year, probably.

02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:08.440
I was more surprised, that Kid Icarus thing, with all the evidence that supported its existence,

02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:10.720
I'm very surprised that it didn't show up.

02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:11.720
Very surprised.

02:28:11.720 --> 02:28:16.800
Well, you know that they're just trying to appeal to the casual gamer now, so I guess

02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:20.280
we're not even going to hear about that at E3 anymore.

02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:21.280
Maybe E for All?

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:24.080
I don't know, isn't E for All supposed to have the big three this year?

02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:27.240
E for All usually has them all, but they don't make any announcements there.

02:28:27.240 --> 02:28:31.960
If anything, it's going to be around Tokyo Game Show, or whatever their game world thing

02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:32.960
is.

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:36.320
I think they still have time to announce some more titles for, because really they only

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:43.440
have Animal Crossing, which I think, I thought that was November 7th-ish, it might actually

02:28:43.440 --> 02:28:48.400
be in October, it's around October, November, and then that's pretty much it for the holiday.

02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:52.840
I mean, that's all they've announced so far for Wii, so that's their one title.

02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:55.860
They have room for some more titles to get slipped in there, because usually they have

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:57.760
a title coming out each month.

02:28:57.760 --> 02:29:02.800
Last year was Donkey Kong Barrel Blast for September.

02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:06.640
There was Battalion Wars 2 for October.

02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:13.800
And then for November was, of course, the Wii Zapper and Super Mario Galaxy.

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:19.180
I don't think there was anything for December, January was something.

02:29:19.180 --> 02:29:22.400
But they have room to announce some more games in there, and I don't think they're going

02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:27.680
to have one game for the holiday, unless they manage to get the Wii Sports Resort thing

02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:28.680
out.

02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:32.280
So, I expect some more announcements.

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:37.160
So some hopefulness from Loki that makes sense, makes sense to me, he's right, there's got

02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:39.640
to be more than one game coming out this Christmas.

02:29:39.640 --> 02:29:45.400
Alright, any other thoughts, Osfer?

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:49.920
I'm kind of concerned about the future for DDR, seeing as that they want to add mines

02:29:49.920 --> 02:29:53.960
or shock arrows, as they call it, into it.

02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:58.400
At least they're trying something new for them, but you're right, I don't think it's

02:29:58.400 --> 02:30:02.840
going to give the game the swift kick in the pants it needs, but it's something I guess

02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:04.280
to hold people over.

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:09.240
Well, I don't want DDR to turn into ITG, because that's like one of the main reasons I hate

02:30:09.240 --> 02:30:10.240
in the group.

02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:13.960
It's because I hate mines, like, you play the game to step on the arrows, not to freaking

02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:14.960
dodge them.

02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:15.960
It's just irritating.

02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:19.320
If, hey, as long as they have maybe, you know, you can turn freeze arrows off, so I'm sure

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:23.660
you can turn those things off too, but I get what you mean, you kind of hope that they

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:26.320
don't whore it out, you know what I mean?

02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:31.480
Yeah, and also, even if you can turn it off, like in the group, it kicks you from being

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:36.200
able to rank in any of the songs, so, I don't know.

02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:37.200
Interesting.

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:38.200
Well, we'll see.

02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:41.800
I am curious about that new machine, though, when everyone comes to our neighborhood.

02:30:41.800 --> 02:30:44.040
Hopefully it doesn't get broken by little kids first, we'll see.

02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:49.200
I forgot to mention, I played Guitar Freaks V4 this week.

02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:52.160
I have to say I'm very unimpressed by it.

02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:56.800
It's just, I don't know, the whole interface and everything looks like a really shoddy

02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:03.600
PlayStation 2 game, which, actually, I think the releases of Guitar Freaks are on PlayStation

02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:07.120
2, so I guess that makes sense, but no innovation whatsoever.

02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:11.920
Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, we're gonna wrap up the show, but have a good

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:12.920
one, okay?

02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:17.120
Alright, see ya, I'm calling for the night.

02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:18.120
Later.

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:20.800
Alright, we're gonna close the Skyplane for now.

02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:24.880
If you didn't get through, I'm so sorry, but you can always leave us a voicemail, or, and

02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.700
I gotta catch up on voicemails, probably next week we'll do that, or you can always send

02:31:27.700 --> 02:31:30.840
us an email, mailbagorangeonstrader.com, let's do some last-minute stories.

02:31:30.840 --> 02:31:32.240
Jamie, you said you had a couple.

02:31:32.240 --> 02:31:36.240
Uh, actually, I do, and one of them, because I couldn't get the email pulled back up, I

02:31:36.240 --> 02:31:41.720
found it from another site, but this one was given to me by Rob2Bees.

02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:49.640
Time Hollow, which is a Konami game for the DS, is to be localized and released in August.

02:31:49.640 --> 02:31:53.880
It's actually, the neat thing about the game is that you get this thing called a time pen,

02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:58.440
which is your stylus, that you use to manipulate time to solve puzzles within the game.

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:05.080
It's very, uh, almost sort of, uh, Phoenix Wright-ish, in terms of how, uh, how it feels

02:32:05.080 --> 02:32:10.040
or how it plays, but you can check, uh, either the, um, the Japanese website for it, which

02:32:10.040 --> 02:32:16.960
is, uh, konami.jp slash time underscore hollow, or, um, I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube.

02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:21.600
And the other thing that's, um, I know a few other, uh, anime fans would be excited about

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:27.600
this is that Sega grabbed the license for, um, the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, um,

02:32:27.600 --> 02:32:34.160
for Nintendo DS, um, actually several of the, the DS games, um, from, uh, Namco Bandai and

02:32:34.160 --> 02:32:40.440
Sega's like, um, okay, we want, so, um, you might see those eventually, and you can also

02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:42.720
get the, the little happy dance that she does.

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:48.640
I want the PlayStation 2 one, because in the PlayStation 2 one, she apparently makes her

02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:51.200
own RPG, and then you get to play it.

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:52.200
Cool.

02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:53.200
So.

02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:54.200
Very cool.

02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:55.200
Okay.

02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.200
Loki, anything?

02:32:56.200 --> 02:33:01.320
Of course I have stuff, I have a long laundry list of stuff.

02:33:01.320 --> 02:33:03.320
Make it quick, we want to go home.

02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:08.420
Um, anyways, Ubisoft announced a game called I Am Alive, it's like a survival game, looks

02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:15.040
pretty cool, coming out Spring 2009, and, uh, yeah, I have an awesome trailer for that.

02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:19.400
Rock Band 2, they announced the full track list for the game, which is pretty awesome,

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:25.960
including, uh, there's ACDC, AFI, Las Morcet, um, Alice in Chains, Bad Company, Beastie

02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:31.240
Boys, Billy Idol, um, there is Journey, uh, any way you want it.

02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:33.720
Pretty much one of those rumored lists came true, it seems like.

02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:35.840
Yes, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, et cetera, et cetera.

02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:36.840
Fleetwood Mac, awesome.

02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:42.640
Um, but there is 84 songs that they detailed, and I hear there's going to be 20 more tracks

02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:46.720
as well, but they're going to be free downloads, so, that's kind of cool.

02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:47.720
That's cool.

02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:54.880
Um, also, um, there's some stuff, there is a no fail option as well for Rock Band 2,

02:33:54.880 --> 02:34:00.480
or what I like to call it, Drunk Party Option, so that's pretty cool.

02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:08.860
And um, some, um, kind of a change of pace here, but apparently, the, um, Rock Band instruments

02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:13.120
will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour.

02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:17.200
So you'll actually be able to use them, uh, what they're going to do, since Guitar Hero

02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.920
World Tour has, you know, five things you can hit instead of, um, you know, the four,

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:27.320
they're going to actually, um, automatically disable one of those when you play that, um,

02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.440
so that's kind of cool.

02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:35.760
Also, the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, um, is being patched to utilize

02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:40.960
the Rock Band, um, guitars on the 360, so that's kind of cool as well.

02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:43.400
Good, good move, thank you.

02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:49.520
Um, apparently NCAA Football 09 is really broken, uh, there you have a laundry list

02:34:49.520 --> 02:34:54.640
of stuff that's just not working, including some sliders, like the CPU sliders, and don't

02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:01.400
do anything, uh, the online dynasty mode's broken, the super sim mode is broken, and

02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:06.360
the kick returns are also broken, and some other crap, so, way to go EA Sports also,

02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:08.800
um, I want to say NASCAR 09.

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:11.400
The game saves are broken, sweet.

02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:19.080
Um, one thing that's kind of interesting is, um, apparently Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had, uh,

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:25.800
been patched, there was a, um, disk check thing being added into the game, um, but it

02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:31.760
was a problem for people that got the game via digital download, and so the fix for it,

02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:38.400
well, apparently Ubisoft used a pirate hack that someone had made to bypass the disk check

02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:39.400
thing.

02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:40.400
What?

02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:41.400
Nice.

02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:42.400
So they, um, used that to fix it.

02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:43.400
Huh.

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:44.400
Interesting.

02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:52.520
Um, also, the NPD results for, um, June have come out, and the Wii is now the number one

02:35:52.520 --> 02:35:59.360
selling system in the US, as well as the world now, so, 10.9 million units with the, um,

02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:06.160
Xbox 360 trailing behind by just a little bit, so, very interesting.

02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:12.240
Um, Nintendo Power has announced a, um, new game via their cover here, uh, what we thought

02:36:12.240 --> 02:36:18.400
may have been Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually Sonic and the Black Knight, um, which is,

02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:24.920
looks like a role-playing game, maybe a little bit Kingdom Hearts-esque, I don't know, um,

02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:28.400
there's also rumors that Nintendo might actually be publishing that title, so that's-

02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:30.200
Sonic and Mario World, that would be awesome.

02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:32.240
So that'd be kind of interesting there.

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:39.920
Um, Miyamoto, um, announced that they're making a Pikmin game, so, that's kind of cool, um,

02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:45.240
and one other Nintendo game that kind of went under the radar here, Rhythm Heaven is, has

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:51.000
been announced for the US, it's actually, um, Rhythm Tengoku Gold is being localized

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:57.000
for North America and, of course, is a rhythm music game, uh, Samba de Amigo, uh, Sega has

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:03.160
confirmed that it will be getting downloaded, and, um, it's actually going to debut some

02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:10.680
launch content, um, starting on September, uh, 23rd when the game is launched, and, uh,

02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:15.200
the first set of downloads will include the 80s, um, radio song, I guess, I Want Candy

02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:23.160
from, uh, Bow Wow Wow, or Bow Wow Wow Wow, yeah, we get it, too many, uh, Jets, um, Are

02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:30.440
You Going to Be My Girl, and Lou Bega's Mambo Mambo, and no word if those are paid to unlock,

02:37:30.440 --> 02:37:36.400
um, content, or if it's actually download content, but interesting, nonetheless, and,

02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:44.760
um, let's see here, there was a new unlock code for Supernova 2 cabinets that, uh, revealed

02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:52.200
three more songs, uh, Terra Stars, and, um, let's see, Jet Girl Spins, uh, Mars Wars 3,

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:59.600
and Revenge G Alternative with, uh, Reba, Reba Bata, or however you pronounce that,

02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:06.960
and then, of course, uh, Paranoid Hades, so that's kind of cool, and let's see here, real

02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:15.680
quick, that's a lot of last minute stories, sorry, sorry, I'm quickly, I'm trying to be

02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:21.560
quick, um, GPS coming to the PSP within nine months, uh, there are details releasing some

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:28.280
Famicom inspired classic controllers, so you can import those if you want them, um, let's

02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:33.720
see here, well, it was E3 week, so it was a little busy this week, fun little bit of

02:38:33.720 --> 02:38:39.920
trivia, Animal Crossing, which was being shown off at E3, actually had, of course, none other

02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:46.000
than Charles Martinet playing the game as well from an undisclosed location with a Mario

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:51.200
style avatar, and, uh, he was riffing people in the Mario voice, and was also hitting people

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:55.200
with axes and complaining about people that ran over his flowers, I'm thinking undisclosed

02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:59.400
location means backstage, because, yeah, I don't know if you remember when they showed

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:04.360
off the whole, uh, voice chat, or the DS, uh, internet thing, but they had, uh, Charles

02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:09.000
Martinet in Seattle, right, remember that, uh, and then you would see him, like, an hour

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:14.320
later walking around the show floor, yeah, cause he could teleport, um, there is a rumor

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:19.000
that someone is working on a PSP emulator for the Wii, and they have screenshots, unfortunately

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:22.520
right now it's only running at about seven frames per second, but that's still disturbing

02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:26.640
nonetheless, Animal Crossing will support USB keyboards, so you can actually type your

02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:31.120
messages to people without having to use the Wii remote, because that sucked, uh, Gears

02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:35.520
of War 2 is coming out November 7th this year, so people are probably excited about that,

02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:40.480
uh, LittleBigPlanet is going to allow you to charge users for your content that you

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:46.920
created, oh god, so you can make money off that shit, um, there's apparently some shocking

02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:56.280
announcement coming to, um, the DKS3713, um, event put out by Square Enix, something related

02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:04.160
to Final Fantasy VII, uh oh, uh, Rock Band 2 is going to be, the release of this is really

02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:10.480
strange, um, the game only version for the Xbox 360 is coming out in September, the bundle,

02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:15.720
as long as, with the PS3 bundle, the PS3 standalone version is coming out in October, and then

02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:22.240
the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions I think are coming out in November, is that confusing

02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:29.440
enough, um, and then let's see here, and then my favorite thing, which I'm going to end

02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:37.000
on here real quick, is that, um, there's a quote taken from, uh, G4, apparently is an

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:42.280
interview with Reggie Fils-Aime, who says, how could you feel left out? The Animal Crossing

02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:48.080
that we've been hearing about that people wanted, uh, fully connected to the internet,

02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:52.460
go to other people's towns, plus I said Grand Theft Auto on the DS, how do you feel left

02:40:52.460 --> 02:41:01.700
out with those types of announcements? Well, it's quite easy. There's about 500 other things

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:07.280
you didn't address, but maybe it's just me. I'm not a casual gamer, what do I know? Alright,

02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:11.280
thank you for the, uh, follow-up updates, although quite lengthy, it was E3 week, there's

02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:15.520
a lot of shit going on, next week I'm sure we'll have a lot of stuff too, as the fallout

02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:20.720
begins from E3 and we start ramping up towards Christmas, as was said earlier, but for now,

02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:25.240
we go around and we get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:30.000
My final thought is, this is actually kind of funny, there's, um, apparently Dead Rising,

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.640
the Wii version is being called Dead Rising Zombie Sacrifice in Japan, and I don't know

02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.760
if this is true, but for the US version, I heard that they're calling it Dead Rising

02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:47.640
Chop Until You Drop. Cheesy. I like that. My final thought is, I kind of want a burrito.

02:41:47.640 --> 02:41:55.080
Dark Soccer, your final thought? Uh oh, we might have to chop till we drop Dark Soccer,

02:41:55.080 --> 02:42:00.960
she sounds like she's turning into a zombie. That is a distinct possibility. Alright, um,

02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:07.240
until then, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and

02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:11.120
supporting Orange Launcher. Remember, if you like what you hear, oh, sorry. God damn it.

02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:15.680
Sorry. Sorry. I am ending this damn show. This is important. No, we want to do the cage

02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:21.040
match. This is important, real quick. DDRX, they're reviving some of their old, um, licensed

02:42:21.040 --> 02:42:24.760
songs, including Dubby Dub and Butterfly, and they may have mentioned that last week,

02:42:24.760 --> 02:42:30.300
but I don't remember. Either way. Dubby Dub's coming back. Do not want. That might make

02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:35.280
a headache worse, won't it? I've got a very bad headache right now. I'm sorry. Alright,

02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:39.560
well remember, if you like what you hear, we persevere through the headaches and through

02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:43.480
the fire and the flames to bring you this program each and every week. Please tell two

02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.560
friends you know about the program. That's how we spread around the world slowly. Hey,

02:42:47.560 --> 02:42:50.960
we'll see you at PAX in a few weeks. Those of you that are going, all three of us are

02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:54.240
going to be there, and I can't wait to meet you guys. I don't know if there will be an

02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:57.840
OLR meetup one night, but I imagine we'll do something. It's going to be a party. It's

02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:04.080
going to be so much fun. Right, Loki? It's so much fun? I don't know. I've never been

02:43:04.080 --> 02:43:09.280
to PAX. Alright. Until then, we'll see you guys next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:14.920
