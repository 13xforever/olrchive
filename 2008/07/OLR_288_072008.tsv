14226	15327	Night, July 20th, 2008.
15407	25616	At E3, Microsoft announces a Netflix partnership, Sony is set to launch a new MAG game, and Nintendo announces a Grand Theft Audible portable game.
31584	35326	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
35366	41308	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
41388	44069	But we're not cool enough for E3, I'm sorry to say.
44190	48451	No, we just sat here bitter all week long eating our bonbons and watching it on TV.
48531	49312	Right, DarkSakura?
49892	50792	My lovely co-host?
51213	51673	Hell no.
52073	52793	I did other stuff.
53073	53454	Like what?
53594	54214	Going outside?
54254	54634	What's that?
55695	58076	I went to Classic Gaming Expo.
58136	58916	Not Classic Gaming Expo.
58936	59576	What the hell am I saying?
60136	61077	California Extreme.
61530	62051	TechMasterLoki
80063	80883	I'm doing okay.
81164	81764	All right.
82404	83825	Now, you did not go to California Extreme.
84085	85225	No, I did not go to California Extreme.
85245	87026	What did you do in lieu of E3 this year?
87306	91228	I actually watched E3, watched the press conferences streaming.
91668	94609	During work, I might add, because it technically is work-related.
94849	97591	All right, you sell the games, so it's kind of work-related for you.
97871	100092	Yeah, I tried getting that past management.
100132	102433	Luckily, management wasn't there, so we watched it anyways.
102773	103773	Nice.
104173	105394	Yeah, so it was interesting.
106939	128278	I ended up reading it through blogs because my day job I teach, not kids but adults, I teach in a corporate environment and so I didn't really have a chance to watch anything live so I just had to kind of read it through blogs but you know people had it covered I guess although it would have been more exciting to be there but you know what can you do
129107	138816	You can go to a different expo, that's what you can do And we'll talk more about that in a little while But first, let's hear about the trip that Jamie took this week Which I'm surprised somebody would do a gaming expo the same week as E3 But you went on a little trip, right?
139449	143091	Yes, I went all day for Saturday.
143291	144871	It ended today.
145511	150514	But I ran into lots of people that I know, including someone in our chat room right now, GS68.
151874	152234	Cool.
152514	153435	Who actually found me.
154295	155135	Nice hat, by the way.
156736	158377	And I ran into Mella Melody.
159337	161358	I ran into Wendell and some of his buddies.
162378	165620	And saw a few other notable personages.
166620	168761	I actually saw Jason Enos in line.
169773	178081	GS68 has actually posted his share of pictures from the event on his little photo bucket in our chat room, chat.orangelonsradio.com.
178101	179342	And what's this I see here?
179402	180483	I think this might be a picture.
181084	184827	Ah, yes, there is DarkSakura, our very own little space invader.
185168	185428	Nice.
186028	187330	Melody and I wanted to steal it.
187550	190673	And some other lady with her ass on the table right next to you.
194321	195142	I look like hell Like hell
215987	216888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
236801	238022	and a few more recent ones.
238342	240202	Dude, there's a spider again!
241783	246825	I got an email with a Journey arcade game picture, so I know you played that at least.
246885	247425	I didn't play it.
247445	247965	Melody did.
250086	252047	It made part of my soul hurt.
252267	252547	Why?
253267	255548	Just because I cried from nostalgia.
256229	260790	Did she get the... She finally got the concert toward the end of the day.
260830	263471	I was going to say, you have to get the tape to play.
263932	264632	That's the best part.
265040	266541	Okay, so, games.
266681	270004	I've got a list of stuff I did and did not play.
271104	276508	First of all, they had a demo of a Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remake set up.
277729	288657	And they had a PlayStation 3 set up with the online games, including Puzzle Fighter HD, which I watched Wendell and Mel play.
290239	296481	Melody and I played Ride and Fighters 2, which was pretty fucking sweet, and I got 5th highest score.
296881	298782	They had the Prop Cycle Addams Family there.
300562	300802	What?
301503	304604	You know the people that have the Prop Cycle set up to play Addams Family?
305064	306024	No, I haven't seen that.
306044	308025	Oh, you have too, because we commented on it.
308105	308405	Really?
309205	311126	I've seen the Prop Cycle, but I've never seen it.
311166	311506	Let me see.
316357	317778	Oh, that is kind of strange.
318579	327326	Is actually someone on a prop cycle attached to an Addams Family and the game runs as you pedal.
328527	328887	Interesting.
329087	330468	I've had pictures of this set before.
331769	332450	Moving on.
333551	334692	My phone's upside down, Rob.
336223	337304	Star Wars Racer Arcade
351659	355563	and I think it was like a submarine or space game before or something, but it was kind of neat.
356204	358346	They had Blasteroids there, which I didn't play.
358847	363652	And I was so mad because I took a picture of a guy in a Big Bang Bar shirt, but the picture didn't come out well.
364053	366655	And then they had one of those mini SNK cabinets.
367596	368938	Like, there's, if you can see...
371179	373302	We had to play on our knees to play it.
374264	375506	And so we played Puzzle Bobble.
375546	380814	And Melody and I played a sit-down of Crystal Castles, the two-player sit-downs.
381314	381655	Oh, cool.
381675	383418	Like one of the cocktail, yeah.
383738	384860	You set your drink on it.
385502	388483	and then I didn't... Oh yeah, this is a picture of some dude playing Journey.
389584	392685	So is it just Arcade Game Madness or what?
392705	394945	They have these little panels and stuff there too, right?
394965	395486	Yeah, panels.
395966	405229	Dan went to the panel that had Steve Ritchie, who's the guy who designed some of the best pins ever, like Twilight Zone and No Fear.
405269	407070	We actually have a lot of the games that he designed.
408030	409531	By the way, they did have Tapper, but I didn't play.
409911	410171	Awesome.
410971	413212	But they...
415311	420755	He went to that panel, and then I went to a panel later on with Dan to see someone talk about customizing.
421795	425778	I'm trying to be understanding because it was his first panel, it just wasn't very well presented.
426579	430641	I think, you know, with a little bit of experience he can do better, but there were some interesting things.
431722	434424	And then we went to a panel about the guy who made Donkey Kong 2.
436155	442979	As in, he sprite-ripped and redid levels to have going after the original four in Donkey Kong.
443119	447161	Because I was going to say, wait, Donkey Kong 2 is Donkey Kong Jr., but this is a different thing.
447181	448722	This is an actual Donkey Kong 2.
449442	449942	Interesting.
450243	453805	And you can find the... He actually has a website and everything.
454865	458727	And then I went to watch Tilt, but I only watched the first part of it because I've seen the rest of it.
459608	464250	But it's like about the end of William's pinball division in the Pinball 2000 that came out.
464590	465671	It did play some episode one.
466191	468634	And I played a sit-down Sinistar.
488410	489370	Beware, I live
508601	510703	and then, oh, there's my beer.
511123	522253	I also played an eight ball deluxe, which is the, I think as far, if I'm right, is the second highest grossing flipper using pinball table.
522593	523714	The first being Addams Family.
525402	527983	and then I played the Ted Nugent pinball, which was actually really good.
528003	529463	I didn't even know that existed.
529683	532623	Galaga 98, Pacmania, Monopoly, Pango.
532963	534404	There was a Pango in a really good condition.
534684	535124	I love Pango.
535164	536724	A really good, pretty Tron.
538404	539145	How many people were there?
539565	539985	Tons.
541025	542445	There were just a lot of people.
543705	547026	Although I honestly don't know that the turnout this year was as good as last.
547106	548186	They didn't have the auction.
549126	551507	Do you think it might have to do with the fact they're holding at the same time as E3 too?
552423	554024	I don't think that was really their choice.
554584	558847	Because from what I understand, they were trying to avoid scheduling around the Jazz Festival in San Jose.
559347	560568	Now, this one's a cool one.
560668	563769	If you can see, it's a black Spider-Man pinball machine.
564210	565851	They only made, I think, 500 of them.
566771	567592	So someone brought it in.
568052	570813	And if you hit the right flipper button, you can play it in Spanish.
572234	582219	And then there's this guy here who had a Flynn's t-shirt on, which if anyone is a big Tron nut like me, you know that that's the name of the arcade that the guy had.
582579	583820	And then this was really cool.
584360	597107	Someone took the wizard pinball table, which was the one that Elton John was playing in Tommy, and made the big boots and put it up on a stand to play on like in Tommy's.
597327	606111	Alright, I have to address this, because Bobby's saying this in our chatroom, chat.orangelearnsradio.com, and our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who's on before us on allgames.com, he says, It wasn't the same time as E3.
606511	607451	E3 ended Thursday.
607531	609532	If anything, it made it easier for someone to attend it.
609632	611113	They could just hop up after E3.
611473	614154	But I'm thinking, like, okay, I've been to E3 in the past.
614214	615475	Granted, it was a lot different back then.
615895	617535	I know how I felt at the end of E3.
617976	619016	I didn't want to do shit.
619296	622858	The idea of another gaming expo was, like, the furthest thing from my mind.
623718	627725	If somebody had told me, hey, let's go to a gaming expo tomorrow, I would be like, you've got to be kidding me.
628807	629809	So, I don't know.
630029	633856	Maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too close together.
634076	635539	You gotta give it at least a month.
636594	637575	It would have been really tight.
637755	648843	I just have to say the one day of me going, well, granted, I didn't have the medication that I have to take, but I got so tired just walking around.
650444	660831	Because we left the house at 10, and we got there just a little bit after noon, actually closer to 1, so Dan could hit that panel he wanted to go to.
663213	664894	But just walking around all day.
665546	666887	Just all day walking.
667547	670549	And I was pretty much dead tired.
670589	671649	I did nothing but sleep today.
672410	673970	You better prepare yourself for PAX.
674110	675011	That's going to be three days.
675351	676412	I'm going to bring better shoes.
676572	676892	All right.
677772	678373	Oh, my God, shoes.
679293	679473	All right.
679493	680754	Oh, my God, shoes.
680774	682075	Thank you for the lovely report.
682775	684536	We'll hear more from Dan later, possibly.
685016	685616	Well, no.
686557	686797	All right.
686817	687878	But go to our forum.
689068	695912	In our Orange Lounge chat area, I did post up the review that Dan wrote for us.
696513	700035	Since we have nowhere on the front page to do it... Yet.
700455	700735	Yet.
702456	702757	Alright.
703297	705218	But Dan wrote a lengthy review.
706699	710661	Loki, how was your gaming week while you weren't attending any cool expos?
710882	711622	Like the cool kids.
712563	713163	It was okay.
713763	713944	Like...
715902	716562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
733683	734523	Tales of Vesperia.
734884	735444	I didn't like it.
736485	737565	I really wanted to like it.
737605	739186	I already had it pre-ordered.
739746	743989	It looked like a game I could probably get into, kind of like Eternal Sonata or something like that.
745630	750652	What did it for me is I thought it was a little cheesy.
751373	752873	I mean, the graphics are awesome.
753254	755815	The graphics are just like Eternal Sonata, I noticed.
755995	757496	The combat was kind of annoying.
757656	758256	I didn't like the combat.
758276	759077	Probably the same voice actors, too.
759457	761478	Yeah, I didn't like the combat one bit.
761498	763178	That kind of ruined it for me.
764139	771701	It's all kind of real-time, and you switch between your characters, and you cast spells and stuff, and everyone kind of is on autopilot, which kind of sucked.
773042	779844	I liked Eternal Sonata a lot better, where it was turn-based, and you could do all that real-time stuff within a certain time limit.
780104	783545	I thought that was pretty cool, but this was kind of all over the place.
784486	784646	And...
785966	789108	Then my buddy played Too Human.
789128	792390	I didn't get a chance to play it because I tried downloading the demo twice.
792450	795112	Both times it was corrupted, so that was awesome.
795852	799035	And here it was just mediocre, so I don't know.
799055	802977	But he's going to buy it because he liked games like Conan and stuff like that.
803477	804958	Which, you know, I kind of like that too.
805459	807880	It doesn't really take much to impress me as far as action games go.
807920	809641	I mean, I don't know.
810262	810702	But, um...
811983	813524	I did play some DS games.
813564	815426	I played Metal Slug 7 a bit.
815986	820010	And I didn't really play the main game of it, because, I mean, shit, it's just Metal Slug.
820710	824073	But they had these, like, challenge mode things in there, and that was kind of interesting.
824113	828497	You had different tasks, and once you finish those, you go up in rank and stuff like that.
828917	829478	It gets harder.
829558	832440	So that's kind of cool with the added replayability.
833021	834462	And then I played...
835703	836464	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
857645	858426	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
876940	878561	And... What else did I play?
879161	880481	I think that was pretty much it.
881121	882362	I was just kind of going all over the place.
882442	885323	Oh, I went back to play some old Xbox Live Arcade games.
885583	886563	Played Zuma some more.
887423	888143	Because that's fun.
888704	892765	Because now that I have it hooked up to the TV again, Nelly's like, Oh, Zuma, I can play this again.
893465	893585	So...
894784	900812	Alright, sounds like you were keeping yourself busy with what you already have, games you already have to beat.
901072	907561	Exactly, and I was just looking at, there was stuff that came out this week, Xbox Live Arcade stuff, but all of it sucked.
908732	909853	and, uh, ooh, Tuesday.
910154	910795	This Tuesday.
912076	915400	My DS, I gotta dust it off with what's coming out this Tuesday.
916061	917783	We'll tell you later in the show when we get to release dates.
918143	921848	However, uh, my gaming week, I'll keep it short, um, because there really wasn't a lot to it.
921868	923429	I played most of the same stuff I've been playing.
923510	928055	Civ Rev, uh, Space Invaders Dream on PSP, but I had a little bit of Renaissance as well.
928515	928776	I, uh,
929176	930476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
954523	955684	What's the point of this game?
957105	958946	He's kind of like, why do you like this game?
959086	960187	It seems like there's no point.
960547	962088	And I'm like, you're kind of right.
962248	963189	There is no point.
963549	964270	That's the point.
964650	965470	It's like The Sims.
965891	967412	There's no real point to that either.
968793	972395	But I thought I would play it to try and collect more of the NES games.
972655	977979	Because remember that was one awesome thing about Animal Crossing on the GameCube is that it had all the old school NES games buried in it.
977999	979480	Like you could get like Clue Clue Land.
979900	980761	How awesome is that?
981141	982022	And Donkey Kong Jr.
982102	982422	Math.
983820	984220	GameCubeVersion.com
1004545	1009732	So it's already outputting pretty much the same level that other Wii games would.
1009792	1016581	Granted, the slightly more advanced Wii hardware would probably make a better F-Zero game, but I want to see something like F-Zero on like 720, 1080 level.
1016641	1019024	That would be awesome.
1019564	1020325	Was that like F-Zero?
1020345	1021307	That's a fun racing game.
1022847	1026509	And I was a little sad they didn't announce that, a new F-Zero game at their press conference.
1026549	1027149	But what can you do?
1027289	1033172	But you have to understand, the E3 wasn't for the core gamer, for at least Nintendo.
1033993	1038675	So all the stuff they announced was casual stuff.
1038755	1045419	GameGuru in chat, chat.northstar.com, does correct me and says Donkey Kong Junior Math is on the virtual console, but it's not worth $5.
1046579	1050701	Correct, it's not worth $5 considering you can get an Animal Crossing for free.
1051422	1051922	There you have it.
1054003	1058406	Alright, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping.
1058926	1063628	This week, as we announced at our own E3 press conference last week, you will get one big show.
1064028	1067330	Hopefully everything on the technical end works, but you will get one big show.
1067390	1073073	There will no longer be part A and B, so the podcast feed might look a little different because of that, but that'll be pretty cool.
1074073	1075194	And that's it.
1075274	1080455	Otherwise, continue to support us by giving us positive reviews on iTunes.
1080495	1081496	We always appreciate that.
1081876	1085537	There's been a few new ones that have popped up lately, some very nice five-star reviews.
1085817	1091339	In fact, right now, if I checked correctly, we have exactly 69 reviews on iTunes right now, which is a great number to be at.
1091719	1092319	So thank you very much.
1092379	1095120	We would like some more, as nice as a 69 number is.
1095460	1096021	So don't forget that.
1097805	1099026	Our LiveJournal community.
1099086	1101887	We are at Community Orange Lounge on LiveJournal.
1101907	1102527	So look us up there.
1102627	1106149	Facebook OL Army on MySpace at Orange Lounge Radio.
1106209	1111611	So we are your social networking BFFs on any of those sites you want to be our buds on.
1112011	1112272	All right.
1112632	1113852	Let's get into some gaming news.
1113892	1117014	This week a little different because we had E3 happen this week.
1117434	1120375	Nothing but press conference stuff in this half of the show.
1120395	1123977	We're going to talk about kind of the big three press conferences and our thoughts on it since –
1124557	1126719	Final Fantasy XIII would be coming to the Xbox 360 day and date in the U.S.,
1144031	1144972	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1167427	1174674	It is not going to be coming, it's not exclusive in, or not coming to the Xbox 360 in Japan though.
1175074	1175515	Interesting.
1175835	1178858	But in the US, it will be coming out day and date.
1179579	1183803	Which really kind of shows that this whole move is motivated nothing by but sales.
1184183	1186626	Basically that they feel they have a better chance of penetrating the marketplace.
1186686	1187346	I think so, yeah.
1187787	1188548	Very interesting.
1189068	1193470	But my curiosity is, how long is it going to make this game be out?
1194030	1196131	I mean, like, how far do we have to wait for this game?
1196471	1200013	Because they admitted they haven't even really started developing this game for the 360.
1200333	1204695	I mean, they've been doing it on some type of PC design, like, what do they call it, Crystal or something?
1205015	1207056	They do it on, you know, it's probably their own design platform.
1208076	1208877	I think here's the thing.
1209197	1211538	It's not really going to be an issue with storage.
1211598	1213338	It's not going to be a problem getting it.
1213838	1215839	Obviously, it's not going to be on one disc, but that's fine.
1216839	1223022	I think it's actually not going to hold them up too much because it's a lot easier to develop for the 360 than it is for the PS3.
1223842	1231465	I know that Square Enix has a lot more experience developing for the 360 right now rather than the PS3.
1232225	1235386	I don't think it's really going to hold it up any more than localizing it would.
1237365	1254301	Mace Hatsuma in chat asked the question that I've been actually getting asked a lot this week because I've been pretty open on this show that I had no plans to get a Playstation 3 until Final Fantasy XIII came out so now this is a question I've been getting a lot this week as I'm sure a lot of people like me have Mace Hatsuma says will you buy a PS3 now?
1254321	1257144	You always said you'll buy a PS3 when Final Fantasy XIII comes out
1261434	1262515	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1283191	1283792	Thanks for watching!
1297888	1300330	is Sony likely to come down in price on those systems later?
1300531	1301852	We'll hear more about that later, I'm sure.
1303473	1313321	The thing I think also, too, you have to look at is from the publisher's standpoint, when they put this game out, and it's not even necessarily this game, because I'm thinking Last Remnant is going to be out way before this.
1314382	1317485	When that comes out, they're going to look at the sales of that
1317985	1319165	Game on both consoles.
1319445	1325107	And if it's anything like Grand Theft Auto 4 was, it's going to be a lot more on the 360 than it is on the PS3.
1325147	1326147	Now, that may not be the case.
1326287	1327928	Obviously, it's not going to be the case in Japan.
1328468	1333649	But they have to look at each market separately and kind of base their decisions on that.
1333669	1339531	Because if they were just to base it all on the Japanese market, then we wouldn't be getting anything on the 360.
1341089	1341970	I got two questions.
1342070	1346395	First is for Jamie because I haven't heard anything yet and I know you like Final Fantasy like the rest of us.
1346435	1347476	What was your reaction to the news?
1349102	1351324	I really didn't care.
1352366	1353327	I have both systems.
1354107	1357551	That leads into my next question, that you and Loki own both systems.
1358272	1372186	Knowing that Final Fantasy XIII, I guess you could say for all practical purposes, was being designed for the PlayStation 3, now it's coming out for the 360, do you think you're more inclined to get it on PlayStation 3, or what system do you think you might ultimately get this game on?
1372466	1373727	or have you even decided yet?
1373747	1384398	Probably PS3 because if that's what it was designed for then that's what it was designed for but it doesn't mean that later on I won't pick it up dirt cheap for Xbox 360.
1385499	1386700	I mean, depends on features.
1386981	1387181	Loki?
1387441	1387961	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1409474	1413657	What if they come out and say, you know what, the 360 version did have to take a little hit in quality?
1414137	1415858	I don't care.
1416838	1422122	Now, if I were you, if I heard one iota of the 360 is going to have to sacrifice something, I'd pick it up on PS3.
1422322	1424223	I don't give a shit about achievements.
1424503	1427965	Name one game out there that runs better on the PS3 than the 360.
1429486	1430386	There isn't one.
1430566	1431807	It's always the other way around.
1432287	1434948	Sony fanboys and chat.orange.com, please.
1436408	1439109	I hear Oblivion's a little bit graphically better, but I don't know.
1439609	1442270	Yeah, but we're talking marginally.
1442410	1451053	This isn't going to be breaking any sort of... There's no discernible difference in between the two.
1452854	1457295	Look at all the games that come out now, and they do that stupid comparison between the 360 and PS3 versions.
1459284	1462228	There's minimal differences.
1462588	1470659	Unless you're talking when the PS3 version comes out and there's lag issues, frame rate issues, freezing issues, and stuff like that.
1472501	1472862	I don't know.
1473042	1475886	It's just not worth...
1477850	1479511	Picking up on the PS3 for.
1479972	1484195	Now, not to say that, like I said, there's stuff on the PS3 I definitely want.
1484275	1485416	Resistance Fallman 2.
1485997	1487958	Fuck yeah, I will be getting that on the PS3.
1487978	1491361	Alright, a couple people, a couple comments in chat.
1491621	1493603	Burnout Paradise is a game that's being mentioned.
1494524	1498127	And Joshi16 gives the lulz with Metal Gear Solid 4 plays better.
1499465	1501186	Yeah, but Burnout Paradise, okay, look at Burnout Paradise.
1501206	1503926	Hold on, hold on, let's let Jamie say it, because you wanted to say something a minute ago.
1503946	1518551	I was just going to say, still, all of that actually means really nothing to me, because I had already decided to get it on, you know, I had kept it in my head open that if it came out on Xbox 360, I don't, first of all, it's not coming out in Japan on Xbox 360.
1519051	1520392	They're not going to get the release.
1521532	1527176	This means that I can actually interact with a larger community on the PlayStation 3 version, first of all.
1527536	1531578	I don't care about achievements, and I really don't care about going online.
1533960	1542325	I would be able to find more stuff, a larger community, especially for me who loves the fan side of it.
1542585	1548429	I honestly think that the controller scheme lends itself better to RPGs on the PlayStation than on Xbox.
1548669	1550531	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1566148	1567088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1583226	1588669	The other half of the fun for me is actually going on international sites and seeing what the world reaction is.
1589269	1591110	I love looking at fan art.
1591150	1593832	I love finding fan sites.
1593912	1594592	I think it's fun.
1594752	1597114	But that's fine, but that's not platform specific.
1597214	1599175	You're not going to only have PS3 fans.
1599535	1609300	That doesn't necessarily... That'd be like saying, for example, that you have fans for Eternal Sonata, but there's going to be fans for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 version.
1609400	1610321	It doesn't matter...
1611141	1611922	Thanks for watching!
1630677	1632758	Alright, let me let the chat have the last word here.
1633559	1637321	Ossifer says, isn't Versus XIII still exclusive to the PS3 in the US?
1637802	1639923	Even if it is, I'm sure that game will jump ship too.
1640724	1644806	Sales will probably be a big question as to whether that happens or not, I'd imagine.
1645787	1648349	Well, Versus XIII I don't think has been announced for the US yet.
1648529	1652211	It's still Japanese only, and if that's the case, then yeah, it probably still is PS3.
1652371	1660277	Well, they showed the trailer at E3 a couple years ago, so I'm thinking it's going to be... Yeah, but they also showed the trailer for Star Ocean like two years ago too, so...
1661017	1665481	As Sephiroth1215 and Xenocore agree, say the D-pad on the 360 is what's horrible.
1665522	1666603	And I agree.
1666743	1668704	That D-pad on 360 is awful.
1669545	1672508	That's the problem with the controller right there, is that D-pad.
1672828	1678273	Because I don't like to use the analog stick with a lot of Xbox Live Arcade games, and that D-pad sucks.
1678834	1680896	Especially for the retro games and fighters.
1681316	1681957	It's fighters.
1682057	1682818	That's the thing.
1682858	1685500	That's what the PlayStation 3 controller, I think, is better, is fighters.
1686321	1686441	But...
1686994	1687474	You know what?
1688535	1696381	If they wanted to take a clue from the best controller ever made, they should look at the Sega Saturn Dual Analog Controller for their model.
1698002	1699763	I like the Super Nintendo Controller.
1699803	1701445	It was a lot less complicated.
1701465	1707409	The Super Nintendo Controller, though, is also one of the primary inspirations for the PlayStation Controller.
1708390	1712793	Well, I'm sorry that you'll be handicapped when you get to the fighting game portions of Final Fantasy XIII.
1712813	1713453	Alright, shut up.
1713513	1714214	We're moving on.
1714694	1723178	Alright, other big news out of Microsoft's press conference that has to do with the installation of Xbox 360 games to your hard drive.
1723438	1729281	They actually announced that now you're going to be able to actually copy the games to your hard drive so you can play the games directly off your hard drive.
1729421	1738505	But, if you're thinking this means, haha, I can get them from Gamefly, copy them to my hard drive and send them back, no, you still have to have the original disc to play the game.
1739125	1741106	I'm curious how long that takes to get cracked though.
1741166	1742266	Yep, not long.
1742406	1743387	I'm curious because
1744167	1746789	People could probably burn their own CDs and bypass it.
1746869	1749291	I'm very interested to see how they security lock this.
1749631	1750011	We'll see.
1750091	1751032	We'll see.
1751672	1754955	Also, you're going to be able to access the marketplace on the web.
1755275	1767244	So if you're not next to the 360, you're surfing the internet at work like you shouldn't be, you can actually go on the internet and queue up downloads to automatically go to your 360, which sounds kind of interesting.
1767264	1769345	That would be pretty awesome is if they had a mode.
1769405	1771887	And they have this, I think, with the PS3 a little bit where you can...
1773388	1776951	Access your content from any hotspot or something like that.
1777011	1788862	But what if you could, say, leave your 360 in a standby mode and queue something up to download on your 360 from a PC that's nowhere near it and then actually have it download while you're out.
1789162	1789583	You know what I mean?
1790223	1797005	I guess that's kind of cool though if you don't like all those loading times on Xbox 360 on certain games.
1797665	1800105	It doesn't sound like it's going to really help the load times too much.
1800145	1802506	It's only going to improve them by 30% from what I read.
1803486	1803966	Interesting.
1804747	1806367	What games do you think will benefit most from this?
1807947	1810228	You can even do multi-disk installs though apparently.
1810248	1813709	If you want to install disc 2 and 3 of Lost Odyssey on your drive, you could do that.
1814249	1815709	I don't know why you would, but you could.
1816950	1818070	It's nice that it's an option.
1819387	1846610	um you know that's nice in case you want to do that and you don't have to but it would be nicer if I didn't have to have the original disc I mean granted I understand why they're doing it that way if they didn't piracy would run rampant but I wish there was some other type of way it could be validated that I actually owned and bought the game because I would love to just you know not have to swap discs out all the time like just pop up a menu on my 360 pick the game and go like the arcade games I love that
1847401	1847961	It would be nice.
1848862	1855385	Well, they could do that, but... Maybe authenticating with a serial number or something?
1855405	1856145	Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
1856165	1858667	Like a serial key just like they do with MMOs and PC games.
1858707	1859307	Question mark?
1859367	1859767	I don't know.
1859987	1860387	Xbox?
1860668	1862248	Think about that for next year's E3.
1862268	1863449	I would love to be able to do that.
1864875	1867939	Seems to me that the key code would probably be the best way.
1868080	1869141	But that's also a problem, too.
1869181	1875550	Like, if you look, I know this is a small market, but rental market, you know, if you're renting it out with the manual and the key codes in there.
1875570	1877533	Yeah.
1878094	1878314	Yeah.
1878614	1878875	We'll see.
1880409	1886232	Well, for anyone who's been looking for a sequel to Portal, there is an official one.
1887292	1889133	It's actually Portal's still alive.
1889373	1897736	It's going to be basically the single player story that was in Orange Box with some new challenges.
1898036	1899537	It's supposed to be on the Xbox Live Arcade.
1900517	1901838	Nothing about PC or PS3.
1903171	1904932	I think they already have this on the PC, actually.
1904992	1911534	They released a map pack that was based off the Flash Portal game, the 2D one, and that's what these levels are.
1911694	1915035	Those are the same levels that were available on the PC, I want to say for free.
1915556	1919657	But they've been la-di-da-ing this thing as an exclusive on the 360, right?
1919717	1929141	It is exclusive on the 360, this version of the game, like as a standalone thing, but it really is just those download maps that were available on the PC for free.
1929801	1931141	You know what though I hear about this game?
1931161	1931982	There's no GLaDOS.
1932302	1933282	That kind of makes me sad.
1934142	1935183	That's sadness.
1935403	1935943	It is sadness.
1936383	1937823	But hopefully there will still be cake.
1938164	1941865	Maybe this time, Jamie, maybe there's pie at the end this time.
1942305	1943325	But there's no story.
1943405	1944946	It's just challenge levels.
1945546	1946886	It's like the VR missions.
1948227	1954228	I guess, Jamie, you were quite the fan of Portal and I think a lot of the reason you liked it was the humor in it and the story, right?
1954609	1955289	Does this kind of...
1956605	1961891	I don't know, to me this seems a little bit milking, but I enjoyed the game in Portal 2, I really did.
1962752	1968638	But I'm kind of curious, what do you think about this, being that there's kind of less story, more just puzzle, puzzle, puzzle?
1969138	1971541	For the people who like the puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, that's good for them.
1972221	1973503	I just want snarky commentary.
1973983	1978408	If there's no snarky commentary, then... But you could make your own!
1980013	1992875	I'll let Dan play it and then I'll provide the snarky commentary you know what would make this game awesome other than cake is if later on for a few more Microsoft points they could release a level editor
1994079	1997321	for the arcade game and then release it where you can share levels.
1997602	1999643	But then what would they do for the actual Portal 2?
2000204	2001124	For the actual Portal 2?
2001404	2002165	I don't know.
2002205	2007909	Well, I mean, this might be Portal 2, but you know what I'm talking about, like a Portal actual full sequel.
2007949	2009791	Well, they can add some additional elements.
2009851	2013513	I think for the Portal PC game, they had levels and stuff with alternate...
2014734	2017977	Gravity sections where you're actually on the ceiling and stuff like that.
2018077	2019879	Really twisty, weird stuff.
2020299	2025644	So if they add that into Portal 2, and I think Portal 2 is supposed to be kind of different than Portal 1 altogether.
2026025	2028187	You know, kind of a different environment, more like Half-Life.
2030148	2031430	Then, yeah, there's a lot more to do.
2031450	2033271	I think that Lesserface is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.
2034552	2037455	Plus there's the guy that sounds like Colonel Sanders in there.
2037695	2039937	Oh, the G-Man?
2039998	2040158	Yeah.
2041067	2047678	No, no, the new guy, the new ghost of portal creator guy or whatever.
2048579	2053588	The one whose initials that you enter into the website to do the test that you can't save the results of.
2054045	2054325	I guess.
2055186	2060729	SSJ100Matt says in chat, they better give a free Carvel cake coupon with the new portal because they lied to us last time.
2060749	2061389	That would be funny.
2061409	2063110	That would be great.
2063530	2069294	And some folks in chat are imagining the play at home with DarkSakura making the commentary to Dan while he's playing.
2069974	2073596	Joshi16 says, DarkSakura to Dan, play better.
2075137	2078439	And ActDeft says, complete the puzzle or the cube dies.
2079477	2080297	No, no, no.
2081398	2085099	Half the time with Dan playing is me just trying to shut up because I figured out the puzzle.
2085799	2087380	Only I get too motion sick to do it.
2088520	2090721	So I'll be sitting there going, and he'll be like, what?
2090821	2093022	I'll be like, you should have done the portal over there.
2093382	2096423	Because then it'll come up over here, and if you do it this way, then this will happen.
2096783	2098184	He's like, oh.
2100084	2104306	He has that little, what I call the Charlie Brown cloud with a little cloud of steam over their head.
2104366	2106847	I have to just bite my lip and not say anything.
2107667	2107707	Ow.
2108993	2110093	All right, anyway, moving on.
2111374	2111634	All right.
2112895	2118457	Well, other news coming out of the Microsoft press conference.
2118477	2123799	I know this is a total shock because this was kept under super secret wraps.
2124679	2131202	Lips, their new karaoke game was announced and they had a lot of details on that, including...
2132816	2133617	Some pretty cool stuff.
2134097	2140304	Obviously the microphones are going to be motion sensitive and they're wireless as they should be.
2141586	2142306	They've got...
2143649	2143949	DarkSakura,
2174169	2175109	This sounds interesting.
2175670	2176730	I'm down with lips.
2177010	2179891	It looks a lot like Seeing Star to me, but I think Seeing Star is kind of fun.
2180551	2182692	It looks like this is Microsoft's thing.
2182712	2184792	They take other people's ideas and make them better.
2186053	2188093	Well, granted, it's not Microsoft themselves doing this.
2188173	2189333	It's the Elite Beat Agents folks.
2189413	2191114	But, hey, I love Elite Beat Agents.
2191174	2191874	It looks pretty cool.
2192634	2193655	This will be a karaoke game.
2193675	2195955	There's some other cool stuff about that, too.
2196736	2197736	They were saying that...
2198516	2199977	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2225889	2232856	Um, saying that they're not sure if they're going to allow you to stream, like, say, your library if you have a PC connected on your network.
2232916	2234618	You know, you can stream music usually.
2235218	2236920	I'm not sure if they're going to allow you to do that.
2237541	2240604	Um, and also, um...
2241324	2245269	No word if you're going to actually be able to implement your own lyrics or song chart or something like that.
2246410	2248753	But they had some interesting ideas, I guess.
2248993	2250915	Some of the songs confirmed for it already.
2251356	2256341	They had Mercy by Duffy, Young Folk by Peter, and...
2257762	2262303	Peter, Bjorn, John, and Bust a Move by Young MC.
2262343	2267725	All the songs are master tracks and contain their original music videos.
2267785	2269325	Rap songs work a little bit different.
2269565	2273246	I guess it's not just about the rhythm in the game.
2273326	2274646	It's kind of cool they have rap and singing.
2275206	2276327	I can't wait to rap.
2278687	2281368	Hopefully we can get Loki to rap and put it on YouTube somewhere.
2282328	2282428	No.
2284383	2284663	All right.
2285424	2286445	Are you excited about Lips?
2286766	2286966	No.
2287226	2287507	All right.
2288568	2290230	You're not a karaoke fan, right?
2290510	2290971	Not really.
2291331	2291572	All right.
2291592	2292232	Well, I'll buy it.
2292773	2293213	I'll admit it.
2293233	2293954	I like karaoke.
2294555	2298079	I'm just hoping that it reads on my ABBA CDs correctly.
2298099	2298440	Exactly.
2299912	2303034	Because if you can put in your own music, we're having ABBA night.
2303454	2313539	Well, what they should do is they should have it where you can plug in, you know, how they have the CDDB and stuff like that, where you can pop in CDs and it'll detect what songs it is and stuff like that.
2313900	2321904	If you could do that, say, with this game as well, MP3s, and it'll detect what song it is and automatically download the lyrics, that'd be pretty awesome.
2321964	2325286	We're going to reenact the Mamma Musical, or Mamma Mia Musical, right here.
2325686	2326146	It'll be fun.
2326827	2327087	All right.
2328028	2328709	Not on the air, though.
2329329	2330991	Listeners have done nothing to deserve that.
2331511	2337176	Hey, more details coming out of Microsoft's camp, including that big dashboard update that's been rumored.
2337196	2340959	There's going to be a huge dashboard update coming a little later this fall.
2341479	2348005	And apparently, some of the cool stuff that they're going to be putting in this dashboard update is Netflix integration.
2348365	2353349	If you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber and a Netflix subscriber, you can now use Netflix on your Xbox 360.
2354210	2359452	You can stream movies from your Netflix queue to your 360, which I think is kind of cool.
2360673	2364795	The thing is, though, only certain movies, the ones that they allow to be streamed on the internet, will do this.
2365335	2366616	Not in HD, sadly.
2367216	2374919	It's going to be SD only for now, but they say when Netflix is ready to do HD, Microsoft's ready to bring HD home.
2375179	2376560	So that's kind of interesting.
2378393	2380414	The big shock and awe avatars.
2380714	2382095	Oh, we didn't see anything of that coming.
2382135	2387237	But yeah, the avatars, which are kind of like the Mii ripoffs, but of course, you know, they want to do a little bit better.
2387557	2392740	So now not only do you have these avatars, but now you have these little like rooms that your avatars can go in.
2393240	2395121	It's not like home, but it kind of is.
2396161	2401942	It's not even really, I mean, because it's just like this big white room, kind of like the construct.
2402422	2410484	You can still use your gamer tags pictures, like if you have an Orange Lounge Radio gamer pic, because we actually have one on the marketplace, I don't know if you've seen it.
2411004	2419326	It's in community gamer pics too, but if you have like your OLR gamer pic, you can still use it, but they are going to kind of try to get people to switch over to avatars, which, yeah.
2420387	2423873	Games will now be able to give you Avatar Unlocks.
2424213	2427579	But that's not too much of a surprise when you consider games as it is can give you gamer picks.
2427659	2429261	It's just that a lot of games choose not to do it.
2429722	2430964	Now, I got a question for you.
2431044	2432367	Do you feel ripped off at all?
2432427	2432707	I mean...
2433829	2439672	I know you can use your themes with, I mean, but it's like in the background, like far background and stuff.
2439792	2441693	It's not quite as integrated as before.
2442093	2449177	But do you feel ripped off for buying, say, themes or gamer picks off of Xbox Live and now they're going to switch it all over to avatars?
2449517	2453779	Because you know they're just going to fucking sell clothing and shit for your avatars.
2454199	2456240	And that's how they're going to make even more money off that crap.
2456280	2456941	It's all Gaia.
2458605	2461008	I haven't bought any of that stuff in a while, so I'm okay.
2461048	2464112	Ever since the OLR gamer pick came out, I have no use for other gamer picks.
2464132	2470160	As far as themes go, not a lot of that stuff makes me actually want to go, ooh, I want to spend a dollar for that.
2470400	2472382	Because you can get custom themes off your PC.
2472442	2474024	As long as I can still do that, I'm down.
2474044	2475626	As long as I can still do that.
2476167	2476788	That's special.
2477293	2497029	Also, I want to point out real quick before we move on, another thing that was announced is Xbox Live Prime Time, and one specific thing that was announced is a version of 1 vs. 100, and this is actually something where they're going to have a live night where you can be a part of this game show thing using your avatars, and supposedly you're going to be able to win real prizes.
2497330	2502494	So you could be playing in your Xbox as one of the people in the mob in this 1 vs. 100 show.
2502634	2503174	That sounds fun.
2503214	2504535	That's kind of interesting.
2505036	2505176	Yeah.
2505616	2507678	It's a very casual gamer-friendly thing, too.
2508158	2510260	I can imagine whole families getting around to play this type of game.
2510280	2512102	Remember they used to have some sort of service like that?
2512122	2517947	I'm not sure if it's still around now where you could do that with TV shows and you'd actually be playing along with the live TV show.
2518427	2521129	Game Show Network does that on their website.
2521330	2522270	Not necessarily through that.
2522310	2523011	This actually was...
2525434	2528859	It reminds me of the old Berkeley Systems games on the PC.
2528960	2534849	I don't know if you guys ever played Acrophobia or... God, there was the other game with the tower in it.
2537042	2538442	And I apologize if you're hearing that noise.
2538462	2539303	I don't know what's causing that.
2539923	2541523	It sounds like a cell phone noise or something.
2541603	2543004	That's a cell phone interacting with speakers.
2543024	2544184	Okay, I don't think they got that on the show.
2544224	2544424	Sorry.
2544904	2545885	Whoa, hello, live radio.
2547285	2549085	But yeah, it reminds me of that.
2549146	2550786	Like that Berkeley System stuff back in the day.
2550806	2551946	I used to love those games.
2551986	2553307	Those game shows are so much fun.
2553847	2557308	So I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out on Xbox.
2557348	2561029	Hopefully it doesn't all crash the first night because you know that's something that is likely to happen.
2564036	2572299	Well, in other news, more stuff for Xbox Live Arcade is a present for us from the people who brought us Pac-Man Championship Edition.
2572839	2576921	It's called Galaga Legions, so it's very shiny and pretty.
2577581	2589505	And it's the same sort of redesigned, you know, same type of play that, you know, is trying to stick with the style, but trying to beef it up for the modern era.
2589625	2591026	So, it's shiny.
2593660	2594040	That's cool.
2594320	2599003	I mean, but again, it's going to be one of those things where you start to go, why did I buy the original Galaga when this is available now?
2599604	2603026	Well, the original Galaga came out in the 80s and you were probably five.
2604221	2605442	I know, I know, but still.
2605762	2609484	I don't know, this resembles more like Geometry Wars than Galaga.
2609864	2611585	It's definitely a lot more flashy.
2611605	2614686	It's kind of one of those things I want to get my hands on to see how it really works.
2614766	2619408	Yeah, because Pac-Man Championship Edition was only like half Pac-Man to me, you know what I mean?
2619448	2625191	There was a whole different strategy to it than in the regular Pac-Man, even though at first glance it looks the same.
2625651	2627492	I'm assuming Galaga will be similar, who knows.
2627932	2629613	I'm thinking it's going to follow that type of suit.
2629915	2630736	Yeah, most likely.
2645962	2648183	The DS, I know Rob is looking forward to this.
2648303	2651764	Final Fantasy 4, maybe it's way out.
2652084	2657266	Also on the DS this week, Azuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns.
2657386	2658766	And I know a lot of people like that one.
2660186	2665348	On DS as well, and I played a little bit of this a few weeks ago, New International Track and Field for the DS.
2666008	2674231	If you really want some frantic, I guess, stylus rubbing on there, that's going to be game for you.
2675151	2679014	Now, also on PC, a bunch of smaller titles here.
2679114	2687641	City Life 2008 Edition, Baseball Mogul 2009, Uber Soldier 2, The End of Hitler.
2688361	2689282	Awesome title there.
2691384	2692825	And let's see here on the DS.
2693025	2696708	Also, Nancy Drew, Mystery of the Cluebender Society.
2698489	2703693	On the Wii, we've got Kids Sports Crazy Golf.
2704522	2707086	Another Shovelware title from Destineer.
2708939	2712262	The Mummy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor on PS2, Wii, and DS.
2712963	2714965	Sadly enough, I think that's the biggest game this week.
2715745	2717247	And Order Up on the Wii.
2717547	2719128	Yet another Cookie Mama type game.
2720470	2728017	And finally, this I believe is on the Xbox Live Arcade and PS3, or PS Network.
2728997	2734643	We've got 1942 Joint Strike coming out on the arcade this week.
2736283	2736904	Final Fantasy 4 on the DS
2759120	2759901	Not really.
2759921	2761543	God, they have voice acting in it.
2761843	2763845	And you want to know one thing I learned from the voice acting?
2764125	2766787	I always thought the main character's name was Cecil.
2767408	2768388	That's what it looks like, right?
2768429	2768809	Cecil?
2769790	2772592	Cecil is apparently the name.
2773953	2775074	If you listen to the voice acting.
2775695	2781120	That makes sense because I don't think there's a C sound in Japanese.
2781260	2782741	I was just surprised a little bit.
2782921	2783722	I mean, you know.
2785074	2787695	All these years, I'm thinking one thing and it turns out it's the other.
2787735	2788596	It's just blowing your mind.
2788776	2790416	It's just blowing my mind, exactly.
2791037	2794278	Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the release dates that are going to be happening over there.
2795219	2800541	In fact, the entire Asia region is getting a version of WALL-E on the Xbox 360 this week.
2801181	2809245	But over in Japan specifically, Bully Scholarship Edition finally makes its way to Japan on July the 24th, as well as their local version of Guitar Hero 3 Legends of Rock.
2809705	2811587	It is the same song list, if you were wondering.
2811627	2813329	It is not a J-Rock song list.
2813789	2817072	If it was, I'd be importing that shit because that would be a lot of fun, I think.
2818113	2825080	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Kung Fu Panda, as well as the PlayStation 3 Eye Camera Pack.
2825120	2827422	I guess that's some type of new eye bundle.
2827882	2829003	Also, Siren.
2830465	2833327	Isn't that like the remake of the first Siren on PlayStation 3 or something?
2833728	2834569	New translation.
2835529	2837410	It's the episodic game now.
2837950	2838651	Ah, so there you have it.
2838671	2839791	That's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2840632	2842833	Wangen Midnight finally gets a price reduction.
2843113	2844734	Good, because they gave me blue ass.
2845902	2846623	Samurai Shodown
2868402	2872064	Yeah, some type of... No, what Samurai Shodown is over here.
2872304	2874626	Right, some type of compilation package it looks like.
2874726	2875166	That's cool.
2875486	2878148	Yeah, it's their version of Samurai Shodown Anthology.
2879228	2879848	So that's pretty cool.
2881029	2883410	Although I'm surprised they wouldn't just do that for Virtual Console.
2883631	2886072	Because they're releasing Yo-Yo games on Virtual Console now.
2886672	2893156	And I guess if there are people that will buy it... Especially if it's got all the way up through 5 and maybe the 64 versions, even though they were shitty.
2893678	2902282	A couple price reductions on PlayStation 2, including Biohazard 4, Resident Evil, Busou Orenken, Burnout Dominator, as well.
2902862	2912846	But coming out new on the PlayStation 2 this week, their own version of Bully's Scholarship Edition, as well as the Samurai Spirits Anthology Collection comes out in Japan this week as well.
2912886	2918329	Moving to the handhelds, the DS, you can get some new little sticky film things for your DS.
2918749	2920090	All for the Peanuts gang!
2920190	2920530	Hooray!
2920550	2922791	Because I guess the Peanuts are actually still really big in Japan.
2924992	2950081	Speed Racer comes out on the DS as well, Twilight Syndrome as well as SimCity DS gets a price reduction Kung Fu Panda gets another release over there on the DS and Kiraren Revolution Minna di Odoru Furifuri Debut comes out from Konami I'm thinking it says Revolution in the title so at first you think it might be a music game but no it's some other type of little action game that looks cutesy
2951940	2953601	Don't know a lot else about that game, sorry.
2954282	2959105	Checking out the PSP real quick, and then we'll call it a wrap for Japanese dates this week.
2959566	2972535	On the PSP, you get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, a price reduction, Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus, and, oh, too bad there isn't a plushie, Infinite Loop comes out as well.
2972555	2974017	Accent Core Plus would be funny.
2974257	2975558	It's all stuffed animals fighting.
2975678	2976258	Fighting each other.
2976278	2976919	That'd be awesome.
2977199	2978460	That's it for your Japanese release dates.
2979898	2981459	In the UK, just a few things.
2981559	2985702	On the 22nd, Izuna 2, The Unemployed Angel Returns on DS.
2985962	2989164	On the 23rd, 1942, Joint Strike on Xbox 360.
2989684	2991745	The same one to be out the next day on PlayStation 3.
2993166	2996988	25th, Buzz Master Quiz, Race Driver Grid on DS.
2998169	2999270	Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9.
2999590	3000890	I'm sorry, 11.
3001771	3002151	Shit.
3002231	3003852	God, I remember the first one.
3004733	3006494	Super Swing Golf on Wii.
3008416	3029353	Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9 is on PC wow cool alright well the next big conference that we had up during E3 was of course Nintendo and one announcement that they made was that they're going to be branching out from their normal games and bring us a sequel to eSports
3030370	3030711	Awesome.
3031332	3038282	Wii Sports Resort will be coming to the Wii, and it will be bundled with a brand new accessory that's called the Wii Motion Plus.
3038903	3045052	And what the Wii Motion Plus will do for your Wii Remote is allow you to actually have one, one...
3046334	3047475	and DarkSakura.com
3061994	3066897	It will be coming with one of those and all the other ones will cost you extra money.
3067077	3070420	I want to see... No, I haven't heard what the price of those were.
3070880	3072081	Something was $29.99.
3072161	3074122	Hopefully it wasn't the Wii Motion Plus things.
3074302	3076644	I'm curious how many games in the future will require this.
3077264	3077564	WeSportsResort
3096488	3099509	A jet ski racing game, which I forget what they actually call it.
3100409	3104349	Looks kind of like, I guess, I don't know.
3105150	3106190	A jet ski racing game.
3106770	3107230	It's kind of cool.
3107270	3108470	Wave Race 64, maybe.
3109490	3112911	And finally, they had sword fighting in there as well.
3113591	3114051	Cool!
3114371	3117252	But they made the swords look like lightsabers, sort of.
3117552	3119752	Oh my god, lightsabers!
3119772	3122072	They're giving everyone the Star Wars game they wanted.
3122613	3124833	Except it's not really lightsabers, it's just...
3126214	3152411	Big Paul Nerf Sabers Nerf Sabers sounds fun there may be up to 10 games in this pack whenever it's released it's not supposed to be out though until spring of next year so got some time for that you know what's funny though out of all the E3 predictions out there I would think that a sequel to Wii Sports getting announced would be like a so freaking obvious thing I didn't see a lot of people predict that
3153671	3157672	Well, here's my thing.
3158752	3164433	It makes sense for them business-wise because you have a problem where people are picking up the Wii and all they're playing is Wii Sports.
3164973	3172975	So if they want to sell games to this market that's not really buying games, well, their best bet would be to put a sequel out for Wii Sports.
3174355	3174795	I don't know.
3175395	3177596	It's definitely going to be selling very well.
3178746	3181710	I don't know if they're going to convince everybody that bought the Wii with Wii Sports.
3181730	3184194	It would sell better if they get that crap out by Christmas.
3184955	3185376	Yeah.
3185576	3186938	I'm kind of surprised it's not.
3187719	3188720	Well, I don't know.
3190142	3191364	It'll be interesting, I guess.
3191624	3193307	I'll have to check it out when it actually comes out.
3194858	3195038	Wii Music
3212076	3212357	Coji Kondo
3225222	3226723	That's alright, he didn't need to know that part.
3228004	3232027	But also, you know, you see, and you saw a little bit of this I think at the year's feature on.
3232267	3235490	Well apparently, 50 instruments are going to be included in this.
3235530	3237051	You use the remote, you use the nunchuck.
3237091	3241454	You can also tap your foot on the balance board to kind of simulate a drum set.
3242875	3245637	Apparently you're going to have violin, guitar, marimba.
3246317	3249019	I'm hoping there's a sitar in this, but nothing's been said about that yet.
3249039	3249420	I want a zither.
3250220	3251140	Or an auto-harp.
3274025	3278409	Which is kind of sad, in a way, because it's kind of like a good concept.
3278710	3280672	But it does sound like they took the game out of the game.
3281392	3283174	And now you have a noise-making device.
3283594	3284936	Well, here's the thing.
3285136	3285656	Here's the thing.
3285897	3293504	Miyamoto came up on stage and said, Who would have thought that we would have sold millions of bathroom scales?
3293744	3294465	And laughed at it.
3294925	3295186	You know?
3295646	3304834	and he laughed at it because you smug asshole and I don't really I'm not seeing that he's laughing at the people that are buying this stuff but
3306218	3307138	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3328846	3331128	This is exactly what you'll be buying with this game.
3331168	3336532	There's absolutely no way to play the song wrong because all you're doing is tapping buttons and pretending.
3336692	3337413	You know what's funny though?
3337693	3339154	I still think this game is going to be huge.
3339335	3341076	I think there is an audience for this game.
3341116	3342417	Yes, there is an audience.
3342557	3350864	It's the casual market that will buy these shitty Destiny games that come out because they look cool and they'll drop $20 on them and the games are absolute shit.
3351084	3357809	Miyamoto is a genius because, you know, us hardcore gamers, at least, you know, I'm looking at this going, where's the game?
3358369	3358890	Where's the game?
3359390	3360431	And they're going to sell millions.
3360971	3361371	Well, great.
3361572	3366715	You know, I'm glad that they're going to sell millions to this because, you know, they would sell millions of a good game as well.
3367496	3375381	And, you know, their loyal fans who buy all these games that come out each time are kind of disappointed.
3375582	3375862	I know.
3376122	3379685	I was, like, after watching the whole press conference from Nintendo, I'm like...
3380666	3381046	That was it?
3381647	3382768	That was a fucking waste of time.
3383028	3394017	I have to ask Jamie because she did say she was favorable to the orchestra thing when she saw it, but hearing that they've kind of taken the game out and now you've got a music simulation device, is this still interesting to you?
3394177	3395138	Yes, very much so.
3396939	3398140	Sorry, I was a music major.
3398220	3399001	I was in band.
3399441	3405186	I would love to get other people together who are likewise musically inclined and see what we can do.
3405526	3408649	I mean, I loved a lot of the MIDI sims that did that.
3408849	3411553	I worry, though, that this game isn't going to have that kind of depth.
3411834	3418343	Like, I would think, especially if you're going to get a bunch of music nerds together to do it, I would think that the game would need more depth, and I worry that this game is not going to have it.
3418403	3423752	I mean, prove me wrong, Nintendo, please do, but... Jamie, they said that there's no way to play this wrong.
3423932	3424112	I mean...
3424873	3426695	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3446072	3447393	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3475471	3475832	You know what?
3475872	3479854	You did hit on something good, though, is that if it gets more kids interested in music, then it's a good thing.
3481115	3482696	Because I was a band geek in school.
3482997	3487860	I would think that they would add in some sort of difficulty or control level, you know?
3488721	3491763	Add a little bit more freedom in what you're allowed to express with it.
3491883	3494345	I mean, that was what my thought was.
3495085	3497207	If there's a didgeridoo in the game, I'm sold, though.
3498168	3500289	I take back everything I said to play the didgeridoo.
3500549	3501170	Well, let's just...
3504963	3505944	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3528158	3529458	I don't really give a crap about this.
3529478	3530259	This looks stupid.
3530919	3536280	And sure enough, they come out on stage during the press conference now, and yeah, it was stupid.
3536340	3540262	Thank you for totally fulfilling my expectations on this piece of product.
3540282	3545363	And the other thing about having the one button control is if I'm right, you are the conductor also, right?
3546164	3548345	I think they have a conductor minigame in there.
3549225	3558727	As a conductor, though, I can understand having the one-button melody part playing as being conductor because it is the conductor's job to signal when the next part comes in by following along with the music.
3559367	3572490	So, you know, by reading the score, you have to signal to make sure that, first of all, even though the band is supposed to be keeping up with what's going on, they're supposed to know what you're doing, you still have to signal them, you still control volume, you know, keep the time.
3572910	3573950	They're going to follow you.
3574110	3576491	I would expect that that would make sense for a controller mode.
3577011	3578972	I just worry it's not going to have that kind of depth.
3579392	3581913	I think it's just going to be, hey, kid, waggle the thing in the air.
3581953	3582633	You're a conductor.
3582733	3583434	Whee!
3583514	3587195	They should have difficulty settings to allow for a broader market to play it.
3587639	3590160	But there's nothing, there's no on-screen cues, there's nothing.
3590220	3597003	It's literally, there's a little drum beat going along and you decide whether you want to tap your thing with the song or whatever.
3597723	3602985	What they should have done, and this could have opened it up for the entire market instead of just... See, that's the problem.
3603085	3604926	They can't just develop for everybody.
3605266	3608147	They just want to either develop for the casual market or the hardcore market.
3608187	3611268	They can't see past developing something that would appeal to both.
3611786	3612106	DarkSakura.com
3630239	3630859	And do it that way.
3630939	3634401	And then if you're not interested in that, that's too complex for you.
3634441	3636902	You can sit there and tap your finger to the music or whatever.
3637162	3640143	Well, we need to move on, but I will still close with this.
3640263	3642424	I don't care if the game is a piece of flaming poo.
3642584	3650507	If it gets five-year-olds saying, hey, I want to play a real marimba someday or I want to play a real saxophone, French horn, whatever, then it's a good thing.
3651167	3651587	So we'll see.
3651687	3653708	I like that you said saxophone and French horn together.
3654288	3656129	Because they have very complimentary tones.
3656429	3660271	I pulled instruments out of my ass that I remember from marching band.
3660571	3663172	You know what game, though, I think they should make that would be a good music game?
3663212	3663592	What's that?
3663832	3664812	You know what a theremin is?
3666513	3666693	No.
3667153	3669934	It uses analog wave signals to play music.
3670054	3673336	Like, it's got one that goes out vertically and one that goes up horizontally.
3673756	3676537	And you use your hands in between the waves.
3676557	3676897	Oh.
3677880	3679601	Oh, okay, I've seen that, yes.
3679681	3681783	You control the music that you play.
3681883	3684564	One of them is your volume, and the other one is your pitch.
3685585	3692269	And you can wiggle your fingers a certain way, and it'll do staccato, or do it slowly, it'll be more flowing.
3692910	3695231	But they should do a game that mimics a theremin.
3695471	3696112	Wouldn't that be cool?
3697312	3700774	I gotta get some comments from chat, because you know they're commenting on it.
3701015	3702736	GS68 says, I want Wee Cowbell.
3704234	3705474	They have the cowbell in there.
3706515	3707036	I'm serious.
3707156	3707816	I'm getting it.
3707836	3708697	It has a cowbell.
3709057	3718804	PKJr92 says, Rob, how would you play a didgeridoo with a Wiimote?
3719525	3719885	I don't know.
3719905	3721486	How are you going to play all this other shit with a Wiimote?
3721506	3722127	They'll make it work.
3722167	3722827	It's Nintendo.
3723568	3725089	They create miracles every day.
3725669	3728071	Frisbee says, but those kids aren't going to do that, Rob.
3728671	3729372	I bet you're wrong.
3729632	3733416	They say more people are taking guitar lessons because of Guitar Hero, trying to learn how to play the real thing.
3734417	3737441	I know what you're thinking, Debbie Downer, but I bet you're going to be wrong.
3737661	3745949	Not to be all pessimistic or anything, but seriously, if you're really excited about Wii Music and you haven't watched the conference yet...
3746830	3752474	I urge you to at least watch that portion of the Nintendo press conference because you will be disappointed.
3752955	3755897	I mean, literally, it's just like, ouch.
3756377	3757638	Alright, new game.
3757738	3758439	New Nintendo game.
3758539	3758819	Please.
3758919	3759399	Stuff.
3760740	3764203	The game called Nintendo Does Shit is coming out.
3764383	3764903	No, I'm kidding.
3765664	3767805	And Nintendo does shit all over your wallet.
3767845	3768426	It's amazing.
3768959	3769980	No, it prints money.
3771080	3790390	This is, though, the happy news, I think, of E3 for a lot of Nintendo fans, is Animal Crossing City Folk, which will be, I mean, basically it's the same sort of graphical style that we know way back in the Nintendo 64 era of Doubutsu no Mori, you know, because that was the first version that came out was on Nintendo 64.
3790610	3792571	In other words, they added widescreen and that's it.
3793071	3793551	Pretty much.
3794452	3794532	Um...
3796386	3805451	But the neat thing about this one is that you can use your Wii message board to send messages to your friends, and you can put on masks that look like you're me.
3806212	3806832	That'd be cool.
3808173	3809934	Especially for whoever gets Goat Say Me.
3809954	3811835	Hooray.
3812735	3819299	There is also a microphone option that's called Wii Speak, so you can talk to other players around the world.
3820800	3823521	And it's just pretty cool.
3825022	3825102	Cool.
3827219	3828199	I don't know what to think about this.
3828239	3828860	I'm excited.
3828900	3829560	I'm going to buy it.
3829940	3830320	Getting it.
3830421	3831421	Granted, I'm getting it.
3831641	3834423	I have to be able to send nasty messages to villagers everywhere.
3834523	3837024	I hope it's one of those things where it works a little better in theory.
3837305	3842828	Because the problem with Animal Crossing DS, the problem with that is that... There's no island!
3843408	3844148	Well, not just that.
3844188	3851471	You had to coordinate with people in order to be able to visit their village, which granted was a step up from the GameCube one where they had to actually be at your house.
3851891	3860535	But I think that's kind of why the DS one lost its charm is they really didn't add that much from the GameCube one and you kind of had to do all this coordination.
3860975	3868298	I am hoping in this one that it uses that WeConnect24 for a good thing where I can go to people's villages in the middle of the night and steal their fruit.
3870523	3876208	Plus, I'm hearing they took the whole... Like, you know how there was like a game in it?
3876528	3880571	Is it the game, in a sense, is to pay back Tom Nook for your house, right?
3880932	3882193	I'm hearing they took that out.
3882713	3884795	That there is no game now in Animal Crossing.
3884835	3886436	It's just do stuff.
3886817	3887497	No, no, no, no.
3887537	3888358	They can't take that out.
3888418	3892701	But I'm thinking since it says City Folk, maybe it's going to be a much...
3893612	3895353	That is sort of very Japanese, isn't it?
3915760	3916060	in a way.
3916341	3923609	It's also kind of lame though, I mean, and I hate to put the specific spin on everything, but here's what they basically did with the city portion.
3923629	3932019	The city portion, remember how there was little events that would happen at specific times during the week where you would have, I forget the bitch's name, they'd come and try to sell you the expensive...
3932339	3932779	Sahara?
3933019	3933760	Yeah, Sahara.
3933800	3935460	She would sell you the expensive clothing.
3935781	3937501	She sold the carpets, I'm sorry.
3937521	3938302	The carpets, okay.
3938702	3941063	They had the other people that would sell the expensive clothing.
3941103	3944705	They had the people that would sell the rare furniture and stuff like that.
3945145	3945705	Well, guess what?
3945765	3948466	Now you don't have to worry about going to your town specific days.
3948486	3951108	You just go to the city and it's all there.
3951128	3952708	I mean, what's the point?
3952808	3956350	I mean, the whole point is you go back to your town and actually be able to play it and stuff.
3956827	3957308	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3978271	3982579	Have special festivals, have a carnival maybe, something that happens in your town.
3982939	3987007	They have very limited objects that you can maybe get like once a month or something.
3987027	3991515	You know, and this wouldn't be a big surprise for me, but I honestly don't think there's going to be...
3992878	4000760	There will be hardly any innovation from the GameCube version, let alone the DS version with this version.
4000940	4005501	They're literally pumping out the same fucking game on every system so far.
4005601	4008242	I did get the impression this game's kind of already in the can.
4008462	4010462	That this game's just waiting to be released already.
4010482	4018044	And, you know, it's not a bad... I mean, the game's good, it's fun, and you'll play it for a while, and then you'll get bored of it like all the other ones, but...
4019830	4021351	It's like they're not even trying.
4021391	4023451	It's like, okay, we put out the same game again.
4023791	4024512	People will buy it.
4024552	4025332	Let's release it.
4025432	4028353	I would like to see more things that you have to accomplish with other people.
4028453	4029293	I think that would be great.
4029393	4033955	Like you have to do, like in order to get super rare things, you have to work with somebody else.
4033975	4036816	I mean, because it would give this whole we speak thing a use.
4036836	4038897	Because right now this thing is screaming gimmick.
4038937	4039797	Maybe you have a job.
4041052	4042833	GameGuru says a carnival was confirmed for City Folk.
4067310	4068071	So that's kind of cool.
4068371	4070992	Frisbee says there better be a freak show in the carnival.
4071973	4072753	That would be awesome.
4072773	4077416	I want to have the bearded lady move to my village.
4077696	4081999	I want more than four characters in my village, which would be nice.
4082199	4087022	I also want, say when you're not playing your characters, that they walk around and do stuff, which would be also cool.
4087042	4092005	I also want to be able to put the Mii masks on the other villagers that are in there in case I don't like their ugly face.
4092686	4096008	Joshi16 says Animal Crossing is the new Harvest Moon.
4097037	4105068	If you have some comments you want to have read on air, chat.orangesoundtrader.com when we chat live on these Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific time at allgames.com.
4108285	4121309	Well, something that, the only thing during the Nintendo press conference that had me excited that this conference actually might turn around was the brief announcement that Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was coming to the DS.
4122349	4128271	And that is exactly all we know about it, other than it will take place during Liberty City, and...
4129574	4141907	yeah, it's being worked on no word other than that what exactly this is but I'm excited because it's Grand Theft Auto and then immediately the conference turned around and went back to shit again
4144244	4144624	PSP PSP PSP
4164761	4165041	We'll see.
4165241	4165521	I don't know.
4191371	4192412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4208488	4235738	The rumored prices right now $2.99 for a standard definition rental $6 for a high definition download $14.99 if you want to actually purchase the movie No idea yet about high definition pricing Apparently the store went up right after the conference and you can get such movies as Rambo, Cloverfield, The Bank Job All right there That's cool they needed that But here's a tip Don't get Cloverfield on HD There's no point
4236977	4238978	They don't sell the movies in HD yet.
4239658	4240338	Oh, okay, not yet.
4241539	4242019	But soon.
4242979	4245460	Soon is the all-encompassing word for us, isn't it?
4246600	4255984	Well, something else regarding the Wii and what Nintendo's got released is the Wii Speak microphone.
4257225	4261010	You know, which they brought up the We Speak with Animal Crossing.
4261630	4264554	But it's called a community microphone.
4265135	4274888	And it's supposed to sit on top of your infrared bar on top of the TV and bring up basically everything in the room from what I understand.
4276428	4280470	Hooray, so now everybody in my house can hear the obscenities people are shouting at me on the internet.
4280490	4283171	Well, it's like a conference phone type of thing.
4283871	4284711	We'll see, we'll see.
4284971	4288593	It's an interesting departure from the traditional headset thing, I'll give them that.
4288933	4289973	I do like that, though.
4290053	4290693	But I don't know.
4290914	4291854	I hate wearing headsets.
4291914	4296316	It's not the device that I'm worried about, it's the implementation of it.
4296616	4297276	That's the thing.
4298476	4299977	At least it's not a camera.
4301237	4301858	I'll give you that.
4302838	4303298	I'll give you that.
4303838	4305079	I don't want a camera on my Wii.
4305646	4309872	Well, also, though, some other interesting news was...
4311733	4328938	that especially regarding Sony is that they have released information saying that there will be a $399 80 gig PS3 available in September and labeled as the 80 gigabyte core pack.
4330158	4340781	That actually sounds kind of neat but it's definitely the price drop from the $499 bundle that currently has the 80 gigabyte system.
4342435	4343576	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4360794	4363096	and the PS3 is getting the same thing.
4363116	4368302	You're going to have the 399 core system, the 80 gig, which, by the way, does not play any PlayStation 2 games at all.
4368322	4370664	It has the same backwards compatibility as the 40 gig system.
4370684	4376471	That's what I was about to say, actually, before you jumped in on what I was saying.
4378052	4381356	But hey, 40 gig system with a larger hard drive, so that's awesome.
4384033	4389996	I guess though, having the 80 gig, if you're going to announce this movie thing, I mean, I guess that's what you're going to need the space for, right?
4390396	4393958	If you're going to download all these movies, then they want you to have the bigger hard drive, right?
4394278	4396439	So in the end, they win, right?
4398300	4407305	It makes it a lot more simplified, because if they just leave it at the 80 gig system, you can just do, okay, the PS3 system is $399, if you want this bundle, it's $499.
4407405	4411987	But it kind of devalues the bundle a bit.
4413604	4414205	God of War 3
4433513	4434274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4451019	4451380	All right.
4451960	4457808	Well, not only did Sony... Actually, I would probably go with the latest because they always seem to delay their releases of stuff.
4458649	4465657	Well, not only did Sony announce the obvious, which I would say is God of War 3, but they announced something a little bit unexpected, I think.
4466298	4469362	It has to do with what's a new type of game they're calling a MAG.
4469882	4471383	A massive action game.
4471403	4474586	You know how an MMO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game?
4474886	4477508	Well, this is supposed to be like that, but with an action game.
4477848	4480931	Apparently, 256 players.
4481391	4483953	Are there that many people playing online with the PS3 right now?
4484953	4486133	I don't know, probably.
4486413	4489394	256 players can actually all play this game at once.
4489794	4492855	It's just apparently this giant free-for-all type game.
4493515	4495856	You can get live statistics actually as you're playing.
4496216	4502398	It does look like a war kind of game and seeing as it is being developed by the folks who make SOCOM, it does make sense.
4502698	4504798	It's eight player squads is what you're in.
4505459	4506299	It's kind of interesting.
4507643	4513049	It's kind of an expansion, I guess, on the 64-player multiplayer for Resistance 2.
4513410	4515712	We're in squads on that as well.
4515993	4523481	I said a long time ago on this show, and I'm sure other people have too, we have these massively multiplayer role-playing games.
4523541	4525763	Where's our massively multiplayer other types of games?
4525863	4526604	And here you go.
4526704	4528827	Well, they had Huxley that was supposed to be coming out.
4530598	4534300	I don't know.
4535221	4537242	See, that's good, though, that they announced something like that.
4537262	4539543	Because that's something that Microsoft doesn't have.
4539583	4541684	That's something that can differentiate themselves.
4542504	4543865	But, I don't know.
4545008	4550572	Home is still coming and it supposedly looks a little bit better from what I saw at the press conference thing.
4550812	4560479	Well, Loki's going to sum up some other E3 highlights for us, but first I just kind of want to go around and get everybody's highlights and lowlights from the press conferences.
4560900	4564042	Best announcement you heard and worst announcement you heard.
4564602	4564902	Loki.
4566043	4568905	The worst announcement I heard was the entire lineup from Nintendo.
4569866	4571967	Seriously, that press conference was hard to watch.
4572148	4572208	It
4573399	4574440	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4603296	4617302	um least exciting thing for me is that little motion extra device thing on the Wii because it's just now another piece of crap I'm gonna have to buy because other games are gonna have to implement this because it probably should have been in there in the first place most exciting thing
4620629	4621530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4638760	4642022	A genuine surprise and something that sounds pretty exciting and different.
4642943	4645745	And reminds me of the whole Berkeley Systems days.
4646025	4648327	So I'm going to say that's the most exciting thing I heard in those press conferences.
4649748	4652270	Loki, any other things from the big three we might have missed?
4652650	4654612	Okay, starting off here.
4654932	4657274	There was some Xbox Live Arcade announcements.
4657334	4658815	Quite a few of them, actually.
4659836	4661217	Some surprising stuff, too.
4661317	4665140	They were, of course, showing off Banjo-Kazooie 3 Nuts and Bolts.
4666061	4674998	Well, another announcement that they made along with that is that the original Banzu Kazooie will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade later this year, which is surprising because that was an Nintendo 64 game.
4677688	4678549	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4703163	4705945	Castle Crashers, Galaga Legions, Braid, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2,
4728829	4734493	All going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade within the next four to six weeks.
4735673	4736714	That's fucking awesome.
4739376	4742858	Other things, Halo Wars is supposed to be out the first half of 2009.
4743158	4744239	It looked kind of cool.
4746720	4748722	There was some other stuff...
4750560	4753080	Let's see here.
4754221	4760282	Actually, I want to say that August 6th is when Geometry Wars 2 is going to be coming out, so that's pretty cool.
4761942	4766363	Not really part of the press conference, but Apogee came back.
4767503	4768043	Remember them?
4768183	4769343	They used to do shareware games.
4769383	4770744	Yes, they were awesome.
4770844	4771864	Isn't that pronounced Apogee?
4772004	4772724	I think it is Apogee.
4773024	4774344	Jill of the Jungle, like what?
4776305	4778365	Well, they're bringing Duke Nukem to the handhelds.
4779110	4781076	Which made me ask, where the fuck's Dick Dinkum Forever?
4781738	4782160	Bastards.
4783263	4784708	But, that was interesting.
4787278	4790339	They showed off a Resistance Fall of Man PSP game.
4790599	4791839	That's due out spring of 2009.
4792339	4796560	It's going to be kind of like the Killzone PSP game, so that's kind of interesting.
4797840	4802381	And this is going to make you very happy, Rob, actually.
4803821	4804581	Well, not really.
4805361	4812142	There's rumors that that MotionPlus controller add-on that they're going to have, yeah, eventually it's going to be integrated into the Wii Remote.
4812363	4812743	Shock.
4813103	4814503	So yeah, all that money wasted.
4815183	4817344	for stuff that should have been there in the first place.
4818004	4819525	I just glanced at Justin.TV.
4819865	4820725	I forgot about this one.
4820765	4822706	Did you see the Sony game Fat Princess?
4823486	4826547	Farmboy44 in the Justin.TV chat says that.
4826607	4828148	That game looks hilarious.
4829548	4831689	That does look funny.
4833770	4839852	And then I want to say that... I'm trying to think what else that was really cool coming out of there.
4840919	4848618	I don't know, some of the gameplay stuff that they're showing off, like Resident Evil 5 looked kind of neat with the co-op and stuff that they announced that you can do there.
4849460	4849981	And, um...
4852395	4852755	I don't know.
4852795	4854637	The PlayStation Home stuff looked alright.
4854797	4864946	The one cool thing that really impressed me, though, about the PlayStation conference was that they showed off... Actually, part of their presentation was done in LittleBigPlanet.
4865567	4866348	And it was really cool.
4866368	4866888	That was cool.
4867268	4868029	I saw a little bit of that.
4868049	4868430	That's neat.
4868610	4871192	See, that's how you make their conferences interesting, okay?
4871472	4873214	That game has me absolutely excited.
4873274	4874055	Can't wait to play that.
4874795	4876156	October for that one, at least.
4876937	4877077	And...
4879229	4881630	I wanna say that was pretty much it.
4881790	4889133	There was really, you know, no big game announcements as far as, like, DS stuff, I think.
4889653	4895095	I mean, everyone was expecting, like, I think they announced a new Pokemon Rangers game, which is just whoop-de-doo.
4896516	4899597	No Pokemon Platinum announcement, even though we know that's coming.
4900357	4906640	But, you know, once again, Nintendo said that this E3 conference was not about the core gamers, it was about casual gamers, which...
4908803	4909443	and DarkSakura.
4934028	4938531	If we didn't take a minute to pay some respect to our elders in gaming.
4938671	4944034	And DarkSakura, having gone to California Extreme, I'm sure must have been inspired from hundreds of games this week.
4944474	4945915	I actually didn't see this one there, though.
4946235	4946555	Wow.
4946935	4948156	I was a little disappointed.
4948416	4948676	Huh.
4948896	4949276	All right.
4949337	4956340	So we have something completely, I guess, outside of the realm of what you saw.
4956420	4958642	Just something you were hoping and thinking about this week.
4958702	4960463	So it must be pretty darn good.
4960843	4961483	Let's take a look.
4961523	4962604	It's the classic game of the week.
4963820	4965160	What should the kids be playing this week?
4965920	4976643	The game of the week is Kicks, which is one of my all-time, all-time favorite games ever, which became also the model for later stuff like Galactica.
4976663	4977263	Hell yeah!
4977363	4977663	Woo!
4979023	4980663	You hear the sounds?
4980703	4981944	This is what you got when you played.
4983344	4989765	It was this little vector series of lines that would move across an empty rectangular space, and you were a dot.
4990945	4993366	It's like Attack of the Windows screensavers.
4994971	5000196	And what you had to do is box in to gain a super majority of the screen.
5000937	5008844	So you also had these little spark things though that would travel on your lines that you would form to box in the kicks.
5009805	5014006	and, um, it would, uh, if it hit you, it would destroy you.
5014126	5019668	Also, if the kicks hit the line that you were drawing, it would also destroy you, and you did have a timer, too.
5020308	5027250	So, your whole, um, the whole point of the game was to claim, um, a certain percentage of the screen.
5028131	5028211	Um...
5031483	5038389	I've actually managed to get the 95 percentile closure on the screen before just by making a trap box.
5038609	5041091	It requires some pretty good strategy to do well.
5043133	5044814	But there's also a...
5047799	5049801	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5068118	5081603	Also, as you progress through the game, you would actually get two kicks on the screen, which you could actually easily pass the level if you could bisect the screen so that one was on either side.
5083123	5085784	It really is a lot harder than it sounds.
5085804	5092606	It's a very difficult game past the first couple of stages, but it's one of my all-time favorites.
5092886	5093427	It really is.
5093727	5094567	It's pretty awesome.
5094587	5096047	Have you ever played Super Kicks?
5097028	5097448	No, I've not.
5098103	5099104	They have it available on MAME.
5099124	5100284	That's the only way I've played it.
5100304	5101725	A little more graphics in it.
5102465	5103146	But kind of fun.
5103486	5110010	The versions of Kicks that I have is the Atari 5200 version and the Nintendo version of Kicks.
5111090	5111831	Alright.
5111951	5116013	It's really so simple and very frustrating.
5116033	5117974	I'm going to beat these stupid lines into a circle.
5120011	5125595	Yeah, I remember in Super Kicks you'd get letters that you would actually unveil if you siphoned off certain parts of the screen.
5125715	5126435	It's kind of interesting.
5126695	5137243	But in the way that this, though, has been incorporated into, like, Gals Panic is, you know, uncovering certain portions of the screen instead of, you know, covering them with your blocks.
5137543	5140605	And you get to see some boobies if you uncover the right part of the screen.
5141005	5142426	Like in Miss World 96 Nude.
5143187	5143407	Yes.
5143487	5145008	Which you know is a OLR favorite.
5145768	5146028	Yes.
5147910	5148210	All right.
5148996	5150699	No, but the old school kicks is pretty awesome.
5152081	5152422	All right.
5154176	5156097	One other thing.
5156517	5170140	The versions that are out, by the way, is Atari 5200, Commodore 64, DOS, Amiga, which is graphically enhanced, Apple IIGS, Game Boy.
5170580	5172601	I actually do have the Game Boy version now that I'm thinking about it.
5173341	5174841	NES and Atari Lynx.
5175202	5180023	There was a port for the Game Boy Color that was called Kix Adventure.
5181786	5185952	I don't know if you're saying that it's on GameTap right now.
5186854	5193083	And you can also find it emulated on multiple systems and get Taito Legends 2 and Taito Legends Power-Up on PSP.
5194241	5196262	Actdeft says, Kicks for Xbox Live Arcade.
5196682	5197342	Dude, yes.
5197522	5199043	But you were mentioning Super Kicks.
5199843	5204085	There's Kicks 2 Tournament in 1982 and Super Kicks that you were talking about.
5204465	5209447	And there's Twin Kicks that was a prototype as of 1995 that never came out.
5209507	5214069	However, there is a main release that you can play.
5214169	5219731	And then there was Volfield, but it was Ultimate Kicks Neo on PlayStation 4.
5220491	5222412	So there's also, of course, cell phone versions.
5222572	5226494	And as I was saying before, Gal's Panic was also based off of Kix.
5226574	5228955	It's almost a dead clone of it, except for boobs.
5230496	5234137	Capcoma Night in Busyland, which was on SNES.
5234758	5240120	Jezball Sonics, Eric's Stix, Ultimate Kix.
5241661	5243342	There's actually a minigame version in Bully.
5244082	5248144	And Stix Reloaded, which was a freeware version, were all knockoffs of Kix.
5249810	5251451	So plenty of ways to get your kicks on.
5251931	5252172	Yeah.
5252592	5252932	All right.
5253613	5256494	Well, that's going to do it for this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5256534	5259336	We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5259356	5263839	And if you're listening on the podcast, that means just let it keep playing because we're going to take a quick commercial break.
5264380	5268642	Actually, we're calling them not commercial breaks because they're just not paid stuff.
5269163	5270303	I want to say with that, too.
5270984	5274126	Well, I'll explain at the beginning of part B. We're accepting your contributions for this.
5274146	5275327	So what's the antonym of commercial?
5276127	5276688	I'm not sure.
5276968	5277788	Public service announcement?
5277808	5278109	Anti-commercial?
5278129	5278569	Anti-commercial?
5279767	5280347	Non-commercial?
5280827	5282808	They're non-commercial breaks.
5283048	5284568	Yes, they're indie commercial breaks.
5284628	5284948	I don't know.
5286029	5288449	Commercial means pretty much something for money, right?
5288489	5289390	They're free breaks.
5289670	5290270	Free breaks!
5290330	5291590	Yes, we're going to take a free break.
5291630	5291910	There we go.
5291930	5292810	We're going to take a free break.
5293731	5296051	Just to explain really quickly, it's probably the only time I'm going to mention that.
5296071	5298412	For those of you on the podcast, you will only hear our original...
5299292	5300553	and the promos on the free break.
5301034	5310340	For those of you that are listening live tonight, you're going to hear a song or two as well because we actually need to take a stretch break, get some water and all that good stuff so you get a little bit longer when you're listening live.
5310900	5313702	But we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5318548	5319489	DarkSakura.com
5335968	5340791	Elf needs food badly, so please, think twice before shooting food this holiday season.
5341311	5349236	The Blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault!
5349817	5352198	Remember, don't shoot food.
5359162	5364686	From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes...
5365693	5368562	Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd Mix
5370663	5381428	That's right, the highly anticipated sequel to the community-created hit using the DDR simulation program StepMedia is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, animal-pissing, ocean-pissing new songs danced in.
5381768	5389952	You'll play all new theme courses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts.
5390832	5394634	When you call my name, it's like a little home prayer.
5394894	5396695	I'm down on my knees.
5397319	5398640	I'm staying in.
5399681	5403885	I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.
5404085	5404926	DarkSakura?
5406187	5415956	Please note, there are no real songs sung by DarkSakura because it would lead to the entire Orange Lunge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a bonfire on an ocean of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano.
5416196	5416517	Sorry.
5416577	5419780	You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan.
5420120	5423403	Don't get strung out by the way I look.
5424531	5427134	Don't judge a book by its cover.
5427154	5428495	John DMN Bressler.
5428815	5429916	You ever go to Duck Island?
5430997	5432278	Your mom goes to Duck Island.
5433820	5439545	And a ton of license music inspired by the show that the RIAA and Laura Steele UT don't want you to hear.
5439810	5445072	Gaming community is fine, but there's no need to promote this cancer, and you might as well just offer torrents on the website.
5445172	5448473	So come, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution 2nd.
5448593	5453315	When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplay.com.
5453455	5459837	It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck.
5460037	5461478	But I poop from there.
5463300	5465142	And it's only from the Nintendo Wii.
5465482	5473189	So come on down to your local participating Liberty City game store, split a WorldCorp breach, bring your ferret, and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
5473490	5475532	If you do, Loki might dress up as Tim.
5475692	5476833	Not a guarantee.
5478134	5483119	Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice.
5483547	5487449	Because the army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing.
5487810	5493333	To get the snipers prepared psychologically to be willing to kill as snipers.
5493633	5495214	Well, except that asshole.
5496035	5498276	And now back to Orange Lounge Radio.
5498997	5507962	There's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and teenagers.
5509683	5510464	Someone get the hook.
5510584	5512305	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5513874	5515777	This lovely July 20th, 2008.
5516578	5518581	Jamie has a very perplexed look on her face.
5518601	5519823	It looks like she swallowed a fly.
5520023	5520724	I'm twitching.
5521185	5522026	I hope she won't die.
5524582	5525082	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5547003	5548864	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
5576908	5577568	Rob can count.
5577808	5578308	I can.
5578389	5578849	I'm a winner.
5578929	5582851	Alright, more news from E3 that didn't necessarily directly have to do with the press conference.
5582891	5584592	Loki, start us off.
5584732	5585933	There was an announcement.
5586053	5589816	I don't know why they decided to cut this because it's... I don't know.
5589836	5593938	It seems kind of no-brainer to me that I would announce this during an E3 press conference.
5594458	5598861	There was a new Halo game that they were going to be announcing, but we didn't have time.
5599922	5601183	That was literally the excuse.
5601263	5602283	We didn't have time.
5602303	5602343	Um...
5606537	5608018	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5632301	5633101	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5654525	5659306	I think they should do a new Halo game based off of Red vs. Blue, which would be fucking awesome.
5659326	5659866	There you go.
5660106	5665307	Alright, so in all seriousness, a Halo announcement gets pulled for time.
5666468	5667208	Wow, what the heck?
5667428	5669088	Did they maybe just not have enough to go off of?
5669128	5670929	Maybe this game is just way too early in development?
5671289	5672609	Are they sitting on it for PAX?
5673009	5678731	Are they waiting for the giant orgasm that will fill the Seattle Convention Center when that's announced?
5678751	5680591	Do I smell Omegathon?
5682029	5683370	Well, it might be a little early for that.
5683390	5684030	I don't know about that.
5686451	5687792	Dude, we get to watch a Megathon this year.
5687812	5689613	That's going to be kind of rad.
5689633	5692314	We'll have to sign up for a Megathon if we can.
5692434	5692854	You can't.
5693294	5695515	It's randomly chosen out of people that pre-register.
5695675	5695995	Damn it.
5696736	5701298	And I think if we did get in as press... Yeah, we probably wouldn't get to do that.
5701478	5705740	But if we don't get in as press, then that's disappointing.
5706640	5708221	Because even they have denied us.
5709847	5715329	Well, look, anyhow, so maybe this Halo game is just being waited on until later, but when later is, who knows?
5715369	5718330	Maybe they'll just sit on it until next year when there's actually more game to show.
5718670	5721791	Because even if they did announce it, I'm sure it's not a game coming out until 2010.
5722451	5722771	We'll see.
5723352	5726193	A game we had no idea was coming out here at Orange Launch Radio.
5726253	5729434	This completely took me by surprise that E3 was Dead Rising for the Wii.
5729794	5732755	I don't know about you guys, but I was just, like, floored by this announcement.
5733075	5733195	What?
5733235	5733995	I've never heard of this before.
5734015	5734856	Dead Rising for the Wii?
5734976	5735296	I know.
5735416	5736836	That's just insane.
5736976	5737257	All right.
5737617	5738237	That's such an...
5739534	5740775	I had never heard that on this show.
5756131	5761255	Now you're going to have sub-missions that you beat in the game, and then you'll do a major plotline quest.
5761595	5763716	So now the game has become a little more linear.
5764497	5769600	But some people actually think that might be a good thing, because some people thought the 360, the way it was done there, was a little bit frustrating.
5770541	5777926	The camera apparently has now been changed, and now it's a behind-and-above type view, more like what they had in Resident Evil 4.
5778326	5780808	So now it's kind of like one of those over-the-shoulder things.
5781708	5785591	And the photo mode is now gone, so you can't take the pictures.
5786691	5788072	I won't miss it.
5788252	5789352	It was a little silly anyway.
5789552	5790193	It was fun for a minute.
5790233	5793314	As long as you can still run over zombies with a lawnmower, I'm happy.
5793994	5796615	That's really all you need to make Dead Rising.
5796635	5801096	And please God, save the save system.
5801256	5802977	No, fix the save system.
5804022	5804382	Please.
5805063	5807305	Dead Rising Wii coming out soon.
5808326	5809987	And by soon he means January.
5812449	5820215	Well, you know, and I remember Bobby actually mentioning this on his show earlier, but there's some higher-ups that hate E3.
5821276	5822677	Hate it, hate it, hate it the way it is.
5822717	5826841	I like to consider myself one of those higher-ups, but apparently I'm the only one that does that.
5828143	5833887	Well, it was actually stated by the EA big guy.
5834788	5836569	Okay, now I'm going to totally butcher his last name.
5836589	5837490	His first name is John.
5838131	5841013	It's Riccitello, I think.
5841693	5842034	Whatever.
5842574	5845977	Anyway, he's quoted as saying, I hate E3 like this.
5846497	5849900	And that they want to go back to the old E3 or do their own private events.
5850100	5856344	And the Ubisoft director, well, the Ubisoft boss said, yeah, it was terrible.
5856365	5857005	Yeah.
5857165	5859426	In fact, to quote him, he said, E3 this year was terrible.
5860266	5863827	The world used to come to E3, now it's like Pipefitter's show in the basement.
5865348	5876412	Funny that the EA guy would be complaining, seeing as, well, EA was one of the four major companies that approached the ESA and said, we want you to change E3 because we don't like it the way it is.
5876732	5877752	They're never satisfied.
5878572	5879353	They don't know what they want.
5879393	5880173	They're like little kids.
5881287	5898036	Well, there was, it actually was Ubisoft, someone from Ubisoft named Alain Cor was also, you know, saying that he didn't really care for it all that either too.
5899597	5904720	But one of the things that I think should be pointed out is that
5906497	5912441	While they were the ones that wanted it, I think they didn't expect it to turn out the way that it did.
5913742	5922729	I think that it was such a drastic departure that they are just now beginning to see to them what would be a detriment.
5923789	5935758	One thing that I think was pointed out by Corey is that he's saying it's one milestone in the communication of your products throughout the year and it's important because it's the ramp on for Christmas.
5937668	5941310	But he had said that in mid-July, that wouldn't be something appropriate.
5941390	5946432	Now, what I'm thinking is that if they wanted their big event, they should do something closer to the end of the year.
5947412	5956836	You know, have E3 be your meetings and everything, and then do E3 to the sequel in November or something.
5957156	5958877	Which is what E4ALL was supposed to be.
5959117	5960698	But people didn't see it that way.
5960738	5963819	It should still be the same E3, I think.
5963959	5965360	The same format as before.
5965380	5965460	Yeah.
5965959	5969141	EA still kind of strikes me as the Goldilocks of the game industry right now.
5969241	5971102	This convention is too big.
5971603	5973364	This convention is too small.
5974064	5976126	They're looking for a convention that's just right.
5977527	5979348	But, you know, I don't know.
5979708	5989435	All that aside, I just think publishers in part, the people that were going to E3, are partially to blame for why E3 went in the crapper.
5989975	5995699	I mean, the year Paris Hilton showed up at E3, that was the year I was like, something ain't right.
5996979	5998940	I just can't believe the people who actually wanted to go see her.
5999780	6003321	So honestly, blame yourselves for ruining E3.
6003681	6014025	I think if they're going to bring E3 back on a big spectacle, which it seems like maybe EA is going to start bullying them to do it, have some freaking responsibility with what you decide to show at these shows.
6014205	6016585	I don't care if Paris Hilton has a cell phone game coming out.
6016865	6017966	Keep her the fuck out of my show.
6018386	6023968	I think that what they should do if they're going to have the celebrity events like that, they put them in the...
6025628	6029291	What was the other hall that the little games had to hang out in?
6029431	6029852	Kensha.
6029932	6030993	Yeah, they need to hang out there.
6031493	6037317	I don't have a problem with them bringing celebrities or even non-celebrities like Paris Hilton because you know what?
6037337	6040360	That's up to the game publishers how they want to promote their game and stuff.
6040400	6042121	And if they want to do that, fine.
6042161	6043322	You don't have to go see it.
6043442	6044643	It's whatever.
6045404	6045484	Um...
6046425	6055753	I do think, though, that they have to figure out what the hell they're trying to actually accomplish with E3 because the whole thing before was it's getting crazy because there's too many people here and we can't get business done.
6056433	6059656	Well, now that it's more intimate, are you getting business done?
6060136	6063999	Obviously, you're not satisfied the way it is, then what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
6064520	6069103	I think once they figure that out, you know, maybe, I don't know, let's not take such extremes.
6069544	6075408	Maybe we just keep it the way it used to be, but, I don't know, make it slightly more restrictive on who gets in.
6077529	6078310	I don't know.
6078570	6081733	What they need to do is just find a happy medium.
6084796	6085277	Alright.
6085777	6087339	Well, let's move on.
6093350	6100416	So, other EA-related news is that EA formed a partnership now with id Software.
6101036	6109862	And, of course, that also means that their brand new first-person shooter title, Rage, is going to be published by EA.
6110543	6111724	So, that's kind of neat.
6113565	6119509	Some other... I wonder if that also includes Doom 4, which...
6121703	6124084	I don't think they actually announced anything for that.
6126026	6126566	Interesting.
6129348	6135132	But yet another big developer to get under their EA belt.
6136693	6137713	Hopefully do something with it.
6138834	6142457	Slowly this big collective is being built even more and more.
6142577	6145118	You will be assimilated into the big EA.
6147179	6152420	One thing that's not getting assimilated to EA though, because this is a Konami thing, this is Gradius Rebirth.
6152761	6153821	This is kind of interesting.
6155201	6162903	It's almost as if Mega Man 9 was just the beginning, because now apparently there's this new Gradius game that's going to be coming out for the Wii on WiiWare.
6162943	6168144	I mean, no news yet if it's going to come out for Xbox and PlayStation Network as well, like Mega Man 9 is supposed to be.
6168624	6174627	But apparently, Gradius Rebirth is going to be coming out on the Japanese Wii systems around this summer, probably next month or so.
6175468	6176949	But it's apparently what this game is.
6177009	6182251	If it's a remake of Gradius 1 or if it's a new Gradius game, that quite is not known just yet.
6183132	6186194	The old school Gradius, though, is already available on the virtual console.
6186234	6190356	So I would think this is some type of new adventure maybe based on the old Gradius.
6190396	6194458	But, you know, this is kind of one of those series that people said they were kind of sad when it died.
6194498	6196819	Like there was the one, there was what, Gradius 5 on the PlayStation 2?
6196859	6197259	That was pretty cool.
6197280	6197940	And then it kind of disappeared.
6199561	6201163	Jamie, I know you're a big Gradius fan.
6201183	6202444	Is this something you're excited about?
6202844	6204005	Anything Gradius we get.
6205407	6207589	And it even has the Moai heads in it, which is pretty rad.
6207769	6209551	You can't have Gradius without Moai heads.
6209711	6210291	Absolutely.
6210371	6211392	So that's going to be pretty cool.
6212053	6216277	Coming out in Japan this summer, and I'm imagining America soon enough.
6218017	6227261	In other news, I guess sort of related to the Wii, this was actually supposed to go with my previous story about the status of E3.
6228202	6237266	But Miyamoto is quoted as saying that E3 is no longer where they're going to be showing off games for the core audience.
6237306	6239046	And we did mention this earlier in the show.
6239066	6240087	Yeah.
6241761	6258841	but he said that he's quoted as saying that for a very long time E3 was an event where I guess the developers catered specifically to the core gamer so they're actually using it as something to bounce off the mass public the casual gamer their new market that they're trying to get a hold of
6261142	6274647	But he said that E3 isn't the right place to point out their classics like Zelda or their major titles that have been their staple that their fans actually care about.
6277182	6278023	and I'll see you next time.
6306954	6309797	F you to the woman who nearly ran into my car on Friday.
6310478	6332957	I was coming out of the parking lot to turn right onto the road so that I could go back to work and this woman turns directly into my car trying to pull into the entrance side of this little, you know, entrance leading back onto the road and lo and behold the bitch was on her phone.
6334677	6339542	And Julie and I rolled down the windows and said, hang up your goddamn phone.
6340522	6341924	And she looked confused.
6342644	6348129	And I was like, bitch, if both of your hands had been on the wheel, you could have controlled the wheel enough to turn it in all the way.
6348470	6352233	It was very clear she was trying to turn the wheel with her hand and her elbow.
6353414	6357518	Like, bitch, your phone conversation is not worth, you know, risking my life over.
6357658	6358839	Hang up your goddamn phone.
6359720	6359980	The end.
6363546	6382618	Anyways, F you to stupid people at movie theaters who get there either at the time of the showing or five minutes prior to it and expect to find a good seat, especially when people have sat down and have maybe one seat next to them and they want you to move over.
6382938	6383378	You know what?
6383518	6392281	I didn't get to the movie 50 minutes early just to have some idiot come right on time and tell me the move because you don't want to sit up front.
6392321	6392801	Well, tough.
6393061	6393361	You know what?
6393381	6397322	If I got to the movie right as it's starting, then I expect to sit in the front and you should too.
6397722	6399223	So fuck you inconsiderate bitches.
6400823	6401844	And she was a fat cow too.
6401884	6403364	She was playing with her cell phone during the movie.
6405302	6406182	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6426887	6429509	I'm like, okay, so I get to decide if I have surgery or not.
6429569	6431291	That's kind of neat, I guess.
6431691	6434534	So I decide I'm going to go get a second opinion because I can't make decisions by myself.
6435575	6439758	But the other one is that I've decided I kind of have too many hobbies going on right now.
6440238	6443281	So I've made a difficult decision that I'm going to be cutting one of them out.
6443381	6444402	It's not this one, don't worry.
6444962	6449566	But it's always difficult because that kind of...
6450507	6451728	What's the best way to do it?
6451748	6452868	I gotta do what I gotta do So
6477907	6479368	It's not Warcraft either, sorry.
6479849	6481950	Oh, I was going to say... No, it's not Warcraft.
6482030	6482450	No, no, no.
6483031	6483932	Alright, it doesn't matter.
6484772	6486253	It's not the guessing game.
6487174	6488235	It's something.
6488655	6494940	It's something big that I'm going to hate to get away from, but I have to do it for me.
6495860	6496381	I'll tell you later.
6497421	6498002	Okay.
6498042	6498782	I couldn't read your lips.
6498923	6499183	Alright.
6500564	6502025	Alright, so that's it for the FUs of the Week.
6503086	6503186	Um...
6504204	6505386	Other people are quitting WoW.
6505486	6505786	I'm not.
6505866	6506647	I still love WoW.
6506668	6508931	WoW's great, but I don't play it every day anymore.
6510112	6510893	I play once in a while.
6512008	6518272	Apparently somebody out there was actually listening to me or at least thought the same thing when I saw the movie Wanted.
6519252	6522594	They are bringing a Wanted game out to the market.
6522694	6533140	Universal and Grin are working on a Wanted game and it will allow you to do all the fun stuff like curving bullets and going into assassin time as they call it.
6534781	6538003	Only sad thing though is it's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.
6538343	6540825	I was really hoping for a Wii Wanted game because...
6541405	6544486	I really think that'd be cool, especially with the new Motion Plus.
6544646	6551187	Now you could attach that to the bottom of your, you know, Nyko Perfect shot and curve the bullets that way, but whatever.
6552387	6553007	So it'll be cool, though.
6553227	6553908	Worth checking out.
6553988	6564150	Hopefully it'll be out around the time when the DVD comes out, which is holiday, maybe, but, you know, if we're just seeing it now and it hasn't been developed for a while, it could be crap.
6565390	6565810	Scares me.
6567352	6567912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6587265	6597591	In the game, apparently, there's going to be PvP achievements, PvE achievements, achievements for exploring the world, achievements for crafting, achievements for questing and developing a character.
6597651	6598832	I mean, all these different things.
6599112	6601654	But what I like is that some of the achievements are silly.
6601674	6604676	There's an achievement that you can unlock for giving 10 hugs.
6605496	6606417	to other players.
6606877	6610638	So if you're just a hug slut, you get an achievement for that, which is kind of funny, I think.
6611479	6617402	Apparently there are really, really, really difficult achievements as well called Feats of Strength.
6618082	6619142	So, interesting.
6619523	6626926	I'm assuming this is all going to be able to be tracked on Blizzard's website and the Armory and all that fun stuff too, but my question is what about all the stuff I've already done?
6627046	6631828	Is WoW going to be capable of knowing that I've done all this stuff on my current level 70?
6631969	6633029	Because that's going to
6633569	6640151	Well, that's how they're doing the PlayStation trophies is even if you've done this crap, it's not going to be able to know based on your save game.
6640171	6641452	You have to go back and actually do it again.
6641672	6642012	Right, right.
6642272	6647454	You know, other websites, I was going to say Newgrounds kind of does something similar with their Flash games.
6647534	6652595	Actually, all the Flash games have kind of trophies built into it and stuff.
6652675	6654696	So that's kind of neat that they do that too.
6654796	6657477	And, you know, I think while doing it, it's...
6658339	6658819	Thank you for watching!
6679358	6685386	Well, something else that's fairly cool, and this actually has to do with Silent Hill Homecoming.
6687249	6694359	They were actually showing that there will be our good buddy with the red pyramid hanging out
6694939	6700706	in part of Silent Hill Homecoming and that it's going to have a PC version.
6701687	6703249	So, that's pretty cool.
6705171	6707574	Just like, I guess, the ones before it except for the very first one.
6708315	6709937	But that's pretty cool information.
6710117	6711979	I mean, he would have to be...
6712580	6713020	PYRAMID HEAD
6734918	6736139	I was actually going to ask you about that.
6736260	6746450	Are you going to forgive it for maybe bending the lore in Silent Hill to give the fans service of having Red Pyramid, Pyramid Head, whatever in the game?
6746731	6749814	We did have some reoccurring critters.
6749954	6751376	Certain same types of things.
6751596	6752897	As long as he rapes things.
6769868	6785905	Pyramid Head, for those who don't know, he goes around having his way with the female creatures of the town of Silent Hill including the double-sided mannequins and the nurses and then he goes around stabbing random women who keep regenerating.
6786656	6788477	I need to watch the Silent Hill movie again.
6788577	6789398	God, it was great.
6789518	6790699	Come over to my house and watch it.
6790719	6792040	Seriously, I want to watch it on Blu-ray.
6792060	6792720	I bet it's pretty.
6792780	6793601	I need to get it.
6793801	6794642	You don't have it on Blu-ray?
6794982	6797824	No, I want it, and my husband's a butthole.
6797984	6798804	He has it on Blu-ray.
6799085	6800406	Can we watch it on Blu-ray once?
6800426	6801967	I mean, I love my husband very much.
6802087	6802827	He's not always a butthole.
6802867	6804508	We did it at your apartment, your old apartment.
6804889	6805929	I don't think we watched the whole thing.
6806190	6806450	Yeah.
6806850	6807610	We can bring it over.
6808731	6810633	But I've got, like, the Humongoy TV.
6810793	6812714	We need Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Night.
6813655	6813995	Okay.
6814015	6814095	Okay.
6815714	6816875	Maybe that should be a holiday.
6817515	6819876	An official holiday of Orange Sounds Radio.
6820076	6824338	I hear the creepy rabbits from number two, I think, are back.
6825139	6825739	That's cool.
6826399	6827620	We have to also have nurses.
6827740	6828641	We have to have nurses.
6828981	6830221	And I want the screaming things.
6831842	6835724	I would ask the chat room, what day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?
6835864	6836605	Not Halloween.
6836625	6837325	That's too obvious.
6837385	6837945	Some other day.
6838726	6840847	What day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?
6842287	6842728	So we'll see.
6842848	6843188	Tuesday.
6843208	6843789	September 12th.
6844670	6845070	Why is that?
6845550	6845891	I don't know.
6845911	6846772	The day after your birthday?
6847773	6847893	Yeah.
6848213	6848954	Well, you could do it.
6849154	6852358	How about the release date of Silent Hill Homecoming?
6852538	6853178	Oh, there you go.
6853239	6853939	Or the day before.
6854280	6855781	What was the day that Silent Hill 2 came out?
6855801	6856622	I don't know.
6856642	6857323	I'll have to look that up.
6857625	6859166	That should be Pyramid Head.
6859606	6862588	I will look that up and we will dub that Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
6862648	6864909	I will look that up right now while we get into another story.
6865070	6865310	Okay.
6865650	6866590	Awesome.
6866610	6887003	Well, this is kind of weird and it may not actually be a confirmation at all, but apparently there are some people that performed some sort of social engineering prank that had 2K Games support believing that there is a hacked version of Grand Theft Auto 4's PC version, at least a demo of it, on a pirate site.
6887697	6893207	and apparently there was some back and forth going on with the tech support.
6894144	6900929	The PC version of Grand Theft Auto 4 has not even been announced for release and is still in development.
6900969	6906232	So it's not about to be released on a website.
6907033	6911035	Well, people are reading into that thinking, well, it's still in development.
6911075	6913117	Well, that kind of confirms that it's actually coming out.
6913677	6919361	But the whole thing is, does really their tech support know anything about games in development?
6920502	6920822	I don't know.
6921289	6921609	Maybe.
6921990	6925833	I mean, I would think it'd be kind of dumb if they didn't put out a PC version.
6926793	6931938	And I know the last few PlayStation 2 games have been on, you know, PC.
6932618	6934279	So, why not?
6935220	6935941	So maybe it's coming.
6936181	6937062	Just might take some time.
6938047	6940449	Alright, and I'm sure that makes a lot of people very happy.
6940649	6942811	Especially because PC means easily hackable.
6943251	6943952	Exactly.
6944052	6945653	It means mod crazy.
6945813	6946374	Mod crazy.
6946634	6947134	Alright, here we go.
6947194	6948055	Here's the answer to the question.
6948075	6948675	We did the research.
6949276	6951478	Silent Hill 2 was released in North America.
6951538	6953339	Believe it or not, North America got it first.
6953399	6954440	Japan got it three days later.
6955241	6956341	September 24th, 2001.
6956562	6959424	Too bad it's not the 23rd.
6959624	6960405	You know, it's funny.
6960645	6966830	September 24th, I think, is very close, if not the exact release date of Homecoming.
6967975	6968755	Interesting.
6969396	6969996	Well, there you have it.
6970036	6970856	So I guess that's it.
6970916	6973897	So do we officially... No, September 24th is a Wednesday this year.
6973977	6975578	So it might be like September 23rd.
6975978	6977878	Or that might be the day you actually can get it in a store.
6977898	6982380	If it's the 23rd, then we have the number of consequence.
6982420	6983340	24th can be a release date.
6983400	6984921	Games mostly come out on Wednesdays.
6985701	6987041	It's like a street date.
6987081	6988922	I mean, they have the ship date, but you know.
6989262	6989642	Whatever.
6989722	6991383	I think we... But we have the official word.
6991443	6994364	September 24th is Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
6995208	6995588	Official.
6995749	6996009	Done.
6996610	6997130	Done deal.
6997170	6997611	Sign.
6997891	6998451	Get the wax.
6999332	7000914	Let's get the seal, the OLR seal.
7001214	7003857	That's in our new universe of Orange Loungia.
7004277	7004578	All right.
7007180	7010043	I like that, Orange Loungia.
7010083	7012726	How should people celebrate Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day?
7013947	7017291	You can't tell them to rape things because, unfortunately, rape is not funny.
7018930	7026897	You can just have them put on a big cardboard pyramid on their head and walk around with like, since you know it's really hard to find a great knife like that, walk around with a plastic knife.
7027057	7030160	Walk around the neighborhood and threaten the cats in your neighborhood.
7030220	7031001	Hold a plastic knife.
7031041	7031941	You have to have a plastic knife.
7032922	7033663	And take pictures.
7034063	7035484	Bake pyramid head cakes.
7035685	7036805	Yes, bake pyramid head cakes.
7036825	7037146	That's it.
7037286	7039328	Pyramid head cupcakes and pass them out to the neighbors.
7039408	7040328	And they have to be red velvet.
7042472	7045753	All right, so we want pictures of you celebrating Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
7045853	7049435	And the best cupcake wins.
7050636	7051056	Something.
7051456	7053477	Wins eaten by the hosts.
7054197	7054937	You know what would be awesome?
7055037	7055217	What?
7055338	7056138	If we had a lot of money.
7056818	7057658	I mean, a lot, a lot of money.
7057939	7058099	What?
7058559	7062661	You get Charm City Cakes to build you a sculpture of Pyramid Head as a cake.
7063741	7064021	Great.
7064221	7065382	I have a friend that makes wedding cakes.
7066561	7067402	That wouldn't be too bad.
7067782	7071365	Shaoran in chat says, can I wear my pyramid-shaped tinfoil hat instead?
7071405	7072026	You certainly can.
7072386	7073187	But we want pictures.
7074108	7074708	I like that.
7074728	7076770	Pyramid-shaped cupcakes.
7076950	7077590	You could do that.
7077650	7079852	I mean, just kind of take a cupcake and kind of either...
7081308	7082089	You can make your own molds.
7082449	7083770	But no, seriously, contest.
7084191	7087133	Dun-da-dun.
7087513	7089895	And the rules are whatever we decide they are at the time.
7090776	7097142	One of them is a costume contest for your best, not necessarily cosplay, but just your best celebration of Pyramid Head.
7098123	7100825	And the second one is how pretty your cupcakes are.
7100845	7105669	I don't know if Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day is that PC.
7105849	7106110	I mean...
7106750	7107690	Who cares?
7107991	7110492	Maybe rape victims might be offended by that.
7110552	7112072	Yeah, I know.
7112292	7113193	We might be offending some people.
7113213	7114153	Okay, it's just Red Pyramid Day.
7114654	7117095	Or Pyramid Head Appreciation Day would be fine.
7117135	7117655	Red Pyramid Day.
7118315	7119716	Rape of people is not funny.
7119796	7121937	Rape of monsters is funny.
7122857	7124158	Because monsters are bad.
7124998	7126499	And when bad people... What?
7126599	7128019	I'm just not going to keep going down this line.
7128039	7128900	Let go of the shovel.
7128920	7129920	Yeah, I'm digging myself a hole.
7129980	7131321	How about... What?
7132521	7133082	Pyramid Head Day.
7133402	7133742	What?
7134696	7137860	I still like Pyramid Head of Rape Appreciation Day, but only when it rapes monsters.
7137880	7139341	How about the rape appreciation event?
7140843	7141403	You know what they should do?
7141423	7142344	We should have a rape carnival.
7142745	7143566	Wouldn't that be cool?
7143706	7148851	Is the mold your own custom, like... Or I can see the hate mail coming from a mile away.
7148871	7150693	We should mold our, like, custom, like...
7155280	7161403	We need your ideas of how to turn this into a politically correct event.
7161704	7162744	There's no way, Rob.
7163945	7165406	Shaoran says, I'm offended.
7165446	7166966	Some of my best friends are monsters.
7167006	7167907	You asshole.
7171249	7175191	And no, Joshi16, there will not be a rape-a-thon this part of the day.
7175211	7177272	This is horrible.
7177292	7179493	No, it's going to be Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
7179894	7180134	Alright.
7181488	7182108	We'll figure something out.
7182169	7183289	Okay.
7183729	7188192	Anyhow, in a completely different topic, I'm sure there'll be a lot of appreciation for this as well.
7188632	7193856	It has been announced that BioWare and LucasArts, they are building the MMO for Knights of the Old Republic.
7193896	7199359	Now, this is different from the existing Star Wars MMO, but there is that new Knights of the Old Republic MMO that's going to be going on.
7200119	7209265	It's pretty cool, and you can see this whole thing that's posted, I guess it's on Portfolio.com, and it has been confirmed this is Knights of the Round...
7209725	7211506	I'm sorry, Knights of the Round Republic.
7211686	7212586	That would be awesome.
7212626	7214287	Knights of the Round, the old Capcom game.
7214627	7217108	Knights of the Old Republic is online.
7217188	7218768	It's Knights of the Old Old Republic.
7220149	7220529	Shut up.
7220969	7224830	I cannot think of Kotor without thinking of my friend who tested it and what they called it in office.
7224870	7225631	Who was that?
7225811	7226351	Skrotor.
7228552	7228812	Nice.
7229352	7229792	Very nice.
7230532	7231533	So, there you have it.
7231553	7233433	That game will be coming probably in a couple years.
7233453	7237054	It's probably still a little ways out, but I'm sure there's lots of people that are waiting to ditch WoW for that.
7237074	7238215	It'll be good times.
7238837	7246599	Alright, anyhow, we're going to get into another segment here on Orange Launch Radio that's good times because it's the chance for us to hear from the listeners.
7246659	7247779	It's the Mailbag segment.
7248099	7253260	Every week we invite your emails at Mailbag, OrangeLaunchRadio.com and let's read some of those emails right now.
7260002	7260922	Uh, emails.
7261022	7261602	We have some.
7261622	7261922	The end.
7262250	7263191	Wait, can I jump in here?
7263211	7265072	Because there's a great idea from Ossifer in chat.
7265913	7267294	Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
7267634	7272518	The day that people across the world wear pyramid hats and rip skin off their fried chicken.
7273459	7276521	It says ripping skin off chicks.
7277342	7278182	Yeah, but it's chicken.
7280224	7281485	So that way it's politically correct.
7283026	7285788	I think Ossifer set a good starting point.
7286168	7287850	I think there's a good idea in there somewhere.
7288330	7289131	Anyway, sorry, mail.
7292183	7293263	From Rob with two B's.
7294343	7298304	A deer, two guys, a girl, and an olive garden, home of the never-ending salad and breadsticks.
7298905	7301745	Is it me or is the news from E3 much more boring this year?
7302386	7309488	One of the things that was a new Wiimote Shun add-on that more accurately judges the controller's aspect.
7309928	7313289	Isn't this a more or less throw-out to your old plastic thingies?
7314269	7319951	It won't fit onto the zapper so maybe you won't need it for older games but there will have to be a new zapper.
7320131	7321972	Are two zappers truly better than one?
7324273	7324393	No.
7325673	7329814	Or you can buy the Nyko Perfect Shot and then slap it into the pass-through in the bottom.
7330775	7333516	Not that both games will probably be using the thing at the same time.
7334416	7337237	Or you could just save yourself the money and not buy a zapper because they're shit.
7338999	7341680	I actually don't agree that E3 was necessarily disappointing.
7341760	7347082	I think especially at Microsoft's camp, I think they did just fine.
7347202	7356785	I mean, you knew that nobody was going to be announcing a new system this year, and I think the only thing that made Microsoft's press conference a little bit, we knew that was coming, was because of the leak that had already happened.
7356845	7362686	I think if you hadn't known about the avatars in advance, I think it would have been a pretty big deal to see that new dashboard for the first time.
7363287	7367528	And even still, we didn't know that the new dashboard was coming, we just knew that avatars were coming.
7367588	7367808	True, true.
7368288	7397257	and the other thing too is I like the format of the new E3 with all the press conferences because it's very much like gamers days and I think it's a lot easier to digest the information unless of course you're doing Capcom's press conference where all they do is talk about the fucking Lost Planet movie but no information out of that but I like the old show floor of the original E3 so if we can kind of do both that'd be awesome
7398789	7411269	Well, you notice that when we went to press events our last year of going, they were sort of off in those little rooms where they had the little trailer area set up inside the show floor.
7412017	7412417	I loved it.
7412658	7414519	When we got to go to Bethesda's thing, that was great.
7414539	7415800	I loved Bethesda's area.
7415820	7416421	They were so nice.
7416501	7418323	It was just because it was chill.
7418363	7420404	And I really actually liked PlayNC.
7421525	7428532	Everybody that let us in, I just distinctly remember Bethesda because they had a lot of stuff I was kind of interested in at the time.
7428692	7429512	Call of Cthulhu.
7429953	7430493	Where's that?
7431594	7437940	I think any company, even at the old E3, kind of getting off the main floor into those little back rooms and stuff was kind of neat.
7438280	7441683	Call of Cthulhu came out in 2005 on the Xbox.
7441723	7442704	I completely missed it.
7443124	7445666	Well, I don't think anyone missed it.
7446127	7448689	I remember being so excited and then I never heard anything about it.
7450310	7457676	Well, to make it up, there is a new Cthulhu movie coming out that stars Tori Spelling.
7457876	7459978	Unfortunately, not as Cthulhu, but you know.
7463501	7464402	And she has a small part.
7465291	7466692	Oh, okay, so she's just a cameo.
7466953	7467833	Maybe she dies really well.
7468634	7468934	Anyway.
7469175	7470436	Maybe she's Cthulhu, I don't know.
7470836	7471577	Cthulhu.
7473038	7484047	Anyway, Uber email, really long, and this comes from GS191, and it's really long.
7484067	7486810	I read the first two paragraphs or something.
7487669	7488950	Well, it's really long.
7489511	7489991	Hello there.
7490331	7493053	It's been a while since I've written anything to you all.
7493514	7498097	Nevertheless, I'm still an avid listener of the show, even though I haven't been able to be in the chat room in quite a while.
7498538	7504442	You can blame my World of Warcraft guild and them pushing me to level my Gnome Mage to 70 so they can get another crowd controller in the group.
7504702	7505143	Go figure.
7505863	7513892	Anyway, after sitting through all the big three E3 press conferences, I do have some choice words about all of them.
7514312	7520579	By the way, I have to give many grats to G4 for showing all of the E3 press conferences for the big three with no commercials.
7521180	7527707	I must say, it was quite nice to see them on a 50-inch plasma TV, but standard definition for the loose.
7528424	7530425	To be honest, it would be better just to stream them.
7530485	7534948	I heard that they cut away for the Final Fantasy XIII announcement to show the audience.
7535389	7539712	Instead of, you know, viewing the wonderful trailer for Final Fantasy XIII.
7539732	7542574	They actually had to, because there was a little thing that came up on the screen.
7542614	7543374	I don't know if you saw it.
7543954	7544795	It got leaked out somewhere.
7544815	7547937	There was a little thing on the screen that said, please do not videotape the following trailer.
7548297	7549178	So I think they had to.
7549298	7552140	Yet there is video footage of it.
7552160	7554702	Well, that was Square's thing, not G4's probably.
7554722	7554922	Yeah.
7556485	7575690	Well, just in general, from what I'm seeing about the Microsoft one, is that I guess he seems pretty happy about Fallout 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, saying that they did a good job showing it and being excited about Final Fantasy XIII.
7576270	7581532	I'm actually going to post this email also in our forum.
7582652	7584753	So I'll put a link to it in the chat room later on.
7584853	7588033	But it's a fairly lengthy email, but I think it makes some very, very good points.
7589094	7596715	And, of course, Sony is having their demo of Resistance 2 and LittleBigPlanet demo and that type of stuff.
7597136	7601737	So I'm going to be actually posting this in its entirety on the forum.
7601997	7603577	So, in a minute.
7604297	7604697	Awesome.
7605297	7605838	It is really long.
7607685	7609446	Hey, Ossifer's building on the idea.
7609686	7612388	Now, this could be for the Pyramid Head Carnival, okay?
7612888	7614809	Gaming events for the Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
7615129	7620812	Spin the Pyramid, Silent Hillopoly, Sorry, You Got Raped, and Twisted Pyramid.
7621373	7623074	Twister, but in more compromised positions.
7623674	7625795	I do, though, have to read the closure to his letter.
7626716	7626976	What's that?
7626996	7628817	It's from MichaelGS191.
7629717	7632859	This email is brought to you by the never-ending disappointment that is Nintendo.
7632879	7634680	Where's my fucking Star Fox remake for the Wii?
7635400	7636101	Or F-Zero.
7636141	7636621	Get in line.
7638908	7641289	Well, continuing on, shall I?
7641750	7642130	You shall.
7642410	7643931	Into other email adventures.
7645092	7646232	This is actually from Sauce.
7647973	7649154	Hey guys, gals, and ferrets.
7650155	7651135	Wait, wait, wait, where's the ferret?
7652096	7652856	The question, where's the ferret?
7652876	7653737	You had the ferret earlier.
7653777	7655318	The ferret was snuggling in my boobs.
7655538	7655778	I see.
7655798	7655838	Ah!
7657546	7658808	Is that how you lost it?
7659148	7660190	No, I was actually sitting on it.
7661852	7667960	I come bearing another video game review to add to the OLR collection, this time the game of choice is God of War, Chains of Olympus.
7668782	7673608	I'm including a link to the review for the chatroom's reading pleasure, which I will link in the chatroom momentarily.
7674289	7682656	The short version of the review is that Chains of Olympus is a fun, non-stop, action-packed game worth playing for any God of War fan or any fan of hack-and-slash violence.
7683236	7685758	It has excellent graphics and sound and is definitely worth the play.
7686559	7699850	Anyone interested in keeping up with my video game reviews or articles about comics and movies, as are the three industries are very much tied into one another, can follow me on Twitter under MarrenMarvel for updates.
7700450	7701751	Keep up the good job, OLR.
7701771	7705772	Maybe someday Skye and I will rock the boat and you'll see the reviews on the OLR website.
7705812	7706352	Winky face.
7706432	7707032	Someday.
7707933	7708993	Sincerely, Lauren.
7709573	7710954	I'm going to link it in the chat room in just a sec.
7711314	7712314	Yes, I need to read it still.
7713555	7714375	I'm kind of curious.
7714535	7720597	I'm curious to hear what she thinks of it because I don't know if she's a huge God of War fan, so I'm kind of curious what she thinks of the PSP one.
7721058	7722178	So, we'll see.
7722848	7725469	The chat room has now been officially linked.
7727510	7730392	So, last email, which came very last minute.
7730472	7736294	Also, Rob with 2B sent me other emails, but I'm going to save those for being related to last minute story stuff.
7736815	7737515	They're pretty cool things.
7738154	7738855	Hey, OLR!
7739675	7741917	I got the Orange Box for PS3 a couple of days ago.
7742037	7744059	I can't believe I waited so long for such a great game.
7744499	7748162	Even though I haven't played the original Half-Life, the story is still pretty easy to follow.
7749863	7752966	And it's kind of fun to guess what happened before, plus it looks amazing.
7753526	7761032	Portal also made me smile at the sly remarks, but I have to say, playing the Flash game first makes the first bunch of levels much easier.
7761653	7763835	If anyone hasn't picked it up yet, do so immediately.
7763895	7765156	Preferably not now, but maybe...
7767017	7769439	Tomorrow during AGI since you won't miss the whole show.
7770119	7772501	Miss a whole lot in the 20 minutes it takes to get it.
7774502	7778425	I'm listening to the show right now and I hope that... Let me start over.
7778725	7780806	I hope I can get Skype to work this time.
7781206	7782547	Anyway, I look forward to the show.
7782627	7783768	Thanks for reading this email.
7783868	7787631	If you don't read this email, then I guess there's no point in me thanking you.
7787691	7788951	So if you don't, no thanks.
7789972	7791334	and SincerelyPKJr92.
7791634	7798662	This email is sponsored by everything and everyone else not yet mentioned, so now if you sign your emails, you'll be pirating my right to beat that.
7800283	7800844	Alrighty then.
7802668	7803649	It's dot com.
7804890	7805270	Is that it?
7805931	7806171	Yes.
7806271	7808293	Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
7808393	7809474	Email us some stuff.
7810255	7815179	Try to not make it so epic though because then we don't have time to read it on air so we have to post it in the forums.
7815239	7818442	Not that that's a bad thing but you know keep it concise.
7818883	7819884	We like concise emails.
7822870	7824912	Moving on with some gaming news, right, Loki?
7825512	7825733	Yes.
7826353	7828075	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
7828095	7836622	There's been some more details unveiled about the game, including that it will have 20-plus characters and download content as well.
7837583	7846711	Of course, they didn't really say too much else other than they were going to be splitting up the roster with DC and Mortal Kombat characters.
7846771	7847412	There's also...
7848753	7877687	Fatalities or Brutalities I guess for the Villains that are going to be in it So if you're playing as DC villains You can kill people but The DC heroes will not be able to kill people They'll just only maim I think No It depends which Batman we're getting Adam West's Batman never really killed anyone Wonder Woman killed someone With her bare hands Actually I do believe that Adam West should be in this game That would Sell it for me but
7879231	7881272	Adam West, Batman should totally be in this game.
7881292	7883453	Either way, you can expect this game in November.
7884913	7885293	Cool.
7886094	7893197	Well, Harmonix has given us a few details this E3 about the Rock Band 1 compatibility in Rock Band 2.
7893457	7899499	Of course, Rock Band 2 was a game that caught a lot of people's attention at E3 this year, and it's already kind of sneaking out there.
7900960	7903701	They showed the game at some side parties that were held and things.
7903761	7904521	It sounds kind of cool.
7904961	7911549	and one of the rumors out there was that you were going to be able to have all your Rock Band 1 tracks in Rock Band 2 and it turns out, true statement.
7912450	7919438	Apparently, what happens is that you're not going to be able to transfer all the songs because apparently...
7919758	7920699	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7940680	7963864	apparently though you are going to have to pay a small fee like maybe like a $5 fee to transfer the songs over but I still think it's kind of neat because man if you add like you know 60 songs from Rock Band 1 or however many you know they end up having and then your download tracks and the Rock Band 2 that's a lot of freaking songs seriously a lot of freaking songs so there you have it
7965009	7969941	Rock Band 2 songs and Rock Band 1 songs together in one roof.
7970102	7970583	Amazing.
7970763	7972187	That's how they should be doing it.
7972849	7972989	Yeah.
7973513	7981536	Well, in other news, there is a date out for Play TV, something that's going to record your TV shows while you're gaming.
7982196	7990159	It's coming out in Europe from September to December, the first release date being the 10th of September for the UK.
7990999	8001143	It's a DVR that adds on to the PlayStation 3, so you can use it while you're playing something that you just happen to really be into to record whatever...
8001983	8007427	You know, a show that happens to be coming on while you're busy, you know, killing people in your game.
8007688	8014913	You know, kudos for them for making an add-on for the PS3, but isn't that just a VCR?
8015914	8016795	It's TiVo!
8017415	8024200	But you can still record, I mean, like, if you're playing a video game, you can still record stuff on your TV, you just have it record off of a different channel.
8025081	8029564	It's just like, remember how with the old VCRs you could watch one show while recording another?
8030472	8031373	I don't know.
8032413	8033074	It's TiVo.
8033294	8034435	If it fills your need, I guess.
8036216	8042320	They've also got release dates for Australia and New Zealand around January.
8046662	8049204	We're having fun network issues in-house again.
8050025	8054908	Live listeners are noticing that Justin.TV went down again and I think we're just going to pull the plug on that for the night.
8055208	8056069	Bye-bye.
8056129	8056449	Sorry.
8057554	8062256	But we don't know how else to fix our network issues and usually JTV is the first thing that has to go.
8062397	8062937	Sorry.
8062977	8065038	Do you really want to watch people just talking?
8065438	8076004	I guess people like Justin TV because there's not as much lag and that they can hear the things that go on during the break time and that I guess the sound's better but I don't believe that.
8076504	8078745	The sound's crystal clear on all games so I don't get that.
8078845	8080266	Well my network just came back up so...
8080990	8083053	Yeah, so just kill Justin TV for the night.
8083073	8083514	Sorry, guys.
8083654	8084155	Alrighty.
8085396	8089603	Now it's fun naked time, so ha-ha, you miss out, Justin TV.
8091345	8091605	Anyways.
8091906	8093368	I'm taking my pants off right now.
8093528	8095211	We're going wild.
8097672	8124854	Guitar Hero On Tour Surprise is getting a sequel called On Tour Decades and I guess the first game sold just over a third of a million with 350,000 units sold in three weeks and the sequel no word on exactly when it's coming out there is rumors though that there might be some form of microphone functionality maybe karaoke um
8126092	8126433	I don't know.
8127133	8128976	No word though when it's coming out.
8130358	8131159	Big surprise!
8132601	8134303	A sequel for Guitar Hero game.
8134824	8139650	I mean, hey, they wouldn't want to leave the DS out with 50 billion releases each year.
8140031	8141032	Oh no, never.
8141052	8141152	Never.
8142895	8143195	Baby's Party
8171917	8174679	It's basically Imagine Babies, the party game.
8177181	8182324	It's coming out this autumn, and apparently you actually use the balance board in the game.
8183045	8187328	You actually play this at a babysitting academy, and there's 30 mini-games in the game.
8187848	8189409	It's head-to-head, co-op mode.
8189769	8195313	Both methods are available, and it's based on the typical day of a baby.
8197294	8198815	What, eat, sleep, poop, cry?
8198835	8199456	What?
8200566	8200826	Baby fart?
8200867	8201047	Grow up?
8201067	8202028	They can burp, they just need help
8215209	8220771	Um, what was the game they used to have at Milpitas Golf Land with the big buttons that was like the babies racing?
8221211	8225652	Oh, they had that at, um, at the game, at the game, the convention too.
8226592	8227733	It was... The hell was that?
8227753	8228653	Bye Bye Baby, no.
8228873	8230473	Bye Baby something?
8231474	8233054	Yeah, it was some like baby racing game.
8233094	8234394	Come on Baby, says AJ Mix.
8234414	8235075	Come on Baby, yeah.
8235915	8236455	There you go.
8237981	8239761	I can't wait for the breastfeeding minigame.
8266400	8266920	Me neither.
8267781	8269382	Anyhow, we've got a caller on Skype.
8269422	8270542	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8270583	8271043	Who's this?
8271923	8273884	Hi, this is GS68.
8274125	8275265	Hi, GS68.
8275285	8275746	How are you?
8276646	8276966	All right.
8277727	8281449	Hey, you got to go to California Extreme and you met Jamie live and in person, right?
8282289	8282490	Yep.
8283010	8285872	Now, I've asked you this because I've always wondered this myself.
8286192	8288453	What's Jamie like in real life off the air?
8290774	8291215	Last time I...
8292199	8299161	I kind of didn't recognize her at first, because last time I saw her was at Final Mate, and she had, I think, magenta-ish hair.
8299402	8300422	I don't remember.
8300542	8304903	Yeah, my hair was black in front and red in back.
8307644	8308905	But this time my hair was all black.
8309985	8319469	Also, Jamie, when you're speaking in person, you sound a little younger than you do right now on the air.
8320289	8320529	Okay.
8321112	8324474	I think the radio makes our voices bassier.
8324514	8327856	Well, didn't Travis say I used to sound like a hyperactive 13-year-old?
8328957	8330038	Yes, but then you went through puberty.
8330238	8331099	That was many years ago.
8335241	8335762	Alright, look.
8335822	8338103	In all seriousness, how was California Stream?
8339684	8340425	It was pretty cool.
8342026	8343267	Alright, then.
8343287	8344708	What games did you enjoy playing?
8345348	8349791	Were there some classic games you'd not really paid respect to before that caught your eyes?
8354666	8366014	Most of the games I played were games that I already played and I was familiar with or I hadn't played in a while like the old Star Wars arcade game or Tron.
8366034	8372379	I've played some games that I hadn't really played before like Tailgater and Looping.
8373356	8373856	Rob, build a meme.
8373876	8373936	Ugh.
8401158	8403079	But I want a real one.
8403099	8404380	It's real.
8404680	8405421	You can touch it.
8405781	8406301	Alright, alright.
8406321	8406902	We'll see, we'll see.
8406962	8408482	If you set it on fire, it'll burn.
8409423	8409783	We'll see.
8410063	8411845	I don't think my roommate would like that idea very much.
8412965	8413926	I know my wife didn't.
8413946	8417088	Yeah, except I'm not married to the roommate.
8417128	8418549	It's more of a business arrangement.
8418589	8419289	It's a little different.
8419969	8420790	Anyhow, I'm sorry.
8420810	8422131	I like to think of my marriage that way, too.
8423692	8425993	Originally, that's all marriage was, was a business agreement.
8426033	8428455	Look, GS68, is there anything we're getting on tangent?
8428475	8430716	Is there anything else you want to add about your wonderful weekend?
8431907	8437910	Yeah, but mostly I was playing The Grid, which is like this third-person shooter.
8439110	8439931	I know The Grid.
8439971	8441051	The Grid is awesome.
8441912	8446894	Yeah, and Rush 2049, which was the racing game of Horde before one-gun Maxi.
8447554	8449615	Did they ever bring The Grid out on home consoles?
8450415	8452036	I think it's on regular PlayStation, isn't it?
8452436	8453216	No, I don't think it is.
8453477	8454257	Wow, that's kind of weird.
8456127	8456487	Interesting.
8457268	8460171	Alright, well, GS68, any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we take another call?
8460451	8463434	Nintendo did not address restore space at E3.
8464054	8465676	Epic fucking fail.
8465936	8466216	Agreed.
8467253	8468954	I'm very disappointed they didn't address it.
8469234	8485205	I hold out hope that maybe since folks at Nintendo feel that this is not where they're going to be addressing the hardcore gamers anymore, my hopes are at PAX our questions will be answered because I can't think of what other show is for the hardcore gamers except maybe Tokyo Game Show.
8485265	8486626	Thank you for stealing my words.
8486686	8488407	Tokyo Game Show would be the other one.
8488507	8490869	They don't display at Tokyo Game Show though.
8490929	8492050	Normally Nintendo's not there.
8492290	8494053	Yeah, but they do something concurrent.
8494133	8496016	Yeah, they do that thing concurrently.
8496597	8497799	It's pretty much the same thing.
8500115	8507897	On all our end game facts, I have a statement that says I'm not removing it until Nintendo addresses Wii Store space.
8508997	8510518	I think it's very unfortunate they didn't.
8510718	8513959	I mean, that little speaker system is kind of whatever.
8514379	8518560	Just roll out a freaking patch that supports the SD cards.
8518940	8521180	Do it overnight while we're sleeping, you know?
8521240	8521981	Just do it.
8522501	8523661	Yeah, whatever happens.
8523701	8524181	PS2 did it.
8524321	8525762	The original Xbox did it.
8526282	8526842	Why can't...
8527777	8530018	A console that's one generation ahead.
8531419	8533460	Oh, but it's the new generation, not the next generation.
8533480	8540564	But you have to understand, they announced stuff that's been out on other systems forever and act like it's the newest thing ever.
8540624	8544206	Like, oh my god, it's voice chat over the internet.
8544326	8547188	This has never been done a billion times before.
8547708	8548749	Oh, but wait, it's different.
8548809	8554012	It's a community voice chat because it's a giant microphone thing instead of headsets.
8555014	8555414	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
8581149	8581389	Gold Banjo
8599023	8601065	I never got around to that.
8616219	8617600	That, well, you didn't miss much.
8617880	8620201	It'll come out until really late in the GameCube cycle.
8620261	8623002	Star Fox will be the thing that we get a couple years down the road.
8623323	8624503	But F-Zero, man.
8624963	8630586	Maybe it's just because Mario Kart is still out there, so they want Mario Kart to be the racing thing for a little while.
8630906	8633948	But I really hope that next year's E3 we get something about F-Zero.
8635097	8635858	Yeah, me too.
8636498	8636878	We'll see.
8637159	8639000	But I'm just a big F-Zero fan.
8639420	8639921	What can I say?
8640962	8643223	I wouldn't mind watching somebody else kind of pick that up.
8643464	8644765	You know, Wipeout's kind of cool.
8644785	8649168	I guess Wipeout's the closest thing I can think of on another system that's kind of like F-Zero, but it's not the same.
8649588	8651650	But I love that futuristic fast racing.
8651690	8653552	That's my favorite, is the future fast.
8653972	8654572	Speed Racer.
8655553	8655833	Really?
8655914	8656874	I'm going to have to check that out.
8656914	8657755	You should check it out.
8657855	8659056	It's actually pretty cool.
8659076	8659456	Do you own it?
8659937	8660257	Yes.
8660297	8661518	I'm going to borrow it.
8662594	8663435	You can't borrow it.
8686960	8687440	Thanks for watching!
8711417	8723600	I got my... But with the first online journey onto the online thing, there's always going to be that... The little kid that likes to swear and be rude.
8724120	8725341	Yeah, it happens.
8725681	8735003	The kid's like speaking some other language and stuff, and then once we start to try and vote ban him, then he apologizes and speaks English.
8735223	8738624	So I'm like, you know, now you can speak English.
8739244	8743947	and it just got me so mad and stuff and then he's like swearing not to ban him.
8744067	8744908	We just banned him.
8745068	8746149	No questions asked.
8746169	8748550	Good for you.
8748630	8753794	I have a zero tolerance policy for idiots on those things and on Xbox Live I warn them every time.
8754174	8755995	I do the little feedback thing every time.
8757036	8758617	I'm a little jerk on Xbox Live.
8758657	8759437	I'm a tattletale.
8759797	8760418	But you know what?
8761098	8761919	Somebody's got to do it.
8763513	8764073	Exactly.
8765054	8765914	It's just annoying.
8766454	8767735	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8767755	8769516	Go Banjo.
8770436	8771017	Let me think.
8772117	8774318	I don't know.
8775179	8778400	E3 could have been better, but I am excited for Banjo-Kazooie 3.
8778460	8779921	I don't care what anybody else says.
8780141	8783042	I'm a hardcore Banjo-Kazooie fan.
8783703	8786444	We haven't had a lot of Banjo-Kazooie love on the show tonight, so there you have it.
8786844	8814561	Gold Banjo adding a little bit of Banjo Kazooie love so it's not just a clever name Banjo Kazooie alright have a good night my friend take care I was going to say too real quick if you are interested in a game that's sort of like you know F-Zero try the Speed Racer Wii game it just dropped in price it's only $29.99 now and you probably can get it used for even cheaper I still need to play the pinball game I got on Wii I've played a little bit of it and it's fun I need to play more of it because pinball is awesome right Jamie?
8816109	8816829	Yes, it is.
8817130	8821232	Or if you don't own a Wii, you can get it on the PS2 coming in September.
8821592	8823773	Aw, Shaoran in chat called me a fucking narc.
8824694	8826595	But narc was an awesome game, so shut up.
8827055	8827856	Hi, you're on Orange Launch.
8828276	8829337	Winners don't use drugs, Rob.
8829697	8830677	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8830697	8831058	Who's this?
8832138	8833359	Bow down to Pyramid Head.
8833599	8834299	No, this is Osfer.
8834880	8835780	Hey, what's up, Osfer?
8837421	8838582	That would be cool if Pyramid Head did call us.
8838602	8845546	I feel like I'm the only one that was kind of excited for a new Zelda game to be announced, and it was never announced, so I'm sad.
8846991	8847692	It was Phantom Hourglass.
8847752	8847952	It was
8866482	8866882	I don't know.
8866962	8867623	It was okay.
8867783	8871106	You have to remember, Nintendo's developing for two major platforms now.
8871146	8873628	It's not just about the Wii, it's about the DS as well.
8874028	8876290	So, you know, they're a little split there.
8876370	8882475	But I think you'll see a new Zelda, you know, Uber-type looking game next year, probably.
8883455	8890141	I was more surprised that Kid Icarus thing, with all the evidence that supported its existence, I'm very surprised that didn't show up.
8890581	8891282	Very surprised.
8893143	8894084	Well, you know that there's just
8894656	8895797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8919721	8920421	Donkey Kong Barrel Blast
8950061	8953643	Of course, the Wii Zapper and Super Mario Galaxy.
8953883	8958686	I don't think there was anything for December, January or something.
8959066	8961568	But they have room to announce some more games in there.
8961588	8964409	And I don't think they're going to have one game for the holiday.
8964990	8967751	Unless they manage to get the Wii Sports Resort thing out.
8967871	8970253	So I expect some more announcements.
8972294	8975136	So some hopefulness from Loki that makes sense.
8975296	8975976	Makes sense to me.
8976036	8976476	He's right.
8976657	8978898	There's got to be more than one game coming out this Christmas.
8981438	8982399	Any other thoughts, Ossifer?
8985520	8991782	I'm kind of concerned about the future for DDR, seeing as that they want to add mines or shock arrows, as they call it, into it.
8993663	9003707	Eh, at least they're trying something new for them, but you're right, I don't think it's going to give the game the swift kick in the pants it needs, but it's something, I guess, to hold people over.
9005127	9009769	Well, I don't want DDR to turn into ITG, because that's one of the main reasons I hate in the group,
9010370	9015515	Yeah, and also, even if you can turn it off, like in the group, it kicks you from being able to rank in any of the songs, so, I don't know.
9035622	9036022	Interesting.
9037063	9037763	Well, we'll see.
9038383	9041564	I am curious about that new machine, though, when everyone comes to our neighborhood.
9041604	9043545	Hopefully it doesn't get broken by little kids first.
9043585	9043905	We'll see.
9044485	9048767	I forgot to mention, I played Guitar Freak's V4 this week.
9049407	9051208	I have to say I'm very unimpressed by it.
9052168	9058090	It's just, I don't know, the whole interface and everything looks like a really shoddy PlayStation 2 game.
9059366	9076214	which actually I think the releases of Guitar Freaks are on Playstation 2 so I guess it makes sense but no innovation whatsoever alright well we gotta let you go buddy we're gonna wrap up the show but have a good one okay alright see ya I'm calling to the night later
9078667	9080768	Alright, we're going to close the Skype line for now.
9080828	9089592	If you didn't get through, I'm so sorry, but you can always leave us a voicemail, or, and I've got to catch up on voicemails, probably next week we'll do that, or you can always send us an email, mailbag, orange launch radio dot com.
9089632	9090812	Let's do some last minute stories.
9090933	9091913	Jamie, you said you had a couple.
9092627	9099592	I actually do, and one of them, because I couldn't get the email pulled back up, I found it from another site, but this one was given to me by Rob with two Bs.
9101533	9107957	Time Hollow, which is a Konami game for the DS, is to be localized and released in August.
9109539	9118344	It's actually, the neat thing about the game is that you get this thing called a time pen, which is your stylus, that you use to manipulate time to solve puzzles within the game.
9118384	9121747	It's very, almost sort of Phoenix Wright-ish.
9122967	9135795	and in terms of how it feels or how it plays but you can check either the Japanese website for it which is konami.jp slash time underscore hollow or I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube.
9136914	9164575	and the other thing that's I know a few other anime fans would be excited about this is that Sega grabbed the license for the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya for Nintendo DS actually several of the DS games from Namco Bandai and Sega's like okay we want so you might see those eventually and you can also get the little happy dance that she does oh the Playstation 2 one
9166990	9170431	in the Playstation 2 when she apparently makes her own RPG and then you get to play it.
9172572	9173673	Cool.
9175113	9175573	Very cool.
9176754	9177334	Loki, anything?
9177774	9178955	Of course I have stuff.
9178995	9180935	I have a long laundry list of stuff.
9181215	9181896	Make it quick.
9181956	9182636	We want to go home.
9184242	9194445	Um, anyways, Ubisoft announced a game called I Am Alive, it's like a survival game, looks pretty cool, coming out Spring 2009, and, uh, yeah, I had an awesome trailer for that.
9194925	9208368	Rock Band 2, they announced the full track list for the game, which is pretty awesome, including, uh, there's ACDC, AFI, Lance Morissette, um, Alice in Chains, Bad Company, Beastie Boys, Billy Idol, um...
9209244	9209965	There is Journey.
9211126	9213148	Pretty much one of those rumored lists came true.
9213468	9215810	Yes, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, etc.
9215830	9216851	Fleetwood Mac, awesome.
9217251	9220154	But there is 84 songs that they detailed.
9220374	9224778	And I hear there's going to be 20 more tracks as well, but they're going to be free downloads.
9225984	9227004	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9246215	9252419	The Rockman instruments will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour.
9253079	9254440	So you will actually be able to use them.
9254860	9260503	What they're going to do, since Guitar Hero World Tour has five things you can hit instead of...
9261564	9262844	XBOX 360 Guitar Hero Aerosmith
9284016	9287798	Um, apparently NCAA Football 09 is really broken.
9288518	9304144	They have a laundry list of stuff that's just not working, including some sliders, like the CPU sliders don't do anything, the online Dynasty mode's broken, the Super Sim mode is broken, and kick returns are also broken, and some other crap.
9304204	9305904	So, way to go, EA Sports.
9305984	9308085	Also, I want to see NASCAR 09.
9308785	9310006	The game saves are broken.
9310726	9310967	Sweet.
9312030	9317767	One thing that's kind of interesting is apparently Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had...
9319088	9319268	What?
9319308	9319609	Nice.
9319629	9320249	Interesting.
9320709	9320850	Um...
9346013	9355996	Also, the NPD results for June have come out, and the Wii is now the number one selling system in the US, as well as the world now.
9356137	9363699	So, 10.9 million units with the Xbox 360 trailing behind by just a little bit.
9364019	9365580	So, very interesting.
9367060	9368041	Thank you for watching!
9384807	9388154	There's also rumors that Nintendo might actually be publishing that title.
9388314	9389457	Sonic and Mario World.
9389477	9390158	That would be awesome.
9390178	9391661	That would be kind of interesting there.
9392944	9396151	Miyamoto announced that they're making a Pikmin game.
9397324	9400388	Rhythm Heaven Rhythm Tengoku Gold
9415324	9420067	Samba de Amigo, Sega has confirmed that it will be getting download content.
9421588	9430352	It's actually going to debut some launch content starting on September 23rd when the game is launched.
9430753	9436676	The first set of downloads will include the 80s radio song I Want Candy from Bow Wow Wow.
9437476	9438197	Or Bow Wow Wow.
9438956	9439316	Wow, wow.
9439456	9440036	Yeah, we get it.
9440296	9440616	Too many.
9441437	9444597	Jets, Are You Going to Be My Girl?
9445378	9447338	and Lou Bega's Mambo Mambo.
9448418	9454680	And no word if those are pay-to-unlock content or if it's actually download content, but interesting nonetheless.
9455860	9458261	And let's see here.
9459980	9465745	There was a new unlock code for Supernova 2 cabinets that revealed three more songs.
9466005	9475512	Terra Stars, Jet Girl Spins, Mars Wars 3, and Revenge G Alternative with Reba.
9477233	9479595	Rebata, or however you pronounce that.
9479615	9481577	And then, of course, Paranoid Hades.
9482157	9482718	So that's kind of cool.
9484559	9485700	And let's see here.
9486901	9487461	Real quick...
9490523	9492325	That's a lot of last minute stories.
9492385	9492765	Sorry, sorry.
9492825	9494767	I'm trying to be quick.
9496589	9499212	GPS coming to the PSP within nine months.
9499893	9505419	They're releasing some Famicom inspired classic controllers, so you can import those if you want them.
9506480	9506580	Um...
9508206	9512648	Let's see here... Well, it was E3 week, so it was a little busy this week.
9513108	9514569	Fun little bit of trivia.
9515029	9527195	Animal Crossing, which was being shown off at E3, actually had, of course, none other than Charles Martinet playing the game as well from an undisclosed location with a Mario-style avatar.
9527775	9533918	And he was riffing people in the Mario voice and was also hitting people with axes and complaining about people that ran over his flowers.
9533958	9537140	I'm thinking undisclosed location means backstage, because...
9538140	9546848	I don't know if you remember when they showed off the whole voice chat or the DS internet thing, but they had Charles Martinet in Seattle, right?
9546908	9547369	Remember that?
9547789	9550292	And then you would see him like an hour later walking around the show floor.
9550852	9552434	Yeah, because he could teleport.
9553655	9558579	There is a rumor that someone is working on a PSP emulator for the Wii and they have screenshots.
9558639	9563104	Unfortunately, right now it's only running at about 7 frames per second, but that's still disturbing nonetheless.
9563684	9570228	Animal Crossing will support USB keyboards so you can actually type your messages to people without having to use the Wii remote because that sucked.
9570988	9575210	Gears of War 2 is coming out November 7th this year so people are probably excited about that.
9576151	9580953	LittleBigPlanet is going to allow you to charge users for your content that you created.
9581013	9581674	Oh god.
9583442	9584042	DKS3713 Final Fantasy VII
9600848	9604611	Rock Band 2 is going to be... The release of this is really strange.
9605091	9608413	The game-only version for the Xbox 360 is coming out in September.
9609054	9614878	The bundle, as long as with the PS3 bundle, the PS3 standalone version is coming out in October.
9615418	9616159	And then the Wii...
9617475	9620177	and PlayStation 2 versions I think are coming out in November.
9621138	9624260	Is that confusing enough?
9625821	9627002	And then let's see here.
9627902	9641111	And then my favorite thing, which I'm going to end on here real quick, is that there's a quote taken from G4, apparently it was an interview with Reggie Fils-Aimé, who says, How could you feel left out?
9641492	9644333	The Animal Crossing that we've been hearing about that people wanted...
9645786	9654053	Fully connected to the internet, go to other people's towns, plus I said Grand Theft Auto on the DS, how do you feel left out with those types of announcements?
9654994	9656995	Well, it's quite easy.
9659277	9663621	Because there's about 500 other things you didn't address, but maybe it's just me.
9664402	9665963	I'm not a casual gamer, what do I know?
9666804	9669025	Alright, thank you for the follow-up updates.
9669405	9671145	Although quite lengthy, it was E3 week.
9671165	9672286	There's a lot of shit going on.
9672706	9679167	Next week, I'm sure we'll have a lot of stuff too as the fallout begins from E3 and we start ramping up towards Christmas, as was said earlier.
9679588	9682848	But for now, we go around and we get everybody's final thought.
9683249	9684449	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9685209	9700477	My final thought is, this is actually kind of funny, there's apparently Dead Rising, the Wii version is being called Dead Rising Zombie Sacrifice in Japan, and I don't know if this is true, but for the US version, I heard that they're calling it Dead Rising Chop Until You Drop.
9701437	9702098	Cheesy.
9702578	9703058	I like that.
9703919	9706280	My final thought is, I kind of want a burrito.
9707520	9708561	DarkSakura, your final thought.
9710302	9710402	Uh...
9711661	9715036	Uh-oh, we might have to chop till we drop DarkSakura.
9715056	9716483	She sounds like she's turning into a zombie.
9717639	9746481	that is a distinct possibility alright, until then thank you guys so much for downloading thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and supporting Orange Launcher, do remember if you like what you hear oh sorry, god damn it sorry, I am ending the damn show this is important this is important, real quick DDRX, they're reviving some of their old licensed songs including Dub by Dub and Butterfly I may have mentioned that last week but I don't remember either way, Dubby Dub's coming back
9748072	9748714	Do not want.
9749776	9751600	That might make a headache worse, won't it?
9752402	9753885	I've got a very bad headache right now.
9754106	9754567	I sorry.
9755123	9755403	All right.
9755704	9762910	Well, remember, if you like what you hear, we persevere through the headaches and through the fire and the flames to bring you this program each and every week.
9762970	9764952	Please tell two friends you know about the program.
9764972	9767054	That's how we spread around the world slowly.
9767374	9770056	Hey, we'll see you at PAX in a few weeks, those of you that are going.
9770376	9773519	All three of us are going to be there, and I can't wait to meet you guys.
9773619	9776562	I don't know if there will be an OLR meetup one night, but I imagine we'll do something.
9776882	9777723	It's going to be a party.
9777803	9779845	It's going to be so much fun.
9779905	9780345	Right, Loki?
9780385	9780966	It's so much fun?
9783444	9783704	I don't know.
9783724	9784464	I've never been to PAX.
9786365	9789306	Until then, we'll see you guys next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9789326	9789946	Thank you guys.
9789966	9790706	We'll see you next time.
9807532	9808033	See you next week!
