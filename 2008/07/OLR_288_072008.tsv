0	14000	This is your host, DarkSakura, Sky and Loco!
14000	20480	Tonight July 20th, 2008, at E3, Microsoft announces a Netflix partnership, Sony is set
20480	27760	to launch a new MAG game, and Nintendo announces a Grand Theft Auto portable game.
27760	35000	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge
35000	36000	Radio.
36000	40360	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer
40360	41360	lifestyle.
41360	44080	But we're not cool enough for E3, I'm sorry to say.
44080	48400	No, we just sat here bitter all week long eating our bon-bons and watching it on TV.
48400	49400	Right, DarkSakura?
49400	50400	My lovely coast?
50400	51400	Hell no.
51400	52400	Hell no?
52400	53400	I did other stuff.
53400	54400	Like what?
54400	55400	Going outside?
55400	56400	What's that?
56400	60160	Going to the Classic Gaming Expo, not Classic Gaming Expo, what the hell am I saying?
60160	61560	California Xtreme.
61560	64800	You were thinking about going to Classic Gaming Expo, but you actually went to California
64800	65800	Xtreme.
65800	67960	Classic Gaming Expo is dead as far as I know, so.
67960	69800	I think they're supposed to have it again next year, I'm not sure.
69800	72360	I try to keep tabs on MySpace, but we'll see.
72360	75880	But we'll get more on California Xtreme in just a minute, but it would not be a show
75880	78160	if I could not introduce the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
78160	79160	Hello.
79160	80160	How you doing, Loki?
80160	81160	I'm doing okay.
81160	82160	All right.
82160	83720	Did you, now you did not go to California Xtreme.
83720	85320	No, I did not go to California Xtreme.
85320	87240	What did you do in lieu of E3 this year?
87240	93120	I actually watched E3, watched the press conferences streaming, during work, I might add, because
93120	95280	it technically is work-related, so we sat.
95280	97400	All right, you sell the games, so it's kind of work-related for you.
97400	100160	Yeah, so we, well, yeah, I tried getting that past management.
100160	103120	Luckily, management wasn't there, so we watched it anyways.
103120	104120	Nice.
104120	105640	Yeah, so it was interesting.
105640	106640	All right.
106640	112040	I ended up reading it through blogs, because I, my day job, I teach, not kids, but adults.
112040	118240	I teach in a corporate environment, and so I didn't really have a chance to watch anything
118240	123760	live, so I just had to kind of read it through blogs, but, you know, people had it covered,
123760	127800	I guess, although it would have been more exciting to be there, but, you know, what
127800	128800	can you do?
128800	131760	You can go to a different expo, that's what you can do, and we'll talk more about that
131760	134640	in a little while, but first, let's hear about the trip that Jamie took this week, which
134640	135640	I'm surprised.
135640	139000	Somebody would do a gaming expo the same week as E3, but you went on a little trip,
139000	140000	right?
140000	141000	Yes.
141000	145920	I went on a little trip today for Saturday, I didn't, you know, it ended today, but I
145920	152560	ran into lots of people that I know, including someone in our chat room right now, GS68,
152560	154400	who actually found me.
154400	156840	Nice hat, by the way.
156840	163000	And I ran into Mel and Melody, I ran into Wendell and some of his buddies, and saw a
163000	166040	few other notable personages.
166040	169640	I actually saw Jason Enos in line.
169640	175800	GS68 has actually posted his share of pictures from the event on his little photo bucket
175800	179880	in our chat room, chat.orangelandsradio.com, and what's this I see here, I think this might
179880	180880	be a picture.
180880	183880	Ah, yes, there is Dark Sockar, our very own little space invader.
183880	185880	How do you get a space invader?
185880	186880	Nice.
186880	187880	Melody and I wanted to steal it.
187880	194280	And some other lady with her ass on the table, right next to you.
194280	198520	You might want to crop that picture, GS68, it's very unflattering to the other lady
198520	203160	who looks like she just pooped out a playing card.
203160	204160	Let me link the chat.
204160	207240	I'm sorry, podcast listeners, because you're thinking like, what?
207240	211440	But I have to post this picture because I'm laughing too hard at it.
211440	212440	I look like hell.
212440	214520	Oh, you look fine.
214520	215520	Like hell.
215520	218240	Look, you don't look nearly as bad as the other lady.
218240	221880	All right, enough about- She did poop a playing card.
221880	225800	Look, what kind of games did you get to play at California Extreme?
225800	228480	Okay, let me grab the phone because I took pictures of everything.
228480	233880	You pay a cover fee, right, to get into this thing, and then you just play three arcade
233880	236320	games from the 80s and 90s all day long, right?
236320	238080	And a few more recent ones.
238080	241600	I got an email with- Dude, there's a spider again!
241600	246760	I got an email with a Journey arcade game picture, so I know you played that at least.
246760	250040	I didn't play it, Melody did.
250040	252520	It made part of my soul hurt.
252520	253520	Why?
253520	256840	Because I cried, you know, from nostalgia.
256840	260320	Did she get the- She finally got the concert tried toward the
260320	261320	end of the day.
261320	264080	I was gonna say, you have to get the tape to play.
264080	265080	That's the best part.
265080	266080	Okay, so, games.
266080	271240	I've got a list of stuff I did and did not play.
271240	278000	First of all, they had a demo of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix set up, and they
278000	285840	had a PlayStation 3 set up with the online games, including Puzzle Fighter HD, which
285840	290280	I watched Wendell and Mel play.
290280	295800	Melody and I played Raiden Fighters 2, which was pretty fucking sweet, and I got fifth
295800	296920	highest score.
296920	299760	They had the prop cycle Addams Family there.
299760	300760	What?
300760	304720	You know the people that have the prop cycle set up to play Addams Family?
304720	306040	No, I haven't seen that.
306040	308480	Oh, you have, too, because we commented on it.
308480	309480	Really?
309480	311200	I've seen the prop cycle, but I've never seen it.
311200	312200	Let me see.
312200	313200	Don't drop my phone.
313200	314200	I won't.
314200	318640	Oh, that is kind of strange.
318640	323880	Is actually someone on a prop cycle- A prop cycle attached to an Addams Family,
323880	326400	and the game runs as you pedal.
326400	327400	Huh.
327400	328400	Interesting.
328400	335400	I've had pictures of this set before, so moving on- Oh, that's- My phone's upside down, Rob.
335400	336400	Come on.
336400	337880	Turn back right side up.
337880	338880	Thank you.
338880	341200	Sorry, I had to fix my phone.
341200	342200	Silly iPhone.
342200	348520	Melody played Star Wars Racer Arcade that they had put inside one of these games that
348520	353120	you look into the view hole to do the racing, and I think it was like a submarine or space
353120	356240	game before or something, but it was kind of neat.
356240	360240	They had blasteroids there, which I didn't play, and I was so mad because I took a picture
360240	364440	of a guy in a Big Bang bar shirt, but the picture didn't come out well, and then they
364440	367640	had one of those mini SNK cabinets.
367640	375160	Like there's, if you can see, we had to play on our knees to play it, and we played Puzzle
375160	380760	Bobble, and Melody and I played a sit-down of Crystal Castles, the two-player sit-downs.
380760	381760	Oh, cool.
381760	383760	Like one with a cocktail, yeah.
383760	385560	You set your drink on it.
385560	390560	And then I didn't- Oh, yeah, this is a picture of some dude playing Journey, so-
390560	392720	So is it just arcade game madness or what?
392720	395280	They have these little panels and stuff there, too, right?
395280	396280	Yeah, panels.
396280	402520	Dan went to the panel that had Steve Ritchie, who's the guy who designed some of the best
402520	405260	pins ever, like Twilight Zone and No Fear.
405260	407160	We actually have a lot of the games that he designed.
407160	412040	By the way, they did have Tapper, but I didn't play.
412040	413040	Awesome.
413040	419320	But they, he went to that panel, and then I went to a panel later on with Dan to see
419320	422240	someone talk about customizing.
422240	425320	I'm trying to be understanding because it was his first panel, it just wasn't very well
425320	426320	presented.
426320	430400	I think, you know, with a little bit of experience, he can do better, but there were some interesting
430400	431760	things.
431760	438400	And then we went to a panel about the guy who made Donkey Kong 2, as in he sprite-ripped
438400	443240	and redid levels to have going after the original four in Donkey Kong.
443240	447040	Because I was going to say, wait, Donkey Kong 2 is Donkey Kong Jr., but this is a different
447040	448040	thing.
448040	449480	This is an actual Donkey Kong 2.
449480	450480	Interesting.
450480	456000	Um, you can find the, he actually has a website and everything, but, and then I went to watch
456000	459760	Tilt, but I only watched the first part of it because I've seen the rest of it, but it's
459760	464360	like about the end of Williams Pinball Division and the Pinball 2000 that came out.
464360	466480	I did play some Episode 1 Pinball.
466480	467480	Cool, cool.
467480	471440	But for other games, I had a Gallagher game.
471440	473440	Like the guy who smashes watermelons, Gallagher?
473440	474440	Yes.
474440	477480	And it's like one of those little gun games like Mad Dog McCree was.
477480	478480	Nice.
478480	481280	And, um, do you shoot watermelons and they explode?
481280	482280	No.
482280	485440	Maybe you can shoot flies off of his, off of a lunch.
485440	488600	And I played a sit-down Cinestar.
488600	489600	That's cool.
489600	490600	Very cool.
490600	491600	Beware.
491600	492600	I live.
492600	493600	Yeah.
493600	494600	There was a Burger Time and I played some Gauntlet.
494600	496840	Uh, Junior Pac-Man, uh, Melody played that.
496840	498040	So you played it all.
498040	501600	I mean, there's some, some, some notable, there's a picture of my foot.
501600	506560	Um, I also, um, they had a Big Bang bar, which of course, you know, I had to play Big Bang
506560	507560	bar.
507560	508680	It's a chain, right?
508680	511080	And then, um, Oh, there's my beer.
511080	516320	I also played, um, an eight ball deluxe, which is the set, I think as far, if I'm right,
516320	522640	it's the second highest, um, grossing, um, flipper using pinball table.
522640	525520	The first being Adam's family.
525520	528040	And then I played the Ted Nugent pinball, which was actually really good.
528040	530040	I didn't even know that existed.
530040	534640	Gallagher 98 Pac-Mania, Monopoly, Pango, they're the Pango in a really good condition.
534640	535640	I love Pango.
535640	537600	It's a good, pretty Tron.
537600	542720	Um, how many people were there tons, there was just a lot of people.
542720	547160	Um, although I honestly don't know that the turnout this year was as good as last they
547160	548160	didn't have the auction.
548160	551880	Do you think it might have to do with the fact they're holding at the same time as E3
551880	552880	too?
552880	556400	I don't think that was really their choice because from what I understand, they were
556400	559400	trying to avoid scheduling around the jazz festival in San Jose.
559400	560720	Now this one's a cool one.
560720	563880	If you can see, it's a black Spiderman pinball machine.
563880	566800	They only made, I think 500 of them.
566800	572320	So someone brought it in and if you hit the right flipper button, you can play it in Spanish.
572320	577280	And then there's this guy here who had a Flynn's t-shirt on, which if anyone is a big Tron
577280	582640	nut like me, you know that that's the name of the arcade that, um, the guy had in.
582640	583840	And then this was really cool.
583840	588880	Um, someone took, um, the wizard pinball table, which was the one that Elton John was playing
588880	596520	in, um, in, uh, Tommy and made the big boots and put it up on a stand to play on, like
596520	597520	in Tommy.
597520	598520	All right.
598520	600360	I have to address this because Bobby's saying this in our chat room, chat that orange lounge
600360	603880	radio.com and our old buddy, Bobby black Wolf, who's on before us and all games.com.
603880	607520	He says it wasn't the same time as E3, E3 ended Thursday.
607520	609600	If anything, it made it easier for someone to attend it.
609600	611520	It just, they could just hop up after E3.
611520	615080	But I'm thinking like, okay, I've been to E3 in the past, granted it was a lot different
615080	616080	back then.
616080	617640	I know how I felt at the end of E3.
617640	619280	I didn't want to do shit.
619280	623720	The idea of another gaming expo was like the furthest thing from my mind.
623720	626600	If somebody had told me, Hey, let's go to a gaming expo tomorrow, it would be like,
626600	628840	you've got to be kidding me.
628840	633520	So I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I'm thinking, you know, it's a little too close
633520	634520	together.
634520	635520	You got to give it at least a month.
635520	640080	Uh, it would have been really tight and I just have to say the one day of me going,
640080	646560	um, all granted, I didn't have, um, my, the medication that I have to take, but, um, I,
646560	653720	I got so tired just walking around and, um, cause we, we left the house at, at, uh, at
653720	658680	10 and we got there just a little bit afternoon, um, actually closer to one.
658680	662520	So Dan could hit, hit that panel he wanted to go to.
662520	670320	Um, but just walking around all day, just all day walking and I was pretty much dead
670320	671320	tired.
671320	672480	I did nothing but sleep today.
672480	673800	You better prepare yourself for packs.
673800	675160	That's going to be three days.
675160	676640	I'm going to bring better shoes.
676640	677640	All right.
677640	678640	Oh my God.
678640	679640	Shoes.
679640	680640	All right.
680640	681640	Oh my God.
681640	682640	Shoes.
682640	683640	Thank you for the lovely report.
683640	684640	I'm sure we'll hear more from Dan later.
684640	685640	Possibly.
685640	686640	Um, well no.
686640	687640	All right.
687640	688640	But go to our forum.
688640	695440	Um, in our, um, our orange lounge chat area, I did post up a, uh, the review that Dan wrote
695440	701040	for us since we have nowhere on the front page to do it yet yet.
701040	702440	All right.
702440	705600	Um, but Dan, Dan wrote a lengthy review.
705600	711040	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week while you weren't attending any cool expos like the
711040	712040	cool kids?
712040	713840	Um, it was okay.
713840	716400	Like um, all right.
716400	720200	So I played the Tales of Vesperia demo, which was released this week.
720200	721200	Very pitiful.
721200	725160	I might say that they only released two demos during their bringing it home.
725160	726160	Oh yeah.
726160	727160	You brought it home.
727160	728160	All right.
728160	729160	Woo wee.
729160	732520	I'm not as enthusiastic as the rest of the event went.
732520	734800	Um, Tales of Vesperia.
734800	736100	I didn't like it.
736100	737600	I really wanted to like it.
737600	741400	I already had it preordered, you know, it looked like a game I could probably get into
741400	744720	kind of like, you know, eternal Sonata or something like that.
744720	750520	I just, what did it for me is I didn't like really the, I thought it was a little cheesy
750520	753260	and I mean the graphics are awesome.
753260	755560	The graphics are just like eternal Sonata.
755560	756560	Yeah.
756560	757560	Combat was kind of annoying.
757560	763560	I didn't like the combat one bit that kind of ruined it for me.
763560	768720	Um, it's all kind of real time and you switch between your characters and you cast spells
768720	772360	and stuff and everyone kind of is on autopilot, which kind of sucked.
772360	777840	Um, I liked eternal Sonata a lot better where it was turn based and you could do all that
777840	779840	real time stuff within like a certain time limit.
779840	784680	I thought that was pretty cool, but this was kind of all over the place.
784680	789240	And um, then my buddy played Too Human.
789240	792840	I didn't get a chance to play it because I tried downloading the demo twice, both times
792840	794220	it was corrupted.
794220	796040	So that was awesome.
796040	798080	And here it was just mediocre.
798080	802160	So I don't know, but he's going to buy it because he liked, you know, games like Conan
802160	805120	and stuff like that, which, you know, I kind of like that too.
805120	808200	It doesn't really take much to impress me as far as action games go.
808200	810400	I mean, I don't know.
810400	817160	But um, I did play some DS games, I played Metal Slug 7 a bit and I didn't really play
817160	820780	the main game of it because I mean, shit, it's just Metal Slug.
820780	824120	But they had these like challenge mode things in there and that was kind of interesting.
824120	828480	You had different tasks and once you finish those, you go up in rank and stuff like that
828480	829600	and it gets harder.
829600	833080	So that, that's kind of cool with the added replayability.
833080	839900	And then I played, um, more point blank DS, which the DS, I don't know.
839900	844040	At first it was pretty fun with the DS stylus, but it's just not as accurate as firing the
844040	845340	gun.
845340	847640	So it's kind of frustrating at times because you're tapping.
847640	851120	That's strange because I would think when you tap, you're tapping right on it, whereas
851120	852560	exactly button.
852560	856440	But sometimes the, I don't know if they had a calibration option or whatever, but it wasn't
856440	857800	exact.
857800	859960	So that was kind of annoying.
859960	862520	And um, what else did I play?
862520	867800	I tried some more of a portal still live, which was that DS, or actually it's still
867800	872200	live DS, I guess, which is that little, uh, like portal game, the 2D one.
872200	875320	That was kind of fun, short.
875320	879080	Um, and what else did I play?
879080	880560	I think that was pretty much it.
880560	882560	I was just kind of going all over the place.
882560	887760	Oh, I went back to play some old Xbox live arcade games, played Zuma some more, because
887760	888760	that's fun.
888760	889760	Nelly's cool.
889760	892320	Because now that I have it hooked up to the TV again, Nelly's like, oh, Zuma, I can play
892320	893320	this again.
893320	894320	So.
894320	895320	All right.
895320	900160	Sounds, sounds like you were keeping yourself busy with what you already have, games you
900160	901160	already have to beat.
901160	902160	Exactly.
902160	904920	And it's just like looking at, you know, there was stuff that came out this week, you know,
904920	908840	Xbox live arcade stuff, but just like, all of it sucked.
908840	914720	And uh, ooh, Tuesday, this Tuesday, my DS, I gotta dust it off with what's coming out
914720	915720	this Tuesday.
915720	918160	I'll tell you later in the show when we get to release dates.
918160	921520	However, uh, my gaming week, I'll keep it short, um, because there really wasn't a lot
921520	922520	to it.
922520	926400	It was the same stuff I've been playing, Civ Rev, uh, Space Invaders stream on PSP, but
926400	928240	I had a little bit of renaissance as well.
928240	933320	I, uh, when I saw Nintendo's press conference and, and some of the games they were debuting,
933320	936740	I was like, wow, this looks pretty much the same as, as GameCube stuff.
936740	942040	So I went back to the GameCube and I decided I wanted to play Animal Crossing again.
942040	946040	So I started a brand new town in Animal Crossing and started from the top.
946040	947360	And um, it's so funny.
947360	949760	I think my roommate, uh, summed it up perfectly.
949760	953120	He walked in on me playing the game this morning after I'd played it a little bit yesterday.
953120	957200	He's like, what's the point of this game?
957200	959120	He's kind of like, why do you like this game?
959120	960640	It seems like there's no point.
960640	962360	And I'm like, you're kind of right.
962360	963760	There is no point.
963760	964760	That's the point.
964760	966040	It's like the Sims.
966040	968880	There's no real point to that either.
968880	972800	But I thought I would, uh, play it to try and collect more of the NES games.
972800	975840	Cause remember that was one awesome thing about Animal Crossing on the GameCube is that
975840	978080	it had all the old school NES games buried in it.
978080	979960	Like you could get like Clu Clu Land.
979960	981200	How awesome is that?
981200	983920	And Donkey Kong Jr. Math.
983920	986720	Neither of those games on Virtual Console if I remember right.
986720	988400	So there you have it.
988400	992160	Um, and then I also, I'll tell you what, cause I was talking about it last week.
992160	993160	I made good on this.
993160	997640	I started playing F-Zero GX on the GameCube again cause that is a great racing game.
997640	1001300	Boy I wish they would make a high def version of that cause that would be a lot of fun.
1001300	1004640	The cool thing is the GameCube version supports widescreen and progressive scan.
1004640	1009560	So it's already outputting, you know, pretty much the same level that other Wii games would.
1009560	1012680	You know, granted the slightly more advanced Wii hardware would probably make a better
1012680	1013680	F-Zero game.
1013680	1017360	But I want to see something like F-Zero on like 720, 1080 level.
1017360	1019080	That would be awesome.
1019080	1020440	Was that like F-Zero?
1020440	1022920	That's a fun racing game.
1022920	1026400	And I was a little sad they didn't announce that, a new F-Zero game at their press conference.
1026400	1027440	But what can you do?
1027440	1034080	But you have to understand the E3 wasn't for the core gamer, uh, for at least Nintendo.
1034080	1038320	So all the stuff that they announced was casual stuff, right?
1038320	1043320	Uh, GameGuru in chat, chat.org.com does correct me and says Donkey Kong Junior Math is on
1043320	1046120	the Virtual Console, but it's not worth $5.
1046120	1047120	Correct.
1047120	1051800	It's not worth $5 considering you can get an Animal Crossing for free, there you have
1051800	1052800	it.
1052800	1058480	So, alright, um, let's get into some gaming news after we talk about some housekeeping.
1058480	1063040	Uh, this week as we announced at our own E3 press conference last week, you will get one
1063040	1067440	big show, hopefully everything on the technical end works, but you will get one big show.
1067440	1070760	There will no longer be part A and B, so the podcast feed might look a little different
1070760	1074320	because of that, but that'll be pretty cool.
1074320	1075320	And that's it.
1075320	1081480	Otherwise, continue to support us by giving us positive reviews on iTunes, we always appreciate
1081480	1082480	that.
1082480	1085440	There's been a few new ones that have popped up lately, some nice, very nice five star
1085440	1086440	reviews.
1086440	1090160	In fact, right now, if I checked correctly, we have exactly 69 reviews on iTunes right
1090160	1091760	now, which is a great number to be at.
1091760	1092760	So thank you very much.
1092760	1095520	Make some more, as nice as the 69 number is.
1095520	1096960	So don't forget that.
1096960	1101960	Also, our LiveJournal community, we are at community Orange Lounge on LiveJournal, so
1101960	1102960	look us up there.
1102960	1109120	Facebook, OL Army, on Myspace at Orange Lounge Radio, so we are your social networking BFFs
1109120	1112040	on any of those sites you want to be our buds on.
1112040	1114000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
1114000	1118000	This week a little different, um, because we had E3 happen this week, nothing but press
1118000	1120320	conference stuff in this, uh, half of the show.
1120320	1123440	We're going to talk about kind of the big three press conferences, and our thoughts
1123440	1124440	on it.
1124440	1128340	Since I'm assuming a lot of you have probably already heard the news, let's try to dissect
1128340	1129340	it a little bit tonight.
1129340	1130560	Loke, you want to start us off.
1130560	1136480	Okay, so of course the big last minute thing that they did for the Xbox, um, or Microsoft
1136480	1142200	conference was announcing that Final Fantasy 13 would be coming to the Xbox 360 day and
1142200	1149600	date in the US, which, you know, is a big, you know, blow to PS3's exclusive, uh, content.
1149600	1154160	In fact, if I remember correctly, I believe the three games that they wanted, uh, to break
1154160	1160280	exclusivity on was Grand Theft Auto 4, Final Fantasy 13, and Metal Gear Solid 4.
1160280	1166680	Well, two out of three ain't bad, so, um, yeah, that's a pretty big thing, I think.
1166680	1172760	Um, it is not going to be coming, it's not exclusive in, or not coming to, uh, the Xbox
1172760	1175120	360 in Japan, though.
1175120	1176120	Interesting.
1176120	1179560	But in the, um, US, it will be coming out day and date, so.
1179560	1184400	Which really kind of shows that this whole move is motivated nothing by but sales, basically
1184400	1186560	that they feel they have a better chance of penetrating the marketplace.
1186560	1187880	I think so, yeah.
1187880	1188880	Very interesting.
1188880	1193920	But I, my curiosity is how long is this, is it going to make this game be out?
1193920	1196720	I mean, like, how far do we have to wait for this game?
1196720	1200720	Because they admitted, they haven't even really started developing this game for the 360.
1200720	1204240	I mean, they've been doing it on some type of PC design, like what do they call it, Crystal
1204240	1205240	or something?
1205240	1207080	They do it on, you know, it's probably their own design platform.
1207080	1211680	Sure, I mean, I think here's the thing, it's not really going to be an issue with storage,
1211680	1214520	it's not going to be a problem, you know, getting it, obviously it's not going to be
1214520	1216200	on one disc, but that's fine.
1216200	1219760	Um, I think it's actually not going to hold them up too much because it's a lot easier
1219760	1225240	to develop for the 360 than it is for the PS3, and I know that Square Enix has a lot
1225240	1232160	more, um, experience developing for the 360 right now, rather than the PS3, so.
1232160	1236080	I don't think it's really going to hold it up any more than localizing it would.
1236080	1240480	Uh, Maysatsuma in chat asked the question that I've been actually getting asked a lot
1240480	1245200	this week because I've been pretty open on this show that I have, I had no plans to get
1245200	1249240	a PlayStation 3 until Final Fantasy 13 came out, so now this is a, you know, a question
1249240	1251720	I've been getting a lot this week, as I'm sure a lot of people like me have.
1251720	1256320	Uh, Maysatsuma says, will you have a PS, I'm sorry, will you buy a PS3 now?
1256320	1260040	You always said you'll buy a PS3 when Final Fantasy 13 comes out.
1260040	1264000	Um, not for this, now, I don't need to.
1264000	1269160	The question is, will Sony be able to land other exclusives, Kingdom, that I am interested
1269160	1274120	in, like Kingdom Hearts 3, possibly Final Fantasy 13 versus whatever else is coming
1274120	1275120	out that I haven't thought of yet.
1275120	1278840	I imagine eventually I'm going to want that Blu-ray player, just because that's where
1278840	1281840	the video place is, and, you know, I'm one of those people that, well, as long as I'm
1281840	1285240	going to get a Blu-ray player, but I see no need to run out and buy one now.
1285240	1288960	It's, in fact, if I had ran out and bought one, and a lot of people are feeling this
1288960	1294120	thing, if I had ran out and bought one for Final Fantasy 13 before, I would be hurting
1294120	1295120	right now.
1295120	1299600	I would be hurting, not only was, you know, is Sony likely to come down in price on those
1299600	1303120	systems later, and we'll hear more about that later, I'm sure, but, you know.
1303120	1308080	Well, the thing I think also, too, you have to look at is, from the publisher's standpoint,
1308080	1311360	when they put this game out, and it's not even necessarily this game, because I'm thinking
1311360	1315720	Last Remnant's going to be out way before this, I mean, when that comes out, they're
1315720	1320760	going to look at the sales of that game on both consoles, and, if it's anything like
1320760	1324920	Grand Theft Auto IV was, it's going to be a lot more on the 360 than it is on the PS3.
1324920	1329040	Now, that may not be the case, obviously it's not going to be the case in Japan, but they
1329040	1333800	have to look at each market separately, and kind of base their decisions on that, because
1333800	1338960	if they were just to base it all on, you know, the Japanese market, then we wouldn't be getting
1338960	1341040	anything on the 360.
1341040	1344880	I got two questions, first is for Jamie, because I haven't heard anything yet, and I know you
1344880	1348880	like Final Fantasy like the rest of us, what was your reaction to the news?
1348880	1351640	I really didn't care.
1351640	1352640	Right.
1352640	1354200	I have both systems.
1354200	1359720	That leads into my next question, that you and Loki own both systems, knowing that Final
1359720	1363200	Fantasy XIII, I guess you could say for all practical purposes, was being designed for
1363200	1367860	the PlayStation 3, now it's coming out for the 360, do you think you're more inclined
1367860	1371740	to get it on PlayStation 3, or what system do you think you might ultimately get this
1371740	1372740	game on?
1372740	1374040	Or have you even decided yet?
1374040	1379200	Probably PS3, because if that's what it was designed for, then that's what it was designed
1379200	1383960	for, but it doesn't mean that, you know, later on I won't pick it up dirt cheap for Xbox
1383960	1384960	360.
1384960	1386840	I mean, depends on features.
1386840	1387840	Loki?
1387840	1391080	I couldn't care less what system it was originally designed for, if it's coming out on the 360
1391080	1395440	and buying it on the 360, and that's just because I like the achievement system that
1395440	1399440	they have in place, I don't give a shit about these fucking trophies.
1399440	1403800	There are PlayStation 3 exclusive games I'm gonna be buying for the PS3, but it's pretty
1403800	1408600	much, if it's coming out on the 360 and the PS3, I will always be picking it up on the
1408600	1409600	360.
1409600	1412840	What if they come out and say, you know what, the 360 version did have to take a little
1412840	1413840	hit in quality?
1413840	1414840	I don't care.
1414840	1415840	I mean, it's gonna...
1415840	1416840	Wow.
1416840	1421120	Well, now if I were you, if I heard one iota of the 360's gonna have to sacrifice something,
1421120	1422120	I'd pick it up on PS3.
1422120	1423120	I mean, look at...
1423120	1424660	I don't give a shit about achievements, so...
1424660	1429580	Name one game out there that runs better on the PS3 than the 360.
1429580	1430640	There isn't one.
1430640	1432360	It's always the other way around.
1432360	1436240	Sony Fanboys and chat.orangethesontraday.com, please.
1436240	1439560	I hear oblivion's a little bit graphically better, but I don't know, that's...
1439560	1445800	Yeah, but we're talking, like, marginally, I mean, like, this isn't gonna be, you know,
1445800	1451180	breaking any sort of, you know, there's no discernible difference in between the two.
1451180	1455800	You have to really, I mean, look at all the games that come out now and they do that stupid
1455800	1459540	comparison between the 360 and PS3 versions.
1459540	1465040	There's, like, minimal differences, unless, you know, you're talking, you know, when the
1465040	1469900	PS3 version comes out and there's, like, lag issues, frame rate issues, freezing issues
1469900	1472400	and stuff like that.
1472400	1473400	I don't know.
1473400	1479880	It's just, it's not worth picking up on the PS3 for.
1479880	1484320	Now, not to say that, like I said, there's stuff on the PS3 I definitely want.
1484320	1486200	Resistance Fall Man 2.
1486200	1488280	Fuck yeah, I will be getting that on the PS3.
1488280	1491360	All right, a couple people, a couple comments in chat, I know Jamie wants to say something
1491360	1492360	too.
1492360	1497000	Burnout Paradise is a game that's being mentioned, and Joshi16 gives the lulz with Metal Gear
1497000	1498520	Solid 4 plays better.
1498520	1501360	Yeah, but Burnout Paradise, okay, look at Burnout Paradise.
1501360	1503520	Hold on, let's let Jamie say it, because she wants to say something, I'm gonna go.
1503520	1508640	I was just gonna say, still, all of that actually means really nothing to me, because I had
1508640	1513000	already decided to get it on, you know, I had kept it in my head open that if it came
1513000	1519240	out on Xbox 360, I don't, first of all, it's not coming out in Japan on Xbox 360.
1519240	1521440	They're not going to get the release.
1521440	1526880	So this means that I can actually interact with a larger community on the PS3 version,
1526880	1527880	first of all.
1527880	1535200	I don't care about achievements, and I really don't care about going online, so, I mean,
1535200	1539820	I would be able to find more stuff, you know, a larger community, especially for me who
1539820	1545240	loves the fan side of it, that and, you know, honestly think that the controller scheme
1545240	1548600	lends itself better to RPGs on the PlayStation than on Xbox.
1548600	1551080	But the controller scheme's almost identical, I mean, we're talking like-
1551080	1554500	I've heard the control thing before, is that the PlayStation, I would even, you know, even
1554500	1558060	though I'm kinda not getting a PS3, I would agree that the PlayStation 3's got a better
1558060	1561420	controller than the 360, but I don't mind the 360's controller.
1561420	1567080	They're both, I mean, we're talking like the analog stick being moved in place of the directional
1567080	1569360	pad, I mean, that means absolutely nothing.
1569360	1571760	I don't know, there's something about the stability.
1571760	1572760	I'm sorry, I-
1572760	1575560	And as far as the online community goes, what's that have to do with platforms?
1575560	1579320	I mean, when people are playing like Grand Theft Auto 4 or something like that, the community
1579320	1580320	is-
1580320	1581320	The other half of the fun for me is-
1581320	1583240	The games are identical in both systems.
1583240	1587120	The other half of the fun for me is actually going on international sites and seeing what
1587120	1589680	the, you know, the world reaction is.
1589680	1594820	I love looking at fan art, I love, you know, finding fan sites, I think it's fun.
1594820	1597320	But that's fine, but that's not platform specific.
1597320	1599600	You're not gonna only have PS3 fans.
1599600	1600600	That doesn't necessarily-
1600600	1605320	That'd be like, you know, saying, for example, that, you know, you have fans for Eternal
1605320	1609400	Sonata, but there's gonna be fans for the PS3 and the Xbox 360 version.
1609400	1612300	It doesn't matter, as long as you're playing it.
1612300	1615720	People are playing the game, it doesn't matter what platform choice they have, there's still
1615720	1618320	gonna be fans out there, and the community's still gonna be out there, regardless of what
1618320	1620960	system you pick it up on.
1620960	1625720	It doesn't, like, lock you into an exclusive fan club that only 360 fans can, you know,
1625720	1628680	visit people that play the 360 stuff versus PS3.
1628680	1633360	Alright, let me let the chat have the last word here.
1633360	1637880	Osfer says, isn't Versus 13 still exclusive to the PS3 in the US?
1637880	1640740	Even if it is, I'm sure that game will jump ship too.
1640740	1645280	Sales will probably be a big question as to whether that happens or not, I'd imagine.
1645280	1648560	Well, Versus 13, I don't think it's been announced for the US yet.
1648560	1652200	It's still Japanese only, and if that's the case, then yeah, it probably still is PS3.
1652200	1655880	And well, they showed the trailer at E3 a couple years ago, so I'm thinking it's gonna
1655880	1656880	be good.
1656880	1661080	Yeah, but they also showed the trailer for Star Ocean, like, two years ago too, so.
1661080	1665760	As Separoth1215 and Xenocore agree, say the D-pad on the 360 is what's horrible, and I
1665760	1669960	agree, you cannot, that D-pad on 360 is awful.
1669960	1674060	That's the problem with the controller right there, is that D-pad, because I don't like
1674060	1678320	to use the analog stick with a lot of Xbox Live arcade games, and that D-pad sucks.
1678320	1681400	Like, especially for, like, the retro games, and fighters.
1681400	1686360	That's the thing, that's what the PlayStation 3 controller, I think, is better as fighters.
1686360	1687360	But...
1687360	1691720	You know what, if they wanted to take a clue from the best controller ever made, they should
1691720	1697840	look at the Sega Saturn dual analog controller for their model.
1697840	1701640	I like the Super Nintendo controller, it was a lot less complicated, but I...
1701640	1705960	Well, the Super Nintendo controller, though, is also one of the, I think, the primary inspirations
1705960	1707480	for the PlayStation controller.
1707480	1708480	True, true.
1708480	1711720	Well, I'm sorry that you'll be handicapped when you get to the fighting game portions
1711720	1712720	of Final Fantasy 13.
1712720	1713720	Alright, shut up.
1713720	1714720	We're moving on.
1714720	1715720	Alright.
1715720	1720560	Uh, other big news out of Microsoft's press conference, that has to do with the installation
1720560	1723480	of Xbox 360 games to your hard drive.
1723480	1726880	They actually announced that now you're going to be able to actually copy the games to your
1726880	1729600	hard drive, so you can play the games directly off your hard drive.
1729600	1733720	But if you're thinking this means, haha, I can get them from Gamefly, copy them to my
1733720	1738440	hard drive and send them back, no, you still have to have the original disc to play the
1738440	1739440	game.
1739440	1741320	I'm curious how long that takes to get cracked, though.
1741320	1742320	Yeah, not long.
1742320	1746760	I'm curious because people could probably burn their own CDs and bypass it.
1746760	1749720	I'm very interested to see how they security lock this.
1749720	1751320	We'll see, we'll see.
1751320	1756920	Also, you're going to be able to access the marketplace on the web, so if you, you know,
1756920	1760920	you're not next to the 360, you're, you know, surfing the internet at work like you shouldn't
1760920	1764580	be, you can actually go on the internet and queue up downloads to automatically go to
1764580	1767200	your 360, which sounds kind of interesting.
1767200	1770240	Something pretty awesome is if they had, like, a mode, and they have this, I think, with
1770240	1776720	a PS3 a little bit, where you can access your content from, you know, any hotspot or something
1776720	1780940	like that, but what if you could, like, say, leave your 360 in, like, a standby mode and
1780940	1786540	queue something up to download on your 360 from a PC that's, you know, nowhere near it
1786540	1790720	and then actually have it downloaded while you're out, you know what I mean?
1790720	1791720	Right.
1791720	1795000	So, I guess that's kind of cool, though, if you, you know, don't like all those loading
1795000	1796720	times on Xbox 360 on certain games.
1796720	1800240	It doesn't, it doesn't sound like it's gonna really help the load times too much, it's
1800240	1803200	only gonna improve them by 30% from what I read.
1803200	1804200	Hmm.
1804200	1805200	Interesting.
1805200	1806200	But, I mean.
1806200	1808000	What games do you think will benefit most from this?
1808000	1811040	You can even do multi-disc installs, though, apparently, like, if you want to install,
1811040	1814160	like, disc 2 and 3 of Lost Odyssey on your drive, you could do that.
1814160	1816080	I don't know why you would, but you could.
1816080	1822560	Let me, it's nice that it's an option, you know, that's nice in case you want to do that
1822560	1824840	and you don't have to, but.
1824840	1829480	It would be nicer if I didn't have to have the original disc, but I, I mean, granted,
1829480	1833120	I understand why they're doing it that way, if they didn't, piracy would run rampant,
1833120	1837240	but I wish there was some other type of way it could be validated that I actually own
1837240	1841360	and bought the game, because I would love to just, you know, not have to swap discs
1841360	1844840	out all the time, like, just pop up a menu on my 360, pick the game and go.
1844840	1846000	Like the arcade games.
1846000	1847000	I love that.
1847000	1849160	It would be nice, but I, I mean, I understand why that's.
1849160	1852880	Well, they could do that, but, you know.
1852880	1855400	Maybe authenticate, authenticating with a serial number or something.
1855400	1858280	Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, like a serial key, just like they do with MMOs and
1858280	1859280	PC games.
1859280	1860280	Question mark, I don't know.
1860280	1862200	Xbox, think about that for next year's E3.
1862200	1863800	I would love to be able to do that.
1863800	1868120	It seems to me that the, the key code would probably be the best way.
1868120	1871640	But that's also a problem too, like if you look, I know this is a small market, but rental
1871640	1876120	market, you know, if you're renting it out with the manual and the key codes in there,
1876120	1877120	then.
1877120	1878120	Yeah.
1878120	1880120	Yeah, we'll see.
1880120	1887360	Well, for anyone who's been looking for a sequel to Portal, there is an official one.
1887360	1889400	It's actually Portal Still Alive.
1889400	1896960	It's going to be basically the, the single player story that was in Orange Box with some
1896960	1897960	new challenges.
1897960	1900320	It's supposed to be on the Xbox Live Arcade.
1900320	1903080	Nothing about PC or PS3.
1903080	1905000	I think they already have this on the PC actually.
1905000	1910440	They released a map pack that was based off the Flash Portal game, the 2D one, and that's
1910440	1911800	what these levels are.
1911800	1915600	Those are those same levels that were available on the PC, I want to say for free, so.
1915600	1919680	But they've been, uh, la-di-daing this thing as an exclusive on the 360, right?
1919680	1924720	It is exclusive on the 360, this version of the game, like as a standalone thing, but
1924720	1929840	it really, it's just those download maps that were available on the PC for free.
1929840	1931240	You know what though I hear about this game?
1931240	1932240	There's no GLaDOS.
1932240	1934560	That kind of makes me sad, but.
1934560	1935560	That's sadness.
1935560	1936560	It is sadness.
1936560	1938360	But hopefully there will still be cake.
1938360	1942340	Maybe this time, Jamie, maybe there's pie at the end this time.
1942340	1943440	But there's no story.
1943440	1945600	It's just challenge levels.
1945600	1947920	It's like the VR missions and.
1947920	1952000	I guess, Jamie, you were, you were quite the fan of Portal and I think a lot of the reason
1952000	1954660	you liked it was the humor in it and the story, right?
1954660	1959820	Does this kind of, I don't know, to me this seems a little bit milking, but I, I enjoyed
1959820	1961160	the game in Portal 2.
1961160	1962160	I really did.
1962160	1964680	So, but I'm kind of curious, what do you think about this?
1964680	1969160	Being that there's kind of less story, more just puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.
1969160	1972120	For the people who like the puzzle, puzzle, puzzle, that's good for them.
1972120	1973840	I just want snarky commentary.
1973840	1977560	If there's no snarky commentary, then.
1977560	1979240	But you could make your own.
1979240	1980240	You know what?
1980240	1982720	I'll let Dan play it and then I'll provide the snarky commentary.
1982720	1983720	Alright.
1983720	1984720	You know what would make this game awesome?
1984720	1985720	What?
1985720	1991040	But they're, well, other than cake, is if later on for a few more Microsoft points they
1991040	1996400	could release a level editor for the, you know, arcade game and then release it where
1996400	1997640	you can share levels.
1997640	2000240	But then what would they do for the actual Portal 2?
2000240	2001540	For the actual Portal 2?
2001540	2002540	I don't know.
2002540	2006080	Well, I mean, this might be Portal 2, but you know what I'm talking about, like a Portal
2006080	2008080	actual full sequel with story editing.
2008080	2009800	Well, they can add some additional elements.
2009800	2015720	I think for the Portal PC game they had levels and stuff with alternate gravity sections
2015720	2018280	where you're actually on the ceiling and stuff like that.
2018280	2020360	Really twisty, weird stuff.
2020360	2024240	So if they add that into Portal 2, and I think Portal 2 is supposed to be kind of different
2024240	2028120	than Portal 1 altogether, you know, kind of a different environment, more like Half-Life,
2028120	2031520	then, yeah, there's a lot more to do.
2031520	2034560	Maybe the lesser face is supposed to be in Half-Life 3.
2034560	2038440	Plus there's, like, the guy that sounds like Colonel Sanders in there, so.
2038440	2040320	Oh, the G-Man?
2040320	2048600	No, no, the new guy, the new Ghost of Portal, you know, creator guy or whatever.
2048600	2052880	The one whose initials that you enter into the website to do the test that you can't
2052880	2053880	save the result of.
2053880	2054880	I guess.
2054880	2059680	SSJ100 Matt says in chat, they better give a free Carvel cake coupon with the new Portal
2059680	2060680	because they lied to us last time.
2060680	2061680	That would be funny.
2061680	2063580	That would be great.
2063580	2068280	And some folks in chat are imagining the play at home with Dark Soccer making the commentary
2068280	2069880	to Dan while he's playing.
2069880	2075200	Joshi16 says, Dark Soccer to Dan, play better!
2075200	2078840	And ActDef says, complete the puzzle or the cube dies!
2078840	2081480	No, no, no.
2081480	2084640	Half the time with Dan playing is me just trying to shut up because I figured it out
2084640	2088560	the puzzle, only I get too motion sick to do it.
2088560	2090760	So I'll be sitting there going, hmm, and he'll be like, what?
2090760	2094400	I'll be like, you should have done the portal over there, because then it'll come up over
2094400	2096840	here, and if you do it this way, then this will happen.
2096840	2100080	He's like, oh.
2100080	2103880	He has that little, what I call the Charlie Brown cloud with a little cloud of steam over
2103880	2105400	their head, like they always got new cartoons.
2105400	2107520	I have to just bite my lip and not say anything.
2107520	2108520	Ow.
2108520	2111360	Alright, anyway, moving on.
2111360	2118720	Alright, well, other news coming out of the Microsoft press conference saying, no, this
2118720	2124360	was a total shock, because this was kept under super secret wraps.
2124360	2132840	Lips, their new karaoke game was announced, and they had a lot of details on that, including
2132840	2134040	some pretty cool stuff.
2134040	2139800	Obviously, the microphones are going to be motion sensitive, and they're wireless, as
2139800	2141800	they should be.
2141800	2146840	They've got kind of like this little light thing on the bottom there, I guess that responds
2146840	2152360	to your voice, and they're really making this pretty much pick up and play, so if you want
2152360	2157800	to join in with someone singing karaoke, all you have to do is really just shake the mic.
2157800	2162120	And during the song, you can kind of tap the mic like you do in Rock Band to make a cymbal
2162120	2165960	noise and stuff like that, and I hear also other people that may be in the room and stuff
2165960	2170200	can pick up other controllers and hit the buttons on there and make music with that
2170200	2171200	as well.
2171200	2174300	So, eat that, we music.
2174300	2175560	This sounds interesting.
2175560	2177080	I'm down with Lips.
2177080	2180000	It looks a lot like SingStar to me, but I think SingStar is kind of fun.
2180000	2182780	It looks like, you know, this is Microsoft's thing.
2182780	2187360	They take other people's ideas and make them better, and well, granted, it's not Microsoft
2187360	2191240	themselves doing this as the Elite Beat Agents folks, but hey, I love Elite Beat Agents.
2191240	2192720	It looks pretty cool.
2192720	2193720	This will be a karaoke game.
2193720	2196800	There is some other cool stuff about that too.
2196800	2201880	They were saying that the music in this, you can actually hook up your, like an iPod or
2201880	2207480	any other music player, Zoom, whatever, and it will allow you to stream any songs that
2207480	2210860	you have on there, as long as they're not DRM'd.
2210860	2213760	You can use just normal mp3s and stuff like that.
2213760	2219880	The program actually performs like a vocal reduction on your own songs, and you can actually
2219880	2222760	be scored on your own songs as well.
2222760	2228240	Some other stuff that they had saying that they're not sure if they're going to allow
2228240	2232940	you to stream, like say, your library if you have a PC connected on your network.
2232940	2234600	You know, you can stream music usually.
2234600	2239320	Not sure if they're going to allow you to do that.
2239320	2244320	And also, no word if you're going to actually be able to implement your own lyrics or song
2244320	2246480	chart or something like that.
2246480	2249080	But they had some interesting ideas, I guess.
2249080	2251380	Some of the songs confirmed for it already.
2251380	2260080	They had Mercy by Duffy, Young Folk by Peter and, oh I guess, Peter, Bjorn, and Jon, and
2260080	2261320	Bust A Move by Young MC.
2261320	2267700	And I guess all the songs are master tracks and contain their original music videos.
2267700	2269440	And rap songs work a little bit different.
2269440	2273220	I guess it's not just about the rhythm in the game.
2273220	2275040	So it's kind of cool they have rap and singing and all that stuff.
2275040	2278640	I can't wait to rap.
2278640	2281920	Hopefully we can get Loki to rap and put it on YouTube somewhere.
2281920	2283480	Ahhh, no.
2283480	2286760	Alright, are you excited about Lips?
2286760	2287760	No.
2287760	2288760	Alright.
2288760	2290600	You're not a karaoke fan, right?
2290600	2291600	Not really.
2291600	2292600	Alright, well I'll buy it.
2292600	2293600	I'll admit it.
2293600	2294600	I like karaoke.
2294600	2298400	I'm just hoping that it reads on my ABBA CDs correctly.
2298400	2300120	Well, exactly.
2300120	2303240	Because if you can put in your own music, we're having ABBA night.
2303240	2307720	Well, what they should do is they should have it where you can plug in, you know, how they
2307720	2311920	have the CDDB and stuff like that where you can pop in CDs and it'll, you know, detect
2311920	2313880	what songs it is and stuff like that.
2313880	2319240	If you could do that, say, with this game as well with MP3s, and it'll detect what song
2319240	2322000	it is and automatically download the lyrics, that'd be pretty awesome.
2322000	2325480	We're going to reenact the Mamma Musical, or Mamma Mia Musical right here.
2325480	2327040	It'll be fun.
2327040	2328080	Alright.
2328080	2329080	Not on the air though.
2329080	2331280	The listeners have done nothing to deserve that.
2331280	2336120	Hey, more details coming out of Microsoft's camp, including that big dashboard update
2336120	2337120	that's been rumored.
2337120	2343640	There's going to be a huge dashboard update coming a little later this fall, and apparently
2343640	2346400	some of the cool stuff that they're going to be putting in this dashboard update is
2346400	2348400	Netflix integration.
2348400	2352760	If you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber and a Netflix subscriber, you can now use Netflix
2352760	2354280	on your Xbox 360.
2354280	2360720	You can stream movies from your Netflix queue to your 360, which I think is kind of cool.
2360720	2363740	The thing is though, you know, only certain movies, the ones that they allow to be streamed
2363740	2367280	on the internet will do this, not in HD, sadly.
2367280	2373560	It's going to be SD only for now, but they say when Netflix is ready to do HD, Microsoft's
2373560	2375240	ready to bring HD home.
2375240	2378420	So that's kind of interesting.
2378420	2382800	The big shock and awe, avatars, oh, we didn't see anything of that coming, but yeah.
2382800	2386360	The avatars, which are kind of like the Mii ripoffs, but of course, you know, they want
2386360	2387600	to do a little bit better.
2387600	2391280	So now not only do you have these avatars, but now you have these little like rooms that
2391280	2393320	your avatars can go in.
2393320	2396280	It's not like home, but it kind of is.
2396280	2401120	It's not even really, I mean, because it's just like this big white room, kind of like
2401120	2402440	the construct.
2402440	2407480	You can still use your gamertags pictures, like if you have an Orange Laundrio gamer
2407480	2411040	pic, because we actually have one on the marketplace, I don't know if you've seen it.
2411040	2414380	It's in community gamer pics too, but if you have like your OLR gamer pic, you can still
2414380	2418840	use it, but they are going to kind of try to get people to switch over to avatars, which
2418840	2420800	yeah.
2420800	2424280	Games will now be able to give you avatar unlocks.
2424280	2426840	But that's not too much of a surprise when you consider games as it is, can give you
2426840	2427840	gamer pics.
2427840	2429740	It's just that a lot of games choose not to do it.
2429740	2431040	Now I got a question for you.
2431040	2437000	Do you feel ripped off at all, I mean, I know you can use your like themes with, I mean,
2437000	2439840	but it's like in the background, like far background in this stuff.
2439840	2443880	It's not quite as integrated as before, but do you feel ripped off for like buying say
2443880	2448420	like themes or gamer pics off of Xbox Live and now they're going to switch it all over
2448420	2452880	to avatars, because you know they're just going to fucking sell like clothing and shit
2452880	2456120	for your avatars, and that's how they're going to make even more money off that crap.
2456120	2457120	I agree, it's all Gaia.
2457120	2460880	Eh, I haven't bought any of that stuff in a while, so I'm okay.
2460880	2464080	You know, ever since the OLR gamer pic came out, I have no use for other gamer pics, and
2464080	2468920	as far as themes go, not a lot of that stuff makes me actually want to go, ooh, I want
2468920	2472400	to spend a dollar for that, because you can get custom themes off your PC.
2472400	2474000	As long as I can still do that, I'm down.
2474000	2476240	As long as I can still do that.
2476240	2477240	That's special.
2477240	2480840	Also, I want to point out real quick before we move on, another thing that was announced
2480840	2486040	is Xbox Live Prime Time, and one specific thing that was announced is a version of One
2486040	2490360	Versus 100, and this is actually something where they're going to have like a live night
2490360	2495480	where you can be a part of this game show thing using your avatars, and supposedly you're
2495480	2499640	going to be able to win real prizes, so you could be playing in your Xbox as one of the
2499640	2502640	people in The Mob in this One Versus 100 show.
2502640	2503640	That sounds fun.
2503640	2505640	That's kind of interesting.
2505640	2508040	It's a very casual gamer friendly thing, too.
2508040	2510320	I can imagine whole families getting around to play this type of game.
2510320	2512520	You know where they used to have some sort of service like that, I'm not sure if it's
2512520	2516360	still around now, where you could do that with like TV shows and you'd actually be playing
2516360	2517960	along with the live TV show?
2517960	2519600	I don't think Game Show Network does that.
2519600	2520600	Yeah.
2520600	2521600	On their website.
2521600	2522600	Well, not necessarily through that.
2522600	2525680	This actually was like its own device or something.
2525680	2526680	You know what it reminds me of?
2526680	2528960	The old Berkeley Systems games on the PC.
2528960	2533340	Like I don't know if you guys ever played Acrophobia or, God, there was the other game
2533340	2539200	with the tower in it, and I apologize if you're hearing that noise, I don't know what's causing
2539200	2540200	that.
2540200	2541720	It must be, it sounds like a cell phone noise or something.
2541720	2542840	That's a cell phone interacting with speakers.
2542840	2544800	Okay, I don't think they got that on the show, sorry.
2544800	2547320	Whoa, hello, live radio.
2547320	2550720	But yeah, it reminds me of that, like that Berkeley Systems stuff back in the day.
2550720	2553840	I used to love those games, those game shows, they're so much fun.
2553840	2557820	So I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out on Xbox, hopefully it doesn't all
2557820	2562160	crash the first night because you know that's something that is likely to happen.
2562160	2570240	Well, in other news, more stuff for Xbox Live Arcade is a present for us from the people
2570240	2575240	who brought us Pac-Man Championship Edition, and it's called Galaga Legions.
2575240	2577640	So it's very shiny and pretty.
2577640	2585280	And it's the same sort of redesigned, you know, same type of play that, you know, starting
2585280	2589680	to stick with the style but trying to beef it up for the modern era.
2589680	2593720	So it's shiny.
2593720	2594720	That's cool.
2594720	2596680	I mean, but again, it's going to be one of those things where you start to go, why did
2596680	2599280	I buy the original Galaga when this is available now?
2599280	2604200	Well, the original Galaga came out in the 80s and you were probably five.
2604200	2605640	I know, I know, but still.
2605640	2609960	I don't know, this resembles more like Geometry Wars than Galaga.
2609960	2612200	It's definitely a lot more flashy.
2612200	2614800	It's kind of one of those things I want to get my hands on to see how it really works.
2614800	2619040	Yeah, because Pac-Man Championship Edition was only like half Pac-Man to me, you know
2619040	2620040	what I mean?
2620040	2623800	There was a whole different strategy to it than in the regular Pac-Man, even though at
2623800	2625560	first glance it looks the same.
2625560	2627840	I'm assuming Galaga will be similar, who knows?
2627840	2630160	I think it's going to follow that type of suit.
2630160	2631160	Yeah, most likely.
2631160	2632160	Cool.
2632160	2637200	Well, this week there's actually some game releases coming out, which is nice.
2637200	2641400	Not a whole lot, but you know, some okay stuff I guess.
2641400	2648520	And starting things off here on the DS, I know Rob is looking forward to this, Final
2648520	2652280	Fantasy IV making its way out.
2652280	2658160	Also on the DS this week, Azsuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns, and I know a lot of people
2658160	2660200	like that one.
2660200	2663840	On DS as well, and I played a little bit of this a few weeks ago, new international track
2663840	2666000	and field for the DS.
2666000	2673900	If you really want some frantic, I guess stylus rubbing on there, that's going to be a game
2673900	2674900	for you.
2674900	2679160	Now, also on PC, a bunch of smaller titles here.
2679160	2688520	City Life 2008 edition, Baseball Mogul 2009, Uber Soldier 2, The End of Hitler, awesome
2688520	2691520	title there.
2691520	2698480	And let's see here on the DS also, Nancy Drew, Mystery of the Clue Bender Society.
2698480	2708920	On the Wii, we've got Kid Sports Crazy Golf, another shovelware title from Destineer.
2708920	2712960	The Mummy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor on PS2, Wii, and DS.
2712960	2715880	Sadly enough, I think that's the biggest game this week.
2715880	2720560	And Order Up on the Wii, yet another Cookie Mama type game.
2720560	2729040	And finally, this I believe is on the Xbox Live Arcade and PS3, or PS Network.
2729040	2736360	We've got 1942 Joint Strike coming out on the Arcade this week.
2736360	2740800	Still sounds like a pretty busy week for releases, considering it's the week after E3, but it's
2740800	2742240	summertime too.
2742240	2744560	So I'm very excited about Final Fantasy IV.
2744560	2747540	I was looking at the website, looking at some of the trailers that have been released this
2747540	2748540	week.
2748540	2751520	You know, the game's been out in Japan for a while, but I've been surprisingly staying
2751520	2753980	away from a lot of the news that has come out about it.
2753980	2757360	And I am quite excited to check out Final Fantasy IV on the DS.
2757360	2759240	Have you seen much of it?
2759240	2760240	Not really.
2760240	2761840	God, they have voice acting in it.
2761840	2763800	And you want to know one thing I learned from the voice acting?
2763800	2767480	I always thought the main character's name was Cecil.
2767480	2769840	That's what it looks like, right, Cecil?
2769840	2775720	Cecil is apparently the name, if you listen to the voice acting.
2775720	2781080	That makes sense, because I don't think there's a C sound in Japanese.
2781080	2785080	I was just surprised a little bit, I mean, you know.
2785080	2787800	All these years, I'm thinking one thing and it turns out it's the other.
2787800	2788800	It's blowing your mind.
2788800	2791120	It's just blowing my mind, exactly.
2791120	2793480	Let's go over to Japan and check out some of the release dates that are going to be
2793480	2794480	happening over there.
2794480	2801200	In fact, the entire Asia region is getting a version of Wall-E on the Xbox 360 this week.
2801200	2805080	But over in Japan specifically, Bully Scholarship Edition finally makes its way to Japan on
2805080	2809680	July the 24th, as well as their local version of Guitar Hero 3, Legends of Rock.
2809680	2811560	It is the same song list, if you were wondering.
2811560	2813760	It is not a J-Rock song list.
2813760	2818200	If it was, I'd be importing that shit, because that would be a lot of fun, I think.
2818200	2825040	Coming out on the PlayStation 3, Kung Fu Panda, as well as the PlayStation 3 eye camera pack.
2825040	2828000	I guess that's some type of new eye bundle.
2828000	2833660	Also, Siren, isn't that like the remake of the first Siren on PlayStation 3 or something?
2833660	2835560	New translation.
2835560	2838160	It's the episodic game now.
2838160	2839160	So there you have it.
2839160	2840640	That's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
2840640	2842680	Wangen Midnight finally gets a price reduction.
2842680	2844880	Good, because that game blew ass.
2844880	2847880	Fucking A, I wish I hadn't bought it.
2847880	2850400	Coming out on the Nintendo Wii, it's a pretty busy week over there.
2850400	2856760	Kung Fu Panda, Mesaze Sori Master, Sakai ni Challenge Hen, comes out, as well as Samurai
2856760	2863440	Spirits, Rokuban Shobu, and Speed Racer the video game, as well as Wario Land Shake, all
2863440	2865240	come out on the Nintendo Wii this week.
2865240	2868120	Samurai Spirits is Samurai Shodown.
2868120	2874800	Yeah, some type of compilation package, it looks like.
2874800	2875800	That's cool.
2875800	2879240	Yeah, it's their version of Samurai Shodown Anthology.
2879240	2880240	So that's pretty cool.
2880240	2884240	Although, I'm surprised they wouldn't just do that for Virtual Console, because they're
2884240	2887760	releasing Neo Geo games on Virtual Console now, and I guess if there are people that
2887760	2888760	will buy it, they will release it.
2888760	2892480	Especially if it's got all the way up through 5 and maybe the 64 versions, even though they
2892480	2893480	were shitty.
2893480	2894480	Gotcha.
2894480	2900040	A couple price reductions on PlayStation 2, including Biohazard 4, Resident Evil, Busou
2900040	2905000	Orenken, Burnout Dominator, as well, but coming out new on the PlayStation 2 this week, their
2905000	2911400	own version of Bully's Scholarship Edition, as well as the Samurai Spirits Anthology collection
2911400	2912800	comes out in Japan this week as well.
2912800	2918000	Moving to the handhelds, the DS, you can get some new little sticky film things for your
2918000	2919000	DS.
2919000	2922200	All for the Peanuts gang, hooray, because I guess the Peanuts are actually still really
2922200	2924280	big in Japan, if I'm not mistaken.
2924280	2925280	Yes.
2925280	2929920	Speed Racer comes out on the DS as well, Twilight Syndrome, as well as SimCity DS gets
2929920	2931640	a price reduction.
2931640	2934920	Kung Fu Panda gets another release over there on the DS.
2934920	2941640	And Kirarin Revolution, Mina Di Odoro, Furi Furi Debut comes out from Konami.
2941640	2946560	I'm thinking it says Revolution in the title, so first you think it might be a music game,
2946560	2952020	but no, it's some other type of little action game that looks cutesy.
2952020	2953800	You'll know a lot else about that game, sorry.
2953800	2958880	Checking out the PSP real quick, and then we'll call it a wrap for Japanese dates this
2958880	2959880	week.
2959880	2965760	On the PSP you get Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, a price reduction, Guilty Gear
2965760	2972840	Accent Core Plus, and, too bad there isn't a plushie, Infinite Loop comes out as well.
2972840	2975880	Accent Core Plush would be funny, it's all stuffed animals fighting.
2975880	2977360	Fighting each other, that'd be awesome.
2977360	2980200	That's it for your Japanese release dates.
2980200	2985200	In the UK, just a few things, on the 22nd, Yuzuna 2, The Unemployed Ninja Returns on
2985200	2991160	DS, on the 23rd, 1942 Joint Strike on Xbox 360, the same one to be out the next day on
2991160	2999360	PlayStation 3, 25th, Buzzmaster Quiz, Race Driver Grid on DS, Romance of the Three Kingdoms
2999360	3001600	9, I'm sorry, 11, shit.
3001600	3004560	God, I remember the first one.
3004560	3008400	Super Swing Golf on Wii.
3008400	3010840	Romance of the Three Kingdoms 9 is on PC.
3010840	3011840	Wow.
3011840	3012840	Cool.
3012840	3013840	Alright.
3013840	3022080	Well, the next big conference that we had up during E3 was, of course, Nintendo, and
3022080	3027120	one announcement that they made was that they're gonna be branching out from their normal games
3027120	3030160	and bring us a sequel to Wii Sports.
3030160	3031360	Awesome.
3031360	3036520	Wii Sports Resort will be coming to the Wii, and it will be bundled with a brand new accessory
3036520	3041680	that's called the Wii Motion Plus, and what the Wii Motion Plus will do for your Wii Remote
3041680	3050120	is allow you to actually have one-one motion-sensitive capturing, so be able to detect the finite
3050120	3055200	movements of your wrist and arm and et cetera, stuff that probably should have been included
3055200	3058880	in the remote in the first place, but oh, we couldn't fit it in there before.
3058880	3062000	But since it's a Wii Sports game, everybody will buy it, so we'll be okay.
3062000	3066960	It will be coming with one of those, and all the other ones will cost you extra money.
3066960	3071080	I wanna see- no, I haven't heard what the price of those were.
3071080	3072080	Something was $29.99.
3072080	3074240	Hopefully it wasn't the Wii Motion Plus things.
3074240	3076880	I'm curious how many games in the future will require this.
3076880	3078240	Probably a lot.
3078240	3085100	And what's included so far, what they've announced in Wii Sports Resort is there's Disc Dog, which
3085100	3089920	is like a frisbee game that you play with a little dog, as seen in-
3089920	3090920	Aww, that's cute.
3090920	3093280	What was it, uh, Wii Fit?
3093280	3100520	There is a, um, a jetski racing game, which I forget if they actually call it, um, looks
3100520	3106760	kind of like, um, I guess, I don't know, a jetski racing game.
3106760	3107760	It's kinda cool.
3107760	3109600	Wave Race 64, maybe.
3109600	3113640	And finally they had sword fighting in there as well, which people-
3113640	3114640	Cool!
3114640	3118160	But they made the swords look like lightsabers, sort of, so, you know, people-
3118160	3119160	Oh my god, lightsabers!
3119160	3120160	I gotta buy this!
3120160	3121160	I gotta buy this!
3121160	3122680	Everyone the Star Wars game they wanted.
3122680	3126320	Except it's not really lightsabers, it's just, you know, poles.
3126320	3127320	Big pole nerfsabers.
3127320	3130480	Yeah, poles that look like, uh, happen to look like lightsabers.
3130480	3131480	They said that there's-
3131480	3132480	Nerfsabers sounds fun.
3132480	3136760	There may be, um, up to ten games in this pack whenever it's released.
3136760	3142780	It's not supposed to be out there until spring of next year, so, um, got some time for that.
3142780	3146480	You know what's funny though, out of all the E3 predictions out there, I would think that
3146480	3151000	a sequel to Wii Sports getting announced would be, like, a so frickin' obvious thing.
3151000	3152480	I didn't see a lot of people predict that.
3152480	3153480	Well-
3153480	3155740	It's not one of those things when they announced it, I was like, oh, of course.
3155740	3156740	Of course!
3156740	3160600	Well, here's the thing, here's my thing, is, it makes sense for them business-wise, because
3160600	3164320	you have a problem where people are picking up the Wii and all they're playing is Wii
3164320	3165320	Sports.
3165320	3170120	So, if they want to sell games to this market that's not really buying games, well, their
3170120	3174280	best bet would be to put a sequel out for Wii Sports.
3174280	3178640	I don't know, it's definitely going to be selling very well.
3178640	3181720	I don't know if they're going to convince everybody that bought, you know, the Wii Sports.
3181720	3184640	It would sell better if they get that crap out by Christmas.
3184640	3185640	Yeah, it-
3185640	3187480	I'm kind of surprised it's not.
3187480	3189360	Well, I don't know.
3189360	3191280	Um, it'll be interesting, I guess.
3191280	3193800	I'll have to check it out when it actually comes out.
3193800	3199360	Alright, another big game that Nintendo was triumphing at their press conference was Wii
3199360	3200360	Music.
3200360	3203720	Wii Music is that kind of that game you've seen a little bit in development slowly but
3203720	3204720	surely over the years.
3204720	3208720	Like, I think it started as that orchestra demo you saw at the first E3 where they showed
3208720	3209720	Wii.
3209720	3210720	And that game is special to me already.
3210720	3211720	Years ago?
3211720	3212720	Why is that?
3212720	3213720	Because that's when I met Koji Kondo.
3213720	3214720	Oh, okay.
3214720	3217920	That's- I'm glad, Lisa, there's something special for you.
3217920	3222040	I got to tell him that he was the one that inspired me to start off as a music major.
3222040	3223040	Oh, nice.
3223040	3225320	Even though I didn't change- even though I changed my major later.
3225320	3226320	That's alright.
3226320	3227320	He didn't need to know that part.
3227320	3231400	Uh, but also, you know, you see- and you saw a little bit of this, I think, at the years-
3231400	3232400	years future on.
3232400	3235600	Well, apparently, 50 instruments are going to be included in this.
3235600	3237120	You use the remote, you use the nunchuck.
3237120	3242000	You can also tap your foot on the balance board to kind of simulate a drum set.
3242000	3246280	Uh, apparently, you're going to have violin, guitar, marimba.
3246280	3249120	I'm hoping there's a sitar in this but nothing's been said about that yet.
3249120	3250120	That one is zither.
3250120	3251120	Um.
3251120	3252120	Or an autoharp.
3252120	3253360	Here's what Miyamoto has said about this game.
3253360	3257160	Wii Music is a slightly different play experience than you've seen with other music games.
3257160	3260640	Now most music games require you to press buttons with precise timing to symbols on
3260640	3261640	the screen.
3261640	3265720	So we've designed Wii Music to allow everyone, including those who can't read music, to enjoy
3265720	3267880	the experience of playing music.
3267880	3272240	Now the interesting thing about this, like, from what I've been hearing from E3 attendees,
3272240	3274120	is that this game is shit.
3274120	3279280	Which is kind of sad, in a way, because it's kind of like a good concept, but it does sound
3279280	3280960	like they took the game out of the game.
3280960	3281960	Yeah.
3281960	3283680	And now you have a noise-making device.
3283680	3284680	Well here's the thing.
3284680	3285680	That's basically what it's turned into.
3285680	3286680	Here's the thing.
3286680	3290960	Miyamoto came up on- on stage and said, who would have thought that we would have sold,
3290960	3294960	you know, millions of bathroom scales, and laughed at it.
3294960	3295960	You know?
3295960	3299640	And he laughed at it because, like, you smug asshole.
3299640	3303640	And I don't really, you know, I'm not seeing that he's laughing at, you know, the people
3303640	3308840	that are buying this stuff, but in a way, you can kind of look at it like this is absolutely
3308840	3311480	ridiculous that people are buying this shit.
3311480	3313120	Wii Music, okay, let me put it this way.
3313120	3318600	If you walk down your average toy aisle at any major retail store out there, you will
3318600	3324360	find these stupid instruments that you can literally pick up and tap a button, one single
3324360	3326260	button, and it will play a song.
3326260	3328960	You can tap it fast, you can tap it slow.
3328960	3331320	This is exactly what you'll be buying with this game.
3331320	3335200	There's absolutely no way to play the song wrong because all you're doing is tapping
3335200	3336720	buttons and pretending.
3336720	3337720	You know what's funny though?
3337720	3339200	I still think this game is going to be huge.
3339200	3341560	I think there- I think there is an audience for this game.
3341560	3342640	Yes, there is an audience.
3342640	3346860	It's the casual market that will buy these shitty Destiny-er games that come out because
3346860	3350400	they look cool and they'll drop, you know, 20 bucks on them and the games are absolute
3350400	3351400	shit.
3351400	3356360	Miyamoto is a genius because, you know, us hardcore gamers, at least, you know, I'm
3356360	3358520	looking at this going, where's the game?
3358520	3359520	Where's the game?
3359520	3360520	And they're going to sell millions.
3360520	3361520	Well, great.
3361520	3364640	You know, I'm glad that they're going to sell millions of this because, you know,
3364640	3371100	they would sell millions of a good game as well and, you know, their loyal fans who buy
3371100	3375400	all these games that come out each time are kind of disappointed.
3375400	3380720	I know, I was like, after watching the whole press conference from Nintendo, I'm like,
3380720	3381720	that was it?
3381720	3382920	That was a fucking waste of time.
3382920	3386960	I have to ask Jamie because she did say, you know, she was favorable to the orchestra thing
3386960	3391060	when she saw it, but hearing that they've kind of taken the game out and now you've
3391060	3394320	got a music simulation device, is this still interesting to you?
3394320	3395600	Yes, very much so.
3395600	3399320	I'm sorry, I was a music major, I was in band.
3399320	3404340	I would love to get other people together who are likewise musically inclined and see
3404340	3405340	what we can do.
3405340	3408680	I mean, I loved a lot of the MIDI Sims that did that.
3408680	3411880	I worry, though, that this game isn't going to have that kind of depth.
3411880	3414200	Like I would think, especially if you're going to get a bunch of music nerds together
3414200	3417680	to do it, I would think that the game would need more depth and I worry that this game
3417680	3418680	is not going to have it.
3418680	3421600	I mean, prove me wrong, Nintendo, please do, but that would be my concern.
3421600	3423840	They said that there's no way to play this wrong.
3423840	3428680	I mean, literally all you're doing is tapping a button and it plays a song.
3428680	3431840	It's just like a one button song, like you have the keyboard, so play the one button
3431840	3435800	song where you can tap the key and it will just kind of play a little MIDI thing.
3435800	3439560	We actually watched, I remember when we were watching them actually play this during the
3439560	3441280	whole thing, it was hard to watch.
3441280	3444520	They butchered the Super Mario theme on there.
3444520	3446260	It was crap.
3446260	3447840	It looked horrible.
3447840	3450540	I would not be touching this game at all.
3450540	3452480	It doesn't look fun, but you know what?
3452480	3456240	Little kids and stuff that want to play music and stuff like that, it might get them interested
3456240	3460240	in music, but it's going to be one of those things, just like Wii Fit, unfortunately,
3460240	3464480	for a lot of people where you pick it up, you buy it, and then all of a sudden, wow,
3464480	3468160	I'm not playing it anymore, and they've already got your purchase, and they've already made
3468160	3471780	their money, and now they're going to be hawking you the next piece of shit thing that they're
3471780	3475520	going to throw out there for the casual market.
3475520	3476520	You know what?
3476520	3479120	You did hit on something good, though, is that if it gets more kids interested in music,
3479120	3482840	then it's a good thing, because I was a band geek in school.
3482840	3488760	I would think that they would add in some sort of difficulty or control level, you know,
3488760	3492720	add a little bit more freedom in what you're allowed to express with it.
3492720	3495100	That was what my thought was.
3495100	3498040	If there's a didgeridoo in the game, I'm sold, though.
3498040	3500440	I take back everything I said to play the didgeridoo.
3500440	3505160	Well, let's just, when we see a little bit more, and maybe we're lucky, and they'll be
3505160	3511200	showing this off at PAX, and we'll actually get to play it, but my expectations of this
3511200	3516880	game weren't that high to begin with, because it seems like they keep forcing this stuff
3516880	3517880	down our throats.
3517880	3520160	They were showing this off before the Wii ever came out.
3520160	3523800	They showed this off last year at E3, when Miyamoto came on stage.
3523800	3528080	Everyone's anticipating this game coming out, and every time I saw it, I was just like,
3528080	3529560	I don't really give a crap about this.
3529560	3531080	This looks stupid.
3531080	3535960	And sure enough, they come out on stage during the press conference now, and yeah, it was
3535960	3536960	stupid.
3536960	3540400	Thank you for totally fulfilling my expectations on this piece of product.
3540400	3544340	The other thing about having the one-button control is, if I'm right, you are the conductor
3544340	3545920	also, right?
3545920	3549260	I think they have a conductor mini-game in there.
3549260	3553080	As a conductor, though, if I can understand having the one-button melody part playing
3553080	3557300	as being conductor, because it is the conductor's job to signal when the next part comes in
3557300	3558880	by following along with the music.
3558880	3564160	So, you know, by reading the score, you have to signal to make sure that, first of all,
3564160	3567120	even though the band is supposed to be keeping up with what's going on, they're supposed
3567120	3571080	to know what you're doing, you still have to signal them, you still control volume,
3571080	3573000	you know, keep the time.
3573000	3574000	They're going to follow you.
3574000	3576520	I would expect that that would make sense for a controller mode.
3576520	3579280	I just worry it's not going to have that kind of depth.
3579280	3582760	I think it's just going to be, hey, kid, waggle the thing in the air, you're a conductor,
3582760	3583760	wee!
3583760	3587680	I think they should have difficulty settings to allow for a broader market to play it.
3587680	3590280	But there's nothing, there's no on-screen cues, there's nothing.
3590280	3594040	It's literally, there's a little drum beat going along and you decide whether you want
3594040	3597800	to tap your thing with the song or whatever.
3597800	3601840	What they should have done, and this could have opened it up for the entire market instead
3601840	3603080	of just, see, that's the problem.
3603080	3606720	They can't just develop for everybody, they just want to either develop for the casual
3606720	3608160	market or the hardcore market.
3608160	3611880	They can't see past developing something that would appeal to both.
3611880	3616880	And what they should have done is added something like Mario Paint where you could orchestrate
3616880	3621720	your own music, you know, make it where you can have four different tracks or eight different
3621720	3625960	tracks that you can record on using different instruments, and you can play different notes
3625960	3631000	depending on how you had it angled and that kind of stuff, and do it that way.
3631000	3634440	And then if you don't, if you're not interested in that, that's too complex for you.
3634440	3637240	You can sit there and tap your finger to the music or whatever.
3637240	3640120	Well, we need to move on, but I will still close with this.
3640120	3644880	I don't care if the game is a piece of flaming poo, if it gets five-year-olds saying, hey,
3644880	3648760	I want to play a real marimba someday or I want to play a real, you know, saxophone,
3648760	3651200	French horn, whatever, then it's a good thing.
3651200	3652200	So we'll see.
3652200	3655800	I like that you said saxophone and French horn together because they have very complementary
3655800	3656800	tones.
3656800	3660600	I pulled instruments out of my ass that I remember from marching band.
3660600	3663320	You know what game, though, I think they should make that would be a good music game?
3663320	3664320	What's that?
3664320	3666320	You know what a theremin is?
3666320	3667320	No.
3667320	3671960	It uses analog wave signals to play music, like it's got one that goes out vertically
3671960	3676480	and one that goes up horizontally, and you use your hands in between the waves.
3676480	3679720	Oh, okay, I've seen that, yes.
3679720	3681920	You control the music that you play.
3681920	3687280	One of them is your volume and the other one is your pitch, and you can wiggle your fingers
3687280	3690940	a certain way and it'll do staccato or, you know, do it slowly.
3690940	3695240	It'll be more flowing, but they should do a game that mimics a theremin.
3695240	3697040	Wouldn't that be cool?
3697040	3701000	I got to get some comments from chat because, you know, they're commenting on it.
3701000	3704260	GS68 says, I want Wii cowbell.
3704260	3706440	They have the cowbell in there.
3706440	3707440	I'm serious.
3707440	3708440	I'm getting it.
3708440	3709440	It has a cowbell.
3709440	3714080	Peeger Junior 92, or PK, I'm sorry, I always get the two names, PK Junior 92 says, Rob,
3714080	3718000	how would you play a didgerid thing with a Wii, because he can't spell it, a didgerid
3718000	3719160	do with a Wiimote?
3719160	3720160	I don't know.
3720160	3721520	How are you going to play all this other shit with a Wiimote?
3721520	3722520	They'll make it work.
3722520	3723600	It's Nintendo.
3723600	3725680	They create miracles every day.
3725680	3728560	Frisbee says, but those kids aren't going to do that, Rob.
3728560	3729640	I bet you're wrong.
3729640	3732640	They say more people are taking guitar lessons because of Guitar Hero, trying to learn how
3732640	3734060	to play the real thing.
3734060	3737440	I know what you're thinking, Debbie Downer, but I bet you're going to be wrong.
3737440	3738440	I hope you're wrong.
3738440	3743080	Not to be all pessimistic or anything, but seriously, if you're really excited about
3743080	3749120	Wii Music and you haven't watched the conference yet, I urge you to at least watch that portion
3749120	3752840	of the Nintendo Press Conference, because you will be disappointed.
3752840	3755920	I mean, it literally, it's just like, ouch.
3755920	3759800	Alright, let's, new game, new Nintendo game, please.
3759800	3760800	Stuff.
3760800	3765680	The game called, um, Nintendo Does Shit is coming out, and no, I'm kidding.
3765680	3768760	And Nintendo Does Shit all over your wallet, it's amazing.
3768760	3771200	No, it prints money.
3771200	3777120	This is, though, the happy news, I think, of E3 for a lot of Nintendo fans, is Animal
3777120	3781360	Crossing City Folk, which will be, um, I mean, basically it's the same sort of graphical
3781360	3787880	style that we know way back in the Nintendo 64 era of Doublesu no Mori, you know, because
3787880	3790640	that was the first version that came out, was on Nintendo 64.
3790640	3793720	In other words, they added widescreen and that's it.
3793720	3795560	Pretty much.
3795560	3801400	But, um, the neat thing about this one is that you can use your Wii message board, um,
3801400	3806360	to send messages to your friends, and you can put on masks that look like you're me.
3806360	3807360	That'd be cool.
3807360	3812880	Um, especially if whoever gets goats say me.
3812880	3818580	There is also a microphone option that's called Wii Speak, so you can talk to other players
3818580	3826120	around the world, and it's just pretty cool.
3826120	3828160	I don't know what to think about this.
3828160	3829160	I'm excited.
3829160	3830160	I'm gonna buy it.
3830160	3831160	I'm getting it.
3831160	3832160	Granted, I'm getting it.
3832160	3834440	I have to be able to send nasty messages to villagers everywhere.
3834440	3838080	I hope it's one of the things where it works a little better in theory, because the problem
3838080	3843040	with Animal Crossing DS, the problem with that is that there's no island.
3843040	3844240	Well, not just that.
3844240	3848000	You had to coordinate with people in order to be able to visit their village, which granted
3848000	3851920	was a step up from the GameCube one where they had to actually be at your house.
3851920	3856360	But I think that's kind of why the DS one lost its charm, is they really didn't add
3856360	3860680	that much from the GameCube one, and you kind of had to do all this coordination.
3860680	3865440	I am hoping in this one that it uses that Wii Connect 24 for a good thing where I can
3865440	3869480	go to people's villages in the middle of the night and steal their fruit.
3869480	3876520	Plus, I'm hearing they took the whole, like, you know how there was like a game in it?
3876520	3880720	Is it the game, in a sense, is to pay back Tom Nook for your house, right?
3880720	3884840	I'm hearing they took that out, that there is no game now in Animal Crossing.
3884840	3886160	It's just do stuff.
3886160	3890880	No, no, no, they can't take that out, but I'm thinking since it says city folk, maybe
3890880	3894880	it's going to be a much broader place.
3894880	3895880	I hope.
3895880	3900520	Well, they say that you now can travel to a city, like a New York City style place where
3900520	3903120	you can get your hair done and there's all this other stuff.
3903120	3904960	So you live in the suburbs?
3904960	3905960	I guess.
3905960	3908240	You live in a, you know, well, it's all by train, right?
3908240	3912560	So you live in a train's away town and you can go to the big city and get all this other
3912560	3913560	stuff.
3913560	3915760	That is sort of very Japanese, isn't it?
3915760	3916760	In a way.
3916760	3921400	It's also kind of lame, though, I mean, and I hate to put the pessimistic spin on everything,
3921400	3923640	but here's what they basically did with the city portion.
3923640	3927320	The city portion, remember how there was little events that would happen at specific times
3927320	3931240	during the week where you would have, I forget the bitch's name, they'd come and try to sell
3931240	3932240	you the expensive...
3932240	3933240	Sahara?
3933240	3935820	Yeah, Sahara, that she would sell you the expensive clothing.
3935820	3936820	They had the guy…
3936820	3937840	Oh, she sold the carpets.
3937840	3941400	The carpets, okay, they had the other people that sell the expensive clothing, they had
3941400	3944960	the people that would sell the rare like furniture and stuff like that.
3944960	3948680	Well, guess what, now you don't have to worry about going to your town specific days, you
3948680	3951240	just go to the city and it's all there.
3951240	3952720	I mean, what's the point?
3952720	3956600	I mean, the whole point is you go back to your town and actually be able to play it
3956600	3957600	and stuff.
3957600	3959620	I think you're still going to have events that are specific to your town.
3959620	3960780	There has to be, they're just going to expand on it.
3960780	3962480	There's gotta be new things.
3962480	3967840	What I think is they're going to, this is my vision, this is what I would do, is that
3967840	3973080	they would take those features that you may not, you know, that we've all gotten used
3973080	3976840	to, that we know on this day X person's going to be there, give them their boutiques in
3976840	3982080	the city, but have special festivals, have a carnival maybe, something that happens in
3982080	3986800	your town, that have very limited objects that you can maybe get like once a month or
3986800	3987800	something.
3987800	3990960	You know, and it's, this wouldn't be a big surprise for me, but I honestly don't think
3990960	3998280	there's going to be, there will be hardly any innovation from the GameCube version,
3998280	4001040	let alone the DS version with this version.
4001040	4004600	They're literally pumping out the same fucking game on every system so far.
4004600	4009160	I did get the impression this game's kind of already in the can, that this game's just
4009160	4010400	waiting to be released already.
4010400	4015800	And you know, it's not a bad, I mean the game's good, it's fun, and you'll play it for a while,
4015800	4020680	and then you'll get bored of it like all the other ones, but it's like they're not even
4020680	4021680	trying.
4021680	4025360	It's like, okay, we put out the same game again, people will buy it, let's release it.
4025360	4028400	I would like to see more things that you have to accomplish with other people.
4028400	4032480	I think that would be great, like you have to do, like in order to get super rare things,
4032480	4035920	you have to work with somebody else, I mean, because it would give this whole WeSpeak thing
4035920	4039080	a use, because right now this thing is screaming gimmick.
4039080	4041080	Maybe you have a job.
4041080	4043240	Like besides just working for Tom Nook?
4043240	4045360	Yeah, maybe like you can be a baker.
4045360	4046800	There's so much more they could do with this.
4046800	4050360	Look at Broken Blast Works, okay, you can make custom ships in that game.
4050360	4052720	You can make custom levels, custom everything.
4052720	4054960	Why can't you make like custom furniture?
4054960	4059700	Have like a very basic building thing where you can like make simple geometric shapes
4059700	4061000	and put patterns on them.
4061000	4062460	I mean, why can't you do that?
4062460	4063960	Gotta read comments from chat.
4063960	4067360	Game Guru says a carnival was confirmed for City Folk.
4067360	4068400	So that's kind of cool.
4068400	4071160	Frisbee says there better be a freak show in the carnival.
4071160	4072760	That would be awesome.
4072760	4077040	I want to have the bearded lady move to my village.
4077040	4082080	I want more than four characters in my village, which would be nice.
4082080	4085360	I also want like say when you're not playing your characters that they walk around and
4085360	4086840	do stuff, which would be also cool.
4086840	4090640	I also want to be able to put the Mii masks on the other villagers that are in there in
4090640	4092560	case I don't like their ugly face.
4092560	4096360	Joshi16 says Animal Crossing is the new Harvest Moon.
4096360	4097360	I don't know.
4097360	4101360	If you have some comments you want to have read on air, chat.orangesontrader.com when
4101360	4105960	we chat live on these Sunday nights at 6 o'clock pacific time at allgames.com.
4105960	4113280	Well, something that the only thing during the Nintendo press conference that had me
4113280	4117840	excited that this conference actually might turn around was the brief announcement that
4117840	4122480	Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars was coming to the DS.
4122480	4126160	And that is exactly all we know about it, other than it will take place during Liberty
4126160	4131520	City and yeah, it's being worked on.
4131520	4137480	No word other than that what exactly this is, but I'm excited because it's Grand Theft
4137480	4138680	Auto.
4138680	4144320	And then immediately the conference turned around and went back to shit again.
4144320	4146760	Did they show any screens or anything from this game?
4146760	4148440	Nope, they just showed the logo and that was it.
4148440	4151640	If I were to guess, I'd say it's either, I think it's going to be like a top down game
4151640	4155640	just like the original Grand Theft Auto game, but it's going to be more massive.
4155640	4159360	I mean, if they do 3D, they might be able to pull it off.
4159360	4163520	I mean, they've pulled it off on the PSP, but I thought the PSP is a lot more powerful
4163520	4164520	than the DS.
4164520	4165520	We'll see.
4165520	4166520	I don't know.
4166520	4167520	All right.
4167520	4168520	Well, moving from Nintendo to Sony.
4168520	4173160	Sony had the last press conference of E3 this year and they announced some changes coming
4173160	4174960	to the PlayStation Network.
4174960	4179840	The video delivery service is finally hitting the PlayStation Network and the cool thing
4179840	4184080	about it though versus the Xbox 360 is that you can actually get your movies on a PlayStation
4184080	4186960	3 and then move it over to the PSP.
4186960	4191360	You can actually play the thing on both devices at the same time if you want.
4191360	4195640	So it's kind of interesting that if you buy it on one place, you can get the portable
4195640	4197080	version as well.
4197080	4201880	That's kind of cool and a feature that the other, since Microsoft doesn't have the handheld
4201880	4206880	marketplace so well and Nintendo doesn't have an internet service they could do this with,
4206880	4208480	that's kind of neat.
4208480	4213680	The rumored prices right now, $2.99 for a standard definition rental, $6 for a high
4213680	4221000	definition download, $14.99 if you want to actually purchase the movie, no idea yet about
4221000	4222560	high definition pricing.
4222560	4226400	Apparently the store went up right after the conference and you can get such movies as
4226400	4231440	Rambo, Cloverfield, The Bank Job, all right there.
4231440	4232440	That's cool.
4232440	4233440	They needed that.
4233440	4234440	But here's a tip.
4234440	4235440	Don't get Cloverfield on HD.
4235440	4236960	There's no point.
4236960	4239280	They don't sell the movies in HD yet.
4239280	4240280	Oh, okay.
4240280	4241280	Not yet.
4241280	4242280	But soon.
4242280	4246760	Soon is the all encompassing word for us, isn't it?
4246760	4255000	Well, and then something else regarding the Wii and what Nintendo's got released is the
4255000	4262920	Wii Speak microphone, which they brought up the Wii Speak with Animal Crossing, but it's
4262920	4269280	called a community microphone and it's supposed to sit on top of your infrared bar on top
4269280	4275400	of the TV and bring up basically everything in the room from what I understand.
4275400	4276400	Hooray.
4276400	4280840	So now everybody in my house can hear the obscenities people are shouting at me on the
4280840	4281840	internet.
4281840	4284000	Well, it's like a conference phone type of thing.
4284000	4285000	We'll see.
4285000	4286000	We'll see.
4286000	4287920	It's an interesting departure from the traditional headset thing.
4287920	4288920	I'll give them that.
4288920	4289920	I do like that though.
4289920	4290920	But I don't know.
4290920	4293120	I hate wearing headsets.
4293120	4295060	It's not the device that I'm worried about.
4295060	4296800	It's the implementation of it.
4296800	4297800	That's the thing.
4297800	4298800	If that makes sense.
4298800	4301120	At least it's not a camera.
4301120	4302120	I'll give you that.
4302120	4303120	I'll give you that.
4303120	4305720	I don't want a camera on my Wii.
4305720	4316080	Well also though, some other interesting news was that, especially regarding Sony, is that
4316080	4323360	they have released information saying that there will be a $399 80 gig PS3 available
4323360	4330280	in September, and labeled as the 80 gigabyte core pack.
4330280	4337720	That actually sounds kind of neat, but it's definitely the price drop from the $499 bundle
4337720	4342720	that currently has the 80 gigabyte system.
4342720	4345360	But it's not really a price drop because what they're doing is getting-
4345360	4346360	It doesn't have Metal Gear.
4346360	4348120	Well, it doesn't have Metal Gear.
4348120	4352840	And they also basically are getting rid of the 40 gig system.
4352840	4356200	Kind of think of it like the PSP, because the PSP, they have the core systems, and then
4356200	4360960	they have these entertainment bundles that they put out a fucking ton of.
4360960	4363200	And the PS3 is getting the same thing.
4363200	4366840	You're going to have the $399 core system, the 80 gig, which by the way does not play
4366840	4368240	any PlayStation 2 games at all.
4368240	4370600	It has the same backwards compatibility as the 40 gig system.
4370600	4372520	That's what I was about to say, actually.
4372520	4373520	Sorry.
4373520	4378200	You jumped in on what I was saying.
4378200	4383960	But hey, 40 gig system with a larger hard drive, so that's awesome.
4383960	4387960	I guess, though, having the 80 gig, if you're going to announce this movie thing, I mean,
4387960	4390680	I guess that's what you're going to need the space for, right?
4390680	4393480	If you're going to download all these movies, then they want you to have the bigger hard
4393480	4394480	drive, right?
4394480	4398360	So in the end, they win, right?
4398360	4402880	It makes it a lot more simplified, because if they just leave it at the 80 gig system,
4402880	4405920	you can just do, okay, the PS3 system is $399.
4405920	4410640	If you want this bundle, it's $499.
4410640	4415160	But it kind of devalues the bundle a bit, I don't know.
4415160	4420400	But something you may want to purchase for your 80 gig PS3 core system will be God of
4420400	4426880	War 3, which unsurprisingly was announced at Sony's press conference, and they showed
4426880	4433640	off a little full motion video teaser trailer, and yeah, it's God of War.
4433640	4435680	Was there any actual gameplay footage?
4435680	4442240	Not one, but it's all CGI, and it's expected sometime after this holiday season, which
4442240	4446080	could be any time.
4446080	4450200	Maybe this spring at the earliest, maybe never at the latest.
4450200	4455040	Alright, well, not only did Sony- Actually, I would probably go with the latest,
4455040	4458200	because they always seem to delay their releases of stuff.
4458200	4462820	Well, not only did Sony announce the obvious, which I would say is God of War 3, but they
4462820	4465840	announced something a little bit unexpected, I think.
4465840	4471480	It has to do with what's a new type of game they're calling a MAG, a Massive Action Game.
4471480	4474720	You know how an MMO is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game?
4474720	4478320	Well, this was supposed to be like that, but with an action game.
4478320	4484640	Apparently 256 players- Are there that many people playing online with the PS3 right now?
4484640	4485640	Probably.
4485640	4489880	The 256 players can actually all play this game at once.
4489880	4493560	It's just apparently this giant free-for-all type game.
4493560	4496240	You can get live statistics actually as you're playing.
4496240	4500580	It does look like a war kind of game, and seeing as it is being developed by the folks
4500580	4502800	who make SOCOM, it does make sense.
4502800	4505520	It's eight-player squads, is what you're in.
4505520	4507520	It's kind of interesting.
4507520	4508520	Kind of interesting.
4508520	4513480	It's kind of an expansion, I guess, on the 64-player multiplayer for Resistance 2, where
4513480	4515280	you're in squads on that as well.
4515280	4518720	I guess, though, it does kind of- You know, I said a long time ago on this show, and I'm
4518720	4523640	sure other people have too, you know, we have these massively multiplayer role-playing games.
4523640	4525920	Where's our massively multiplayer other types of games?
4525920	4526920	And here you go.
4526920	4532560	Well, they had Huxley that was supposed to be coming out at some point, but still hasn't.
4532560	4533960	But I don't know.
4533960	4537640	I mean, see, that's good, though, that they announced something like that, because that's
4537640	4539680	something that Microsoft doesn't have.
4539680	4542680	That's something that can differentiate themselves.
4542680	4544740	But I don't know.
4544740	4548920	And home is still coming, and it supposedly looks a little bit better, from what I saw
4548920	4549920	at the press conference thing.
4549920	4550920	All right.
4550920	4556000	Well, Loki's going to sum up some other E3 highlights for us, but first, I just kind
4556000	4561120	of want to go around and get everybody's highlights and lowlights from the press conferences.
4561120	4566040	Best announcement you heard, and worst announcement you heard, Loki?
4566040	4569320	The worst announcement I heard was the entire lineup from Nintendo.
4569320	4573440	Seriously, that press conference was hard to watch.
4573440	4576200	When I was done watching it, it was like, I want my 90 minutes back.
4576200	4579240	Absolutely horrible.
4579240	4581840	The best announcement?
4581840	4582840	I don't really know.
4582840	4584840	I mean, I was kind of excited about the...
4584840	4588440	There will be something that will be mentioned in the last minute stories that I think is
4588440	4593400	the most exciting announcement of everything.
4593400	4595080	Nothing really excited me.
4595080	4596080	Nothing really...
4596080	4602200	I'm very indifferent towards all of it, just because it was all stuff I expected anyway.
4602200	4608480	The least exciting thing for me is that little motion extra device thing on the Wii, because
4608480	4611840	it's just now another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy, because other games are going
4611840	4616240	to have to implement this, because it probably should have been in there in the first place.
4616240	4620740	Most exciting thing?
4620740	4621740	It's hard to say.
4621740	4625920	As excited as I am about Final Fantasy 13 and the whole fact that I've saved money on
4625920	4629400	a PlayStation 3 with that, I think I'm going to have to get a PS3 eventually.
4629400	4636820	So I would actually say I think the live prime time thing is one of the most...
4636820	4638640	Because it really was kind of a surprise.
4638640	4643880	A genuine surprise, and something that sounds pretty exciting and different, and reminds
4643880	4646040	me of the whole Berkeley systems days.
4646040	4648960	So I'm going to say that's the most exciting thing I heard in those press conferences.
4648960	4653120	Loki, any other things from the big three we might have missed?
4653120	4654120	Okay.
4654120	4657420	Starting off here, there was some Xbox Live Arcade announcements.
4657420	4659920	Quite a few of them, actually.
4659920	4661320	Some surprising stuff, too.
4661320	4666920	They were of course showing off Banjo-Kazooie 3 Nuts and Bolts, while another announcement
4666920	4671000	that they made along with that is that the original Banjo-Kazooie will be coming to Xbox
4671000	4673560	Live Arcade later this year.
4673560	4677820	Which is surprising, because that was an Nintendo 64 game.
4677820	4681560	There was also something else that they showed off that was kind of cheesy and stupid, but
4681560	4689480	you're in the movies, which is an Xbox game that uses the vision camera, and will be bundled
4689480	4692240	with the vision camera when they sell it.
4692240	4697040	It is a game that they have you doing stupid little mini games in there, and based on the
4697040	4701760	movements that you do in those mini games, it will make a B movie for you, starring yourself
4701760	4703280	and your friends.
4703280	4705520	And you can actually edit your own stuff together if you want.
4705520	4711200	It sounds like a pretty fun party game, but very cheesy.
4711200	4719720	Now as I alluded to before in the highlights, this is actually my favorite announcement.
4719720	4729080	Castle Crashers, Galaga Legions, Braid, Bionic Commander Rearmed, Geometry Wars 2, all gonna
4729080	4735840	be out on Xbox Live Arcade within the next 4-6 weeks.
4735840	4739440	That's fucking awesome.
4739440	4746760	Other things, Halo Wars, supposed to be out the first half of 2009, looked kind of cool.
4746760	4756960	There was some other stuff, let's see here, actually I want to say that August 6 is when
4756960	4762020	Geometry Wars 2 is going to be coming out, so that's pretty cool.
4762020	4767920	Not really part of the press conference, but Apogee came back, remember them?
4767920	4769560	They used to do shareware games.
4769560	4770560	Yes, they were awesome.
4770560	4771560	But isn't that pronounced Apogee?
4771560	4772560	I think it is Apogee.
4772560	4775240	Jill of the Jungle, like what?
4775240	4780320	Well, they're bringing Duke Nukem to the handhelds, which made me ask, where the fuck's
4780320	4783360	Duke Nukem Forever, bastards?
4783360	4787280	But that was interesting.
4787280	4792480	They showed off a Resistance Fall Man PSP game, that's due out Spring of 2009, it's
4792480	4797880	gonna be kind of like the Killzone PSP game, so that's kind of interesting.
4797880	4805520	And this is gonna make you very happy, Rob, actually, there's, well, not really, there's
4805520	4809560	rumors that, you know, that MotionPlus controller add-on that they're gonna have, yeah, eventually
4809560	4812400	it's gonna be integrated into the Wii remote, so.
4812400	4813400	Shock.
4813400	4817360	So yeah, all that money wasted for stuff that should have been there in the first place.
4817360	4818360	Ha!
4818360	4823640	I just glanced at Justin.tv, I forgot about this one, did you see the Sony game Fat Princess?
4823640	4829640	Farmboy44 in the Justin.tv chat says that, that game looks hilarious.
4829640	4833840	That does look funny.
4833840	4839480	And then I wanna say that, I'm trying to think what else that was really cool coming out
4839480	4840480	of there.
4840480	4845040	I don't know, some of the gameplay stuff that they were showing off, like Resident Evil
4845040	4849560	5 looked kind of neat with the co-op and stuff that they announced that you can do there.
4849560	4854840	And I don't know, the Playstation home stuff looked alright.
4854840	4860200	The one cool thing that really impressed me though about the Playstation conference was
4860200	4865680	that they showed off, actually part of their presentation was done in LittleBigPlanet.
4865680	4866680	And it was really cool.
4866680	4868520	That was cool, I saw a little bit of that, that's neat.
4868520	4871560	See, that's how you make their conferences interesting, okay?
4871560	4875840	That game has me absolutely excited, can't wait to play that, October for that one at
4875840	4876840	least.
4876840	4881800	And I wanna say that was pretty much it.
4881800	4889520	There was really, you know, no big game announcements as far as like DS stuff I think.
4889520	4893220	I mean everyone was expecting like, I think they announced a new Pokemon Rangers game
4893220	4896480	which is just whoopee doo.
4896480	4900520	No Pokemon Platinum announcement, even though we know that's coming.
4900520	4905560	But once again, Nintendo said that this E3 conference was not about the core gamer, it
4905560	4911920	was about casual gamers, which, okay, I guess we'll just have to wait until you announce
4911920	4912920	all the cool stuff.
4912920	4916240	You know, get the crap out of the way, I guess.
4916240	4920080	Alright, well we have plenty more to announce about E3 a little later in the show from the
4920080	4922440	other companies that weren't just the big three.
4922440	4927000	We'll be getting into more of that in part B tonight as well as some other non-E3 news
4927000	4929320	that happened this week if you can believe it.
4929320	4932960	But before we take our break and get to part B, it just would not be an episode of Orange
4932960	4934000	Lounge Radio.
4934000	4939680	If we didn't take a minute to pay some respect to our elders in gaming and Dark Soccer, having
4939680	4943560	gone to California Extreme, I'm sure must have been inspired from hundreds of games
4943560	4944560	this week.
4944560	4946240	I actually didn't see this one there though.
4946240	4947240	Wow.
4947240	4948240	I was a little disappointed.
4948240	4955920	Huh, alright, so we have something completely, I guess, outside of the realm of what you
4955920	4960080	saw, just something you were hoping and thinking about this week, so it must be pretty darn
4960080	4961080	good.
4961080	4962080	Let's take a look.
4962080	4963080	It's the Classic Game of the Week.
4963080	4965920	What should the kids be playing this week?
4965920	4972760	The game of the week is Kix, which is one of my all-time, all-time favorite games ever,
4972760	4976720	which became also the model for later some like, Galaxian gaming.
4976720	4977720	Hell yeah!
4977720	4978720	Woo!
4978720	4983320	But you hear the sounds, this is what you got when you played.
4983320	4988360	It was this little vector series of lines that would move across an empty rectangular
4988360	4990960	space and you were a dot.
4990960	4994960	It's like Attack of the Windows screen savers.
4994960	5003040	And what you had to do is box in to gain a super majority of the screen, so you also
5003040	5007200	had these little spark things though that would travel on your lines that you would
5007200	5014480	form a box in the Kix and it would, if it hit you, it would destroy you also if the
5014480	5018920	Kix hit the line that you were drawing, it would also destroy you and you did have a
5018920	5019920	timer too.
5019920	5031360	So your whole, the whole point of the game was to claim a certain percentage of the screen.
5031360	5037600	I've actually managed to get the 95 percentile closure on the screen before just by making
5037600	5038600	a trap box.
5038600	5043280	It requires some pretty good strategy to do well.
5043280	5053760	But there's also a fuse that will burn out part of the line.
5053760	5059720	It actually will, if it makes it from one way, from one side to the other, then you'll
5059720	5062140	actually lose your life.
5062140	5068320	But that's if you stop moving, if you start moving again the fuse will stop where it is.
5068320	5074240	Also as the game got, as you progress through the game, you would actually get two Kix on
5074240	5079720	the screen, which you could actually easily pass the level if you could bisect the screen
5079720	5083440	so that one was on either side.
5083440	5088400	It really is a lot harder than it sounds, it's a very difficult game past the first
5088400	5093760	couple of stages, but it's one of my all time favorites, it really is.
5093760	5094760	It's pretty awesome.
5094760	5096280	Have you ever played Super Kix?
5096280	5098100	No, I have not.
5098100	5100880	They have it available on MAME, that's the only way I've played it, it's a little more
5100880	5103480	graphics in it, but kind of fun.
5103480	5111520	The versions of Kix that I have is the Atari 5200 version and the Nintendo version of Kix.
5111520	5117080	And it's really so simple, and very frustrating, and I'm like, I'm going to beat these stupid
5117080	5118280	lines into a circle.
5118280	5123320	Yeah, I remember in Super Kix you could get letters that you would actually unveil if
5123320	5126800	you siphoned off certain parts of the screen, which is kind of interesting.
5126800	5133000	But in the way that this, though, has been incorporated into, like, Gals Panic is uncovering
5133000	5137040	certain portions of the screen instead of covering them with your blocks.
5137040	5141280	And you get to see some boobies if you uncover the right part of the screen, like in Ms.
5141280	5146160	World 96 Nude, which you know is an OLR favorite.
5146160	5147160	Yes.
5147160	5148160	Alright.
5148160	5154000	No, but the old school Kix is pretty awesome, so, alright.
5154000	5161920	So, one other thing, the versions that are out, by the way, is Atari 5200, Commodore
5161920	5171240	64, DOS, Amiga, which is graphically enhanced, Apple IIGS, Game Boy, I actually do have the
5171240	5175320	Game Boy version now that I'm thinking about it, NES and Atari Lynx.
5175320	5182160	There was a port for the Game Boy Color that was called Kix Adventure.
5182160	5186280	And then, I don't know if you're saying that it's on GameTab right now.
5186280	5191880	And you can also find it emulated on multiple systems and get Taito Legends 2 and Taito
5191880	5194320	Legends Power Up on PSP.
5194320	5196520	Act Def says Kix for Xbox Live Arcade.
5196520	5197600	Dude, yes.
5197600	5199800	But you were mentioning Super Kix.
5199800	5204680	And those Kix 2 tournament in 1982 and Super Kix that you were talking about, and there's
5204680	5209560	Twin Kix that was a prototype as of 1995 that never came out.
5209560	5216760	However, there is a main release that you can play, and then there was Volfield, but
5216760	5220560	it was Ultimate Kix Neo on PlayStation.
5220560	5222660	So there's also, of course, cell phone versions.
5222660	5226640	And as I was saying before, Gals Panic was also based off of Kix.
5226640	5230560	It's almost a dead clone of it, except for boobs.
5230560	5241800	Capcoma Night in Busyland, which was on SNES, Jezzball Sonics, Eric's Stix, Ultimate Kix.
5241800	5244200	There's actually a mini game version in Bully.
5244200	5249880	And Stix Reloaded, which was a freeware version, were all knockoffs of Kix.
5249880	5251760	So plenty of ways to get your Kix on.
5251760	5252760	Yeah.
5252760	5253760	All right.
5253760	5256320	Well, that's going to do it for this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
5256320	5259440	We're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5259440	5262480	And if you're listening on the podcast, that means just let it keep playing, because we're
5262480	5266000	going to take a quick commercial break, and we'll be, actually, we're calling them not
5266000	5268880	commercial breaks, because they're just not paid stuff.
5268880	5273420	I want to say with that, too, well, I'll explain it at the beginning of Part B. We're accepting
5273420	5274420	your contributions for this.
5274420	5276060	So what's the antonym of commercial?
5276060	5277060	I'm not sure.
5277060	5278060	Anti-commercial?
5278060	5279060	Public service announcement?
5279060	5280060	Anti-commercial?
5280060	5281060	Non-commercial?
5281060	5282960	They're non-commercial breaks.
5282960	5283960	Yes.
5283960	5284960	They're indie commercial breaks.
5284960	5285960	I don't know.
5285960	5288600	Well, commercial means pretty much something for money, right?
5288600	5289600	They're free breaks.
5289600	5290600	Free breaks.
5290600	5291600	Yes.
5291600	5292600	We're going to take a free break.
5292600	5293600	There we go.
5293600	5294600	We're going to take a free break.
5294600	5296120	Just to explain really quickly, it's probably the only time I'm going to mention that.
5296120	5299860	For those of you on the podcast, you will only hear our original stuff and the promos
5299860	5301080	on the free break.
5301080	5305220	For those of you that are listening live tonight, you're going to hear a song or two as well,
5305220	5308520	because we actually need to take a stretch break, get some water and all that good stuff,
5308520	5310480	so you get a little bit longer when you're listening live.
5310480	5319440	But we'll be right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5319440	5320440	Hi.
5320440	5324400	This is your buddy Rob Roberts here from Orange Lounge Radio with an important message.
5324400	5329360	Every year, thousands of yellow wizards are about to die from a horrible outbreak, food
5329360	5330720	shooting.
5330720	5336040	Shooting food causes the loss of life in many red warriors and green elves across the planet.
5336040	5341360	Health needs food badly, so please, think twice before shooting food this holiday season.
5341360	5345720	The blue Valkyrie is about to die, and if you shoot the damn food and vaporize the bag
5345720	5349840	that looks like flour or oatmeal or some shit, it's all your fault.
5349840	5359280	Remember, don't shoot food.
5359280	5364640	From the makers of Sky's Voice the Game, Cosplayers vs. Furries and Orange Lounge Revolution comes
5364640	5370760	Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
5370760	5371760	That's right.
5371760	5375760	The highly anticipated sequel to the community created hit using the DDR simulation program
5375760	5380320	Step Media is back and with a whole new list of ass-piping, anal-fisting, ocean-pissing
5380320	5381720	new songs danced in.
5381720	5386480	You'll play all new theme choruses and brand new songs inspired and sung by all your favorite
5386480	5406360	Orange Lounge Radio hosts like Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura.
5406360	5409680	Please note there are no real songs sung by Dark Sakura because it would lead to the entire
5409680	5413360	Orange Lounge Revolution team being physically castrated, dying in a bow fire on an ocean
5413360	5416640	of piss while being incinerated by an underwater volcano, sorry.
5416640	5428080	You'll also hear songs from Travis Donovan, John D.M.N.
5428080	5443880	and a ton of licensed music inspired by the show that the RIAA and North Steel UT don't
5443880	5445200	want you to hear.
5445200	5448680	So come and reserve your copy of Orange Lounge Revolution Second Mix.
5448680	5453520	When you do, you'll be automatically signed up for the online beta of whattheyplayed.com.
5453520	5457680	It's hot, it's new, oh snap, it's taking pictures of two guys kissing a disembodied head while
5457680	5463360	on top of a couple having sex shouting fuck, but I pooped from there, ha ha there you go.
5463360	5465520	And it's only from the Nintendo Wave.

5478120	5483800	Orange Lounge Radio, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice because the
5483800	5491440	army was using Halo on a sniper base to do one thing, to get the snipers prepared psychologically
5491440	5496080	to be willing to kill as snipers, well except that asshole.
5496080	5502600	And now back to Orange Lounge Radio, there's a direct causal link between interactive gameplay
5502600	5507360	of violent games and real world increased aggression and violence in adolescents and
5507360	5508360	teenagers.
5508360	5516480	Someone get the hook, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio on this lovely July 20th, 2008.
5516480	5521040	Jamie has a very perplexed look on her face, it looks like she swallowed a fly, I'm twitching,
5521040	5527560	I hope she won't die, um, you'll have to swallow a spider to catch the fly, wow, bringing us
5527560	5531640	back to grade school, I don't know why I swallowed a fly, we're bringing it back to grade school
5531640	5535120	here on Orange Lounge Radio, we're so old school, we're preschool, hey if you want your
5535120	5539160	promo or your funny PSA play, because that was all in house stuff tonight, including
5539160	5544520	the Grand Theft Auto 4 entry from a few months ago by the 100A SSJ 100 Matt, if you have
5544520	5548840	some other stuff that you would like to contribute, including hey if you have a podcast, we have
5548840	5552280	people calling in to our program to hoard their own podcast, if you have a website,
5552280	5557040	as long as it is not for profit and you're a hobbyist, by all means, send us your promo,
5557040	5560880	there's more information available on Orange Lounge Radio.com, just get in touch with me,
5560880	5562040	we'll play it on a future show.
5562040	5567000	If it's funny, we'll definitely play it, but if it's not funny, we'll put it in line.
5567000	5574240	Alright, for now though, we're back to it, here on episode number 288, if I haven't lost
5574240	5579360	count of Orange Lounge Radio, whew, haha Rob can count, I can, I'm a winner, alright, more
5579360	5583000	news from E3 that didn't necessarily directly have to do with the press conference, Loki
5583000	5587720	start us off, um, there was an announcement, I don't know why they decided to cut this
5587720	5592160	because it's, I don't know, it seems kind of no-brainer to me that I would announce
5592160	5596240	this during an E3 press conference, but there was a new Halo game that they were going to
5596240	5601800	be announcing, but meh, we didn't have time, that was literally the excuse, we didn't have
5601800	5613120	time, um, could put out a, you know, written press release about it, um, I did know that,
5613120	5619280	like, I want to say the, a Walmart, they had a listing in their database for a game called
5619280	5624280	Halo Blue, whatever the hell that's supposed to be, so, is that like Pepsi Blue?
5624280	5629080	I hope not, because Pepsi Blue looked like Windex and probably tasted like Windex, it
5629080	5633560	kind of did taste like Windex, actually, did you ever have Pepsi Blue?
5633560	5639640	No, because it looked like Windex, well, this is, this is, you know, my thought, Red Bull
5639640	5645400	looks like pee, so I don't drink that, Pepsi Blue looked like Windex, so I wouldn't drink
5645400	5646400	that.
5646400	5650800	What if a new drink, drink came out that looked like paint, would you smell it?
5650800	5651800	No.
5651800	5652800	Okay, just curious.
5652800	5654400	I didn't sniff paint.
5654400	5658840	I think they should do a new Halo game based off of Red versus Blue, which would be fucking
5658840	5659840	awesome.
5659840	5664240	There you go, alright, so, no, in all seriousness, you know, okay, so a Halo, a Halo announcement
5664240	5668400	gets pulled for time, uh, wow, what the heck, I mean, did they maybe just not have enough
5668400	5671280	to go off of, maybe this game is just way too early in development?
5671280	5673000	Are they sitting on it for PAX?
5673000	5678180	Are they waiting for the giant orgasm that will fill the Seattle Convention Center when
5678180	5679180	that's announced?
5679180	5680180	Do I smell Omega-Thon?
5680180	5685720	Well, I might be a little early for that, I don't know about that, uh, I don't know.
5685720	5690720	Dude, we get to watch Omega-Thon this year, that's gonna be kind of rad, we'll have to
5690720	5691720	see.
5691720	5692720	We'll have to sign up for Omega-Thon if we can.
5692720	5695120	You can't, it's randomly chosen out of people that pre-register.
5695120	5696760	Damn it, alright, that's right.
5696760	5701400	And I, I think if we did get in as press, yeah, we probably wouldn't get to do that,
5701400	5705640	but if we don't get in as press, then that's disappointing.
5705640	5706640	Alright.
5706640	5709040	Cause even they have denied us.
5709040	5714280	Well, look, anyhow, so maybe this Halo game is just being waited on till later, but when
5714280	5717400	later is, who knows, maybe they'll just sit on it till next year when there's actually
5717400	5718800	more game to show.
5718800	5722480	Because even if they did announce it, I'm sure it's not a game coming out till 2010.
5722480	5723480	We'll see.
5723480	5726840	And the game we had no idea was coming out here at Orange Laundry Radio, this completely
5726840	5729400	took me by surprise at E3, was Dead Rising for the Wii.
5729400	5732560	I don't know about you guys, but I was just, like, floored by this announcement.
5732560	5733560	What?
5733560	5734560	Cause I've never heard of this before.
5734560	5735560	Dead Rising for the Wii?
5735560	5736560	I know.
5736560	5737560	That's just insane.
5737560	5738560	Alright.
5738560	5743360	That's such a unique idea to me, I've never thought of Dead Rising on the Wii.
5743360	5746440	Well here's the thing, is that, you know, in all seriousness, even though, you know,
5746440	5749760	it has been announced as coming out for the Wii, apparently they're, I don't wanna say
5749760	5752720	they're dumbing it down a little bit, but they kinda are.
5752720	5757560	Basically, the real-time missions are gonna be gone, now you're gonna have sub-missions
5757560	5761640	that you beat in the game, and then you'll do a major plotline quest.
5761640	5764600	So now the game has become a little more linear.
5764600	5767040	But some people actually think that might be a good thing, because some people thought
5767040	5770440	the 360, the way it was done there, was a little bit frustrating.
5770440	5776480	The camera apparently has now been changed, and now it's a behind and above type view,
5776480	5778380	more like what they had in Resident Evil 4.
5778380	5781820	So now it's kinda like one of those over-the-shoulder things.
5781820	5786240	And the photo mode is now gone, so you can't take, you know, the pictures, like you did
5786240	5787240	in the 360 one.
5787240	5788240	But it was kinda...
5788240	5789240	I won't miss it.
5789240	5790240	It was a little silly, anyway.
5790240	5791240	I mean, it was fun for a minute.
5791240	5794120	As long as you can still run over zombies with a lawnmower, I'm happy.
5794120	5796600	That's really all you need, I mean, to make Dead Rising.
5796600	5801160	And please, God, save... or, save the save system.
5801160	5803240	No, fix the save system.
5803240	5804240	Please.
5804240	5808360	Alright, well, Dead Rising Wii coming out soon.
5808360	5811960	And by soon he means January.
5811960	5818480	Well, you know, and I remember Bobby actually mentioning this on his show earlier, but there's
5818480	5821440	some higher-ups that hate E3.
5821440	5822640	Hate it, hate it, hate it, the way it is.
5822640	5826800	I like to consider myself one of those higher-ups, but apparently I'm the only one that does
5826800	5827800	that.
5827800	5836160	Well, it was actually stated by the EA big guy, okay, now I'm gonna totally butcher his
5836160	5837160	last name.
5837160	5838200	His first name is John.
5838200	5839200	His...
5839200	5840200	Riccitello?
5840200	5841200	I think?
5841200	5842200	Whatever.
5842200	5847040	Anyway, he says, he's quoted as saying, I hate E3 like this, and that they want to go
5847040	5850240	back to the old E3 or do their own private events.
5850240	5856400	And the Ubisoft director, well, the Ubisoft boss said, yeah, it was terrible.
5856400	5859560	In fact, to quote him, he said, E3 this year was terrible.
5859560	5865560	The world used to come to E3, now it's like Pipefitter's show in the basement.
5865560	5870080	I think that the EA guy would be complaining, seeing as, well, EA was one of the four major
5870080	5875420	companies that approached, you know, the ESA and said, we want you to change E3 because
5875420	5876820	we don't like it the way it is.
5876820	5878600	They're never satisfied.
5878600	5879600	They don't know what they want.
5879600	5881600	They're like a little kid.
5881600	5891840	Well, there was, it actually was the Ubisoft, someone from Ubisoft named Alain Corr was
5891840	5899760	also, you know, saying that he didn't really care for it all that either, too.
5899760	5908320	But one of the things that I think should be pointed out is that while they, yeah, they
5908320	5912000	were the ones that wanted it, I think they didn't expect it to turn out the way that
5912000	5913600	it did.
5913600	5919680	That I think that it was such a drastic departure that they are just now beginning to see, you
5919680	5923800	know, to them what would be a detriment.
5923800	5929760	One thing that I think was pointed out by Corey is that he's kind of saying it's one
5929760	5934440	milestone in the communication of your products throughout the year and it's important because
5934440	5940760	it's the ramp on for Christmas, but he had said that in mid-July that wouldn't be something
5940760	5941760	appropriate.
5941760	5945140	Now, what I'm thinking is that if they wanted their big event, they should do something
5945140	5947440	closer to the end of the year.
5947440	5956560	You know, have E3 be your meetings and everything and then do E3 to the sequel in November or
5956560	5957560	something.
5957560	5959320	Which is what E4 All was supposed to be.
5959320	5960720	But people didn't see that way.
5960720	5963960	It should still be the same E3, I think.
5963960	5965640	The same format as before.
5965640	5969440	EA still kind of strikes me as the Goldilocks of the game industry right now.
5969440	5971740	This convention is too big.
5971740	5974160	This convention is too small.
5974160	5977600	They're looking for a convention that's just right.
5977600	5979760	But you know, I don't know.
5979760	5985560	All that aside, I just think publishers, in part, the people that were going to E3 are
5985560	5989840	partially to blame for why E3 went in the crapper.
5989840	5995200	I mean, the year Paris Hilton showed up at E3, that was the year I was like, something
5995200	5996200	ain't right.
5996200	5999820	I just can't believe the people who actually wanted to go see her.
5999820	6000820	So blame yourself.
6000820	6003560	I mean, honestly, blame yourselves for ruining E3.
6003560	6007520	I think if they're going to bring E3 back on a big spectacle, which it seems like maybe
6007520	6012520	EA is going to start bullying them to do it, have some freaking responsibility with what
6012520	6014160	you decide to show at these shows.
6014160	6016680	I don't care if Paris Hilton has a cell phone game coming out.
6016680	6018280	Keep it the fuck out of my show.
6018280	6023160	I think that what they should do if they're going to have the celebrity events like that,
6023160	6029600	they put them in the, what was the other hall that the little games had to hang out in?
6029600	6030600	Cancha.
6030600	6031600	Yeah, they need to hang out there.
6031600	6035960	I don't have a problem with them bringing celebrities or even non-celebrities like Paris
6035960	6039600	Hilton because you know what, that's up to the game publishers how they want to promote
6039600	6042220	their game and stuff and if they want to do that, fine.
6042220	6046340	You don't have to go see it, it's whatever.
6046340	6049280	I do think though that they have to figure out what the hell they're trying to actually
6049280	6053060	accomplish with E3 because the whole thing before was, it's getting crazy because there's
6053060	6056280	too many people here and we can't get business done.
6056280	6060020	Well, now that it's more intimate, are you getting business done?
6060020	6064400	Obviously you're not satisfied the way it is, then what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
6064400	6069320	I think once they figure that out, you know, maybe, I don't know, let's not take such extremes.
6069320	6074480	Maybe we just keep it the way it used to be but I don't know, make it slightly more restrictive
6074480	6077480	on who gets in.
6077480	6083240	I don't know, it's just, what they need to do is just find a happy medium.
6083240	6093400	Alright, well, let's move on.
6093400	6101360	So other EA related news is that EA formed a partnership now with id Software and of
6101360	6108000	course that also means that their brand new first person shooter title, Rage, is going
6108000	6113640	to be published by EA, so that's kind of neat.
6113640	6122120	Some other, I wonder if that also includes Doom 4 which got teased, I don't think they
6122120	6129440	actually announced anything for that, hmm, interesting.
6129440	6136840	But yet another big company, or big developer I guess to get under their EA belt, hopefully
6136840	6138600	do something with it.
6138600	6142560	Slowly, this big collective is being built even more and more.
6142560	6147160	You will be assimilated into the big EA.
6147160	6150560	One thing that's not getting assimilated to EA though, because this is a Konami thing,
6150560	6157280	this is Gradius Rebirth, this is kind of interesting, it's almost as if Mega Man 9 was just the
6157280	6160760	beginning because now apparently there's this new Gradius game that's going to be coming
6160760	6165640	out for the Wii on WiiWare, I mean no news yet if it's going to come out for Xbox and
6165640	6170000	PlayStation Network as well like Mega Man 9 is supposed to be, but apparently Gradius
6170000	6174080	Rebirth is going to be coming out on the Japanese Wii systems around this summer, probably next
6174080	6178600	month or so, but it's apparently what this game is, if it's a remake of Gradius 1 or
6178600	6183160	if it's a new Gradius game, that quite is not known just yet.
6183160	6186920	The old school Gradius though is already available on the Virtual Console, so I would think this
6186920	6191480	is some type of new adventure maybe based on the old Gradius, but you know this is kind
6191480	6194680	of one of those series that people said they were kind of sad when it died, like there
6194680	6198320	was the one, there was what, Gradius 5 on the PlayStation 2 and then it kind of disappeared,
6198320	6199320	so this is kind of neat.
6199320	6203080	Jamie, I know you're a big Gradius fan, is this something you're excited about?
6203080	6204080	Anything Gradius we get.
6204080	6207680	And it even has the Moai heads in it, which is pretty rad.
6207680	6209880	You can't have Gradius without Moai heads.
6209880	6212240	Absolutely, so that's going to be pretty cool.
6212240	6218000	Coming out in Japan this summer and I'm imagining America soon enough.
6218000	6223360	In other news, I guess sort of related to the Wii, this is actually supposed to go with
6223360	6231160	my previous story about the status of E3, but Miyamoto is quoted as saying that E3 is
6231160	6237560	no longer where they're going to be showing off games for the core audience, and we did
6237560	6245040	mention this earlier in the show, but he said that, he's quoted as saying that for a very
6245040	6250800	long time E3 was an event where I guess the developers catered specifically to the core
6250800	6255840	gamer, so they're actually using it as something to bounce off the mass public, the casual
6255840	6261200	gamer, their new market that they're trying to get ahold of.
6261200	6268040	But he said that E3 isn't the right place to point out their classics like Zelda or
6268040	6274160	their major titles that have been their staple, that the people really, that their fans actually
6274160	6277120	care about.
6277120	6280520	I don't know about you guys, but hearing this makes me a little bit angsty because it makes
6280520	6284160	me think of the way E3 used to be, which was actually pretty cool, like the year before
6284160	6285880	Paris Hilton showed up.
6285880	6290360	And when I get angsty, we cue some nasty music and say some nasty things in a segment we
6290360	6295360	call the F.U. of the Week.
6295360	6310280	F.U. to the woman who nearly ran into my car on Friday.
6310280	6316840	I was coming out of the parking lot to turn right onto the road so that I could go back
6316840	6326120	to work, and this woman turns directly into my car trying to pull into the entrance side
6326120	6332360	of this little entrance leading back onto the road, and lo and behold, the bitch was
6332360	6334800	on her phone.
6334800	6340560	And Julie and I rolled down the windows and said, hang up your goddamn phone.
6340560	6341560	And she looked confused.
6341560	6346280	And I was like, bitch, if both of your hands had been on the wheel, you could have controlled
6346280	6348480	the wheel enough to turn it in all the way.
6348480	6352640	It was very clear she was trying to turn the wheel with her hand and her elbow.
6352640	6357720	Like, bitch, your phone conversation is not worth, you know, risking my life over.
6357720	6359920	Hang up your goddamn phone.
6359920	6362520	The end.
6362520	6372680	Anyways, F.U. to stupid people at movie theaters who get there either at the time of the showing
6372680	6379040	or five minutes prior to it and expect to find a good seat, especially when people have
6379040	6383000	sat down and have maybe one seat next to them and they want you to move over.
6383000	6384000	You know what?
6384000	6388360	I didn't get to the movie 50 minutes early, you know, just to have some idiot come right
6388360	6392400	on time and tell me the move because you don't want to sit up front.
6392400	6393400	It's a little tough.
6393400	6394400	You know what?
6394400	6396680	If I got to a movie right as it's starting, then I expect to sit in the front and you
6396680	6397680	should too.
6397680	6399520	So fuck you inconsiderate bitches.
6399520	6401920	And she was a fat cow too.
6401920	6405320	She was playing with her cell phone during the movie.
6405320	6407480	What is it with cell phones this week?
6407480	6411840	My cell, F.U. to my cell phone because I can't get opera mini to work on it anymore.
6411840	6412840	So F that.
6412840	6417040	But my real F.U. is to having to make difficult decisions.
6417040	6421400	Well, I have two difficult decisions to make in my life right now.
6421400	6425640	One is that my doctor is like not sure if I should have a surgery or not and leaving
6425640	6426640	it up to me.
6426640	6429760	Like, I'm like, OK, so I get to decide if I have surgery or not.
6429760	6431680	That's kind of neat, I guess.
6431680	6435600	So I decide I'm going to go get a second opinion because I can't make decisions by myself.
6435600	6440240	But the other one is that I've decided I kind of have too many hobbies going on right now.
6440240	6443400	So I've made a difficult decision that I'm going to be cutting one of them out.
6443400	6444400	It's not this one.
6444400	6445400	Don't worry.
6445400	6452600	And it's always difficult because that kind of thing usually never gets taken well by
6452600	6455200	the other people you might be involved with something with.
6455200	6457280	And it's going to be difficult.
6457280	6458640	And I haven't said anything yet.
6458640	6460600	So I don't know what I'm going to do.
6460600	6463840	But you know, I think people just kind of have to understand, look, I have priorities
6463840	6466520	and sadly, you're the lowest priority now.
6466520	6469560	So that's what I what's a general way to break that news?
6469560	6474800	You think that's the best way to do it?
6474800	6476520	I got to do what I got to do.
6476520	6479040	So it's not Warcraft either.
6479040	6480040	Sorry.
6480040	6481040	Oh, I was going to say.
6481040	6482040	No, it's not Warcraft.
6482040	6483040	No, no, no.
6483040	6484040	All right.
6484040	6485040	It doesn't matter.
6485040	6487240	It's not the guessing game.
6487240	6488720	It's something.
6488720	6493400	It's something big that I'm going to hate to get away from.
6493400	6495800	But I have to do it for me.
6495800	6497280	I'll tell you later.
6497280	6498280	I don't know.
6498280	6499280	I couldn't read your lips.
6499280	6500280	All right.
6500280	6501280	All right.
6501280	6504280	So that's it for the FUs of the Week.
6504280	6505360	Other people are quitting WoW.
6505360	6506360	I'm not.
6506360	6507360	I still love WoW.
6507360	6508360	WoW's great.
6508360	6509360	But I don't play it every day anymore.
6509360	6511960	I play it once in a while.
6511960	6516160	Apparently somebody out there was actually listening to me, or at least thought the same
6516160	6519280	thing when I saw the movie Wanted.
6519280	6522680	They are bringing a Wanted game out to the market.
6522680	6526680	Universal and Grin are working on a Wanted game.
6526680	6532080	And it will allow you to do all the fun stuff like curbing bullets and going into assassin
6532080	6534840	time as they call it.
6534840	6538320	Only sad thing though is it's coming out on Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360.
6538320	6542400	I was really hoping for a Wii Wanted game because I really think that would be cool.
6542400	6544640	Especially with the new Motion Plus.
6544640	6548840	Now you can attach that to the bottom of your Nyko Perfect Shot and curve the bullets that
6548840	6549840	way.
6549840	6550840	But whatever.
6550840	6553240	This will be cool though.
6553240	6554240	Worth checking out.
6554240	6558240	Hopefully it will be out around the time when the DVD comes out which is holiday maybe.
6558240	6564680	But if we're just seeing it now and it hasn't been developed for a while, it could be crap.
6564680	6566680	It scares me.
6566680	6571080	Alright, well one thing I get to look forward to in World of Warcraft since I didn't leave
6571080	6574400	it is that I'll be getting my own achievements in Warcraft soon.
6574400	6575400	That's right.
6575400	6576400	You know what?
6576400	6578840	If Microsoft has put out this achievement thing it's a pretty good thing.
6578840	6582360	Other people are going to start stealing things from Microsoft and Blizzard is one of them.
6582360	6583360	And it's kind of a neat idea.
6583360	6588360	They're going to be doing this achievement system and in the game apparently there's
6588360	6593880	going to be PVP achievements, PvE achievements, achievements for exploring the world, achievements
6593880	6598320	for crafting, achievements for questing and developing your character, I mean all these
6598320	6599320	different things.
6599320	6601800	But what I like is that some of the achievements are silly.
6601800	6606940	There's an achievement that you can unlock for giving 10 hugs to other players.
6606940	6611820	So if you're just a hug slut you get an achievement for that which is kind of funny I think.
6611820	6616660	Apparently there are really, really, really difficult achievements as well called feats
6616660	6618120	of strength.
6618120	6619260	So interesting.
6619260	6622760	I'm assuming this is all going to be able to be tracked on Blizzard's website and the
6622760	6627980	armory and all that fun stuff too but my question is what about all the stuff I've already done?
6627980	6631880	Is WoW going to be capable of knowing that I've done all this stuff on my current level
6631880	6632880	70?
6632880	6633880	Because that's going to suck if I have to start with a whole new character.
6633880	6637680	Well that's how they're doing the PlayStation trophies is even if you've done this crap
6637680	6641040	it's not going to be able to know based on your save game you have to go back and actually
6641040	6642040	do it again.
6642040	6643040	Right, right.
6643040	6645880	You know other websites have, was I going to say Newgrounds kind of does something similar
6645880	6647760	with their flash games.
6647760	6652760	Actually all the flash games have kind of trophies built into it and stuff.
6652760	6658520	So that's kind of neat that they do that too and you know I think WoW doing it, it's a
6658520	6662160	great idea especially if they do it right and hopefully some of these other publishers
6662160	6667960	out there that are making Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games take note of this and actually do
6667960	6672100	the achievements correct instead of just beat level one, beat level two.
6672100	6676120	Make them fun, make them different.
6676120	6679560	Alrighty, very cool.
6679560	6687300	Well something else that's fairly cool and this actually has to do with Silent Hill Homecoming.
6687300	6694080	They were actually showing that there will be our good buddy with the Red Pyramid hanging
6694080	6701740	out in part of Silent Hill Homecoming and that it's going to have a PC version.
6701740	6705280	So that's pretty cool.
6705280	6708380	Just like I guess the ones before it except for the very first one.
6708380	6710040	But that's pretty cool information.
6710040	6714960	I mean he would have to be, because I mean my whole problem with having Pyramid Head
6714960	6719900	in the movie even as cool as it was, was that he was supposed to be like a part of the main
6719900	6725720	character psychosis and I doubt that she has anything about the lady in the movie had anything
6725720	6728480	about sadomasochism so I don't know.
6728480	6734360	But maybe this guy does, the main protagonist of Silent Hill Homecoming, Alex Shepard.
6734360	6738040	I was actually going to ask you about that.
6738040	6743520	Are you going to forgive it for kind of maybe bending the lore in Silent Hill to give the
6743520	6746760	fanservice of having Red Pyramid, Pyramid Head, whatever in the game?
6746760	6751720	We did have some reoccurring critters, you know, certain same types of things.
6751720	6752720	Like the nurses.
6752720	6753720	The nurses.
6753720	6754720	Yeah, the nurses.
6754720	6760560	But I mean I think that maybe it's just that if they're going to do it this way then I
6760560	6765440	think that maybe that's just how the town manifests that certain feeling or something,
6765440	6767520	that certain part of someone's psyche.
6767520	6769080	As long as he rapes things.
6769080	6775320	We got Pyramid Head, for those who don't know, he goes around having his way with the female
6775320	6782440	creatures of the town of Silent Hill, including the double-sided mannequins and the nurses,
6782440	6786560	and then he goes around stabbing random women who keep regenerating.
6786560	6788480	I need to watch the Silent Hill movie again.
6788480	6789480	God, it was great.
6789480	6790720	Come over to my house, we'll watch it.
6790720	6792040	Seriously, I want to watch it on Blu-ray.
6792040	6793040	I bet it's pretty.
6793040	6794040	I need to get it.
6794040	6795040	You don't have it on Blu-ray.
6795040	6796040	No, I want it.
6796040	6797040	And my husband's a butthole.
6797040	6799040	He did it on Blu-ray, maybe he still has it.
6799040	6800360	Didn't we watch it on Blu-ray once?
6800360	6802920	I mean, I love my husband very much, he's not always a butthole.
6802920	6804800	We did it at your apartment, your old apartment.
6804800	6806120	I don't think we watched the whole thing.
6806120	6807120	Yeah.
6807120	6808120	You can bring it over.
6808120	6810820	But I've got, like, the humongoly TV.
6810820	6813720	We need Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Night.
6813720	6815840	Okay.
6815840	6816840	Maybe that should be a holiday.
6816840	6817840	I hear the rabbit-
6817840	6819960	An official holiday on Orange Mounds Radio.
6819960	6820960	I hear the Creepy-
6820960	6826360	Was it the Creepy Rabbits from number two, I think, or back at school?
6826360	6829020	We have to also have nurses, we have to have nurses.
6829020	6831240	And I want the screaming things.
6831240	6836000	I would ask the chat room, what day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?
6836000	6838800	Not Halloween, that's too obvious, some other day.
6838800	6842320	What day should Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day be?
6842320	6843320	So we'll see.
6843320	6844320	Tuesday.
6844320	6845320	September 12th.
6845320	6846320	Why is that?
6846320	6847320	I don't know.
6847320	6848320	The day after your birthday?
6848320	6852320	Well, you could do it, how would the release date of Silent Hill Homecoming-
6852320	6853320	Oh, there you go.
6853320	6854320	Or the day before.
6854320	6855760	What was the day that Silent Hill 2 came out?
6855760	6857700	I don't know, I'll have to look that up.
6857700	6859480	That should be Pyramid Head-
6859480	6862600	I will look that up and we will dub that Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
6862600	6865400	I will look that up right now while we get into another story.
6865400	6866400	Awesome.
6866400	6871040	Well, this is kind of weird and it may not actually be a confirmation at all, but apparently
6871040	6877960	there is some people that performed some sort of social engineering prank that had 2K games
6877960	6885080	support believing that there is a hacked version of Grand Theft Auto IV's PC version, at least
6885080	6887760	a demo of it, on a pirate site.
6887760	6894400	And apparently there was some back and forth going on with the tech support to which they
6894400	6899560	replied with, the PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV has not even been announced for release
6899560	6908480	and is still in development, so it's not about to be released on a website.
6908480	6911480	People are reading into that thinking, well it's still in development, well that kind
6911480	6914000	of confirms that it's actually coming out.
6914000	6920400	But the whole thing is does really their tech support know anything about games in development?
6920400	6921400	I don't know.
6921400	6922400	Maybe.
6922400	6926960	I mean, I would think it would be kind of dumb if they didn't put out a PC version.
6926960	6935240	And I know the last few PlayStation 2 games have been on PC, so why not?
6935240	6937560	So maybe it's coming, just might take some time.
6937560	6941940	Alright, and I'm sure that makes a lot of people very happy, especially because PC means
6941940	6943440	easily hackable.
6943440	6944440	Exactly.
6944440	6945440	It means mod crazy.
6945440	6946440	Mod crazy.
6946440	6947440	Alright, here we go.
6947440	6948440	Here's the answer to the question.
6948440	6949440	We did the research.
6949440	6951680	The Silent Hill 2 was released in North America.
6951680	6953360	Believe it or not, North America got it first.
6953360	6955280	Japan got it three days later.
6955280	6957840	September 24th, 2001.
6957840	6959640	Too bad it's not the 23rd.
6959640	6960640	You know, it's funny.
6960640	6967320	September 24th, I think, is very close, if not the exact release date of Homecoming.
6967320	6968320	Interesting.
6968320	6970080	Well, there you have it.
6970080	6971080	So I guess that's it.
6971080	6972080	So do we officially...
6972080	6976160	No, September 24th is a Wednesday this year, so it might be like September 23rd, or that
6976160	6978040	might be the day you actually can get it in a store.
6978040	6981360	If it's the 23rd, then we have the number of consequence.
6981360	6983560	24th can be a release date.
6983560	6985080	Games mostly come out on Wednesdays.
6985080	6986080	Alright, fair enough.
6986080	6987080	It's like a street date.
6987080	6989240	I mean, they have a ship date, but you know.
6989240	6990240	Whatever.
6990240	6991240	I think we...
6991240	6992240	But we have the official word.
6992240	6995040	September 24th is Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
6995040	6996040	Official.
6996040	6997040	Done.
6997040	6998040	Done deal.
6998040	6999040	Get the wax.
6999040	7001320	Let's get the seal, the OLR seal.
7001320	7004120	That's in our new universe of Orange Loungia.
7004120	7005120	Alright.
7005120	7006120	So...
7006120	7010120	I like that, Orange Loungia.
7010120	7013960	How should people celebrate Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day?
7013960	7018980	You can't tell them to rape things, because unfortunately, rape is not funny.
7018980	7023280	You can just have them put on a big cardboard pyramid on their head, and walk around with
7023280	7026600	like, since it's really hard to find a great knife like that, walk around with a plastic
7026600	7027600	knife.
7027600	7029640	Walk around the neighborhood and threaten the cats.
7029640	7030640	In your neighborhood.
7030640	7031640	You have to have a plastic knife.
7031640	7032920	You have to have a plastic knife.
7032920	7034160	And take pictures.
7034160	7035360	Bake Pyramid Head cakes.
7035360	7036360	Yes!
7036360	7037360	Bake Pyramid Head cakes.
7037360	7042320	Pyramid Head cupcakes, and pass them out to the neighbors, and they have to be red velvet.
7042320	7043320	Alright.
7043320	7045880	So we want pictures of you celebrating Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
7045880	7046880	And the best...
7046880	7047880	This year.
7047880	7048880	The best cupcake wins.
7048880	7049880	Something.
7049880	7054200	Wins eaten by the hosts.
7054200	7055200	You know what would be awesome?
7055200	7056200	What?
7056200	7057200	If we had a lot of money.
7057200	7058200	I mean, a lot, a lot of money.
7058200	7059200	What?
7059200	7062960	We'd love to have the cakes to build you a sculpture of Pyramid Head as a cake.
7062960	7063960	Great.
7063960	7065440	I have a friend that makes wedding cakes.
7065440	7066440	I'll have to see.
7066440	7067680	That wouldn't be too bad.
7067680	7071400	Sharan in chat says, can I wear my pyramid shaped tin foil hat instead?
7071400	7072400	You certainly can.
7072400	7073400	But we want pictures.
7073400	7074400	Celebrate in whatever way possible.
7074400	7075400	I like that.
7075400	7076960	Pyramid shaped cupcakes.
7076960	7077960	You could do that.
7077960	7080040	I mean, just kind of take a cupcake and kind of either...
7080040	7081040	Tin foil.
7081040	7082040	You know.
7082040	7083040	You can make your own mold.
7083040	7084040	But no, seriously, contest.
7084040	7086040	Dun dun dun.
7086040	7087040	And the rules are...
7087040	7088040	Just a ways out.
7088040	7090800	The rules are whatever we decide they are at the time.
7090800	7095480	One of them is a costume contest for your best, not necessarily cosplay, but just your
7095480	7097360	best celebration of Pyramid Head.
7097360	7099880	And the second one is how pretty your cupcakes are.
7099880	7100880	I don't know if they'll have...
7100880	7101880	I don't know if Pyramid...
7101880	7102880	Send us pictures.
7102880	7105440	Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day is that PC.
7105440	7106440	I mean...
7106440	7107440	Who cares?
7107440	7110640	I think some people, maybe rape victims might be offended by that.
7110640	7111640	You know?
7111640	7112640	Yeah.
7112640	7113640	I know.
7113640	7114640	We might be offending some people.
7114640	7115640	Okay.
7115640	7116640	It's just Red Pyramid Day.
7116640	7117640	Or Pyramid Head Appreciation Day would be fine.
7117640	7118640	It's funny.
7118640	7119640	Rape of people is not funny.
7119640	7120640	No.
7120640	7121640	Rape of monsters...
7121640	7122640	Is.
7122640	7123640	Funny.
7123640	7124640	Because monsters are bad.
7124640	7125640	And when bad people...
7125640	7126640	Bob.
7126640	7127640	What?
7127640	7128640	I'm just not gonna keep going.
7128640	7129640	Let go of the shovel.
7129640	7130640	I'm gonna...
7130640	7131640	Yeah.
7131640	7132640	I'm digging myself a hole.
7132640	7133640	Okay.
7133640	7134640	How about...
7134640	7135640	What?
7135640	7136640	Pyramid Head Day.
7136640	7137640	I still like Pyramid Head Rape Appreciation Day.
7137640	7138640	But only when you rape monsters.
7138640	7139640	How about the Rape Appreciation Event?
7139640	7140640	You know what they should do?
7140640	7142640	We should have a rape carnival.
7142640	7143640	That'd be cool.
7143640	7148640	Is the mold your own custom, like... or... I can see the hate mail coming from a mile
7148640	7149640	away.
7149640	7154440	We should mold our, like, custom, like, gummy candy, like, molds and make, like, gummy red
7154440	7155440	pyramid heads.
7155440	7156440	We need your ideas of how to...
7156440	7157760	We're gonna make pyramid cakes.
7157760	7161840	We need your ideas of how to turn this into a politically correct event.
7161840	7162840	There's no way, Rob.
7162840	7163840	All right.
7163840	7171320	Um, Shaoran says, uh, I'm offended some of my best friends are monsters, you asshole.
7171320	7175160	And no, Joshi16, there will not be a rape-a-thon this part of the day.
7175160	7176160	This is horrible.
7176160	7177160	No, no, no.
7177160	7178160	No, it's gonna be...
7178160	7179760	It's gonna be Pyramid Head Appreciation Day.
7179760	7180760	All right.
7180760	7182920	Yeah, we'll figure something out.
7182920	7183920	Okay.
7183920	7187560	Anyhow, in a completely different topic, I'm sure there'll be a lot of appreciation for
7187560	7188560	this as well.
7188560	7193080	It has been announced that BioWare and LucasArts, they are building the MMO for Knights of the
7193080	7194080	Old Republic.
7194080	7197520	Now, this is different from the existing Star Wars MMO, but there is that new Knights of
7197520	7200200	the Old Republic MMO that's gonna be going on.
7200200	7207040	It's pretty cool, and you can see this whole thing that's post, I guess it's on portfolio.com,
7207040	7208200	and it has been confirmed.
7208200	7211320	This is Knights of the Round, I'm sorry, Knights of the Round Republic.
7211320	7212600	That would be awesome.
7212600	7214520	Knights of the Round, the old Capcom game.
7214520	7217280	Knights of the Old Republic is online.
7217280	7219000	It's Knights of the Old Old Republic.
7219000	7220600	Shut up.
7220600	7224400	I cannot think of KOTOR without thinking of my friend who tested it and what they called
7224400	7225400	it in office.
7225400	7226400	What's that?
7226400	7227400	Scrotor.
7227400	7228400	Nice.
7228400	7229400	Very nice.
7229400	7231680	So, there you have it.
7231680	7233400	That game will be coming probably in a couple years.
7233400	7236040	It's probably still a little ways out, but I'm sure there's lots of people that are waiting
7236040	7237240	to ditch WoW for that.
7237240	7238840	It'll be good times.
7238840	7239840	Alright.
7239840	7244680	Anyhow, we're gonna get into another segment here on Orange Launch Radio that's good times,
7244680	7246520	because it's the chance for us to hear from the listeners.
7246520	7248240	It's the mailbag segment.
7248240	7253120	Every week we invite your emails at mailbagorangelaunchradio.com, and let's read some of those emails right
7253120	7260800	now.
7260800	7261800	Emails!
7261800	7262800	We have some.
7262800	7263800	The end.
7263800	7264800	Wait, can I jump in here?
7264800	7265800	Because there's a great idea from us if we're in chat.
7265800	7266800	Well.
7266800	7267800	Pyramid Hat Appreciation Day.
7267800	7272040	The day that people across the world wear pyramid hats and rip skin off their fried
7272040	7275440	chicken.
7275440	7276960	So it's ripping skin off chicks?
7276960	7280280	Yeah, but it's chicken.
7280280	7281680	So that way it's politically correct.
7281680	7286080	Well, I think we're- I think ossifers set a good, like, starting point.
7286080	7288160	I think there's a good idea in there somewhere.
7288160	7289160	Anyway.
7289160	7290160	Sorry.
7290160	7291160	Mail.
7291160	7292160	Yeah.
7292160	7293160	Um.
7293160	7294160	From Robwith2bees.
7294160	7298920	A dear two guys, a girl, and an Olive Garden, home of the never-ending salad and breadsticks.
7298920	7301880	Is it me, or is the news from E3 much more boring this year?
7301880	7307920	One of the things that was, um, new, we moats shouldn't add on that more accurately judges
7307920	7310160	the controller's aspect.
7310160	7313680	Can this more or less throw out to your old plastic thingies?
7313680	7318480	Um, it won't fit onto the zapper, so maybe you won't need it for older games, but there
7318480	7320200	will have to be a new zapper.
7320200	7323720	Are two zappers truly better than one?
7323720	7325720	No.
7325720	7330920	Or you can buy the Nyko Perfect Shot and then slap it into the pass-through in the bottom.
7330920	7334480	Not that both games will probably be using the thing at the same time.
7334480	7338920	Or you could just save yourself the money and not buy a zapper because they're shit.
7338920	7341720	I actually don't agree that E3 was necessarily disappointing.
7341720	7342720	I think especially at my-
7342720	7344120	I think boring was the word.
7344120	7347160	I think at Microsoft's camp, I think they did just fine.
7347160	7350600	I mean, you knew that nobody was going to be announcing a new system this year, and
7350600	7354440	I think the only thing that made Microsoft's press conference a little bit, um, we knew
7354440	7356800	that was coming was because of the leak that had already happened.
7356800	7360120	I think if you hadn't known about the avatars in advance, uh, I think it would have been
7360120	7363040	a pretty big deal to see that new dashboard for the first time.
7363040	7364040	Um.
7364040	7367160	And even still, we didn't know that the new dashboard was coming, we just knew that avatars
7367160	7368160	are coming.
7368160	7372760	And the other thing, too, is I like the format of the new E3, um, you know, with all the
7372760	7377000	press conferences because it's very much like gamer's days, and I think it's a lot easier
7377000	7381840	to digest the information, unless of course you're, you know, doing Capcom's press conference
7381840	7386560	where all they did was talk about the fucking, you know, Lost Planet movie, but, you know,
7386560	7388440	no information out of that.
7388440	7389440	Um.
7389440	7396640	But I like the old show, no, show floor of the original E3, so if we can kind of do both,
7396640	7397640	that'd be awesome.
7397640	7398640	We'll see.
7398640	7403720	Well, you notice that when we went to press events, um, our last year of going, they were
7403720	7409400	sort of off in those little rooms, where they had the little trailer area set up inside
7409400	7411920	the, uh, the show floor.
7411920	7414520	I loved it, though, when we got to go to Bethesda's thing, that was great.
7414520	7416480	I loved Bethesda's area, and they were so nice.
7416480	7418160	It was just because it was just chill.
7418160	7420600	And I really actually liked, um, Play and See.
7420600	7421600	Yeah.
7421600	7422600	I really liked it.
7422600	7425560	Everybody that let us in, I think, I just, yeah, I just distinctly remember Bethesda
7425560	7427840	because they had a lot of stuff I was kind of interested in at the time.
7427840	7428840	Um, but.
7428840	7430040	Call of Cthulhu.
7430040	7431040	Where's that?
7431040	7434840	It just, I think any company, you know, even at the old E3, you know, kind of getting off
7434840	7438360	the main floor into those little back rooms and stuff was, was kind of neat.
7438360	7441600	Call of Cthulhu came out in 2005 on the Xbox.
7441600	7443280	I completely missed it.
7443280	7446000	Well, I don't think anyone missed it.
7446000	7449960	I remember being so excited, and then I never heard anything about it, so.
7449960	7456920	Well, to make it up, there is a new Call of, or a new Cthulhu movie coming out that stars
7456920	7457920	Tori Spelling.
7457920	7463520	Unfortunately not as Cthulhu, but, you know.
7463520	7464520	And she has a small part.
7464520	7467040	Oh, okay, so she's just a cameo.
7467040	7468040	Maybe she dies really well.
7468040	7469040	Anyway.
7469040	7472040	Maybe she's a Cthulhu, I don't know.
7472040	7473040	Cthulhu.
7473040	7482480	Anyway, Uber email, really long, and this comes from GS191.
7482480	7485480	And it's really long.
7485480	7487320	Read the first two paragraphs or something.
7487320	7489080	Um, well, it's really long.
7489080	7493280	Um, hello there, it's been a while since I've written anything to you all.
7493280	7496640	Nevertheless, I am still an avid listener of the show, even though I haven't been able
7496640	7498560	to be in the chat room in quite a while.
7498560	7502000	You can blame my World of Warcraft guild and them pushing me to level my Gnome Mage to
7502000	7504720	70 so they can get another crowd controller in the group.
7504720	7505720	Go figure.
7505720	7511280	Anyway, after sitting through all the big three E3 press conferences, piss conferences,
7511280	7514280	I do have some choice words about all of them.
7514280	7518880	By the way, I have to give many grats to G4 for showing all of the E3 press conferences
7518880	7521040	for the big three with no commercials.
7521040	7527160	I must say, it was quite nice to see them on a 50 inch plasma TV, but standard definition
7527160	7528400	for the lose.
7528400	7530400	To be honest, it would be better just to stream them.
7530400	7535680	I heard that they cut away for the Final Fantasy 13 announcement to show the audience, instead
7535680	7539760	of, you know, viewing the wonderful trailer for Final Fantasy 13.
7539760	7542640	They actually had to, because there was a little thing that came up on the screen, I
7542640	7545440	don't know if you saw it, it got leaked out somewhere, there was a little thing on the
7545440	7548340	screen that said, please do not videotape the following trailer.
7548340	7549340	So I think they had to.
7549340	7550340	You may not...
7550340	7551600	Yep, there is video footage of it.
7551600	7555520	That was, well that was Square's thing, not G4's probably.
7555520	7565880	Well, just in general, from what I'm seeing about the Microsoft one, is that, I guess
7565880	7571720	he seems pretty happy about Fallout 3, Fable 2, Gears of War 2, Resident Evil 5, saying
7571720	7575920	that they did a good job showing it and being excited about Final Fantasy 13.
7575920	7583880	I'm actually going to post this email also in our forum, so I'll put a link to it in
7583880	7584920	the chatroom later on.
7584920	7589240	But it's a fairly lengthy email, but I think it makes some very, very good points.
7589240	7596200	And of course, Sony's having their demo of Resistance 2 and LittleBigPlanet demo and
7596200	7597200	that type of stuff.
7597200	7604520	So I'm going to be actually posting this in its entirety on the forum, so, in a minute.
7604520	7605520	Awesome.
7605520	7606520	It is really long.
7606520	7611440	Hey, Ossofer's building on the idea, you want to hear the, now this could be for the Pyramid
7611440	7613120	Head Carnival, okay?
7613120	7618800	Opening events for the Pyramid Head Appreciation Day, Spin the Pyramid, Silent Hillopoly, Sorry,
7618800	7623600	You Got Raped, and Twisted Pyramid, Twister but in more compromised positions.
7623600	7626880	I do, though, have to read the closure to his letter.
7626880	7627880	What's that?
7627880	7632040	It's from MichaelGS191, this email is brought to you by the never-ending disappointment
7632040	7635460	that is Nintendo, where's my fucking Star Fox remake for the Wii?
7635460	7638920	Or F-Zero, get in line.
7638920	7641820	Well, continuing on, shall I?
7641820	7642820	You shall.
7642820	7645160	Another email adventures.
7645160	7646680	This is actually from Sauce.
7646680	7649440	Hey guys, gals, and ferrets.
7649440	7652080	Wait, wait, wait, where's the ferret?
7652080	7653080	The question, where's the ferret?
7653080	7655400	You had the ferret earlier, you were- The ferret was snuggling in my boobs.
7655400	7656400	I see.
7656400	7658800	Is that how you lost it?
7658800	7661760	No, I was actually sitting on it.
7661760	7666040	I come bearing another video game review to add to the OLR collection, this time the game
7666040	7668680	of choice's God of War, Chains of Olympus.
7668680	7672400	I'm including a link to the review for the chat room's reading pleasure, which I will
7672400	7674320	link in the chat room momentarily.
7674320	7678360	The short version of the review is that Chains of Olympus is a fun, non-stop, action-packed
7678360	7683260	game worth playing for any God of War fan, or any fan of hack and slash violence.
7683260	7686120	It has excellent graphics and sound, and is definitely worth the play.
7686120	7691480	Anyone interested in keeping up with my video game reviews or articles about comics and
7691480	7695960	movies, as are the three industries, are very much tied into one another, can follow me
7695960	7700580	on Twitter, under Marin Marvel, for updates.
7700580	7704400	Keep up the good job, OLR, maybe someday Skye and I will rock the boat and you'll see the
7704400	7706760	reviews on the OLR website, winky face.
7706760	7707760	Someday.
7707760	7708760	Sincerely, Marin.
7708760	7711240	I'm gonna link it in the chat room in just a sec.
7711240	7713480	Yes, I need to read it still.
7713480	7714480	I'm kind of curious.
7714480	7718000	I'm curious to hear what she thinks of it, because I don't know if she's a huge God of
7718000	7721120	War fan, so I'm kind of curious what she thinks of the PSP one.
7721120	7722840	So we'll see.
7722840	7726000	The chat room has now been officially linked.
7726000	7727580	Dun dun dun.
7727580	7729520	So last email.
7729520	7730520	Which came very last minute.
7730520	7735560	Also, Rob2b sent me other emails, but I'm going to save those for being related to last
7735560	7736560	minute story stuff.
7736560	7738120	They're pretty cool things.
7738120	7739600	Hey, OLR.
7739600	7741960	I got the orange box for PS3 a couple of days ago.
7741960	7744600	I can't believe I waited so long for such a great game.
7744600	7747540	Even though I haven't played the original Half-Life, the story is still pretty easy
7747540	7748540	to follow.
7748540	7749540	Excuse me.
7749540	7753560	And it's kind of fun to guess what happened before, plus it looks amazing.
7753560	7757920	Portal also made me smile at the sly remarks, but I have to say, playing the Flash game
7757920	7761680	first makes the first bunch of levels much easier.
7761680	7763920	If anyone hasn't picked it up yet, do so immediately.
7763920	7770200	Preferably not now, but maybe tomorrow during AGI, since you won't miss the whole show.
7770200	7774360	Miss a whole lot in the 20 minutes it takes to get it.
7774360	7779360	I'm listening to this show right now, and I hope that- let me start over- I hope I can
7779360	7781000	get Skype to work this time.
7781000	7782800	Anyway, I look forward to the show.
7782800	7783880	Thanks for reading this email.
7783880	7788040	If you don't read this email, then I guess there's no point in me thanking you, so if
7788040	7790120	you don't, no thanks.
7790120	7792500	Sincerely, pkgr92.
7792500	7796160	This email is sponsored by everything and everyone else not yet mentioned, so now if
7796160	7800280	you sign your emails, you'll be pirating my right to beat that.
7800280	7802760	Alrighty then.
7802760	7803760	It's dot com.
7803760	7805760	Is that it?
7805760	7806760	Yes.
7806760	7808560	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
7808560	7810320	Email us some stuff.
7810320	7813460	Try to not make it so epic though, because then we'd have- you know, we don't have time
7813460	7815320	to read it on air, so we have to post it in the forums.
7815320	7818920	Not that that's a bad thing, but you know, keep it concise.
7818920	7823040	We like concise emails.
7823040	7825600	Moving on with some gaming news, right Logie?
7825600	7826600	Yes.
7826600	7828200	Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
7828200	7833500	There's been some more details unveiled about the game, including that it will have 20 plus
7833500	7836880	characters and download content as well.
7836880	7842920	Of course, they didn't really say too much else other than they were going to be kind
7842920	7846880	of splitting up the roster with, you know, DC and Mortal Kombat characters.
7846880	7853040	There's also fatalities or brutalities, I guess, for the villains that are going to
7853040	7854680	be in it.
7854680	7859360	So if you're playing as DC villains, you can kill people, but the DC heroes will not be
7859360	7860360	able to kill people.
7860360	7863200	They'll just only maim.
7863200	7864200	I think.
7864200	7865200	No.
7865200	7866320	It depends which Batman we're getting.
7866320	7868080	Adam West's Batman never really killed anyone.
7868080	7869320	Wonder Woman killed someone.
7869320	7871080	With their bare hands.
7871080	7875440	Actually, I do believe that Adam West should be in this game.
7875440	7878000	That would sell it for me, but.
7878000	7879560	Oh well.
7879560	7881240	Adam West's Batman should totally be in this game.
7881240	7884200	Either way, I can expect this game in November.
7884200	7885360	Cool.
7885360	7892240	Well, Harmonix has given us a few details, this E3, about the Rock Band 1 compatibility
7892240	7893520	in Rock Band 2.
7893520	7897960	Of course, Rock Band 2 is a game that caught a lot of people's attention at E3 this year,
7897960	7900960	and it's already kind of sneaking out there.
7900960	7904160	They showed the game at some side parties that were held and things, which sounds kind
7904160	7905160	of cool.
7905160	7907280	And one of the rumors out there was that you were going to be able to have all your Rock
7907280	7912960	Band 1 tracks in Rock Band 2, and it turns out, true statement.
7912960	7918760	Apparently what happens is that you're not going to be able to transfer all the songs,
7918760	7921520	because apparently there's some licensing things going on.
7921520	7925360	They basically have to re-license every song in Rock Band 1 for Rock Band 2.
7925360	7929960	They are saying, though, it's only supposed to be a couple songs that don't come over.
7929960	7935080	And some people are thinking perhaps the Aerosmith song can't come over because of the whole
7935080	7937880	fact that Guitar Hero owns their soul now.
7937880	7941000	But hopefully only a couple songs miss the boat.
7941000	7945080	Apparently though, you are going to have to pay a small fee, maybe like a $5 fee, to transfer
7945080	7946080	the songs over.
7946080	7950880	But I still think it's kind of neat, because man, if you add 60 songs from Rock Band 1
7950880	7955380	or however many they end up having, and then your download tracks and the Rock Band 2,
7955380	7957560	that's a lot of freaking songs.
7957560	7961640	Seriously, a lot of freaking songs.
7961640	7965160	So there you have it.
7965160	7970200	Rock Band 2 songs and Rock Band 1 songs together in one roof.
7970200	7971200	Amazing.
7971200	7972720	That's how they should be doing it.
7972720	7978840	Well, in other news, there is a date out for Play TV, something that's going to record
7978840	7982300	your TV shows while you're gaming.
7982300	7988720	It's coming out in Europe from September to December, the first release date being the
7988720	7991080	10th of September for the UK.
7991080	7997760	It's a DVR that adds on to the PlayStation 3, so you can use it while you're playing
7997760	8003280	something that you just happen to really be into to record whatever show that happens
8003280	8010040	to be coming on while you're busy killing people in your game.
8010040	8015840	Kudos for them for making an add-on for the PS3, but isn't that just a VCR?
8015840	8016840	I mean...
8016840	8017840	It's TiVo.
8017840	8020820	But you can still record, I mean, if you're playing a video game, you can still record
8020820	8025140	stuff on your TV, you just have it record off of a different channel.
8025140	8029120	It's just like, remember how with the old VCR, you could watch one show while you're
8029120	8030120	recording another?
8030120	8031120	I don't know.
8031120	8032120	It's just...
8032120	8033120	Well, hey.
8033120	8034120	It's TiVo.
8034120	8036320	If it fills your need, I guess, you know.
8036320	8043160	We've also got release dates for Australia and New Zealand around February or January.
8043160	8044160	So...
8044160	8045160	Okay.
8045160	8046160	Anyways...
8046160	8049360	We're having fun network issues in-house again.
8049360	8050360	Fun fun!
8050360	8053680	Live listeners are noticing that Justin TV went down again, and I think we're just gonna
8053680	8055440	pull the plug on that for the night.
8055440	8056440	Bye-bye.
8056440	8061600	Sorry, but we don't know how else to fix our network issues, and usually JTV is the first
8061600	8062600	thing that has to go.
8062600	8063600	Sorry.
8063600	8064600	Because really, do you really want to watch people just talking?
8064600	8065600	I know.
8065600	8070760	I guess people like Justin TV because there's not as much lag, and that they can hear the
8070760	8073840	things that go on during the break time, and that...
8073840	8076480	I guess the sound's better, but I don't believe that.
8076480	8078760	The sound's crystal clear on all games, so I don't get that.
8078760	8081080	Well, my network just came back up, so...
8081080	8082080	Yeah.
8082080	8083080	So, just kill Justin TV for the night.
8083080	8084080	Sorry, guys.
8084080	8085080	Alrighty.
8085080	8090000	Now it's fun naked time, so, haha, you missed out, Justin TV.
8090000	8093680	Anyways, I'm taking my pants off right now.
8093680	8097480	First, going wild!
8097480	8104800	So Guitar Hero On Tour, surprise, is getting a sequel called On Tour Decades.
8104800	8111040	And I guess the first game sold just over a third of a million, with 350,000 units sold
8111040	8118640	in three weeks, and the sequel, no word on exactly when it's coming out.
8118640	8122820	There is rumors, though, that there might be some form of microphone functionality,
8122820	8126000	maybe karaoke.
8126000	8127160	I don't know.
8127160	8130440	No word, though, when it's coming out, so...
8130440	8134320	Big surprise, a DS sequel, or a sequel for a Guitar Hero game.
8134320	8138780	I mean, hey, they wouldn't want to leave, you know, the DS out with 50 billion releases
8138780	8139780	each year.
8139780	8140780	Who knew?
8140780	8141780	Never.
8141780	8145800	Alright, well, one more story for you guys, and then we're gonna open up the Skype line
8145800	8152080	for you guys, a 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, and, look, we
8152080	8156040	saved the best E3 announcement for last.
8156040	8157040	Here's the thing.
8157040	8162320	A new game was announced by Ubisoft at E3, and the game, Jamie, you're gonna be very
8162320	8163360	excited about this game.
8163360	8166680	You know what, all those network woes, you're not even gonna think about that because you're
8166680	8168560	gonna be so excited about this game.
8168560	8171960	It's called Baby's Party.
8171960	8177240	It's basically Imagine Baby's the party game.
8177240	8182240	It's coming out this autumn, and apparently you actually use the balance board in the
8182240	8183240	game.
8183240	8187880	You actually play this at a babysitting academy, and there's 30 minigames in the game.
8187880	8193620	It's head-to-head, co-op mode, both games, or both methods are available, and it's based
8193620	8196600	on the typical day of a baby.
8196600	8197600	I don't...
8197600	8198600	What?
8198600	8199600	Eat, sleep, poop, cry?
8199600	8203880	I know, I can't think of 30 things that a baby actually does in a day, but there you
8203880	8204880	have it.
8204880	8205880	What was the old...
8205880	8206880	Baby fart?
8206880	8207880	Can they blow up?
8207880	8211720	No, the babies can't even really fart by themselves, like the burping...
8211720	8215800	They can burp, they just need help.
8215800	8219600	What was the game they used to have at Milpitas Golf Land, with the big buttons that was like
8219600	8220920	the babies racing?
8220920	8226560	Oh, they had that at the game, the convention too.
8226560	8227560	It was...
8227560	8228560	The hell was that?
8228560	8229560	Bye Bye Baby...
8229560	8230560	No.
8230560	8231560	Bye Bye Baby something?
8231560	8232960	Yeah, it was some like baby racing game.
8232960	8234960	Come on baby, says AJ Mixx.
8234960	8235960	Come on baby, yeah.
8235960	8236960	Here you go.
8236960	8237960	That game was awesome.
8237960	8242680	If you want to give us a call and talk about how you can't wait for Imagine Baby's the
8242680	8249840	party game, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, I just like
8249840	8257000	the reaffirmation we got from our chat room with Josie16 saying, they sure can poop, as
8257000	8258000	if we didn't know.
8258000	8261240	Thanks for the clarification, appreciate that.
8261240	8266400	AnimeSatsuma in chat says, I can't wait for the breastfeeding minigame.
8266400	8267400	Me neither.
8267400	8271360	Anyhow, we've got a caller on Skype, hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8271360	8274120	Hi, this is Gia68.
8274120	8276120	Hi Gia68, how are you?
8276120	8277120	Alright.
8277120	8282120	Hey, you got to go to California Extreme and you met Jamie live and in person, right?
8282120	8283120	Yep.
8283120	8287080	Now, I've asked you this because I've always wondered this myself, what's Jamie like in
8287080	8290880	real life off the air?
8290880	8296080	Last time, I kind of didn't recognize her at first, because last time I saw her was
8296080	8300520	at Fanta Mae and she had, I think, magenta-ish hair, I don't remember.
8300520	8310200	Yeah, my hair was black in front and red in back, but this time my hair was all black.
8310200	8318640	Also Jamie, when you're speaking in person, you sound a little younger than you do right
8318640	8319640	now on the air.
8319640	8320640	Okay.
8320640	8321640	Okay.
8321640	8322640	I think the radio makes our voices base-ier.
8322640	8323640	Yeah.
8323640	8324640	It just, yeah.
8324640	8327640	Well, didn't Travis say I used to sound like a hyperactive 13-year-old?
8327640	8330200	Yes, but then you went through puberty.
8330200	8331200	That was many years ago.
8331200	8334200	You just dab-robbed with a face.
8334200	8335200	Microphones.
8335200	8338920	Alright, look, in all seriousness, how was, how was California Extreme?
8338920	8342000	It was pretty cool.
8342000	8346800	Alright then, what games did you enjoy playing, like, were there some classic games you'd
8346800	8351720	not really paid respect to before that caught your eyes?
8351720	8356560	Let's see, there were a bunch of, most of the games I played were games that I already
8356560	8363960	played or, and I was familiar with, or I hadn't played in a while, like, the old Star Wars
8363960	8369520	arcade game or Tron, at least the games I hadn't really played before, like, Tailgunner
8369520	8371520	and Looping.
8371520	8375480	Dude, they had the old Star Wars game there.
8375480	8376480	That game was awesome.
8376480	8379680	I got it for sale on top of it, the sit-down cabinet.
8379680	8381760	They had like three of those machines there.
8381760	8384720	I could fit a Star Wars cabinet in here, how much they want for it?
8384720	8386720	I want to say, what, was it 500?
8386720	8388480	Wow, was it in decent shape?
8388480	8390800	Fairly, I didn't play it, I played Cinestar though.
8390800	8394840	Oh my god, I want to sit down Cinestar.
8394840	8398240	Dude, I want an arcade machine in my garage, wouldn't that be awesome?
8398240	8399240	Rob!
8399240	8400240	What?
8400240	8401240	Build a maim.
8401240	8403480	But I want like a, I want a real one.
8403480	8404720	It's real!
8404720	8405720	You can touch it!
8405720	8406720	Alright, alright.
8406720	8407720	We'll see, we'll see.
8407720	8409520	If you set it on fire, it'll burn.
8409520	8410520	We'll see.
8410520	8412840	I don't think my roommate would like that idea very much.
8412840	8414160	I know my wife didn't.
8414160	8418640	Yeah, except I'm not married to the roommate, it's more of a business arrangement, it's
8418640	8419640	a little different.
8419640	8420640	Anyhow, I'm sorry.
8420640	8423200	I like to think of my marriage that way too.
8423200	8425800	Originally, that's all marriage was, was a business agreement.
8425800	8429160	Look, GS68, is there anything, we're getting on tangents, is there anything else you want
8429160	8431160	to add about your wonderful weekend?
8431160	8438960	Um, yeah, I, mostly I was playing The Grid, which is like this third-person shooter.
8438960	8441200	I know The Grid, The Grid is awesome!
8441200	8447640	Yeah, and Rush 2049, which was that racing game of horror that before Wonka and Maxie.
8447640	8450360	Did they ever bring The Grid out on home consoles?
8450360	8452240	I think it's on regular Playstation, isn't it?
8452240	8453400	No, I don't think it is.
8453400	8455400	Wow, that's kind of weird.
8455400	8456400	Interesting.
8456400	8460440	Alright, well, GS68, any quick final thoughts for our listeners before we take another call?
8460440	8464240	Nintendo did not address resource space at E3.
8464240	8465880	Epic fucking fail.
8465880	8466880	Agreed.
8466880	8469440	I'm very disappointed they didn't address it.
8469440	8474840	I hold out hope that maybe since folks at Nintendo feel that this is not where they're
8474840	8479400	going to be addressing the hardcore gamers anymore, my hopes are at PAX, our questions
8479400	8483120	will be answered because I can't think of what other show is for the hardcore gamers
8483120	8485400	except maybe Tokyo Game Show.
8485400	8488520	Thank you for stealing my words, Tokyo Game Show would be the other one.
8488520	8492320	Yeah, they don't display at Tokyo Game Show though, normally Nintendo's not there.
8492320	8493320	Yeah, but they do something concurrent.
8493320	8494520	They do their Nintendo World crap.
8494520	8496640	Yeah, they do that thing concurrently.
8496640	8500120	It's pretty much the same thing.
8500120	8504760	On all our endgame fads, I haven't my sake estimated since I'm not removing it until
8504760	8508880	Nintendo addresses resource space.
8508880	8510600	I think it's very unfortunate they didn't.
8510600	8517040	I mean, that little speaker system is kind of whatever, just roll out a freaking patch
8517040	8518920	that supports the SD cards.
8518920	8521360	Do it overnight while we're sleeping, you know?
8521360	8522360	Just do it.
8522360	8523360	Yeah, whatever happens.
8523360	8529640	I mean, PS2 did it, the original Xbox did it, why can't a console that's one generation
8529640	8530640	ahead?
8530640	8533520	Oh, but it's the new generation, not the next generation.
8533520	8537400	But you have to understand, they announced stuff that's been out on other systems forever
8537400	8540680	and act like it's the new, newest thing ever.
8540680	8545920	Like, oh my god, it's voice chat over the internet, and woo, this has never been done
8545920	8547240	a billion times before.
8547240	8548840	Oh, but wait, it's different.
8548840	8553240	It's a community voice chat because it's a giant, you know, microphone thing instead
8553240	8558640	of headsets because we couldn't figure out how to do headsets, so we made a big USB microphone,
8558640	8559640	surprise.
8559640	8564640	You know, I wish I could use my own USB microphone on that because, to be honest, I don't know.
8564640	8567960	I don't want to have to, I don't want to buy anything.
8567960	8571040	Alright, just to see, we gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.
8571040	8572320	Have a good one, buddy.
8572320	8573320	See ya.
8573320	8576560	This is Golden7GameOLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8576560	8579240	If you want to give us a call, we are standing by.
8579240	8580240	Operators are standing by.
8580240	8585100	I don't think we're going to do too many calls tonight because thanks to all of our frickin'
8585100	8589200	network issues we've been having, among other things, it's kind of put us a little behind
8589200	8592600	on time, so I think we're going to get out of here a decent hour tonight, so we'll see
8592600	8593600	what happens.
8593600	8594600	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
8594600	8595600	Who's this?
8595600	8596600	Hi, this is Gold Banjo.
8596600	8599920	Hey, Gold Banjo, what's on your mind, buddy?
8599920	8603960	I'm really pissed that they didn't have the F-Zero Wii and Star Fox Wii.
8603960	8604960	Amen to F-Zero.
8604960	8606760	Yeah, Star Fox Wii I'm okay with.
8606760	8611120	Star Fox seems to be the game that comes out really late in the, uh, because I just remember
8611120	8614920	that Star Fox GameCube thing, that adventures or whatever the hell that thing was, that
8614920	8615920	didn't come out until-
8615920	8616920	I never got around to that.
8616920	8617920	That, well, you didn't miss much.
8617920	8620440	It didn't come out until really late in the GameCube cycle.
8620440	8625240	Star Fox will be the thing that we get a couple years down the road, but F-Zero, man, maybe
8625240	8629880	it's just because Mario Kart is still out there, so they want Mario Kart to be the racing
8629880	8633600	thing for a little while, but I really hope that next year's E3 we get something about
8633600	8634600	F-Zero.
8634600	8636600	Yeah, me too.
8636600	8640880	We'll see, but I'm just, you know, I'm a big F-Zero fan, you know, what can I say?
8640880	8644440	I wouldn't mind watching somebody else kind of pick that up, you know, Wipeout's kind
8644440	8645440	of cool.
8645440	8647560	I guess Wipeout's the closest thing I can think of on another system that's kind of
8647560	8651820	like F-Zero, but it's not the same, but I love that futuristic fast racing.
8651820	8654160	That's my favorite, is the future fast.
8654160	8655160	Speed Racer.
8655160	8656160	Really?
8656160	8657160	I'm gonna have to check that out.
8657160	8658240	You should check it out.
8658240	8659240	It's actually pretty cool.
8659240	8660240	Do you own it?
8660240	8661240	Uh, yes.
8661240	8662640	I'm gonna borrow it.
8662640	8663640	You can't borrow it.
8663640	8664640	Oh, okay, I get it.
8664640	8665640	I get it.
8665640	8666640	Funny.
8666640	8668640	All right, what else is on your mind, GoldBander?
8668640	8670640	What else, what do you think of the other stuff?
8670640	8679320	Well, this week I finally, I'm actually starting to get into some PC gaming, I was playing
8679320	8685360	a bunch of the Source Engine games from Steam and stuff, Valve, like Half-Life, Portal,
8685360	8691600	and I was having some fun with that, I guess, so that was a blast.
8691600	8695600	There's some fun stuff on Steam, if you haven't seen it yet, check out Audiosurf, I like that
8695600	8696600	one on Steam.
8696600	8701360	I played the demo and I really liked it, I'm thinking about it.
8701360	8704640	I wish there was some more multiplayer type stuff you could do in there, but it's still
8704640	8705640	fun.
8705640	8711320	It reminds me of Klax on speed, that's what I love, I used to love Klax back in the day.
8711320	8718520	I got my butt with the first online journey onto the online thing, there's always going
8718520	8726960	to be that, the little kid that likes to swear and be rude, and the kid's like speaking some
8726960	8734000	other language and stuff, and then once we start to try and vote ban him, then he apologizes
8734000	8740560	and speaks English, so I'm like, now you can speak English, and it just got me so mad and
8740560	8746000	stuff, and then he's like swearing not to ban him, we just ban him, no questions, no
8746000	8747000	further things.
8747000	8748000	Good for you.
8748000	8753080	I have a zero tolerance policy for idiots on those things, and on Xbox Live I warn them
8753080	8756920	every time, I do the little feedback thing every time.
8756920	8761320	I'm a little jerk on Xbox Live, I'm a tattletale, but you know what?
8761320	8763040	Somebody's got to do it.
8763040	8765120	Exactly.
8765120	8766120	It's just annoying.
8766120	8769600	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Go Banjo?
8769600	8777680	Let me think, I don't know, you three could have been better, but I am excited for Banjo
8777680	8783720	Kazooie 3, I don't care what anybody else says, I'm a hardcore Banjo Kazooie fan.
8783720	8786880	We haven't had a lot of Banjo Kazooie love on the show tonight, so there you have it.
8786880	8790960	Go Banjo, adding a little bit of Banjo Kazooie love, so it's not just a clever name, Banjo
8790960	8791960	Kazooie.
8791960	8794080	Alright, have a good night, my friend, take care.
8794080	8795080	Okay, later.
8795080	8800240	I was going to say too, real quick, if you are interested in a game that's sort of like
8800240	8804280	F-Zero, try the Speed Racer Wii game.
8804280	8807640	It just dropped in price, it's only $29.99 now, and you probably can get it used for
8807640	8808640	even cheaper.
8808640	8810720	I still need to play the pinball game I got on Wii.
8810720	8813520	I've played a little bit of it, and it's fun, I need to play more of it, because pinball
8813520	8815720	is awesome, right, Jamie?
8815720	8817160	Yes, it is.
8817160	8821320	Or if you don't own a Wii, you can get it on the PS2 coming in September.
8821320	8824760	Aw, Shaoran in chat called me a fucking narc.
8824760	8826880	The narc was an awesome game, so shut up.
8826880	8832120	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
8832120	8833400	Bow down to Pyramid Head.
8833400	8834720	No, this is Osprey.
8834720	8836720	Hey, what's up, Osprey?
8836720	8839000	That'd be cool if Pyramid Head did call us.
8839000	8843640	I feel like I'm the only one that was kind of excited for a new Zelda game to be announced,
8843640	8846920	and it was never announced, so I'm sad.
8846920	8851320	I didn't have my hopes up for it, it did seem a little bit soon in the Zelda cycle.
8851320	8853000	Next year, definitely.
8853000	8854400	Next year, definitely, definitely.
8854400	8856000	This year, not so much.
8856000	8859280	Didn't we just get a DS game not that long ago?
8859280	8861720	The whole little Wind Waker looking thing?
8861720	8862720	That was just last year, right?
8862720	8863720	Yeah.
8863720	8864720	It was a fan of my hourglass.
8864720	8867720	It was, I don't know, it was okay.
8867720	8871520	You have to remember, Nintendo's developing for two major platforms now, it's not just
8871520	8876480	about the Wii, it's about the DS as well, so you know, they're a little split there,
8876480	8883240	but I think you'll see a new Zelda, you know, Uber-type looking game next year, probably.
8883240	8888440	I was more surprised, that Kid Icarus thing, with all the evidence that supported its existence,
8888440	8890720	I'm very surprised that it didn't show up.
8890720	8891720	Very surprised.
8891720	8896800	Well, you know that they're just trying to appeal to the casual gamer now, so I guess
8896800	8900280	we're not even going to hear about that at E3 anymore.
8900280	8901280	Maybe E for All?
8901280	8904080	I don't know, isn't E for All supposed to have the big three this year?
8904080	8907240	E for All usually has them all, but they don't make any announcements there.
8907240	8911960	If anything, it's going to be around Tokyo Game Show, or whatever their game world thing
8911960	8912960	is.
8912960	8916320	I think they still have time to announce some more titles for, because really they only
8916320	8923440	have Animal Crossing, which I think, I thought that was November 7th-ish, it might actually
8923440	8928400	be in October, it's around October, November, and then that's pretty much it for the holiday.
8928400	8932840	I mean, that's all they've announced so far for Wii, so that's their one title.
8932840	8935860	They have room for some more titles to get slipped in there, because usually they have
8935860	8937760	a title coming out each month.
8937760	8942800	Last year was Donkey Kong Barrel Blast for September.
8942800	8946640	There was Battalion Wars 2 for October.
8946640	8953800	And then for November was, of course, the Wii Zapper and Super Mario Galaxy.
8953800	8959180	I don't think there was anything for December, January was something.
8959180	8962400	But they have room to announce some more games in there, and I don't think they're going
8962400	8967680	to have one game for the holiday, unless they manage to get the Wii Sports Resort thing
8967680	8968680	out.
8968680	8972280	So, I expect some more announcements.
8972280	8977160	So some hopefulness from Loki that makes sense, makes sense to me, he's right, there's got
8977160	8979640	to be more than one game coming out this Christmas.
8979640	8985400	Alright, any other thoughts, Osfer?
8985400	8989920	I'm kind of concerned about the future for DDR, seeing as that they want to add mines
8989920	8993960	or shock arrows, as they call it, into it.
8993960	8998400	At least they're trying something new for them, but you're right, I don't think it's
8998400	9002840	going to give the game the swift kick in the pants it needs, but it's something I guess
9002840	9004280	to hold people over.
9004280	9009240	Well, I don't want DDR to turn into ITG, because that's like one of the main reasons I hate
9009240	9010240	in the group.
9010240	9013960	It's because I hate mines, like, you play the game to step on the arrows, not to freaking
9013960	9014960	dodge them.
9014960	9015960	It's just irritating.
9015960	9019320	If, hey, as long as they have maybe, you know, you can turn freeze arrows off, so I'm sure
9019320	9023660	you can turn those things off too, but I get what you mean, you kind of hope that they
9023660	9026320	don't whore it out, you know what I mean?
9026320	9031480	Yeah, and also, even if you can turn it off, like in the group, it kicks you from being
9031480	9036200	able to rank in any of the songs, so, I don't know.
9036200	9037200	Interesting.
9037200	9038200	Well, we'll see.
9038200	9041800	I am curious about that new machine, though, when everyone comes to our neighborhood.
9041800	9044040	Hopefully it doesn't get broken by little kids first, we'll see.
9044040	9049200	I forgot to mention, I played Guitar Freaks V4 this week.
9049200	9052160	I have to say I'm very unimpressed by it.
9052160	9056800	It's just, I don't know, the whole interface and everything looks like a really shoddy
9056800	9063600	PlayStation 2 game, which, actually, I think the releases of Guitar Freaks are on PlayStation
9063600	9067120	2, so I guess that makes sense, but no innovation whatsoever.
9067120	9071920	Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, we're gonna wrap up the show, but have a good
9071920	9072920	one, okay?
9072920	9077120	Alright, see ya, I'm calling for the night.
9077120	9078120	Later.
9078120	9080800	Alright, we're gonna close the Skyplane for now.
9080800	9084880	If you didn't get through, I'm so sorry, but you can always leave us a voicemail, or, and
9084880	9087700	I gotta catch up on voicemails, probably next week we'll do that, or you can always send
9087700	9090840	us an email, mailbagorangeonstrader.com, let's do some last-minute stories.
9090840	9092240	Jamie, you said you had a couple.
9092240	9096240	Uh, actually, I do, and one of them, because I couldn't get the email pulled back up, I
9096240	9101720	found it from another site, but this one was given to me by Rob2Bees.
9101720	9109640	Time Hollow, which is a Konami game for the DS, is to be localized and released in August.
9109640	9113880	It's actually, the neat thing about the game is that you get this thing called a time pen,
9113880	9118440	which is your stylus, that you use to manipulate time to solve puzzles within the game.
9118440	9125080	It's very, uh, almost sort of, uh, Phoenix Wright-ish, in terms of how, uh, how it feels
9125080	9130040	or how it plays, but you can check, uh, either the, um, the Japanese website for it, which
9130040	9136960	is, uh, konami.jp slash time underscore hollow, or, um, I'm sure you can find stuff on YouTube.
9136960	9141600	And the other thing that's, um, I know a few other, uh, anime fans would be excited about
9141600	9147600	this is that Sega grabbed the license for, um, the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, um,
9147600	9154160	for Nintendo DS, um, actually several of the, the DS games, um, from, uh, Namco Bandai and
9154160	9160440	Sega's like, um, okay, we want, so, um, you might see those eventually, and you can also
9160440	9162720	get the, the little happy dance that she does.
9162720	9168640	I want the PlayStation 2 one, because in the PlayStation 2 one, she apparently makes her
9168640	9171200	own RPG, and then you get to play it.
9171200	9172200	Cool.
9172200	9173200	So.
9173200	9174200	Very cool.
9174200	9175200	Okay.
9175200	9176200	Loki, anything?
9176200	9181320	Of course I have stuff, I have a long laundry list of stuff.
9181320	9183320	Make it quick, we want to go home.
9183320	9188420	Um, anyways, Ubisoft announced a game called I Am Alive, it's like a survival game, looks
9188420	9195040	pretty cool, coming out Spring 2009, and, uh, yeah, I have an awesome trailer for that.
9195040	9199400	Rock Band 2, they announced the full track list for the game, which is pretty awesome,
9199400	9205960	including, uh, there's ACDC, AFI, Las Morcet, um, Alice in Chains, Bad Company, Beastie
9205960	9211240	Boys, Billy Idol, um, there is Journey, uh, any way you want it.
9211240	9213720	Pretty much one of those rumored lists came true, it seems like.
9213720	9215840	Yes, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, et cetera, et cetera.
9215840	9216840	Fleetwood Mac, awesome.
9216840	9222640	Um, but there is 84 songs that they detailed, and I hear there's going to be 20 more tracks
9222640	9226720	as well, but they're going to be free downloads, so, that's kind of cool.
9226720	9227720	That's cool.
9227720	9234880	Um, also, um, there's some stuff, there is a no fail option as well for Rock Band 2,
9234880	9240480	or what I like to call it, Drunk Party Option, so that's pretty cool.
9240480	9248860	And um, some, um, kind of a change of pace here, but apparently, the, um, Rock Band instruments
9248860	9253120	will be compatible with Guitar Hero World Tour.
9253120	9257200	So you'll actually be able to use them, uh, what they're going to do, since Guitar Hero
9257200	9262920	World Tour has, you know, five things you can hit instead of, um, you know, the four,
9262920	9267320	they're going to actually, um, automatically disable one of those when you play that, um,
9267320	9268440	so that's kind of cool.
9268440	9275760	Also, the Xbox 360 version of Guitar Hero Aerosmith, um, is being patched to utilize
9275760	9280960	the Rock Band, um, guitars on the 360, so that's kind of cool as well.
9280960	9283400	Good, good move, thank you.
9283400	9289520	Um, apparently NCAA Football 09 is really broken, uh, there you have a laundry list
9289520	9294640	of stuff that's just not working, including some sliders, like the CPU sliders, and don't
9294640	9301400	do anything, uh, the online dynasty mode's broken, the super sim mode is broken, and
9301400	9306360	the kick returns are also broken, and some other crap, so, way to go EA Sports also,
9306360	9308800	um, I want to say NASCAR 09.
9308800	9311400	The game saves are broken, sweet.
9311400	9319080	Um, one thing that's kind of interesting is, um, apparently Rainbow Six Vegas 2 had, uh,
9319080	9325800	been patched, there was a, um, disk check thing being added into the game, um, but it
9325800	9331760	was a problem for people that got the game via digital download, and so the fix for it,
9331760	9338400	well, apparently Ubisoft used a pirate hack that someone had made to bypass the disk check
9338400	9339400	thing.
9339400	9340400	What?
9340400	9341400	Nice.
9341400	9342400	So they, um, used that to fix it.
9342400	9343400	Huh.
9343400	9344400	Interesting.
9344400	9352520	Um, also, the NPD results for, um, June have come out, and the Wii is now the number one
9352520	9359360	selling system in the US, as well as the world now, so, 10.9 million units with the, um,
9359360	9366160	Xbox 360 trailing behind by just a little bit, so, very interesting.
9366160	9372240	Um, Nintendo Power has announced a, um, new game via their cover here, uh, what we thought
9372240	9378400	may have been Kingdom Hearts 3 is actually Sonic and the Black Knight, um, which is,
9378400	9384920	looks like a role-playing game, maybe a little bit Kingdom Hearts-esque, I don't know, um,
9384920	9388400	there's also rumors that Nintendo might actually be publishing that title, so that's-
9388400	9390200	Sonic and Mario World, that would be awesome.
9390200	9392240	So that'd be kind of interesting there.
9392240	9399920	Um, Miyamoto, um, announced that they're making a Pikmin game, so, that's kind of cool, um,
9399920	9405240	and one other Nintendo game that kind of went under the radar here, Rhythm Heaven is, has
9405240	9411000	been announced for the US, it's actually, um, Rhythm Tengoku Gold is being localized
9411000	9417000	for North America and, of course, is a rhythm music game, uh, Samba de Amigo, uh, Sega has
9417000	9423160	confirmed that it will be getting downloaded, and, um, it's actually going to debut some
9423160	9430680	launch content, um, starting on September, uh, 23rd when the game is launched, and, uh,
9430680	9435200	the first set of downloads will include the 80s, um, radio song, I guess, I Want Candy
9435200	9443160	from, uh, Bow Wow Wow, or Bow Wow Wow Wow, yeah, we get it, too many, uh, Jets, um, Are
9443160	9450440	You Going to Be My Girl, and Lou Bega's Mambo Mambo, and no word if those are paid to unlock,
9450440	9456400	um, content, or if it's actually download content, but interesting, nonetheless, and,
9456400	9464760	um, let's see here, there was a new unlock code for Supernova 2 cabinets that, uh, revealed
9464760	9472200	three more songs, uh, Terra Stars, and, um, let's see, Jet Girl Spins, uh, Mars Wars 3,
9472200	9479600	and Revenge G Alternative with, uh, Reba, Reba Bata, or however you pronounce that,
9479600	9486960	and then, of course, uh, Paranoid Hades, so that's kind of cool, and let's see here, real
9486960	9495680	quick, that's a lot of last minute stories, sorry, sorry, I'm quickly, I'm trying to be
9495680	9501560	quick, um, GPS coming to the PSP within nine months, uh, there are details releasing some
9501560	9508280	Famicom inspired classic controllers, so you can import those if you want them, um, let's
9508280	9513720	see here, well, it was E3 week, so it was a little busy this week, fun little bit of
9513720	9519920	trivia, Animal Crossing, which was being shown off at E3, actually had, of course, none other
9519920	9526000	than Charles Martinet playing the game as well from an undisclosed location with a Mario
9526000	9531200	style avatar, and, uh, he was riffing people in the Mario voice, and was also hitting people
9531200	9535200	with axes and complaining about people that ran over his flowers, I'm thinking undisclosed
9535200	9539400	location means backstage, because, yeah, I don't know if you remember when they showed
9539400	9544360	off the whole, uh, voice chat, or the DS, uh, internet thing, but they had, uh, Charles
9544360	9549000	Martinet in Seattle, right, remember that, uh, and then you would see him, like, an hour
9549000	9554320	later walking around the show floor, yeah, cause he could teleport, um, there is a rumor
9554320	9559000	that someone is working on a PSP emulator for the Wii, and they have screenshots, unfortunately
9559000	9562520	right now it's only running at about seven frames per second, but that's still disturbing
9562520	9566640	nonetheless, Animal Crossing will support USB keyboards, so you can actually type your
9566640	9571120	messages to people without having to use the Wii remote, because that sucked, uh, Gears
9571120	9575520	of War 2 is coming out November 7th this year, so people are probably excited about that,
9575520	9580480	uh, LittleBigPlanet is going to allow you to charge users for your content that you
9580480	9586920	created, oh god, so you can make money off that shit, um, there's apparently some shocking
9586920	9596280	announcement coming to, um, the DKS3713, um, event put out by Square Enix, something related
9596280	9604160	to Final Fantasy VII, uh oh, uh, Rock Band 2 is going to be, the release of this is really
9604160	9610480	strange, um, the game only version for the Xbox 360 is coming out in September, the bundle,
9610480	9615720	as long as, with the PS3 bundle, the PS3 standalone version is coming out in October, and then
9615720	9622240	the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions I think are coming out in November, is that confusing
9622240	9629440	enough, um, and then let's see here, and then my favorite thing, which I'm going to end
9629440	9637000	on here real quick, is that, um, there's a quote taken from, uh, G4, apparently is an
9637000	9642280	interview with Reggie Fils-Aime, who says, how could you feel left out? The Animal Crossing
9642280	9648080	that we've been hearing about that people wanted, uh, fully connected to the internet,
9648080	9652460	go to other people's towns, plus I said Grand Theft Auto on the DS, how do you feel left
9652460	9661700	out with those types of announcements? Well, it's quite easy. There's about 500 other things
9661700	9667280	you didn't address, but maybe it's just me. I'm not a casual gamer, what do I know? Alright,
9667280	9671280	thank you for the, uh, follow-up updates, although quite lengthy, it was E3 week, there's
9671280	9675520	a lot of shit going on, next week I'm sure we'll have a lot of stuff too, as the fallout
9675520	9680720	begins from E3 and we start ramping up towards Christmas, as was said earlier, but for now,
9680720	9685240	we go around and we get everybody's final thought. Loki, your final thought tonight?
9685240	9690000	My final thought is, this is actually kind of funny, there's, um, apparently Dead Rising,
9690000	9694640	the Wii version is being called Dead Rising Zombie Sacrifice in Japan, and I don't know
9694640	9698760	if this is true, but for the US version, I heard that they're calling it Dead Rising
9698760	9707640	Chop Until You Drop. Cheesy. I like that. My final thought is, I kind of want a burrito.
9707640	9715080	Dark Soccer, your final thought? Uh oh, we might have to chop till we drop Dark Soccer,
9715080	9720960	she sounds like she's turning into a zombie. That is a distinct possibility. Alright, um,
9720960	9727240	until then, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting and
9727240	9731120	supporting Orange Launcher. Remember, if you like what you hear, oh, sorry. God damn it.
9731120	9735680	Sorry. Sorry. I am ending this damn show. This is important. No, we want to do the cage
9735680	9741040	match. This is important, real quick. DDRX, they're reviving some of their old, um, licensed
9741040	9744760	songs, including Dubby Dub and Butterfly, and they may have mentioned that last week,
9744760	9750300	but I don't remember. Either way. Dubby Dub's coming back. Do not want. That might make
9750300	9755280	a headache worse, won't it? I've got a very bad headache right now. I'm sorry. Alright,
9755280	9759560	well remember, if you like what you hear, we persevere through the headaches and through
9759560	9763480	the fire and the flames to bring you this program each and every week. Please tell two
9763480	9767560	friends you know about the program. That's how we spread around the world slowly. Hey,
9767560	9770960	we'll see you at PAX in a few weeks. Those of you that are going, all three of us are
9770960	9774240	going to be there, and I can't wait to meet you guys. I don't know if there will be an
9774240	9777840	OLR meetup one night, but I imagine we'll do something. It's going to be a party. It's
9777840	9784080	going to be so much fun. Right, Loki? It's so much fun? I don't know. I've never been
9784080	9789280	to PAX. Alright. Until then, we'll see you guys next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
