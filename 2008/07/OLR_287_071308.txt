Tonight, July 13th, 2008
A major lawsuit happens in the music game world
Mega Man 9 is set to go multi-platform
And we take calls on your predictions for this year's E3
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
And welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that podcast dedicated to video games
Video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
My name is Rob Roberts and join me as always
Say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
Yo
How you doing, Jamie?
Warm
Warm, yeah, it's not quite as horrid, the temperature this week
But we still are combating some issues here in California
Not just the heat, but the smoke was terrible
Like Wednesday or Thursday, oh my gosh
I am making use of Consumer Reports
It was like a volcano erupted, how's that?
To look for air conditioners
Oh, hooray
Another idea I have is an evaporative air cooler
Nice, now we have a little ghetto set up today that's working fairly decent
Because I'm a genius
But thank god it's not 103 like last week
I think this week it's 93, so hot, but not scorching hot
Also hot every week, say hello to the one and only tech master, Loki
Yes, I am, I run very hot
How are you doing?
It looks like you shaved your head almost completely
Yes, because I was hot
And because I didn't want to comb my hair anymore
It gets to the point where it's like, okay, I can't do anything with this
So I'm gonna have to shave it off
Alright, we're about to get into how is your gaming week
But first, just a quick little note about tonight's show
There's no Justin TV tonight because our video camera's out
So we do not have Justin TV feed tonight
Sorry guys, but at least it's a radio show, not a video show
And the other thing is that there's only going to be a part A this week
There's not going to be a part A and part B
That's partially due to the heat, also partially due to the fact that E3
The madness for E3 starts tomorrow
So it kind of defeats the purpose of uploading a show mid-week
Because everything will be outdated
We're going to try and have something up on the feed mid-week
It just depends if we can all get together at once
We'll see, so more to come on that
But for now, we're only going to have one big show for you guys here
But all the segments you know and love
Classic gaming of the week, mailbag, all that good stuff
And your calls
And chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com
And tonight, they're talking about fire
Act Def says the show is on fire
Frisbee says my hair is on fire
There you have it, everybody's on fire
You're all flaming tonight in chat at Orange Lounge Radio
I think I've made a decision
What's that?
What might best suit our needs
The cooler?
A swamp cooler
Excellent, yeah, actually my work
And it's cheaper than a portable air conditioning unit
Alright
Be more cost effective
This is economics on Orange Lounge Radio
Save money, use less energy
Alright, let's talk about all the money you blew games on this week
And how was your gaming week?
I played DDR
Really?
I played the supernova machine at the movie theater
And I wanted to die
I was wearing my sandals
So first of all I didn't have the right shoes
And then I tried to do shit that was way too hard
But at least you got up there and played
Yeah, sorta
I know if I play I am way, way out of practice
So that's my issue
Although I want to try a supernova 2 machine someday
I dusted off my Super Nintendo cartridge
Of something that I will be speaking of later in the show
Awesome
How about now, you are an iPhone user
Yes, I did download some iPhone games
You got the new 2.0 firmware for your existing iPhone, right?
Yes, I did
Okay, gotcha
And let me give the name of the game real quick
I haven't played a whole lot of it
But it's a free game for everyone who has an iPhone or an iPod touch
And it's called Aurora Faint
It basically plays like Bejeweled
But you have a leveling system in it
So it's pretty cool
Like Puzzle Quest-ish, kinda?
Mmm, yeah
I also downloaded the Stalker program
What, pray tell, is the Stalker program?
Whirl
How does that work?
It's like, for everyone who's got it
It keeps track of like restaurants and places you like to go
So that you know where your friends like to hang out
That is kinda scary
What a world we're living in
What do you think, though, about this whole, you know, application thing on the new iPhone?
You know, the fact that people can create their own games and applications and all this stuff
God damn time
You think it's kinda what's gonna put the iPhone really out there, but make it kinda the must-have thing?
Sorta
There's still a lot of people
It was already the must-have thing
There's still a lot of people that are very anti-iPhone
Well, sucks to be them
I think we have one sitting here in the studio
Sucks to be them, more for me
I'm anti-Apple, but that, you know, does fall under the same umbrella
Do you think, though, do you think another company will try to, you know, cause I notice like, what is that other phone?
The Instinct is supposed to work a lot like the iPhone
I can tell you now the LG one is shit
I look at that and I go, it's not gonna really be able to penetrate the marketplace the way that Apple has, I don't think
That's just my personal thought
What's gonna help Apple is marketing to other providers
I'll tell you what else is cool
I was hearing a little bit about it on Bobby's show
I don't know much about this, but apparently there's some type of program you can get
Some app you can get that you can listen to internet radio through that Edge network
So you can listen to All Games Radio or our show anywhere you go
People have it hooked up so that if you have one of those systems where you can play your iPod through the car
You could listen to All Games Radio, like it's a car
I almost downloaded it, but I have to move off my photos before I put more apps on there
The stuff that I downloaded so far, let me grab my phone and take a look real quick
Blah
Live radio, she's literally opening up the phone
I downloaded AIM, Aurora, Thaint, Twitterrific, Whirl, and Epocrates prescription
Because Epocrates is actually kind of a cool little program
That if you have, say that you find an unidentified pill and you want to know what it is
Then you can enter in the pill's description including serial numbers that are on the pill
Wow
And it'll look it up and show you a picture of it so you can compare it
And you know, if I take this, will I hallucinate?
Bobby spoke up in chat, he says it's called Tuner, is the name of the program you're going to want to check out
I think I'll download it right now
Awesome, it might have a cost, I'm not sure
Let's see, comments from chat
Robert M, my iTunes is showing the applications menu in place of games
I have the iPod fifth generation video though
Same thing happened to me, I have Pagle and some of the other games they've released for iPod
And they now are applications that run on your iPod
And sadly they don't have a lot of them, but that's what happened to the old games
I hope they do put out some other useful things for those of us that haven't gotten on board the iPhone thing yet
I think I will at some point, I'm just waiting for the craziness around the iPhone to die down
Gerardo speaks up though and says I don't see anything innovative in my phone and then hides
Okay, I checked out Tuner and Tuner is $5
$4.99 to be specific
Whatever, it's $5
So I'm gonna get it after I have money
I downloaded a bunch of free shit though and it was really cool
Now I can look up drugs at work
And AIM, I can use AIM at work
Free is awesome
Hells yeah
Unless it's yours
Loki, how was your gaming week?
It was full of hamburger
Oh, because I'm eating a hamburger, that's why
Of course
That is not just a hamburger, that is a bacon and cheese I see in there
Double bacon cheeseburger
Oh my god, an artery killer right there
Well it's because, I don't know, fast food hamburgers are pretty tiny
So if you get a hamburger it's like a cracker
Gotcha
So this is two crackers and, I don't know, bacon
By the way Jamie, Bobby is recommending Tap Tap Revenge and says it's free
I saw it and I looked at it but I don't think I would play it that much
Free Jamie, free
Well if it's free then you gotta play it
Like Yaris, you gotta try Yaris at least once
I also though I'm trying to be conservative for space because I really do like to take a lot of useless pictures with my phone
That she does, I can attest to that
We'll go out to Indian Food and she takes pictures of the food
And my beer
She takes pictures of his eating, her beer
Anyway, sorry, Loki, your gaming week
That's right
Grand Theft Auto IV, that was pretty much it
I've been busy and we'll get into that
We'll get into that in a little while
But Grand Theft Auto is still fun, still a lot of people playing it
It's still fun, well I haven't, we've just been playing the work games
You know, so we do our four player deathmatch because the fifth machine is still broken
What makes the replayability of that game so awesome?
Just, well like the new thing that we're doing now is we've changed the settings a little bit
So that the only blip that shows up on the radar is whoever is in first
And everyone else is invisible
So you're running around and whoever is in the lead, you can find them but the other players you can't find
So the person in the lead doesn't see like people like bearing down on them in cars and stuff like that
So it makes it really intense actually because everyone is kind of going after the leader at the same time
Nice
Comments from Chatroom, we have NameAndLights says I'm using Tuner on iTouch
So that's that iPod that's not quite, it's the iPhone without the phone
The iTouch which also got the upgrade to use all the apps
That's pretty cool
Let's see, other comments from Chat
Shaoran said there used to be a double bacon with a really long name that a friend of mine called a Satanburger
I don't know
We're turning into Orange Launch Foodio
Alright, so Grand Theft Auto 4 was Loki's game of the week
Yeah, pretty much
We'll get to the rest of it in a little bit
Myself, I also have not been playing a lot of new stuff, kind of the same old stuff, you know, Raiding and WoW
Guitar Hero 2, I went back and played Guitar Hero 2 this week in Guitar Hero 3
And I think I talked about this a couple of weeks ago
I'm finally learning with my fingers how to hit those notes without necessarily strumming
Like the difference between the notes that you don't have to strum if you get the note before it
I can't remember what exactly they call that, I'm sure somebody in chat will correct me, but the whole
Hammer ons
Is that a hammer ons? Yeah, I'm finally learning how to do that
I don't know that either
Hell, I'm still playing three keys, okay?
Well, I was able to go back to Guitar Hero 2 and 3
I actually beat the Living Color song in Guitar Hero 3
I five started my first cult of personality
I five started my first time on hard, not expert, I'm not quite there yet
But for me, that was a freaking accomplishment
I was so excited because that song was not easy
I was excited when I beat that freaking Slipknot song
That has the impossible introduction, that was tough
You have to learn hammer ons to get past that
I was going to say, I also, this week, it's not gaming related
But I kept, just even watching the trailers for it
And then after watching the movie, I think it would make an awesome game
Wanted
Just because, I mean, you know the whole curving bullets thing in there
The way they kind of like swing their gun out or whatever
You could totally do that with a Wii remote or something
I don't understand why anyone hasn't come up with this idea
To make this movie into a game
Because it would be pretty awesome
But The Matrix was supposed to be an awesome game too
Listen, okay
After watching this movie, you're just like
Why the fuck did this guy not direct The Matrix?
Because, I swear to God, if he directed the sequels
We wouldn't have an issue
There would be like 50 sequels to this damn movie
Because it's seriously so much better
It's the Russian guy who did Nightwatch and Daywatch
I know, I used to hold The Matrix pretty high up there for action
It's borderline, I mean, Keanu Reeves kind of brings it down there
But action-wise it was pretty kick-ass
But, oh my God, Wanted is so much better
Sub-Z in chat says, curved bullet is so unrealistic
But that's the point, right?
It's the point
You don't go in there expecting a realistic espionage film
Exactly, I mean, there's a guy that freakin'
Basically these assassins or whatever
Have the ability to control adrenaline really well
To the point where they can do superhuman things
That's the whole premise of this
It's a superhero film
Sort of, it's not really that superhuman
But Matrix stuff, where they can slow down time
Their perspective of it, super strength and stuff like that
Here's my other quick questions about Wanted
And then we'll go back to games from movies
Are there tits in the movie?
No
No tits?
No tits
Any drug usage?
There's lots of blood, lots of killing
So it's just fine, because I'm looking for the trifecta of sex, drugs, and violence
There's no tits, so you don't have sex
There's no drugs, it sounds like?
There's a good twist in the plot, a good twist
That you don't see coming
It's a twist
What a twist
You can have Nookie without boobs, Rob
Well, I guess that's true
But, you know, still
Do you watch that episode of Buffy?
Look, I'm surprised Angelina Jolie is in a movie and not showing her tits
That's all
Well, you see her entire backside
Okay, so there's a little sex, a little sex
Sexual
Anyway
We have T and A minus T
Just A
Alright
And yeah, it's supposed to be unrealistic, but it's not
It's basically, it's kind of like The Matrix
Where it's sort of grounded in
Okay, I want to say it's really grounded in the real world
But it takes place in a world that could sort of be realistic
And then there's people doing unrealistic things in it
It's sort of like that, but it's not like as ridiculous and ridiculous as
But, I mean, a lot of video games are ridiculous
Like that, right?
You know, they take place in sometimes the real world
Or a world like this one
It's not like you go into it and go
Man, this is completely retarded, like the transporter or something like that
This is, you know
I don't know, it's just really cool stuff
That's all I got to say
Awesome
Definitely go see it, it's awesome
I'd totally watch it again
Back to video games, I want to talk about a new game I played this week
I went out and bought Civilization Revolution
I talked about the demo a few weeks ago on the show
And I was pretty crazy about the demo
I went about the full game, I'm not disappointed
As a Civilization fan on the PC, I am not disappointed
It's not as in-depth as the version on the PC
It's very much simplified
But I think it works great for a console
I mean, I ran through a full game
Granted on the easiest difficulty
Because I'm still trying to get my feet wet with how to play the game again
But it only took me between an hour and an hour and a half
To get a total domination victory over my opponents in the game
The only kind of little bitch I have in the game that I think would get to me
If I was coming from the PC to the console
And I think you've probably heard this a lot of other places and it's true
You don't get to customize your game a lot
Like in Civ 4, you can customize the world you're playing on
And when you start and how the world looks and the size
You can customize all that stuff in advance
In Civ Revolution, you already kind of start with one city built
And that's it, you don't get to customize a whole lot of that
So I'm hoping though maybe with some download stuff later on
2K and Firaxis can remedy that
But it's a minor bitch in the scope of things
Because I think the game is still pretty cool
I'm a little surprised it's not on the arcade
There's not a lot that they're doing in this game
That requires, I would think, the usage of a DVD
I would think it's a game they could have put out on the arcade for a lot cheaper
So I think the price is probably one of the only sticking points
Because $60 is quite a bit
But it is a hell of a game with replayability value
And it's something you can play multiplayer
Although I personally have not done that myself yet
I get on and play multiplayer
I think it's one of those games where it's never quite the same game twice
And there's many different ways to accomplish the goal
Many different civilizations you can play
I do recommend it, especially if you're a fan of it on the PC
And you want to kind of check it out
But just know you're not getting a port of Civ 4
You're getting a whole new Civ-like game
That's dumbed down slightly for consoles
But sometimes dumbed down can be a good thing
Yeah, Prowler says in chat there, Simplified can be a good thing
And Rama says in chat, Rob is a Civ fanboy, of course he's gonna love it
Well, yeah
I don't know if I'd say I love it
Like I love the original Civilization
I love Civ 4
But I like it a lot
So far
So we'll see about that
Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight
Again, just to kind of put it out there
We are only doing a part A tonight
And that has to do with the whole E3
And things being outdated
However, I have some good news
Now we're not bitter at all about not being able to go to E3
I mean, no one invited us to the cool kids party
We're not bitter at all about not being able to go
Oh, it's great
My work got an invite, but they didn't go
It's like, oh, we don't want to take it
I haven't been interested in going since they changed it
Although I hear there's no lines in any of that stuff anymore
I would just want to go to hang out with the cool kids
But apparently we are not part of that clique
But the hell with them
The hell with them
We are starting E3 right now
We're starting E3 right now
E3 begins right now on this very radio show that you are listening to
With our very own
OLR E3 press conference
And you're all invited
Alright, and we have our own E3 surprises in store for you tonight
So the official OLR E3 press conference
Blah, blah, blah
We've had wonderful support from all of our listeners
Over the past six years of our existence
Blah, blah, blah
Our show is still making no money at all
But it's sure fun to listen to and do
Blah, blah, blah
Okay, let's get to the good stuff
We have three announcements tonight that will change our show a little bit
For the future
Now one of these you have probably heard about a little bit
But we're just kind of confirming it on our own program tonight
And that is that we are going to PAX
Penny Arcade Expos
If E3 won't have us
Then F you
We're going to go to Penny Arcade Expo
I think that's funny because isn't that also Latin for peace?
I'm not sure
I didn't do research before tonight's press conference
But we'll say yes for now
But here's the thing
It gets better
Now sadly Loki is not going to PAX because of the wife
But you know things happen
But myself and Dark Sakura are going to PAX
But it gets better
Not only are we going to PAX
We are going to be on the floor
Actually broadcasting live radio
It's a partnership thing that we're doing with All Games Radio
They're actually going to be set up there
Out there on the floor with like bean bags around
It's something called the Sumo Lounge
I myself have not been to PAX
I don't know what this is
But it's going to be near the tabletop gaming and the press room area
They're going to have the Sumo Lounge with bean bags
And we're actually going to be broadcasting from the show
Friday, Saturday, Sunday
That's 3 hours on Friday starting at 4 Pacific
3 hours on Saturday starting at 4 Pacific
And 2 hours on Sunday starting at 4 Pacific as well
The whole thing is going to be moderated by Bobby Blackwolf
Our buddy that precedes us here on Orange Lounge Radio
We will be a part of that
We'll be kind of on and off of there
We might do our own podcast from the site to supplement it
But we'll be live as a part of this on All Games Radio
It's not just us
DMN, your old pal from our network as well as Understation Live
He's going to be there
Bobby's there
Super happy fun time show
Dead Pixel Live
Electric Sisterhood
Game Addict Hotline
Shatterbox
Evil Avatar
All there, all represented at Penny Arcade Expo
It is the freaking Voltron of independent podcasting
Live
August 29th, 30th, and 31st in Seattle
And if you can't be there in person you can still listen to the madness on
AllGames.com
It's going to be awesome
Bobby would like to clarify it is not in the exhibit hall
But it's still within the convention center
So there it is
And the OLR PAX broadcast will also be podcasted
Bobby will let you know when our segment is
That we're going to be on it
And it's apparently going to be its own special podcast
So stay tuned to AllGames.com for more information on that
Second announcement
You asked for it, you got it
We're going to do it
I know that part B has been very delayed lately
Throughout the week in getting pushed to the podcast feed
So we're going to try something new
Don't say that OLR doesn't listen to the listeners
Starting with next week's show
Part A and B will be released as one giant show
Parts A and B combined into one giant show
And we will have something that kind of even runs in between the shows
When you're listening to them on the podcast
It will not be the show itself
But probably promos for other shows
And other fun things that we want to try doing with the podcast
Some of these joke ads and things that we were talking about
We're going to kind of start to get our feet wet with that
So starting next week parts A and B combined in one part
So you no longer have to wait until like Friday or Saturday to hear the whole thing
You will get to download it Monday at the latest
Which will be pretty awesome
Alright
And the third announcement
And my favorite
Is really awesome
Loki why don't you tell the listeners a little more about this
What you've been working on for the past few weeks
Yes and unfortunately I wish I could say that I was done but I'm not
That's okay because at E3 you sometimes tease things that aren't coming out until Christmas
And this should be out a lot sooner than this
It's not going to be until Christmas
I definitely hope that
I worked my ass off for the last
Probably about a month on this
Anyways yes you finally are going to get an update to OLRPSP.com
Finally
But there's some good stuff coming with that
The big part of it is actually going to be
The brand new OLRPSP all games radio streamer
Which is going to be
Kind of like the radio players that you see on the PSP
But definitely a lot cooler than all those
In fact
Hopefully that will be released soon
With that will be the OLRPSP flash chat
I tried my hardest to get IRC chat but
It just wasn't happening
And let me reiterate because I saw the draft of what this looks like
And you're going to be posting screenshots to Orange Lawns Radio a little later on right
This is actually the way it looks in your PSP
It is not something you don't even have to go to OLRPSP.com in your browser
It looks like an application loaded in there
Like the other radio station listeners
When you click it, it takes you to a live radio feed
That is broadcasting all games radio
This is the part that Bobby didn't even know about
It even is taking that little box with the times of the upcoming shows from the website
And showing that as part of the player
It is awesome
And then other things are going to be included with that
There's also going to be
All the RSS feeds are going to be in there as well
You'll be able to listen to podcasts
From all the different shows and stuff
You'll be able to select through that stuff
Details on all the other shows on all games
There's a lot of small things I'm working on right now unfortunately
IRC chat on the PSP
I even tried buying the PSP IRC script
And the guy is a douchebag and won't fucking sell it
Even for a lot of money
I don't think you're supposed to say douchebag in an E3
That's alright
Breaking new ground here ya douchebags
Anyways
And then I'm going to have some more download stuff as well
I wanted to work on a theme and stuff
But it's just
Seriously I've been in my computer room forever
I will post some screenshots though into chat
So you can see a few screenshots I've taken
But it's still a work in progress
And I'm hopefully going to have it done very soon
Alright
Prowler in chat room says
This is already better than last year's Microsoft press conference
Well thank you
We try
So any estimated time on when this is going to be out
Like before the end of the month? August-ish?
I'm hoping before the end of next week
But we'll see
Oh and you've even posted a link of what one of the screenshots looks like to chat
That's going to be awesome
Oh there's two coming
So our live listeners get to see it
For those of you listening on the taped podcast
You can look at those on our forums quite soon
Those will be up very soon on our forums
OrangeLawnTrader.com click on forums
Alright
That does it again to reiterate our three points
Of this year's E3 press conference
E3 won't have us so the hell with them
We're going to PAX and it's going to be even better
Part A and B will be combined starting next week
With the podcast and the OLR PSP.com
OLR PSP.com
New website and radio tuner application
That takes you direct to AllGames.com
Radio feed coming soon
Yeah because
The PSP sucks
And it doesn't, you know, unfortunately
It takes a fucking long time to
Put pages on there because
You make it in a program for the PC
You view it on your PC and it looks nice
And you take it to your PSP and it looks like shit
So it's a long
Process
Well anyhow we are going to
Shift gears and get into our regular
Show tonight as if a press conference
Wasn't enough we have a whole regular show
To get to and that is tonight's gaming news
And Loki once again starting us off with tonight's gaming news
Alright
Well this is not
A big surprise but Konami has
Lodged a patent suit against Harmonix
And MTV over Rockband
And
I mean, I don't know
There's definitely I guess some merit to it
Seeing as it looks very
Similar to
Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, the whole setup
I'm just surprised it took them this long
But I mean
You know
Maybe they're not licensing the technology
Like Guitar Hero is
So
If that's the case you know I do think Konami
Is owed some money although it is kind of cheap to do
That and then release their game
Which their game looks like a cheap knock off
Of Rockband I don't know it's just
I wish they had done this
A lot sooner like put out their game
Instead of just bitching
About the other games coming out
Katamari's Forever in chat says confusing lawsuit is confusing
It is kind of in depth
What is it that Konami is specifically
Taking issue the way I understood it
It has to do with the controller
It's not necessarily so much the game itself
But it seems to be the fact that it's a guitar controller
Very similar to what Guitar Freaks was
When it was out here in the US
In very small arcade test markets
A long time ago
That's their point of contention
Yeah and they do have the patents in place for it
I mean I'm sure they do because it's been out for
You know years now
So
Yeah I mean they're in the right there
To defend their patent
When Rockband first came out
I guess now that they figure there's money
Involved in it and they can make a lot of money off of it
Then yeah that's
They should do it but at the same time
I kind of wish that they were just leading
You know the music gaming industry
Instead of just trying to follow and just
Make money off of lawsuits
Because now their new game
Which to be honest I don't really care too much about
And it looks kind of cheap
So
I don't know
Personally I think it kind of stinks
Because you know obviously I enjoy Rockband
But it's kind of one of those things in the back of my mind
I kind of always wondered
You know if Konami sued those folks that did
In the groove I'm kind of surprised
They never tried to go after Rockband
And then especially after hearing that
Activision's already been paying them under the table
For quite some time
For the whole Guitar Hero thing
Red Octane and Konami have had a long relationship
And then I kind of thought well maybe part of the reason
This took so long to happen is because
Konami have had somewhat of a long relationship too
With the whole karaoke revolution thing
But you know the whole timing of this lawsuit is
Awfully odd
With their games coming out this year and everything
And I think it kind of stinks but at the same time
I don't know there might be some merit to it
I just hope it doesn't stop Rockband
You know and also I think
You know well with that hole in the groove thing come on
It really was a freaking copy
Of DDR I mean in the groove was
Freaking DDR with minds and like a couple
Innovative things you know
We talked about it way past the history of our show
About the whole in the groove thing
I mean we all saw that coming a mile away
By the way we called it too
We said Konami's going to sue these folks
When they try to invade the home market
And sure enough when that in the groove game
Came out for PS2 that's when Konami
Sicked the Bulldogs on them
But it does make this whole thing interesting that Rockband's
Been out for like a year, year and a half
I mean does it, well not quite a year and a half
But about a year I mean does it take that long for a lawsuit
To get rolling? No it's just they want to
See how successful it is now that it's
You know finally come around and
They're going to be putting out their sequel and stuff
They want a piece of the money
Interesting
DarkSocker do you have any thoughts on this?
Because I know you twitted some stuff
Earlier in the week I'm curious kind of where your thought is
At this point in time with the whole suit
I think that it's petty
And ridiculous they
Had their chance when
And you know it was funny remember talking to
Jason Anis all those years ago about
Trying to bring the money
Into the US and
Working on getting Guitar Freaks and everything
They had their chance
And they had their advocate then
Did they hop on it? No
So someone came along and did it better
And you know what I think you're speaking
A lot of the same things that the music game
Community is saying is that there's this
Round of disappointment in Konami
Because you know
They had all these, this Beatmania
Series in Japan was awesome
The 2DX series awesome
Guitar Freaks, Drummania, people loved it
People were importing that stuff and everybody
Was asking why aren't you bringing it out here?
And it took one of their own
People on the USA side
Jason to twist the
Fucking arm of the Japanese
Side and we barely got DDR
And you barely got DDR and then
DDR was a huge success and
Remember how shitty that first mix
Of DDR was
Everyone was happy
And then it would just cause a landslide to DDR after that
Look how successful it's been
And then Beatmania 2DX the problem was
They didn't learn from their mistakes
They released a kind of a shoddy 2DX mix
I mean they took some risks with it
Which were kind of cool at the whole 5 key thing
But it just wasn't enough
They didn't take enough risks with licensing
That's where Guitar Hero and Rock Band
Whooped them is that they knew what the American
Audience wanted and they went for it
And I'm sorry if this offends you
Anime folks and J-Pop loving folks
That like the Bamani songs
That are in the 2DX but all of those
Songs would never have worked here
And that's kind of proven
By the 2DX release over here
It needed more
And that crappy cover of Toxic and
One Moby song that wasn't enough
It needed like half and half at least
It needed more songs that could have reached out to the American audience
But anyhow
So but my question is
Despite the
The kind of resentment we almost feel towards
Konami for not taking the freaking risk sooner
And now looking almost like a copycat
With this whole Rock Revolution thing
Does it make it right though?
Does it make it still that their lawsuit doesn't have any ground
To stand on because as disappointed as I am at
Konami I still go but
They have a point
I don't know I mean any thoughts
On that I mean do you think you still think
It's kind of like petty or
I mean I don't know
It's still petty
The format I think is so different
And so much
The other thing it has to be
Is whether or not they actually did in effect
Go and re-engineer
You know
What Konami had done
How long was the trademark out
For their controllers
And plus I think Red Octane knew what they were doing
When they originally put out Guitar Hero
They knew what they were doing
And that's why there's those under the table payments
That's what we're calling it but you know what I mean
To um Konami
But Harmonic should have known
What they were getting into as well
And I love Harmonic
So Harmonic makes some great games
That's what kind of makes this disappointing
But they kind of should have known that this might happen
It's just kind of disappointing
I don't know
Going off some comments from chat
Because I'm sure there's a lot of folks in chat
Gerardimo says 2DX was based on the assumption
That only DDR players had heard of would be playing this
That's why just about all the songs on it are in DDR
Kind of
But they really pushed Beatmania at E3
Like it was their big title but then the title itself
By the time it comes out
I mean god remember that G4 clip
Where they were calling it a Guitar Hero knockoff
And all the beat uh
Bamani fanboys were getting angry
Remember that
And then some talk as well in chat about the whole MTV Drumscape thing
Shouldn't MTV already have some type of patents on drums
Because of Drumscape
Well even if they have patents on drums they may not have patents on guitar
And I think that's Konami's issue
I don't think Konami was doing anything about the drums
I don't know
Technically Konami could be sued by the creators of uh
Several of the MIDI guitars too
Or Gibson
Well yeah but
Well Konami's guitars when they first came out
They didn't really resemble any type of real
You know form of guitar
It was fairly
I'd say an innocent design
If you know what I mean
But um
Obviously the MIDI guitars
Especially ones that have worked on Switch like that
Have existed for you know
Since the 80's at least
Um Game Guru in chat says
If Immersion could win against Sony
Konami can win against EA
And I think that's what it's gonna be settled out of court
One way or another I think
I think that's what's gonna happen
Hopefully it doesn't prevent Rock Band 2 or delay it any further
I don't think it will
Yeah I don't think it will either I think it'll settle out of court
I think uh they're gonna have to make those payments
But the problem is Konami
Their game that they're bringing out this winter
Is gonna have to really kick ass
And from or they're gonna have that
They're gonna look like jerks
I'm honestly I don't see
How they're gonna innovate on this at all
The bar is very low right now
Yeah I mean
Just looking at their drum set that they have set up
It looks stupid
It really does look stupid compared to some of this other stuff that's come out
For me it's all about the song list
I'd be very and you know well
You know atmosphere and all that is nice too
So I would hope the game is good looking
But uh song list is very very important
Uh Rama says what you all forget
Is that Rock Revolution focuses more on drums
Not guitar
Well that's nice that it focuses on drums
But I still think it should focus on everything
Since you know that's what
Rock Band is doing
Including keyboard
It focuses on everything Rock Band they have you know
Solid you know vocals
They have solid guitars and drums
It's not just one or the other
Alright well um
More to come on this as the weeks go by
I'm sure we'll hear about the settlement very soon
Or at least some type of further comment from
Harmonics and Viacom
And all those people outside of uh
This is stupid
Anyhow speaking of Konami and their music games
DDR is still trekking along
And Dance Dance Revolution X
Is the new game that is coming out on the Playstation
2 or later this year
And you know there's more DDR games coming out for the home consoles
But what might have surprised some people
This is also going to be an arcade port
Dance Dance Revolution X will be coming
To the arcades and
It is a whole new cabinet
It looks like it's actually something on a widescreen monitor
Um there's some pictures that have been posted
Over at uh bombanistyle.com
Which I believe came from that
ZenSI Vanisher site
Of an actual new cabinet and what it looks like
Some of the names have been changed like
Beginner mode is starter mode, advanced mode, course mode
There's now shock arrows
In the game which is basically mines
Although I seem to recall DDR
Has had poison arrows before
It was in one of the Ultramix games, go back and look
Um there's also going to be the
Link feature, USB
Cards will now handle edit data
So yeah
Edit data is coming back to the DDR series
Thanks to a USB memory cord
And apparently good edit data
Is going to go worldwide on eAmusement
That's pretty cool
The most commonly played stuff will be back in the game
Older songs possibly making a comeback
60 plus new songs
Including licenses and new originals
And uh developers
Say that they are committed to putting
1.5 times the amount of new content
Content in future mixes
And another thing I believe I was hearing about this
Betzen is now not involved in this
They were doing the cabinets for Supernova
Apparently they are not involved in this any longer
That could be part of the reason
I'm not sure though about all the changes
More information to come when these machines
Start being spotted out there in the wild
But uh Konami is still trying to do stuff
With their DDR series
Definitely and somewhat
You know at least
At least one of those tracks
Is probably going to be pretty good
And now there's folks saying that the poison arrows
Thing is taken from in the group
But correct me if I'm wrong
In one of the early early DDR games
Like second mix or some crap
Wasn't there like a mode where there were arrows
That you weren't supposed to step on
I thought in one of the early earlier DDR mixes
There was something like that
I don't know
I think maybe like challenge mode or something like that
Well there was also the one where you weren't supposed to step on
Any arrows that weren't currently up on the screen
But oh well
I don't think it's anything that surprising
Honestly and anyway
I didn't really call to mind things that much
Innovation in the first place
You know sure it was something new
But it didn't exactly reinvent the game
So I don't think it's that big a deal
And he's kind of putting it in this new game
I kind of think they're a little dumb anyway
I hope they don't overuse them
But we'll see
So coming to arcade soon
Well something
That makes me happy in particular
And this makes me uber happy
Is that
There is going to be
Another Sega Aegis PS2
Release
That is the Fantasy Zone Complete Collection
Which was
I do think
Fantasy Zone 2 DX
Before
But hey it's more Fantasy Zone
And I hope it's actually done up like the
The Sega Aegis
One that I already have on PS2
That was part of the Sega Aegis
2500 set
Which was named that because it was
2500 yen
But this is supposed to be
From what this says on here
Fantasy Zone, Fantasy Zone 2
Fantasy Zone Gear, Super Fantasy Zone
Oppa Oppa Galactic Protector
Fantasy Zone 2 Remake
And the Sega Aegis 2500 Volume 3
Fantasy Zone version
Sounds like a lot of Fantasy Zone
Get ready! Sounds like Do You Want
Because I think I actually have most of these
I wonder if Oppa Oppa was
Fantasy Zone 3 The Maze
Especially if there's some updated graphics
And sound and all that's usually a good thing
I want an Oppa Oppa
A little plushy or something?
I know, I do want one
Well who knows, maybe they'll be showing this
Maybe I should cosplay the Oppa Oppa one year
Maybe they'll show this to Tokyo Game Show or something
A little more in it, we'll see
I told you this story, Rob, but one time I was trying to look for the Oppa Oppa music
I ended up downloading a
Happy song in Greek
It's called Oppa Oppa
Because that means like, yay
Interesting
I'm sure it was a better song than Caramel Dancin
I'm sure that's for sure
Fantasy Zone is still a ways out
But we have some stuff coming out
A lot sooner than that, right Loki?
Yes, this week there's some
Pretty interesting stuff coming out actually
Especially if you like football
There's NCAA Football 09
And that's coming out on
PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3
Xbox 360, Wii, and the PSP
And also there is a game based off the
Looks like crap movie
But Space Chimps
That will be out on PC, PlayStation 2
The Wii
And I believe the
360 and DS
Also
Hunting Unlimited, 2009
Coming to the PC
That looks like shit as well
Code Lyoko, Quest for Infinity
On PSP
Nancy Drew, The Clue Bender
Society on the DS
For those who may have Rock Band
On PlayStation 2 or Wii
You'll get your Rock Band Track Pack
Volume 1 this week
Which has 30 songs you can play
And that's
Let's see here
And
I think that's about it
Trying to keep it I guess a little bit light
Next week though, or the week after
Next is actually going to be pretty nice with Final Fantasy 4
I would imagine
There's going to be some surprises
With the whole E3 thing
At least as far as downloadable stuff goes
Oh yeah, most definitely
In fact I was just pulling up some last minute
Story things and I've already seen
Two more speculated Xbox Live arcade games
That are going to be in there
If all the ruined ones come out
There will be like four different games coming out next week
We'll see what happens
Hey traveling over to Japan, it's a little bit of a light week
For you guys over there too
Probably for the same reasons as light over here
Dark Messiah Might and Magic Elements
July 17th coming from Ubisoft
Coming out on other systems
Such as the Playstation 3, Metal Gear Online
Makes its way so
That could also be a reason why it's a slow week otherwise
Because that's definitely an anticipated title
That is coming out for only 20 bucks
So check that out on the Playstation 3
Also coming out on the Playstation 3
Tears to Tiara
Kaka no Daichi
That is a game coming from Aqua Plus
And it not only comes out in Japan
But all Asia regions on the Playstation 3
Taking a look at the Nintendo Wii
Boom Blocks gets its Japanese release this week
That's a game I have
That I still need to play
I bought it and I haven't even played it yet
Because I got a big discount on it
Because I have friends in low places
On the Playstation 2, Shining Force EXA
And Shining Wind get price reductions into the best series
But if you want to check out something new
You can check out Poi Hito Natsu no Kaiken
That comes out in regular and limited edition formats
From Idea Factory
And taking a look at the handhelds
There is a ton of stuff coming out
Including
Dragon Quest 5
And I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be all over that one
And there's even like matching cases
And protectors to match that
It's going to be pretty awesome
The game Exit gets a DS port as well
That's actually in Korea however
Also
You know I got to get this, Hello Kitty
No Panda Sports Stadium comes out
On the DS as well as Metal Slug 7
Comes out this week in Japan
And with the Hello Kitty game
Some new Hello Kitty pouches
In pink and white so you can carry
Your game and style
And if that doesn't work for you
How about the Sugar Bunnies pouch
That comes out in blue and pink
It's a very girly week in the Nintendo DS world
But hey at least you have Metal Gear on Playstation 3
To counteract that
And on the PSP
There's some stuff over there too
Gundam Battle Universe makes its way out to the PSP
And if that's not your style
Hime Hibe Princess Days Portable is more
Up your alley coming out on
July 17th on the PSP
That's your Japanese release date
I was mesmerized
I know, awesome
I have four games
That are going to be out in the next week
And I'm going to go ahead and name one for next Sunday too
Just because by the time I
Say anything on that day it'd be too late
So given that it'll be the next day already
So for
The UK we have three games
On the 18th we have, well actually two
Different systems
Baroque on PS2 and Wii
And Guitar Hero on Tour on
DS which is not all that fun
Sorry
Spoiler!
And then on the 20th CID 925
An Ordinary Life on PSP
Small week for Europe, sadly
Very small
But also I think our Europe releases they really only cover the big
Big stuff and not a lot of the little
Stuff like we have over in Japan
This list we use has everything
On it, not
Not necessarily all AAA titles
How about Virtual Console over in the
UK? We do have some fun
For the Virtual Console
The first one
Sorry I love the description
That Eurogamer gives it
I'm going to quote
The first of these is Ninja Commando
A top down vertically scrolling shooter
That has ninja and commandos and time travel
It also has a rubbish but very funny English translation
That's the best description ever
I cracked up when I saw it
Ninjas, commandos, what else do you need?
Time travel!
Now what else do you need? That's it
A rubbish English translation
Perfect, everything I want in a game
Make your time
Art of Fighting 2 is
Another one which is just a
Fighting game but it
Had
Tons of jokes for Capcom came from that
Do you know the Art of Fighting?
And it's
The game series that also spawned us are
Dan Hibiki
It has a fighter named after me, that's all I need
Robert
Hello
You should cosplay him
No thank you
Anyway, the Neo Geo games are going to be
900 Wii points
Translating to 9 euros
Or 6 pounds 30
So go get them
That's an order
After E3 you should probably have some more fun
Yep
Now I'm sure this came to a big surprise to everybody
This morning but
Microsoft has confirmed that guess what
The Xbox 360 20 gig
Pro system
Has dropped in price to $299
I am so surprised
That is a big shocker
And also surprising and completely not already leaked
Already
That there will be introducing a new
Big console that's going to be
Arriving early August
That will be the current $349
So they're not really dropping
The price, they're just kind of
Upgrading for the same price
So at the press conference tomorrow you guys
Act surprised
Just act surprised
Exactly
Especially when they mention the avatars
And stuff, pretend that you didn't hear it already
Or that you didn't hear about
Some of the lips rumors leaking out
There on the internet
We have never heard of this game called Lips
That apparently is under development
But here's the thing
Variety magazine which is a magazine
Really for the industry of entertainment
It covers mostly movies, television, music
That stuff, but it does dabble in gaming
And it talked in a recent article
About the Lips project
So hello, if that wasn't confirmation
What do you need
It is going to be at E3
Apparently some of the box art has leaked out
I wouldn't say that, but the wireless microphones
Have apparently leaked out as well
So that's pretty cool that they're wireless microphones
But get this, I love this
The microphones apparently have lights in them
At the base of the microphone have these
Colored lights that are supposedly
I guess they're two rings of
Light that are blue or red
And apparently the way you sing
Controls the lights
So I guess it's one of those things
Where maybe it's red most of the time
I think the blue or red are just to indicate
Which player it is
Because they have the same kind of thing
On SingStar
What's interesting, and you may not remember that
From the leaked survey that was out there
But they're supposed to be motion sensitive
Those microphones
And they allow you to
In the game you're supposed to be singing and dancing
And it's supposed to pick up the movement
Oh god
Get ready to look like an ass in your living room
I'll pitch you anything
That little camera works with the game too
Well I hope it works with something
Because you know
I paid good money for that camera
Exactly, and now we hardly ever get to use it
But no, this game does sound cool already
I'm very curious to see
What the actual game itself
Because even though we've seen the box art, we've seen the mics
We've seen the concept, we know it's probably
Most likely being developed by the Elite Beat agents
Folks, we have yet to see screens
But tomorrow at E3 we should get some screens
I'm gonna take a wild guess here
And call me a psychic
But I'm gonna guess that they're gonna look
Something very similar to
Sing Star, Karaoke Revolution
Rock Band
And probably Guitar Hero World Tour
It would be rad though if it was something
Kinda different, you never know
Except it probably won't be
It probably won't
Stop it Debbie Downer
Raining on my parade
Gerardimo says if you sing badly, do you get a light show?
Chat.orangelandtrader.com
That'd be kinda cool
Why should you get a
Why do you deserve a light show if you suck?
I don't know, maybe it's
Consolation Prize, who knows
But Lips, that's one of the titles
I can't wait to hear about at Microsoft Press Conference
Well
You'll have to wait, I'm sorry Rob
I know, but it's being
It's being streamed online like everywhere
And it's supposed to be on TV and all this stuff
I'm gonna watch it during work tomorrow
Sadly I have to teach tomorrow
So I can't watch the conference during work
I'm gonna be refreshing some of the gaming blogs
On my break to see what's announced
Well how is this for some happy information
Mega Man 9
Is actually
They said it was gonna be
WiiWare coming onto Xbox Live Arcade
And PlayStation Network
That's gonna be kinda weird
Playing a Nintendo style game on Xbox Live
But that's cool
Now I don't have to worry about storage issues
On my Wii, hooray
It could be some sort of HD version though
It sucks for you
It sucks for you Nintendo cause I was gonna buy that game
And now I'm not
But for anyone who's gonna get it on Wii
It's gonna be about 10 bucks and there is a trailer floating around
So go find it
I did watch the trailer for the game and it lets you see
What some of the boss monsters look like
Cause you see little silhouettes of them
I wonder if this thing looks like a mantis
Splash Woman for the record looks like
Kind of a mermaid-ish looking thing
More like a naga, she looks like Lady Vash
Actually
Warcraft joke, but I'm serious
That's what she kinda looked like in the trailer
Like one of those Poseidon ladies
And some of the other robots are kinda cool too
You can only see their silhouettes
But I am all kinds of excited about Mega Man 9
I would be more excited if they come out at E3 and say
It's available now
But I doubt it seeing as we've already heard rumors
Of a September release date
Still, that's not that far off
Something else that's not very far off too
Is a rumored
Silver DS system
Which will be coming out in the US
Now
The story actually is coming from
Go Nintendo
They have a source that says
That the
I guess the DS that was with
Guitar Hero
That bundle that came out
Is gonna be hitting stores
I don't know what they're talking about
I mean that's totally news to me
Yeah
I would be very surprised
If we saw it like in September or something
And it was actually the silver and black DS
That was with the Guitar Hero bundle
That would be really surprising
Wouldn't that be neat?
That would be neat. Surprising.
Completely surprised.
Just as surprising as Microsoft's price
Conference will be tomorrow.
But folks do really need more colors for the DS
I mean seriously.
I guess they're still selling
What about Wii colors?
You think Nintendo's gonna give us some Wii colors finally?
Not that I'd go buy a new Wii
Just because it's a different color
They won't change the color of the Wii
Until it starts dropping in sales or
Flattening out
If they release a pink Wii
I would actually consider it for a little bit
Maybe I could find a good place
A good home for my current white, boring Wii
Who knows. Speaking of rumors
It's something that's definitely all around this week
And kinda interesting
Apparently Duke Nukem 3D
Xbox Live Arcade screenshots
Are floating around out there
I guess this is being shown
Or this is being lifted off of that whole
What do they call that? Partner net?
The game costs
Supposedly 1,337
Microsoft points, which I'm sure is a joke
Same for the trial though too
Actually gonna charge that, yeah
But it also kinda makes you go
Hmm, could it be a photoshop?
It could be a photoshop
But what's interesting about it is that apparently
Some achievements have also leaked for the game
The world looks like a cleanup on aisle 4
Is the achievement
And to get that
You have to step in a pile of poop
I wish I was joking
But that is really the achievement
And the picture of the achievement
Looks like a pile of poop
Which makes me think
This is even more of a fake, but you never know
They had poop in the game
Yeah I know, but if these screenshots
Are fake, it's a damn good fake
I'll give them that
But we'll find out
I'm sure tomorrow
Would you think that this might be
One of their games, like they did this with Doom
Didn't they? Then they come out at some European
We can't have 5 Xbox Live arcade games
Coming out tomorrow, or next week
Sure we could
I would like that, but we can't
I think we all would
Especially something like Duke Nukem
Dude, if Duke Nukem comes out on the Xbox 360
I am buying that game day one
I am fucking there
I really hope it's not one of those things
Where I buy it and then I go
This was so much cooler when I was 12
Like Doom was
Doom, I never really played much of Doom
Duke Nukem was awesome
I played that for hours
We're so playing some Duke Nukem when this comes out
Loki, I hope it's not a fake
And if it is a fake
Whoever faked it, I hope you burn in hell
For getting my hopes up
I hope you step in many piles of poop
For the rest of your life
And the Middle Eastern curse that applies
May the fleas of a thousand camels nest in your genitals
Yes, and poop
In your genitals
Haha, poop in your genitals
This show is rated T for trashy
For all the toilet humor
It's rated P for poo-poo
Speaking of poo-poo
Hey
No, I wasn't talking about you
I was talking about someone else
That thankfully doesn't come on this program
The king of poopy headedness
Which would be
He who shall not be named
I'll have you know
And this is just a funny little bit of trivia
That chat room that I put together
For the PSP site
The only bad word filter that's on there
Is Jack Thompson
And it will actually change it to
Lord Voldemort for you
Well done, Loki, well done
Alright, so yes, what is the latest in
your world?
Well, the judge
Who is
I think is in charge of the trial
Dava Tunis, I guess is the name
Has referred to
He who shall not be named
As mentally impaired
And
A raving wild
woman
Wait, a raving wild woman?
No, Nick Thompson referred to her as that
I'm sorry, I gotcha
He referred to her as mentally impaired and a raving wild woman
My bad
I wish a judge would refer to him as a raving wild woman
You crazy bitch, sit down
Well, the judge
Has recommended that Tom
That dude be assessed
$43,675
Fine for legal
Costs incurred by the Florida bar
And he has been found guilty
Of 27 of 31 charges
In a misconduct
Suit and
The judge wants him disbarred
I love that they have it figured out
Down to the dollar
You know what would make that even better?
If it was figured out down to the cent
It is figured out down to the cent, actually
On Kotaku, they had the cents
It was like
$36.35 or something
It was 35 cents, I remember that
Hugs and kisses to the folks who made that happen
He should be forced to pay it on site
To me?
No, to the Florida bar
Alright, fine
But then to me
He is just a fucker
And you know what
As much as this is actually
Kind of good news in a way
That maybe he will finally be forced to go away
Although I am sure he will troll all the blogs still
Just hearing that name
Lord Voldemort inspires fear
And anger in me
So we will be getting to the FUs of the week soon
But there is more, apparently
I just wanted to read the actual first
Line on this one
Because I actually did check on Game Politics
It says the Florida bar has recommended disbarment
For a period of 10 years
This court respectfully declines to follow
The bar's recommendation
The case involves
Factual findings of cumulative misconduct
A repeated pattern of behavior
Relentlessly forced upon numerous
Unconnected individuals
A total lack of remorse
Or even slight acknowledgement of inappropriate conduct
So
So
The bottom two things
I will go ahead and skip to the last paragraph
Thus after careful consideration
Of the underlying facts and the
Instant cases
Together with the Florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions
And applicable aggravating and mitigating factors
In the precedent case law
This court makes the following recommendations for John Bruce Thompson
His middle name is Bruce
Flees in your pants
In your genitals
A. Permanent disbarment with no leave to reapply for admission
B. Disciplinary costs
Currently totalling
$43,675.35
Nice
Currently totalling
Can we burn on the angst now?
Can we burn on the angst now?
Apparently news about
Lord of Voldemort makes you gassy
I was opening my mouth to say something
And it said I had a juice burp
Nice
Multi-part F.U. Number 1
The heat returning
And
Number 2
To people
Who think
That they have the right
To tell someone else
What to say or do or think
Just because they themselves are offended
You know what I mean?
Why don't people learn how to fucking
Roll with the punches?
No
Not in general
It's just in general
At a point of saturation
Where I'm just sick with all these people
Who are like
I don't like what you did Sue
Or
You said a mean thing about me
And Sue
And just people who
Don't know how to get the fuck over themselves
And get on with it
You know what?
Since somebody says something shitty about you
Why should it matter?
And also on the same lines
F.U. to anyone
Now I'm going to say fuck you to anyone who tries to tell me
How I should talk
This is America
There's nothing in the Constitution
That limits my ability to say
Fuck, shit, damn, cock or any other
So-called curse word that I wish to say
In any type of form
Unless it is specifically said
As part of a private organization
That these words are not allowed
As part of my employment say
That's fine
But I can stand outside of my place of employment and go
Fuck!
All I want to
And it's legal
And by the way DarkSakura
The lawyers will be calling about the lawsuit with the fleas in my genitals
I also plan on
Cursing in front of my children
I'll tell you why
The Osborn kids came down only slightly fucked up
I had a discussion about this with my friend
Who's a parent as well
She's not going to have any problem with
You know, say if a kid falls and goes
Oh damn, or shit that hurts
She's not going to have a problem with it
But have a problem if someone uses it specifically in a
Derogatory or attacking way
So teach someone to be nice
You can learn when it's appropriate
When it's not appropriate
But I'm not going to discourage my children
If I ever have any
To have to curtail their own freedom of speech
For somebody else's comfort
I don't have kids yet
Maybe someday, but I'm still thinking
Kind of a similar thing because
If you don't make it such a bad thing
Then kids won't want to do it
You know, half the reason why I think
That a lot of
Kids act out about stuff or try to be rebellious
Kids, I'm sorry, they're going to look for something
To be rebellious about
You say don't cuss, they're just going to start cussing like a sailor
That's the truth
I think that if you set the example
That say, well
It's not something to get worked up over
If we don't care
Then they're not going to try to do it to get attention
Just give them the proper attention that they need
Misty in chat says, see that's another reason
I don't have an intention of having
Demon spawn
I'm actually thinking in the next two years
Oh my heck
That could be something
Alright, Loki, your F.E. is the week
And I'm going to probably still be here every Sunday
With the baby?
Maybe
No, I'm going to make Dan babysit
Anyway, Loki
F.E. is the PSP web browser for sucking
That's all I got
Yeah, mine's short too
F.U. to smoke, and I don't mean the fighter
In Mortal Kombat 3 or 4 or whatever
Even though he kind of sucked too
I'm talking about the smoke that's out there in the air
Like a fucking volcano blew up in my backyard
It's pretty horrible
And thankfully I don't still live up in Chico
Where all the fires are happening
Because I hear up in Chico it's raining ash
Can you imagine if you walked outside one day and it's raining ash
That sucks
It's like you are actually living in hell
For Dante's Peak
Without
Or Pompeii the day before
Yeah, without
Frickin' what's-her-name-for-the-Terminator
Being there
Alright, alright
Well
There's more rumors
We have to say this, I'm sorry
Gulp Banjo in chat says
Jamie, have the baby live on air
It can be an educational thing
The miracle of life
Really?
I've already discussed it
When I do squirt out my own demon spawn
I'm going to have a midwife and do it at home
When the parasite crawls out
Actually it's funny, my friend
Becky is so awesome
We kept referring to her baby as her symbiote
Alright, look
We've got to get back to gaming
We'll have baby chat another time
You know the big reason why you don't want to have babies?
What?
When you have a baby hanging out around that part of the body
It shoves the rest of your organs up behind your ribcage
That's why moms get heartburn
It's true
Loki
Loki, less baby, more game
Well, these controllers
You may be able to use it to shove organs of your enemies
Up into their ribcage
But, I don't know
Anyways, there's a rumor
There's still rumors going around that
Microsoft's going to reveal some sort of motion controllers
And if that's true
Then they're thinking that maybe that these
Motus Games
Darwin controllers are actually
The 360 motion controllers
Well, there's a few reasons why they may think that
One, the controllers kind of fit the color scheme
They are white plastic
And they've got
Four lights on them indicating that you can use
Four at one time
Which kind of makes them a little bit different
Than say the Wii remote and stuff like that
They're kind of
I don't know
You can attach them to each other
So you can take two of them and break them apart
Or make them into one giant
Remote, which is kind of weird
But, they have
Some video kind of showing off
Because right now these are only for the PC
Showing them
Being used like Tiger Woods
Lego, Star Wars
Stuff like that
So they look pretty cool
And they work pretty much just like the Wii Remote and Nunchuck
But they are wireless, which is nice
So you don't have a stupid cord tethering you together
I don't know
I guess we'll find out tomorrow
Or today, depending on when you listen to the podcast
Alright, stay tuned
I'm sure we'll be talking a lot about the E3 announcements next week
Do you think
Microsoft getting into motion control is a good thing?
I don't know
I don't know, it would depend on how they did it
And I'd hopefully
It would be optional stuff
Do you think that they would try to release a Wii Sports
Style game as like their passion game
Or do you think that would be completely obvious?
I think that would be kind of stupid
But, I could see if they did
Put out motion control or that you would get a lot more
Of those crappy games on the 360
Maybe
Xbox Live Arcade titles and stuff?
That wouldn't be too bad
I just worry because they don't really support
The camera they put out
There's a couple games that use it
But that's really it
But their whole thing right now
Is they're trying to get a piece of that
Casual market that Nintendo seems to have
Kind of a hold of
I think what's more interesting
Is
What's Sony gonna do?
You know, because they want to get into the casual market
As well, and we haven't heard too much about
What they're gonna do
And there were rumors a long time ago about new controllers
And stuff like that
That they're gonna do something too
Who knows?
We'll see
In the meantime, we know this game is coming out
But it's been getting a facelift
And a lot of people were like
Cool, that's gonna be awesome
When Beer Pong
Did you hear about this? It was frat party games
Beer Pong
It was gonna be coming out for WiiWare
Like an actual Beer Pong game
Who doesn't love Beer Pong at their local frat party?
Apparently, the game was rated T
So what happened? The game was completely
Reworked
It was rated M
And now they gotta rate it T
So all the
References to booze were taken out of the game
And now the game is Pong Toss
Pong Toss
Instead of Beer Pong
You get Pong Toss, but you know, whatever
I think either way the game's gonna gotta be hokey
I mean, if you're gonna play Beer Pong, fuck it, play Beer Pong
You don't have to play it on your Wii
Or if you're 21 and over only, please
If you really do wanna play it on your Wii
Just, there's a game out right now
Called Game Party
It's like 20 bucks
And it sucks
I mean, I think it sucks compared to everything else
So if you really wanna play this, you can probably find that game
For dirt cheap
So just buy that
I don't know
I will
We'll see
How much is that? This one's supposed to be on the marketplace?
Do we know? Probably like 5 or 10 bucks
5, cause, we'll see
10 is way too much for that
Okay, now we're gonna get to the mailbag part of the program
This is the part where you can send in your emails
Every week to mailbagorangelandtrader.com
And we read them live on air for our amusement
And to poke fun at you
No, just kidding, but if you ask a good question, we'll answer it
So let's open up the old mailbag, Dark Sakura
See what the listeners have to say
Wii has letters
But only three
Four, sorry
Short mailbag
Well, we got a letter from Rob with two B's
Yay, Rob with two B's
It says, this is mostly for Skye and Loki
Because DS dropped me already
I did not drop you
I'm telling you right now, I did not drop you
That's Dan's friends list
I was using Dan's friends list with him for a while
And he has removed people that he does not know
So that was not me, it was my husband
Is this an Xbox Live thing?
Yes
I did not drop you
I did not drop you
I know, it makes it sound like we dropped him
Like a two dollar hooker, and that's not the case
Drop the bomb
It's not that I want to be dropped
But rather that I don't play many online games
The only decent but humbling online play
Was with Rob and friends on Halo 2
Whenever I play online, I get overwhelmed by radical and social epithets
So there's little incentive to go online
If I ever become a big online game player
In a particular game that one of you has
I may re-request later
Also my second Xbox 360 died
So I haven't played anything on it for a while
By the way
I do have my own gamertag
I don't use it, but as soon as I remember what it is
I'll let you know
And I won't delete you
On an unrelated note
Did you try to switch your controller assignment from 1 to 2
When fighting Screaming Mantis
On Metal Gear Solid 4, hilarity ensues
I personally didn't enjoy the
Swap to disc 2 joke
Because the loading to hard drive screens
Are more painful than swapping discs
What a dang good point
What a good point Rob brings up
Is that, you know, don't joke about the disc swapping
Thing and the whole, this is blu-ray
When the game has a freaking install
Good point
And I don't see the need to delete Rob
But hey, look, that one game of Halo 2
Is more than I've played with some people
And that was fun
I had no idea
Blame Dan
I blame him for everything
Alright, good job
This is from
Actdeft
Hi, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican Actdeft
First of all
I have lots of friendly neighborhood Mexicans actually
First of all
Congrats to your 6th anniversary
Which I unfortunately missed
And a belated congrats to Rob for his birthday
Which I'm getting Rob a present soon
Thank you
A late present
Second
Thanks to Rob for remembering me when he
Interviewed Tommy Tallarico and asking him
At Video Games Live we'll return to
Mexicali
That was a pretty good interview by the way
And it's good to hear he cares for the fans too
And well I think that's all
Thanks and ciao
Yeah it was a long interview but
He's definitely
Passionate and has
He's definitely doing a lot for the video game industry
I was kind of surprised
You know I kind of thought
He was a little more on the
Hands off journalist reporting end
But he does a lot more hands on than you might know
At first especially if you're
Especially if you're basing his opinion of him
Or if you're basing your opinion of him strictly off of the
Judgment Day show
Then you're really missing out, that's one thing I learned
This email is sponsored in part by
Konami, home of Neverending Lawsuits
This is Deftest Kebrown
I see what you did there
Okay
Well dun dun dun
From Jonathan
Dear OLR, I have been a long time listener
And have been tuning into your show for a little
Over two years now, wow
This is my first time writing to you guys
And oddly enough I am typing this from the
Wii internet browser since my computer practically
Died on me
Wow, emailing from Wii? Impressive
My game systems have come in handy during these months
And I think
I think it is a blessing that they allow us
To do more than just game
2 as well as many of your other listeners
Use my PSP to get my weekly fix
I don't think that you guys do just one
Should do just one
Big show, I mean it could be great
Having it all at once
But at the same time as Rob points out
We could have spread it out during the week
As of late
I have found the delays
Of part B to be annoying
But I understand that things happen, I'm not fussing at Rob
But try to get it in on Thursday
Or Friday instead of Saturday or Sunday, oh well
We've addressed that
And hopefully, I know he says he likes having it in two parts
But I think the whole
Split thing, Ultra Army and the whole
Combined thing, we'll try it out
If the listeners don't like it, we'll change it back
Well anyway I guess this should count from my
Fe of the week, but regarding the limited
Friends list on Xbox Live, I think
That this is total bull
People can't be limited to how many friends they can have
To game with, and I think that should be
Part of the next dashboard update
I should, no
I know all of your
I know all about your
Problem Rob, I am on Loki's friends list
Though if you need to contact me
Okay
Also for any OLR listeners who would like to add me
My gamertag is unfoldedraptor
Jamie I'm sorry if my email
Is a bit long for such a great show
There is so much to be said, oh thank you
Keep up the great work
And don't stop believing from Jonathan
Florida, home of the never ending supply of dying
Elderly
Nice
That's a little bit horrible
But nice
The last email is for me
Dear Jamie, I know I'm a
Dear
Thank you so much for choosing Ristar, one of my
Favorite classic games of all time
As the classic game of the week
I feel bad for not being present that evening
But I'm really sorry if I made you angry
But being able to listen to it on the podcast
Was good enough for me
And made my day to say the least
Hi
Sorry
That email reminded me to check something else out
Yes Rob
It is a pity that the audio wasn't working
So to make up for it and my absence
I will send a few separate emails with attached
Zip files that contain all of the great songs
From Ristar, including my favorite
Shooting Ristar and Ring Rink
Which are songs that
Play in Act 1 of Planet Florida
And Act 1 of Planet Freon
Thanks again Osfer, P.S. you win the world
Well sadly I'm a little lazy
To open up your files and open up the
Massive MP3's but the good news is
That YouTube appears to be working
Tonight so here's a little bit of
What you missed out on last week if I can
Get a little clip here of the
Actual gameplay
And if you want to hear more about this game go listen to last week's show
That it for email?
That be all
Alright if you want to email us
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
Meanwhile back to the game news
Yes
Well
I don't know what I should really say about this
It's weird
And uh
Alright well anyways
Nintendo has unveiled a brand new
I guess
I don't know if it's a franchise but
Game called
Rainbow
And it's uh
Sounds awesome
It's a really strange looking game
It kind of looks a little bit like
Viewtiful Joe
It combines um
I guess a mix of action exploration
And uh
Manga-esque visuals
And what's kind of neat about the whole game
At least um
What they've said so far is that it's filled
With like B characters
From different games
Like for example in the trailer that they had on
Wiifolder.com
You see Birdo in there
Like talking in Japanese and stuff
But it's a bunch of weird characters
So uh
So wait wait it's a brand new IP that borrows from all the other IPs
Sort of yeah
Which is characters they hope you don't remember
Yeah and the main character is
This like dude who turns into Captain Rainbow
This
I don't know
Rainbow
It's weird looking
And uh I guess
He has a yo-yo attack
Now you know
What's more awesome than Captain Rainbow
Reading
Rainbow
I just want to put that out there
Wouldn't a Reading Rainbow video game be awesome?
One of the other characters I guess was in there
As well as the golfer from NES Golf
That's kind of rare
Wasn't that just Mario?
Interesting
Anyhow
More franchises
This is a good thing though
They're not just borrowing from all the other old games
Capcom is starting a new one as well
It's an Xbox Live Arcade game that's coming out
It's called Flock
Flock is a flocking puzzle game
That is apparently
It's got to do with like you're in this grid style thing
But you're a UFO
And you heard these animals
And apparently the animals have effects
That are affected by
Certain parts and levels and the puzzle aspects
Apparently this game is supposed to be
Kind of like Lemmings
Over 50 different stages, co-op online play
And a way to edit your own levels in the game
Should be pretty neat
This is supposed to be their secret project that they were unveiling at E3
It doesn't look that cool
To be honest
Here's a little clip
I know video doesn't work that great over the radio
But at least you can hear a little of the music
Aw it looks cute
Their little sheath
They're hurting everywhere with the UFO
It looks like a cross between like Kirby Golf
And Lemmings
I'll still play the trial if nothing else
It might be cool, you never know
Remember folks, dead raisin wee
Because they keep saying that's not going to happen
But we know better
What a flocking interesting announcement
Alright so
Yeah, Flock coming soon to
Xbox Live Arcade
That sounds fascinating
Especially with the little sheep, that was cute
I like the little cheepy sheep
Well, some other happy news
And it looks like they're not at all I guess that
Daunted by the lawsuit
But EA was planning on releasing
Two new drum kits for Rock Band 2
And
There will be
A
Velocity sensitive
Drum pad
And it won't be as noisy
And it will have reinforced metal
Pedals
And clip on cymbals
And the second one is actually licensed by
Ion
And it's called the Ion Drum Kit
It's a fairly expensive one
But there are electromagnetic cymbals
And adjustable pads
And metal frame
And it's supposed to be really sweet
And expensive
There are going to be add on cymbals
For the Rock Band drums
Hmm, interesting
Um, you know
If people will pay like 300, 400 bucks
For those arcade style Beat Media 2DX
And Poppin Music controllers though
Why not pay a lot of money for these Ion
Super Duper drum sets
Although I don't know where the F in my house
I would put them
Except out here in the garage, for real?
I thought the wife hated the drums
Well they're at work
Ah, I see
Boy, you're a real sucker for those peripherals
What about you, Dark Soccer? Speaking of suckers for peripherals
You've seen the vault!
I know, are you going to get these?
Just because I want them doesn't mean I'm going to buy them
They're 300 dollars, I mean shit
That's expensive
For 300 dollars, do you know how many days you could feed
A starving child somewhere in the world?
Probably a year
Yeah, why would I want to feed children?
Why feed children?
Unless they're going to build me a kick ass drum set
You could be playing Billy Idol
In Rock Band 2
It's a nice day for a
White wedding
Anyhow
It's a nice day for some more gaming news too
Alright
How many times have we heard this rumor
That there's going to be an announcement
During the Nintendo conference
That's going to unveil
Animal Crossing Wii
I know
I think, are we really going to be shocked if it
Gets announced?
Yes, because it's like OMG it's finally here
The more the shock is
Is it going to look like
It's going to actually be kind of different
And more interesting than the DS one
I'm guessing they're not innovating on shit
Since they didn't innovate on hardly
Anything from the DS and
GameCube ones
I wouldn't be surprised
I'll still buy it because I'm a consumer whore
Me too
The other rumor that's coming out
Is Punch Out for the Wii
That's kind of a rad surprise
Like that was one of the things you didn't really think
Of that, but that makes sense
If Wii Boxing was so big, why not
Throw in the beloved Punch Out characters
Mr. Dream
Mike Tyson
George Foreman
Put him in the game
I guess, we need to fucking Excite Truck 2
Fuck this Punch Out shit
We'll see
The news conference is only days away
So we'll see
We'll see
Well here's what I'm worried about
Because Nintendo, they have a trend
Of following stupid ideas sometimes
With the whole Wii Wheel
And the Wii Zapper
It was just like
Hey the Wii Wheel, people buy those stupid
Third party wheels because they want to pretend
That they have a steering wheel because they can't
Use their imagination
Let's put one out too
Hey, they can't imagine that it's a gun
It would look like a gun
What are we going to have with the fucking boxing gloves or something?
I mean seriously
There's going to be some really retarded stuff
Coming out I'm sure
There'll be storage dammit! I want my storage
You know what this show
Needs you guys
Before we wrap it up and take some calls
And get out of here for the night
You know what this show needs? More Journey
That's right
We have some Journey news for you guys tonight
But it's kind of
Kind of a little bit saddening
About this particular Journey news
Actually apparently
Steve Perry who used to be the front man
For Journey
He did an interview this week with GQ
Magazine and you can actually read it online
At men.style.com
And he actually talked about
The Journey arcade game
And if you've never played the arcade game
Run, do not walk
To Mame and check this out
Yes it's a cheesy game but
For it's time period it was awesome
Because the actual cabinet
Would play the song separate ways
On tape
When you beat the game you were at a Journey concert
And separate ways would play on tape and it was awesome
And then the aliens would kidnap all their instruments again
However Steve Perry
Says oh no no no
I never thought we should have done the game
He's being your typical rock snob
He says everybody went against me on that issue
Because I thought it was silly
I've come to find out there's a generation of kids
Who think it's classic and wish they could find the arcade version
But I personally thought it was kind of dumb
Hmph
And then you get this
As if the ego wasn't big enough
See it's funny because I thought that we were big already
That we didn't need a video game
But that's just how the world judges you
Like gee whiz you have a Lamborghini so you must be big
I didn't understand that
Whatever
Like seriously go watch some of your own 80's music videos
And yeah then come back to me
Come back to me and talk
I still love Journey though
And I still love Steve Perry even if he's a rock snob
Who kind of said a dumpy thing this week
Journey's still awesome
Don't let anybody tell you different
Right Dark Sakura?
Right!
And and and and
And the ferret
Alright
Before we close out the show tonight
We have to get some calls
We have to pay respect to our elders this week
By revisiting the classics
And we have for you guys
If Jamie doesn't drop her microphone much more
We have for you a trip down memory lane
With this the classic game of the week
And apparently
Dark Sakura's opting for
Like a classic of classics
Like a just freaking like
I don't want to say obvious choice
But just a choice
That had to be here eventually
Had to
Right? Absolutely
So what did you pick for the kids tonight?
Chrono Trigger
Of course
Also it's because Sauce suggested it too
Oh I was going to speculate maybe it was tied into the recent
Announcement of the DS conversion
That's part of it too
I had to play like the best music in the game
This is like my favorite music in the game
My second favorite music in the game
Let's hear a little louder what is this?
It's the old palace music
Awesome
Alright go ahead
Anyway it was
A role play game that came out on the
Super Nintendo
Super Famicom
It was released in Japan on March 11th 1995
And August 22nd 1995
In North America
It actually has
I think it's great they mention this
Square's dream team
Was behind it which was
Hironobu Sakaguchi
And
Nobuo Uematsu
Also
The main artist behind the characters
Was Akira Toyama
Who did the Dragon Quest series
And we better know for Dragon Ball
And Dr. Slump
Now remember
Water summons wind and wind makes fire dance
And
So
A lot of the musical score
Was done by Yasunori Mitsuda
Who
Actually passed on his duties
To Uematsu when he fell ill
So
But a lot of the way
That this game played
Is that
It was sort of an action
Slash sort of turn based RPG
You could totally avoid some of the battles
Because you'd see the enemies hanging out
But if you wanted to
Go into the battle you'd like
You would run up to the creatures they would spot you
And then your battle sequence would start
And the style is actually sort of
Reminds me of later on in the Evolution series
Did you ever play that?
Evolution and Grandia?
Not really I think I've seen it but not really played it
I've seen some of the elements came in
But it was also very much though
The Secret of Mana incorporated some of the same stuff too
Where
You would see your enemies instead of having
Just a random
You know, encounter
And you would have
Everyone had hit points, they would have magical weaknesses
But the really cool thing about this
And this is actually called
The Active Time Battle System
Which
Actually was designed
For Final Fantasy 4
Which we had up here is 2
Where you have a personal timer
That's based on
Your character speed statistic
And you also get text
This is your magic attack but the good thing about them
Is that you could
Combine your text with other people
Once you
Use them enough and
You would have like for example the
Antipode attack so it was the fire and ice attack
Remember that?
And you get different levels of those
Or the
I just remember Frog's giant bouncing frog
That was awesome
That's actually in this clip too
Later on
Dude this person
Played through the entire freaking game and it's all on YouTube
Like 120 some odd parts
It's huge
Like 15 minutes a piece
Ultimaga weapon
Well the other
The other really neat
Like another example by the way
It was combining Chrono Cyclone Tech with Lucas
Flame Toss to create Flame World
As their attack
Also the other cool thing
Is because you would guess by
Using Chrono in the title that it has to do with time
It did have time travel
You could go to the same place
In time
And for a while you'd only have like certain
Ways that you could do it
But as you progressed you eventually got a ship
That would let you go through time
And you would do
Different things through different parts
Of the game and the best thing about it was
New Game Plus
Where you would start your game
Over with everything intact
Except for
The special equipment
That were part of the storyline to find
Like the Masamune
The characters in it
You had Chrono who was like your main guy
And his was the
The lightning based attack
I do believe
And then you had
Luca, you had Marle
You also had a bonus character
Which was Magus
But you can either
Keep him or let him go depending on whatever you said to him
You also had
A bajillion different endings in this
And to refer to the
The actual
Super Nintendo version, sorry
You actually do believe that you had
Fourteen endings I want to say
So it was actually
Fairly sweet
Including one where you get to hang with the developers
Which is kind of cool
That one was my favorite just because
Sorry about that high pitch noise, that's the game they're transporting right now
But um
It was just
The game was epic
And there was a Playstation release
That had I do believe
An extra dungeon in it
And also another ending
Plus it had animated cut scenes
In it
As far as the
Original release
It actually did have
Some pretty interesting
I guess innovations to the cartridge itself
There was however a bit of controversy
That an
Unfinished version of the game
Had a ROM linked up
On the internet
Back in 95
That had
Music that was not used in the game
And a dungeon called the singing mountain
And another
Character that
There were other sprites for characters
That never were used
I wonder if we'll see that in the DS
Well um
I do want to say that I think
That level
Was used eventually
But I never played the Playstation version
So I'm not, don't quote me on that one
And also Chrono Cross was
A true sequel to it
In one of the
Anime cut scenes
That was for Chrono Cross
It led up to Luca
Finding a kid for
Sorry for Chrono Trigger, it led up to Luca
Finding a kid for Chrono Cross
It was sort of interesting
It's rumored also
That Chrono Trigger is supposed to be coming
On to
Virtual console
There is going to be a DC
DS sorry, DS release
Which in my opinion
Means the Virtual Console 1 won't happen
Why would they only make $15 off the Virtual Console 1
When they can charge $35.40 for the DS 1
Unless they're going to innovate something
But it looks so far
The trailer is actually up at ChronoTrigger.jp
Or.co.jp
So you can see it looks just the same
But there was another
Project that I don't know if you had ever heard of
Called Chrono Resurrection
I think we covered it on the show a while ago
But yeah, it looked awesome
And basically they were
Redoing the whole thing in 3D
And Squenix did release
Cease and Desist
There are supposed to be ROM hacks
Out there
But
As to where you can find them
If someone can find them, let me know
There's also plenty of good music
There's actually
An acid jazz
Soundtrack release called Frank of Time
It's actually really good at listening to music
There's also
Play Concerts had some
Chrono Trigger music in it
And of course there's the regular soundtrack
And of course you can find
There's an album called
Time and Space, a tribute to
Yasunori Mitsuda
And Chrono Symphonic
Which was released by Overclock
Wow
Lots of stuff on Chrono Trigger
Lots of fan art
I had a thought, you know how the rumor was going around
That the Final Fantasy 11 folks are
Supposed to be working on a new MMO
That's not Final Fantasy, what if it was
Some type of Chrono Online
RPG, I bet it would work
The Satellaview had a release
A spin-off game
Called Chrono Trigger Jet Bike
Special, which is a mini-game
The whole racing scene that I hated
In Chrono Trigger
There was also
A 16 minute OAV
It was called
Numa no Monja
Time and Space Adventures
Which was
I actually downloaded it today
But I watched it all on YouTube earlier
It's very silly, but it's got
Some funny stuff in it
It's actually pretty cute
Radical Dreamers
Was
Like a
Scenario version
That was a side story to Chrono Trigger
That came out on Satellaview on X-96
So
There you go
Alright, your classic game of the week
Been a long time coming
Chrono Trigger
For the Super Nintendo and soon to be a bunch of others
PlayStation I guess you could say
And soon to be the DS
Who knows, maybe someday if people get what they want
Virtual Console, there you have it
Alright, now we are going to go
And take your calls on the Skype line
At 1877
Game OLR, username on Skype
However, quickly
Before we take calls, I want to say tonight
We really want to hear your predictions
For E3
Especially like Wild One, don't name things that have already been
Somewhat confirmed, but what are your
Kind of predictions for E3 tonight
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
It's the one and only Ravenstaufen
Well, hello one and only Ravenstaufen
How you doing?
Are you heading out to PAX to represent Deadpix Alive?
Loserly will
Oh, not you, well that's too bad
But ok, at least you got some representation
Hey, we're asking everybody tonight
What are your predictions for E3 this year?
What do you think is going to happen?
I think Reggie is going to come out and just announce something insane
He's just going to pull down his pants and say
Here it is
I don't know about that
I think there might be
Laws against him doing that in public
No really, anything game related
That maybe hasn't been touched on
That you think we'll see at E3?
Or that you want to see?
You know what, I'm probably going to be the only one
Here, and I'm
Going to predict Wii Fit 2
Wii Fit 2, this early
Really, I would think if we're going to get Wii Fit 2
We'd hear about next E3, but that's just me
Or some expansion of Wii Fit
Because it's good, don't get me wrong
It's really good, but it's slim
So they need to put something out now
What do you think though
If Animal Crossing and Punch-Out
Are their big flagship games for the Christmas season?
Dude, Punch-Out
Punch-Out with the
Balance Board would be hot
It would be kind of fun
It would be nice
BlackWolf says they're going to announce when they actually put more Wii Fit
On shelves, I still can't find one
Me neither, I tried to look for it when I bought
Civ Rev Lucian and they didn't have it
I lost 20 pounds
On Wii Fit
Really?
See, ever since my pancreas issues, I've lost 30 pounds
And I'm just thinking, God, how much more could I lose
If Wii Fit got in the picture, you know?
Crazy
Anything else, any other predictions for E3 this year?
Not really
Just that
Just mostly, Sony's going to probably announce
Probably an internet browser
For the, I mean
A radio
A radio for the PS3, because that would be nice
That would be nice, more listeners for us
I am all for these independent
Applications and ways to get the
Independent radio out there
Down with corporate radio, boo
One more thing
I did get the iPhone 3G
And it's nice and fast
Dark Soccer, you should get
Shazam for your iPhone
What's Shazam?
Does it have anything to do with Captain Marvel?
It does nothing to do with Captain Marvel
Basically, it listens to
Say you're listening to a song
And you have no idea what it is
And the iPhone will listen to that song
And tell you what it is
That's kind of cool, that's like some of those Verizon phones
Yeah, I've heard about the Verizon thing, that's kind of neat
I've got a real obscure song that I need a title to
So, I may have to hit that up
Wait, wait, wait
You may have a usefulness for an Apple product?
Well, I've tried those other services
That listen to the song
And they can't figure it out
Interesting, I bet you
It probably only works with well known songs
This is obscure enough, but we'll see, you never know
That's why there's this radio station
The one radio station I will listen to
In town, is completely DJ free
And it plays the music I like
Which is like 90's, 80's and
Today music, but it's all kind of alternative-y
But at the end of every song
They say the name and the artist
There's no DJ's on the network, but there's this little robotic
Voice that will say, for instance,
Today I heard Duran, Duran
The Reflex, which is awesome
The Reflex
It's an awesome radio station, I gotta say
Which is funny because it used to be the dentist office music station
But now it's pretty awesome
Anyway, any other quick thoughts? We gotta go
Yeah, one more thing
One more thing, last thing
The remote for the iPhone
To control your iTunes is great
That one is my favorite app
I like the application called Flashlight
Because I imagine you push a button
And it just turns your screen white
Flashlight
It sure is, and I haven't tried that yet
iPhone is a flashlight, you can use that
How about an OLR app?
We need an OLR app on iPhone stat
Are you working on it?
You are not working on it
Someone work on it for us, and bring our text-based game to
To iPhone, we need
iPhone Zork
Alright, we gotta let you go, we want more predictions
Take care, buddy
Good luck with Dead Pigs Alive
Hi, you're on Orange Line Radio, who's this?
Hey, hey, it's Ronneman from New York
You have been on the show too damn much recently
How was the flight back, good?
Yeah, there was a slight issue getting back
But we'll save that for another time
Alright, fair enough. Hey, what are your predictions for E3?
I believe I told you that last week
And I'll say it again
Reggie Fils-May will come out on stage
And not just cockslap everyone
With his Wii as Raven Dolphin said
He will announce Star Fox
With twin sticks using the
Wiimote and nunchuck
I could go for that
There hasn't been any Star Fox
Lovin' on the Wii, I could go for that
That's a realistic prediction
Hell yes
Anything else? What about the other systems
You Nintendo fanboy? What about Xbox and
Sony World?
Since they're doing this 60 gig thing
I see them coming out saying
To everybody who bought a 360
In the past three months is getting a $50
Rebate check and they're going to
Announce 60 gig hard drives
For pickup because I'm running out of
Space in my 360
I doubt you on that one
I think that goes with one of those early adopters technology
You just get screwed
You know what though, I still have the 20 gig and I'm doing fine
But I don't download movies or any of that stuff
And I don't rip a lot of music
And I uninstalled Final Fantasy XI
So I have most of my space, you know?
We have Guitar Hero and Rock Band
In the house, so yeah
One of those two, I don't download everything
But I download enough
I will say though it is getting full
But I've been just deleting arcade trials
That I don't really use and I'm
I usually got enough room
But at least it's got a
Decent amount of space unlike a
Certain other system which won't be named
Which would be my prediction
If you ask me my prediction for E3
I do think
Our friends, Reggie Fils-May
Is going to come out and address that issue and make that other guy
From Europe look like the jackass he is
I hope, I hope
That's please plausible, I actually believe
That one more
The next conference will be on Xbox.com
And it will probably be on Microsoft's site
They normally feed those
I want to say if I remember right
And I apologize if I misappropriating this
Because I'm going to be talking about someone else's show
But I watch Twitter and I follow other podcasters on Twitter
I want to say Gamertag Radio
Is running the Xbox conference
Of course, because you know, Gamertag, hello
But I think they're running the Nintendo one too
On their site, so check it
Awesome, I might definitely do that
Yep, alright
We got to get more prediction calls, okay
Cool, no problem, later guys
Bye Jamie
What, no bye for Matt?
Whatever
I love you Loki, you alright man
Alright, take care
That was pretty good, I got to say
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hi
Hey, you're dropping out there a little bit bud
Make sure you got everything else shut off
On your internets
That's alright
Alright, give it a try, quickly
What are your predictions for this year's E3?
Identify yourself too, who are you?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to say Gold Banjo
Well hello Gold Banjo, what are your predictions for E3 this year?
Okay
Well, I'm hoping for maybe an F0 Wii
But I don't know if it'll happen
That is a mighty fine prediction
And it may be a little bit fanboyish
But I'm with you on that
Because I still will play F0 on the GameCube
F0 GX, I love F0
Like, that is one of my favorite racing series, I love it
And GS68
And what Rama said, I guess I'm hoping for that too
All the predictions so far are pretty good
I don't know how many of them we'll see
But I'm excited about it
GS68 in chat says F0 is a dead series
I hope to hell you're wrong
I hope you're wrong, because I don't know about you Loki
Aren't you a big F0 fan too?
I was only the last one, it was alright
The problem with the arcade one, the only problem I had with the arcade one was the fact that
It only had four tracks
But my god, the GameCube and the way it linked together was awesome
And just, oh man, I just
Only problem was finding an arcade cabinet
Is what?
Finding an arcade cabinet
Yeah, yeah, true true
Well, any other quick predictions?
A lot of our callers are jumping right to Nintendo
What about Microsoft and Sony camps?
Anything you got there?
Um, I don't have a PS3 or a 360
So who cares? Fuck them, right?
Yeah, one more thing about the F0 thing
Sure sure
On the F0, you know the F0 expansion pack, right?
For that cancelled add-on for the N64
Oh right, huh?
They had a car and track editor
But yet they never added that into GX when it came out
Maybe I would hope that they would add that for the Wii
And maybe some track and car sharing and stuff
That'd be awesome
That'd be pretty cool
I'm gonna go play some F0 GameCube tonight
Oh
I got my GameCube controller for Mega Man
I got a new memory card for the Mega Man game when I bought it
Now I'm itching to play some F0
So thanks a lot
That's all good
Alright, we gotta let you go buddy
Take care and happy E3
Yep, you too, bye
Alright, bye bye
If you wanna give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR
username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
Hey, this is Akdeft
Hey Akdeft, I love your icon on Skype
By the way, it's a little Kirby chef
It's awesome
And it looks like it's eating something
Is it inhaling a cupcake? I can't tell
It's awesome though
What's your predictions for E3, sir?
I have two
One Nintendo related, another Sony one
Let's give it some variety
Let's hear your Sony one first
Because everyone's done Nintendo right off the bat
Okay, my Sony one is
Sly Cooper 4 for the Playstation 3
Or maybe a PSP game
A what for the PS3?
Sly Cooper
Oh, okay
Sly Cooper
Cool, okay
So some game announcements
I definitely hope that it's going to be announced
It's a far shot
Any reason why you're going for Sly Cooper?
Well, definitely
Maybe because mainly
Excuse me
Because I'm a fan of the series
So I really hope that this time
It's going to be announced
No reason you can't have a little fanboyism
In your predictions, what about Nintendo?
A new Kirby game for the Wii
And so your icon's not just a clever icon
Yeah, a Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool
Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately
A new Kirby game for the Wii would be kind of cool
Although it doesn't seem like Kirby's been living on the DS lately
Well
The Kirby franchise needs a new
A definitely new game
Like a lift-off
That Kirby drawing game
On the DS
Might be kind of fun on the Wii
I actually liked that game quite a bit
I don't remember, did it touch All-Stars or something?
I liked that game, it was fun
Yeah, one of my predictions on the forums
For this year was going to be a port
With using that same gameplay
So I hope that Nintendo announces this on E3
Alright, we'll see
Akdeft, any other quick last thoughts before we get to some more predictions?
No, just thanks on the question for Tomotaro Rico
Hey, no problem
Hey, this show is not just about the three of us
It's about the listeners
When we can ask questions that we know our listeners don't want to hear
We ask them
Alright, take care buddy
And I hope it does get back to them, by the way
I think this will be our last call
Then we're going to call it a night because we're running pretty long
Hey, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
DS68
Well hello, you got through
What's your predictions for E3, buddy?
The employees of Konami and Harmonix duke it out
Over the whole Rock Battle lawsuit
And it's a myth that an arcade game gets announced at E3 and the whole universe dies
So are you suggesting that Konami should bring back their Rumble Roses models
From a few E3s ago
And they can duke it out in Cream Corn or Jello Wrestling?
No, I was joking
I wasn't
Maybe, like you and some other cars have said
Maybe Nintendo will address the storage space
To some sort of attachment to the Wii
That applies to the USB drive or something
Yeah, just a patch that they could release overnight
That will let the USB drives work
I don't know, call it a hunch
Also, freaking Super Mario RPG gets it released on Virtual Console
Ah, now there's a good fanboy prediction
Super Mario RPG on Virtual Console
We know it's coming eventually, right?
We heard the Japanese one
So you would think if it's coming out in Japan
It's got to come out here eventually
So we'll see
Any other predictions, sir?
What about the Sony and Microsoft end of things?
Well, I don't really know because
The only next-gen console I was at was the Wii
I don't feel like I lost somebody for 360 or PS3 at the moment
How about, I'll give you a fanboy one
Because I would love to see this someday
How about a company announces in partnership
With either Microsoft or Sony
A localized version of Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune
For consoles?
No, I don't know
That game seems like the kind of game that they're playing in arcades
The PS3 version of Wangan Midnight sucks balls
Well, because it's a different thing
It's not related to the actual arcade series
That game's based off the arcade series
But the problem is though
It's a port of a PlayStation 1 game, I think
No
Well, because it's based on
It and the original Wangan Midnight arcade game were based on Tokyo Extreme Racer for the PS2
Or Dreamcast
So the magic just belongs in the arcades
It doesn't need to be brought home
Yeah, some things in the arc
I mean, that's what the arcade needs
More things that you can only experience in the arcade
I mean, these days you can just easily port shmups and fighters to the consoles and PCs
Fair enough, I'll give you that, sir
Alright, we're gonna wrap it up, GS68
But thanks for the call, have a good one, okay?
You too
Alright, later
We will see what happens at E3
It all starts this week
It's gonna be awesome
In the meantime though, we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts
And wrap up the show tonight
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
Think for yourself and learn to be offended
My final thought is
I want a Hot Pocket
Loki
My final thought is I have a bunch of last minute stories
Oh yeah, we never get to last minute stories, I'm sorry
Alright, last minute stories then, quickly
Okay, real quick
Madden soundtrack's coming to Rock Band's download content
I guess that's kinda cool
Did I leave that off the showroom? My bad
Yeah
I'm a dummy, alright
Oni-chanbara, that game with the chicken lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting zombies with a samurai sword
Is coming to the Wii in the US now
Fuck yeah, that's awesome
Here's one of my predictions to come out of E3
That there's gonna be a software patch for the Wii that will allow you to use the Wii classic controller
Or perhaps this brand new trademark patented controller that Nintendo will be putting out
To be used with GameCube games
Instead of having to actually have a GameCube controller
That makes sense
Because they now have a new thing that looks like a very blocky version of a GameCube controller
That's kind of interesting
Lots of rumored Xbox Live Arcade games to be coming out tomorrow through next week
Including, there is a game by Bungie that's supposedly gonna debut on Xbox Live Arcade tomorrow
There's also a rumor that they're gonna surprise us with Geometry Wars Retro Vault 2
That might be the surprise thing tomorrow
There are a couple other games that they mentioned as well, including, I don't know where to go here
There is some other like crosswords game that's gonna be coming out
Which I don't know, that didn't look too exciting at all
They did announce that though, that's really happening
Yeah, that's really happening
And there was also some other game, a shooter game, Shred Nebula
That's actually gonna be coming out
Dude, I would not want to be crappy crosswords game in the week that Duke Nukem or Geometry Wars 2 or these other rumored things get released
Exactly
There's one thing I do know
There was an article, it was actually this week, about Blazing Lizard
I guess they're being represented by Flash Man Studios
And you may not know who Blazing Lizard is
But they're the ones behind Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball on Xbox Live Arcade
And they have an unannounced title for the Wii
I know what that game is by chance
And it actually is Pirates vs Ninja Dodgeball
It's coming to the Wii now too
Let's see, there's a pretty cool little game coming out called I Heart Geeks
It's a rude Goldberg puzzle game, kind of like in The Incredible Machine
And apparently there's some leaks out of Sony's support site about upcoming titles
Including Punisher Warzone for the PS3
And Maxim Pinball, Cinnamon Beats, Alien Sports Mini Golf, and Under Fire
Kind of interesting
There's gonna be a new Wolfenstein game at E3 this year
In fact that's already in the new Game Informer magazine
So check that out, it's pretty cool
And also rumored that Rock Band 2's setlist includes Guns N' Roses
And the Chinese Democracy Trek
That would be a pretty awesome little surprise
That could be very interesting
And that's all I really want to talk about right now
Alright
Oh, I'm sorry, one more thing
This is completely random
I saw there was this list that was on game trailers
It's eight extremely embarrassing E3 moments
And the one that they have in the very beginning on here is Jamie Kennedy
Remember his Activision little spiel last year was completely embarrassing
And he wasn't very funny
I actually met Jamie Kennedy this Wednesday
I have a picture with him actually
It's pretty crappy
And I have a new autograph for our autograph wall
Hooray
He's actually pretty funny in person
I need to put the freeze-pop autograph up by the way
That Rama got me for my birthday
And I'm digging that new freeze-pop album actually
It's pretty fun
Good times
Alright, your final thought, Loki
My final thought is I hopefully will finish OLR PSP this week
I know my wife is really hating that I'm working on this
Did you want to change your final thought, Dark Soccer, since it's been so long?
No
And I will agree with Game Guru on a last final thought
E3 better rock
I agree, especially since we're not there to party away
Anyhow, meanwhile, thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting
And supporting Orange Lounge Radio
And just all independent radio with your support

Because we can't invade other all-game show space
But maybe something mid-week, we'll see
