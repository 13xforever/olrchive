Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We are that podcast on the internet, dedicated to video games,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
say hello to the one and only, the lovely, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic Con.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Happy, happy, happy.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So what is this, they're making a new Tron?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Just Tron 2, is all you need to be saying.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And Jeff Bridges is in it.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, I saw that in the trailer.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And he looks evil.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What was up with that trailer though,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, but someone else went back in and tried to zoom in

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and clean it up and get it looking as good as possible,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so you can actually see some more stuff in it.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are they that strict with cameras at Comic Con?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I mean, I would think with millions of people.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's Disney's panel.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,040
I would think that Disney would want to keep it

32
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,840
Well you okay remember any at one of the last t3s that we went to when Kingdom Hearts 2 came out

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,700
Mm-hmm Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed when a vista vista would hmm remember yeah, yeah

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,940
Yeah, I remember that so I would use that as sort of a past precedent

35
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,240
Yeah, but still what are they gonna do? There's like thousands of people at Comic Con

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,400
You know what I mean especially in those panels as far as I can tell though this this cell phone video was the only thing

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,720
That I've seen

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,000
So interesting well whatever they're doing it works, but I've never been to Comic Con

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Maybe next year. I'm going next year the one and only me Glatov. You've probably heard on this show

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,560
He was a comic-con. He was giving me calls pretty much every day

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,060
He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's a jerk intensely

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,920
Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while yeah kind of

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,220
All right speaking of jerks say hello to tech master Loki

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Just kidding

46
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:22,640
Hey, I'm doing fine. Were you just watching a little preview because I was reading up on it

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,040
But you know I didn't know that they actually had filmed it of course you have to assume that

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,760
Anything that says do not film someone's gonna film it so exactly exactly especially something is

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,320
Widely anticipated is that yeah, so hey just think about it

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,440
It'll make a great video game except then again. There was a Tron 2.0 stop anybody do very well

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,640
I think there's they should go ahead and try again

52
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
There's a better the freeware

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,600
or share where a

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,760
Light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while. It's really really good cool

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,800
I remember surround on the Atari 2600 that was just light cycles well remember that

56
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
Anyhow if you want to join us in our chat room

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,840
We are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number

58
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
289 of our podcast damn world

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,320
chat that orange launch radio comm is the place to be if you want to

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,560
join in with the chat, and I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now and

61
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,300
Some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,200
And all that stuff and some people are commenting about how during the previous show the Bobby Black Wolf show on all games radio

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,760
Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was a Bobby Black Wolf show

64
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,080
Some people in there commenting on that if you want to hear that you got to listen to Bobby show though

65
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
He's available at all games calm

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Click on Bobby Black Wolf show

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,160
Alright, let's get into um. How was your gaming week?

68
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,980
We always start off the show talking about our gaming weeks, so how was your gaming week Dark Sakura after the response who?

69
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,400
Ronchon real quick sure he said he handed me he who shall not be named us still beating heart

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
But that means you'd have to have a heart first

71
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,740
Instead of a lump of coal nice like some like the evil Smurfette did

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,160
All right so gaming week

73
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,880
I played stuff actually I did finally start Aurora faint, and that gives freaking cool. I

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,320
Don't know much about this game. Tell us a little bit about Aurora. It's an iPhone game. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, okay? That is

75
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:26,440
It's it's sort of like how will be to help be jeweled does except you can only move them horizontally

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,200
But you can sort of slide as as you destroy groups

77
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,240
They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does when you you know but you can actually move blocks off to the side

78
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,080
And and move them that way move them laterally into empty spaces

79
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,520
So it's sort of a neat a neat thing and you can level up and learn new techniques

80
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,960
and it's a very cool little game and and very pretty and shiny and

81
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,320
I played

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,060
This other thing called color spiral, but all it is is just

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,760
Drawing really awful circles on the iPhone so it sucks, and I got a sudoku game just to try it

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,560
I got it's just called sudoku free and it actually it's kind of neat really you know easy as in

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,020
really easy as in

86
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,000
But it's it's it's pretty the interface is pretty you can choose your color. I've done something similar

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
I've had just this week

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,740
I downloaded coffee time crosswords because I kind of felt obligated as it is a new Xbox Live arcade title to kind of look at

89
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,920
it and

90
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,480
My obligation dried up in about three minutes. I was just like this game is poopy well to answer

91
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
an alpha

92
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,960
Kynanogram

93
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,240
The game was called aurora faint

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,720
Fe int like a battle maneuver. It sounds a little like medios with the whole sideways only movement thing

95
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,460
You'll have to give it a try. You'll have to get a try

96
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,340
You can actually make a character on my phone if you want that's cool or one of these days

97
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,960
I'll finally break down to buy an iPhone one of these days. I hear people are still lining up for that stuff. That's crazy

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
but also um I

99
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,720
I

100
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,940
Downloaded something else. I actually think that I might though try uh I

101
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Was actually this was it. I was about to download miss pac-man and

102
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,520
Apparently it's utter crap, so I didn't do it because

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,920
The there's no real good way to control it um I can imagine

104
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,360
They should do marble madness for iPhone though if they can do monkey ball

105
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,880
They can do marble madness good time, but monkey ball sucks on iPhone. Just letting you know really yes, you have to um

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,160
To play just right instead of holding your phone at a perfect um

107
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,000
Flat angle you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
so it's

109
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
really

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
Not

111
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,640
good

112
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,400
Um I also I did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been because I've been doing a lot of homework

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,280
I did though get some some fantastic nerd time yesterday

114
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Wasn't video game related, but but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it and it pissed me off

115
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,120
What's that?

116
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,800
I watched a whole crap ton of stargate sg1 that is pretty nerdy friend Becky

117
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,640
And I are finally finishing up the fourth season box set

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,680
And I remember how excited I was at e3 when they had the big stargate thing up

119
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,120
And I was like oh hell. Yes. Do you want and then did the game ever come out? No? No?

120
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
canceled

121
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
I

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,360
Was like don't let me take your picture in front of the giant stargate

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,360
I remember that right that was awesome as I love me some stargate except. I do not like stargate at Linda's

124
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:45,480
Okay, not very much. All right before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show any other games um

125
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:53,140
No, all right not that there's anything wrong with a game of life not that there's anything wrong with a nerdy sci-fi

126
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,120
Talk show because we have like pod culture. We know them and like them and

127
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,200
Travis Donovan under station live they kind of do something

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,480
Do it?

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,620
Hi, Travis. All right moving on. Thank you. How was your gaming week?

130
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,620
My gaming week was okay. I played

131
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:16,420
I played Magnetica because I haven't actually tried that yet on the DS, and it was pretty fun

132
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,940
it's sort of like Zuma a little bit, but

133
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,300
They add a few things to actually make it different

134
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,500
So that was kind of neat try to get my wife to play it

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,060
And she said I don't like the way it aims and it that sucks

136
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,260
So I'm not touching it then meanwhile she ends up playing it anyways and then still complains about it

137
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,220
She's been playing super collapse 3 instead

138
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,100
I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and I

139
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,380
got to say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I

140
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:53,180
Don't really care for the new 3d graphics. Especially when they they have all their like most of the cutscenes are in-game

141
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,980
Using the in-game engine and when you get really close to some of those characters man those textures are really low-res

142
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,580
but overall it's it's pretty good and

143
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,960
And then I played also Korg 10 DS

144
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,060
Which isn't really a game, but more of you know an actual piece of

145
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,240
Synthesizer software and so played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10

146
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,260
I didn't really make much with it, but it's fun

147
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,440
It's it'll be cool to play around with and then on a 360

148
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
Of course more Grantham thought of four

149
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,040
I don't really have to say much more about that and

150
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
Also

151
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
Tried out on the Wii

152
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,840
Wario Land shake which just got released in Japan and

153
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,540
It's awesome. It really is it's

154
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,580
You know a perfect example of how they can do really good 2d platform games now with the technology

155
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,040
That's out there all hand-drawn animation. They have anime cutscenes

156
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,120
It's really cool. It really is and sadly enough. If only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game

157
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,520
at e3 they might have actually saved their you know a little press conference, but

158
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
whatever and

159
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,480
Then let's see what else that I play. I think that's about it. Actually. This is pretty brief

160
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,760
Alright, well my gaming week. I also played Final Fantasy 4 quite a bit that pretty much dominated by gaming week

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
You know Final Fantasy 4 is probably

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,600
My favorite maybe either my favorite or my second favorite

163
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,100
I haven't decided but it's one of my favorites of the is fun entire Final Fantasy series

164
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,800
I definitely like it more than any of the PlayStation ones or even Final Fantasy 10 or hell even 12. I

165
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,560
Love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS

166
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,040
It's kind of interesting because the difficulty you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty if you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2

167
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,840
American like I did you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty, you know

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,600
you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and

169
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,520
Just you didn't really have to grind or anything like that. You do need to do a little bit not a lot

170
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,440
I mean that gets annoying in role-playing games. You'll have to do a lot of grinding

171
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,480
You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't you know

172
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,080
Getting completely overpowered by the enemies

173
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,720
You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you the speed of how they're attacking

174
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
You know and all of that you can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game

175
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,880
And it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience. Also, you have the new translation and everything

176
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,100
I really like that they put voice acting in the game

177
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,000
It's kind of neat even though it only shows up in a few select scenes. They actually pull it off on the DS pretty well

178
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,640
It's not a plus level voice acting but it's not terrible

179
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,240
It does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years

180
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,960
My biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki

181
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,840
I don't like the graphics. I don't like the look very much of what they've given the game

182
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,760
It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game

183
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,040
Well, it's like all the cutscene choppy and even thought it feels like even Final Fantasy 7 looked better than this

184
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,880
The cutscenes don't have the same like style of graphics as you know, the actual game itself, you know

185
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,880
The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just like

186
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:20,080
Cartoony, it's not like Final Fantasy 7 where you know, the graphics were kind of cartoony

187
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,400
But the cutscenes the characters were also a bit cartoony as well

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,420
It's just it doesn't match whatsoever. You go with this really like super deformed looking character to like ultra realistic

189
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,280
It's just not I don't know what it is

190
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,380
But I would have almost just preferred redone sprites like I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games

191
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,660
Those games are beautiful and they're still sprite based but they look amazing

192
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,800
You know, I really like the look on those and that's kind of what I've almost wish

193
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,360
This had been and I I see Game Guru and Chad is saying just get Final Fantasy 4 advanced

194
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,240
I mean, yeah, but that was just basically a port with you know, the new translation and and possibly that ramped up difficulty

195
00:12:59,240 --> 00:12:59,440
I mean

196
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,280
I do like some of the other frills in the DS game such as I kind of think that whole

197
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,520
Wit the the extra summon there Rydia has the wit that you can actually customize

198
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,680
I don't know how far you got but once you pick up Rydia and you can't you actually get to Kaipo the desert town

199
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,260
You kind of can play your first, you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons

200
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,600
That will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands

201
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,260
You actually level it up through these silly little DS games like the math game

202
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,720
Which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game. Maybe it's just the nerd in me

203
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,160
I don't know, but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game

204
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,520
I like the whole map thing that they use the bottom screen is basically a map of a dungeon and when you get a hundred

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,540
Percent completion on a map like if you've explored the whole map

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,800
You get like a little bonus

207
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Like maybe an extra tent or an extra Phoenix down something definitely for the completionist in all of us

208
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,720
And I do also kind of like that

209
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,240
You know

210
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,840
It seems like the abilities that were removed in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's prey ability

211
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,440
Cecil's darkness ability these things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters

212
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,180
That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on advance

213
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,640
Maybe with a new translation

214
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,960
I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD based system even ps2

215
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,900
You know, I just think the graphics would have been a lot better. I I just maybe I'm biased or whatever you call

216
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,880
I just don't like the DS for think for projects like this

217
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't like that all these things these redone old classic games are coming out all on the DS because I don't

218
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,360
You know the DS

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,960
Kind of lends itself to a different outside the box kind of game making not so much the translations of old games exactly

220
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,680
I think I'll play this more when it comes out on the PSP when we get like Final Fantasy 3 and 4

221
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,380
I hope I hope it does just like they did 1 & 2 I mean because I liked 1 & 2 I thought well

222
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,680
I didn't really like to that much but I I wouldn't have liked it no matter what system it was on

223
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,400
But Final Fantasy 1 I liked a lot on there and I like the way they did it

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,760
It doesn't have to be all fancy 3d graphics and to be honest, you know

225
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,980
I think they wasted a lot of effort with it because now they have to redo all the characters redo all the scenes and all

226
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,000
That stuff and for what it just looks mediocre

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,120
I don't know and Bobby Blackwell's trying to be cute and chat make a joke. He says confirmed. Oh, LR DS haters

228
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,840
No, I'm not a DS hater. I like the games that are kind of made for a DS like trauma center great game

229
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,540
You can't play that really anywhere else

230
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,480
I mean, I guess you can't on the Wii but that's a whole nother story cooking mama is actually kind of fun on the DS

231
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,360
You know, there's lots of these types of games on the DS even even things like Metroid Prime hunters and stuff that you can't really

232
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,700
Get you know on other types of systems. I don't like

233
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of you know how to control a game

234
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,120
And that's the other thing that's my other big problem with Final Fantasy 4 is that it needs an analog stick

235
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,600
Trying to control Cecil which all these years

236
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,160
I thought it was Cecil but according to the voice acting at Cecil trying to control Cecil in that 3d environment

237
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,040
Where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees it sucks because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little

238
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,820
You know, I don't know about okay

239
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,560
I don't know if if there were other like things that I missed but I you can control the way he runs and stuff

240
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,000
Using the stylus, but I was unable to like interact with anybody

241
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,040
Using the stylus. I had to like stop and push a button which I thought was retarded

242
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,780
You do need to play a little more Final Fantasy 4 and get your wit leveled up so we can do the wireless battle

243
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,260
Because I'm kind of curious how that works

244
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,740
Okay

245
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,920
So play play a little more at least till you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know

246
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,700
How many people I know are gonna get this game?

247
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,520
Although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy fangirl, it's worth checking out

248
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,540
Especially if you've never played the game

249
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,200
You've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great

250
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,400
But if you have played the old games you you know have already kind of made your way through them

251
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,780
I still say it's worth a look. It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper because it's a $40 DS game, but

252
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,260
It's not gonna be a waste of your time. It is, you know, kind of a different experience. So there you have it

253
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,580
And then Bobby and chat commented again. He said confirmed. Oh LR likes to debunk black wolf. Oh

254
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Bobby you're great

255
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:27,460
Game guru says look every port or remake of an nest and super nest for the DS means no PlayStation Network or virtual console

256
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,020
Port and that makes me mad. I kind of I kind of agree

257
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,040
I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2

258
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,920
Uh recreations or any guide because those were great. I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone

259
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,220
I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people but I would like to see a

260
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,080
New approach taken to it. I just kind of don't want it on the DS. I'd like to see it as a

261
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,760
Remade for at least the ps2 if nothing else make it a budget title for the ps2 if nothing else

262
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,440
There'll be tons of people that want it

263
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,520
We'll see also in my gaming week

264
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,640
I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more civilization revolution, which is a game

265
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,240
I think is pretty cool, and I noticed Bobby black wolf was playing Civ revolution speaking of Bobby

266
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,840
He was playing that quite a bit this weekend

267
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,320
So I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on civilization revolution

268
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Even though I'm not that great at the game. He'll probably beat me

269
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it

270
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,400
and

271
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Also, I've been playing that new

272
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,020
Xbox Live arcade game that came out the

273
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,420
The street dancing game whose name I accidentally closed the window. What was it the go-go beat?

274
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,660
Let me look at go go beat steady, I think that was the name of it

275
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,620
I had it earlier. I play I was just you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of go go break steady

276
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,780
that's name it I played it for a little bit and

277
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,100
I

278
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,460
Kind of like the concept. I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this guitar room and style

279
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,920
You know buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside and the better you hit them in rhythm

280
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,500
Then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma and I kind of thought that was cool

281
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,900
It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game

282
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,700
But I know there are people that do get excited for that. So I'm glad there's a decent music video

283
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,700
Music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone. It's worth checking out

284
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:27,520
But I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music

285
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,060
I think it could be kind of cool

286
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
So that's it for my gaming week

287
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,500
Housekeeping tonight before we get into some gaming news honestly don't have a lot just gonna give the same old plugs

288
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,720
We usually do for you know, our Facebook community at facebook.com search for the ol army

289
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,740
You can join us on there at live journal

290
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,860
we are username orange lounge on live journal and we always you know post little plugs for the show or other bonus things we do and

291
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,520
Of course our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com our myspace orange lounge radio and our YouTube channel

292
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,420
Is that orange lounge radio? I believe is our YouTube. It's been a long time as I've logged into I believe

293
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,740
That's orange lounge radio. I've still yet to put my video

294
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,140
Yes, you need to put your video on there and I'm gonna be putting the olr PSAs on there as well

295
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,840
For the folks that want to hear those again outside the show

296
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,900
We're gonna put those on there too, even though there's not a lot of video to go with them. At least it's something

297
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,060
All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Shall we sure? All right. All right

298
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:27,380
All right. Well, you know being that e3 was not really this week, but last week

299
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
There's been a lot of you know

300
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:37,520
Either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it and a couple publishers one being Bethesda

301
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:44,860
has been trying to defend e3 saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit and

302
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,620
You know kind of what they've been saying is

303
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:53,320
You know before it used to be very, you know bustling very lots of people in there

304
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
but now it's just vacant and

305
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,860
You know, not that many people come and visit them and I think Bethesda. I mean, they're not a

306
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,980
small

307
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,100
Publisher by any means but at the same time they're not like I remember when you know you guys visit Bethesda

308
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,540
Their booth wasn't that big not compared to like, you know, EA or you know, Microsoft or something like that

309
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:19,820
So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more it's a lot of people might miss going to visit

310
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,780
you know these smaller publishers that are there so that kind of sucks and

311
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:32,560
Bethesda's booth was interesting though because is basically imagine their booth space was kind of like a donut where they had everything kind of around it

312
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,260
They had some things on display kind of around on the on the actual donut shape

313
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,900
but then in the middle where the donut hole would be was that like kind of special room where they were doing their little press

314
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,940
events and dark soccer and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and

315
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out which that was great

316
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,380
Unfortunately, it was one of those games. It was awesome in theory, but the execution unfortunately by the time the game actually came out

317
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,580
It didn't work out so well, but we got excited about it watching is it was great in theory

318
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,300
I actually taped the whole thing how they recreated the Erathicon battle was pretty awesome

319
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,140
I know that was sweet, but yeah, anyhow, sorry, but but they just say that it needs to change

320
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,460
They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they you know

321
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
want to change it, but I

322
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,100
Don't know, but yay. Yay another

323
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,900
Company also displeased with the current e3

324
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:35,840
Ironically enough though. They're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now

325
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,440
They wish to invite the community to the show

326
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,000
It's a bit ironic when you think about it because they were one of the companies

327
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,360
Complaining that there was too many people at e3 and that they couldn't get any business done

328
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:56,560
So instead they want to go back to where the way it was and then some I seem to remember us bringing up this

329
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,340
Almost exact not not exactly sure if I seem to remember EA making similar comments last week

330
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,160
Although I think this week it was what Peter Moore that said them specifically and you know

331
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:10,040
Which is interesting because he used to be kind of Xbox's, you know spokesperson at those press conferences and things

332
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,040
But it's just interesting. It's not it's not stopping from EA, you know, it's now now here we go

333
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,900
Another person at EA kind of speaking up saying here's gosh

334
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,400
We missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place, but Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got

335
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,480
I don't know they move this way

336
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,260
Okay, and I know a lot of people aren't gonna agree with this cuz you know

337
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,980
They haven't gone to e3 and they want to I don't think that they should let the public into e3

338
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,580
Because as it was it was so fucking packed

339
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
before

340
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,720
You know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts. You're not gonna get anything done

341
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,520
What they need to do is find some happy medium between the old e3 and the new e3

342
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,500
So maybe lacks up the amount of you know

343
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:56,540
People that they're allowing to be invited these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking e3 anymore because it's just too

344
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:02,540
Strict but before I mean there was people like, you know, Walmart employees that work on their garden section

345
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,460
Just because Walmart carries video games. They got in the e3, you know weird shit like that

346
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,700
If they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there

347
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,780
Then I think it would be a little bit better

348
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,580
I

349
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,640
Don't know about adding the public

350
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,140
I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff

351
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,460
I like the format that they have with the press conferences and stuff because it's a lot easier to digest the information

352
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,680
And you know what?

353
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,220
Maybe it might not be so bad with the press conferences there and actually being able

354
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,940
You know since you're not gonna be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's gonna be fucking mobbed

355
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,180
Um, I gotta say this this is very interesting the comments again

356
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,900
I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving good giving us good stuff tonight Bobby in our chat room and chat

357
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,900
I don't want to come he says Peter Moore loved the community

358
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,940
Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiasts press last year when Peter Moore was in charge this year

359
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,420
They didn't really care about us as much and it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very

360
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,060
They're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are you know way more out there with the community

361
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,700
And everything I mean heck you can get an OLR gamer pic on the Xbox live marketplace

362
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,220
You know that's saying something right there if our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world

363
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,400
You know what? I mean? That's you know, it kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community

364
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:20,980
Kind of interesting, but you know, I like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how okay

365
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,420
Let's this was the first year that the we I mean it was coming out that same year and that

366
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,980
And that booth was fucking mobbed. It was just impossible

367
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,540
You couldn't walk through it say you wanted to see a game and you finally did see it

368
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,980
You'd take you like 30 minutes just to get out of the booth and it was just awful

369
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:45,100
And can you imagine adding you'll say I'm not saying double that but can you imagine adding like even another half of that?

370
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:51,680
I mean, I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness it honestly

371
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,820
I don't I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only but make it you know

372
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:04,600
kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in I think that will

373
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,780
Really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, you know

374
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,320
Namely us but it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees

375
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,900
But I do think there should be room to for actual, you know, the game say I definitely deserve a place in there

376
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,900
But you know somehow

377
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,380
Screening us that it's really only the people that really work with games in these places

378
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,900
I I am actually okay with the GameStop employees of America being with their I do think the types of things that EA if you

379
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:39,580
I like educated GameStop employees who've played the games and stuff. I think everybody does so why why not invite retail?

380
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,220
It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know it's like some of these years

381
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,420
It's hard to see everything

382
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:50,760
I think that the way that these do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see

383
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,100
Everything and then you can decide which you need to go see further. I like that

384
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,760
I like that a lot because that works before the gamers days

385
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:05,140
Digest all the information the publishers can make sure that the people that that they have the information that they want out there

386
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,700
And if they want to you know further show it off, you know

387
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,100
Maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes

388
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,500
But you know, hey, this game is playable at our booth. Go check it out, you know, or hey, you know

389
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,900
Let's set up some times to come, you know, visit the booth and play the game

390
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,100
All right. Well, let's move on talking about more e3 kind of fallout because obviously, you know

391
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,540
I know it's been a couple weeks now since e3 but

392
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,780
It is one of the highlights in the gaming year and of course Nintendo

393
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:42,280
Got a lot of flack for their e3 press conference. And what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of

394
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,840
I

395
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,080
Don't know if you want to say they apologized but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception

396
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,160
In fact Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week quote

397
00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:00,240
We are sorry about the media briefings specifically for those who are expecting to see Nintendo show something about Super Mario or Legend of Zelda

398
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,720
If there's any perception that Nintendo is ignoring the core gamers

399
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,040
It's a misunderstanding and we really want to get rid of that misunderstanding by any means so an interesting apology of sorts

400
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,840
But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these kid

401
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,200
Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true

402
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:26,880
I think or at least now it's just I'm saying because all they showed was games for casual people. I mean, no, I hate, you know

403
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,760
Distinguishing games between casuals and you know the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays

404
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,640
But seriously Wii music is like an over glorified toy. There's no depth to it whatsoever

405
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:48,120
It's just crap, but Loki you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chinatown Wars. Now. That is a hardcore game

406
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,840
That's the thing but a logo Loki exactly, but here's that's that's one thing though that got it got me excited

407
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,080
But they don't actually have to show anything just say hey, we're working on this

408
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,560
I mean look at a couple years ago. They were showing off a video for Mario Kart

409
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,640
Wii it didn't come out for two years after that, you know, same with the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess

410
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,040
They had a really early teaser video for a few years prior to that and everyone got hyped up

411
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,820
Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3 all they have to do is say, you know

412
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,480
You know with that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the you know final product. It was great though

413
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,360
It was epic in the making it showed nothing in the endgame the actual endgame footage

414
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,000
But it was epic and theatrical and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3 even though they came out for a while

415
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,960
Mike a Sony God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name

416
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,440
Here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick

417
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,360
I don't remember her name the new one that replaced parent Kaplan or whatever

418
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:52,080
That's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on on there. I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games

419
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,760
I mean, I honestly she may play the DS and play the fucking brain-age shit

420
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,400
And she may be like one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer

421
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,840
but that's the problem those because they don't play these games and they don't necessarily have to play it like a lot of games to

422
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,360
Be it's not their job. It doesn't to make the games

423
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,840
It isn't to make the games but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their you know

424
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,840
audience that's what they should do because

425
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,140
It just seemed like you know

426
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,000
She's a buffoon and so they're having her play this game to make it look like look at this

427
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,320
It's a snowboarding game, which is usually more of a hardcore game, but any idiot can play it. So why don't you go play it?

428
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,240
That's the whole thing is making it more of a casual thing

429
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,120
But they didn't have to do that much. They I mean they just said Oh Pokemon. Okay, this is coming out

430
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,540
they could have showed a trailer for that they could have

431
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,000
Showed Wario Land shake there's a perfect example of a game that can you know?

432
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,040
Be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player

433
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,240
Let me ask let me ask dark soccer because she's been awfully quiet through this

434
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
But I'm just kind of curious of your opinion dark soccer

435
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,840
I did Nintendo really make a misstep with this e3 or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place?

436
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing just because they obviously

437
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,400
address the the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market because this the whole

438
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:24,120
Big thing with business is you want to increase your market share. They know if they release a Zelda or a

439
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,760
Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market. They have their loyal. We're already loyal. They'd be preaching to the choir. I

440
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,960
think

441
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,760
Where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince?

442
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,520
I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this but they're trying to convince

443
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,120
That's this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that

444
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,600
Doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press

445
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,080
You know, I think that they were smart in doing that

446
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,560
I just think there should have been a little bit more mentioned so that like, you know

447
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,760
Throw us a bone or something, but it's seriously their excuse though for doing this is like we don't have enough time

448
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,440
We don't have enough time during our presentation to make these sorts of announcements and to be honest

449
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,480
I mean their presentation was one of the shorter of the presentations out there and

450
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,400
How long is it really gonna take to say we don't have any video footage to show you right now

451
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,480
But our teams are working on new Mario and a new Zelda game

452
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,040
Realize that we are that we already know they're working on some no

453
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:33,320
But they don't have to go and make some sort of claim that you know, oh we're doing this when they know

454
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,360
We want to keep these gamers

455
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,480
We're gonna put out this game that goes without saying there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete

456
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,880
To give us but you know what my wife knows that I love her

457
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,680
But she likes to hear it every now one and again, so this is exactly why we have to do this

458
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,000
They they may we may assume that they're doing this stuff

459
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,800
But you know, what if we don't see it enough? We may not assume it anymore

460
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,200
So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore Loki. Is that what it is? Yes, I think that exactly I think Nintendo

461
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,480
We need to be cuddled. Okay, we have no more, you know Sega systems yet. We keep getting Sonic games

462
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,520
You know Sega knows of their bread and butter is coming from you know, Nintendo isn't you know, it's

463
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:21,040
Have succeeded this long. They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon eating

464
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,760
chained to the jungle gym morons

465
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,160
mmm, no mention name of people but I

466
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:36,200
I think that when it then they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they

467
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,320
Have parameters they have to keep in touch, you know, keep in mind

468
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:46,000
I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out

469
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:52,520
They know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more

470
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:58,480
Curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market

471
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,200
But your core is going to come to you every time but see I want to see if this actually works out for them because

472
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,000
The problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now the mom and pops that bought

473
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,760
You know the Wii system the play Wii Sports now, they're anticipating. Okay. Well, they're gonna buy this Wii Sports Resort thing

474
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,720
I hope that's true because if it's not they're gonna end up with another fucking

475
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,360
Was a big brain Academy game that came out on the Wii and the be honest

476
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,120
No one bought it

477
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,760
So there are they have had a lot of missteps in the casual market because they don't underestimate

478
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,240
I don't think they really know who they're trying to target. All right, let me let me just summarize here

479
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,920
I think all we want is that Reggie all we want is a cuddle

480
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,140
But you know my thing and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know

481
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,200
Yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a frickin bone

482
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,680
Like for instance if we know that in the new Zelda game

483
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,620
Link is gonna ride a gigantic spider then like show us the image of link riding a giant spider and you know

484
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,800
Put out there link and the giant spider friend coming next fall

485
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,700
You know give us something to and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go

486
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,940
Oh my god. Did you see the giant spider?

487
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,180
Exactly. That's all they have to do. Look at Mario Kart. Like I said, this is a perfect example Mario Kart

488
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:22,140
They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a cart racing around. That was it. Nothing from the game

489
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,220
No graphics whatsoever

490
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:29,560
It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that oh my god Mario Kart's coming and it's not like that

491
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,180
We didn't see Mario Kart coming because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system. So

492
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,780
but still that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate another Mario game I

493
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,600
For all I know it could be a crappy and you know, this is gonna come anyways

494
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:50,300
We're like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf and but once again, that's not a hardcore game

495
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:57,600
That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking we to play we sports stop catering the people that play Wii Sports

496
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,020
There are other games out there. They sold their systems didn't they true? Yeah, that's true

497
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,060
We you know what we would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports

498
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,700
I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability just a one little thing. Yeah, this is where it comes down to

499
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,560
Bottom line money. What company is out there?

500
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,220
You know if they were out there too, I guess be nice and sweet and cuddly that'd be you know, a not-for-profit

501
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,380
organization

502
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,540
As it is there they have to make money

503
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,580
What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America? Your mom has more money than you do

504
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:42,380
Um, well, we've done selective targeting for certain products and we feel that the adult demographic would be

505
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,660
Okay, go ahead. Okay. I want to say there's a shower and in chat. It's great. He has a title for my new Zelda game

506
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,900
It's called Legend of Zelda web of lies

507
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,140
All right. Well what I was trying to say before is it you know, they probably see something. Oh well

508
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:03,780
To expand our market we're going to appeal to a different demographic for aiming towards the older people who might have been our core

509
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:09,820
Group at a younger age. We're trying to reclaim the market that is now quote grown out of video games

510
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,780
You should you need to go get a job. Why do you think I was in technical writing for a while?

511
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,340
Very nice. All right, Loki final. Okay, then we get him my final thought

512
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,540
Basically, it's like this. Okay. It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market

513
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,620
The problem is though is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't gonna necessarily

514
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,500
Do a lot of good for you. The problem is you got to get people confident in your platform because

515
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:41,580
Come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4

516
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,380
You're not gonna have a lot of people, you know wanting to buy your next system because

517
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,780
They bought the Wii and that's all they play is Wii Sports. So why do they need to buy your next system?

518
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,620
That's the problem. And if you cater these people that are just casual gamers

519
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,440
They're not gonna come back for more. In fact when you have people buying that your next Nintendo system

520
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,380
They may not buy your next Nintendo system

521
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,700
They may just go somewhere else and that's where you're gonna end up hurting. It's down later on

522
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,020
I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the Justin TVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read

523
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,660
But I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about it in there

524
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:21,460
Some folks are saying a Pokemon MMO is what's needed

525
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,580
Could be interesting. I mean Pokemon sure is one of those

526
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:32,340
Universal franchises that sells like, you know, it's free money, but MMO on a Wii would be very interesting

527
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,380
That would be very easy to do actually if you think about it. I think so too. Because I mean, alright for example

528
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,940
I can't believe it hasn't already happened

529
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,780
Well for an example, um, actually a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture

530
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,140
your

531
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,100
Different creatures as your pets and then once they become loyal they help you fight

532
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,220
I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually cat

533
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,780
You know if they can do it on a regular video game

534
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,620
Why can't they have it in multiplayer format and then you have like for example, like you have your arena system

535
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:09,180
You can actually have your gyms be set up that way, you know, and you've got whoever you know

536
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,980
It was like has the best group or whatever. So you have a continuously

537
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,340
A rotating list and like maybe your gym leaders like one of the GM's or something. All right. Anyhow. Anyhow, let's move on

538
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,860
It's a very very I know you have more Nintendo news, but hey stuff about Reggie, okay

539
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,140
Reggie is like, okay

540
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:35,100
we know pretty much said from an America centric perspective to quote that the

541
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:43,100
Weezer storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like we wear in virtual console and he told

542
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:49,780
MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution. So he says that Nintendo is working on something

543
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,420
They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something but I

544
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,900
Actually

545
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,900
Think that they're gonna and while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB based at knowing Nintendo

546
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:11,660
They're going to try to do something proprietary something that can't be mimicked something that no one's gonna be able in theory

547
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,940
No one's going to be able to break and just you know hack their own like, you know

548
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:22,860
We used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives. Remember? Yeah, they're going to try to do something

549
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:28,020
That's that they would have control over. It's just frustrating though because they put USB slots

550
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,500
They put SD card slots in that we why does it have to be freaking proprietary?

551
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,300
You know like it by doing that it kind of showed the promise of Oh mass storage

552
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,580
Hey good idea, and it's not being used. I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you be something really simple

553
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,340
It could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done

554
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:54,420
It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing. Just open up USB to use storage devices

555
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,100
Your problem solved right there. It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer

556
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,540
I mean, it's no different than it is gonna make from that. I'm sorry. Where's the money for them to make from that?

557
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:08,060
Oh, you don't have to make money off everything show Nintendo USB drives

558
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:15,780
That they'll release in stores along with that for ten dollars more than the generic brands will cause I still think they're gonna have some

559
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,740
Way to system lock and even if they do it via USB

560
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,060
they're gonna have some sort of code that you have to read off of the

561
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:29,080
The storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing

562
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,700
To hack the system. I think I seriously think what it is. So you that's why it's

563
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,500
Investment

564
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,140
From a business perspective

565
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:43,060
They're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their power

566
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:48,980
Let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system

567
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,380
Well, they were aiming for a certain price for their system. I mean, but they're paying for it now

568
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,020
Now the gamers are like now it's kind of like they put the cart before the whole horse with this whole we wear thing

569
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,780
Oh great. They're filling up that drive. I can't wait for the special dog and no dongle the attachment

570
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,700
It's gonna attach to as well that's gonna give it high-def graphics

571
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:12,380
Oh, maybe we'll get someone that you know, gives us some good online or maybe I don't know one that gives us some better games

572
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,300
Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades

573
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,900
As I mean think about it. I bet you any this is this is my prediction

574
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,260
Okay

575
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:29,140
We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii it's either going to run

576
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,180
Off of USB or have some sort of it

577
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:38,020
Either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage

578
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:45,220
Whatever with the Wii and then as it progresses we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something, you know

579
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,820
Maybe the you know new upgrade they drop the price the old we bring out the new we at the rigor price of storage becomes

580
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:57,180
You know even more cheap as the you know, time goes by and we're going to get a new Nintendo

581
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,660
Yeah, that's why I understand they can't do that now because the price of flash storage has gone down so much

582
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:07,060
They could just say okay going forward now all the ways that we put out are gonna have four gigs of storage instead

583
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Yeah, I'll piss off a lot of people but you know what tough

584
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,020
All right, I'm was at least

585
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,820
There the Reggie admits the problem is out there

586
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:23,140
Even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that the whole American centric perspective

587
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,020
At least they they are finally admitting there's a problem

588
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,580
Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from

589
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,220
Has been and this is at least as far as I've seen to has been mostly the American market

590
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,260
So I think he's saying well at least Nintendo of America loves you

591
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,780
It's our cuddle Rob interesting I guess maybe that was our cuddle, I don't know we'll see

592
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,220
Oh

593
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,420
Smack him in the fucking face. Seriously. Oh, yeah, we acknowledge there's a problem now

594
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that. He needs a little love

595
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:00,940
Would he be so angry if somebody would oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people. Oh, that would be awesome

596
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,700
I think that Loki needs something that starts with the D and ends with the E and there's two words. It's called duct tape

597
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:15,040
Loki on my own. Yeah, my only wish is that you know, you take your little media badge at this event

598
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,580
This is Orange Lounge radio and you put a sticker over it. This is Bobby Black Wolf show before you go

599
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,500
people

600
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
I'll take it a step further. I'll put my name is

601
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:32,340
Someone follow follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking, but we'll be like, okay interviews over next ding-ding-ding-ding-ding

602
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,940
So speaking of newest Rob you would you would love it if I just like put on a mask and like dress up like Captain

603
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Anger or something

604
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,020
You could be mr. Furious mr. Furious. All right, let's move on

605
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,180
Apparently because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing

606
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:57,020
That certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market

607
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:04,540
These would include any a Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks. So any of your classic controllers

608
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:10,420
your GameCube controllers those are going to be taken from the market and

609
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:20,220
Of course the Wii remote and nunchuck are okay because it was only have one analog stick and this is all because of that

610
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,540
wonderful

611
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:30,860
21 million dollar patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and escape

612
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:36,540
That has sued them and you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money

613
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,700
or licensing rights

614
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:47,460
Do you think it's actually gonna happen I don't know it it's well, I mean they have to pay them because it

615
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
You know, the verdict has been placed

616
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,520
The thing is though there's well second level appeals room court appeal

617
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,120
Well escape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make

618
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,060
Controllers, I guess I don't honestly think that they're gonna try to make controllers

619
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,120
I think that there's money would have kind of done it by now

620
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,660
Yeah, Lord. Katsu. Hito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat dot orange hundred calm probably most likely

621
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,660
It's usually the way these things go

622
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,020
Anyways

623
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:26,520
Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii bonus content feature very soon over in Japan

624
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:34,140
It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16 digit code into this bonus thing and you get a new

625
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,920
Present so to speak the Wii speaker channel is the first thing that's supposed to be used using this

626
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,520
It's coming with that, you know that game on the Nintendo DS

627
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,580
I think we talked about it a few weeks ago that it's kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio

628
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,580
translation of channels or whatever

629
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:58,140
Interesting, but there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for we points

630
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:06,740
free download games virtual console sell it and sell virtual console games in stores kind of like what Xbox Live does with their

631
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:12,580
Own redemption system like you can buy Uno or Texas hold them like in a store on a card and give it as a gift

632
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,460
So I don't think that's what this is for. I

633
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,060
Think if it even comes out here

634
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,660
Yes, and I think this the only thing this is it's to deter piracy

635
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,860
Because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately

636
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,420
Ironically enough though all those bonus things that they're talking about like the Wii speaker channel leaked to the internet anyways

637
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,420
So it's not gonna matter

638
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,380
Well, there is a

639
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,780
Something that I think is gonna be very very very

640
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,940
Cool to come out at least in Japan, and I don't think we're gonna get it here

641
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:56,500
But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the purika the print club stuff, but it's actually not quite

642
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:04,340
It's called the digi cam print channel. That's going to be on the Wii. It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm where

643
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:11,140
You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and

644
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:19,100
You can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book. That's

645
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,020
1575 yen

646
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,180
Or you can get a Mario one. That's

647
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,260
2480

648
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:32,560
And you can actually even have them print it out to well you can

649
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,120
Have your meshi printed out which is a Japanese business card you hit it's like your name card, basically

650
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:44,040
You know the the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it

651
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,640
Mm-hmm, but you can have your meshi with your Wii on it and you've got your Wii be your me on it for

652
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,680
500 yen for 30 cards, so it's actually pretty cool

653
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,040
I wish we could get something like this would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game

654
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,040
I have on those cards, too. I

655
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,400
Don't see why not I mean I would think so that actually would be a very smart idea

656
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,880
To have you know your your friend could be both you and I need to be working at Nintendo

657
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,400
But I'll tell you what and the good idea department

658
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,280
And I'm gonna link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down

659
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,280
but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube and

660
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,640
I'm looking at it. It's actually pretty pretty cool. This is actually a

661
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,160
Fujifilm's demo showing how it works

662
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,760
And it's it's really really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes

663
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,960
And have messages on them

664
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,720
It's actually very cool and also send them to to people it seems pretty cool

665
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,640
What I'm seeing on this do you think it's something that would work here, or is this is this better for Japan's culture?

666
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,720
I think it is it's more

667
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:54,740
Surrounded around I would say how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right

668
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,320
Why not I mean if the channel already exists?

669
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:04,520
It's just translation and and on Fujifilm's end you know or whatever company they partnered with in America

670
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
Just a matter of you know

671
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,960
I was gonna say Fujifilm's here

672
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,460
So why not fish as long as they have a presence of getting the oh is that are they behind snapfish?

673
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:20,660
I don't know. Oh, I'm mentioning snapfish every you know every photo company has had to evolve to maintain

674
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:27,280
Competition with the digital photography, so I'm sure they have something set up the way that I see this is that if

675
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:36,460
If like say you know rock bands are going through rock band to you know have their musical presence

676
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:44,660
Fortified in the industry when you know everything is digital download and all that then why can't you know the photo companies make use of?

677
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,660
This I think it's a good idea

678
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:53,980
And on top of that is it's convenient instead of having to take you know a CD in to have it printed

679
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,940
Or do it yourself. You just be no pay 15 bucks and have them send you a photo album with everything in it

680
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:05,100
Game guru in chat says damn sooner or later. They will fill the Wii with just channels kind of

681
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,980
Kind of a good point because you know the Wii only has four screens worth of channels

682
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,360
I want the channel channel the channel channel the change channel channel

683
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,760
Now as unfortunately as they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to

684
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,680
Store all those channels

685
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah

686
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,480
Alpha Kananagrams in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP big fan of the whole

687
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,880
Fuji film channel idea all right. We will see

688
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,100
Well, this isn't for the Wii, but it uses the Wii remotes

689
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,840
there is a brand new homebrew game made called dark room sex game and

690
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:46,880
what this basically is is two people will take the Wii remotes, and they will kind of make a

691
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,760
kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the

692
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,880
Pornographic sounds there's no images. It's just all audio

693
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,880
That you hear on the screen, and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish

694
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,500
this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8 I

695
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,060
I

696
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,500
Wish I had brought my bluetooth

697
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,100
Adapter next week though we can maybe do this on the show

698
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,220
You know for that

699
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,420
For that extra. It's all audio array. It'll be awesome

700
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,340
All right, yeah gold banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat weirdest homebrew ever

701
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:30,760
But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there. I believe they have a

702
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,100
It's a

703
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,100
website itu.dk

704
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,300
slash stud slash darkroom is

705
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:50,020
Right and game grew in chat says the kind of obvious comment here. Why not you know have sex

706
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:57,380
Because this is this is safer. You can't can't contract babies or a okay. I see

707
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:02,600
AIDS and baby free I get it, so there's there's I guess the

708
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:09,360
Positive unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had in which case you could probably you yeah

709
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
You might be able to get genital herpes

710
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,860
Herpes maybe using the proper now make it a gear attachments

711
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,980
All right, well, please let's change the topic real quick here. I have them and talk about, Castlevania

712
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,520
Because Castlevania is pretty awesome

713
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:32,840
Castlevania why Castlevania has to follow a story about a sex game is because Castlevania is sex I mean Castlevania is that good and I

714
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,640
Had no idea this was coming, but apparently there's a Castlevania arcade game

715
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,680
Akumajo Dracula the arcade and there's been some location tests going on over in Japan and

716
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,240
Some folks are already kind of leaking their opinions to the internet

717
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,720
Apparently you can actually enter the machine from one side or the other. There's a pretty spacious inside and

718
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,320
There was LED lit candles on the inside of the machine which I think is kind of cool

719
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:03,320
You hold a controller that's shaped like the handle of a whip and the top of the whip also has LEDs in it

720
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,560
First player has blue one second player gets dark pink ones

721
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:13,600
And then you have a little yellow trigger on the whip where your index finger goes and that is for sub weapons like knives

722
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,760
Crosses potions all of that stuff, and then there's another button where your thumb is

723
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,200
so apparently

724
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,760
And that thumb button is used for items later in the game

725
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,760
You stand in a designated spot you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game

726
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,120
I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things and then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out

727
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,640
And they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them

728
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:43,960
So that's kind of neat and then of course the weapons like knives. They do take hearts. Just like the game

729
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,140
That's like 25 heart, so it sounds like a shooting game with like a Castlevania twist on it

730
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:50,280
So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii

731
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,480
Possibly there's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii rumors I

732
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,280
Think that there's more than one way to do it too. It doesn't necessarily have to be we only

733
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,880
This sounds neat in theory though. It does and it sounds pretty cool speaking of Silent Hill

734
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,680
I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now. I know Comcast is nationwide

735
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,400
I don't know if they're on demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the on demand in HD

736
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:21,840
For free on Comcast on demand so I actually watched it this weekend with William and and he well

737
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,400
He'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all

738
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,760
He needed me to explain it to him so we watched it, and I did but I'll tell you what Silent Hill in HD

739
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,280
very very hot

740
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,480
Sweet is very good-looking movie

741
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,400
And I I still like Silent Hill as a movie

742
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,320
And I hope that I hope the rumors of the sequel are true that they are doing it. I hope so, too

743
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:47,760
Okay, well how about some release dates Rob? How about it? Well for the 30th in the UK?

744
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,000
we have double D dodgeball on Xbox 360 and

745
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,480
Geometry Wars retro evolved to on Xbox 360

746
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,920
On the first though is a whole crap ton of stuff brothers in arms hell's highway

747
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:08,820
Ferrari challenge and that's on we by the way a flat-out ultimate carnage on PC hellboy the science of evil for ps3

748
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:15,620

766
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,780
Yeah, and if you don't want to play a fighting game spectral force 3 looks like a pretty good role-playing game

767
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:40,860
So there you go a very similar story over in Japan doing the Japanese release date

768
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:46,280
So we also have Soulcalibur 4 being a big presence in the Xbox 360 this week in Japan being released on the 31st of July

769
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:51,880
Also a special fighting stick is coming out from Hori to kind of commemorate Soulcalibur 4

770
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:58,400
Beijing Olympics 2008 also coming out on the Xbox 360 this week in Japan going over to the PlayStation 3

771
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:05,040
they're also getting Soulcalibur 4 of course on the 31st, and they are also getting the special fighting stick as well and

772
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,360
If you want Beijing Olympics 2008 on PlayStation 3 guess what here you go

773
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:14,720
It's coming out in Japan this week now going over the Nintendo Wii not a lot of games

774
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,200
I've heard of before but they do have a Dokapon Kingdom for Wii is coming out on on

775

the 31st as well as Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo is coming out as well and

Zero Gesu no Kamen comes out as well this week

777
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,240
And that game looks to be like a little bit of a survivor horror type game. So this game actually looks kind of cool

778
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,640
Kind of looking at some of the CG from the game. It's like crazy Fatal Frame 4. Is that what this is?

779
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,000
Yeah, ah, it's their version of Fatal Frame 4

780
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,200
very

781
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,760
Cool. I was gonna say that Dokapon Kingdom. That's that party game from Atlas the one that's

782
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,600
Promising that you'll ruin your friendship with your friends if you play it

783
00:58:54,440 --> 00:59:00,360
Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It was on Mario Party type game. Yeah. What about this other one since we looked at the other two

784
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,960
Wii de Tokotan Kanji noo looks like I

785
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,360
Think it's like a it looks like one of those 200 in game 250 games in a game type thing

786
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,960
It looks a little weird. All right, probably not so many people going over that

787
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:17,880
Other systems, let's go to the handheld systems to see what's coming out in Japan. I'm sorry first PlayStation 2

00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,720
The top screen is her face and the bottom screen is her boobies on the DS there

796
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,640

01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:25,280
Looking at those releases a little bit going on over there as well fantasy star portable being the most notable of the releases in Japan

801
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,880
This week Panic Palette portable and Giga Ojou Somo Denotsu Collection

802

Oh Joe Soma. Yeah, it's the PC Engine best collection. It's a PC Engine best collection

803
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,360
It's three PC Engine games

804
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,760
I'm not sure what games they are. That looks familiar. I just don't know what that is. They're

805
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,940
I'm a chick fighting. Yeah, it looks very familiar something

806
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:54,880
I don't know if it's come out or coming out though that I want from overseas. Hmm. What's that? That's um, the uh, a

807
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:00,140
Fantasy zone collection. I think we've covered it before they're shooters. Just you know, yeah

808
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,120
That's really familiar. I probably have a couple of them

809
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,840
All right. Well, there you have it your Japanese release dates busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan

810
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,080
well, um

811
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,840
speaking of other busy events is that um, there has been a little um, I

812
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,560
guess

813
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:24,360
Controversy regarding a lack of halo information from what I understand the e3

814
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:34,540
But they actually were saying that halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote

815
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,440
Big enough at this point that it can stand on its own

816
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:43,120
so there are a few hints going around and they've mentioned comic-con and

817
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,280
other

818
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,360
Conventions that there might be a halo con. In fact, um

819
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:52,600
Let me go see if I can't get this

820
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,360
name

821
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,460
Just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy

822
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
well, um

823
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,560
But it was I guess one of the the higher-ups saying that you can do a halo con

824
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:15,280
Nothing on the scale of comic-con, but you could bring a few hundred people to see a halo thing

825
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:21,000
If there were a Microsoft and bungee endorse like halo tournament uber thing. I bet I bet people would come

826
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,280
It depends where they have it Rob. I'd go

827
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,960
It won't wait. It would depend on where they have it. I'd go

828
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,200
I mean, I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it

829
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,040
But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive maybe even la heck. Yeah, who knows?

830
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:41,540
Well, halo con possibly coming soon. I see kidnapped the press to bring him to that. You know

831
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,120
Scared the crap out of them. Let's be fun cosplay Master Chief

832
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:52,520
You think there'd be Master Chief cosplay halo con I would hope and Cortana and all your favorite and people dress up like Star Wars

833
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:58,400
Characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is. I don't know why

834
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,280
In fact someday when we have a well our con, you know some way it was some day way in the way in the future

835
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,120
We encourage people to come as Star Wars cosplayers

836
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,920
Yeah, because um, well Microsoft has actually made a games for Windows lives free for all

837
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,000
Maybe because the service didn't really I don't know

838
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,440
Fulfill what it's promised to be really take off. Yeah, it kind of

839
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:32,400
Didn't necessarily meet a kind of butter. But anyways, um, so yes, if you did pay for it already they are refunding your money and

840
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:40,520
it is effective immediately that games such as like Halo 2 and shadowrun and all future releases are free to play and

841
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,880
Actually, I heard another interesting rumor 3 is awesome, I think you're thinking the same thing I am what did you hear

842
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,880
I heard the rumor that

843
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,640
the games that are cross-platform enabled like shadowrun and

844
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,640
I want to say there was another one lost planet

845
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:09,380
Those if you have an Xbox 360 version of you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now and then

846
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:10,800
away

847
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,800
to more

848
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:17,960
Things possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox. That could be very interesting

849
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,440
We'll see is it because it's probably just competition from things like steam and other products that exist, you know out there all these kind of

850
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:25,560
competing

851
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:31,400
Portals for games on PC so to speak. It's lost planet colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform

852
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,160
Yeah, according to act deft and chat

853
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,680
Well, I like free so that's pretty cool. Except, you know, what did you hear play Halo on the computer the same thing?

854
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:45,400
Okay, that the silver accounts on Xbox live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit

855
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,280
One game I'm excited about when it comes to Xbox live in the future

856
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,040
Which by the way, it's not just coming to Xbox live supposed to be on PlayStation Network and Nintendo

857
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,840
We wear Mega Man 9 who is not excited about Mega Man 9 what you?

858
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,480
Get off my show. No, I'm just kidding

859
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,880
This this Mega Man 9 looks great

860
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:07,880
And I think it's cute that they're kind of going the extra mile with the retro goodness of this and an e3 some Mega Man 9

861
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:13,880
Box art t-shirts were spotted and it is the same classic cheesy box art

862
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,360
with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art, you know

863
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,520
It's like somebody happily great someone in Capcom got the joke. Yeah in other words

864
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:28,600
Well, they are actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog

865
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,640
Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art

866
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:39,880
Including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon

867
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,800
Awesome. Did you see the other one that they put out? Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other

868
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,400
Meatbun.com I think it was what it was. No, it was the

869
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,360
1942

870
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:56,040
Pinup girl thing with cami that shirt. Oh, I saw that not as funny. I ordered one

871
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,800
Did you you would I need new teeth. That was the other game. I played on Xbox live this week

872
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:04,920
I didn't even talk about 1942 now. That's how you remake a retro game for Xbox live

873
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,880
That's all I have to say that was I only played on Xbox live

874
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,440
That's all I have to say that was I only played the demo

875
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,520
But I was I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port

876
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,560
I have in a long time other than maybe pac-man championship edition

877
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:23,720
so just check that out if you were if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases because

878
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,360
1942 was pretty awesome. I gotta say

879
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,560
I like uh, the 19. What was the 1942 kai? That was a good one

880
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:36,600
But I want to see the the 1940 xx ones remade. Wouldn't that be cool? That would be really sweet

881
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:38,600
but um

882
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:46,620
Going back to the whole retro side of thing is that um, there's a hint that um, Igarashi is planning on doing a new castlevania

883
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,320
in 2d

884
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,480
For we on we wear that's going to be pretty cool. Um

885
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,640
It's uh supposed to be um

886
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,960
Trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the castlevania series

887
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,120
so, um

888
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:10,600
He says that he's gonna um pay attention to how a mega man 9

889
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,720
Uh is with the market and base his decision on that. So that's that's smart

890
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:21,320
I like this trend mega man 9 seems to be starting. Yeah, this could be very good

891
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,400
I think it's like, you know, it would also be very bad

892
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,760
We love our 2d but no one wants to really admit it in the 3d market until someone just says ah screw it

893
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:33,000
We're doing it anyway, and they're like, hey, they're making money on this

894
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,640
I don't think safe for very little money into it. You know, let's do it

895
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,280
I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it. I just don't understand why they don't

896
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,840
Why more people haven't been doing 2d games they sell just as well

897
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,400
People people are sucked in by 3d

898
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:55,000
I think someone figured out where to touch that retro nerve and that was capcom with the the mega man and now they got people

899
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Excited now the other companies are going huh?

900
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:04,440
Could could we make money too could could retro goodness be a money-making machine now the problem it hopefully just the pool doesn't get diluted

901
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,680
Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything

902
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:15,560
I don't know. I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means actually have to work on it

903
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,720
you know versus

904
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,480
I don't know just like hoarding something from like the playstation 2 or the gamecube

905
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,720
true

906
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,240
true

907
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,240
this is something that's pretty exciting and

908
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,800
I don't know why i'm excited about it since I you know up until a couple weeks ago

909
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,800
Didn't know what the hell the watchman was

910
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,840
Um, I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it

911
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:44,200
Although I am interested in reading it now. But anyways, um at comic con they announced that they're going to be making

912
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:49,100
Um watchman episodic games on the pc ps3 and the 360

913
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:54,680
And these are going to coincide with the theatrical and dvd release of the films

914
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:59,160
So i'm assuming running up through march and you know, whenever the hell the film comes out

915
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:05,880
And they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storyline. So that's kind of cool

916
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:12,520
and they showed off some footage of it and the first uh, the kind of level that they showed off was with night owl and

917
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,640
uh row shot and it was kind of um

918
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:18,600
Pretty cool like beat him up type game

919
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:24,700
Game, they said it's also being um crafted by the person that's uh, or I should say the team behind faith in a 45

920
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,560
uh, which I want to say was a

921
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,480
game cop

922
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,280
Game cock game that was supposed to be coming out. No, actually, I think that that didn't have a publisher yet

923
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,080
but uh faith in 45 looked pretty awesome, so

924
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,240
um

925
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,920
Looks good. Can't wait to see it

926
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,240
Uh tiger high in our chat room wanted to point out loki

927
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,720
Warner brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of the watchman on itunes

928
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,880
The first chapter is free cool

929
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,880
So if you're into the watchman, this is a very happy period of time for you

930
01:09:54,600 --> 01:10:00,520
Uh, also a very happy period of time for geometry wars fans because geometry wars 2 is coming and guess what?

931
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:06,840
Unlike most xbox live arcade news. We usually have it's coming earlier than anticipated. That's great news

932
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,720
Uh, it's coming this week. July 30th is the big day for geometry wars 2 the bad news

933
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,640
It's not another five dollar game

934
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,880
It's a ten dollar game, but supposedly, uh, this game has a lot of new features

935
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,840
And you can even see from the early screenshots kind of like a four player mode in this game, which looks to be pretty awesome

936
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:24,840
um, so

937
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:31,720
I will definitely be checking this out and downloading it and apparently the trial version of geometry wars 2 is like the full

938
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,940
deadline game mode including

939
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:39,720
Multiplayer support but only locally but that's still pretty cool that the demo seems to be pretty generous for this game

940
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:42,680
so well, then the multiplayers are online anyways, because

941
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:47,320
You know with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online because the lag is true. That's true

942
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,240
Uh, and bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on xbox live for the new geometry wars

943
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,720
Yes, there is I downloaded it and checked it out. Looks looks pretty neat

944
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,720
Uh, I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat

945
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,200
Uh, the graphics have this kind of adjusted

946
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,160
Uh, I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what but I have a feeling this might be the final product this adjusted

947
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:09,560
Like soft tone to them that makes it look like an old vetrex game or something

948
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,240
It looks like they put vaseline on the camera lens

949
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,760
But it it sounds better than loki's describing it

950
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:22,040
It makes it gives a real soft look to it that gives an old 80s game flare. So it's kind of cool. I like that

951
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:27,560
All right, it'd be awesome to have geometry wars on vetrex like someone to do a homebrew game

952
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,720
You never know people are pretty crazy

953
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,520
All right, uh, this is now the part of the show where we're gonna take a quick break

954
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,840
Um, but not until we get to the classic game of the week because we always before the break like to talk

955
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:44,600
A little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness, which how appropriate following a story about geometry wars 2

956
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,600
Which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming

957
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:53,320
Dark soccer is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out and this week's title

958
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,720
If I'm not saying it's pretty obscure at least it was one

959
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,920
I had never heard of until I saw it on because I get I get to know before the rest of you

960
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,600
I saw it on the show roll this week

961
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:09,800
So i'm very curious to hear more about this game tonight in dark soccer's classic game of the week

962
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:17,720
The classic game of the week is a game that was on the neo geo systems, um put out by um

963
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,200
Sauris is the developer. Um, it's called shock troopers

964
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,920
Shock troopers is really freaking awesome

965
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:32,200
Um, basically, it's imagine how like a plane shooter game would be except you're running on the ground and that's what you've got

966
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,760
Um

967
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:41,880
You um, basically you can uh fire your guns in eight directions. You can strafe you can um

968
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:49,080
Uh, if you attack uh point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and the extra life things like that

969
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:52,040
You can you actually have a dodge button too

970
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:57,880
There's a team battle mode. Um, you can uh, pick different, uh soldiers in the game and everything

971
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,680
Um

972
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,680
and actually, um

973
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:08,680
One of the uh, the cool things about this is that um, it was actually intense. It was uh,

974
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,880
From what I understand that it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to metal slug

975
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,520
So that's actually pretty cool even though it, you know completely is in a different, uh

976
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:26,040
Direction, but you've got uh different characters too. You have jackal who has a grenade for special weapon milky who uses napalm

977
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,240
There's a loki in this who uses explosive shells

978
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,040
Southern cross who uses a boomerang marie b who has a rocket launcher

979
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:40,760
Rio has exploding arrows maru has grass gas grenades and big mama has a grenade launcher

980
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,600
I want to play this game as big mama. That sounds awesome

981
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:49,400
But as you go through the game, um, you can actually pick a different path the jungle mountain or valley

982
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,200
um, and you can switch to a different route or

983
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:58,200
Continue on the same so it's basically sort of a running gun sort of sort of game cool

984
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,720
The guy has a flamethrower right there looks like a kari warrior watching it. Yeah, it looks like a car

985
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,800
Yeah, it is a lot like a warrior a lot more souped up

986
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,080
Um, and there's also one called shock trooper second squad

987
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,400
Um, that's supposed to be stand alone. Um, no connection

988
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:17,560
Um, and uh, you can only choose the four characters, um, and it has no team mode

989
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:24,040
It is also a little bit more cartoony and um, the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them

990
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:29,160
Um, because it's actually it's a lot completely too deep. The 3d graphics are pre-rendered. So

991
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:33,400
It's actually a release on playstation 2 and psp

992
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,440
So that's pretty cool. It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade

993
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:43,960
It was actually we got it in north america through the smk arcade classics volume one and now you can get it on the wii 2

994
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,520
That just came out

995
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,960
Really yeah smk arcade. Oh, oh the class. Oh, I thought you meant on virtual console. I'm like really I don't remember

996
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,880
Okay, I like the music in it too. It's very, you know, let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear

997
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:04,520
It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it

998
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:13,160
Cool, all right. Yeah, pretty cool. So there it is your classic game of the week shock troopers for the neo geo

999
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,640
Pretty awesome. I think it's just the neo geo arcade systems. Well, you know

1000
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,440
close enough

1001
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,840
Yeah, it never took that back. It did come out on the um, avs

1002
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,040
I was gonna say couldn't you get just about any arcade came out on the avs?

1003
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,160
Is it a hard to find one? I don't think so. Okay. I just had forgotten about it. That's all right

1004
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,360
All right. So there you have it shock troopers your classic game of the week and we are going to take a quick break

1005
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,880
But we will be back in just a minute with more of orange lounge radio again

1006
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,320

Hi, this is your buddy rob roberts here recently

1011
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,760
I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on xbox live

1012
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:11,800
You always can't suck my fucking dick. I just got a dick in your ass. Do I have dick in your butt?

1013
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:15,480
Can where's barbie? Yeah, where's barbie? Is that urkel urkel's your barbie, huh?

1014
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:20,200
She in malibu or no, please stop spewing hate speech on xbox live

1015
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:25,000
It doesn't make you look cool. It won't get you any friends and at the end of the day

1016
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:28,060
You still have an incredibly small penis

1017
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,860

For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat orange lounge radio

calm

1024
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:11,560
All right, we're halfway there. We got plenty more news to cover tonight. Uh, let's get right into it

1025
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,560
Loki start us off

1026
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,440
If you can put you on your ds for five minutes come back to the show you are

1027
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:26,200
I'm, sorry. Am I interrupting something loki? I was just playing cord 10 ds. Anyways, um, there are rumors via linked

1028
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
Or I should say a leaked

1029
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,560
pictures of a I guess a psp case

1030
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,360
Um saying that the psp 3000 has already been or is in works right now

1031
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:42,680
In fact, this supposedly picture is of one of the designs that they I don't know didn't go with

1032
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:47,480
and um some of the features though on this design which may you know

1033
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,240
Reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final psp 3000 design

1034
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:57,100
Includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a playstation

1035
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:59,640
button much like on the um

1036
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:05,080
Ps3 six axis or dualshock 3 controllers, so i'm not too surprised by that

1037
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,080
I'm, not too surprised by that. Um

1038
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,880
That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet

1039
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,520
Because there may be a whole nother

1040
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,840
psp coming out

1041
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,020
And i'm sure this one will be completely unhackable

1042
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,800
Oh, yeah, because sony prevented that now you they they said we're putting stuff to this right now. That's right

1043
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:30,200
It's only taking us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it. Absolutely no more

1044
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,520
All right. Well, what do you think?

1045
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,880
I mean is it time for the psp to get a remodel or is it too soon or will it drive sales? What?

1046
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,640
um

1047
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,480
I don't think it's going to drive sales

1048
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:45,480
I mean it might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone it may allow them to do

1049
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,680
More things with it depending on what features they add to it

1050
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,440
You know with a built-in microphone you can play crappy karaoke games

1051
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:57,160
You can do the stupid stuff that they do with the ds where you can blow into the microphone to do things

1052
01:18:58,360 --> 01:18:59,960
I don't know

1053
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,760
Um might be kind of cool to do really crappy skype

1054
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:08,120
Without using a headset with it. I guess that's true voice over ip possibly, you know

1055
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:14,920
You could do some side talking so sony fans next time. Uh, someone tries to tell you the psp blows you can say yes it does

1056
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,800
right

1057
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:23,160
Or you blow on the psp you blow the psp, you can go blow the psp. Um

1058
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:31,000
Um, hey one of the uh, interesting games that was being shown at e3 this year by sony was a little game called fat princess

1059
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:39,640
Um, very unique standout title. That's for sure. And apparently the game is playable with 32 people online. Uh, and uh, what's

1060
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:44,600
It just kind of looks interesting. It has a very unique kind of art style to it kind of looks like a cartoon thing

1061
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,760
but apparently

1062
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:52,140
The feminist gamers are not happy is his actual gaming blog feminist gamers.com

1063
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:57,100
Gamers.com is one gaming blog and shakes shakesville is another one

1064
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:05,500
Shakespeare's sister.blogspot.com which by the way great 90s band with shakespeare's sister, uh, these uh blogs are not happy. Uh, they are voicing. Uh,

1065
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:11,100
Great displeasure to sony, uh in shakespeare. They said quote congrats on your awesome new game sony

1066
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:16,620
I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating

1067
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,460
heteronormative assholes and then uh feminist gamer, uh,

1068
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:27,100
Quoted quote instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with why not go out and find gold

1069
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:32,140
To stuff into a treasure chest the more gold in the chest the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry

1070
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:36,940
Uh, so obviously some women groups are getting very upset now titan studios

1071
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,640
The art director there has actually came out and commented on the whole situation

1072
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,100
after this, uh, he actually um

1073
01:20:43,820 --> 01:20:49,660
Said does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look characters and everything is a girl?

1074
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:52,540
So how about they all just shut up and get over it?

1075
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:58,300
Learn to be offended people. It's not you know, if people got their you know

1076
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,180
Less of a stick up their ass about certain things. I think the world would be a whole lot nicer. Don't you?

1077
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:09,340
And notice that the game is called fat princess. It's not saying like all women are fat

1078
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:14,060
I mean if they put out a game called that I can see where people might get a little bit offended

1079
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:17,820
But it's just a princess who happens to be fat

1080
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,380
But let let us remember the mika song big girl. You are beautiful

1081
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:27,980
What's what's wrong with you know this this is just it's innocent

1082
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:31,340
I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this. You know what I mean?

1083
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,860
So

1084
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:39,660
Yeah, there you have it. I'm curious chat. Is it is it offensive or no? Let's see, uh,

1085
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:47,260
Game guru says they complain about unrealistic looks for women with laura croft. I guess trying to say, you know, laura

1086
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,900
you know, it should be called or the game should be called fat princess gets no love and

1087
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:57,820
Because she's fat. Let's see. That's wrong. That's right. That's offensive. Uh, janaya says fat kirby

1088
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:01,500
I don't see kirby's pretty fat. How how about this?

1089
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:05,260
How about lose any sort of social, you know?

1090
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,620
The the only reason that I think that there's such a bad

1091
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:13,280
Social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it

1092
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,280
It's like why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop

1093
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,200
Being so fucking offended if you don't have a problem with weight then don't worry about it

1094
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,040
It's not your problem

1095
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,040
What if they don't get offended for people? Why don't they just call the game? I like cake

1096
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,680
perfect

1097
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:39,760
Okay, because seriously if cake offends somebody then there's just no pleasing you right

1098
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,800
I like cake. I like cake a lot. I mean seriously look at me

1099
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,680
All right. Can we move on please?

1100
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,760
Loki offends me

1101
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:57,200
Well, guess what? What's that? Something that might not offend people. Although people always find a reason to get offended is um

1102
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,000
There's gonna be more dragon force in guitar hero 3

1103
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,120
I I the only thing that's going to be offended is my high score

1104
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,600
With that because if the dragon force songs are as hard as the one in the game i'm going to be screwed

1105
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:14,560
well, the songs that some of the songs included are heroes of our time and operation ground and pound and

1106
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,360
a revolution death squad

1107
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:20,000
Nice, they're going to be 500. Um

1108
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,880
Microsoft points for those three

1109
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,880
Sounds like a good time. Hell. Yeah

1110
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,600
I like dragon force good stuff

1111
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,200
I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck

1112
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,760
Well one thing not coming to the playstation network anytime soon is wipeout hd

1113
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:43,860
Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests. The game is so hardcore. It makes people have seizures

1114
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:48,240
So, uh now that's offensive

1115
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,040
yeah, apparently, um

1116
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,960
I guess it's

1117
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:01,040
I guess it's according to uh computers and video games wipeouts h or wipeout hd's delay is because um

1118
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,800
A little bit more technical features. It's uh extra features

1119
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,880
and

1120
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,360
Apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy tests

1121
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,120
Can you imagine what would happen if sony had neglected to do that like how much poop they'd be in?

1122
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:23,120
In the general populace if they had like just forgot to make that kind of testing and all these kids everywhere

1123
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,920
Were having seizures because of a video game. Oh my god

1124
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,920
I guess it's a good thing. They go through all these strict tests before video games released, huh?

1125
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,240
Yeah in a way

1126
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,320
It's a good thing. They have all those seizure warnings on their manuals and stuff. That's true, too

1127
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,800
Um, anyhow the dark knight have you seen the dark knight movie?

1128
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:45,040
Kind of yeah kind of neat. No, I'm not going to you're not excited. I don't want to see it

1129
01:24:45,040 --> 01:24:48,240
Why not? It wasn't bad. It was long. I've decided. I don't want to see it

1130
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,880
All right. Well your choice it is

1131
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,480
Movies are expensive these days. It's 10 bucks to go see a movie. Uh, well, they are making a video game based on the dark

1132
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:57,760
night, uh

1133
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,920
And yeah, I know big surprise. That's not news, right?

1134
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,920
But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps

1135
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,080
It was actually gary oldman in an interview kind of uh spilled the beans that the game was coming out

1136
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:10,880
And it caused this whole like little controversy where a video was out and then it was pulled and now it's out again

1137
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:16,560
And all this other dumb stuff not to mention that was also leaked by ign before that. Well, I mean seriously, duh

1138
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,720
There's going to be a dark knight game duh

1139
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:24,000
Duh, duh, they've been making batman games ever since the old nes batman game, which was actually pretty rad

1140
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:28,240
The old batman game was awesome. The old batman game was awesome batman returns less awesome

1141
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,720
But the original batman game was pretty awesome and there's even lego batman and all this crap anyway

1142
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,740
But um the dark knight kind of funny enough. It was not there at e3

1143
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:43,140
Um, but it is still coming out and i'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the blu-ray release

1144
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:47,700
Uh of the movie and dvd release of the movie which will be you know in time for christmas

1145
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:53,300
I imagine uh gary oldman does is quoted in the video saying quote. It's hard to make a movie like this under the radar

1146
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,340
Game i'm assuming no he meant to say the movie, you know because the movie things go out

1147
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:03,220
But it's just kind of ironic because you know duh the game was coming right duh duh

1148
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,220
Uh

1149
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:08,340
So there you have it uh dark knight the game coming out soon

1150
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,020
Joy

1151
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:15,300
Anyway, um, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because i'm sick of hearing about it

1152
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,940
That's why I don't want to see it

1153
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,220
um

1154
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,020
What?

1155
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,060
I was gonna say

1156
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:22,660
It doesn't make it any worse of a movie though

1157
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:26,420
But I understand hype hype machine sometimes kills things and will kind of like, you know

1158
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:29,140
If you hear all this hype this hype this hype about something you need to watch it and you go

1159
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,500
It's good, but it's not great. And that's what a lot of people are saying about batman

1160
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:37,140
It's good, but it's not that great of all this hype. I didn't really care about seeing the last one either

1161
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:40,500
See, I just saw it at home as a batman fan

1162
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:44,500
I think they're far better than the schumacher films which were terrible terrible terrible

1163
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:48,500
These new yeah, they don't exist in my world, but these new ones not so bad

1164
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:52,900
In fact, really I I I thought this new one was long, but it was worth my time. It was good

1165
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:57,860
I agree with my husband. I won't see one until I get a soul, uh, uh a two-face only movie

1166
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:02,020
I don't want to say anything as a spoiler. I already know i'm just gonna back up for that

1167
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:06,260
But I will say this. I already know I also paid ten dollars to see mamma mia this week now that I would see

1168
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:10,660
And i'm going to see x files as soon as I get chance. I will only see mom. I'm sorry

1169
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,740
I'm sorry. I heard yeah, I heard the x files movies

1170
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:19,540
Not hot. I really don't it's fan service though. If you watch the show, you'll probably like it stay stay through the credits

1171
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,140
You don't want to miss that one. My my point is that

1172
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:28,740
My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it. So i'm gonna just see it for myself

1173
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,060
Fair enough. I won't see mamma mia again though until they let the audience sing along with the movie

1174
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,900
Were they

1175
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,340
Dexter game that's coming out for iphones. Do you remember us talking about that before?

1176
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:47,060
Um, actually, uh mark echo, um, who is a he does that clothing line and does graffiti

1177
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:52,340
um is actually uh supposed to be working with it, I do believe and um

1178
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:58,420
It's uh, his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an uh episodic content

1179
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:03,060
And as far as I know I do believe that uh, dextre is a a show about a serial killer

1180
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,700
Who is a uh splatter analysis for the miami police department?

1181
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,260
so, um

1182
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,860
He's uh

1183
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:16,340
It's a very interesting premise and I think that the the game has a good promise

1184
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:21,620
He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to

1185
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,300
but he doesn't want to

1186
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,300
So he kills serial killers

1187
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:29,940
That's extra special. It's on showtime, which means you know, it can be

1188
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:32,820
Which means I won't watch it

1189
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:37,540
Yeah, I think they've run it on cbs a couple times like during the rider strike and stuff when they needed programming

1190
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:41,380
But you know, it sounds like an it could be an interesting game interesting

1191
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:47,940
Keyword i'd just like to see it see what episodic content they're thinking of and the fact it's on the iphone of all things

1192
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,020
It's kind of it's interesting

1193
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,980
We'll see how it turns out. I guess tap here to murder

1194
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,900
Gold banjo and chat says I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome

1195
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:01,380
Well, no, I heard a lot of people like it. I just since I don't have show time. I don't really watch it

1196
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,540
Chat.orangelandraday.com if you want to comment

1197
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:08,580
Well last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that grand theft auto 4 was coming out on the pc

1198
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:15,140
Well now there's even more confirmation of this first starting off with the pc gamer magazine from malaysia. Yeah, I know that's not

1199
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:21,700
Exactly in the us or uk or whatever, but hey, it's on the cover. So that's got to say something, right?

1200
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:28,020
um, so they had a big little article about that and um also there was a um,

1201
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:34,660
Posting which is now removed on the esrb website. Apparently no one got the memo over at um,

1202
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:40,660
Rockstar games about the fact that you can delay when your um posting gets listed on there

1203
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:44,900
Oopsie, so it's more or less coming out. Of course

1204
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,300
Rockstar games is denying that they well, they're basically telling the truth

1205
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:53,220
We have made no announcements regarding a pc version of grand theft auto 4

1206
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,700
But yes, that is

1207
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,760
entirely accurate

1208
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,460
Um

1209
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:06,100
So, yeah, i'm sure it will be coming to pc. It's not a surprise all the like last few have so

1210
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,740
And this means hello hacking

1211
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:13,220
That's what i'm most interested in is all the mods for it. That'll be awesome skinning

1212
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:21,300
How many days let's make predictions how many days before grand theft auto 4 pc has a topless mod?

1213
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,640
Meaning all the women walk around topless

1214
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:27,380
10

1215
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:28,420
10

1216
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:33,060
I I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves like it'll get pirated before the game's even out

1217
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,220
And somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out

1218
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,860
There you have it

1219
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:44,500
All right. Well also, uh coming out and uh another port that's highly anticipated although of a completely different type

1220
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:48,820
It's the game peggle the popcap game. That's kind of like a plinko on crack

1221
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:50,740
Uh, I don't know if you played this game

1222
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:55,220
I really enjoy it on the ipod and I bet there would be a lot of ds people who like this game as well. Um

1223
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:01,940
Apparently though one at one time this game was denied by popcap as existing but popcap has come around and confirmed

1224
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,860
Yes, we are making a peggle ds game and it's coming out this winter

1225
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:11,300
Um, that's really all there is to say about it right now. But uh, hey, it's it's popcap. It's peggle

1226
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:14,740
That means you could already try it out for free probably on popcap.com

1227
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:18,020
I think this is one of their games you can try for free and you'll have a good idea what to expect

1228
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:23,540
On the ds later this year and it's fun, you know for a casual game. It's a lot of fun. It's stupidly simple

1229
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:28,020
You just fire a ball down the little you know playing field

1230
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:32,580
It's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although

1231
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:36,980
You know pinball has ramps and you know other things that peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat

1232
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:40,580
I enjoy peggle. It's a great ipod game. It's almost made for the ipod

1233
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,420
So, all right

1234
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:45,620
This is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us

1235
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:50,580
This is a little segment we have here on the show called the orange lounge radio mailbag every week

1236
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:56,340
You guys send us emails at mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark sakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them

1237
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,740
Right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in

1238
01:32:00,740 --> 01:32:03,140
So let's open up ye old mailbag and dark sakura

1239
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:06,020
Take it away

1240
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:11,140
Fresh email comes from azhp

1241
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:16,180
Hey, olr crew with all the talk about f-zero gx being one of the greatest racers on last week's show

1242
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:21,720
And eager anticipation of a wii title being announced. I figured i'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately

1243
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:26,980
Miyamoto went on record saying he wasn't he was extremely disappointed in how sega

1244
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:33,300
And how sega approached f-zero gx slash ax and that if f-zero were to be made for another console

1245
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,300
It would not be in the same style as gx

1246
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,820
This is probably because it was too difficult hard confusing

1247
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:42,740
But in my opinion, it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos

1248
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:46,420
That came with playing the game even at the rookie difficulty levels

1249
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:51,780
The game was critically acclaimed as well received higher than um, eight over ten for most game reviewers

1250
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:58,100
I um, I for one love love loved f-zero gx and i'm more than excited at the thought of another f-zero game

1251
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:01,380
Especially in hd, but unfortunately, it probably will never come to pass

1252
01:33:01,380 --> 01:33:05,460
Let's hope miyamoto comes to his senses and green lights this game because honestly

1253
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:11,620
How could anyone not like that game aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something keep up the great work in ps

1254
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:15,940
I went to disneyland for the first time in about 15 years and I now realize why you guys trip down there

1255
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,820
So often it really is a place where dreams come true

1256
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:22,900
Oh, I haven't been in like a year. So I don't have my past anymore. So

1257
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:29,700
Um, but yeah f-zero, I mean I I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because you know

1258
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,300
They don't think it'll work. I don't think of some stupid we feature to implement in it

1259
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:39,060
That'll make it worthwhile at least I hope I really hope because you know, you're right. It's critically acclaimed and uh,

1260
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:44,900
You know gamers that bought it loved it and I I just I hope they do it. I hope a miracle pulls through

1261
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:49,940
I hope a miracle pulls through i'm not going to hold my breath, but um, it would just be great

1262
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:53,300
Well, how about you miyamoto realize that?

1263
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,860
Maybe they should actually give gamers what they want

1264
01:33:56,180 --> 01:34:02,420
Wasn't there actually a dsf zero after ax gx? I still thought I thought there was I I could be wrong

1265
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:05,060
It might have been before but I seem to remember there was one after

1266
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,620
well, um

1267
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,740
next email

1268
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:13,700
Um, hi, olr and this comes from ritual insomnia actually j rod. Sorry. Oops. Sorry

1269
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:20,820
Um, first off I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones

1270
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:24,260
I work 10 hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on fridays

1271
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,660
So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make one days easier

1272
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:33,620
I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make you guys had your e3 wrap-up show, which was great

1273
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:39,460
But failed to even mention a huge huge title gears of war 2 i'm absolutely stoked for this game

1274
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:44,180
And you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at microsoft's keynote

1275
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:51,220
I actually didn't think about it. Sorry, um, this puts me in a position. I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not

1276
01:34:51,300 --> 01:34:53,300
Well, you can't get to the ferret so you can't

1277
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:58,260
Um, I mean you did make up for by having a discussion about the new, uh game silent hill

1278
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:06,020
Okay, you used game a bunch of times homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb stomping sequel

1279
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:10,260
How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support

1280
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:16,260
My uh, marcus says chainsaw dahlia. Gillespie says for me to be nice

1281
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:21,860
I don't know what to do with you people these emails sponsored by the olive garden home of the never-ending salads and breadsticks

1282
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,860
And i'll stop ripping off my signature fools

1283
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:30,500
Dude, seriously, it's not like I forgot about gears of war 2. I did not forget about gears of war 2 a lot of news

1284
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:36,260
I just didn't care. I honestly didn't fucking care. I hated gears of war 1 and gears of war 2. Guess what?

1285
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:39,700
I'm, not buying it and to be honest. I mean there's enough news out there

1286
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:43,540
Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of you know gears of war 2?

1287
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:49,940
No, I don't need to because guess what we didn't talk about every single demo that they have there. I mean, seriously

1288
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:54,820
I'm loling because i'm looking at the show roll and I see what story we have coming out of the mailbag tonight

1289
01:35:54,820 --> 01:35:58,740
That's funny. Well that that is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty of them

1290
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:03,060
It is funny and you know, we've mentioned plenty about gears of war 2 prior to that show. So

1291
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:07,140
That's what I had to say who gives a crap

1292
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:11,620
Well, bobby bobby makes a good point though in chat. He says gears of war 2 wasn't really at e3

1293
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,980
It was just at the keynote

1294
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:17,060
He says gears of war 2 will be playable at packs half of microsoft's booth will be gears 2

1295
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:21,620
So even though we did have the playthrough at packs, you know, not a lot of people or I mean i'm sorry at the e3

1296
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:27,780
Keynote we didn't have a lot of people. Um get hands-on impressions of the game and you know for for somebody like me

1297
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:32,420
Who's not quite as into that series? There's not a lot for me to say other than well

1298
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,580
It looks like the first one but better a little bit

1299
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:40,420
But I don't know I I know there were a lot of actually there were a lot of non-shooting people that were really into gears

1300
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,580
Of war 2 so who knows i'll give it a go

1301
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:45,300
I will give gears of war 2 a go, but i'm not going to buy it the day

1302
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:50,260
It comes out like I did gears of war 1, but I will check it out through a friend or something

1303
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,900
I'll make lowkey loamy his copy if he even buys it or something or I guess i'll just have to get a gamefly account

1304
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,020
I don't know

1305
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:00,660
But I just realized there was a lot a lot of e3 news next week some things fell through the cracks

1306
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:08,580
Next email, um, good sunday evening to you. Olr. I trust that. Everyone's been having a nice week so far

1307
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:14,500
Anyways, i'd like to say i'm kind of slow on catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my ipod

1308
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:21,460
Anymore, I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for olr

1309
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:28,340
Since the newer episodes are seven are 70 megabytes now i'm struggling to make ends meet on my ipod very nice format though

1310
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:31,140
When I heard the news about final fantasy 13

1311
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:37,400
Being a 360 release as well. I tried thinking of ps3 exclusives

1312
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:44,420
While the first party fair have been from decent, um motorstorm to best games i've ever played metal gear solid 4

1313
01:37:44,820 --> 01:37:48,260
I've yet to see many good third-party games. Hayes doesn't count

1314
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:54,260
Um, what i'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the ps3 by releasing original innovative games

1315
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,940
Not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for dlc ports

1316
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:05,240
Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off or is it the fact that more people own 360s?

1317
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:09,620
But I first can't wait for the naruto ps3 game coming out in october though

1318
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:16,120
One last thing with the addition of butterfly and ww and ddrx. I think that konami has gone too far and reminiscing

1319
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:17,640
um

1320
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:24,440
I mean sure those are a couple of the best songs ddr has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated

1321
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:31,000
Uh, the additions are like a slutty girlfriend. She may be nice and all but who hasn't done her

1322
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:37,320
That's funny. I mean any ddr player has played butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right?

1323
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,720
Why add it in a console version now?

1324
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,040
Well, that's all I have to say

1325
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:48,040
For the past few weeks and e3 while disappointing for some did have some very high points until next time katamari's forever

1326
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:51,800
This message brought to you by kenya home of the never-ending american ip addresses

1327
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,200
Well, i'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy

1328
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:01,160
Um, you know, obviously there's always gonna people love the idea and some people that don't like the idea

1329
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:07,400
I I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your ipod to make it work. I hope one way or another so

1330
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,040
That's what i'll have to say the rest of it, you know

1331
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,040
Good thoughts

1332
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,560
That's it there's more okay

1333
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:21,960
Um greetings everyone ron may uh here live from the laundromat show and some heart. Are you at the laundromat right now?

1334
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,400
No

1335
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,400
Yeah, well, no looking at the time

1336
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:29,960
Before I begin there's a few things i'd like to say to dark sakura

1337
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:34,840
Um, i've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit

1338
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:39,260
I truly loved and enjoyed everything words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality

1339
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:44,620
When you come to nyc, I will give that back to you a thousand fold. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you

1340
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,900
To rob. I wish we had more time to hang out not enough

1341
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:51,420
Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago and fyi

1342
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:54,380
Part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show

1343
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:58,620
As I said before when you come to new york city, I will give you that back

1344
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:01,280
Give that back to you a thousand fold because you're so fabulous

1345
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:05,340
To loki you're all right in my book too bad. We didn't get a chance to talk more and

1346
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:08,940
Uh and be more chill you were supposed to come join me and jamie for lunch

1347
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:10,940
Yeah, I did call you a couple times

1348
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:16,140
Um, I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay when you come out here to new york city

1349
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:19,180
I will show you a damn good time now on to some other things

1350
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:23,260
Oh, wow, this is a long email, sorry

1351
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,620
um

1352
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:30,060
I've said in the past. It would not surprise me that square enix would put final fantasy 12. He said 12

1353
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:37,040
I guess maybe means 13, um on xbox 360. Thank you screen x for saving my roommate 400 on a paperweight

1354
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:41,040
I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason

1355
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:43,940
I feel that konami will put metal gear solid 4 on the xbox 360

1356
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,000
I'm not saying that because i'm a drooling fanboy, but from a financial point of view

1357
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:53,600
The money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the ps3 due to the fact that it has

1358
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:58,320
A lower consumer home base and then the 360 that that was the point actually I agree with

1359
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:04,800
I'm putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles

1360
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,040
And speaking of konami people are calling for others to not support konami as a sad reality

1361
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,440
I understand where you're coming from about this though

1362
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,400
The whole lawsuit with konami versus viacom is not konami's fault

1363
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:19,600
You have to blame ad division about this because they're the ones paying licensing fees to them for guitar hero

1364
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:26,900
Everyone is saying that konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides bemani

1365
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:31,360
Konami has other titles such as will castlevania contra metal gear solid to name a few

1366
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:36,320
Also konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list

1367
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:38,560
um

1368
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,960
I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it. I like the gameplay screens

1369
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:47,280
And what annoys me more is that bemani fanboys girls

1370
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,760
Are going to foam at the mouth because of no guitar freaks drummania tracks in the game

1371
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,680
If konami added a lot of those tracks

1372
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:58,640
They would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game

1373
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,720
That's my two cents on it

1374
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,280
Any who keep up the good work and don't stop believing

1375
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:10,320
This email is brought to you by joey pisanos on mulberry street in the heart of little italy home of the 595 lunch specials

1376
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,160
You'll love pisanos

1377
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:17,840
And also by anime jam sessions the newest anime cosplay podcast cheap plug. Yep

1378
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,880
um

1379
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:23,200
Yeah, uh

1380
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,160
I I I like what black hole is saying in chat right now

1381
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:31,040
I'm, just reading does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see because that's one of the symbols

1382
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
No, I I don't agree with him that

1383
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,600
If you put some bow mai tracks in there that alienate, you know

1384
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:44,000
The people that were gonna buy it or whatever. Um, I mean look at some of the tracks that they have in guitar hero

1385
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:51,280
That are unlockables like their bonus tracks that are non-life either independent artists or you know, um

1386
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:53,920
at the time harmonics, um

1387
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:59,600
Artists like kind of like freeze pop and stuff. I mean i'm pretty sure freeze pop isn't main, you know

1388
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:05,440
A mainstream artist that everybody would love. I mean because some people find them annoying like me

1389
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:06,640
um

1390
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:14,400
And so some of the guitar hero tracks or guitar freaks tracks could easily be unlockable songs in that but no

1391
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:17,040
That would be you know

1392
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,480
Trying to even incorporate their old audience into it. Oh, well that

1393
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:25,760
That would be awful. I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game

1394
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:32,560
Whereas the other people may not buy your game. So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already

1395
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,960
To buy that game

1396
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:39,680
On the other topic. I agree with his reasoning for the final fantasy 13 on the xbox 360

1397
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,640
It just makes sense that they want to get up make sure they get all the development costs back

1398
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:46,160
By making sure they get a good share of the u.s

1399
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,000
marketplace

1400
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,360
Um marketplace, um, although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a playstation 3

1401
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,720
Just to get it for final fantasy. Um, 13 myself being one of them

1402
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,680
But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it

1403
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,400
So there you have it

1404
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,680
Any more emails tonight one one more

1405
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,640
Hey, olr

1406
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:11,600
Hi, i've been thinking about starting to play world of warcraft

1407
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:15,600
But the 15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget

1408
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,440
I would like everyone's opinion on whether it is whether or not it is worth

1409
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,100
The fee is guild wars or another mmorpg without a fee a viable alternative

1410
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:29,440
I heard that there are free private servers for world of warcraft as well. Are these legitimate? No

1411
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:33,200
They're not very good time. Keep on keeping on seth

1412
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:35,520
um

1413
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,840
I honestly world of warcraft. I got very burned on it very quickly

1414
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:44,080
I suggest if you can find like a a trial

1415
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,480
Try out a trial of it, you know, see how you like it

1416
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,400
But guild wars I think will be better for your money

1417
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,640
If you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already

1418
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:59,840
Or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free, uh, ragnarok online server

1419
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:05,200
I I agree though that guild wars is a viable alternative to world of warcraft. I mean, it's different

1420
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:09,920
You can't you can't say they're the same game because they're not the way they you know at glance

1421
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,400
They look the same and even at first kind of when you're first playing them

1422
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:16,800
You're like, oh there's a lot of similarities, but kind of the way the end game works is much different

1423
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:22,800
I mean guild wars is really, you know about guilds warring in the in the kind of final end stages

1424
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,800
There's only 20 levels in the game after all, um kind of a little more pvp-ish

1425
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,560
But I do think uh, you know warcraft is a lot of fun

1426
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,480
Obviously i've been playing it for a long long time

1427
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:37,280
But I mean if that's really all your gaming budget really going to warcraft in that case

1428
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:42,160
Um, I I would agree check out a demo you can get a demo for two dollars or if you know anybody

1429
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:47,440
Uh that is already in warcraft hell if you email me i'll get you a freaking code so you can download a 10-day demo

1430
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,360
Uh any player in the game can has access to be able to do it through the warcraft website

1431
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
And you can download the client online

1432
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,200
so

1433
01:45:55,200 --> 01:46:00,160
Very very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game

1434
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,800
and you know, I I actually I sort of had the thought of uh,

1435
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,800
Giving it one more go myself

1436
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,680
I mean I got really annoyed with it and but I figured if I you know

1437
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,040
And this is what I always do is that I play for a couple months and quit again

1438
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,840
so

1439
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,360
I guess being in school. I'm not gonna really have a whole lot of time to play but I was thinking of

1440
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:27,280
Maybe giving it another go just it got really boring blood elves are hot. They are

1441
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
But it got really boring

1442
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,680
Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time. Yeah, it was. Oh, I couldn't remember

1443
01:46:33,680 --> 01:46:40,720
I couldn't remember. I had just upgraded. Oh, wow. Okay. Remember? Yeah, that's right. I remember I remember. Yeah

1444
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,800
All right

1445
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,920
So that's it for the email then

1446
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,240
All right

1447
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:48,400
If you want to send us an email mailbag at orange launcher trader.com is the place to send those emails

1448
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,800
For now loki is going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic. Yes

1449
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:57,520
Uh, how ironic all of this, uh gears of war 2

1450
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,400
There's some new things been announced about it including that they're going to have some content

1451
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:06,560
For gears of war 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from gears of war 1

1452
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:13,040
And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had. So that's kind of neat

1453
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:19,760
And also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for halo 3

1454
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:24,560
which will be the 130 lancer bundle that will come with a

1455
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:29,920
Lancer, um, yes a miniature replica model of a lancer. What game is this again?

1456
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,200
Gears of war 2 i'm getting gears of war 2

1457
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:38,240
It's not the same kind of lancer that you're thinking of. It's a chainsaw gun

1458
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,440
I still want one

1459
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,320
All right, I like everything lancer, what about the whole achievements thing

1460
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:53,680
The whole achievements thing. Yeah. Yeah, I mentioned that. Oh, sorry. I spaced for a minute

1461
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,200
I don't know. What do you think of it though? It's an achievement horn. I think that's kind of cool

1462
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:00,720
Yeah, I think it's something they should implement in other games. It will get you to buy

1463
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:07,520
Some of their older games like gears of war especially for the achievement horror in all of this exactly you make the announcement now

1464
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,900
They just released that gears of war refresh time to buy your copy of that for like 39.99

1465
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,800
And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff. They used to do that kind of with um,

1466
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:26,000
Burnout actually remember um burnout like uh, three and stuff like that. They used to burn out revenge actually did this

1467
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:33,520
Um, if you had a game save for burnout 3 you got a car from burnout 3 and then also if you had a madden save

1468
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,240
Um, you got the madden van

1469
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,400
In burnout so interesting. I don't understand why they don't do this more often. But yeah, whatever

1470
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,200
All right

1471
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,080
Um

1472
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:47,600
Cool, I like the idea

1473
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,400
Uh, but I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements

1474
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:55,920
But one game I am definitely considering buying is mortal combat versus dc universe because I actually like mortal combat quite a bit

1475
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:59,440
And as even though i'm not as huge into comic books as some other people

1476
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:06,560
Um, I think the dc universe characters are pretty good and you know tons of people have joker fever right now because of you know

1477
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:12,080
The new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on lots of people

1478
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,000
Uh loving the joker right now

1479
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,720
And so it just was fitting that this week at comic con

1480
01:49:16,720 --> 01:49:22,800
It was announced that the joker has been added to the roster of characters for mortal combat versus dc universe

1481
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:29,040
Also, though it didn't stop there jax and katana from the mortal combat side are both confirmed for the game

1482
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:33,840
Which I think are kind of must-haves especially katana. Um, jax is a really cool character, too

1483
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:40,560
So i'm glad they have him there. Um also from the dc comics world green lantern is also going to be in the game

1484
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,920
That could be pretty cool. Maybe seals. So there you have it

1485
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:47,120
Um, now the question is since uh villains

1486
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:54,800
Supposedly could have fatalities even though heroes count because the whole dc comics rules could the joker kill people in the game

1487
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:56,320
I don't know

1488
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:57,760
I I don't

1489
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:02,640
I think even if their fatalities are going to be really um kind of softened down. You're not going to see any head ripping

1490
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:04,720
honestly

1491
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,320
If it's the joker

1492
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,320
You don't know what he's going to do

1493
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:13,040
I think that if they give him fatalities they either should or shouldn't go off at random

1494
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:17,760
Like like if he pulled out a gun it either blow their head off or like punch him with a big fist or something

1495
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,280
Nice idea. I like that or like say bang because this is the joker you don't know what he's going to do

1496
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,520
He does this to freak you out

1497
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:31,040
That's a good idea. That would that would be very joker and then you know, you could get like bang bang bang

1498
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:36,400
You know three things in a row and right when you think oh, it's not gonna happen. Boom headshot. So

1499
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,280
uh game guru, uh

1500
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:43,920
Uh, um hypothesizes the joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room. Um

1501
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:49,520
Zennane chat says jax was booed when he first came up at the panel. That's sad. Jax is cool

1502
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,520
He has mental arms because they he he's got his own fatality done on him somehow

1503
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,760
Oh

1504
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:02,560
I would like to say that I have some interesting news. Oh, really

1505
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,440
Yes, really and this makes me quite happy

1506
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:12,240
Um, although i'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned. Um, well that we don't have in show role

1507
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:16,240
But ties into this, uh, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago

1508
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,160
um

1509
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:23,520
there is actually um a rumor stating, um, and this actually, uh was going on at a

1510
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
san diego comic con 08, um

1511
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:29,120
marvel studios president of production

1512
01:51:29,120 --> 01:51:35,440
Um was saying, uh, well, they were actually asked if there would be another marvel versus capcom and he said yes

1513
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,440
And maybe sooner than you think

1514
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:44,400
So, but the other thing i've been reading is that when and you know, i've covered this on the show before um,

1515
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:51,520
Tatsunoko versus capcom which by the way, there's more stuff out more characters in it including a hurricane polymer

1516
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,800
kashan

1517
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:54,240
gachiman

1518
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,600
um

1519
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:57,600
The robot one I can never remember the name of

1520
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,600
um tekkeman

1521
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:04,480
And for for anyone who's like and also batsu is in it from rival schools. Um, uh,

1522
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,440
morrigan, um, just a bunch of you know characters

1523
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:13,840
But going back to the the marvel, uh versus capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um, the current test machines being out

1524
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:19,200
In japan for tatsunoko versus capcom that marvel was sort of like, uh, we want to make money off of this again

1525
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:24,640
Since you've got this brand new shiny fighting game engine. We want to use it, please

1526
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,240
Except we're sort of licensed out right now, but it would still be nice

1527
01:52:29,680 --> 01:52:30,800
Please

1528
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,600
Aj mixx wants to see some power stone characters

1529
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:38,320
There actually from what I understand they have a uh for tatsunoko versus capcom

1530
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,800
And actually if you give me a second i'll get the character list for you real quick

1531
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:46,080
Um, the actual full trailer of for tatsunoko versus capcom is actually up on um youtube right now

1532
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,080
You can find it easy just looking up tatsunoko versus capcom, but give me just a quick sec

1533
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,640
I just think the whole thing is interesting. I I this always makes me laugh how you have, you know

1534
01:52:54,800 --> 01:53:00,480
The street fighter and mortal combat were always kind of like these two, you know competing franchises in the fighting game world

1535
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:04,960
And you have dc comics and and marvel or the two in the comic world

1536
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:10,320
It's just really funny how the cards fell and you always have marvel versus capcom and now you have mortal combat versus dc

1537
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:14,800
Finally after kind of all these years when you would think this team-up would have happened a while sooner

1538
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:21,600
Okay, so far I don't have the the full list of everything. Um, okay here's what we have so far for the list of tatsunoko

1539
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:28,640
Versus capcom characters. We have um, awashi no ken who is a g1 for gachaman. Um, kashan from uh,

1540
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:35,920
The kashan anime tekaman from tekaman the space knight yataman number one from yachaman hurricane polymer

1541
01:53:36,240 --> 01:53:40,160
and uh gold light on from golden warrior gold light on and from um,

1542
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:46,480
Capcom, there's ryu chun li batsu from rival schools alex from street fighter 3 morgan from um

1543
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:49,440
Darkstalkers and silky from onimusha dawn of dreams

1544
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:55,120
So it's actually on location test. Um in tokyo right now. Um,

1545
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:00,640
And hopefully i've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more. Um,

1546
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:05,360
As far as an actual release date soon. In fact, i'm pulling up another

1547
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:12,160
Uh list here that they're saying a december 2008 actual release window. So that's fairly cool

1548
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:14,640
I hope they they add more characters, though

1549
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:20,240
I really do but the poster though seems to be pretty finalized the one that they've got out now

1550
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:25,840
All right, i'm just surprised I I want speed racer as a hidden character

1551
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:28,880
That was a tatsunoko production thing

1552
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:36,400
Lord katsuhito in chat says tatsunoko versus capcom could come to the u.s. It just depends on who holds what license to which tatsunoko anime

1553
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,920
Still is going to be a pain in the ass though, you know either way

1554
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,880
So, you know what?

1555
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,040
I i'm gonna import it no matter what so

1556
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,040
got to

1557
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:51,840
You love gachaman and all those other characters. I I would not that news does not surprise me one bit

1558
01:54:51,840 --> 01:55:00,080
All right, um, well if you have been following core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the playstation network

1559
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,960
You'll probably have figured out that

1560
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:10,400
If you have purchased the I want to say the august version of core and whatever one just came out

1561
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,840
You'll actually be able to get into the

1562
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:22,320
Resistance 2 beta this september and um, also there will be some other ways to get in besides that

1563
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:30,080
According to my resistance dot net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game

1564
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,080
And they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon

1565
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:38,080
But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access

1566
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:44,240
But if you want to get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access, you can get in early access

1567
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:50,800
But if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new naruto game

1568
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:53,520
But you get into um the resistance beta

1569
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:56,800
Huh

1570
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:01,600
I I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing. That's been very popular lately, you know

1571
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,840
Whatever happened to the good old, uh fashions, you know

1572
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:06,480
sign up for it

1573
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,840
You know, it doesn't go out to the public at all. It's just friends and family, even that.

1574
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:10,760
I don't know, it's a little silly.

1575
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:12,280
The pain for demos have been around for a long time.

1576
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:15,760
Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation Magazine to get your demo disc?

1577
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,880
Doesn't mean I like it.

1578
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,120
Doesn't mean I like it one bit.

1579
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:25,560
Do you, will you sign up for, you like Resistance, will you sign up for a core membership?

1580
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:30,120
No, because it's a 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer.

1581
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:33,680
I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested.

1582
01:56:34,720 --> 01:56:35,600
Well, then there you go.

1583
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:39,720
All right, well, I think we need to get, give out an award for stupidity.

1584
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:49,040
Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that.

1585
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,480
It's much easier this week.

1586
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:55,520
It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC.

1587
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,560
Congratulations, you're the wiener of the stupid award this week.

1588
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:06,880
Here's why. It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle.

1589
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:12,360
Now, I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle,

1590
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:17,840
as long as they use, you know, figures or sales or even history, for God's sake.

1591
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:24,240
I don't care, but here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war.

1592
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:29,040
It's because her son said so. Her 16-year-old son said so.

1593
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:34,840
He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened.

1594
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:38,040
He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed.

1595
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:43,840
After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4 as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline and the awesomeness of Blu-ray,

1596
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:49,440
he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in.

1597
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:54,040
As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you at the PlayStation.

1598
01:57:54,040 --> 01:57:55,840
Neither did I, he replied.

1599
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:02,040
Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that,

1600
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:07,240
that he kept on top of all the stuff going on in the industry.

1601
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:13,840
I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out.

1602
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:19,840
I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion.

1603
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:27,840
I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact, kind of.

1604
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:33,840
I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war.

1605
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,840
I don't know. Either way, it's retarded.

1606
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:40,840
And this shouldn't be reported on CNBC.

1607
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:45,840
Which is Financial Investor Network. That's the problem I have with it.

1608
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:51,840
And the whole thing sounds like a big old, you know, I want a PSP for Christmas thing.

1609
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:58,840
Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next.

1610
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:14,840
Music

1611
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:23,840
I would like to say F you to whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition.

1612
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:26,840
My grandmom is in the hospital right now.

1613
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:29,840
It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that.

1614
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:33,840
I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her.

1615
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:41,840
And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, in other people.

1616
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,840
And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on.

1617
01:59:46,840 --> 01:59:50,840
So, you know, I guess genetics, too, have something to do with it.

1618
01:59:50,840 --> 01:59:59,840
But I just, you know, F you to the fact that my grandmom's in the hospital, that there's something wrong that required her to be there in the first place.

1619
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:01,840
Well, I hope she gets better.

1620
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,840
Well, I'm sure she will. She's going in for surgery on Tuesday.

1621
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:06,840
And I'll tell you guys more often.

1622
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:08,840
Sure, that's fine.

1623
02:00:08,840 --> 02:00:09,840
Alright, Loki.

1624
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,840
F you to people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people.

1625
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:17,840
Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use?

1626
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:22,840
And I'm like, no. I don't own a cell phone at all.

1627
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:24,840
So, get the fuck off.

1628
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,840
That's it.

1629
02:00:26,840 --> 02:00:38,840
Speaking of genetics, I guess I'm going to also give a similar F you tonight because it looks more and more likely that I am going to have my gallbladder taken out later this year as part of the reason why I have my whole pancreas issues in the first place.

1630
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:42,840
And although it's not a big deal, a lot of people have had it done. It's pretty common right now.

1631
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:48,840
It just... surgery sucks. Period. So, I'm not looking forward to that.

1632
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:53,840
And that means that I am going to be out of Orange Lawn's radio for probably two weeks at some time in the fall.

1633
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:57,840
I don't know when, but that will be coming up where I'm not going to be able to do the show for a couple weeks.

1634
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:05,840
So, it's too early to speak to what's going to happen during that period, but it's going to happen.

1635
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:08,840
So, wait for it.

1636
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,840
F you to that.

1637
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,840
Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news.

1638
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,840
DarkSakura, what you got for us? Come next.

1639
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,840
Oh, just some stuff.

1640
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:22,840
Cool. I like stuff.

1641
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:29,840
Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked?

1642
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:40,840
Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock remixes are actually going to be...

1643
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:44,840
And this is just going to give me a second, because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze.

1644
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:53,840
But some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD remix.

1645
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:56,840
At least as far as I can see on here.

1646
02:01:56,840 --> 02:02:04,840
So, I think that's pretty cool. They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on their remixes.

1647
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:08,840
DJ Pretzel, we've actually had a few of the stuff on here.

1648
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:17,840
Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley, I guess I don't see a nickname for him, but I think that's pretty cool.

1649
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:22,840
They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the game itself.

1650
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:28,840
I agree, that is pretty cool. Kudos to Capcom. You're doing a lot of stuff right this year. Good for you.

1651
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,840
I figured it out.

1652
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:35,840
Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon.

1653
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:47,840
You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month.

1654
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:51,840
Well now, what if it's Nintendo holding onto it? What if it's Nintendo's fault?

1655
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,840
Oh wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault. That's just lies.

1656
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,840
That's what I thought.

1657
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:06,840
But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.

1658
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:14,840
Players of course will be able to control both animated characters and hilarity will ensue from there.

1659
02:03:14,840 --> 02:03:24,840
No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series.

1660
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,840
So, that's kind of neat.

1661
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:29,840
Episodic gaming is the wave of the future.

1662
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,840
Hey, over at Telltale, yeah, that's kind of where they make their bread and butter.

1663
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:37,840
But you know you're in good hands over there, so that's going to be very interesting I think.

1664
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,840
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to our Skype line at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

1665
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:47,840
Click on interact with us for all the details. It's OrangeLaungeRadio is our username on Skype or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1666
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:55,840
But first, one last story, and it has to do for those of you guys, you know, if you are in the OL Army on Facebook, then maybe you're a Scrabulous player.

1667
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:59,840
But the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally.

1668
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:06,840
Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game.

1669
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:15,840
Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January.

1670
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:24,840
So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on the folks that have created the Scrabulous game and is demanding that Facebook pull the application immediately.

1671
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,840
They even put out a whole little press release on it.

1672
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:30,840
It should be noted, one interesting part I kind of liked in the press release here is it says,

1673
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:38,840
between the classic board game, Facebook, Pogo, the iPod, and the iPhone, our members can now play their favorite game virtually anytime, anywhere.

1674
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:44,840
Alluding to the fact that there is an actual Scrabble application on Facebook that people seem to not be using as much.

1675
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:47,840
Maybe because Scrabulous was already kind of out there at the time.

1676
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:54,840
So, I mean, the lawsuit kind of makes sense, I hate to say it, but if you've played Scrabulous, it's Scrabble.

1677
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:57,840
There's no denying that.

1678
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:00,840
But at the same time, it got old.

1679
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,840
Like, I know there's a lot of people that play Scrabulous on Facebook.

1680
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:05,840
I played it like once or twice, and I'm like, okay, bored now.

1681
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:10,840
I mean, Scrabble's fun, I think, in person, but not quite as fun over the internet for me.

1682
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,840
That's just my opinion.

1683
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,840
Are you a Scrabulous player at Dark Sakura?

1684
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:17,840
Sometimes.

1685
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:19,840
Yeah? Alright, that's cool.

1686
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,840
I mean, it's a fun word game, but I don't know, it got old for me.

1687
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,840
It's always the same people I want to play to.

1688
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:28,840
And then, you know, when I first installed the application, I got like all these invites to play a game,

1689
02:05:28,840 --> 02:05:32,840
and I just, you know, I can only handle like one game at a time, alright?

1690
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:33,840
Alright.

1691
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:38,840
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1692
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:43,840
The Skype line is now open for business.

1693
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,840
Hi, OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1694
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,840
Hey, it's LordKatsuhito.

1695
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:50,840
Is it now? What, you changed the name tonight?

1696
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:54,840
Are you referring to that in the Jedi sense?

1697
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:56,840
Maybe.

1698
02:05:56,840 --> 02:05:59,840
Do not start singing the Bughram song.

1699
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:01,840
So, Rama, you already had an email read tonight.

1700
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:03,840
This phone call better be good. What's up?

1701
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,840
I want to talk about Fat Princess.

1702
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:09,840
I want to discuss this game, okay?

1703
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:10,840
Please do.

1704
02:06:10,840 --> 02:06:13,840
That alone makes me want to drop the 400 bucks for a PlayStation 3.

1705
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,840
Really? Why?

1706
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,840
The game looks fun. I'm sorry.

1707
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:26,840
It looks fun. I've spent money on frivolous things, but that'd be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game.

1708
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:32,840
And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up. I mean, really.

1709
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:40,840
Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure.

1710
02:06:40,840 --> 02:06:44,840
Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360.

1711
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:49,840
Not the sole reason, but a big reason. I would say Xbox Live in general was.

1712
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:56,840
It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way.

1713
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,840
Sure, go for it.

1714
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:01,840
The feminists are bitching them on about Fat Princess?

1715
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:06,840
I mean, where were they when all these games were coming out where the hero had to go rescue their heroine?

1716
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,840
Where were they? They didn't say Jack. They said nothing.

1717
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:18,840
Now the game with a fat cat, now they run their mouths? Feminists, gaming feminists are a bunch of fucking hypocrites. That's it.

1718
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:27,840
I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times. Why not? Why not?

1719
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:29,840
Just kind of throwing that idea out there.

1720
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:33,840
And then roll her over one of those switches in the dungeon to solve a puzzle.

1721
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:35,840
No, no, no. You know what, though? I would like to see more.

1722
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:39,840
Why not? If we're going to go for diversity in this sense, let's go for diversity all around the board.

1723
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:45,840
But this just goes into the whole fact where we need more gay people in games, we need more people of color in games, we need, you know.

1724
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:49,840
There's a simple solution. Everyone, get over it.

1725
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,840
Be more open-minded.

1726
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:59,840
I'm never going to stop playing games, but it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like to's, and I'll still play Fat Princess.

1727
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:01,840
No.

1728
02:08:01,840 --> 02:08:03,840
Alright, any other thoughts, Rama?

1729
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,840
Don't stop believing.

1730
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,840
Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend.

1731
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:13,840
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be.

1732
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:19,840
Let's see, comments in chat.

1733
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:23,840
GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.

1734
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:27,840
Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke, let it be.

1735
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:41,840
You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it, this offends me, and then bitch.

1736
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,840
I don't like it, this offends me.

1737
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:51,840
Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easy going and go with the goddamn flow?

1738
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:59,840
I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things.

1739
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:01,840
Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work.

1740
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:07,840
That's a good thing, you know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like.

1741
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,840
You don't have to have a hissy.

1742
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:15,840
Just say, I don't like this, and then get over it.

1743
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:19,840
You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something, I don't know.

1744
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:26,840
Some comments in chat, SSJ100Matt says, maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles.

1745
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:27,840
Why do you think she wears that dress?

1746
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,840
Um, Shaoran, it's a slimming dress.

1747
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:34,840
Shaoran says, we need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.

1748
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:37,840
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1749
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,840
Nah, it's Legend of Zaku.

1750
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,840
Hey, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

1751
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:45,840
Uh, nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all.

1752
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:47,840
Yesterday's what party?

1753
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:53,840
Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, masses of rock band, lots of booze.

1754
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:56,840
I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party?

1755
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:58,840
Because you don't have a party without rock band.

1756
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:00,840
Alright, then it officially was a party.

1757
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:04,840
Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band.

1758
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:06,840
And I left after an hour and a half.

1759
02:10:06,840 --> 02:10:10,840
But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia.

1760
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:13,840
And that got me to stay as long as I did.

1761
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:15,840
Because lumpia, good stuff.

1762
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,840
Anyway, sorry Zaku, I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food.

1763
02:10:18,840 --> 02:10:21,840
What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight?

1764
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:25,840
Well, let me see, the whole, I'm trying to think right now.

1765
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:31,840
The fact of the matter that, you know, Street Fighter IV and, you know, the state of the arcades in this country.

1766
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:37,840
The fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machine.

1767
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:48,840
But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore.

1768
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:52,840
Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami.

1769
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,840
And, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too.

1770
02:10:54,840 --> 02:10:56,840
I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven?

1771
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,840
And DDR of course, they a little more forgiven?

1772
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:00,840
Well, that's DDR, that's an exception.

1773
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:05,840
You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades.

1774
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:15,840
And then all of a sudden, you know, especially in America, you know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved.

1775
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,840
I would say true statement because Street Fighter II, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades.

1776
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:24,840
It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo.

1777
02:11:24,840 --> 02:11:29,840
It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge, 15 years ago even.

1778
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:38,840
And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, doing, making efforts to, like, help.

1779
02:11:38,840 --> 02:11:46,840
Instead of, you know, instead of just beating around the budget saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only.

1780
02:11:46,840 --> 02:11:52,840
How come these arcade, here's a question, how come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades?

1781
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:58,840
I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades.

1782
02:11:58,840 --> 02:11:59,840
I wonder why not.

1783
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,840
Well, think about it, it's a risk.

1784
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:09,840
You see the current state of, you know, the current state of the economy right now and how gas is, like, ridiculously expensive.

1785
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,840
People are trying to save as much money as possible.

1786
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:18,840
So, the first things to go in tough times like these is entertainment.

1787
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:21,840
I guess I can see that.

1788
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:29,840
And the fact that, you know, the consoles have pretty much given, you know, given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out.

1789
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,840
Because they're out doing the graphics.

1790
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:36,840
I guess I can see that.

1791
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:38,840
Well, I don't know, what do you think the answer is?

1792
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:41,840
When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever?

1793
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,840
What's it going to take?

1794
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:48,840
It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

1795
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:50,840
That's a good saying.

1796
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:55,840
It takes effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games.

1797
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:58,840
Capcom, Konami, you know, the others.

1798
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:07,840
They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades.

1799
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:10,840
The ones that are struggling just to get by.

1800
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:12,840
At least help them out a little bit.

1801
02:13:12,840 --> 02:13:13,840
Alright.

1802
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:16,840
Zaku, anything else you want to share with listeners tonight?

1803
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:20,840
Um, let me see.

1804
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:31,840
Yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole, you know, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it.

1805
02:13:31,840 --> 02:13:32,840
It's done.

1806
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:36,840
It's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference.

1807
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:38,840
Like, you were going to buy it anyways.

1808
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:40,840
I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it.

1809
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:42,840
Here in the studio.

1810
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:45,840
I know, it's like old news, I'm thinking of that, I should have brought it yesterday.

1811
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,840
It's alright.

1812
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:47,840
Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse.

1813
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:48,840
It's alright.

1814
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:49,840
Just to remind you it's dead.

1815
02:13:49,840 --> 02:13:51,840
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.

1816
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:52,840
Have a good one, buddy.

1817
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:53,840
Bye.

1818
02:13:53,840 --> 02:13:54,840
Later.

1819
02:13:54,840 --> 02:14:00,840
Oh, it's some New York, it's New York night on the Skypline.

1820
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:01,840
That was two New Yorkers in a row.

1821
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:02,840
Yep.

1822
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:03,840
I haven't been to New York in a while.

1823
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:04,840
It's been at least a year.

1824
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:05,840
It's time for me to go back.

1825
02:14:05,840 --> 02:14:07,840
It's been about 12 years for me.

1826
02:14:07,840 --> 02:14:08,840
You need to go.

1827
02:14:08,840 --> 02:14:10,840
We need to, we need to storm the big city.

1828
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:11,840
Be fun.

1829
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:12,840
Literally storm through it.

1830
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:15,840
As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it.

1831
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:18,840
We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there.

1832
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:19,840
We'll see.

1833
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:20,840
Someday.

1834
02:14:20,840 --> 02:14:25,840
If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

1835
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:28,840
We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon.

1836
02:14:28,840 --> 02:14:30,840
But first, some more calls.

1837
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:31,840
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

1838
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:32,840
Who's this?

1839
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:35,840
It's GS68 and I just broke the streak of New York gamers.

1840
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:37,840
You're not from New York.

1841
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,840
No, what's up?

1842
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:43,840
Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it.

1843
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:53,840
One way to do that would be to lower game prices because these days, what typical gamer in the right mind would pay more than 25 or 50 cents to play an arcade game?

1844
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:56,840
Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much.

1845
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:01,840
But isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive?

1846
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:11,840
I suppose. I mean, as much in... I hate to bring in Minnesota again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs.

1847
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:15,840
I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know?

1848
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:20,840
But then everybody would know it's a budget cab and people would go, oh, this one's lame. It's not as good as the other one.

1849
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:26,840
You know what an awesome cab was? It was F-Zero AX. That was a brilliant cabinet. That was so fun.

1850
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:35,840
Yeah, but look at time crisis for the majority of like the cab... time crisis for cabinets are small cabinets and people don't have a big problem with that.

1851
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:53,840
Yeah. I don't know. Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom?

1852
02:15:53,840 --> 02:16:03,840
And then, what else? I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games like in the 70s and 80s.

1853
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:13,840
Nowadays, it's the other way around. I mean, could you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that?

1854
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:21,840
You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face. A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else. That would be something.

1855
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:26,840
Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down. That'd be fun.

1856
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:37,840
Well, some good arcadets going to the arcade is in itself a unique experience. I mean, at home you'd have to bring friends over to have a huge ass party.

1857
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:46,840
And then there's online, but there's something about meeting your opponents in person that online doesn't have.

1858
02:16:46,840 --> 02:16:52,840
Hmm. I suppose. Alright. Uh, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go?

1859
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:53,840
Um, no.

1860
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:57,840
Alright. Have a good one, buddy, and good luck. I hope the arcades do come full circle someday.

1861
02:16:57,840 --> 02:16:58,840
Alright. Thank you.

1862
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:05,840
Buh-bye. Because I miss arcades too, you know. 877-GameOLR username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio. We'll do one more call tonight.

1863
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:07,840
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1864
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:09,840
Hi, this is Akdeft.

1865
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,840
Hey, Akdeft. What's on your mind, buddy?

1866
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:22,840
Oh, I have, uh, news here about, uh, a guy who marathoned, like, 26 hours and a half, uh, playing the drums on rock band.

1867
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:28,840
He played rock band drums for 26 hours and- 26 and a half hours? Did his arm fall off?

1868
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:31,840
Um, fortunately, not.

1869
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:33,840
Wow, is he playing on hard mode?

1870
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:40,840
He was playing on expert. Uh, he's actually a freak from the score hero forums. He's a staff member there.

1871
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:45,840
Uh. What did- what was the point? Was it charity or what?

1872
02:17:45,840 --> 02:18:00,840
Just have fun, basically. He- he did, uh, something for charity, though. Uh, it wasn't that, um, how do you say it? Big? Because they- he only got to, like, $200.

1873
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:15,840
Well, still, charity's charity. That's still pretty cool, though. Um, and speaking of charity and these marathon things, man, they're happening- thanks to sites like Justin.tv and Ustream and all these other sites, man, it seems like there's a gaming charity event happening every weekend somewhere.

1874
02:18:15,840 --> 02:18:28,840
In fact, I actually visited a website, and I'm sorry, I don't remember the URL, but I'm sure someone in chat will jump in there with it. There's actually a website out there somewhere, like, it's like gamemarathons.com or something, that show you, hey, these are all the marathons going on this weekend if you want to go watch people play some games.

1875
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:56,840
Kind of interesting. I think it's more fun to play games, but then at the same time, I've always thought we here at OLR should do one of those for fun one time. Like, I think a fun game tournament that we- or not game tournament, game marathon we should do, is that- and I think this was kind of an idea we talked about kind of a little bit in circle on the show, is go to Jamie's, and in her big game archive, we'll pick games, and every hour, the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next, but they're, like, obscure shit. Like, no Mario, no Zelda.

1876
02:18:56,840 --> 02:18:58,840
What the hell do you think I have in the vault?

1877
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:04,840
Exactly, we're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault, is what we would play all marathon long. Do you think people would be into that?

1878
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:06,840
Yeah, that would be cool.

1879
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:10,840
I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out.

1880
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:13,840
I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you.

1881
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:27,840
Yes, that too. But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off. We'll have to think about it. Maybe for- if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend, maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something, I don't know. Just throwing ideas out there. Some three day weekend, we'll have to see.

1882
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:56,840
Basically, the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh cool, sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band.

1883
02:19:56,840 --> 02:20:12,840
And it makes me kind of pissed because even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure playing Expert, all the songs, even the download continent, so it's like-

1884
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:31,840
I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and whatever website ran stories on this and whatever. My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror. You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills.

1885
02:20:31,840 --> 02:20:45,840
No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band. If you think you're any better than the guy playing rock band, guess what? You're worse. The end.

1886
02:20:45,840 --> 02:21:01,840
Indeed, I agree with that. There is no counter argument to that. You are worse than the guy playing rock band, which, you know what, if it makes him happy, I think he, play it for 48 hours next time. I support it.

1887
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:15,840
He did say that he might try on December to do that again with all the download continent that is going to be released until then. So that would be cool.

1888
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:31,840
Alright, act deft. Thank you so much for the call and party on with rock band. Take a good one. Have a good one, buddy. Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories. Dark Soccer by chance?

1889
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:46,840
I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors? And apparently there's even video now. Apparently, you know how Darth Vader was supposed to be exclusive to PlayStation 3 Soul Calibur? Apparently not.

1890
02:21:46,840 --> 02:22:01,840
Apparently, he's actually showing up in videos now for the 360 version and vice versa. So, because you know people are breaking street on that and everything. So, kind of not a big surprise honestly, but it looks like Vader will be playable after all in 360 and vice versa for Yoda and the PS3.

1891
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:11,840
Now you might have to pay for download content, but it's available. It's available. Loki, anything for you?

1892
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:25,840
I don't think I have really much of anything. There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground. It kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious. Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake. So, that's kind of interesting.

1893
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:31,840
Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2.

1894
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:33,840
Talk about stunt casting.

1895
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:42,840
Really, I just think they want some of the big tits on their cover. I support that fully. Let's see here.

1896
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:46,840
Don't care.

1897
02:22:46,840 --> 02:23:01,840
Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st and what's kind of cool about it is it will have the character creator with it and you can actually share those characters that you create online and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September. So, that's kind of neat.

1898
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:11,840
Let's see. Yeah, I think that's about it.

1899
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:21,840
Amazeatsuma in chat has a good point. Says, Sky paid for download content. It's Namco so it will be paid to unlock content. It's old caliber. You're probably right.

1900
02:23:21,840 --> 02:23:33,840
BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader. I'll just pay $60. Okay, thanks. Well, I'll pay $60 and then maybe the $10 and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with.

1901
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,840
Just messing.

1902
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:49,840
Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun.

1903
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:59,840
But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio. I will start tonight. And my final thought is I want a snack. I want snacky foods.

1904
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:09,840
Yogurt. I want frozen yogurt. That would be really good. Oh my God, Rob. That's not really good. That's my final thought too. I want frozen yogurt. Let's go get some. We can't. They all close at nine.

1905
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:19,840
Well, screw that. Let's go to the grocery store. I do need to go to the grocery store though. Loki, your final thought? I don't know. I don't have anything.

1906
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:30,840
Alright. Wow. OLR PSP is still being worked on. I just have a lot of small things I haven't finished. But it is, I've been working on it quite heavily so soon.

1907
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:43,840
Alright. Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and downloading our podcast. We really appreciate it. Again, all we ask if you enjoy the show, you hear. If you like what you're hearing, we are an independent podcast.

1908

We do not have thousands of marketing dollars. In fact, we have zero dollars to work with. We don't have a big magazine backing us or a big gaming website or anything. We really struggle to connect with viewers like you.

02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:08,840
So please tell two people you know about the show and slowly through word of mouth, Orange Lawns Radio will spread like a bad STD. But a lot nicer to have.

1910
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:15,840
So anyway, thank you guys so much for listening to us. We'll see you next week with more of what you've come to love here on Orange Lawns Radio.

1911
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:27,840
And again, if you are listening on the podcast, you want to leave some comments, you can always send us an email. Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or leave us a voicemail which we still need to catch up on or post on our website at the forums at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1912
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:46,840
Until then, this is Rob, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we are Orange Lawns Radio. See you next week.

1913
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:06,840
See you next week.
