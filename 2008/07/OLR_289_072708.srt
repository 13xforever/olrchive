1
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight, July 27th, 2008, will some Nintendo controllers soon be banned?

2
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Is an official HaloCon in the near future?

3
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:24,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And a PC gaming service has gone free?

4
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:35,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:40,873
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast on the internet dedicated to video games, video gaming, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

6
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:47,078
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron, Tron.

8
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can see what you're excited about out of Comic-Con.

9
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:54,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy, happy, happy, happy.

10
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:54,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's this?

11
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making a new Tron.

12
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:56,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

13
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:57,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Tron 2.

14
00:00:57,872 --> 00:00:58,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jeff Bridges is in it.

15
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I saw that in the trailer.

16
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:01,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And he looks evil.

17
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:02,694
[SPEAKER_03]: What was up with that trailer though?

18
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:05,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Like somebody shot it with a camera phone like a million miles away.

19
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:07,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Disney wouldn't let anything be filmed.

20
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:07,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Buena Vista would.

21
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:35,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

22
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember?

23
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember that.

24
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:40,256
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I would use that as sort of a past precedent.

25
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but still, what are they going to do?

26
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:44,321
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like thousands of people at Comic-Con.

27
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:44,922
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

28
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:45,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially in those panels.

29
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:50,228
[SPEAKER_13]: As far as I can tell, though, this cell phone video was the only thing that I've seen.

30
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:51,250
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

31
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:52,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

32
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:53,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whatever they're doing, it works.

33
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:55,105
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've never been to Comic-Con.

34
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:55,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe next year.

35
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:56,947
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going next year.

36
00:01:57,167 --> 00:02:00,009
[SPEAKER_03]: The one and only Miglatov, you've probably heard on this show.

37
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:00,730
[SPEAKER_03]: He was at Comic-Con.

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,731
[SPEAKER_03]: He was giving me calls pretty much every day.

39
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:05,373
[SPEAKER_03]: He got his picture with Siler and just had to rub it in my face.

40
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:10,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet he was intensely... Wasn't he sort of stalking him for a little while?

41
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:10,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, kind of.

42
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:12,398
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

43
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:15,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of jerks, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

44
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:16,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

45
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:17,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

46
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:18,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing fine.

47
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you just watching that little preview for Tron 2?

48
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:25,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I had to because I was reading up on it, but I didn't know that they actually had filmed it.

49
00:02:25,766 --> 00:02:30,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you have to assume that anything that says do not film, someone's going to film it.

50
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:30,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

51
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:33,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially something as widely anticipated as that.

52
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, just think about it.

53
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,032
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll make a great video game, except then again, there was a Tron 2.0 video game.

54
00:02:39,052 --> 00:02:39,812
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't stop anybody.

55
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:40,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't do very well.

56
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:42,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they should go ahead and try again.

57
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:51,398
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a better freeware or shareware light cycle game out though on the internet that someone did and Dan was playing it for a while.

58
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really, really good.

59
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:52,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

60
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,501
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Surround on the Atari 2600.

61
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:56,661
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just light cycles.

62
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:57,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that.

63
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:09,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, if you want to join us in our chat room, we are live in the chat room on this lovely Sunday evening that we're taping July the 27th of 2008 on episode number 289 of our podcast, Damn World.

64
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to be if you want to

65
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:15,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Join in with the chat.

66
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:19,415
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just trying to look at some of the comments in chat right now.

67
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:24,737
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are just kind of making fun of the whole do not copy policy and all that stuff.

68
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:33,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are commenting about how during the previous show, the Bobby Blackwolf show on All Games Radio, Loki could not contain his foul mouth on the family programming that was the Bobby Blackwolf show.

69
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people in there commenting on that.

70
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:38,162
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to hear that, you've got to listen to Bobby's show though.

71
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,662
[SPEAKER_03]: He's available at allgames.com.

72
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:41,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on Bobby Blackwolf show.

73
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:42,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming Week

74
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I played stuff, actually.

75
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,679
[SPEAKER_13]: I did finally start Aurora Faint.

76
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,561
[SPEAKER_13]: And that game's freaking cool!

77
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:15,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about this game.

78
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about Aurora Fate.

79
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:17,767
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an iPhone game.

80
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, okay.

81
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:26,533
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of like how Bejeweled does, except you can only move them horizontally.

82
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:30,276
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can sort of slide as you destroy groups.

83
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:32,938
[SPEAKER_13]: They fall off sort of like how Puyo Puyo does.

84
00:04:33,378 --> 00:04:39,142
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can actually move blocks off to the side and move them that way, move them laterally into empty spaces.

85
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:41,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's sort of a neat thing, and

86
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:48,762
[SPEAKER_13]: You can level up and learn new techniques and it's a very cool little game and very pretty and shiny.

87
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:58,978
[SPEAKER_13]: and I played this other thing called Color Spiral, but all it is is just drawing really awful circles on the iPhone, so it sucks.

88
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:01,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And I got a Sudoku game, just to try it.

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I got, it's just called Sudoku Free, and it actually, it's kind of neat, really, you know, easy.

90
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:10,065
[SPEAKER_13]: As in, really easy.

91
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:11,946
[SPEAKER_13]: As in, eh.

92
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:15,268
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's pretty, the interface is pretty.

93
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,429
[SPEAKER_13]: You can choose your color.

94
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Aurora Faint Battle Maneuver

95
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,786
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds a little like Meteos with the whole sideways only movement thing.

96
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:44,787
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll have to give it a try.

97
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:45,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to give it a try.

98
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,949
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually make a character on my phone if you want.

99
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:48,489
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

100
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Or one of these days I'll finally break down and buy an iPhone.

101
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:51,731
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days.

102
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:54,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear people are still lining up for that stuff.

103
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:55,093
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

104
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:56,634
[SPEAKER_13]: But also, I...

105
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I downloaded something else.

106
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:06,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually think that I might, though, try... This was it.

107
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,668
[SPEAKER_13]: I was about to download Ms.

108
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Pac-Man.

109
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:13,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And apparently, it's utter crap, so I didn't do it.

110
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's no real good way to control it.

111
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:19,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I can imagine.

112
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:21,521
[SPEAKER_13]: They should do Marble Madness for iPhone, though.

113
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,383
[SPEAKER_13]: If they can do Monkey Ball, they can do Marble Madness.

114
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:24,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

115
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:26,684
[SPEAKER_13]: But Monkey Ball sucks on iPhone, just letting you know.

116
00:06:26,944 --> 00:06:27,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

117
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

118
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,605
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to play just right.

119
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:40,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of holding your phone at a perfect flat angle, you actually have to tilt it away from you downwards to have it be in the neutral position.

120
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really...

121
00:06:45,046 --> 00:06:46,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Not good.

122
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:56,029
[SPEAKER_13]: I also did play some Ragnarok, but not quite as much as I have been, because I've been doing a lot of homework.

123
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:00,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I did, though, get some fantastic nerd time yesterday.

124
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,931
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't video game related, but a video game was going to come out for it, and they canceled it, and it pissed me off.

125
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched a whole crap ton of Stargate SG-1.

126
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:30,425
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, don't make me smile.

127
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:32,406
[SPEAKER_03]: You made me take your picture in front of the giant Stargate.

128
00:07:33,107 --> 00:07:33,607
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

129
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:34,828
[SPEAKER_13]: That was awesome.

130
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:39,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I love me some Stargate, except I do not like Stargate Atlantis.

131
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:40,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Not very much.

132
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:44,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Before this turns into a nerdy sci-fi talk show, any other games?

133
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:47,117
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

134
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:49,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that there's anything wrong with it.

135
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,220
[SPEAKER_13]: The Game of Life.

136
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know a bigger nerd?

137
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:51,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.

138
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:52,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Travis!

139
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,254
[SPEAKER_03]: You're great!

140
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:13,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnetica I also tried Final Fantasy 4 briefly and

141
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:49,406
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta say that I wish it was just a port of the Super Nintendo version because I don't really care for the new 3D graphics.

142
00:08:49,586 --> 00:08:55,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially when they have all their, like most of the cutscenes are in-game using the in-game engine.

143
00:08:55,452 --> 00:09:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you get really close to some of those characters, man, those textures are really low res.

144
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,440
[SPEAKER_04]: But overall, it's pretty good.

145
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:15,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I played also Korg 10 DS, which isn't really a game, but more of an actual piece of synthesizer software.

146
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:21,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So I played around with that, but since I don't really know how to use a Korg 10, I didn't really make much with it.

147
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,360
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's fun.

148
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,582
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be cool to play around with.

149
00:09:25,363 --> 00:09:26,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the 360...

150
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:29,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Wario Land Shake Wario Land Shake

151
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:55,087
[SPEAKER_04]: A perfect example of how they can do really good 2D platform games now with the technology that's out there.

152
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:56,947
[SPEAKER_04]: All hand-drawn animation.

153
00:09:57,647 --> 00:09:59,148
[SPEAKER_04]: They have anime cutscenes.

154
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:00,788
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

155
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:01,548
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

156
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:11,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And sadly enough, if only Nintendo had actually talked a little bit about this game at E3, they might have actually saved their little press conference.

157
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:13,111
[SPEAKER_04]: But, whatever.

158
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, let's see what else did I play...

159
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:19,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was about it, actually.

160
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,567
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty brief.

161
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:40,747
[SPEAKER_03]: or hell, even 12.

162
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:47,590
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Final Fantasy 4 and so it was very interesting to kind of revisit that world on the DS.

163
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,052
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting because the difficulty, you definitely can sense the change in the difficulty.

164
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:58,414
[SPEAKER_03]: If you kind of grew up on Final Fantasy 2 American like I did, you definitely can feel the change in the difficulty.

165
00:10:58,654 --> 00:11:05,417
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you could kind of breeze right through the Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo and just, you didn't really have to grind or anything like that.

166
00:11:05,477 --> 00:11:07,637
[SPEAKER_03]: You do need to do a little bit, not a lot.

167
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:09,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that gets annoying in role-playing games.

168
00:11:09,298 --> 00:11:10,399
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do a lot of grinding.

169
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:15,143
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do a little bit to kind of make sure that your characters aren't getting completely overpowered by the enemies.

170
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:21,848
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely feel the ramp up in the difficulty of what the enemies are casting on you, the speed of how they're attacking, and all of that.

171
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:26,211
[SPEAKER_03]: You can definitely feel an increased difficulty in the game, and it kind of makes it feel like a whole new experience.

172
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:28,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you have the new translation and everything.

173
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:32,196
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like that they put voice acting in the game.

174
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:32,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of neat.

175
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:37,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it only shows up in a few select scenes, they actually pull it off on the DS pretty well.

176
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:51,911
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not A plus level voice acting but it's not terrible it does add a certain element to the story that I've just loved for so many years my biggest complaint about the game would be the exact same thing as Loki I don't like the graphics I don't like

177
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:54,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The look, very much, of what they've given the game.

178
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:57,855
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like I'm playing an old PlayStation 1 game.

179
00:11:58,055 --> 00:12:00,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels very choppy.

180
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:03,119
[SPEAKER_03]: It feels like even Final Fantasy VII looked better than this.

181
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,924
[SPEAKER_04]: The cutscenes don't have the same style of graphics as the actual game itself.

182
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:14,968
[SPEAKER_04]: The cutscenes make it look all badass and everything is all realistic looking and then all of a sudden it's just cartoony.

183
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:16,850
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like Final Fantasy VII where...

184
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:24,531
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics were kind of cartoony but the cutscenes, the characters were also a bit cartoony as well.

185
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,959
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it doesn't match whatsoever.

186
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:31,461
[SPEAKER_04]: You go with this really super deformed-looking character to ultra-realistic.

187
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:36,084
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is, but I would have almost just preferred redone sprites.

188
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of the Final Fantasy PSP games.

189
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:42,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Those games are beautiful, and they're still sprite-based, but they look amazing.

190
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:47,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the look on those, and that's kind of what I almost wish this had been.

191
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,472
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see GameGuru in chat is saying, just get Final Fantasy IV Advance.

192
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, but that was just basically...

193
00:12:54,013 --> 00:12:55,155
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

194
00:13:11,435 --> 00:13:35,043
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can you actually get to Kaipo the desert town you kind of can play your first you know training your wit game and that's actually one of the summons that will replace Rydia for a certain time and you can teach it battle commands and you actually level it up through these silly little ds games like the math game which I actually thought the math game was kind of fun for a mini game maybe it's just the nerd in me I don't know but I thought there were some nice touches and some nice additions that they did in the game I like the whole map

195
00:13:35,643 --> 00:13:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

196
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,602
[SPEAKER_03]: in the translation from Japan to America such as Rosa's Prey ability, Cecil's Darkness ability.

197
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,484
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are now back in the game and you can add extra abilities to the characters.

198
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:10,647
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I think this game is a little bit superior to just direct port like you had on Advance, maybe with a new translation.

199
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:16,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think I would be more impressed if they just would have put this on a CD-based system, even PS2.

200
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

201
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,601
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

202
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:03,884
[SPEAKER_04]: OLRDS HATERS

203
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:19,662
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not a DS hater.

204
00:15:19,702 --> 00:15:23,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the games that are kind of made for a DS, like Trauma Center.

205
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:23,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Great game.

206
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:25,586
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't play that really anywhere else.

207
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:27,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess you can on the Wii, but that's a whole other story.

208
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:31,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooking Mama is actually kind of fun on the DS.

209
00:15:31,871 --> 00:15:38,756
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lots of these types of games on the DS, even things like Metroid Prime Hunters and stuff that you can't really get on other types of systems.

210
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:46,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like trying to make an old 8-bit Nintendo game work on this new idea of how to control a game.

211
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other thing.

212
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my other big problem with Final Fantasy IV is that it needs an analog stick.

213
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:59,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to control Cecil, which all these years I thought it was Cecil, but according to the voice acting, it's Cecil.

214
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:05,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to control Cecil in that 3D environment where basically everything's rotated at 45 degrees, it sucks.

215
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:12,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Because diagonals on the DS are kind of hard to pull off with that little, you know... I don't know if there were other...

216
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:13,811
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

217
00:16:32,837 --> 00:16:52,278
[SPEAKER_03]: so play a little more at least until you get it so we can kind of check that feature out because I don't know how many people I know are going to get this game although I do recommend it if you're a Final Fantasy fanboy, fangirl it's worth checking out especially if you've never played the game you've never been through the story you must now is the time to experience the Final Fantasy 4 story because it's great

218
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:59,920
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have played the old games, you know, have already kind of made your way through them, I still say it's worth a look.

219
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:06,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper, because it's a $40 DS game, but it's not going to be a waste of your time.

220
00:17:06,862 --> 00:17:08,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, you know, kind of a different experience.

221
00:17:09,283 --> 00:17:10,383
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

222
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:16,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Bobby in chat commented again, he said, confirmed, OLR likes to debunk Black Wolf.

223
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:19,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bobby, you're great.

224
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:28,782
[SPEAKER_03]: GameGuru says, look, every port or remake of a NES and Super NES for the DS means no PlayStation Network or Virtual Console port, and that makes me mad.

225
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:31,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of agree.

226
00:17:31,705 --> 00:17:39,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost think the PSP lends itself better to these types of old 8-bit games being remade, if the Final Fantasy 1 and 2 recreations are any guide, because those were great.

227
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:42,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see Final Fantasy 6 redone.

228
00:17:43,433 --> 00:17:47,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that is like the holy grail of Final Fantasy to a lot of people, but I would like to see...

229
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:50,258
[SPEAKER_03]: A new approach taken to it.

230
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:51,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of don't want it on the DS.

231
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:56,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see it as a remade for at least the PS2 if nothing else.

232
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it a budget title for the PS2 if nothing else.

233
00:17:58,763 --> 00:17:59,884
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be tons of people that want it.

234
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:08,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Also in my gaming week, I mean that was pretty much the majority of it, but I also was playing some more Civilization Revolution, which is a game I think is pretty cool.

235
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,759
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed Bobby Blackwolf was playing Civil Revolution.

236
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:19,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Bobby, he was playing that quite a bit this weekend, so I'm thinking Bobby and I need to have World War 3 at some point on Civilization Revolution.

237
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I'm not that great at the game, he'll probably beat me.

238
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully he sucks too and we can just have fun with it.

239
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:30,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, also I've been playing that new, um, Xbox Live Arcade game that came out.

240
00:18:30,949 --> 00:18:35,032
[SPEAKER_03]: The, uh, um, the street dancing game, whose name I accidentally closed the window at.

241
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,452
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

242
00:18:35,472 --> 00:18:39,235
[SPEAKER_03]: The Go Go Beat... Let me look up.

243
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:40,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Go Beat Steady?

244
00:18:40,776 --> 00:18:41,676
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was the name of it.

245
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:42,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it earlier.

246
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:44,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I played, obviously you can tell I didn't play a whole lot of it.

247
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:46,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Go Go Break Steady, that's the name of it.

248
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I played it for a little bit, and, uh...

249
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like the concept.

250
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:58,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the fact that it kind of starts in this Guitar Room Man style, you know, buttons coming from the outside of the screen to the inside.

251
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:02,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And the better you hit them in rhythm, then you go into a puzzle game like Zuma.

252
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of thought that was cool.

253
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:10,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that the music, you know, the hip-hop and breakdancing music is not really something I get excited about in the video game.

254
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:30,938
[SPEAKER_03]: but I know there are people that do get excited for that so I'm glad there's a decent music video game that kind of incorporates that so I think for that reason alone it's worth checking out but I would like to see that whole kind of puzzle music game fusion applied to other genres and music I think it could be kind of cool so that's it for my gaming week

255
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,570
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura.

256
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:57,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

257
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:19,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

258
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:20,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

259
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:21,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright.

260
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:33,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, being that E3 was not really this week, but last week, there's been a lot of either disappointment or just a lot of opinions about it.

261
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:44,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And a couple publishers, one being Bethesda, has been trying to defend E3, saying that it is still needed, but it needs to change a bit.

262
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

263
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:53,369
[SPEAKER_04]: What they've been saying is before it used to be very bustling, lots of people in there.

264
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,076
[SPEAKER_04]: But now it's just vacant and not that many people come and visit them.

265
00:20:58,136 --> 00:20:59,698
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Bethesda, I mean, they're not...

266
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:13,773
[SPEAKER_04]: A small publisher by any means, but at the same time, I remember when you guys visited Bethesda, their booth wasn't that big, not compared to EA or Microsoft or something like that.

267
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:22,297
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe now that everything's scaled down even more, a lot of people might miss going to visit these smaller publishers that are there.

268
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of sucks.

269
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

270
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:49,469
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura and I were lucky enough to get to go to one of them and sit in the lovely air conditioning for a while and look at the Star Trek game that was coming out.

271
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:50,769
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

272
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:59,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it was one of those games that was awesome in theory, but the execution, unfortunately, by the time the game actually came out, it didn't work out so well.

273
00:21:59,473 --> 00:22:01,393
[SPEAKER_03]: But we got excited about it watching it.

274
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,694
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great in theory.

275
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,694
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually taped the whole thing.

276
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,576
[SPEAKER_03]: How they recreated the Arathacon battle was pretty awesome.

277
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,136
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I know.

278
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:08,796
[SPEAKER_11]: That was sweet.

279
00:22:08,976 --> 00:22:10,297
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, anyhow, sorry.

280
00:22:10,838 --> 00:22:13,340
[SPEAKER_04]: But they just say that it needs to change.

281
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:21,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really offer any suggestions of how it will change or how they want to change it, but I don't know.

282
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:28,011
[SPEAKER_04]: But EA, another company also displeased with the current E3.

283
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:35,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Ironically enough, though, they're saying that it's soulless and that they would want it open to the public now.

284
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,540
[SPEAKER_04]: They wish to invite the community to the show.

285
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,183
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

286
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,981
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

287
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just interesting.

288
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:14,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not stopping from EA.

289
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Now here we go, another person at EA kind of speaking up saying, gosh, we missed the old one when you kind of broke it in the first place.

290
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:24,764
[SPEAKER_03]: But Peter Moore wasn't there when EA got... I don't know.

291
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:25,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way.

292
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of people aren't going to agree with this because they haven't gone to E3 and they want to.

293
00:23:30,866 --> 00:23:32,746
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they should let the public into E3.

294
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as it was, it was so fucking packed before that...

295
00:23:38,154 --> 00:23:46,463
[SPEAKER_04]: you know adding the public on top of that is gonna be nuts you're not gonna get anything done what they need to do is find some happy medium between the old E3 and the new E3

296
00:23:47,392 --> 00:24:13,705
[SPEAKER_04]: so maybe lax up the amount of people that they're allowing to be invited to these things because I know we can't get invited to fucking E3 anymore because it's just too strict but before there was people like Walmart employees that work on their garden section just because Walmart carries video games they got into E3 you know weird shit like that if they can cut down on some of that stuff people that don't actually need to be there then I think it would be a little bit better um

297
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:16,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about adding the public.

298
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:20,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that there's other events that the public can go to if they need to do this kind of stuff.

299
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:34,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Be able to walk up to a booth and play anything because it's going to be fucking mobbed.

300
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:35,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say this.

301
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:36,918
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very interesting, the comments.

302
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:39,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I keep quoting Bobby, but he's giving us good stuff tonight.

303
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:41,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby in our chat room at chat.org.com.

304
00:24:42,223 --> 00:24:43,884
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, Peter Moore loved the community.

305
00:24:44,205 --> 00:24:48,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft did a lot more for the enthusiast press last year when Peter Moore was in charge.

306
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:50,530
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, they didn't really care about us as much.

307
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:56,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of interesting because Microsoft has always kind of had that very – they're kind of seen amongst the big three, especially as being the ones that are –

308
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:59,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Way more out there with the community and everything.

309
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:02,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, heck, you can get an OLR gamer pick on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

310
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: That's saying something right there.

311
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: If our crappy little show has representation somehow in the Microsoft world, you know what I mean?

312
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,449
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of speaks to what Microsoft's doing for the community.

313
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of interesting.

314
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:21,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like I said, I just remember when there was like 75,000 people there and how... Okay, let's...

315
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,859
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

316
00:25:46,724 --> 00:25:50,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't imagine another 20,000 people there just to see this madness.

317
00:25:51,367 --> 00:26:03,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I think what they just have to do to fix it is don't make it invite only, but make it kind of where only folks with business licenses and official type blogs and things like that can get in.

318
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:10,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will really open it up to the independent press to get in there and gamers who are really enthusiastic about gaming, namely us.

319
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,421
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does keep out the Walmart Garden Center employees.

320
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:15,561
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

321
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody does.

322
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not invite retail?

323
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:44,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of getting what you need out of it because I know some of these years it's hard to see everything.

324
00:26:45,014 --> 00:26:54,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the way that they do these press conferences definitely helps because in that way you can see everything and then you can decide what you need to go see further.

325
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:55,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

326
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:57,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that a lot because that works for the gamers days.

327
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Digest all the information.

328
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:05,183
[SPEAKER_04]: The publishers can make sure that the people that they have the information that they want out there

329
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:23,942
[SPEAKER_04]: and if they want to further show it off maybe not necessarily do a game demonstration during the middle of the show because I think that's kind of retarded sometimes but hey, this game is playable at our booth, go check it out or hey, let's set up some times to come visit the booth and play the game

330
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:26,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well let's move on.

331
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:42,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about more E3 kind of fallout, because obviously, you know, I know it's been a couple weeks now since E3, but it is one of the highlights in the gaming year, and of course Nintendo got a lot of flack for their E3 press conference, and what's kind of interesting is that Nintendo has essentially kind of...

332
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you want to say they apologized, but they have definitely taken notice at their unpopular reception.

333
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:52,917
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, Satoru Iwata has made some comments on it this week.

334
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:53,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote,

335
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:11,030
[SPEAKER_03]: An interesting apology of sorts.

336
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:19,276
[SPEAKER_03]: But could it just be that folks are just more upset that it seems like these Kid Icarus rumors and other things just weren't to be true?

337
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:20,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

338
00:28:20,457 --> 00:28:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least now.

339
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just upsetting because all they showed was games for casual people.

340
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no.

341
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:26,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate...

342
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:33,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Distinguishing games between casuals and the core gamers or whatever because that's the big trendy thing to say nowadays.

343
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:39,205
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, Wii Music is like an over-glorified toy.

344
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:40,946
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no depth to it whatsoever.

345
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:42,127
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just crap.

346
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:46,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But, Loki, you got a logo for Grand Theft Auto Chitotown Wars.

347
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that is a hardcore game.

348
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:48,832
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, that's the thing.

349
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,133
[SPEAKER_03]: The logo, Loki...

350
00:28:50,473 --> 00:28:54,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, but that's one thing that got me excited about it.

351
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:58,182
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't actually have to show anything, just say, hey, we're working on this.

352
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:02,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at a couple years ago, they were showing off a video for Mario Kart Wii.

353
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,169
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't come out for two years after that.

354
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

355
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,937
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a really early teaser video for it a few years prior to that, and everyone got hyped.

356
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at what the other companies are doing when Microsoft teases Halo 3.

357
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,724
[SPEAKER_03]: All they have to do is say, you know, that first trailer did not have a lot to do with the final product.

358
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:21,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great, though.

359
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It was epic in the making.

360
00:29:23,487 --> 00:29:31,073
[SPEAKER_03]: It showed nothing in the actual in-game footage, but it was epic and theatrical, and it got everybody pumped about Halo 3, even though it didn't come out for a while.

361
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:37,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony, God of War 3, you know that shit ain't coming out for a long time, but they just had to say the name.

362
00:29:37,658 --> 00:29:48,143
[SPEAKER_04]: here's my thing is I think and I honestly when you see that one chick I don't remember her name the new one that replaced Perrin Kaplan or whatever that's doing her stupid snowboarding shit on

363
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:52,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't honestly believe that she actually plays any games.

364
00:29:52,657 --> 00:30:00,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I honestly... She may play the DS and play the fucking Brain Age shit, and she may be one of those casual gamers, but I can't see her as an actual gamer.

365
00:30:00,703 --> 00:30:07,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the problem, though, is because they don't play these games, and they don't necessarily have to play a lot of games to be able to... Yeah, that's not their job, though.

366
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:08,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Their job isn't to make the games.

367
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:14,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It isn't to make the games, but they should be familiar with the product and know how to hype it up for their audience.

368
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:15,712
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they should do, because...

369
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:17,754
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

370
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:35,329
[SPEAKER_04]: But they didn't have to do that much.

371
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they just said, oh, Pokemon.

372
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is coming out.

373
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,651
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have showed a trailer for that.

374
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,892
[SPEAKER_04]: They could have shown Wario Land Shake.

375
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:49,896
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a perfect example of a game that can be for the core gamer and also for more of a casual player.

376
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:54,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask DarkSakura, because she's been awfully quiet through this, but I'm just kind of curious of your opinion, DarkSakura.

377
00:30:54,878 --> 00:31:01,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Nintendo really make a misstep with this E3, or are we at fault for letting our expectations be too high in the first place?

378
00:31:04,335 --> 00:31:07,658
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be perfectly honest that I'm very neutral toward the whole thing.

379
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:16,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because they obviously addressed the things that they felt they needed to address to increase their market.

380
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:19,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that's the whole big thing with businesses.

381
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,209
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to increase your market share.

382
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:28,755
[SPEAKER_13]: They know if they release a Zelda or a Mario or whatever that they're going to get their core market.

383
00:31:30,396 --> 00:31:31,157
[SPEAKER_13]: We're already loyal.

384
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:32,598
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be preaching to the choir.

385
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:55,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I think where it comes in is that if they're trying to convince and I'm trying to think of the best way to phrase this if they're trying to convince this new market that they're trying to bring in this expanded market that doing it in a media centered event where it's going to go out in press you know I think that

386
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:57,286
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com.

387
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:27,576
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they pretty much realize that we already know they're working on something.

388
00:32:27,596 --> 00:32:36,880
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't have to go and make some sort of claim that, you know, oh, we're doing this when they know we want to keep these gamers, we're going to put out this game.

389
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,362
[SPEAKER_13]: That goes without saying, there's absolutely no reason for them to make an announcement until they have something concrete to give us.

390
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:43,202
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

391
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:47,566
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife knows that I love her, but she likes to hear it every now and again.

392
00:32:47,726 --> 00:32:50,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is exactly why we have to do this.

393
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,591
[SPEAKER_04]: We may assume that they're doing this stuff, but you know what?

394
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,994
[SPEAKER_04]: If we don't see it enough, we may not assume it anymore.

395
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:00,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're thinking Nintendo doesn't love you anymore, Loki?

396
00:33:00,356 --> 00:33:00,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what it is?

397
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:02,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I think that exactly.

398
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:03,358
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to be cuddled.

399
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:10,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we have no more Sega systems, yet we keep getting Sonic games.

400
00:33:10,803 --> 00:33:12,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Sega knows where their bread and butter is coming from.

401
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:18,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo hasn't succeeded this long.

402
00:33:18,388 --> 00:33:23,972
[SPEAKER_13]: They're obviously not run by a bunch of crayon-eating, chain-to-the-jungle-gem morons.

403
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:26,913
[SPEAKER_13]: No mention name of people.

404
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:27,934
[SPEAKER_13]: But...

405
00:33:29,455 --> 00:33:58,499
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that when it and they do have they're given a certain amount of time that they can have their press conference and they have parameters they have to keep in mind I think that they were trying to reach a certain market and then once they got that message out they know that there's other means that they can get the word out to the core gamer that we're going to be a bit more curious we're going to look for these things rather than you take the stuff to the mass market

406
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:01,200
[SPEAKER_13]: But your core is going to come to you every time.

407
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:17,824
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, I want to see if this actually works out for them because the problem with their core audience that they're targeting right now, the mom and pops that bought the Wii system to play Wii Sports, now they're anticipating, okay, well, they're going to buy this Wii Sports resort thing.

408
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:22,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that's true because if it's not, they're going to end up with another fucking...

409
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:24,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

410
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:49,287
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, my thing, and I think it's kind of like, you know, if a Zelda game is in development, you know, yes, we all know it's in development, but kind of throw us a freaking bone.

411
00:34:49,527 --> 00:35:02,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for instance, if we know that in the new Zelda game, Link is going to ride a gigantic spider, then, like, show us the image of Link riding a giant spider and, you know, put out there, Link and his giant spider friend coming next fall.

412
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:07,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, give us something to, and then all the Nintendo fanboys can run around with their giant boners and go...

413
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, did you see the giant spider?

414
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:12,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that's all they had to do.

415
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at Mario Kart.

416
00:35:13,183 --> 00:35:14,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, this is a perfect example.

417
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:15,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart.

418
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:19,746
[SPEAKER_04]: They showed a CG trailer that showed Mario in a kart, racing around.

419
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:20,586
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

420
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:24,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing from the game, no graphics whatsoever.

421
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:28,330
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a CG trailer to get people hyped up that, oh my god, Mario Kart's coming.

422
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:33,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like we didn't see Mario Kart coming, because it's been on almost every single Nintendo system.

423
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

424
00:35:35,254 --> 00:35:38,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, that got people excited and gave them something to anticipate.

425
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:47,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Another Mario game, for all I know, it could be a crappy, and you know this is gonna come anyways, like Mario Tennis or Mario Golf.

426
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:50,408
[SPEAKER_04]: But once again, that's not a hardcore game.

427
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:55,853
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a game targeting those same people that bought fucking Wii to play Wii Sports.

428
00:35:56,033 --> 00:35:58,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop catering to people that play Wii Sports!

429
00:35:58,476 --> 00:35:59,437
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other games out there.

430
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:00,778
[SPEAKER_09]: They sold their systems, didn't they?

431
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:02,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.

432
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:02,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

433
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,120
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not be selling the way it is if it weren't for Wii Sports.

434
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a Wii Sports sequel was an inevitability.

435
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:08,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one little thing.

436
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:09,783
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where it comes down to.

437
00:36:10,523 --> 00:36:11,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Bottom line.

438
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:11,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Money.

439
00:36:12,684 --> 00:36:22,789
[SPEAKER_13]: What company is out there... If they were out there to, I guess, be nice and sweet and cuddly, they'd be a not-for-profit organization.

440
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,692
[SPEAKER_13]: As it is, they have to make money.

441
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:34,735
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the nice way for Nintendo to tell the teenagers of America your mom has more money than you do?

442
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:44,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we've done selective targeting for certain products, and we feel that the adult demographic would be... Okay, go ahead.

443
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say this, though.

444
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran in chat is great.

445
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,721
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a title for my new Zelda game.

446
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:51,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Legend of Zelda Web of Lies.

447
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:53,003
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

448
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:57,205
[SPEAKER_13]: What I was trying to say before is that they probably see something, oh, well...

449
00:36:58,143 --> 00:37:01,425
[SPEAKER_13]: To expand our market, we're going to appeal to a different demographic.

450
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:05,327
[SPEAKER_13]: We're aiming towards the older people who might have been our core group at a younger age.

451
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:09,949
[SPEAKER_13]: We're trying to reclaim the market that is now, quote, grown out of video games.

452
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go get a job.

453
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, why do you think that I was in technical writing for a while?

454
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice.

455
00:37:16,553 --> 00:37:17,994
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, final thought, then we got to move on.

456
00:37:18,014 --> 00:37:18,414
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought.

457
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:20,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's like this.

458
00:37:21,267 --> 00:37:23,549
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good idea for them to try to expand their market.

459
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:29,393
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, though, is bringing these people into the gaming market isn't going to necessarily do a lot of good for you.

460
00:37:29,813 --> 00:37:48,265
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is, you've got to get people confident in your platform because come five years from now when you're releasing your next Nintendo system and Microsoft's releasing their next Xbox system and the PlayStation with the PlayStation 4, you're not going to have a lot of people wanting to buy your next system

461
00:37:49,588 --> 00:37:50,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

462
00:38:07,338 --> 00:38:08,719
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's where you're going to end up hurting.

463
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:09,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's down later on.

464
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:21,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't often get a chance to acknowledge the JustinTVers because there's so many chat rooms for us to read but I just took a peek in there and one thing I thought that was pretty funny that they're talking about in there some folks are saying Pokemon MMO is what's needed.

465
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it hasn't already happened.

466
00:38:38,103 --> 00:38:51,235
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, for an example, actually, a lot of custom servers for Ragnarok Online have a Pokeball system where you can actually capture your different creatures as your pets, and then once they become loyal, they help you fight.

467
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:55,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it would be that much harder to do something centered around going out and actually, you know...

468
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,980
[SPEAKER_13]: If they can do it on a regular video game, why can't they have it in a multiplayer format?

469
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,661
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you have, for example, you have your arena system.

470
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:06,962
[SPEAKER_13]: You can actually have your gyms be set up that way.

471
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:11,444
[SPEAKER_13]: And you've got whoever has the best group or whatever.

472
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:14,825
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have a continuously rotating list.

473
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:17,186
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe your gym leader is one of the GMs or something.

474
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's move on.

475
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:21,207
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's very, very possible.

476
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:22,927
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we have more Nintendo news.

477
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:24,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, stuff about Reggie.

478
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:24,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

479
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:30,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Reggie is like, okay, we know, pretty much.

480
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:42,347
[SPEAKER_13]: He said, from an America-centric perspective, to quote, that Wii's storage capacity is a big problem over here because we like WiiWare and Virtual Console.

481
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And he told MTV that there is an urgency to find a storage solution.

482
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,991
[SPEAKER_13]: So he says that Nintendo is working on something.

483
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:54,073
[SPEAKER_13]: They are not ready to tell us what they are working on, but they are working on something.

484
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:54,974
[SPEAKER_13]: But...

485
00:39:57,921 --> 00:40:19,125
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually think that they're going to... And while it wouldn't be hard to do something USB-based, knowing Nintendo, they're going to try to do something proprietary, something that can't be mimicked, something that no one's going to be able... Well, in theory, no one's going to be able to break and just, you know, hack their own like we used to do on the old PlayStation hard drives, remember?

486
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:20,548
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

487
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:48,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee you it won't be proprietary and I guarantee you it'll be something really simple that could be done right now, but they're gonna drag their fucking feet until it gets done.

488
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:51,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be some stupid USB hard drive thing.

489
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:54,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Just open up USB to use storage devices.

490
00:40:54,804 --> 00:40:56,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Your problem's solved right there.

491
00:40:56,526 --> 00:41:01,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It only takes one firmware update and you're no longer, I mean, it's no different than it is now.

492
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

493
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's the money for them to make from that?

494
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:05,931
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to make money off everything.

495
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:14,233
[SPEAKER_03]: On the official Nintendo USB drives that they'll release in stores along with that for $10 more than the generic brands will cost.

496
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:16,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I still think they're going to have some way to system lock it.

497
00:41:16,953 --> 00:41:27,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Even if they do it via USB, they're going to have some sort of code that you have to read off of the storage device so that it recognizes it as Nintendo only.

498
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:29,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're nervous about people using the USB thing to hack the system.

499
00:41:30,259 --> 00:41:32,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously think that's the case.

500
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,983
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why they're going to try to protect their investment.

501
00:41:35,904 --> 00:41:43,110
[SPEAKER_13]: From a business perspective, they're not going to want to leave it open for anyone else to profit off of or to take money out of their pocket.

502
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:49,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Or let's think of how retarded it was in the first place that they only put half a gig of storage space on their stupid system.

503
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:49,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they were...

504
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:50,956
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

505
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:16,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo is the pro at aftermarket upgrades.

506
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, think about it.

507
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:21,939
[SPEAKER_13]: This is my prediction.

508
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,906
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to get a hard drive unit of some variety that is going to fit in with the Wii.

509
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:31,430
[SPEAKER_13]: It's either going to run off of USB or have some sort of

510
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:39,416
[SPEAKER_13]: So either way, there's going to be some sort of lockout on it so that you can only use the Nintendo storage whatever with the Wii.

511
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:45,340
[SPEAKER_13]: And then as it progresses, we're going to get like the Wii Deluxe or something.

512
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:57,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe the new upgrade, they drop the price of the old Wii, bring out the new Wii at the regular price, the storage becomes even more cheap as the time goes by, and we're going to get a new Nintendo.

513
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:57,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

514
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:01,752
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's why I don't understand they can't do that now, because the price of flash storage has gone down so much.

515
00:43:02,052 --> 00:43:07,136
[SPEAKER_04]: They could just say, okay, going forward now, all the Wii's that we put out are going to have 4 gigs of storage instead.

516
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:09,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it'll piss off a lot of people, but you know what?

517
00:43:09,938 --> 00:43:10,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough.

518
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:12,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

519
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:20,885
[SPEAKER_03]: At least Reggie admits the problem is out there, even if he used a very politically correct kind of term to do that.

520
00:43:21,226 --> 00:43:23,167
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole American-centric perspective.

521
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:25,989
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they're finally admitting there's a problem.

522
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:30,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I think that he's probably looking at where the majority of the complaint has come from.

523
00:43:31,457 --> 00:43:36,240
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is, at least as far as I've seen too, has been mostly the American market.

524
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,243
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think he's saying, well, at least Nintendo of America loves you.

525
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It's our cuddle, Rob.

526
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:43,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

527
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that was our cuddle.

528
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:45,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

529
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:46,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

530
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:49,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Smack him in the fucking face.

531
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

532
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:51,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

533
00:43:51,113 --> 00:43:52,474
[SPEAKER_04]: We acknowledge there's a problem now.

534
00:43:52,614 --> 00:43:54,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm glad you finally jumped on board with that.

535
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:55,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki needs a little love.

536
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:59,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Would he be so angry if somebody would just... Oh, I can't wait to interview some of these people.

537
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that would be awesome.

538
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:06,522
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that Loki needs something that starts with a D and ends with an E. And it's two words.

539
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:07,763
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's called duct tape.

540
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, my only wish is that you take your little media badge at this event that says Orange Lounge Radio and you put a sticker over it that says Bobby Blackwolf Show before you go and interview these people.

541
00:44:22,918 --> 00:44:23,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take it a step further.

542
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:24,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll put my name as Bobby Blackpool.

543
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:30,941
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just going to have someone follow around and once you hit that just borderline breaking point, we'll be like, okay, interview's over.

544
00:44:31,221 --> 00:44:31,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Next.

545
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:32,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

546
00:44:33,482 --> 00:44:34,963
[SPEAKER_13]: So, speaking of next, Rob.

547
00:44:35,103 --> 00:44:41,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You would love it if I just put on a mask and dress up like Captain Anger or something like that.

548
00:44:41,365 --> 00:44:42,786
[SPEAKER_13]: You could be Mr. Furious.

549
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

550
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:57,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, because of a certain patent lawsuit that Nintendo is facing, that certain Nintendo peripherals are actually going to be or could be pulled from market.

551
00:44:57,683 --> 00:45:01,924
[SPEAKER_04]: These would include any Nintendo controller that has dual analog sticks.

552
00:45:02,424 --> 00:45:10,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So, any of your classic controllers, your GameCube controllers, those are going to be taken from the market.

553
00:45:11,387 --> 00:45:11,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

554
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:18,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the Wii Remote and Nunchuck are okay because those only have one analog stick.

555
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:33,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is all because of that wonderful $21 million patent infringement verdict that was brought up on the company because of the patent holder and Escape that has sued them.

556
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,811
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's time for Nintendo to pay their money.

557
00:45:38,212 --> 00:45:39,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Or licensing rights.

558
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's actually going to happen?

559
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:43,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

560
00:45:43,421 --> 00:45:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, well, I mean, they have to pay them because it's, you know, the verdict has been placed.

561
00:45:51,186 --> 00:45:52,287
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, though, there's... Appeals.

562
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:53,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Second level appeals.

563
00:45:53,748 --> 00:45:54,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Supreme Court appeal.

564
00:45:55,629 --> 00:46:01,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Anscape is basically saying that Nintendo has clogged the channel and they're looking to make...

565
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:06,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't honestly think that they're going to try to make controllers.

566
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:07,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they just want money.

567
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:08,198
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have kind of done it by now.

568
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:14,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord Katsuhito says Nintendo will settle out of court in chat.orangehunter.com Probably.

569
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:15,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely.

570
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:17,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually the way these things go.

571
00:46:18,715 --> 00:46:26,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, Nintendo is going to be debuting the Wii Bonus Content feature very soon over in Japan.

572
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:34,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a new little feature that they put in a 16-digit code into this bonus thing, and you get a new...

573
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:35,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Present, so to speak.

574
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:40,974
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii Speaker Channel is the first thing that's supposed to be using this.

575
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:50,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming with that game on the Nintendo DS, I think we talked about it a few weeks ago, that is kind of like using the speakers so you can do the audio translation of channels or whatever.

576
00:46:51,577 --> 00:46:51,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

577
00:46:52,237 --> 00:46:56,818
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also further speculation going on that possibly these codes could be used for...

578
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:04,082
[SPEAKER_03]: WePoint, free download games, virtual console, sell virtual console games in stores.

579
00:47:04,462 --> 00:47:07,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like what Xbox Live does with their own redemption system.

580
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:12,627
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy Uno or Texas Hold'em in a store on a card and give it as a gift.

581
00:47:13,988 --> 00:47:15,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that's what this is for.

582
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:17,671
[SPEAKER_03]: If it even comes out here.

583
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:22,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and I think the only thing this is, it's to deter piracy.

584
00:47:23,556 --> 00:47:28,041
[SPEAKER_04]: because then you get some bonus with it and you can only get that if you buy the game legitimately.

585
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:37,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Ironically enough, though, all those bonus things that they're talking about, like the Wii Speaker Channel, link to the internet anyway, so it's not gonna matter.

586
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:46,703
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there is something that I think is going to be very, very, very cool to come out.

587
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:47,523
[SPEAKER_13]: At least in Japan.

588
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:48,965
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we're going to get it here.

589
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:54,710
[SPEAKER_13]: But when I first looked at it, I thought it was like the Purika, the print club stuff.

590
00:47:55,451 --> 00:47:56,632
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's actually not quite.

591
00:47:56,712 --> 00:48:01,276
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the Digicam Print Channel that's going to be on the Wii.

592
00:48:01,376 --> 00:48:03,518
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually a collaboration with Fujifilm.

593
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:04,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Where...

594
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:21,310
[SPEAKER_13]: You upload your digital pictures by using the SD slot and you can actually get them printed out and sent to you through Fujifilm and they give you a photo book that's 1,575 yen or you can get a Mario one that's 2480 yen.

595
00:48:27,753 --> 00:48:54,268
[SPEAKER_13]: and you can actually even have them printed out to well you can have your Meishi printed out which is a Japanese business card it's like your name card basically the thing is that when you introduce yourself to somebody you give them your card with your name on it but you can have your Meishi with your Wii on it not your Wii but your Mii on it for 500 yen for 30 cards so it's actually pretty cool I wish we could get something like this

596
00:48:54,488 --> 00:48:58,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it put my 99 digit friend code for every game I have on those cards too?

597
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see why not.

598
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:02,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I would think so.

599
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:07,252
[SPEAKER_13]: That actually would be a very smart idea to have your friend code be on there.

600
00:49:07,272 --> 00:49:08,953
[SPEAKER_03]: See, both you and I need to be working at Nintendo.

601
00:49:09,153 --> 00:49:11,374
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'll tell you what... In the good idea department.

602
00:49:11,554 --> 00:49:18,156
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to link this in the chat room because the article I read the video is down, but the promotional trailer for it is on YouTube.

603
00:49:18,996 --> 00:49:19,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm looking at it.

604
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:22,017
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually pretty cool.

605
00:49:22,037 --> 00:49:22,798
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually a...

606
00:49:23,918 --> 00:49:26,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuji Films demo showing how it works.

607
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:33,966
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really such a neat idea because you can have them printed out in different sizes and shapes and have messages on them.

608
00:49:34,026 --> 00:49:35,066
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually very cool.

609
00:49:35,447 --> 00:49:37,368
[SPEAKER_13]: And also send them to people.

610
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:39,430
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems pretty cool what I'm seeing on this.

611
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:40,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's something that would work here?

612
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this better for Japan's culture?

613
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:54,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's more surrounded around, I would say, how Japanese culture works, but I think that it could be marketable here if they do it right.

614
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

615
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:59,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if the channel already exists, it's just translation.

616
00:50:00,023 --> 00:50:06,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And on Fujifilm's end, or whatever company they partnered with in America, just a matter of a process.

617
00:50:06,789 --> 00:50:07,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Fujifilm's got a big presence in America.

618
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:08,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, Fujifilm's here.

619
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,851
[SPEAKER_03]: So why not?

620
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:10,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Snapfish.

621
00:50:10,431 --> 00:50:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they have a presence of getting the... Are they behind Snapfish?

622
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:15,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

623
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:17,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just mentioning Snapfish.

624
00:50:18,217 --> 00:50:23,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Every photo company has had to evolve to maintain competition with digital photography.

625
00:50:23,942 --> 00:50:25,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure they have something set up.

626
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:45,015
[SPEAKER_13]: The way that I see this is that if rock bands are going through rock band to have their musical presence fortified in the industry when everything is digital download and all that, then why can't the photo companies make use of this?

627
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a good idea.

628
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:53,545
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru in chat says, Damn, sooner or later they will fill the Wii with just channels.

629
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:57,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of a good point because the Wii only has four screens worth of channels.

630
00:50:57,428 --> 00:50:58,509
[SPEAKER_13]: I want the channel channel.

631
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:00,331
[SPEAKER_13]: The channel channel?

632
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:01,412
[SPEAKER_03]: The changed channel channel?

633
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:19,949
[SPEAKER_04]: No, unfortunately they're not going to be able to fill it full of channels because there's not a space on the storage to store all those channels.

634
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

635
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:25,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha Cananograms in chat says this needs to come to America ASAP.

636
00:51:26,554 --> 00:51:29,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fan of the whole Fujifilm channel idea.

637
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:30,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

638
00:51:30,578 --> 00:51:30,978
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see.

639
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:35,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this isn't for the Wii but it uses the Wii remotes.

640
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a brand new homebrew game made called Dark Room Sex Game and what this basically is

641
00:51:43,088 --> 00:52:07,128
[SPEAKER_04]: is two people will take the Wii remotes and they will kind of make a kind of like a hammer motion with it basically shaking the remote in time with the pornographic sounds there's no images it's just all audio that you hear on the screen and you're supposed to do it in rhythm and then eventually kind of speed up to a finish this sounds like a minigame in Mario Party 8

642
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:13,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had brought my Bluetooth adapter.

643
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, though, we can maybe do this on the show.

644
00:52:16,196 --> 00:52:19,639
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for that extra... It's all audio anyways.

645
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:20,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be awesome.

646
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:21,801
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

647
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:24,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Gold Banjo pretty much sums up my thoughts in chat.

648
00:52:24,364 --> 00:52:25,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Weirdest homebrew ever.

649
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:30,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is for the PC, and it is available to download out there, I believe.

650
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:30,831
[SPEAKER_04]: They have...

651
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:50,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the website, itu.dk slash stud slash darkroom And GameGuru in chat says the kind of obvious comment here Why not, you know, have sex?

652
00:52:51,641 --> 00:52:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is safer, you can't contract babies or AIDS Oh, okay, I see

653
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:01,119
[SPEAKER_03]: AIDS and Baby Free, I get it.

654
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:04,360
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, I guess, the positives of playing this game.

655
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're using those remotes with those other attachments that they had, in which case you could probably, yeah.

656
00:53:10,741 --> 00:53:12,422
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to get genital herpes.

657
00:53:13,362 --> 00:53:14,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Herpes maybe.

658
00:53:14,282 --> 00:53:16,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the proper attachments.

659
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:22,985
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, please, let's change the topic real quick here and talk about Castlevania.

660
00:53:24,258 --> 00:53:24,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

661
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:47,234
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

662
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another button where your thumb is.

663
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:27,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently, and that thumb button is used for items later in the game, you stand in a designated spot, you aim your controller to kind of calibrate the game.

664
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:29,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's using like kind of those mocap things.

665
00:54:30,138 --> 00:54:38,661
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're in this outside area and then skeletons start coming out and they'll start shooting arrows at you and you can swing your whip or throw knives at them.

666
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of neat.

667
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:44,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course the weapons like knives, they do take hearts just like the game.

668
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:45,103
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like 25 hearts.

669
00:54:45,123 --> 00:54:48,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like a shooting game with a Castlevania twist on it.

670
00:54:48,424 --> 00:54:50,364
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like this will be coming to the Wii.

671
00:54:50,944 --> 00:54:51,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

672
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:54,405
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rumors that the Silent Hill arcade game is going to come to the Wii.

673
00:54:54,885 --> 00:54:55,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumors.

674
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:58,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that there's more than one way to do it too.

675
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,487
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't necessarily have to be Wii only.

676
00:55:01,363 --> 00:55:02,644
[SPEAKER_03]: This sounds neat in theory, though.

677
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:03,164
[SPEAKER_13]: It does.

678
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:04,045
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty cool.

679
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:09,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Silent Hill, I forgot to mention this during my gaming week, but the Silent Hill movie is right now.

680
00:55:09,268 --> 00:55:10,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Comcast is nationwide.

681
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:18,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if their On Demand thing is nationwide, but Silent Hill is right now in the On Demand and HD for free on Comcast On Demand.

682
00:55:18,354 --> 00:55:21,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually watched it this weekend with William.

683
00:55:21,757 --> 00:55:24,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he'd seen it once in a theater, but he said he didn't understand it at all.

684
00:55:24,518 --> 00:55:25,699
[SPEAKER_03]: He needed me to explain it to him.

685
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So we watched it, and I did.

686
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:27,981
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you what.

687
00:55:28,041 --> 00:55:30,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill and HD, very, very hot.

688
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:33,646
[SPEAKER_03]: is a very good looking movie.

689
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I still like Silent Hill as a movie and I hope the rumors of the sequel are true.

690
00:55:38,674 --> 00:55:38,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so too.

691
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:43,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about some release dates, Rob?

692
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:44,955
[SPEAKER_03]: How about it?

693
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:55,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, for the 30th in the UK, we have Double D Dodgeball on Xbox 360 and Geometry Wars Retro Evolved 2 on Xbox 360.

694
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:59,063
[SPEAKER_13]: On the first, though, is a whole crap ton of stuff.

01:00:36,764 --> 01:00:38,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a PC Engine Best Collection.

762
01:00:38,425 --> 01:00:40,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's three PC Engine games.

763
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:42,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what games they are.

764
01:00:42,846 --> 01:00:43,546
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks familiar.

765
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:44,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know what that is.

766
01:00:44,627 --> 01:00:44,887
[SPEAKER_03]: They're...

767
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:47,478
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks so familiar.

768
01:00:47,658 --> 01:00:48,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks very familiar.

769
01:00:48,618 --> 01:00:51,940
[SPEAKER_13]: There's something, I don't know if it's come out or coming out, though, that I want from overseas.

770
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:52,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, what's that?

771
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:57,183
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the Fantasy Zone collection.

772
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:58,423
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we've covered it before.

773
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:01,425
[SPEAKER_03]: They're shooters, just so you know.

774
01:01:01,445 --> 01:01:01,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

775
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:02,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really familiar.

776
01:01:03,066 --> 01:01:04,186
[SPEAKER_13]: I probably have a couple of them.

777
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:07,108
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, there you have it, your Japanese release dates.

778
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:08,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Busy week, especially on the handhelds in Japan.

779
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:23,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, speaking of other busy events, is that there has been a little, I guess, controversy regarding a lack of Halo information, from what I understand, at E3.

780
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:54,039
[SPEAKER_13]: but they actually were saying that Halo is so big that it would probably need its own event or to quote, big enough at this point that it can stand on its own so there are a few hints going around they've mentioned Comic Con and other conventions that there might be a HaloCon in fact, let me see if I can't get this name

781
01:01:55,925 --> 01:02:24,354
[SPEAKER_13]: just we need another damn convention more plane tickets to buy well but it was I guess one of the higher ups saying that you can do a HaloCon nothing on the scale of Comic Con but you could bring a few hundred people to see a Halo thing if there were a Microsoft and Bungie endorsed Halo tournament Uber thing I bet people would come it depends where they have it Rob, I'd go

782
01:02:25,598 --> 01:02:27,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it would depend on where they'd have it.

783
01:02:27,699 --> 01:02:27,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd go.

784
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,319
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

785
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:31,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't buy another plane ticket to Seattle to go do it.

786
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they did in San Francisco, I'd drive.

787
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:33,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even L.A.

788
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:34,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Heck yeah.

789
01:02:34,822 --> 01:02:35,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

790
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:38,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, HaloCon, possibly coming soon.

791
01:02:39,224 --> 01:02:41,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I see they kidnapped the press to bring them to that.

792
01:02:41,464 --> 01:02:43,485
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, scare the crap out of them.

793
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:43,865
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fun.

794
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:44,986
[SPEAKER_13]: I want someone to cosplay Master Chief.

795
01:02:46,158 --> 01:02:49,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd think there'd be Master Chief cosplay at HaloCon, I would hope.

796
01:02:49,661 --> 01:02:51,442
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cortana and all your favorite Halo characters.

797
01:02:51,462 --> 01:02:56,947
[SPEAKER_04]: And people dress up like Star Wars characters because there's always the Star Wars cosplayers no matter what the convention is.

798
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:58,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why.

799
01:02:59,577 --> 01:03:00,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

800
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:19,978
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

801
01:03:43,416 --> 01:03:45,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I heard another interesting rumor.

802
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:46,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Three is awesome.

803
01:03:47,238 --> 01:03:48,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're thinking the same thing I am.

804
01:03:48,419 --> 01:03:48,899
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you hear?

805
01:03:49,420 --> 01:04:00,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard the rumor that the games that are cross-platform enabled, like Shadowrun and... I want to say there was another one, Lost Planet.

806
01:04:01,887 --> 01:04:07,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, if you have an Xbox 360 version of, you can play those multiplayer on a silver account now.

807
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:10,612
[SPEAKER_04]: And that may lead the way to more...

808
01:04:13,377 --> 01:04:13,777
[SPEAKER_03]: things.

809
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly a foot in the door to a free online play on Xbox.

810
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:18,219
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be very interesting.

811
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:20,100
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

812
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because it's probably just competition from things like Steam and other products that exist, you know, out there.

813
01:04:24,881 --> 01:04:29,483
[SPEAKER_03]: All these kind of competing portals for games on PC, so to speak.

814
01:04:30,323 --> 01:04:32,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Lost Planet Colonies, by the way, that's multi-platform.

815
01:04:32,944 --> 01:04:34,185
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Actdeft in chat.

816
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:39,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I like free, so that's pretty cool, except I don't really play Halo on the computer.

817
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:46,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing, the silver accounts on Xbox Live were able to play some of the games that were kind of impacted by this a little bit.

818
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:49,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Mega Man 9 Box Art T-Shirts

819
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:41,923
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is the same classic cheesy box art with Mega Man having the human head and everything like the Mega Man 2 box art it's like someone at Capcom got the joke in other words well they're actually releasing those as actual t-shirts according to a Capcom official blog Capcom's marketing team in the US is super stoked that everyone is getting what we're doing with the box art including the Japanese development team and I promise you that we'll have some t-shirts of this beauty available for purchase soon

820
01:05:42,663 --> 01:05:43,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

821
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see the other one that they put out?

822
01:05:45,105 --> 01:05:49,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't them, but it was some other... Meatbun.com, I think was what it was.

823
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:54,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the 1942 pin-up girl thing with Cammy.

824
01:05:55,294 --> 01:05:55,794
[SPEAKER_04]: That shirt?

825
01:05:56,114 --> 01:05:56,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I saw that.

826
01:05:57,015 --> 01:05:57,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as funny.

827
01:05:58,076 --> 01:05:58,736
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered one.

828
01:05:59,737 --> 01:06:00,078
[SPEAKER_03]: You would.

829
01:06:00,538 --> 01:06:02,440
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the other game I played on Xbox Live this week.

830
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even talk about it.

831
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:03,981
1942.

832
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's how you remake a retro game for Xbox Live.

833
01:06:07,744 --> 01:06:08,465
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

834
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:15,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I only played the demo, but I was much more impressed with that than any other classic 80s game port I have in a long time.

835
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than maybe Pac-Man Championship Edition.

836
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:23,378
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just check that out if you've been overlooking it because you're burned out on retro arcade releases.

837
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:26,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Because 1942 was pretty awesome, I gotta say.

838
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:30,751
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the 1942 Kai.

839
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:31,612
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a good one.

840
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:34,613
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to see the 1940XX ones remade.

841
01:06:34,633 --> 01:06:35,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't that be cool?

842
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:36,595
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be really sweet.

843
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:50,883
[SPEAKER_13]: But going back to the whole retro side of things, there's a hint that Igarashi is planning on doing a new Castlevania in 2D for Wii on WiiWare.

844
01:06:51,544 --> 01:06:52,604
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to be pretty cool.

845
01:06:52,624 --> 01:06:53,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

846
01:06:55,422 --> 01:07:04,007
[SPEAKER_13]: It's supposed to be trying to get back the interest into the original feel of the Castlevania series.

847
01:07:04,728 --> 01:07:14,534
[SPEAKER_13]: So he says that he's going to pay attention to how Mega Man 9 is with the market and base his decision on that.

848
01:07:14,854 --> 01:07:15,775
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's smart.

849
01:07:16,398 --> 01:07:19,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this trend Mega Man 9 seems to be starting.

850
01:07:19,719 --> 01:07:19,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah?

851
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:21,379
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be very good.

852
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:23,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's like, you know... It could also be very bad.

853
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:29,661
[SPEAKER_13]: We love our 2D, but no one wants to really admit it in the 3D market until someone just says, ah, screw it, we're doing it anyway.

854
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:33,082
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're like, hey, they're making money on this.

855
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:34,382
[SPEAKER_13]: It's safe.

856
01:07:34,482 --> 01:07:36,923
[SPEAKER_03]: For very little money into it, you know what I mean?

857
01:07:36,943 --> 01:07:38,123
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's do it!

858
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:41,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anyone ever said that, you know, they didn't like it.

859
01:07:41,184 --> 01:07:42,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't understand why they don't...

860
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:43,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

861
01:07:58,342 --> 01:07:59,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we make money too?

862
01:08:00,182 --> 01:08:02,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Could retro goodness be a money making machine?

863
01:08:03,183 --> 01:08:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the problem, hopefully the pool doesn't get diluted.

864
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:09,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then you'll see these other retro games that people aren't even going to care about and it's going to ruin everything.

865
01:08:10,165 --> 01:08:10,545
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

866
01:08:10,565 --> 01:08:16,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a lot harder for them to go back and actually remake something because that means they actually have to work on it.

867
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:24,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Versus I don't know, just like porting something from like PlayStation 2 or the GameCube.

868
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:26,128
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

869
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:35,603
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that's pretty exciting, and I don't know why I'm excited about it since I, up until a couple weeks ago, didn't know what the hell The Watchmen was.

870
01:08:36,784 --> 01:08:38,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it was a comic book series, but I haven't read it.

871
01:08:39,466 --> 01:08:40,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I am interested in reading it now.

872
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:44,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, at Comic-Con they announced that they're going to be making...

873
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:48,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Watchmen Episodic Games on the PC, PS3, and the 360

874
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:15,825
[SPEAKER_04]: and they are actually going to be prequels to the movie and the storylines so that's kind of cool and they showed off some footage of it and the first kind of level that they showed off was with Night Owl and Rorschach and it was kind of

875
01:09:17,165 --> 01:09:17,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

876
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:39,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks good.

877
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:40,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait to see it.

878
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:47,782
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in our chat room wanted to point out, Loki, Warner Brothers is also releasing a series of animated digital comics of The Watchmen on iTunes.

879
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,243
[SPEAKER_03]: The first chapter is free.

880
01:09:49,743 --> 01:09:50,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

881
01:09:50,804 --> 01:09:53,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're into The Watchmen, this is a very happy period of time for you.

882
01:09:55,087 --> 01:10:00,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a very happy period of time for Geometry Wars fans Because Geometry Wars 2 is coming And guess what?

883
01:10:01,074 --> 01:10:11,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlike most Xbox Live Arcade news we usually have It's coming earlier than anticipated That's great news It's coming this week, July 30th is the big day for Geometry Wars 2 The bad news...

884
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:13,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

885
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:47,678
[SPEAKER_04]: None of the multiplayer is online anyways because with a game like this, they can't have multiplayer online.

886
01:10:47,798 --> 01:10:48,198
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

887
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:52,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobby wants to remind you guys there is a trailer on Xbox Live for the new Geometry Wars.

888
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:52,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there is.

889
01:10:52,702 --> 01:10:53,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I downloaded it and checked it out.

890
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:54,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty neat.

891
01:10:55,204 --> 01:10:58,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if the graphics are really going to come out with that softer tone to them because it kind of looks neat.

892
01:10:59,448 --> 01:11:01,249
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics have this kind of adjusted...

893
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:05,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's just the early screenshots or what, but I have a feeling this might be the final product.

894
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:10,372
[SPEAKER_03]: This adjusted soft tone to them that makes it look like an old Vectrex game or something.

895
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:13,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they put Vaseline on the camera lens.

896
01:11:13,793 --> 01:11:17,634
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds better than Loki's describing it.

897
01:11:17,654 --> 01:11:20,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives it a real soft look to it that gives it an old 80s game flair.

898
01:11:20,675 --> 01:11:21,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of cool.

899
01:11:21,696 --> 01:11:22,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.

900
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:23,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

901
01:11:23,336 --> 01:11:26,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be awesome to have Geometry Wars on a Vectrex?

902
01:11:26,337 --> 01:11:27,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Like someone to do a homebrew game?

903
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.

904
01:11:28,538 --> 01:11:29,358
[SPEAKER_04]: People are pretty crazy.

905
01:11:30,206 --> 01:11:34,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, this is now the part of the show where we're going to take a quick break.

906
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:37,129
[SPEAKER_03]: But not until we get to the classic game of the week.

907
01:11:37,149 --> 01:11:41,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we always, before the break, like to talk a little bit about the past and retro gaming goodness.

908
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:46,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, how appropriate, following a story about Geometry Wars 2, which is a little bit of a throwback to retro gaming.

909
01:11:46,833 --> 01:11:52,395
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is going to dig through her archives and find an actual retro game that you all ought to check out.

910
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,416
[SPEAKER_03]: And this week's title...

911
01:11:54,016 --> 01:11:54,336
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

912
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:20,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The classic game of the week is a game that was on the Neo Geo systems put out by Saurus is the developer.

913
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:22,196
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Shock Troopers.

914
01:12:23,116 --> 01:12:24,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Shock Troopers is really freaking awesome.

915
01:12:26,037 --> 01:12:33,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, basically, imagine how, like, a plane shooter game would be, except you're running on the ground, and that's what you've got.

916
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:42,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you, um, basically you can, uh, fire your guns in, uh, eight directions, you can strafe, you can, um...

917
01:12:44,145 --> 01:12:49,792
[SPEAKER_13]: If you attack point blank, you can actually get items and bonuses and power-ups and extra life, things like that.

918
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:52,796
[SPEAKER_13]: You actually have a dodge button, too.

919
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:59,064
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a team battle mode where you can pick different soldiers in the game and everything.

920
01:13:01,807 --> 01:13:14,961
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, one of the cool things about this is that it was actually... From what I understand, it was actually sort of intended on being a nod to Metal Slug.

921
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:19,346
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's actually pretty cool, even though it completely is in a different...

922
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,168
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to play this game as Big Mama.

923
01:13:22,188 --> 01:13:22,869
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds awesome.

924
01:13:46,929 --> 01:13:56,176
[SPEAKER_13]: As you go through the game, you can actually pick a different path, the jungle, mountain, or valley, and you can switch to a different route or continue on the same.

925
01:13:56,776 --> 01:13:59,858
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's basically sort of a running gun sort of game.

926
01:13:59,918 --> 01:14:01,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, the guy has a flamethrower right now.

927
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:02,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Ikari Warriors.

928
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like Ikari Warriors.

929
01:14:03,681 --> 01:14:05,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a lot like Ikari Warriors.

930
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:05,803
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot more souped up.

931
01:14:06,796 --> 01:14:20,384
[SPEAKER_13]: and there's also one called Shock Trooper Second Squad that's supposed to be standalone, no connection, and you can only choose four characters and it has no team mode.

932
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:32,291
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also a little bit more cartoony and the sprites have sort of a rendered feel to them because it's actually, well, it's completely 2D, the 3D graphics are pre-rendered, so...

933
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:36,411
[SPEAKER_13]: There's actually a release on PlayStation 2 and PSP.

934
01:14:37,651 --> 01:14:38,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's pretty cool.

935
01:14:38,672 --> 01:14:42,454
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually, we got it in North America through the SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1.

936
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:44,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you can get it on the Wii, too.

937
01:14:44,716 --> 01:14:45,396
[SPEAKER_04]: That just came out.

938
01:14:46,997 --> 01:14:47,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

939
01:14:47,718 --> 01:14:49,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, SNK Arcade Classics.

940
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:51,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you meant on Virtual Console.

941
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:51,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, really?

942
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:52,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

943
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:52,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.

944
01:14:52,641 --> 01:14:53,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the music in it, too.

945
01:14:53,661 --> 01:14:55,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, you know... Let me turn it up a little bit so people can hear it.

946
01:15:00,253 --> 01:15:03,754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little hard to hear over the gunfire, but you get a sense for it.

947
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:08,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, huh?

948
01:15:09,237 --> 01:15:09,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty cool.

949
01:15:09,837 --> 01:15:13,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So there it is, your classic game of the week, Shock Troopers for the Neo Geo.

950
01:15:14,058 --> 01:15:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty awesome.

951
01:15:14,759 --> 01:15:16,539
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was just the Neo Geo arcade systems.

952
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, close enough.

953
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:21,581
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I take that back.

954
01:15:21,621 --> 01:15:22,542
[SPEAKER_13]: It did come out on the AVS.

955
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, couldn't you get just about any arcade game?

956
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,123
[SPEAKER_13]: It did come out on the AVS.

957
01:15:26,744 --> 01:15:27,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a hard to find one?

958
01:15:28,345 --> 01:15:28,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so.

959
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:30,627
[SPEAKER_13]: I just had forgotten about it.

960
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:31,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

961
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:39,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there you have it, Shock Troopers, your classic game of the week, and we are going to take a quick break, but we will be back in just a minute with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

962
01:15:39,656 --> 01:15:51,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we are, this is probably the last time I'll remind you guys, we are one big show now, so if you're listening on the podcast, just stay tuned, and we're going to take a free break, and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

963
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:53,028
[SPEAKER_03]: For those listening live, we've got some music coming your way.

964
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:53,509
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back.

965
01:16:00,131 --> 01:16:02,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, this is your buddy Rob Roberts here.

966
01:16:02,773 --> 01:16:06,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, I have become appalled at some of the language that people use on Xbox Live.

967
01:16:07,235 --> 01:16:08,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, stop spewing hate speech on Xbox Live.

968
01:16:08,616 --> 01:16:13,639
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make you look cool, it won't get you any friends, and at the end of the day, you still have an incredibly small penis.

969
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:35,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Gaming Radio.

970
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:43,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

971
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:44,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio.

972
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

973
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:56,027
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live here on this lovely Sunday evening, July the 27th, 2008.

[SPEAKER_03]: For more of the same great gaming news and chat and your comments at chat.orangeloungeradio

975
01:17:06,464 --> 01:17:07,445
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're halfway there.

976
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:09,925
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got plenty more news to cover tonight.

977
01:17:10,785 --> 01:17:11,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get right into it.

978
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:13,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, start us off.

979
01:17:16,426 --> 01:17:19,327
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can put down your DS for five minutes, come back to the show.

980
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:21,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, am I interrupting something, Loki?

981
01:17:22,008 --> 01:17:22,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just playing Core 10 DS.

982
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:25,428
[SPEAKER_04]: There are rumors via leaked pictures of a PSP case.

983
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:37,732
[SPEAKER_04]: saying that the PSP-3000 is in works right now.

984
01:17:37,772 --> 01:17:44,894
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, this supposedly leaked picture is of one of the designs that they, I don't know, didn't go with.

985
01:17:45,555 --> 01:18:00,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the features on this design, which may reflect some of the changes that we'll see in the final PSP-3000 design, includes a built-in microphone and that they replaced the home button with a PlayStation button, much like on the PSP-3000.

986
01:18:01,621 --> 01:18:04,263
[SPEAKER_04]: PS3, Sixaxis, or DualShock 3 controllers.

987
01:18:04,683 --> 01:18:06,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'm not too surprised by that.

988
01:18:08,486 --> 01:18:15,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That might also explain why we don't have the microphone attachment out here yet, because there may be a whole other PSP coming out.

989
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure this one will be completely unhackable.

990
01:18:20,515 --> 01:18:22,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, because Sony prevented that now.

991
01:18:23,077 --> 01:18:25,499
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, we're putting stuff to this right now.

992
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:26,000
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

993
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only taken us a few years, but we're putting stuff to it.

994
01:18:29,202 --> 01:18:29,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

995
01:18:29,762 --> 01:18:30,223
[SPEAKER_03]: No more.

996
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:32,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what do you think?

997
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it time for the PSP to get a remodel, or is it too soon?

998
01:18:36,732 --> 01:18:37,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it drive sales?

999
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:41,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to drive sales.

1000
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:44,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It might a little bit because they have a built-in microphone.

1001
01:18:44,116 --> 01:18:48,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It may allow them to do more things with it, depending on what features they add to it.

1002
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:57,183
[SPEAKER_04]: With a built-in microphone, you can play crappy karaoke games, you can do the stupid stuff that they do with the DS, where you can blow into the microphone to do things.

1003
01:18:58,544 --> 01:18:58,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1004
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:05,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be kind of cool to do really crappy Skype without using a headset with it.

1005
01:19:05,595 --> 01:19:06,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's true.

1006
01:19:06,235 --> 01:19:07,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Voice over IP, possibly.

1007
01:19:08,936 --> 01:19:10,196
[SPEAKER_03]: You could do some side talking.

1008
01:19:10,236 --> 01:19:14,917
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Sony fans, next time someone tries to tell you the PSP blows, you can say, yes, it does.

1009
01:19:16,037 --> 01:19:16,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1010
01:19:17,938 --> 01:19:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you blow on the PSP.

1011
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:19,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You blow the PSP.

1012
01:19:21,218 --> 01:19:22,179
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go blow the PSP.

1013
01:19:25,475 --> 01:19:27,897
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1014
01:19:48,294 --> 01:19:49,375
[SPEAKER_03]: The Feminist Gamers

1015
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:07,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Great displeasure to Sony.

1016
01:20:08,377 --> 01:20:11,200
[SPEAKER_03]: In Shakespeare, they said, quote, Congrats on your awesome new game, Sony.

1017
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm positively thrilled to see such unyielding dedication to creating a new generation of fat-hating, heteronormative assholes.

1018
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Feminist Gamer...

1019
01:20:21,129 --> 01:20:29,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, instead of running out into the forest to find cake to fatten up the princess with, why not go out and find gold to stuff into a treasure chest?

1020
01:20:29,275 --> 01:20:32,197
[SPEAKER_03]: The more gold in the chest, the heavier it would be and the harder it would be to carry.

1021
01:20:33,098 --> 01:20:35,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously some women groups are getting very upset.

1022
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Titan Studios, the art director there, has actually came out and commented on the whole situation after this.

1023
01:20:42,465 --> 01:20:49,671
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually said, does it make it better or worse that the concept artist who designed the look, characters, and everything is a girl?

1024
01:20:50,492 --> 01:20:52,574
[SPEAKER_13]: How about they all just shut up and get over it?

1025
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,276
[SPEAKER_13]: Learn to be offended people.

1026
01:20:55,397 --> 01:21:03,144
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not, you know, if people got their, you know, less of a stick up their ass about certain things, I think the world would be a whole lot nicer, don't you?

1027
01:21:05,017 --> 01:21:07,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And notice how the game is called Fat Princess.

1028
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:09,398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not saying, like, all women are fat.

1029
01:21:09,558 --> 01:21:14,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they put out a game called that, I can see where people might get a little bit offended.

1030
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:17,879
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just a princess who happens to be fat.

1031
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:20,620
[SPEAKER_03]: But let us remember the Mika song.

1032
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:22,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Big girl, you are beautiful.

1033
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,141
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with, you know, this?

1034
01:21:26,181 --> 01:21:28,121
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just... It's innocent.

1035
01:21:28,161 --> 01:21:30,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people are just getting their feathers a little too ruffled over this.

1036
01:21:30,981 --> 01:21:31,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1037
01:21:33,562 --> 01:21:33,702
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1038
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:37,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Curious Chat Fat Princess Gets No Love Because She's Fat Fat Kirby

1039
01:21:58,789 --> 01:21:59,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Kirby's pretty fat.

1040
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:01,631
[SPEAKER_13]: How about this?

1041
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:13,419
[SPEAKER_13]: How about lose any sort of social, you know, the only reason that I think that there's such a bad social stigma about this is that people do get offended about it.

1042
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:19,523
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, why can't people just learn to accept themselves and to stop being so fucking offended?

1043
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:25,307
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't have a problem with weight, then don't worry about it.

1044
01:22:25,347 --> 01:22:26,428
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not your problem.

1045
01:22:27,524 --> 01:22:29,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get offended for people!

1046
01:22:29,265 --> 01:22:31,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't they just call the game, I Like Cake?

1047
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:32,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect!

1048
01:22:34,287 --> 01:22:34,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay!

1049
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:39,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Because seriously, if cake offends somebody, then there's just no pleasing you.

1050
01:22:39,709 --> 01:22:39,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

1051
01:22:40,729 --> 01:22:41,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I like cake.

1052
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I like cake.

1053
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:43,510
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.

1054
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:44,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, look at me.

1055
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:48,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, can we move on, please, before Loki offends me?

1056
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:50,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, guess what?

1057
01:22:51,223 --> 01:22:52,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Operation Ground and Pound Revolution Death Squad

1058
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:23,269
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to be 500 Microsoft points for those three.

1059
01:23:24,589 --> 01:23:25,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a good time.

1060
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:26,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Hell yeah.

1061
01:23:27,071 --> 01:23:27,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Dragon Force.

1062
01:23:27,912 --> 01:23:28,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Good stuff.

1063
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:32,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wonder if they're all going to be as freaking hard because that's going to suck.

1064
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:39,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one thing not coming to the PlayStation Network anytime soon is Wipeout HD.

1065
01:23:39,999 --> 01:23:42,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently it's being held up by epilepsy tests.

1066
01:23:42,761 --> 01:23:45,383
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is so hardcore it makes people have seizures.

1067
01:23:48,532 --> 01:23:49,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's offensive.

1068
01:23:50,632 --> 01:24:11,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently, I guess it's, according to computers and video games, Wipeout HD's delay is because a little bit more technical features, it's extra features, and apparently it needs to be re-engineered in order to pass the epilepsy test.

1069
01:24:12,156 --> 01:24:15,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine what would happen if Sony had neglected to do that?

1070
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how much poop they'd be in?

1071
01:24:17,817 --> 01:24:26,065
[SPEAKER_03]: In the general populace, if they had just forgot to make that kind of testing, and all these kids everywhere were having seizures because of a video game, oh my god.

1072
01:24:26,565 --> 01:24:30,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's a good thing they go through all these strict tests before a video game is released, huh?

1073
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:31,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1074
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:31,710
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way.

1075
01:24:32,431 --> 01:24:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing they have all those seizure warnings on manuals and stuff.

1076
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:36,395
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, too.

1077
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:39,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, the Dark Knight.

1078
01:24:39,744 --> 01:24:40,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the Dark Knight movie?

1079
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:42,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1080
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:42,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of neat?

1081
01:24:42,846 --> 01:24:43,746
[SPEAKER_09]: No, and I'm not going to.

1082
01:24:43,966 --> 01:24:44,246
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not?

1083
01:24:44,266 --> 01:24:45,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided I don't want to see it.

1084
01:24:45,227 --> 01:24:45,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1085
01:24:45,807 --> 01:24:46,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't bad.

1086
01:24:46,387 --> 01:24:46,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It was long.

1087
01:24:47,168 --> 01:24:48,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I've decided I don't want to see it.

1088
01:24:48,949 --> 01:24:49,289
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1089
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:50,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, your choice.

1090
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:52,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Movies are expensive these days.

1091
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:53,811
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $10 to go see a movie.

1092
01:24:54,471 --> 01:24:56,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they are making a video game based on the Dark Knight.

1093
01:24:57,213 --> 01:24:57,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised.

1094
01:24:58,133 --> 01:25:00,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know, big surprise, that's not news, right?

1095
01:25:00,074 --> 01:25:01,855
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess they've kind of kept this all under wraps.

1096
01:25:02,155 --> 01:25:12,500
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually Gary Oldman in an interview kind of spilled the beans that the game was coming out, and it caused this whole little controversy where a video was out, and then it was pulled, and now it's out again, and all this other dumb stuff going on.

1097
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention that it was also leaked by IGN before that.

1098
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:18,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, seriously, duh, there's going to be a Dark Knight game.

1099
01:25:18,523 --> 01:25:20,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh, duh, duh.

1100
01:25:20,104 --> 01:25:24,086
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been making Batman games ever since the old NES Batman game, which was actually pretty rad.

1101
01:25:24,586 --> 01:25:25,807
[SPEAKER_03]: The old Batman game was awesome.

1102
01:25:25,907 --> 01:25:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The old Batman game was awesome.

1103
01:25:27,027 --> 01:25:30,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman Returns, less awesome, but the original Batman game was pretty awesome.

1104
01:25:30,889 --> 01:25:32,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's even Lego Batman and all this crap, anyway.

1105
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:48,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But The Dark Knight, kind of funny enough, it was not there at E3, but it is still coming out, and I'm imagining the game will be out probably around the time of the Blu-ray release of the movie and DVD release of the movie, which will be in time for Christmas, I imagine.

1106
01:25:48,858 --> 01:25:53,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Gary Oldman is quoted in the video saying, quote, it's hard to make a movie like this under the radar.

1107
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:55,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight The Game Joy

1108
01:26:12,165 --> 01:26:15,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, and by the way, I don't want to see it just because I'm sick of hearing about it.

1109
01:26:16,047 --> 01:26:16,968
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I don't want to see it.

1110
01:26:18,168 --> 01:26:18,408
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1111
01:26:18,448 --> 01:26:22,730
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, it doesn't make it any worse of a movie though.

1112
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:23,431
[SPEAKER_03]: But I understand.

1113
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Hype machine sometimes kills things.

1114
01:26:25,412 --> 01:26:30,835
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll kind of like, you know, if you hear all this hype, this hype, this hype about something and you watch it and you go, it's good but it's not great.

1115
01:26:30,875 --> 01:26:32,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what a lot of people are saying about Batman.

1116
01:26:32,836 --> 01:26:35,457
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good but it's not that great of all this hype.

1117
01:26:35,597 --> 01:26:37,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really care about seeing the last one either.

1118
01:26:38,358 --> 01:26:39,139
[SPEAKER_13]: I just saw it at home.

1119
01:26:39,719 --> 01:26:40,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with my husband.

1120
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't see one until I get a Two-Face-only movie.

1121
01:26:59,932 --> 01:27:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say anything because it's a spoiler.

1122
01:27:01,413 --> 01:27:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I already know.

1123
01:27:02,193 --> 01:27:03,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to back up for that.

1124
01:27:03,114 --> 01:27:03,694
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say this.

1125
01:27:03,734 --> 01:27:04,275
[SPEAKER_13]: I already know.

1126
01:27:04,395 --> 01:27:06,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I also paid $10 to see Mamma Mia this week.

1127
01:27:06,856 --> 01:27:07,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Now that I would see.

1128
01:27:08,317 --> 01:27:10,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to see X-Files as soon as I get a chance.

1129
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:11,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I will only see Mamma Mia again.

1130
01:27:12,259 --> 01:27:12,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1131
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard the X-Files movie's not hot.

1132
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:17,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't... It's fan service, though.

1133
01:27:17,822 --> 01:27:19,143
[SPEAKER_03]: If you watch the show, you'll probably like it.

1134
01:27:19,924 --> 01:27:20,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay through the credits.

1135
01:27:21,284 --> 01:27:22,845
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to miss that one.

1136
01:27:23,326 --> 01:27:28,789
[SPEAKER_13]: My point is that I want to form my own judgment on it, so I'm going to just see it for myself.

1137
01:27:29,482 --> 01:27:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

1138
01:27:29,902 --> 01:27:33,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't see Mamma Mia again, though, until they let the audience sing along with the movie.

1139
01:27:35,044 --> 01:27:38,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, how about the new Dexter game that's coming out for iPhones?

1140
01:27:38,766 --> 01:27:40,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you remember us talking about that before?

1141
01:27:41,787 --> 01:27:51,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, Mark Echo, who does that clothing line and does graffiti, is actually supposed to be working with it, I do believe.

1142
01:27:51,871 --> 01:27:51,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And

1143
01:27:53,732 --> 01:28:17,092
[SPEAKER_13]: his development company is actually making the game and it's going to be an episodic content and as far as I know I do believe that Dexter is a show about a serial killer who is a splatter analysis for the Miami Police Department so it's a very interesting premise and I think the game has a good promise

1144
01:28:17,352 --> 01:28:22,357
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a serial killer that kills serial killers because he has the urge to kill people, but he doesn't want to.

1145
01:28:23,518 --> 01:28:24,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So he kills serial killers.

1146
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,982
[SPEAKER_13]: That's extra special.

1147
01:28:27,503 --> 01:28:30,526
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Showtime, which means it can be on movies.

1148
01:28:30,986 --> 01:28:32,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Which means I won't watch it.

1149
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:37,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've run it on CBS a couple times during the writer's strike and stuff when they needed programming.

1150
01:28:37,743 --> 01:28:40,504
[SPEAKER_03]: But it sounds like it could be an interesting game.

1151
01:28:41,004 --> 01:28:41,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1152
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:42,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Keyword.

1153
01:28:42,445 --> 01:28:45,807
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to see what episodic content they're thinking of.

1154
01:28:45,947 --> 01:28:48,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact it's on the iPhone, of all things.

1155
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:49,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

1156
01:28:50,289 --> 01:28:51,410
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how it turns out, I guess.

1157
01:28:51,770 --> 01:28:53,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Tap here to murder.

1158
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold Banjo in chat says, I see that show every once in a while and I think it's awesome.

1159
01:28:57,879 --> 01:28:58,900
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard a lot of people like it.

1160
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, since I don't have show time, I don't really watch it.

1161
01:29:01,863 --> 01:29:03,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat.OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to comment.

1162
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:08,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, last week we talked a little bit how there were rumors that Grand Theft Auto 4 was coming out on the PC.

1163
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:10,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now there's even more confirmation of this.

1164
01:29:11,192 --> 01:29:14,435
[SPEAKER_04]: First, starting off with the PC Gamer Magazine from Malaysia.

1165
01:29:14,455 --> 01:29:19,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know that's not exactly in the US or UK or whatever, but

1166
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:22,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, it's on the cover, so that's got to say something, right?

1167
01:29:23,804 --> 01:29:25,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had a big little article about that.

1168
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, there was a posting which is now removed on the ESRB website.

1169
01:29:32,472 --> 01:29:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, no one got the memo over at ESRB.

1170
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:37,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that is entirely accurate.

1171
01:29:37,157 --> 01:29:37,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1172
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,221
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm sure it will be coming to PC.

1173
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:03,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a surprise.

1174
01:30:03,522 --> 01:30:06,343
[SPEAKER_04]: All the last few have, so it makes sense.

1175
01:30:06,923 --> 01:30:08,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And this means hello hacking.

1176
01:30:09,624 --> 01:30:12,465
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm most interested in, is all the mods for it.

1177
01:30:12,485 --> 01:30:13,526
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

1178
01:30:13,546 --> 01:30:13,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Reskinning.

1179
01:30:15,766 --> 01:30:16,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make predictions.

1180
01:30:17,147 --> 01:30:22,109
[SPEAKER_03]: How many days before Grand Theft Auto 4 PC has a topless mod?

1181
01:30:22,789 --> 01:30:24,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Meaning all the women walk around topless.

1182
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:31,770
[SPEAKER_03]: 10.

1183
01:30:28,529 --> 01:30:31,770
[SPEAKER_03]: 10?

1184
01:30:29,669 --> 01:30:31,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I say it comes out before the game's even on shelves.

1185
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:35,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it'll get pirated before the game's even out, and somebody makes the mod before the game even comes out.

1186
01:30:36,771 --> 01:30:37,251
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it.

1187
01:30:38,631 --> 01:30:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, also coming out, and another port that's highly anticipated, although of a completely different type, it's the game Peggle, the PopCap game that's kind of like Plinko on Crack.

1188
01:30:49,853 --> 01:30:50,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've played this game.

1189
01:30:50,993 --> 01:30:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy it on the iPod, and I bet there'll be a lot of DS people who like this game as well.

1190
01:30:55,194 --> 01:30:55,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1191
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:56,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1192
01:31:16,644 --> 01:31:41,307
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'll have a good idea what to expect on the DS later this year and it's fun you know for a casual game it's a lot of fun it's stupidly simple you just fire a ball down the little you know playing field it's I guess you could say the closest thing it resembles is like pinball in a way although you know pinball has ramps and you know other things that Peggle doesn't have but it's it's neat I enjoy Peggle it's a great iPod game it's almost made for the iPod

1193
01:31:42,946 --> 01:31:46,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, this is the part of the show where we're going to open it up to you guys to participate with us.

1194
01:31:46,468 --> 01:31:50,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little segment we have here on the show called the Orange Lounge Radio Mailbag.

1195
01:31:51,011 --> 01:32:01,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura picks a few of her favorites and reads them right here on air for us to respond to or make fun of depending on what kind of mood we're in.

1196
01:32:01,817 --> 01:32:05,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's open up ye olde mailbag and DarkSakura, take it away.

1197
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:06,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Music

1198
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:11,772
[SPEAKER_13]: First email comes from AZHP.

1199
01:32:11,992 --> 01:32:12,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, LLR crew.

1200
01:32:13,333 --> 01:32:35,286
[SPEAKER_13]: With all the talk about F-Zero GX being one of the greatest racers on last week's show and eager anticipation of a Wii title being announced, I figured I'd poke my head in and say that unfortunately Miyamoto went on record saying he was extremely disappointed in how Sega approached F-Zero GX slash AX and that if F-Zero were to be made for another console, it would not be in the same style as GX.

1201
01:32:35,806 --> 01:32:46,512
[SPEAKER_13]: This is probably because it was too difficult, hard, confusing, but in my opinion it was really one of the greatest racers for the sense of speed and chaos that came with playing the game, even at the rookie difficulty levels.

1202
01:32:46,872 --> 01:32:51,875
[SPEAKER_13]: The game was critically acclaimed as well and received higher than 8 over 10 for most game reviewers.

1203
01:32:53,476 --> 01:33:02,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I, for one, love, love, loved F-Zero GX, and am more than excited at the thought of another F-Zero game, especially in HD, but unfortunately it probably will never come to pass.

1204
01:33:02,203 --> 01:33:10,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hope Miyamoto comes to his senses and greenlights this game, because honestly, how could anyone not like that game, aside from getting terribly motion sick on it or something.

1205
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:17,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep up the great work, and P.S., I went to Disneyland for the first time in about 15 years, and I now realize why you guys trip down there so often.

1206
01:33:17,976 --> 01:33:19,598
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is a place where dreams come true.

1207
01:33:20,658 --> 01:33:21,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been in like a year.

1208
01:33:23,219 --> 01:33:25,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have my pass anymore.

1209
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:32,302
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, F-Zero, I mean, I think it's stupid that they won't do another one just because they don't think it'll work.

1210
01:33:32,462 --> 01:33:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll think of some stupid Wii feature to implement in it that'll make it worthwhile.

1211
01:33:36,263 --> 01:33:36,944
[SPEAKER_03]: At least I hope.

1212
01:33:37,084 --> 01:33:37,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope.

1213
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:42,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're right, it's critically acclaimed and gamers that bought it loved it.

1214
01:33:43,606 --> 01:33:44,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do it.

1215
01:33:44,946 --> 01:33:46,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope a miracle pulls through.

1216
01:33:46,767 --> 01:33:49,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to hold my breath, but it would just be great.

1217
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:55,714
[SPEAKER_13]: How about Miyamoto realized that maybe they should actually give gamers what they want?

1218
01:33:56,334 --> 01:33:59,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't there actually a DSF-0 after AXGX?

1219
01:33:59,657 --> 01:34:00,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1220
01:34:00,538 --> 01:34:01,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought there was.

1221
01:34:01,779 --> 01:34:02,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be wrong.

1222
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been before, but I seem to remember there was one after.

1223
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,362
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, next email.

1224
01:34:09,262 --> 01:34:09,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, OLR.

1225
01:34:10,564 --> 01:34:12,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And this comes from Ritual Insomnia.

1226
01:34:12,445 --> 01:34:13,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, J-Rod, sorry.

1227
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:13,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops, sorry.

1228
01:34:14,627 --> 01:34:20,932
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, I must say I'm thrilled beyond belief in your choice for putting out one podcast instead of two small ones.

1229
01:34:21,373 --> 01:34:24,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I work 10-hour days and look forward to listening to you guys on Fridays.

1230
01:34:24,715 --> 01:34:28,679
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for making the decision for one podcast so I can get you earlier and make Mondays easier.

1231
01:34:29,259 --> 01:34:31,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm emailing because I have a hard decision to make.

1232
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:37,342
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys had your E3 wrap-up show, which was great, but failed to even mention a huge title, Gears of War 2.

1233
01:34:37,743 --> 01:34:44,225
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm absolutely stoked for this game, and you didn't even mention a peep about the level playthrough at Microsoft's keynote.

1234
01:34:45,105 --> 01:34:46,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually didn't think about it, sorry.

1235
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:48,727
[SPEAKER_13]: This puts me in a position.

1236
01:34:48,807 --> 01:34:51,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know whether to chainsaw your ferret or not.

1237
01:34:51,448 --> 01:34:52,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you can't get to the ferret, so you can't.

1238
01:34:54,289 --> 01:34:58,331
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you did make up for it by having a discussion about the new game, Silent Hill...

1239
01:34:59,672 --> 01:35:01,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, you used game a bunch of times.

1240
01:35:01,716 --> 01:35:06,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Homecoming and declared a pyramid head day, but you dissed the good old-fashioned curb-stomping sequel.

1241
01:35:07,907 --> 01:35:11,292
[SPEAKER_13]: How are the humans supposed to win the fight against the locusts without your support?

1242
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:17,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Marcus says Chainsaw, Dahlia Gillespie says for me to be nice.

1243
01:35:18,123 --> 01:35:19,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what to do with you people.

1244
01:35:19,744 --> 01:35:23,307
[SPEAKER_13]: This email is sponsored by the Olive Garden Home of the Neverending Salads and Breadsticks.

1245
01:35:23,347 --> 01:35:24,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Now stop ripping off my signature fools.

1246
01:35:26,009 --> 01:35:26,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, seriously.

1247
01:35:27,231 --> 01:35:28,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like I forgot about Gears of War 2.

1248
01:35:29,352 --> 01:35:30,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not forget about Gears of War 2.

1249
01:35:30,874 --> 01:35:31,855
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a lot of news.

1250
01:35:32,967 --> 01:35:33,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't care.

1251
01:35:34,408 --> 01:35:35,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly didn't fucking care.

1252
01:35:35,788 --> 01:35:37,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated Gears of War 1 and Gears of War 2.

1253
01:35:38,169 --> 01:35:38,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

1254
01:35:38,589 --> 01:35:39,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying it.

1255
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:41,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, there's enough news out there.

1256
01:35:41,991 --> 01:35:45,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I really need to mention that they played through the level of Gears of War 2?

1257
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:48,233
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't need to because guess what?

1258
01:35:48,313 --> 01:35:50,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't talk about every single demo that they had there.

1259
01:35:51,275 --> 01:35:52,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously.

1260
01:35:52,395 --> 01:35:54,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War 2 wasn't really at E3, it was just at the keynote.

1261
01:36:13,144 --> 01:36:16,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War 2 will be playable at PAX Half of Microsoft's booth will be Gears 2

1262
01:36:36,496 --> 01:36:36,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War 2

1263
01:37:02,347 --> 01:37:03,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Next email.

1264
01:37:04,388 --> 01:37:06,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Good Sunday evening to you, OLR.

1265
01:37:06,409 --> 01:37:08,650
[SPEAKER_13]: I trust that everyone's been having a nice week so far.

1266
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:14,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, I'd like to say I'm kind of slow in catching up on the past couple of episodes because I can't store them onto my iPod anymore.

1267
01:37:15,594 --> 01:37:21,536
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a one gigabyte shuffle and I carry around wherever I go, and I can usually save 50-ish megabytes for OLR.

1268
01:37:22,077 --> 01:37:26,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Since the newer episodes are 70 megabytes now, I'm struggling to make ends meet on my iPod.

1269
01:37:27,299 --> 01:37:28,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice format, though.

1270
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:37,684
[SPEAKER_13]: When I heard the news about Final Fantasy XIII being a 360 release as well, I tried thinking of PS3 exclusives.

1271
01:37:38,105 --> 01:37:47,209
[SPEAKER_13]: While the first-party fare has been from decent Motorstorm to the best games I've ever played, Metal Gear Solid 4, I've yet to see many good third-party games.

1272
01:37:47,389 --> 01:37:48,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Haze doesn't count.

1273
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:58,015
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm saying is that developers should put a little more faith into the PS3 by releasing original, innovative games, not just crappy added bonuses that were originally for DLC ports.

1274
01:37:59,215 --> 01:38:02,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it something with the cell processor that turns developers off?

1275
01:38:02,858 --> 01:38:05,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it the fact that more people own 360s?

1276
01:38:05,899 --> 01:38:09,702
[SPEAKER_13]: But I first can't wait for the Naruto PS3 game coming out in October though.

1277
01:38:10,442 --> 01:38:16,246
[SPEAKER_13]: One last thing, with the addition of Butterfly and WW and DDRX, I think that Konami has gone too far in reminiscing.

1278
01:38:17,847 --> 01:38:24,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, sure, those are a couple of the best songs DDR has offered in its 10 years, but it just seems a little dated.

1279
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:28,325
[SPEAKER_13]: The additions are like a slutty girlfriend.

1280
01:38:28,846 --> 01:38:30,988
[SPEAKER_13]: She may be nice and all, but who hasn't done her?

1281
01:38:31,688 --> 01:38:32,269
[SPEAKER_13]: That's funny.

1282
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:37,433
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, any DDR player has played Butterfly at least 100 times in his or her life, right?

1283
01:38:37,873 --> 01:38:39,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Why add it in a console version now?

1284
01:38:40,395 --> 01:38:46,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's all I have to say for the past few weeks, and E3, while disappointing for some, did have some very high points.

1285
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:48,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Until next time, Katamari's forever.

1286
01:38:48,402 --> 01:38:51,785
[SPEAKER_13]: This message brought to you by Kenya, home of the never-ending American IP addresses.

1287
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:56,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry to hear that the new format's not working for you, buddy.

1288
01:38:56,623 --> 01:39:01,187
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously, there's always going to be people who love the idea and some people who don't like the idea.

1289
01:39:01,828 --> 01:39:05,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're able to negotiate 20 more megs on your iPod to make it work.

1290
01:39:05,671 --> 01:39:06,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope, one way or another.

1291
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:09,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's all I have to say.

1292
01:39:09,133 --> 01:39:11,395
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of it, you know, good thoughts.

1293
01:39:13,757 --> 01:39:14,278
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1294
01:39:14,778 --> 01:39:14,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1295
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:17,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Greetings, everyone.

1296
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:20,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here live from the laundromat showing some heart.

1297
01:39:20,783 --> 01:39:22,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you at the laundromat right now?

1298
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,206
[SPEAKER_13]: No, yeah, well, no, look at the time.

1299
01:39:26,586 --> 01:39:28,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Before I begin, there's a few things I'd like to say.

1300
01:39:29,126 --> 01:39:34,928
[SPEAKER_13]: To DarkSakura, I've said thank you like hundreds of times, but thank you again for everything when I came out to visit.

1301
01:39:35,608 --> 01:39:37,028
[SPEAKER_13]: I truly loved and enjoyed everything.

1302
01:39:37,068 --> 01:39:39,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Words cannot describe how much I appreciated your hospitality.

1303
01:39:39,869 --> 01:39:43,230
[SPEAKER_13]: When you come to NYC, I will give that back to you a thousandfold.

1304
01:39:43,270 --> 01:39:44,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's so sweet.

1305
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:44,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1306
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:47,994
[SPEAKER_13]: To Rob, I wish we had more time to hang out, not enough.

1307
01:39:48,494 --> 01:39:54,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for allowing me to be part of the show two weeks ago, and FYI, part of my reasoning for coming back was to be on the show.

1308
01:39:54,943 --> 01:40:01,352
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said before, when you come to New York City, I will give that back to you a thousandfold because you're so fabulous.

1309
01:40:02,193 --> 01:40:03,494
[SPEAKER_13]: To Loki, you're all right in my book.

1310
01:40:03,534 --> 01:40:07,115
[SPEAKER_13]: Too bad we didn't get a chance to talk more and be more chill.

1311
01:40:07,135 --> 01:40:09,016
[SPEAKER_13]: You were supposed to come join me and Jamie for lunch.

1312
01:40:09,396 --> 01:40:10,436
[SPEAKER_13]: I did call you a couple times.

1313
01:40:12,077 --> 01:40:14,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I was looking forward to that, you know, but it's okay.

1314
01:40:14,458 --> 01:40:17,439
[SPEAKER_13]: When you come out here to New York City, I will show you a damn good time.

1315
01:40:18,019 --> 01:40:19,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Now on to some other things.

1316
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:22,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh wow, this is a long email, sorry.

1317
01:40:23,742 --> 01:40:29,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I have said in the past that it would not surprise me that Square Enix would put Final Fantasy XII on Xbox 360.

1318
01:40:29,986 --> 01:40:32,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Square Enix, for saving my roommate $400 on a paperweight.

1319
01:40:37,771 --> 01:40:58,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the reason why they keep doing this and it's the same reason I feel that Konami will put Metal Gear Solid 4 on the Xbox 360 I'm not saying that because I'm a drooling fanboy but from a financial point of view the money that these companies are investing in the titles will not be made back on the PS3 due to the fact that it has a lower consumer home base and then the 360 that was the point actually I agree with

1320
01:40:58,989 --> 01:41:04,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Putting these titles on another next-gen platform will allow these companies to make back more money invested in these titles.

1321
01:41:05,234 --> 01:41:09,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And speaking of Konami, people are calling for others to not support Konami as a sad reality.

1322
01:41:09,557 --> 01:41:11,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand where you're coming from about this, though.

1323
01:41:11,538 --> 01:41:14,460
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole lawsuit with Konami vs. Viacom is not Konami's fault.

1324
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,664
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to blame Activision about this because they're the ones paying licensee fees to them for Guitar Hero.

1325
01:41:20,224 --> 01:41:26,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone is saying that Konami is too little too late, but people have forgotten that there's more to the companies besides Bemani.

1326
01:41:27,449 --> 01:41:31,457
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami has other titles such as Will Castlevania, Contra Metal Gear Solid, to name a few.

1327
01:41:31,878 --> 01:41:36,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Konami is focused on more drum than guitars if you look at the song list.

1328
01:41:38,004 --> 01:41:41,927
[SPEAKER_13]: I have heard people saying that the game looks like trash, but honestly, I like it.

1329
01:41:41,967 --> 01:41:51,834
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the gameplay screens, and what annoys me more is that the Bimani fanboys girls are going to foam at the mouth because of no Guitar Freaks Drum Mania tracks in the game.

1330
01:41:52,315 --> 01:41:58,799
[SPEAKER_13]: If Konami added a lot of those tracks, they would be alienating the casual gamer who has never heard of these songs and wouldn't bother to get the game.

1331
01:41:58,839 --> 01:42:00,080
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my two cents on it.

1332
01:42:01,261 --> 01:42:03,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Anywho, keep up the good work and don't stop believing.

1333
01:42:04,264 --> 01:42:10,431
[SPEAKER_13]: This email was brought to you by Joey Pisano's on Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy, home of the 5.95 lunch specials.

1334
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:11,412
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll love Pisano's.

1335
01:42:12,373 --> 01:42:16,657
[SPEAKER_13]: And also by Anime Jam Sessions, the newest anime cosplay podcast.

1336
01:42:16,677 --> 01:42:17,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheap plug.

1337
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:17,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1338
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:22,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Yeah, uh...

1339
01:42:24,711 --> 01:42:26,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what Black Wolf is saying in chat right now.

1340
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:26,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just reading.

1341
01:42:27,052 --> 01:42:29,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he like the dark gray note on the black background that you can't even see?

1342
01:42:29,853 --> 01:42:31,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's one of the symbols.

1343
01:42:32,014 --> 01:42:37,656
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't agree with him that if you put some Bumai tracks in there that alienate, you know.

1344
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:39,770
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1345
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:06,272
[SPEAKER_04]: A mainstream artist that everybody would love, I mean, because some people find them annoying, like me.

1346
01:43:07,673 --> 01:43:13,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And so some of the Guitar Hero tracks, or Guitar Freaks tracks, could easily be unlockable songs in that.

1347
01:43:14,336 --> 01:43:21,219
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no, that would be, you know, trying to even incorporate their old audience into it, oh, well that...

1348
01:43:22,549 --> 01:43:23,351
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awful.

1349
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:31,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would think they would want to do that because at least those people might buy your game whereas the other people may not buy your game.

1350
01:43:31,325 --> 01:43:35,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least try to get what sort of audience you have already to buy that game.

1351
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:41,572
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other topic, I agree with his reasoning for the Final Fantasy XIII on the Xbox 360.

1352
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:47,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes sense that they want to make sure they get all the development costs back by making sure they get a good share of the U.S.

1353
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,236
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.

1354
01:43:50,376 --> 01:43:56,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I think there would have been a lot of people that would have jumped ship to a PlayStation 3 just to get it for Final Fantasy XIII, myself being one of them.

1355
01:43:57,220 --> 01:43:59,761
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still generally agree with the ideas on why they're doing it.

1356
01:44:00,641 --> 01:44:01,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there you have it.

1357
01:44:03,323 --> 01:44:04,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more emails tonight?

1358
01:44:04,983 --> 01:44:05,084
[SPEAKER_13]: One.

1359
01:44:05,484 --> 01:44:05,784
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.

1360
01:44:07,202 --> 01:44:07,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, LLR!

1361
01:44:08,842 --> 01:44:09,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

1362
01:44:09,683 --> 01:44:15,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been thinking about starting to play World of Warcraft, but the $15 a month fee will take up most of my yearly gaming budget.

1363
01:44:16,364 --> 01:44:20,045
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like everyone's opinion on whether or not it is worth the fee.

1364
01:44:20,145 --> 01:44:24,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Guild Wars or another MMORPG without a fee a viable alternative?

1365
01:44:24,586 --> 01:44:27,767
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard that there are free private servers for World of Warcraft as well.

1366
01:44:28,147 --> 01:44:29,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Are these legitimate?

1367
01:44:29,347 --> 01:44:29,628
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1368
01:44:30,728 --> 01:44:31,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.

1369
01:44:32,028 --> 01:44:33,288
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep on keeping on, Seth.

1370
01:44:34,389 --> 01:44:34,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1371
01:44:35,949 --> 01:45:00,605
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly World of Warcraft I got very burned on it very quickly I suggest if you can find like a trial try out a trial of it you know see how you like it but Guild Wars I think will be better for your money if you're wanting to play a legitimate game that has a user base already or you know go old school like a bunch of us are and play on a free Ragnarok online server

1372
01:45:01,936 --> 01:45:05,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, though, that Guild Wars is a viable alternative to World of Warcraft.

1373
01:45:05,418 --> 01:45:05,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's different.

1374
01:45:05,958 --> 01:45:08,259
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't say they're the same game, because they're not.

1375
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:14,281
[SPEAKER_03]: At a glance, they look the same, and even when you're first playing them, you're like, oh, there's a lot of similarities.

1376
01:45:14,301 --> 01:45:16,903
[SPEAKER_03]: But kind of the way the endgame works is much different.

1377
01:45:17,263 --> 01:45:22,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Guild Wars is really about guilds warring in the final endstages.

1378
01:45:22,905 --> 01:45:24,726
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only 20 levels in the game, after all.

1379
01:45:25,086 --> 01:45:26,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can download the client online.

1380
01:45:55,397 --> 01:46:00,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very easy to check out the game and judge for yourself because you get a pretty decent amount of time to judge the game.

1381
01:46:01,826 --> 01:46:06,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually sort of had the thought of giving it one more go myself.

1382
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:15,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I got really annoyed with it, but I figured if I... And this is what I always do, is that I play for a couple months and quit again.

1383
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:21,045
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I guess with being in school, I'm not going to really have a whole lot of time to play.

1384
01:46:21,145 --> 01:46:23,948
[SPEAKER_13]: But I was thinking of maybe giving it another go.

1385
01:46:24,388 --> 01:46:25,850
[SPEAKER_13]: It got really boring.

1386
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:27,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Blood elves are hot.

1387
01:46:27,411 --> 01:46:28,092
[SPEAKER_10]: They are.

1388
01:46:28,733 --> 01:46:29,934
[SPEAKER_10]: But it got really boring.

1389
01:46:30,768 --> 01:46:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't think they were around when you were playing last time.

1390
01:46:32,910 --> 01:46:33,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was.

1391
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:34,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I couldn't remember.

1392
01:46:34,851 --> 01:46:35,972
[SPEAKER_10]: I had just upgraded.

1393
01:46:36,812 --> 01:46:37,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow, okay.

1394
01:46:37,213 --> 01:46:39,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember... That's right.

1395
01:46:39,594 --> 01:46:39,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

1396
01:46:40,215 --> 01:46:40,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember.

1397
01:46:40,575 --> 01:46:40,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1398
01:46:42,116 --> 01:46:42,416
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1399
01:46:42,976 --> 01:46:43,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for the email then.

1400
01:46:44,117 --> 01:46:44,357
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1401
01:46:44,397 --> 01:46:48,480
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com is the place to send those emails.

1402
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:52,123
[SPEAKER_03]: For now, Loki's going to take us back to some gaming news with a very familiar topic.

1403
01:46:52,622 --> 01:46:55,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, how ironic, all of this.

1404
01:46:56,564 --> 01:47:06,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War 2, there's some new things been announced about it, including that they're going to have some content for Gears of War 2 unlocked by achievements that you've earned from Gears of War 1.

1405
01:47:07,408 --> 01:47:12,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And they gave a couple examples of unlockable characters based on different achievements that you had.

1406
01:47:12,431 --> 01:47:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

1407
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:29,944
[SPEAKER_04]: and also there's supposed to be one uber bundle coming for it kind of like the legendary edition for Halo 3 which will be the $130 Lancer bundle that will come with a Lancer yes a miniature replica model of a Lancer what game is this again?

1408
01:47:31,004 --> 01:47:42,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Gears of War 2 I'm getting Gears of War 2 it's not the same kind of Lancer that you're thinking of it's a chainsaw gun I still want one

1409
01:47:44,181 --> 01:47:44,561
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1410
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:46,002
[SPEAKER_13]: I like everything Lancer.

1411
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:48,403
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the whole achievements thing?

1412
01:47:49,824 --> 01:47:50,704
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole achievements thing?

1413
01:47:50,724 --> 01:47:50,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1414
01:47:51,184 --> 01:47:51,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mentioned that.

1415
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:52,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

1416
01:47:52,945 --> 01:47:53,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I spaced for a minute.

1417
01:47:54,646 --> 01:47:54,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1418
01:47:54,946 --> 01:47:55,666
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of it, though?

1419
01:47:55,706 --> 01:47:56,507
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an achievement horror.

1420
01:47:56,527 --> 01:47:57,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's kind of cool.

1421
01:47:57,767 --> 01:47:59,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's something they should implement in other games.

1422
01:47:59,768 --> 01:48:03,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It will get you to buy some of their older games, like Gears of War.

1423
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:05,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially for the achievement horror in all of this.

1424
01:48:06,031 --> 01:48:06,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1425
01:48:06,431 --> 01:48:07,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You make the announcement now.

1426
01:48:08,072 --> 01:48:10,053
[SPEAKER_04]: They just released that Gears of War refresh.

1427
01:48:10,473 --> 01:48:12,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Time to buy your copy of that for like $39.99.

1428
01:48:13,054 --> 01:48:16,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get some achievements and you unlock some new stuff.

1429
01:48:17,275 --> 01:48:20,236
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to do that kind of with Burnout, actually.

1430
01:48:20,256 --> 01:48:23,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Burnout 3 and stuff like that?

1431
01:48:24,758 --> 01:48:25,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Burnout Revenge actually did this.

1432
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:31,100
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had a game save for Burnout 3, you got a car from Burnout 3.

1433
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:36,302
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also if you had a Madden save, you got the Madden van.

1434
01:48:37,162 --> 01:48:39,085
[SPEAKER_04]: in Burnout.

1435
01:48:39,145 --> 01:48:42,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they don't do this more often, but whatever.

1436
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1437
01:48:46,183 --> 01:48:47,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, I like the idea.

1438
01:48:48,184 --> 01:48:50,465
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know if I would go buy a game just for more achievements.

1439
01:48:50,906 --> 01:48:55,989
[SPEAKER_03]: But one game I am definitely considering buying is Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe because I actually like Mortal Kombat quite a bit.

1440
01:48:56,449 --> 01:49:02,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though I'm not as huge into comic books as some other people, I think the DC Universe characters are pretty good.

1441
01:49:02,954 --> 01:49:11,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, tons of people have Joker fever right now because of the new movie that just came out and the gazillions of dollars it's making and so on and so on.

1442
01:49:11,639 --> 01:49:12,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people...

1443
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:13,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Jax and Katana Green Lantern Green Lantern

1444
01:49:41,577 --> 01:49:43,118
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be pretty cool.

1445
01:49:43,298 --> 01:49:43,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you have it.

1446
01:49:44,779 --> 01:49:54,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the question is, since villains supposedly could have fatalities, even though heroes count because of the whole DC Comics rules, could the Joker kill people in the game?

1447
01:49:55,429 --> 01:49:55,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1448
01:49:57,991 --> 01:50:01,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I think even if they're fatalities, they're going to be really kind of softened down.

1449
01:50:01,634 --> 01:50:02,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to see any head ripping.

1450
01:50:03,363 --> 01:50:07,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, if it's the Joker, you don't know what he's going to do.

1451
01:50:08,487 --> 01:50:13,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that if they give him fatalities, they either should or shouldn't go off at random.

1452
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:18,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if he pulled out a gun, it'd either blow their head off or punch him with a big fist or something.

1453
01:50:18,733 --> 01:50:19,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice idea.

1454
01:50:19,234 --> 01:50:19,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1455
01:50:19,614 --> 01:50:20,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Or say bang.

1456
01:50:21,055 --> 01:50:21,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Because this is the Joker.

1457
01:50:22,436 --> 01:50:24,097
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't know what he's going to do.

1458
01:50:24,257 --> 01:50:25,718
[SPEAKER_13]: He does this to freak you out.

1459
01:50:26,636 --> 01:50:27,296
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

1460
01:50:27,917 --> 01:50:29,097
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be very Joker.

1461
01:50:29,417 --> 01:50:33,419
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, you know, you get like bang, bang, bang, you know, three things in a row.

1462
01:50:33,759 --> 01:50:36,661
[SPEAKER_13]: And right when you think, oh, it's not going to happen, boom, headshot.

1463
01:50:38,522 --> 01:50:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: GameGuru hypothesizes that Joker will use his laughing gas in our chat room.

1464
01:50:44,644 --> 01:50:48,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Zene in chat says Jax was booed when he first came up at the panel.

1465
01:50:48,546 --> 01:50:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: That's sad.

1466
01:50:49,107 --> 01:50:49,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Jax is cool.

1467
01:50:49,727 --> 01:50:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: He has metal arms because he's got his own fatality done on him somehow.

1468
01:50:54,089 --> 01:50:54,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

1469
01:50:58,103 --> 01:51:01,726
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to say that I have some interesting news.

1470
01:51:02,166 --> 01:51:02,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

1471
01:51:03,587 --> 01:51:04,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, really.

1472
01:51:04,247 --> 01:51:05,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And this makes me quite happy.

1473
01:51:06,729 --> 01:51:16,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, I'm actually going to include something else that wasn't quite mentioned, well, that we don't have in show role, but ties into this, thanks to somebody else bringing it to my attention a few days ago.

1474
01:51:18,276 --> 01:51:23,619
[SPEAKER_13]: There is actually a rumor stating, and this actually was going on at a

1475
01:51:24,499 --> 01:51:38,308
[SPEAKER_13]: San Diego Comic Con 08 Marvel Studios President of Production was saying well they were actually asked if there would be another Marvel vs. Capcom and he said yes and maybe sooner than you think

1476
01:51:39,669 --> 01:51:54,455
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but the other thing I've been reading is that when, and you know I've covered this on the show before, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, which by the way, there's more stuff out, more characters in it, including Hurricane Polymer, Kashan, Gatchaman.

1477
01:51:56,236 --> 01:52:20,755
[SPEAKER_13]: uh the robot one I can never remember the name of um Techaman for for anyone who's like and also Batsu's in it from rival schools um uh Morrigan um just a bunch of you know characters but going back to the the Marvel uh versus Capcom tie-in is that they're actually saying that with um the current test machines being out in Japan for Tatsunoko versus Capcom that Marvel was sort of like uh we want to make money off of this again

1478
01:52:21,075 --> 01:52:22,816
[SPEAKER_13]: AJ Mix wants to see some Power Stone characters.

1479
01:52:37,222 --> 01:52:40,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, from what I understand, they have it for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1480
01:52:40,945 --> 01:52:43,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And actually, if you give me a second, I'll get the character list for you real quick.

1481
01:52:43,807 --> 01:52:48,431
[SPEAKER_13]: The actual full trailer for Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is actually up on YouTube right now.

1482
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:51,493
[SPEAKER_13]: You can find it easy just looking up Tatsunoko vs. Capcom.

1483
01:52:51,513 --> 01:52:52,374
[SPEAKER_13]: But give me just a quick sec.

1484
01:52:53,146 --> 01:52:54,347
[SPEAKER_03]: DC Comics, Marvel, DC Comics, DC Comics, DC Comics

1485
01:53:18,962 --> 01:53:21,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so far I don't have the full list of everything.

1486
01:53:22,506 --> 01:53:26,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, here's what we have so far for the list of Tatsunoko vs. Capcom characters.

1487
01:53:27,331 --> 01:53:39,965
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Owashi no Ken, who is a G1 for Gatchaman, Kashan from the Kashan anime, Techaman from Techaman the Space Knight, Yachaman number one from Yachaman, Hurricane Polymer,

1488
01:53:40,525 --> 01:53:43,107
[SPEAKER_13]: and GoldLighton from Golden Warrior, GoldLighton.

1489
01:53:43,328 --> 01:53:54,077
[SPEAKER_13]: And from Capcom, there's Ryu, Chun-Li, Batsu from Rival Schools, Alex from Street Fighter 3, Morgan from Darkstalkers, and Silky from Onimusha, Dawn of Dreams.

1490
01:53:54,938 --> 01:53:58,961
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's actually on location test in Tokyo right now.

1491
01:54:00,502 --> 01:54:08,764
[SPEAKER_13]: and hopefully, I've been hearing that there might actually be a bit more as far as an actual release date soon.

1492
01:54:08,864 --> 01:54:12,025
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, I'm pulling up another list here.

1493
01:54:12,245 --> 01:54:16,367
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying a December 2008 actual release window.

1494
01:54:16,947 --> 01:54:18,227
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's fairly cool.

1495
01:54:18,267 --> 01:54:20,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope they add more characters though.

1496
01:54:21,428 --> 01:54:21,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I really do.

1497
01:54:22,068 --> 01:54:26,089
[SPEAKER_13]: But the poster though seems to be pretty finalized, the one that they've got out now.

1498
01:54:27,870 --> 01:54:28,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1499
01:54:29,835 --> 01:54:31,696
[SPEAKER_13]: I want Speed Racer as a hidden character.

1500
01:54:32,756 --> 01:54:34,797
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a Tatsunoko production thing.

1501
01:54:35,678 --> 01:54:39,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord Katsuhiro in chat says, Tatsunoko vs. Capcom could come to the US.

1502
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:42,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It just depends on who holds what license to which Tatsunoko anime.

1503
01:54:44,063 --> 01:54:45,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Still is going to be a pain in the ass, though.

1504
01:54:45,584 --> 01:54:46,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way.

1505
01:54:48,265 --> 01:54:48,665
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1506
01:54:50,146 --> 01:54:51,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to import it no matter what.

1507
01:54:52,107 --> 01:54:52,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to.

1508
01:54:53,868 --> 01:54:55,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You love Gatchaman and all those other characters.

1509
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:58,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That news does not surprise me one bit.

1510
01:55:00,299 --> 01:55:25,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well if you have been following Core, which is that new downloadable magazine that they have on the PlayStation Network, you'll probably have figured out that if you have purchased the, I want to say the August version of Core, whatever one just came out, you'll actually be able to get into the Resistance 2 beta this September.

1511
01:55:25,997 --> 01:55:26,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And

1512
01:55:27,794 --> 01:55:55,723
[SPEAKER_04]: also there will be some other ways to get in besides that according to MyResistance.net but the best way to get early access involves you pre-ordering the game and they'll make some more announcements regarding that soon but if you want to you can pay $3 for core and not only do you get a demo for the new Naruto game but you get into the Resistance beta huh

1513
01:55:56,905 --> 01:56:00,607
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like this whole pay to get into our beta thing that's been very popular lately.

1514
01:56:01,167 --> 01:56:07,869
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whatever happened to the good old fashions, you know, sign up for it or, you know, it doesn't go out to the public at all.

1515
01:56:07,929 --> 01:56:09,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just friends and family, even that.

1516
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:10,530
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?

1517
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:12,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Pay for demos have been around for a long time.

1518
01:56:12,271 --> 01:56:15,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember when you used to have to buy the PlayStation magazine to get your demo disc?

1519
01:56:15,872 --> 01:56:16,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't mean I like it.

1520
01:56:18,794 --> 01:56:19,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't mean I like it one bit.

1521
01:56:22,566 --> 01:56:25,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you sign up for a core membership?

1522
01:56:25,129 --> 01:56:30,074
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because it's the 60-player multiplayer online, and I didn't really play much of the online multiplayer.

1523
01:56:30,174 --> 01:56:33,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I played mainly the single-player campaign, so I'm not interested.

1524
01:56:34,760 --> 01:56:35,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then there you go.

1525
01:56:36,402 --> 01:56:39,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I think we need to give out an award for stupidity.

1526
01:56:44,929 --> 01:56:49,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God it doesn't have to do with any type of mass murder thing this week or anything like that.

1527
01:56:49,130 --> 01:56:50,431
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much easier this week.

1528
01:56:51,051 --> 01:56:55,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to do with a dumb media person, and it's Jane Wells from CNBC.

1529
01:56:55,592 --> 01:56:58,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations, you're the winner of the Stupid Award this week.

1530
01:56:58,993 --> 01:56:59,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why.

1531
01:56:59,754 --> 01:57:06,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because she has gone on to the network and has basically declared that Sony is going to win the console battle.

1532
01:57:09,023 --> 01:57:17,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem if people want to declare that Sony is going to win the console battle as long as they use figures or sales or even history, for God's sake.

1533
01:57:17,988 --> 01:57:18,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1534
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:24,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the reason why she said that Sony is going to win the console war.

1535
01:57:24,892 --> 01:57:26,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because her son said so.

1536
01:57:27,393 --> 01:57:28,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Her 16-year-old son said so.

1537
01:57:29,594 --> 01:57:34,816
[SPEAKER_03]: He was an Xbox 360 fanboy, but then the E3 press conferences happened, and this happened.

1538
01:57:35,176 --> 01:57:38,097
[SPEAKER_03]: He watched the Sony press conference, and the world as we know it changed.

1539
01:57:38,157 --> 01:57:49,241
[SPEAKER_03]: After hearing about Metal Gear Solid 4, as well as other PlayStation exclusives in the pipeline, and the awesomeness of Blu-ray, he promptly packed up his Xbox 360 and all his games and went down to GameStop to trade them in.

1540
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:53,982
[SPEAKER_03]: As we left the store, I said to him, I never thought I'd see you with a PlayStation.

1541
01:57:54,422 --> 01:57:55,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither did I, he replied.

1542
01:57:56,857 --> 01:58:03,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to mention that they said that he was also ahead of all the industry trends and stuff like that, that he kept on top of all the...

1543
01:58:06,243 --> 01:58:13,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I like how he was just finding out about Metal Gear Solid 4 weeks after it had already come out.

1544
01:58:14,826 --> 01:58:19,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem with a 16-year-old and his opinion.

1545
01:58:20,228 --> 01:58:26,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a problem with his mother being in a position of mass media reporting it as fact.

1546
01:58:27,411 --> 01:58:33,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it wasn't that he thought they were going to win the war, that they already had won the console war.

1547
01:58:34,213 --> 01:58:34,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1548
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:35,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, it's retarded.

1549
01:58:36,952 --> 01:58:40,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, yeah, shouldn't be reported on CNBC.

1550
01:58:40,675 --> 01:58:43,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Financial Investor Network.

1551
01:58:43,897 --> 01:58:45,098
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem I have with it.

1552
01:58:45,899 --> 01:58:50,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whole thing sounds like a big old I-wanted-PSP-for-Christmas thing.

1553
01:58:53,364 --> 01:58:58,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you listen to this show for any length of time, then you will know what segment is coming up next.

1554
01:59:15,545 --> 01:59:18,269
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to say F you to whatever

1555
01:59:20,809 --> 01:59:25,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, whatever has caused my grandmom's current medical condition, my grandmom is in the hospital right now.

1556
01:59:27,172 --> 01:59:30,033
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nothing, I guess, really life-threatening or anything like that.

1557
01:59:30,153 --> 01:59:33,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it made her really sick, but I'm really, really worried about her.

1558
01:59:34,395 --> 01:59:47,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wish I knew what caused something like that so that maybe it could be prevented, you know, and other people... And my mom's had some of the same problems, so it's quite likely that I might later on, so...

1559
01:59:48,101 --> 01:59:48,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Logi!

1560
02:00:10,611 --> 02:00:15,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I feed the people at movie theaters, especially the ultra ghetto people.

1561
02:00:15,474 --> 02:00:18,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the ones that are like, do you have a cell phone I can use?

1562
02:00:18,716 --> 02:00:19,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no.

1563
02:00:20,637 --> 02:00:22,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't own a cell phone at all.

1564
02:00:23,956 --> 02:00:24,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the fuck off.

1565
02:00:25,797 --> 02:00:26,077
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1566
02:00:46,499 --> 02:00:47,660
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to that

1567
02:01:11,741 --> 02:01:15,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, let's try to get back into some happier news in the gaming news.

1568
02:01:16,026 --> 02:01:17,387
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what you got for us?

1569
02:01:17,447 --> 02:01:17,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Come next.

1570
02:01:18,648 --> 02:01:20,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, just some stuff.

1571
02:01:21,431 --> 02:01:22,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, I like stuff.

1572
02:01:24,394 --> 02:01:29,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, do you know our good friends at Overclocked?

1573
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:30,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1574
02:01:31,514 --> 02:01:53,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, it seems that some of the people behind Overclock Remixes are actually going to be, and this is just going to give me a second because for some reason my laptop decided to freeze, but some of the tracks are actually, from what I understand, going to be in Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo HD Remix.

1575
02:01:54,795 --> 02:01:56,356
[SPEAKER_13]: At least as far as I can see on here.

1576
02:01:57,457 --> 02:01:58,858
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's pretty cool.

1577
02:01:58,938 --> 02:02:04,942
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to be having some of the more famous ones on there actually work on the remixes.

1578
02:02:05,283 --> 02:02:05,923
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Pretzel.

1579
02:02:06,684 --> 02:02:08,405
[SPEAKER_13]: We've actually had a few of the stuff on here.

1580
02:02:09,185 --> 02:02:11,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Lion Tamer, Zircon, Shale Riley.

1581
02:02:11,947 --> 02:02:17,191
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I don't see a nickname for him.

1582
02:02:17,211 --> 02:02:18,152
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that's pretty cool.

1583
02:02:18,412 --> 02:02:21,254
[SPEAKER_13]: They're actually turning to the fan community to contribute to the...

1584
02:02:22,837 --> 02:02:24,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, that is pretty cool.

1585
02:02:24,879 --> 02:02:25,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Kudos to Capcom.

1586
02:02:25,919 --> 02:02:27,280
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing a lot of stuff right this year.

1587
02:02:28,161 --> 02:02:28,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

1588
02:02:29,121 --> 02:02:30,082
[SPEAKER_03]: They figured it out.

1589
02:02:32,063 --> 02:02:35,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, something else that's going to be going on here pretty soon.

1590
02:02:36,647 --> 02:02:47,154
[SPEAKER_04]: You may remember Telltale, the company that still hasn't released the Strong Bad game that was supposed to be out this month.

1591
02:02:48,499 --> 02:02:48,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

1592
02:02:48,920 --> 02:02:51,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now, what if it's Nintendo holding on to it?

1593
02:02:51,182 --> 02:02:52,564
[SPEAKER_03]: What if it's Nintendo's fault?

1594
02:02:52,704 --> 02:02:54,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait, you're talking about Nintendo's never at fault.

1595
02:02:54,686 --> 02:02:55,747
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just lies.

1596
02:02:55,767 --> 02:02:56,328
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I thought.

1597
02:02:58,021 --> 02:03:06,966
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are actually putting out a Wallace and Gromit episodic game called Wallace and Gromit's Grand Adventures.

1598
02:03:07,787 --> 02:03:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And players, of course, will be able to control both animated characters, and hilarity will ensue from there.

1599
02:03:15,571 --> 02:03:25,177
[SPEAKER_04]: No sort of release dates were given or anything like that, but kind of imagine what a Wallace and Gromit game would be like, very similar to the animated series.

1600
02:03:25,237 --> 02:03:26,278
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

1601
02:03:27,372 --> 02:03:29,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Episodic Gaming's The Wave of the Future

1602
02:03:54,552 --> 02:04:00,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you're a Scrabulous player, but the smack has been brought down on Scrabulous finally.

1603
02:04:00,416 --> 02:04:06,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Hasbro, the company behind Scrabble, they have decided to place the smack down on the Scrabulous Facebook game.

1604
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:15,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently a request was already put in by Hasbro some time ago to pull the game, and it was not responded to, and that was back in January.

1605
02:04:15,946 --> 02:04:19,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So Hasbro has filed an infringement suit on Scrabulous.

1606
02:04:19,628 --> 02:04:20,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook, Pogo, iPod, iPhone

1607
02:04:38,766 --> 02:04:39,386
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1608
02:04:58,854 --> 02:04:59,134
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

1609
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: The Skype line is now open for business.

1610
02:05:44,175 --> 02:05:44,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1611
02:05:45,016 --> 02:05:45,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1612
02:05:46,337 --> 02:05:47,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's Lord Katsuhito.

1613
02:05:48,519 --> 02:05:49,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it now?

1614
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you changed your name tonight?

1615
02:05:51,943 --> 02:05:54,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you referring to that in the Geni sense?

1616
02:05:55,586 --> 02:05:56,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1617
02:05:57,228 --> 02:06:00,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Do not start singing the Bo-Grom song.

1618
02:06:00,091 --> 02:06:02,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Ranma, you already had an email read tonight.

1619
02:06:02,313 --> 02:06:03,534
[SPEAKER_03]: This phone call better be good.

1620
02:06:03,574 --> 02:06:03,955
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

1621
02:06:04,795 --> 02:06:06,916
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to talk about Fat Princess.

1622
02:06:07,316 --> 02:06:09,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to discuss this game.

1623
02:06:09,576 --> 02:06:10,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Please do.

1624
02:06:10,637 --> 02:06:13,498
[SPEAKER_15]: That alone makes me want to drop the $400 for a PlayStation 3.

1625
02:06:13,678 --> 02:06:14,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1626
02:06:14,778 --> 02:06:15,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

1627
02:06:16,218 --> 02:06:17,459
[SPEAKER_15]: The game looks fun.

1628
02:06:17,699 --> 02:06:18,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1629
02:06:18,779 --> 02:06:19,859
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks fun.

1630
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:27,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I've spent money on frivolous things, but that would be the most expensive frivolous item I've ever purchased just for one silly little game.

1631
02:06:27,502 --> 02:06:30,723
[SPEAKER_15]: And these feminists need to sit down and shut the fuck up.

1632
02:06:30,843 --> 02:06:31,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, really.

1633
02:06:33,581 --> 02:06:41,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think people are going a little overboard with it, but, you know, I don't know if I would buy a PS3 over this game, that's for sure.

1634
02:06:41,663 --> 02:06:45,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, then again, Geometry Wars was a big reason why I got an Xbox 360.

1635
02:06:45,424 --> 02:06:47,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the sole reason, but a big reason.

1636
02:06:47,424 --> 02:06:49,485
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say Xbox Live in general was.

1637
02:06:50,725 --> 02:06:57,087
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good thing you said that, because I have to go get that game too, but let me say my quick point about Fat Princess and I'll be on my way.

1638
02:06:57,147 --> 02:06:57,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, go for it.

1639
02:06:58,442 --> 02:07:02,683
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to see Link save a shapelier princess one of these times.

1640
02:07:02,724 --> 02:07:03,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1641
02:07:03,304 --> 02:07:03,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1642
02:07:28,635 --> 02:07:29,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, get over it!

1643
02:07:52,276 --> 02:07:53,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never going to stop playing games.

1644
02:07:54,318 --> 02:07:57,541
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't mean I don't have my I would like twos.

1645
02:07:58,281 --> 02:07:59,682
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll still play Fat Princess.

1646
02:08:01,944 --> 02:08:03,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, any other thoughts, Ranma?

1647
02:08:04,827 --> 02:08:05,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stop believing.

1648
02:08:06,128 --> 02:08:07,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll hold on to that feeling, my friend.

1649
02:08:08,089 --> 02:08:13,754
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio is the place to be.

1650
02:08:15,416 --> 02:08:15,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1651
02:08:17,662 --> 02:08:18,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1652
02:08:18,862 --> 02:08:19,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments in chat.

1653
02:08:19,643 --> 02:08:23,364
[SPEAKER_03]: GS68 says, we need more Filipinos in games like Talim from Soul Calibur.

1654
02:08:25,385 --> 02:08:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Frisbee said, good God, it's a freaking joke.

1655
02:08:27,405 --> 02:08:27,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Let it be.

1656
02:08:29,806 --> 02:08:39,530
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's the whole problem is that whenever anything happens, someone's going to stomp their little foot and roll their eyes and go, I don't like it.

1657
02:08:39,610 --> 02:08:40,590
[SPEAKER_13]: This offends me.

1658
02:08:40,710 --> 02:08:41,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, bitch.

1659
02:08:41,690 --> 02:08:42,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it.

1660
02:08:42,231 --> 02:08:42,911
[SPEAKER_03]: This offends me.

1661
02:08:44,247 --> 02:08:51,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously though, I mean, can't people just learn to be easygoing and go with the goddamn flow?

1662
02:08:52,492 --> 02:09:00,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, and I know I'm stubborn about a lot of things, but I really, really am trying to be a lot more fluid in how I react to certain things.

1663
02:09:00,536 --> 02:09:02,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Fluid and flexible, that's what my boss says at work.

1664
02:09:02,718 --> 02:09:03,458
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thing.

1665
02:09:03,518 --> 02:09:07,560
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if people, there's going to be shit out there that you don't like.

1666
02:09:08,221 --> 02:09:09,882
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have to have a hissy.

1667
02:09:11,808 --> 02:09:13,669
[SPEAKER_13]: Just say, I don't like this.

1668
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:15,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And then get over it.

1669
02:09:16,171 --> 02:09:19,133
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, freaking build a bridge and burn it or something.

1670
02:09:19,173 --> 02:09:19,553
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1671
02:09:21,234 --> 02:09:22,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Some comments in chat.

1672
02:09:22,214 --> 02:09:26,897
[SPEAKER_03]: SSJ100Matt says, Maybe if Peach would fatten up, she wouldn't always be in other castles.

1673
02:09:27,077 --> 02:09:28,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you think she wears that dress?

1674
02:09:28,878 --> 02:09:30,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran, it's a slimming dress.

1675
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:34,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Shaoran says, We need more short people in games, like Talim from Soul Calibur.

1676
02:09:36,363 --> 02:09:37,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1677
02:09:37,443 --> 02:09:37,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1678
02:09:38,944 --> 02:09:39,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Nah, it's Legend of Zalkin.

1679
02:09:40,296 --> 02:09:41,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind?

1680
02:09:43,057 --> 02:09:46,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing much, just recovering from yesterday's drinking party and all.

1681
02:09:47,158 --> 02:09:48,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday's what party?

1682
02:09:49,219 --> 02:09:54,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, I just went to this party yesterday with just like, you know, massive rock band, lots of booze.

1683
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:57,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just about to ask, was there rock band at the party?

1684
02:09:57,461 --> 02:09:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you don't have a party without rock band.

1685
02:09:59,562 --> 02:10:01,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, then it officially was a party.

1686
02:10:01,982 --> 02:10:05,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I went to a party yesterday too, but they didn't have rock band.

1687
02:10:05,983 --> 02:10:07,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And I left after an hour and a half.

1688
02:10:07,944 --> 02:10:11,646
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will tell you what they had was some delicious lumpia.

1689
02:10:12,027 --> 02:10:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And that got me to stay as long as I did.

1690
02:10:14,408 --> 02:10:15,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Because lumpia, good stuff.

1691
02:10:16,389 --> 02:10:17,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, Zaku.

1692
02:10:17,570 --> 02:10:18,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you didn't call in to talk about food.

1693
02:10:19,692 --> 02:10:21,653
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you want to ask or tell us about tonight?

1694
02:10:22,553 --> 02:10:23,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me see.

1695
02:10:23,734 --> 02:10:25,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to think right now.

1696
02:10:26,116 --> 02:10:37,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact of the matter that Street Fighter 4 and the state of the arcades in this country, the fact that people are going to have to go out of their way to just import the machines.

1697
02:10:39,468 --> 02:10:49,171
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, we already knew what was going to happen because Capcom doesn't see any reason, any justification to give a damn about our scene anymore.

1698
02:10:49,851 --> 02:10:55,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we reported on an arcade game earlier tonight, the Castlevania game from Konami and, you know, they have that Silent Hill thing too.

1699
02:10:55,453 --> 02:10:57,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is Konami a little more forgiven?

1700
02:10:57,274 --> 02:10:59,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And DDR, of course, are they a little more forgiven?

1701
02:10:59,434 --> 02:11:00,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's DDR.

1702
02:11:00,355 --> 02:11:01,235
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an exception.

1703
02:11:02,715 --> 02:11:07,937
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking about, you know, Street Fighter was pretty much born in the arcades and then all of a sudden, you know,

1704
02:11:09,082 --> 02:11:10,122
[SPEAKER_07]: especially in America.

1705
02:11:11,863 --> 02:11:16,785
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, American arcades pretty much gave Street Fighter the limelight it deserved.

1706
02:11:17,405 --> 02:11:22,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, true statement, because Street Fighter 2, I remember playing that puppy the first time in the arcades.

1707
02:11:22,827 --> 02:11:25,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big freaking deal when that came out on Super Nintendo.

1708
02:11:25,608 --> 02:11:28,289
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a $70 game, which, you know, 10 years ago was huge.

1709
02:11:28,890 --> 02:11:29,730
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years ago, even.

1710
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:37,633
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that they turned, you know, they basically turned their backs on the whole scene instead of, you know, making efforts to, like, help

1711
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:46,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of just beating around the bush and saying, oh, too bad, because the numbers are low, we're going to keep it in Japan only.

1712
02:11:47,971 --> 02:11:53,313
[SPEAKER_03]: How come these arcade companies don't more often get into making their own arcades?

1713
02:11:53,353 --> 02:11:58,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know Namco had a thing, but you don't see Konami or Capcom or a lot of other places with their own arcades.

1714
02:11:59,495 --> 02:11:59,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder why not.

1715
02:12:00,035 --> 02:12:01,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, think about it.

1716
02:12:01,275 --> 02:12:01,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a risk.

1717
02:12:02,256 --> 02:12:09,998
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the current state of the economy right now and how gas is ridiculously expensive.

1718
02:12:10,058 --> 02:12:12,399
[SPEAKER_07]: People are trying to save as much money as possible.

1719
02:12:12,979 --> 02:12:13,179
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1720
02:12:14,253 --> 02:12:18,695
[SPEAKER_07]: The first thing to go in tough times like these is entertainment.

1721
02:12:19,556 --> 02:12:20,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I can see that.

1722
02:12:22,437 --> 02:12:29,901
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that the consoles have pretty much given regular Americans a reason to stay at home instead of go out.

1723
02:12:30,481 --> 02:12:32,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're outdoing the graphics.

1724
02:12:35,044 --> 02:12:35,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I can see that.

1725
02:12:37,365 --> 02:12:37,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

1726
02:12:38,005 --> 02:12:39,306
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the answer is?

1727
02:12:39,386 --> 02:12:41,847
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you think arcades will make a recovery, if ever?

1728
02:12:41,907 --> 02:12:42,568
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it going to take?

1729
02:12:43,351 --> 02:12:48,673
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes effort, I mean, like the old saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

1730
02:12:49,633 --> 02:12:51,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good saying.

1731
02:12:51,134 --> 02:12:58,177
[SPEAKER_07]: It's effort on, you know, on those parts, on whoever's still releasing arcade games, Capcom, Konami, you know, the others.

1732
02:12:59,097 --> 02:13:07,840
[SPEAKER_07]: They really have to, like, you know, if they want to make money, they're going to have to invest warrants, you know, into many of these smaller arcades.

1733
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:10,201
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones that are struggling just to get by.

1734
02:13:10,221 --> 02:13:12,542
[SPEAKER_07]: At least help them out a little bit.

1735
02:13:13,126 --> 02:13:15,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Zaku, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

1736
02:13:17,470 --> 02:13:36,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, let me see, yeah, Fat Princess is probably another, you know, matter of fact, the whole Final Fantasy 13, 360 thing, get over it, it's done, it's multi-platform, it's like, it's not going to make a difference.

1737
02:13:38,904 --> 02:13:42,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about the listeners, but we're all over it here in studio.

1738
02:13:43,025 --> 02:13:44,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's like old news.

1739
02:13:44,225 --> 02:13:44,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of that.

1740
02:13:45,006 --> 02:13:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have brought it yesterday.

1741
02:13:46,066 --> 02:13:46,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright.

1742
02:13:47,186 --> 02:13:48,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have to beat a dead horse.

1743
02:13:48,526 --> 02:13:48,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alright.

1744
02:13:49,306 --> 02:13:50,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to remind it it's dead.

1745
02:13:50,787 --> 02:13:52,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.

1746
02:13:52,307 --> 02:13:52,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

1747
02:13:53,947 --> 02:13:54,307
Bye.

1748
02:13:54,508 --> 02:13:58,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1749
02:13:59,309 --> 02:14:01,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's New York night on the Skype line.

1750
02:14:01,109 --> 02:14:02,509
[SPEAKER_03]: That was two New Yorkers in a row.

1751
02:14:02,809 --> 02:14:03,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1752
02:14:03,209 --> 02:14:04,250
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been to New York in a while.

1753
02:14:04,290 --> 02:14:05,030
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been at least a year.

1754
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:05,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for me to go back.

1755
02:14:06,784 --> 02:14:08,406
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been about 12 years for me.

1756
02:14:08,466 --> 02:14:08,986
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go.

1757
02:14:09,226 --> 02:14:11,208
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to storm the big city.

1758
02:14:11,829 --> 02:14:12,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Be fun.

1759
02:14:12,409 --> 02:14:13,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally storm through it.

1760
02:14:13,931 --> 02:14:16,213
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as $500 falls in my lap, I'm on it.

1761
02:14:16,833 --> 02:14:19,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to find a convention of some sort as an excuse to go out there.

1762
02:14:19,696 --> 02:14:20,016
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1763
02:14:20,116 --> 02:14:20,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday.

1764
02:14:21,157 --> 02:14:25,762
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or use name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1765
02:14:26,122 --> 02:14:29,225
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get into some last minute stories here very, very soon.

1766
02:14:29,865 --> 02:14:30,846
[SPEAKER_03]: But first, some more calls.

1767
02:14:30,926 --> 02:14:31,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1768
02:14:31,907 --> 02:14:32,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

1769
02:14:33,587 --> 02:14:36,868
[SPEAKER_00]: It's GS68, and I just broke the streak of New York gamers.

1770
02:14:36,988 --> 02:14:38,089
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not from New York.

1771
02:14:38,189 --> 02:14:38,729
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what's up?

1772
02:14:40,510 --> 02:14:44,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Zach was bringing up the arcade scene and how there are ways to improve it.

1773
02:14:44,731 --> 02:14:53,555
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to do that would be to lower game prices, because these days, what typical gamer would pay more than $0.25 or $0.50 to play an arcade game?

1774
02:14:54,855 --> 02:15:01,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's because those cabinets cost so dang much, but isn't it because of all the fancy TVs and fancy things they put in there that make those things be so expensive?

1775
02:15:02,489 --> 02:15:11,816
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose, I mean, as much in... I hate to bring up Initial D again, but the only cabs they have right now are those widescreen cabs.

1776
02:15:11,916 --> 02:15:16,279
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it wouldn't hurt to make a budget cab with just a regular TV, you know?

1777
02:15:16,439 --> 02:15:21,223
[SPEAKER_03]: But then everybody would know it's a budget cab, and people would go, this one's lame, it's not as good as the other one.

1778
02:15:21,543 --> 02:15:22,824
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what an awesome cab was?

1779
02:15:22,844 --> 02:15:24,065
[SPEAKER_03]: It was F-Zero AX.

1780
02:15:24,085 --> 02:15:25,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a brilliant cabinet.

1781
02:15:25,746 --> 02:15:26,667
[SPEAKER_03]: That was so fun.

1782
02:15:27,107 --> 02:15:28,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but look at Time Crisis 4.

1783
02:15:28,808 --> 02:15:30,510
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the cab...

1784
02:15:32,651 --> 02:15:39,034
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

1785
02:15:39,314 --> 02:15:53,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just because maybe, you know, why would I play 50 cents to play it on the little HD cab when I could, you know, just spend the 60 bucks and get the game at home and play it as much as I want on my high def 50 inch Uber TV of doom?

1786
02:15:54,361 --> 02:15:54,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And then

1787
02:15:56,189 --> 02:15:56,569
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?

1788
02:15:56,629 --> 02:16:03,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, arcade games used to be bigger and more adept than console games, like in the 70s and 80s.

1789
02:16:04,232 --> 02:16:05,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's the other way around.

1790
02:16:05,913 --> 02:16:13,096
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, can you imagine playing on an arcade system for like five hours at a time or something like that?

1791
02:16:14,897 --> 02:16:18,318
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they need an arcade game that like punches people in the face.

1792
02:16:18,498 --> 02:16:21,239
[SPEAKER_03]: A really unique experience that you can't get anywhere else.

1793
02:16:21,619 --> 02:16:22,160
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be something.

1794
02:16:22,540 --> 02:16:25,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, finally, a cabinet that actually goes upside down.

1795
02:16:26,377 --> 02:16:26,737
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose.

1796
02:16:26,757 --> 02:16:29,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, GS68, any other thoughts before we let you go?

1797
02:16:29,938 --> 02:16:30,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no.

1798
02:16:54,438 --> 02:16:57,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I have news here about a guy who marathoned like 26 hours and a half playing the drums on Rock Band.

1799
02:17:23,683 --> 02:17:27,544
[SPEAKER_03]: He played rock band drums for 26 and a half hours.

1800
02:17:27,804 --> 02:17:28,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Did his arm fall off?

1801
02:17:30,205 --> 02:17:31,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, not.

1802
02:17:32,345 --> 02:17:32,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1803
02:17:32,705 --> 02:17:33,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he playing on hard mode?

1804
02:17:35,066 --> 02:17:35,966
[SPEAKER_05]: He was playing an expert.

1805
02:17:36,346 --> 02:17:40,148
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually from the Star Hero Farms.

1806
02:17:40,188 --> 02:17:41,348
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a staff member there.

1807
02:17:42,768 --> 02:17:43,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

1808
02:17:43,949 --> 02:17:44,829
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the point?

1809
02:17:44,869 --> 02:17:45,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it charity or what?

1810
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:48,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have fun, basically.

1811
02:17:49,989 --> 02:17:51,810
[SPEAKER_05]: He did something for charity though.

1812
02:17:52,991 --> 02:18:00,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't that, how do you say it, big, because he only got to like $200.

1813
02:18:02,165 --> 02:18:03,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, still, charity's charity.

1814
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:30,990
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1815
02:18:47,276 --> 02:18:53,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Jamie's and in her big game archive, we'll pick games and every hour the listeners can vote on which game we have to play next.

1816
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're like obscure shit.

1817
02:18:55,861 --> 02:18:57,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no Mario, no Zelda.

1818
02:18:57,402 --> 02:18:59,363
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell do you think I have in the vault?

1819
02:18:59,403 --> 02:19:03,686
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play obscure fucking shit from the vault is what we would play all marathon long.

1820
02:19:03,706 --> 02:19:04,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think people would be into that?

1821
02:19:05,907 --> 02:19:06,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that would be cool.

1822
02:19:07,488 --> 02:19:10,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what charity we could raise money for, but we'll figure something out.

1823
02:19:11,210 --> 02:19:13,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I still want to do the idea I've been talking to you.

1824
02:19:14,468 --> 02:19:15,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that too.

1825
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:18,775
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think maybe a marathon might be a good way to kind of kick that off.

1826
02:19:19,296 --> 02:19:20,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to think about it.

1827
02:19:20,318 --> 02:19:23,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for, I would say, if we weren't going to PAX, I would say Labor Day weekend.

1828
02:19:23,603 --> 02:19:25,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Thanksgiving weekend or something.

1829
02:19:25,206 --> 02:19:25,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1830
02:19:25,807 --> 02:19:26,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Just throwing ideas out there.

1831
02:19:26,789 --> 02:19:28,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Some three-day weekend we'll have to see.

1832
02:19:29,468 --> 02:19:56,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Though basically the point of my call, it's because many of the comments on the Kotaku article and many forums, even on the chat on the channel he has, were basically, oh, he plays drag band, oh, cool, like sarcastic, and even making commentaries like, oh, he doesn't play real drums, or, oh, man, he only plays drag band, he doesn't play in a real band.

1833
02:19:57,047 --> 02:19:59,129
[SPEAKER_05]: And it makes me kind of pissed because...

1834
02:19:59,798 --> 02:20:05,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's not the real thing, it takes practice to do that, and even for 26 hours to endure.

1835
02:20:06,705 --> 02:20:10,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Playing Expert, all the songs, even the Download Continent, so...

1836
02:20:11,841 --> 02:20:20,544
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like... I have a piece of advice for those people making comments on Kotaku and those types of... Whatever website ran stories on this and whatever.

1837
02:20:20,884 --> 02:20:24,445
[SPEAKER_03]: My advice to those people, take a good fucking look in the mirror.

1838
02:20:24,765 --> 02:20:32,048
[SPEAKER_03]: You're posting comments on an internet website dedicated to video games slamming on someone's rock band skills.

1839
02:20:32,468 --> 02:20:38,870
[SPEAKER_03]: No one put a gun to your head and told you to click the little comment button and write something making fun of someone playing rock band.

1840
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:42,672
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think you're any better than the guy playing Rock Band, guess what?

1841
02:20:42,792 --> 02:20:43,812
[SPEAKER_03]: You're worse.

1842
02:20:45,933 --> 02:20:46,394
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1843
02:20:46,574 --> 02:20:47,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.

1844
02:20:47,514 --> 02:20:48,135
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.

1845
02:20:48,175 --> 02:20:50,336
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no counter-argument to that.

1846
02:20:50,836 --> 02:20:54,198
[SPEAKER_03]: You are worse than the guy playing Rock Band, which, you know what?

1847
02:20:54,338 --> 02:20:57,939
[SPEAKER_03]: If it makes him happy, I think he... Play it for 48 hours next time.

1848
02:20:57,959 --> 02:20:58,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I support it.

1849
02:21:02,577 --> 02:21:11,707
[SPEAKER_05]: He did say that he may try in December to do that again with all the download content that is going to be released until then.

1850
02:21:13,249 --> 02:21:14,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be cool.

1851
02:21:14,650 --> 02:21:15,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1852
02:21:15,912 --> 02:21:19,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Actdeft, thank you so much for the call and party on with Rock Band.

1853
02:21:21,598 --> 02:21:22,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

1854
02:21:22,339 --> 02:21:23,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

1855
02:21:25,660 --> 02:21:30,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line because it's time for us to get some last minute stories.

1856
02:21:30,967 --> 02:21:32,409
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, by chance, anything?

1857
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:40,800
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one quick one because some folks were telling me about this in chat and I do remember reading about it, but did you hear the rumors and apparently there's even video now apparently

1858
02:21:42,102 --> 02:21:43,243
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1859
02:22:10,259 --> 02:22:10,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, anything for you?

1860
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:14,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have really much of anything.

1861
02:22:15,141 --> 02:22:20,283
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a trailer released for Need for Speed Underground that kind of looks like a movie trailer for The Fast and the Furious.

1862
02:22:21,103 --> 02:22:23,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not Underground, Undercover, my mistake.

1863
02:22:24,684 --> 02:22:25,864
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of interesting.

1864
02:22:26,685 --> 02:22:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn star Tara Patrick has been hired on as a special producer for Saints Row 2.

1865
02:22:31,607 --> 02:22:34,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about stunt casting.

1866
02:22:34,668 --> 02:22:37,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, I just think they want someone with big tits on their cover, so...

1867
02:22:38,889 --> 02:22:39,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I support that fully.

1868
02:22:42,312 --> 02:22:45,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

1869
02:22:46,175 --> 02:22:46,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't care.

1870
02:22:47,797 --> 02:23:00,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Facebreaker is getting a demo on July 31st, and what's kind of cool about it is it'll have the character creator with it, and you can actually share those characters that you create online, and they will also be imported into the full game when you purchase that in September.

1871
02:23:01,088 --> 02:23:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

1872
02:23:05,952 --> 02:23:06,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see...

1873
02:23:09,461 --> 02:23:14,467
[SPEAKER_03]: BlackWolf says, I don't want to pay $70 to get Vader, I'll just pay $60.

1874
02:23:14,527 --> 02:23:15,107
[SPEAKER_03]: K, thanks.

1875
02:23:15,147 --> 02:23:18,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll pay $60, and then maybe the $10, and I'll actually have a lot of people to play online with.

1876
02:23:34,315 --> 02:23:34,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Just messing.

1877
02:23:37,316 --> 02:23:49,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap it up because we are getting out of here for the evening because live, for those of you folks listening live tonight, we're doing a Justin TV unboxing special tonight so that should be fun.

1878
02:23:49,940 --> 02:23:52,501
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, let's go around and get everybody's final thought in studio.

1879
02:23:53,282 --> 02:23:58,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I will start tonight and my final thought is I want a snack.

1880
02:23:58,863 --> 02:24:00,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I want snacky foods.

1881
02:24:00,524 --> 02:24:00,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Yum.

1882
02:24:00,944 --> 02:24:01,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Yogurt.

1883
02:24:01,384 --> 02:24:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I want frozen yogurt.

1884
02:24:02,305 --> 02:24:02,925
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be really good.

1885
02:24:02,945 --> 02:24:03,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, Rob.

1886
02:24:03,806 --> 02:24:04,686
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd sound really good.

1887
02:24:04,746 --> 02:24:05,926
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my final thought, too.

1888
02:24:06,647 --> 02:24:07,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I want frozen yogurt.

1889
02:24:07,567 --> 02:24:08,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go get some.

1890
02:24:08,288 --> 02:24:08,688
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't.

1891
02:24:08,708 --> 02:24:09,268
[SPEAKER_03]: They all close at 9.

1892
02:24:09,548 --> 02:24:10,529
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll screw them.

1893
02:24:10,569 --> 02:24:11,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the grocery store.

1894
02:24:13,690 --> 02:24:15,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I do need to go to the grocery store, though.

1895
02:24:15,151 --> 02:24:15,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought.

1896
02:24:18,252 --> 02:24:18,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1897
02:24:18,612 --> 02:24:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything.

1898
02:24:19,833 --> 02:24:20,173
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1899
02:24:20,353 --> 02:24:20,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1900
02:24:20,633 --> 02:24:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: All our PSPs still being worked on.

1901
02:24:22,654 --> 02:24:24,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have a lot of small things I have to finish.

1902
02:24:25,935 --> 02:24:27,536
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is been working.

1903
02:24:27,556 --> 02:24:29,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working on it quite heavily, so.

1904
02:24:30,158 --> 02:24:30,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon.

1905
02:24:32,929 --> 02:24:36,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for listening to our show and downloading our podcast.

1906
02:24:37,011 --> 02:24:38,552
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.

1907
02:24:39,273 --> 02:24:44,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, all we ask, if you enjoy the show you hear, if you like what you're hearing, we are an independent podcast.

1908
02:24:44,636 --> 02:24:46,597
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not have thousands of marketing dollars.

1909
02:24:46,637 --> 02:24:49,699
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, we have zero dollars to work with.

1910
02:24:49,779 --> 02:24:54,142
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a big magazine backing us or a big gaming website or anything.

1911
02:24:54,182 --> 02:24:57,584
[SPEAKER_03]: We really struggle to connect with viewers like you.

1912
02:24:58,325 --> 02:25:00,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, tell two people you know about the show.

1913
02:25:00,666 --> 02:25:05,827
[SPEAKER_03]: and slowly through word of mouth, Orange Lounge Radio will spread like a bad STD.

1914
02:25:06,467 --> 02:25:09,027
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot nicer to have.

1915
02:25:09,768 --> 02:25:11,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, thank you guys so much for listening to us.

1916
02:25:12,588 --> 02:25:16,109
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you next week with more of what you've come to love here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1917
02:25:16,149 --> 02:25:28,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, if you are listening on the podcast, you want to leave some comments, you can always send us an email, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com or leave us a voicemail, which we still need to catch up on, or post on our website at the forums at orangeloungeradio.com.

1918
02:25:28,431 --> 02:25:28,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then!

1919
02:25:29,571 --> 02:25:33,160
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Rob, she's DarkSakura, he's Loki, and we are Orange Lounge Radio.

1920
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:33,742
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next week.

1921
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:39,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
