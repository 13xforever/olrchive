4
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:22,377
[SPEAKER_13]: And welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:27,761
[SPEAKER_13]: We are live on this 4th of July weekend, except it's actually the 6th of July now, in 2008.

6
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:29,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Did everybody have a good 4th of July weekend?

7
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:30,963
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a lot of people in the studio tonight.

8
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:32,724
[SPEAKER_13]: If you haven't listened to Part 8 yet, we have tons of guests.

9
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:33,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys all have a good 4th of July?

10
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we had a couple encounters, but yeah.

11
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:36,827
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple encounters?

12
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:37,188
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that mean?

13
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:37,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Random encounters.

14
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:38,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Random encounters?

15
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,531
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like you are suddenly attacked by a gray slime?

16
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:46,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just substitute unexpected fireworks.

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yes, good times.

18
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:57,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, 4th of July, you're from New York City, Ranma, so the 4th of July in a cow town like this one is a little different from what you're used to in Brooklyn, right?

19
00:00:58,053 --> 00:00:59,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Not necessarily.

20
00:00:59,214 --> 00:00:59,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

21
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:01,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Even out in Brooklyn, it's very suburbanite.

22
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:05,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Out in New York City, we look forward to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

23
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:06,896
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the big thing.

24
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:10,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Do people go shoot their guns off in the middle of the street for 4th of July?

25
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that's more up in the South Bronx where I used to live.

26
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:15,639
[SPEAKER_13]: You're confusing that with Texas.

27
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,220
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,184
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, we hope everybody had a safe Fourth of July.

30
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:24,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless you're not an American citizen, then I hope you had a good Friday.

31
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:34,875
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to say in a very cryptic fashion that thank God the end of my headache is over, you know, and I can continue on with the work that I have been working on for a few weeks now.

32
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:37,717
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm not mistaken, Loki will be unveiling something big on next week's show.

33
00:01:37,757 --> 00:01:38,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully.

34
00:01:38,157 --> 00:01:38,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully.

35
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:39,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Cross your fingers, cross your toes.

36
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:49,568
[SPEAKER_13]: The funny thing about the 4th of July, though, really quickly, because I went to the extravaganza at DarkSakura's house that she had, stupid me thought, I want to bring something.

37
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to contribute to DarkSakura's thing this year.

38
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:52,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to be a leecher.

39
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,189
[SPEAKER_13]: So I brought fireworks.

40
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:57,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I went out and bought $40 worth of fireworks and brought it to the party.

41
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,311
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, okay, cool.

42
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:03,292
[SPEAKER_13]: And only to be upstaged by all the more awesome illegal fireworks that were present.

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, our neighbor put in money for the legal stuff.

44
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:09,332
[SPEAKER_13]: For the fuck show?

45
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:35,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

46
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:36,464
[SPEAKER_13]: In the garage.

47
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:38,184
[SPEAKER_12]: That wouldn't be right.

48
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:38,565
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it now.

49
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:39,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Do it now.

50
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Our void says now.

51
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:42,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that's going to happen, sir.

52
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:43,847
All right.

53
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:45,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a 6th of July party.

54
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

55
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:46,708
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

56
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:47,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get back to some gaming news.

57
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:48,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, kick it off.

58
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:51,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, no fireworks right now.

59
00:02:51,916 --> 00:03:00,438
[SPEAKER_12]: But we talked a little bit earlier, actually Rob did during his release dates for Japan, that Persona 4 was going to be coming out soon.

60
00:03:00,538 --> 00:03:01,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, guess what?

61
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:07,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Persona 4 is also making its way to North America as well, just not until December 9th.

62
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And that should be pretty awesome.

63
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,141
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was teased on, I think, a new trailer for Persona 4.

64
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:18,862
[SPEAKER_12]: So December 9th is when you can get your Persona 4 on.

65
00:03:22,822 --> 00:03:29,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and it says also that each game will be bundled with the soundtrack CD as well with select music from the game.

66
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:33,068
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are many RPG fans going squee!

67
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it come with a free spirit gun?

68
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's cool, though, that they're still cranking them out for the PlayStation 2, quality games for the PlayStation 2.

69
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:42,413
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just a budget system.

70
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,593
[SPEAKER_13]: They've still got good stuff.

71
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:49,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it's cheaper to develop for, and if they want to jump to the PS3, they'll still sell probably...

72
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,758
[SPEAKER_12]: What they would sell on the PS3 with the PS2?

73
00:03:53,285 --> 00:03:54,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Gs68 calls them fuckworks.

74
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:22,677
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

75
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:48,917
[SPEAKER_13]: and cooler looking, in their words, suave version of the PlayStation 2.

76
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:50,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the interesting thing.

77
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,561
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be coming out in India first and then Europe.

78
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:56,584
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be coming out on October 28th in India.

79
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:57,805
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

80
00:04:57,885 --> 00:04:58,465
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what that means?

81
00:04:58,746 --> 00:04:58,906
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

82
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:03,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Ben Heck will be able to make an even cooler PS2 portable system.

83
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:10,218
[SPEAKER_13]: The Economic Times, who reported this initially, also says there will be no more external AC adapter.

84
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:15,260
[SPEAKER_13]: The price will still be the same, about $162 American, because this is in other countries.

85
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,902
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you mean, no more AC adapter that's external?

86
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:23,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm assuming that means the plug is built right into it, so you don't have to plug in an external adapter now.

87
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,446
[SPEAKER_13]: It's built right into the system, I would imagine.

88
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:26,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Power Supplies

89
00:05:51,601 --> 00:06:02,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in other news, there is a list that was released by Hideo Kojima, who said what his top five favorite games are.

90
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:10,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was actually speaking to a newspaper, Yomiuri Shinbun, and he listed Super Mario Bros.

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,545
[SPEAKER_06]: series, Outer World, and Xevious as being some of the most memorable and influential games.

92
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Portopia, Renzoku Satsu Jinjiken, Metal Gear Solid Super Mario Bros.

93
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:19,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Alba World, Xevious

94
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Hideo Kojima Talks, You Listen

95
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

96
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:56,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, fair enough.

97
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,621
[SPEAKER_06]: That I've bumped into him enough times that I think I should.

98
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

99
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:06,604
[SPEAKER_12]: So, there's some interesting stuff coming out now.

100
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:12,688
[SPEAKER_12]: PlayStation.com, I guess, was hacked according to a security firm's reports.

101
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:22,855
[SPEAKER_12]: The IT security firm Sophos reported that someone has been messing around with the official PlayStation site, the US one.

102
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:33,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess some of the messing around fits in with fake ads on the SingStar and God of War pages.

103
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:39,947
[SPEAKER_12]: And trying to, I guess, I don't know, put viruses or...

104
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:44,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Spyware or something Were they trying to install spyware on people's computer?

105
00:07:44,286 --> 00:07:46,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Were they trying to say, haha, we pwned Sony, or what?

106
00:07:48,008 --> 00:08:08,139
[SPEAKER_12]: It says basically that the bogus pop-ups prompted people that saw them to purchase I guess what turned out to be bogus antivirus software Dope Oh my god, they put Gator on PlayStation.com Wow Apparently though, Sony's already fixed the problem, but you know

107
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,150
[SPEAKER_12]: That still sucks.

108
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:24,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I would say, if there was ever a list, and maybe we'll have to do this as a list list someday, even though it isn't directly video game related, but if there was ever a list of the most evil things to ever hit the internet, like the worst things to ever happen to the internet, Gator would be in the top three.

109
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:27,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Banzai Buddy would be also in the top three.

110
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:29,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't get me started on Banzai Buddy.

111
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:30,058
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube.

112
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,420
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

113
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, this is sad news in the Sony department.

114
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,864
[SPEAKER_13]: You cannot have Kratos in Soul Calibur 4.

115
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:46,208
[SPEAKER_13]: That news was announced one up, actually revealed in their most recent podcast because they've been playing the game.

116
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:47,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Like you bastards.

117
00:08:47,989 --> 00:08:52,912
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually have the game there in studio because certain media people are more special than everybody else.

118
00:08:53,532 --> 00:08:54,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they've got it.

119
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:59,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And they've been playing the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions and no Kratos to be found anywhere.

120
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:02,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless it was some type of last-minute addition, but let's see.

121
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,326
[SPEAKER_13]: If you think a big character like Kratos was going to be in a big game like this, do you think it's something that would be a last-minute addition?

122
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Download content?

123
00:09:09,888 --> 00:09:10,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Possibly.

124
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:12,612
[SPEAKER_13]: That could be, but I don't know.

125
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I still say slim to none are your chances.

126
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:17,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Cratos in Soul Calibur 4

127
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:42,702
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, I know you and Hubby were debating which version of Soul Calibur 4 you were going to get.

128
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you finally come to a consensus?

129
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:44,204
360.

130
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And why is that?

131
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:46,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Online.

132
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live is better.

133
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:50,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

134
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think if Kratos had been in the Sony one, do you think that might have tilted you in the other direction?

135
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:56,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.

136
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:56,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Not at all?

137
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:57,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a Kratos fan?

138
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:58,437
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

139
00:09:58,737 --> 00:10:00,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really, honestly, I don't care.

140
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, fair enough.

141
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:05,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Did anybody check out Soul Calibur on Xbox Live this week?

142
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:07,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't hear anyone mention it during their gaming weeks.

143
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,369
[SPEAKER_13]: I only checked out the demo.

144
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:13,314
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't feel good enough reviewing it based on the demo alone, but it just seemed like the Dreamcast version.

145
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:17,479
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but not that that's bad, because the Dreamcast one was pretty awesome.

146
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,120
[SPEAKER_13]: But there you have it.

147
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:21,044
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.

148
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:38,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Rip it open!

149
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:38,925
[SPEAKER_13]: What do we got?

150
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:46,347
[SPEAKER_06]: We've actually gotten a crap ton, so I'm very sorry for some of the emails that I am not answering.

151
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:51,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get to ones that I haven't really read before, so... Yeah, let's hear from people.

152
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,149
[SPEAKER_13]: No offense to the people who email us all the time.

153
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's hear from people we don't often hear from.

154
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, um...

155
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:07,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR team, my name is Zyman and I live in Sweden.

156
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:10,484
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a first-time writer to the show and I've listened for about three years.

157
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to tell you, you are the best and ask a question.

158
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:20,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I live in a time zone where I can't listen live, so I have to make do with the podcast, which, by the way, is the best podcast on the web.

159
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:21,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Aw.

160
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:23,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, why is Part 2 released so late in the week nowadays?

161
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:28,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get Part 2 until Friday night, and most of the other stuff you talk about by then feels kind of outdated.

162
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:33,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I don't enjoy what you talk about, but is there a reason why it can't be released on Tuesday or Wednesday instead?

163
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:47,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's been kind of my fault recently, because I've just been so busy on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, specifically, because it's kind of in my... the ball's in my court to get that thing released, and with my birthday on the 4th of July, especially these past two weeks, it has just been a madhouse, so I apologize, that's not usually the plan.

164
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,963
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why we don't do it in, uh, well, first off...

165
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,263
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

166
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:17,898
[SPEAKER_13]: 24 to 48 hours out from part A, though, and that's just because that way a lot of RSS audio grabbers will skip a file if you haven't already grabbed it.

167
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:25,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, let's say there's two new shows on the stream, it will only grab the most recent one, and so people miss out on half the show if they're not updating every day.

168
00:12:26,522 --> 00:12:31,125
[SPEAKER_13]: So we try to space it out about 24 to 48 hours to make sure people are getting each and every part.

169
00:12:31,565 --> 00:12:56,061
[SPEAKER_13]: and just so that you have something spread out throughout the week because most game shows release on Sunday, Monday but much fewer of them release on Wednesday, Thursday so that was kind of the whole point about that so that's why we did it that way so sorry it isn't a popular decision but you never know especially with our 300th episode coming up and talk of already changing some other things about the show you never know, it might be one big show in the future we'll see

170
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:59,106
[SPEAKER_13]: We reserve the right to change things as we want.

171
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:03,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also not reading part of this email though because it is directed towards somebody else.

172
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,172
[SPEAKER_06]: This is thank you for an excellent show and take care.

173
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,954
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

174
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:09,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

175
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:15,400
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's from Resimo who I don't think I've read an email from.

176
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,842
[SPEAKER_13]: The name sounds familiar but it's been a while.

177
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, all.

178
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I beat Metal Gear Solid 4 a couple weeks ago.

179
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:22,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone used the word epic to describe the game.

180
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because there's no other word to describe it.

181
00:13:24,662 --> 00:13:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the best games I've ever played.

182
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:26,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

183
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sick of people bitching about games' cutscenes and not talking about how great the actual game is.

184
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,804
[SPEAKER_06]: With so much diversity in the actual gameplay, I find this alarming.

185
00:13:35,424 --> 00:13:37,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to know if any of you actually played it or just watched a bit.

186
00:13:37,805 --> 00:13:38,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to know what you think.

187
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, a couple of questions for Jamie.

188
00:13:40,966 --> 00:13:41,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

189
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:44,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you watch any of the TV channels preceding the game?

190
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:45,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

191
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: They're bizarre.

192
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:52,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and did you see the one where David Hayter experiences the interview from hell?

193
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:54,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you did, fangasm much?

194
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:55,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't watch television.

195
00:13:56,415 --> 00:13:59,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, is it something like you leave the disc in and you see this random Easter egg stuff?

196
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:00,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, I didn't.

197
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:01,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

198
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:02,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

199
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:04,419
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can.

200
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:09,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I thought that the game was very diverse in the things that allowed it.

201
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:14,744
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also, I guess this is up on YouTube, but no, never mind.

202
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:35,722
[SPEAKER_06]: PS, I sent you guys a video months ago with my goddaughter playing my great 1000 mile rally arcade machine since then I've purchased a Street Fighter 2 machine and I'm now eyeing a pinball table I played a lot of pinball in my youth but don't remember many of the machines one of my customers owns a pinball boutique and suggested either a Black Knight or Addams Family machine as the best ever

203
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,302
[SPEAKER_06]: The Black Knight isn't too banged up, but it needs a bit of work.

204
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:40,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Either one will cost me $2,000.

205
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:46,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard you rave about Black Knight pinball, but can't remember you talking about Addams Family one.

206
00:14:46,449 --> 00:14:47,010
[SPEAKER_06]: What says you?

207
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for getting me through this week.

208
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,094
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, there's a Black Knight and a Black Knight 2000.

209
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:54,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's Black Knight 2000, it's worthy.

210
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:56,539
[SPEAKER_06]: But I warn you, the game's a bitch.

211
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:57,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard.

212
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Addams Family is really, really, really fun.

213
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:02,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Adam's Family.

214
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:29,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to find out the user group that my husband goes on and try to get you in touch with his group because Dan started off on a really banged up machine and worked his way up.

215
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,976
[SPEAKER_06]: $2,000 for an Addams Family?

216
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:32,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not bad.

217
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:34,739
[SPEAKER_06]: at least as far as I've heard.

218
00:15:36,119 --> 00:15:37,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, check.

219
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:47,325
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to go ahead and start, you know, investing in rubbers and plastics and, you know, get carnauba wax for the boards.

220
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:48,125
[SPEAKER_13]: What do I use that for?

221
00:15:48,545 --> 00:15:49,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, pinball.

222
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:50,646
[SPEAKER_06]: For the actual boards themselves.

223
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:56,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you've got Goo Gone handy and acid-free stuff because, Rob.

224
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry if I didn't know you were talking about pinball.

225
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,471
[SPEAKER_13]: This would be hilarious.

226
00:16:00,971 --> 00:16:02,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I live in the gutter.

227
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:09,065
[SPEAKER_06]: just email me later anyway

228
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:14,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email, and this actually is somebody different.

229
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:15,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, Dan Shadow here.

230
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:19,053
[SPEAKER_06]: While I was growing up, I had a lot of adventure and puzzle games to play.

231
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:27,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of my favorites were the Monkey Island series, Loom, thank you, Loom is great, King's Quest, Before 3D, Toonstruck, The 7th Guest in the 11th Hour.

232
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:33,735
[SPEAKER_06]: For the most part, those games were just point and clickers, but they all had great dialogue and good puzzles that fit into the gameplay.

233
00:16:34,436 --> 00:16:36,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Insult Swordfighting was the best.

234
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,277
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is a two-parter.

235
00:16:38,377 --> 00:16:43,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from games like Professor Layton and Hotel Dusk, will we ever see a return of the good plain fun adventure game?

236
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:49,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of the greatness of the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour was that they were of a much darker tone.

237
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:50,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever play Phantasmagoria?

238
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did play Phantasmagoria.

239
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:54,047
[SPEAKER_13]: It was awesome.

240
00:16:54,627 --> 00:17:01,332
[SPEAKER_06]: My second question is if we do ever see more adventure games, are they fated to be just childish games that will work for all ages?

241
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:04,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I would love to see another Phantasmagoria.

242
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

243
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven CDs that game was.

244
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,638
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was epic.

245
00:17:07,858 --> 00:17:09,239
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see another Monkey Island.

246
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:21,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Only because the emailer isn't saying it, I would hope to, gosh, you already know about it, but Sam and Max, seriously, if you're not playing it, this game was made for someone like you who loves these old 90s puzzlers.

247
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:26,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And just the cool thing, and I hate sounding like a salesman for this service, but I do like it.

248
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:27,073
[SPEAKER_13]: I honestly do.

249
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:30,976
[SPEAKER_13]: GameTap has all these old school PC games, a lot of the ones you're talking about on there.

250
00:17:31,196 --> 00:17:31,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob.

251
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:31,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is cool.

252
00:17:31,957 --> 00:17:32,157
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

253
00:17:32,397 --> 00:17:33,498
[SPEAKER_13]: You fight like a dairy farmer.

254
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:34,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

255
00:17:35,569 --> 00:17:43,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Justin sent me an email that reminded me that the song I was trying to think of was Lab from 2DX8Style that had the hearty Hadouken.

256
00:17:45,453 --> 00:17:47,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Play some while I'm looking.

257
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to dig it up.

258
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:49,314
[SPEAKER_06]: 8Style, Rob.

259
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:50,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:52,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take me a minute.

261
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:53,395
[SPEAKER_06]: We got an email from Sauce.

262
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:54,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

263
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:58,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Hi, Sois, which is my online nickname of the Saucers.

264
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky, Otherguy, and DJ Ranma guest.

265
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And Drew, if he's there, too.

266
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:16,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing how I know DarkSakura thoroughly enjoyed reading my lengthy multi-paragraph review of the Iron Man video game released by Sony, I thought it only be fair to review another game, Lego Indiana Jones.

267
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:25,888
[SPEAKER_06]: But as to be kind to her vocal cords rather than writing the review up here in this email, I've written it up in my own blog and provided a link to paste in the chat room, which I will in just a moment.

268
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:33,053
[SPEAKER_06]: The journal, though, is marronmarvel.livejournal.com It's M-A-R-R-O-N-Marvel

269
00:18:33,755 --> 00:18:39,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And she will soon be writing for Orange Lounge Radio when we get our new website done, which is the next big task here at Camp OLR.

270
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:42,586
[SPEAKER_06]: This is part of a project I'm working on for the OLR website.

271
00:18:42,626 --> 00:18:43,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Dubiously and aptly named project.

272
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Update the website so more content can be added.

273
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:46,792
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad.

274
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:52,178
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, the review sits on my own blog until Skye and I can get together and work something out.

275
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,140
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura has another dozen or so emails to read.

276
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the great work, OLR.

277
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, your friendly neighborhood sauce.

278
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:21,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Friendly Neighborhood Sauce.

279
00:19:21,903 --> 00:19:22,343
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.

280
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:23,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.

281
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:25,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I love that she's dedicated.

282
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:28,408
[SPEAKER_13]: I need someone like that to keep poking me going website, website, website.

283
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,050
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm really glad there's enthusiastic people.

284
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,332
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't like sharp things.

285
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:33,633
[SPEAKER_13]: No, me no likey.

286
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:37,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you keep poking me, then I'm not going to give you...

287
00:19:45,256 --> 00:19:47,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys and gals, I've been listening to this show for almost four years.

288
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:56,303
[SPEAKER_13]: It is also the first podcast I have ever listened to, but I have never been able to listen live because of school, family, etc.

289
00:20:09,813 --> 00:20:10,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Abandon them all!

290
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:11,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kidding.

291
00:20:31,918 --> 00:20:36,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Love this show and keep up the good work from Taco4Brain, which is my gamer tag, by the way.

292
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:37,601
[SPEAKER_03]: P.S.

293
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:41,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Imagine Babies would have been a lot better with Harpoons, Fire, and Dragon Force.

294
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:46,132
[SPEAKER_13]: This is going to sound so horrible, but I don't know any other way to put it.

295
00:20:46,553 --> 00:20:50,234
[SPEAKER_13]: The sad thing is my list, I don't have a problem giving my gamer tag out because it's on the forums.

296
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:53,055
[SPEAKER_13]: It's green sky, but it's S-K-I-E, all one word.

297
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,936
[SPEAKER_13]: But here's the problem is that my friends list is completely full.

298
00:20:56,476 --> 00:21:01,999
[SPEAKER_13]: And Microsoft does not address the issue about letting us expand our friends list yet.

299
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,160
[SPEAKER_13]: And I try to when new OLR listeners want to be added.

300
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I go in my list and I look for people who haven't signed on in like a week and I'll delete them.

301
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:37,165
[SPEAKER_13]: but the problem is I'm trying to balance I don't want to delete anybody I know offline but I also don't want to make any OLR listeners sad so I'm having to play this really delicate balancing game with the friend list so you can send me a friend request I guess I could delete someone who hasn't signed on in a week but it's tough please don't be hurt if I defriend you or refuse your friend request I'm just full and I'm not even on Xbox that often I'm still waiting on my request

302
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you... Didn't I accept it?

303
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,427
[SPEAKER_13]: It bounced back saying it was full.

304
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:47,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you gotta like call me or text me and say I'm gonna try to add you and then I'll dump somebody who hasn't signed on in a week and then add you.

305
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:48,731
[SPEAKER_13]: How about after the show maybe?

306
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:49,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we'll do that.

307
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:49,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

308
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:50,372
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll do it after the show.

309
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:51,433
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

310
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:52,834
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

311
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,956
[SPEAKER_11]: On the same subject, my WeConnect24 is now working.

312
00:21:56,276 --> 00:21:56,536
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

313
00:21:56,556 --> 00:22:01,599
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you wanna add me... And it's all on the forum because you don't know your friend code I would imagine.

314
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:01,659
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

315
00:22:02,432 --> 00:22:02,672
[SPEAKER_11]: PC Games

316
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:29,943
[SPEAKER_13]: See, FearTheClaw in chat says, Aw, how sad.

317
00:22:30,023 --> 00:22:31,244
[SPEAKER_13]: Sky has too many friends.

318
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:33,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Cry face.

319
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel like I sound like a stuck-up ass when I say that.

320
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:36,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

321
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:36,827
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

322
00:22:37,368 --> 00:22:38,408
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a whore, darling.

323
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:40,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

324
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, you know, I... Okay.

325
00:22:43,632 --> 00:22:44,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Emails, please.

326
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:45,233
[SPEAKER_13]: It is what it is.

327
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:45,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, what?

328
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:50,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to quickly go through some of these and paraphrase them.

329
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:55,340
[SPEAKER_06]: GS68, who introduces himself in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

330
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:12,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to know what happened to the guy who said that geeks and otaku were the only ones who wanted more storage space and said that it's sad that a representative of Nintendo would have to hold to a level of professionalism and didn't.

331
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:16,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you haven't heard from him lately, so that's hopefully a good sign.

332
00:23:17,023 --> 00:23:17,864
[SPEAKER_13]: Thumbs up, Nintendo.

333
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:24,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And wants us to come to Final Mate 2009, which will be a likely.

334
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:26,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Most likely, yeah.

335
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:27,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Outlook good on the Magic 8-Ball.

336
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:33,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And says, this email was brought to you by Sizzler, home of the Endless Salads.

337
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:37,178
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, California Extremes in two weeks, DarkSakura.

338
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:37,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going!

339
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:38,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to trek out there?

340
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:39,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going!

341
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,261
[SPEAKER_13]: You have room in your car for one more?

342
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:41,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

343
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:42,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

344
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:44,343
[SPEAKER_13]: You're only going for the one day, right?

345
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:45,344
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to stay overnight or anything?

346
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't think we're going to stay overnight, but we might go back.

347
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:49,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I might just go for one day.

348
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going to do the Saturday.

349
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I think I'd only be able to stay in the one day.

350
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:54,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think we'll both go on Saturday.

351
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll come with if you don't mind extra room.

352
00:23:56,994 --> 00:23:57,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

353
00:23:57,614 --> 00:23:58,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright!

354
00:23:58,215 --> 00:23:58,836
[SPEAKER_13]: OLR car trip!

355
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:02,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, short email from Saltech.

356
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:13,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR, I was learning if anyone, including chat, knows anything about whether Diablo 3 will be pay-to-play like World of Warcraft or buy the game like Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 anyway, love the show.

357
00:24:13,192 --> 00:24:15,293
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear you like the email address.

358
00:24:15,794 --> 00:24:21,379
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually supposed to be 666% pure evil, but you can't use the percent character in email addresses.

359
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:23,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So it ended up with being what it is now.

360
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:24,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the great work.

361
00:24:24,982 --> 00:24:25,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, periods help.

362
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:32,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So far as I know, and this comes as a Blizzard fan, it's going to be pay once and play.

363
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Just standard Battle.net model.

364
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:34,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

365
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Diablo 2 is the same way.

366
00:24:36,456 --> 00:24:39,678
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if Blizzard were to change it now, they'd just be getting greedy.

367
00:24:40,918 --> 00:24:41,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Bastards.

368
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,039
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't think that's going to be the case.

369
00:24:45,236 --> 00:24:48,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

370
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:11,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So I made my parents take me there with a friend and we were all like, where is it?

371
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,906
[SPEAKER_06]: But just when we were about to give up, my mom was all like, hey, is that it?

372
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,386
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, yes, it is!

373
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So we take a look inside and my parents are all confused because they aren't otaku and it was awesome.

374
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,972
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called Planet Zero and I was so happy I almost cried because they had imported games such as Poppin' Music!

375
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:29,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

376
00:25:30,493 --> 00:25:34,796
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that really, really sucked was the arcade was small, but that's okay.

377
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:35,877
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still cool.

378
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:37,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you for taking the time to read this.

379
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry it's long.

380
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:38,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Lol.

381
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:39,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Your friend, Isabel.

382
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:44,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's signed as Ro.

383
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:46,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Last email.

384
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:48,566
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a long one.

385
00:25:49,307 --> 00:25:49,627
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

386
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:50,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Long email is long.

387
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:55,171
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one is special because of their ISP, which I think is funny.

388
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:57,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say.

389
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:57,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we can't say?

390
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:58,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

391
00:26:00,174 --> 00:26:07,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, it's... I'm pretty sure that the name is pronounced Nige just as a nickname.

392
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:08,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

393
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,723
[SPEAKER_06]: I always think about this one song that has the name of this supermarket chain in the title.

394
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:16,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

395
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:18,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

396
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:19,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Read the email.

397
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:20,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine!

398
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:23,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear OLR...

399
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:32,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I finally had my first sustained encounter with a PSP last week after years of getting my gaming fix on a Nintendo system, and I was very surprised at how much I liked it.

400
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:45,306
[SPEAKER_06]: The public perception of Sony's computer entertainment strategy at the moment generally seems to be one of a company suffering a midterm malaise, much like Nintendo went through after the year of the 16-bit era until the Wii slash DS combo.

401
00:26:46,467 --> 00:27:05,602
[SPEAKER_06]: as you always rightly say it's all about the games and although there were a handful of interesting titles in the PSP it never really grabbed my attention until Crisis Core arrived in Europe as my girlfriend has a PSP I decided to buy the game and give it a go the game itself is very good I have to disagree with Loki's comments a couple episodes back I find it very entertaining

402
00:27:05,962 --> 00:27:11,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of the reason for this, personally, I feel, is because I've been out of the Final Fantasy universe for so long.

403
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:23,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I played Final Fantasy Tactics on GBA, the Credit Crystal Chronicles spin-offs, and the boring Revenant Wings game on the DS, along with some of the mundane remakes, but not any of the console games since Final Fantasy IX.

404
00:27:23,945 --> 00:27:30,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the art style and the more fluid battle mechanics that appears to have replaced the original turn-based system.

405
00:27:31,146 --> 00:27:34,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I also think that the mission structure fits the portability of the PSP.

406
00:27:35,007 --> 00:27:42,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I can pick up the game, play a mission for five minutes whilst in a shop or sitting on the toilet and then can put it down again.

407
00:27:44,094 --> 00:27:46,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you I keep a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the bathroom.

408
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:53,942
[SPEAKER_06]: When I'm ready to spend time with the story, then I can get bogged down in wasting an hour or two, but when I'm ready.

409
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:56,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's not my main point.

410
00:27:56,924 --> 00:28:00,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Accessing the PSP has been like opening a shiny door in my head.

411
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:01,388
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice.

412
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:03,689
[SPEAKER_06]: What a wonderful product.

413
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:07,350
[SPEAKER_06]: With all that functionality, it really is a media center in your pocket.

414
00:28:07,851 --> 00:28:29,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it could be argued that Sony's insistence on turning their game machines into home computers may have been something of a flaw in their strategy, but then this is also the first week that I have been listening to the OLR podcast out in the sunshine on a PSP before catching up on other RSS feeds that I regularly check out on my desktop PC, which I couldn't do on my DS.

415
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,481
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you for making us your first priority this week.

416
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:36,262
[SPEAKER_06]: There are pros and cons to any product in a competitive marketplace.

417
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:42,623
[SPEAKER_06]: The opportunity cost of the next best alternative will always be subjective.

418
00:28:43,083 --> 00:29:01,167
[SPEAKER_06]: However, with Nintendo's seemingly lackluster provision of mature, and by that design I don't necessarily mean M-rated, just intelligent grown-up design versus the likes of Imagine Babies titles, and the lack of desire to provide choice, goodbye freeloader and region-free gaming, the historic...

419
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:26,765
[SPEAKER_06]: the historic poor strategic vision in PAL territories and of course the fact that we are seen to be geeks and otaku I'm starting to feel marginalized by Nintendo who I once championed so much it seems ironic that in the moment of their greatest commercial success I find myself completely disinterested by what they have to offer it may have something to do with my age I'm not going to say

420
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:32,322
[SPEAKER_06]: and my gaming habits but I am or rather have been a loyal customer and I do agree with you and I'm not much older than you.

421
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:51,137
[SPEAKER_06]: My girlfriend, the PSP owner, who fits the historic profile of a traditional European gamer, having been raised on PC and home computer gaming scene in the late 80s and early 90s, rather than foreign consoles, asked Kropotkin for more info, summed it up neatly for me recently.

422
00:29:51,237 --> 00:29:54,000
[SPEAKER_06]: You were once their target market, but not anymore.

423
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it really is that simple.

424
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:08,161
[SPEAKER_06]: What the Nintendo marketing executive said with their vision really is, and I'm fine with that, they're opening up gaming to a broader audience and making it socially acceptable lifestyle activity.

425
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:15,023
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to look at all those unrealistically happy generations of families in their TV commercials to get a sense of that.

426
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:24,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would have thought Granny would ever get so enthused by virtual puppies and Sudoku puzzles whilst bonding with their grandchildren on an expensive nuclear family vacation to an unspecified exotic location?

427
00:30:25,806 --> 00:30:27,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So why am I bothering to say anything at all?

428
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:43,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want Nintendo to know that thanks largely to the production of the must-want titles by their competitors and tepid treatment of their customer base, a personal tipping point has finally been reached.

429
00:30:43,795 --> 00:30:46,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in the market for a PSP Slim and a PS3 now.

430
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:50,798
[SPEAKER_06]: My Wii is gathering dust, my DS gets the occasional play, and I think I'm not alone.

431
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:54,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting quote in there.

432
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:57,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Something about, you were the target audience, but not anymore.

433
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:02,205
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of hurts to hear, but I think your girlfriend's on to something with that.

434
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:03,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Or no, was that his quote, or the girlfriend?

435
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:04,447
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember.

436
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:06,588
[SPEAKER_13]: But whoever said that is definitely on to something.

437
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:08,130
[SPEAKER_13]: So, kind of sad.

438
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:15,335
[SPEAKER_13]: I think something the hardcore gaming fans forget once in a while, like, OMG, Nintendo, how could you screw us over like this?

439
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:20,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it was so much better when it was 8-bit.

440
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not 8-bit anymore.

441
00:31:22,765 --> 00:31:24,286
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're not 13 anymore, you know?

442
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:26,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of something to think about.

443
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:26,967
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the last one I'm reading.

444
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:30,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry for everybody else that I skipped over.

445
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I had a shit ton of emails.

446
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:33,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

447
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,850
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's always next week.

448
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com Yeah, I'm leaving the ones I haven't read as unread.

449
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,494
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe we'll post some on the forums and respond to them there.

450
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:43,894
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.

451
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,241
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

452
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:50,050
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, mailbag at orange.com if you'd like to contribute to DarkSakura's massive emails.

453
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,570
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

454
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,654
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, back to some gaming news, eh, Loki?

455
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:55,157
[SPEAKER_12]: XBOX 360 Pro Model

456
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:38,210
[SPEAKER_12]: A rumor, wink wink nudge nudge, and who knows if it's true, but yeah, I guess we'll just have to wait until E3 to see if it's true.

457
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:43,374
[SPEAKER_13]: But boy, wouldn't E3 be a really good time to announce something like this?

458
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:47,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that would be a very good time to announce something like this.

459
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:49,299
[SPEAKER_13]: E3, Quandary

460
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:19,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, that's really sad.

461
00:33:20,657 --> 00:33:21,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Really sad.

462
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:24,120
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're sure that that wouldn't happen, right?

463
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,201
[SPEAKER_12]: That would never happen.

464
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:26,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Not at all.

465
00:33:28,544 --> 00:33:32,348
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, hey, these Microsoft rumors, they're never true.

466
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:34,684
[SPEAKER_12]: HALO HALO

467
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:00,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing, though.

468
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:05,975
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be Peter Jackson's game, but the interesting thing about it, it will not have the Master Chief in it.

469
00:34:06,936 --> 00:34:10,258
[SPEAKER_13]: So could the Halo franchise survive without Master Chief?

470
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:11,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

471
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:19,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I forgot to mention, too, as part of that story, the 20 gig model is rumored to be phased out with this price drop.

472
00:34:19,384 --> 00:34:26,968
[SPEAKER_12]: You may remember last year, I believe, when the 80 gig came out, they dropped the price of the 60 gig also for the PS3.

473
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:27,889
[SPEAKER_12]: Same type of thing.

474
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:30,694
[SPEAKER_13]: But we would have no idea if that is actually happening.

475
00:34:30,714 --> 00:34:35,615
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we would have absolutely no idea that something like that would actually be happening.

476
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:40,756
[SPEAKER_13]: A question for our guests in the studio since we haven't heard from you in a little bit.

477
00:34:40,816 --> 00:34:43,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Could Halo work without Master Chief?

478
00:34:45,077 --> 00:34:46,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Ask someone who fucking cares.

479
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:50,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, they have Halo Wars and I'm pretty sure Master Chief's not in that.

480
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:51,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

481
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,359
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell a game about Cortana.

482
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,451
[SPEAKER_13]: A game centered around Cortana?

483
00:34:56,491 --> 00:34:57,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, maybe.

484
00:34:58,132 --> 00:34:58,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Getting warmer.

485
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma, any thoughts?

486
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:03,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I could give two shits about Halo, really.

487
00:35:03,736 --> 00:35:04,677
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what would be awesome?

488
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:05,998
[SPEAKER_12]: Red vs. Blue, the game.

489
00:35:06,658 --> 00:35:07,199
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll work.

490
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes, yes.

491
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:10,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Rabble, rabble.

492
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:11,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I would play Sister.

493
00:35:12,142 --> 00:35:17,566
[SPEAKER_13]: They could do a Halo game without Master Chief, but that's like a Halloween movie without Jamie Lee Curtis.

494
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,788
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just destined to not be as good.

495
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:20,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

496
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:21,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

497
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,497
[SPEAKER_14]: That broke me.

498
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:25,198
[SPEAKER_13]: That broke you?

499
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:25,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

500
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:27,519
[SPEAKER_13]: Syntax error.

501
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:30,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be with the Arbiter.

502
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:32,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Who knows?

503
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:33,403
[SPEAKER_13]: E3, we'll find out.

504
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:39,286
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe that Halo would be a franchise Microsoft would just like, go away into the sunset.

505
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:41,147
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be back one way or another.

506
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:41,608
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

507
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:44,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this makes me plenty happy.

508
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:53,337
[SPEAKER_06]: A new zombie smacking minigame game is coming out called The House of the Dead EX.

509
00:35:54,618 --> 00:36:02,183
[SPEAKER_06]: It's zombie love, zombie rock, zombie bowling, zombie whacking, zombie shooting.

510
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:03,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Zombie whacking?

511
00:36:03,404 --> 00:36:04,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, some zombie love.

512
00:36:06,024 --> 00:36:30,619
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's actually I do believe it has a lot to use the guns or this sort of pedal that's on it like in Time Crisis but it's an arcade machine and it's also a really cutesy kind of bizarro cel-shaded anime style it's the cel-shaded sort of like how House of the Dead 3 was but it's just cute

513
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,760
[SPEAKER_06]: House of the Dead 3 House of the Dead EX

514
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:45,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think zombies and cute should ever be in the same sentence.

515
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:47,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you have a not in there.

516
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:50,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

517
00:36:50,871 --> 00:36:54,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And then will Uwe Boll be basing a new movie based on that too?

518
00:36:54,994 --> 00:36:55,174
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

519
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm thinking no.

520
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,058
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Uwe Boll will be a zombie in the game.

521
00:36:59,178 --> 00:36:59,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't go there.

522
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:01,500
[SPEAKER_14]: For the love of God, don't go there.

523
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he should be a boss.

524
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Zombies got talent, says Vandalist in chat.

525
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:09,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're just doing all these zombie things in chat.

526
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,589
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

527
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:36,859
[SPEAKER_12]: is that each episode will be free or be a free download and remain a free download for a 24 hour period.

528
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,648
[SPEAKER_12]: After that, each episode will go into GameTap's archives and be available to download individual for a yet to be determined price.

529
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Where the fuck is Alice, by the way?

530
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:50,513
[SPEAKER_02]: We need an American League game.

531
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:51,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We need Alice.

532
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:53,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that not on GameTap yet?

533
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:55,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not seen Alice on GameTap.

534
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:56,455
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably coming.

535
00:37:56,515 --> 00:38:00,056
[SPEAKER_13]: You can bet that if this game... They're probably waiting until like a month before or something.

536
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:00,997
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

537
00:38:02,037 --> 00:38:13,522
[SPEAKER_12]: So these will all... I guess the first one is going to debut on July 31st and it's going to be called A Boy Learns What Fear Is.

538
00:38:14,122 --> 00:38:14,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my.

539
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:15,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds a little scary.

540
00:38:17,816 --> 00:38:22,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, changing gears here and moving on to something completely different.

541
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:29,832
[SPEAKER_13]: You know when this music plays, the news is not going to be good, folks.

542
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:37,849
[SPEAKER_13]: You heard that when the Sony PlayStation 3 launched, you heard all sorts of crazy shit happen.

543
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:39,950
[SPEAKER_13]: People were getting shot up in line.

544
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,811
[SPEAKER_13]: People were getting the Sony PlayStation 3 stolen from them right out of their hands.

545
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:49,152
[SPEAKER_13]: But now, kids, we have reached the lowest of the low.

546
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:51,432
[SPEAKER_13]: And it didn't even happen in the US.

547
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:53,353
[SPEAKER_13]: It happened in Australia.

548
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:58,451
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought everyone got along in Australia, but no, this is how horrible it is.

549
00:38:58,891 --> 00:39:09,978
[SPEAKER_13]: Zach Tuili, I apologize if I mispronounce that, but Zach Tuili, unfortunately, he has a form of muscular dystrophy, and he is confined in a wheelchair for most of his life.

550
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:13,560
[SPEAKER_13]: He was able to get something from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

551
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,863
[SPEAKER_13]: And Zack opted to get a PlayStation 3 from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which, by the way, is a great charity.

552
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:20,084
[SPEAKER_13]: I've helped raise money for them before.

553
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,164
[SPEAKER_13]: They were a wonderful, wonderful charity.

554
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:21,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing.

555
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:31,231
[SPEAKER_13]: The charity got him the PlayStation 3, got him the games, and this week thieves broke into his home and stole everything.

556
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:34,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Jewelry, appliances, PlayStation 3, and all the games.

557
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:35,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuckers.

558
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe his wish was to be mugged.

559
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:39,739
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so.

560
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is one of those things where I would say this country's going to hell, but unfortunately it didn't happen here.

561
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:47,143
[SPEAKER_13]: This world's going to hell.

562
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations, everybody.

563
00:39:48,624 --> 00:39:50,285
[SPEAKER_14]: But then again, it's Australia.

564
00:39:50,485 --> 00:39:51,806
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't see that coming.

565
00:39:51,946 --> 00:39:52,846
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

566
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:56,928
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of nice people living in the land of upside-downness.

567
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:58,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you don't want to go there.

568
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,710
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you don't go there, girlfriend.

569
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:01,131
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

570
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:09,756
[SPEAKER_13]: So, obviously, that's about 99 different ways of fucked up, and we will count them out for you right now.

571
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Or at least give you our FUs of the week.

572
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:17,600
Oh, this is bad.

573
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:19,061
Here is justice.

574
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:21,483
Here is punishment.

575
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:24,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is... This is fucked up.

576
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:27,026
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

577
00:40:27,046 --> 00:40:27,667
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to the 580s.

578
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:34,324
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um, FU to the asshole.

579
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:35,868
[SPEAKER_06]: No, FU to getting pulled over.

580
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:38,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Snapped.

581
00:40:38,388 --> 00:40:42,390
[SPEAKER_06]: I got pulled over at the Sacramento airport.

582
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:52,294
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I was dead tired, exhausted after having driven most of the day and wandering all over the city, well, all over Chippewa County, and Berkeley, and all this.

583
00:40:52,554 --> 00:40:58,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And we stopped at AM, PM there, and I had to circle back around so I could actually get back there to get some coffee.

584
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:04,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ended up pulling out and going to the Garden Highway and some to the exit on the 5, going, you know,

585
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to find my way out and I got pulled over and my tags need renewing.

586
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:19,472
[SPEAKER_06]: But they wanted to search the trunk and do all this stuff and it turned out it turned out that they were looking for someone.

587
00:41:20,473 --> 00:41:24,396
[SPEAKER_06]: They were asking all of our IDs and checking everything but they left me off with a warning.

588
00:41:24,436 --> 00:41:25,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Were they looking for someone that looks like you?

589
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:27,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Of all things?

590
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:28,199
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

591
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,201
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my evil twin Skippy.

592
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:31,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

593
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:35,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I like how you have an evil twin named Skippy.

594
00:41:35,466 --> 00:41:37,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Skippy Sakura, Dark Skippy.

595
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:38,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Light Sakura.

596
00:41:38,488 --> 00:41:39,409
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Light Sakura.

597
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:40,029
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

598
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:49,796
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, but, uh... Well, you know one of the nicknames for evil Sakura is Hiyakeshita Sakura, which is December.

599
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:52,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Does Skippy have a mustache like evil Spock?

600
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:52,858
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

601
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:53,038
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

602
00:41:53,138 --> 00:41:56,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I'm sorry.

603
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:57,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else, Dark Sakura?

604
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:58,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

605
00:41:58,721 --> 00:41:59,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

606
00:41:59,922 --> 00:42:01,323
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't give me a ticket.

607
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:02,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go.

608
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:11,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we heard a sort of yelling fight at the Chevron station, which was stupid.

609
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:18,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, man, people, if you're going to argue with somebody and talk shit, no one else cares to hear your fucking nonsense.

610
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:23,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Go keep it to yourselves, or talk somewhere like civil human beings.

611
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, that bitch!

612
00:42:27,572 --> 00:42:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, be civil.

613
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:31,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Be mature.

614
00:42:33,448 --> 00:42:34,548
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGuru corrected me.

615
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:36,329
[SPEAKER_13]: EvilSpock had a beard, not a mustache.

616
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:38,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, NerdTrekky.

617
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:38,870
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just kidding.

618
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,190
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so rude.

619
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:42,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, one last thing.

620
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:46,652
[SPEAKER_06]: A semi-F you to the ending of Doctor Who.

621
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:49,693
[SPEAKER_06]: The season ending of Doctor Who.

622
00:42:51,093 --> 00:42:52,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was sort of a cop-out.

623
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:58,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was, as a fangirl, I did have my fangasm, and I'm sorry.

624
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:03,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to look as good as Liz Sladen when I am 60 years old.

625
00:43:03,996 --> 00:43:05,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that woman is gorgeous.

626
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:11,118
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, but it was, it was, it was a bit of happy at the end.

627
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:12,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little copy out-y.

628
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,319
[SPEAKER_06]: A little copy out-y.

629
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:19,381
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm wondering, there's two people who are, no, I don't want to spoil it.

630
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:22,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to spoil it, I'm not gonna just, ahhh!

631
00:43:26,994 --> 00:43:27,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Next!

632
00:43:28,075 --> 00:43:29,116
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, let's see.

633
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:36,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have said FD to programming, but I don't have reason to do that anymore.

634
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:40,525
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to say FD to my car being in the shop still.

635
00:43:41,494 --> 00:44:01,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, the thermostat housing is busted and leaking coolant, so I took it in on the 4th of July, and unfortunately, the dealership was closed, and they were unable to fix it, so now I have to wait for my car to...

636
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:06,555
[SPEAKER_12]: until Monday when the dealership is open because that's the only place that has the park.

637
00:44:07,616 --> 00:44:08,137
[SPEAKER_12]: So that sucks.

638
00:44:09,398 --> 00:44:13,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though I could have driven my car, you know, leaking coolant as I've been doing.

639
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:14,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Might not have been fun.

640
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:19,245
[SPEAKER_12]: It was alright, but, you know, I just want to get it fixed.

641
00:44:19,485 --> 00:44:21,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's keep the FUs moving.

642
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,067
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to make mine quick.

643
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:22,887
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to drama.

644
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:25,309
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to unnecessary drama.

645
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:25,970
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sad.

646
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes me pain in places I didn't know I had.

647
00:44:29,012 --> 00:44:29,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Rama!

648
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:31,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Which rhymes with drama.

649
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:32,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

650
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:33,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma Drama.

651
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,601
[SPEAKER_13]: That should be a podcast you should do.

652
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:36,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma Drama.

653
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:38,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Ranma does not rhyme with drama.

654
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:44,005
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I'm just, in my real ghetto, don't know how to speak thing.

655
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,966
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Drama Llama Rama.

656
00:44:47,006 --> 00:44:48,387
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to let that one slide.

657
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:52,969
[SPEAKER_13]: You should have a podcast where you just talk about drama in the cosplay world.

658
00:44:53,009 --> 00:44:53,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet it's hilarious.

659
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:56,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I do slip some in there from time to time.

660
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:57,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, FU's of the Week.

661
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:57,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I need to stop.

662
00:44:57,952 --> 00:44:58,412
[SPEAKER_13]: FU's of the Week.

663
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:03,897
[SPEAKER_14]: First, F you to people who have made my vacation a living hell that started it off.

664
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:05,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't need to hear from you.

665
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:06,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Leave me alone.

666
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Second, F you to Continental Airlines.

667
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:18,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, my friend will help me out, but still, I don't want to be stuck in Texas for nine hours, okay?

668
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:26,849
[SPEAKER_13]: George Bush, and your luggage went to New Orleans, which sounds so much like Sacramento.

669
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But your luggage did come back from its early Mardi Gras, like Sauce said.

670
00:45:30,892 --> 00:45:35,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but the thing is, when I opened up the bag, there was no tequila, no alcohol, no nothing.

671
00:45:36,196 --> 00:45:36,956
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an evil bag.

672
00:45:36,996 --> 00:45:37,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Or boobs.

673
00:45:37,837 --> 00:45:38,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

674
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:39,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even beads.

675
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:40,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, really.

676
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:44,561
[SPEAKER_12]: All there was was, you know, parts of Hurricane Katrina and...

677
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Boo, too soon.

678
00:45:47,924 --> 00:45:49,066
[SPEAKER_13]: No, dude, no.

679
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:50,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Dark Tetsuya.

680
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck this heat.

681
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:54,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, fuck the heat.

682
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:55,858
[SPEAKER_13]: I am dying too.

683
00:45:57,126 --> 00:45:57,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry.

684
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,428
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta give a nice, loud, hearty, fuck the heat.

685
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:02,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, yeah, fuck this heat.

686
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:03,089
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.

687
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:03,529
[SPEAKER_13]: A little better.

688
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:04,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

689
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll second the fuck you to the heat.

690
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:08,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second the fuck you to drama.

691
00:46:08,772 --> 00:46:13,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to Ubisoft for not making sure that a game works before they push it out the door.

692
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:21,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of, of course, Ghost Recon Assault Warfighter 2, which decides to crash as soon as I load a level.

693
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:26,660
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not being able to drive yet, not being able to learn to drive yet, because of this heat...

694
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:29,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is driving me crazy

695
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:44,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Death, death, blood, shit, and puke.

696
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:44,639
[SPEAKER_13]: And cornflakes.

697
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:34,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, in actual news, I really have to give it to the male population of Canada because there is a study that has come out, a survey actually that Microsoft put out wondering how many, well out of a thousand gamers in Canada, how many of them play naked?

698
00:47:35,862 --> 00:47:37,745
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is something we really needed to know.

699
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:40,408
[SPEAKER_13]: This was scientifically sensitive.

700
00:47:40,428 --> 00:47:41,590
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to know this information.

701
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:44,093
[SPEAKER_06]: 17% of men game naked.

702
00:47:44,373 --> 00:47:47,698
[SPEAKER_06]: And 9% of women game naked.

703
00:47:47,718 --> 00:47:48,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha!

704
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:54,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Like all the time, or just have once in a while?

705
00:47:54,744 --> 00:47:55,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Or like have before?

706
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:59,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, but get plastic wrap for your controller, please.

707
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:02,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's my question.

708
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:07,066
[SPEAKER_13]: They say this about Canadian gamers, but I'm wondering if it's true about American gamers.

709
00:48:07,186 --> 00:48:08,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

710
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:10,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering something here.

711
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:17,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if the people who took the survey counted, say, taking a handheld into the bathroom as gaming naked.

712
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a valid question.

713
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:21,069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a valid question.

714
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:24,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, outside of the handheld in the bathroom, who has ever gamed naked?

715
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:26,151
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, have you ever gamed naked?

716
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:27,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have.

717
00:48:28,132 --> 00:48:28,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you remember what game?

718
00:48:31,012 --> 00:48:32,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, I was running a fever of 103.

719
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:33,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

720
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:35,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably wasn't DDR.

721
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:38,436
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was actually Super Mario 3, I think.

722
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:39,457
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was before that.

723
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:40,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Top Gun.

724
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:41,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually one of the things we talked about in my massage school about working on people's gluteal muscles.

767
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:42,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be afraid.

00:56:12,565 --> 00:56:14,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma S, what did you say?

882
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:15,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it just Ranma now?

883
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:16,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Just Ranma.

884
00:56:16,646 --> 00:56:16,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

885
00:56:17,086 --> 00:56:20,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma, no S. The first game he played was?

886
00:56:20,968 --> 00:56:22,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I said Rez.

887
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:23,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Rez.

888
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:26,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Transfibrators, yes or no?

889
00:56:28,277 --> 00:56:28,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hell yes.

890
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:29,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hell yes.

891
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,719
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

892
00:56:29,959 --> 00:56:30,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I get a hell yeah?

893
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,301
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

894
00:56:31,702 --> 00:56:32,243
[SPEAKER_13]: No comment.

895
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:33,564
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, there it is, Rez.

896
00:56:33,604 --> 00:56:35,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Dark Tetsuya, the first game he played was?

897
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:36,689
[SPEAKER_13]: I also said Rez.

898
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:37,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Rez!

899
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Two people saying Rez in the studio.

900
00:56:39,372 --> 00:56:39,633
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

901
00:56:40,073 --> 00:56:41,635
[SPEAKER_13]: The first game he played was?

902
00:56:41,836 --> 00:56:42,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine Babies.

903
00:56:42,957 --> 00:56:43,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Imagine...

904
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:45,801
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just wrong.

905
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:46,981
[SPEAKER_13]: That's very wrong.

906
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:47,321
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

907
00:56:48,062 --> 00:56:48,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

908
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So 0-0 so far.

909
00:56:50,243 --> 00:56:50,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, GS68.

910
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see if we get a match on Loki.

911
00:56:52,164 --> 00:56:53,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, the first game he played was?

912
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:59,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I said MapleStory because, you know, it's Canada Day, so Maple.

913
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:02,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Boo.

914
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:06,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's that Price is Right losing noise?

915
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:07,693
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

916
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:08,834
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just kidding, Loki.

917
00:57:08,854 --> 00:57:09,274
[SPEAKER_13]: That was funny.

918
00:57:09,715 --> 00:57:10,155
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

919
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:10,775
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.

920
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:11,956
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't say video game.

921
00:57:12,697 --> 00:57:13,759
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I didn't say video game.

922
00:57:13,939 --> 00:57:14,740
[SPEAKER_06]: I said whack-a-mole.

923
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:15,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Whack-a-mole!

924
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:19,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

925
00:57:19,567 --> 00:57:22,872
[SPEAKER_13]: All hail DarkSakura!

926
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:23,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

927
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:27,458
[SPEAKER_13]: You haven't heard my answer yet.

928
00:57:30,168 --> 00:57:33,229
[SPEAKER_13]: So my answer this past Tuesday was Canada Day.

929
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:35,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I say Guitar Hero or Rez?

930
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:35,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Rez.

931
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,471
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Hero or Guardian Legend.

932
00:57:37,491 --> 00:57:37,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

933
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:41,853
[SPEAKER_13]: To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided he would play all his games in the nude for that day.

934
00:57:42,173 --> 00:57:45,614
[SPEAKER_13]: The first game he played was Beatmania.

935
00:57:45,634 --> 00:57:49,416
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my second choice.

936
00:57:49,436 --> 00:57:49,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello.

937
00:57:50,256 --> 00:57:51,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Beatmania.

938
00:57:52,397 --> 00:57:52,817
[SPEAKER_13]: 2DX.

939
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:54,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Right side pride, yo.

940
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:00,923
[SPEAKER_13]: That explains the firm handshake.

941
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, there you have it.

942
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:12,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, GS68, I'm sorry it's still 0-0.

943
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:14,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you ready to match on this next one?

944
00:58:15,508 --> 00:58:15,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

945
00:58:16,108 --> 00:58:17,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, GS68 says yes.

946
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:17,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

947
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:18,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Next question.

948
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:24,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki recently confessed to a big crime.

949
00:58:25,922 --> 00:58:28,863
[SPEAKER_13]: He was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.

950
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:33,184
[SPEAKER_13]: When the police asked him to confess, he confessed.

951
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:34,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did it.

952
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:39,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I hacked PlayStation.com because the website didn't have enough blank.

953
00:58:41,426 --> 00:58:42,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking ding.

954
00:58:44,386 --> 00:58:47,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki hacked PlayStation.com and said, yes, I did it.

955
00:58:47,487 --> 00:58:50,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I hacked PlayStation.com because the website didn't have enough blank.

956
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:51,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding.

957
00:58:51,788 --> 00:58:51,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding.

958
00:58:58,978 --> 00:58:59,799
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still thinking.

959
00:59:00,379 --> 00:59:00,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Dang.

960
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:06,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that doesn't mean I have an answer.

961
00:59:13,602 --> 00:59:14,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I'm going for that one.

962
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:15,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

963
00:59:16,963 --> 00:59:18,063
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like everybody's dinged.

964
00:59:18,123 --> 00:59:20,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I didn't copy-paste the question to Rapid Slasher.

965
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:21,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Shit, he's probably still thinking.

966
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:25,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Badhost, no cookie.

967
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:28,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Please hurry.

968
00:59:30,228 --> 00:59:31,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I'm slow that time.

969
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:33,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, back with the music.

970
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Rapid Slasher, thanks.

971
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki recently confessed to a big crime.

972
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,614
[SPEAKER_13]: He was the one that hacked Playstation.com.

973
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:41,156
[SPEAKER_13]: When the police asked him to confess, he confessed.

974
00:59:41,196 --> 00:59:41,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did it.

975
00:59:42,237 --> 00:59:44,939
[SPEAKER_13]: I hacked Playstation.com because the website didn't have enough.

976
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:47,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we got an answer from Rapid Slasher.

977
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,643
[SPEAKER_13]: So GS68, the website didn't have enough.

978
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:51,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Pylons.

979
00:59:52,525 --> 00:59:53,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Pylons.

980
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:05,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Old standby answer.

981
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:06,080
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, there we go.

982
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,300
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have pylons and tits.

983
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma, the website did not have enough.

984
01:00:11,242 --> 01:00:12,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Prawn.

985
01:00:12,262 --> 01:00:13,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Prawn.

986
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:14,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match with tits.

987
01:00:15,103 --> 01:00:15,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a match with tits.

988
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:17,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Prawn is not tits.

989
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:19,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Prawn is wannabe tits.

990
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:22,086
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, DarkTetsuya, the website didn't have enough.

991
01:00:22,106 --> 01:00:24,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Iraqi suicide baby.

992
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:27,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Iraqi suicide baby, says DarkTetsuya.

993
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:30,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't get the joke, what's the joke?

994
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,128
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a Starcraft joke

995
01:00:46,543 --> 01:00:47,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

996
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:49,266
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that made the over 9,000.

997
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:51,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

998
01:00:51,388 --> 01:00:53,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well shit, that's a match.

999
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:55,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations, GS68 is on the board with a point.

1000
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:56,712
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a match for pylons.

1001
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:59,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Loki, the website did not have enough.

1002
01:00:59,795 --> 01:01:00,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Cleavage.

1003
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Cleavage!

1004
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:03,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a match with tits, judges?

1005
01:01:03,378 --> 01:01:06,881
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because cleavage is the... It's a match!

1006
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:10,224
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say a half point.

1007
01:01:10,684 --> 01:01:12,286
[SPEAKER_13]: A half point for Rapid Slasher.

1008
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:14,230
[SPEAKER_13]: A half point for rapid slasher.

1009
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, as I am the only person in this room that possesses said substance.

1010
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:20,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, there you go.

1011
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:22,456
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, he didn't have enough?

1012
01:01:22,757 --> 01:01:23,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck.

1013
01:01:24,378 --> 01:01:26,219
[SPEAKER_13]: PlayStation.com didn't have enough fuck?

1014
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:29,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1015
01:01:30,943 --> 01:01:33,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Needs meat making.

1016
01:01:33,305 --> 01:01:34,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck about it.

1017
01:01:35,006 --> 01:01:39,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and my answer, the website didn't have enough Iraqi suicide babies.

1018
01:01:40,090 --> 01:01:42,012
[SPEAKER_13]: I also went with the old stand-by OLR joke.

1019
01:01:44,022 --> 01:01:45,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, could have gotten you two points, but there you have it.

1020
01:01:45,963 --> 01:01:50,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, one more question, a chance for Rapid Slasher to take over the lead.

1021
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:51,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you worried, GS68?

1022
01:01:51,827 --> 01:01:52,027
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1023
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:57,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was a no, it was very quiet.

1024
01:01:57,151 --> 01:02:05,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, here we go, question number three, and it's the last one, so your last chance to make a lot of points.

1025
01:02:05,537 --> 01:02:05,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1026
01:02:07,383 --> 01:02:07,463
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn.

1027
01:02:29,298 --> 01:02:29,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding!

1028
01:02:29,418 --> 01:02:29,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding!

1029
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:29,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1030
01:02:29,618 --> 01:02:29,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Ding.

1031
01:02:29,798 --> 01:02:30,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1032
01:02:52,933 --> 01:02:54,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm waiting for Rapid Slash's answer.

1033
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:55,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody in the studio, good to go?

1034
01:02:55,936 --> 01:02:56,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Good?

1035
01:02:56,457 --> 01:02:57,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, everybody in the studio looks good.

1036

[SPEAKER_13]: We're just waiting on our chatter.

1037
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Chatter, if you need help, there's tons of answers in chat right now.

1038
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,682
[SPEAKER_13]: I like some of these answers.

1039
01:03:17,063 --> 01:03:31,353
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, some of the answers we have for the previous one, on the website, website didn't have enough Eye of Judgment, Worthwhile Content, Porn, Hentai, Super Bacon.

1040
01:03:31,914 --> 01:03:34,176
[SPEAKER_13]: Website didn't have enough, that's a good one, that would have been a good one.

1041
01:03:34,656 --> 01:03:39,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and then the other one, the first game I was going to play naked, Captain Commando.

1042
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:42,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Boom Blocks, Texas Hold'em Dick Woman

1043
01:04:07,031 --> 01:04:08,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I said Guinness Woman Guinness Woman

1044
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:35,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Very well done.

1045
01:04:35,283 --> 01:04:35,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Very well done.

1046
01:04:35,783 --> 01:04:36,223
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good one.

1047
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:36,484
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1048
01:04:36,764 --> 01:04:38,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Dark Tetsuya, her name would be?

1049
01:04:38,705 --> 01:04:40,767
[SPEAKER_11]: A bit cliche, but Bionic Woman.

1050
01:04:41,268 --> 01:04:41,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Bionic Woman.

1051
01:04:42,028 --> 01:04:42,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

1052
01:04:42,509 --> 01:04:43,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Her name is Jamie Summers.

1053
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:44,210
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

1054
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:44,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Good answer.

1055
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:45,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Good answer.

1056
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:45,511
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1057
01:04:45,952 --> 01:04:47,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Drew, the name would be?

1058
01:04:47,693 --> 01:04:48,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret Woman.

1059
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:49,555
[SPEAKER_13]: Ferret Woman.

1060
01:04:49,655 --> 01:04:50,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my gosh.

1061
01:04:50,676 --> 01:04:51,276
[SPEAKER_13]: A match.

1062
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:55,379
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, Rapid Slasher takes the lead to one and a half versus one.

1063
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:56,020
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1064
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

1065
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:59,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, the evil robot's name would be?

1066
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:02,846
[SPEAKER_12]: Bitch, get back in the kitchen and make me dinner, woman.

1067
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:05,320
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura

1068
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:27,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, that's great.

1069
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:28,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you hear that on Justin.TV?

1070
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:30,374
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, her name would be?

1071
01:05:30,835 --> 01:05:31,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Woman.

1072
01:05:31,535 --> 01:05:32,815
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't need anything else.

1073
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,256
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you need to know.

1074
01:05:37,197 --> 01:05:38,257
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be pretty evil.

1075
01:05:38,897 --> 01:05:39,037
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1076
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:41,410
[SPEAKER_13]: I got the finger.

1077
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,331
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here it is.

1078
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:43,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Here it is.

1079
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:46,533
[SPEAKER_13]: If I said Dick Woman, then GS68 wins.

1080
01:05:47,174 --> 01:05:52,837
[SPEAKER_13]: My answer, if I made an evil robot, her name would be Sniper Woman.

1081
01:05:53,357 --> 01:06:00,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Sniper Woman, which unfortunately is not a match, which means Rapid Slasher wins in a narrow victory of one and a half to one.

1082
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:04,443
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68, I'm sorry you're the loser tonight.

1083
01:06:05,724 --> 01:06:07,345
[SPEAKER_13]: So is there any final words you have?

1084
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:10,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I am already... Oh, sorry.

1085
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,046
[SPEAKER_13]: You get hung up on because you lost.

1086
01:06:12,686 --> 01:06:13,006
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1087
01:06:13,466 --> 01:06:14,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that's what the losers get.

1088
01:06:14,646 --> 01:06:15,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1089
01:06:15,427 --> 01:06:16,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Pwned.

1090
01:06:16,267 --> 01:06:16,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, come on.

1091
01:06:16,747 --> 01:06:18,668
[SPEAKER_13]: GS68's been on the show a million times.

1092
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:20,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing there.

1093
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:20,968
[SPEAKER_13]: He knows the rules.

1094
01:06:21,188 --> 01:06:26,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Rapid Slasher, if you have anything you want to plug, send me a private message and I will plug it.

1095
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,690
[SPEAKER_13]: As the winner, you get to plug whatever you want.

1096
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:34,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Meanwhile, Loki's going to get to the next story while I assess the damage of the party foul.

1097
01:06:34,732 --> 01:06:40,097
[SPEAKER_12]: There is another rumor of a game coming out now for, I believe, the PSP.

1098
01:06:41,078 --> 01:06:48,325
[SPEAKER_12]: And this would make sense since, well, they've had other similar collections on the PSP as well.

1099
01:06:48,885 --> 01:06:51,168
[SPEAKER_12]: It is the Star Soldier collection.

1100
01:06:51,268 --> 01:06:57,153
[SPEAKER_12]: It's supposed to contain four different Star Soldier games, including Star Soldier.

1101
01:06:58,174 --> 01:06:58,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1102
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:02,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see, Final Soldier and Soldier Blade.

1103
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:07,880
[SPEAKER_12]: And one other one, oh, Superstar Soldier, I guess, as well.

1104
01:07:09,381 --> 01:07:10,181
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of cool.

1105
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:13,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry, and I got this all wrong here.

1106
01:07:13,723 --> 01:07:18,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Superstar Soldier, Final Soldier, Soldier Blade, and Star Parodier.

1107
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:19,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Parodia!

1108
01:07:20,638 --> 01:07:27,582
[SPEAKER_12]: and it would retail, I guess, in Japan for 2,940 yen, which is less than $30 US.

1109
01:07:27,902 --> 01:07:28,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want this.

1110
01:07:29,123 --> 01:07:30,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Parodia is like the best game ever.

1111
01:07:31,344 --> 01:07:34,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't I done Star Parodia on a classic game?

1112
01:07:35,706 --> 01:07:36,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Possibly.

1113
01:07:36,206 --> 01:07:37,887
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you did one form of Parodius or another.

1114
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:38,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it was that specific one.

1115
01:07:38,828 --> 01:07:39,288
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not Parodius.

1116
01:07:39,308 --> 01:07:40,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It has nothing to do with Parodius.

1117
01:07:40,048 --> 01:07:40,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my bad.

1118
01:07:40,449 --> 01:07:42,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Parodia is a parody of Star Soldier.

1119
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:43,390
[SPEAKER_13]: That I don't think you've done.

1120
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:46,672
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all about Star Soldier myself, so do want.

1121
01:07:47,648 --> 01:07:48,008
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1122
01:07:48,729 --> 01:07:49,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds pretty awesome.

1123
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:55,775
[SPEAKER_12]: It's funny, though, because on the little screenshot that they have, or box shot or whatever it is, they have a bunch of the Bombermen guys running around.

1124
01:07:56,856 --> 01:07:57,216
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1125
01:07:57,936 --> 01:08:03,681
[SPEAKER_13]: I never saw Rapid Slasher send something he wanted to plug in private message, so I guess that's that.

1126
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:04,762
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1127
01:08:04,802 --> 01:08:05,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe after this story.

1128
01:08:06,643 --> 01:08:07,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Burnout Paradise.

1129
01:08:07,744 --> 01:08:13,949
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one of those games I played for a couple days, and I was like, eh, I'm over it, which is sad because Burnout was such a fun series.

1130
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:14,370
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know...

1131
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:35,917
[SPEAKER_13]: hats off to the folks at Criterion because they keep trying to invent new ways to make the game more fun granted they had a patch of theirs get pushed back a little bit but guess what's coming for the next patch this is very interesting Criterion is considering after this whole Cagney update is done they're going to put planes in Burnout Paradise yes planes

1132
01:08:36,604 --> 01:08:38,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Like pilot wings, planes.

1133
01:08:39,086 --> 01:08:40,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see an airborne takedown.

1134
01:08:40,927 --> 01:08:45,850
[SPEAKER_13]: That could be very interesting, but I worry about all the fan videos on YouTube.

1135
01:08:45,931 --> 01:08:47,832
[SPEAKER_12]: I want free running to be in there.

1136
01:08:48,272 --> 01:08:52,975
[SPEAKER_12]: I want people just running and then running into other people, and that's what's going to happen.

1137
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,557
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going to explode and crash.

1138
01:08:54,837 --> 01:09:03,503
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say, though, referring to an earlier story in the evening, it would be pretty awesome to fly the plane in Burnout Paradise with a custom soundtrack playing Danger Zone.

1139
01:09:05,305 --> 01:09:05,765
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura

1140
01:09:27,776 --> 01:09:29,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Hells yeah, I am.

1141
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the, I'd have to say, best RPG series ever.

1142
01:09:34,358 --> 01:09:35,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me untangle myself.

1143
01:09:36,278 --> 01:09:37,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not called Let Me Untangle Myself.

1144
01:09:37,699 --> 01:09:39,059
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a pretty fun RPG.

1145
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:41,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Phantasy Star.

1146
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're doing a Phantasy Star Portable.

1147
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,781
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a demo that is actually out.

1148
01:09:50,362 --> 01:09:51,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can find it.

1149
01:09:51,723 --> 01:09:56,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, on the official website, I do believe, at fantasystar.sega.jp slash PSP.

1150
01:09:58,345 --> 01:10:07,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got new characters and some downloadable content, and the demo is going to be out on July 14th, and the game will be out on the 31st, but that is Japan only.

1151
01:10:08,528 --> 01:10:10,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will be 301 megabytes in size.

1152
01:10:12,789 --> 01:10:13,289
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds interesting.

1153
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:13,970
[SPEAKER_06]: The demo, sorry.

1154
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Could be fun.

1155
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be, as they say, an extensive demo.

1156
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:25,045
[SPEAKER_06]: you can access story mode and multi-mode and you can bring your saved data from the demo to the final game

1157
01:10:26,897 --> 01:10:55,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, I got the plugs from Rapid Slasher before we get to tonight's Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR Username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio Rapid Slasher would like to plug his YouTube channel available at youtube.com slash user slash Rapid Slasher And I'm looking at it right now, it looks like he has a two girls one cup reaction video Oh, those are always fun It looks like a friend is watching it on a cell phone there or something So there you have it And a video called Chewbacca, which I can only imagine what that is Stop it

1158
01:10:56,041 --> 01:11:00,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Rabbit Slasher would also like to say, Indiana represent, and go see Radiohead this summer.

1159
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:02,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Radiohead.

1160
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:03,663
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1161
01:11:04,004 --> 01:11:05,444
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know Radiohead was going out on tour.

1162
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: They have an album out.

1163
01:11:07,845 --> 01:11:08,265
[SPEAKER_06]: We might have to.

1164
01:11:08,285 --> 01:11:09,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Rainbow's album.

1165
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:10,526
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, we might have to go do that.

1166
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Radiohead.

1167
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:12,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking that.

1168
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:13,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Except Tom York is nuts.

1169
01:11:13,827 --> 01:11:14,067
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1170
01:11:14,327 --> 01:11:20,229
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, before we get to the Skype line tonight, we have a very special late-breaking report, like live stuff going on right now.

1171
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:23,130
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to our OLR correspondent who's on the line.

1172
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:23,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you there?

1173
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,051
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Tyrant What did you use our name to get into this week?

1174
01:11:49,993 --> 01:11:55,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to Anime Expo, which actually just ended today, and I just got home about an hour ago.

1175
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:59,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to play some games that aren't out yet, got to check out some stuff.

1176
01:11:59,979 --> 01:12:01,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, first question I've got to ask.

1177
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Anime Expo gets a little bit of a bad rap out there in the community.

1178
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never been, so this is not a personal... That's okay, it sucks.

1179
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:13,807
[SPEAKER_13]: But all I've ever heard is it sucks, anime sucks, suckspo, anime, you know.

1180
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it still suck, or do you think people might need to pay at another visit?

1181
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:23,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I think people might need to pay it another visit because they've restructured a lot of the upper people.

1182
01:12:24,151 --> 01:12:24,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Did it suck as bad as last year?

1183
01:12:24,972 --> 01:12:26,373
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems a lot more organized now.

1184
01:12:27,574 --> 01:12:29,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Did it suck as bad as last year, asked DarkSakura.

1185
01:12:30,275 --> 01:12:30,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

1186
01:12:31,076 --> 01:12:32,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It was much improved over last year.

1187
01:12:32,977 --> 01:12:35,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that nothing could suck as badly as last year has ever sucked.

1188
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year was pretty bad.

1189
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:40,323
[SPEAKER_13]: In order to come up, you've got to hit rock bottom first.

1190
01:12:40,483 --> 01:12:42,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go, rock bottom.

1191
01:12:42,784 --> 01:12:47,408
[SPEAKER_02]: How many rabid Odon Host Club fangirls did you have to push your way through to get to the games?

1192
01:12:48,443 --> 01:12:48,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Too many.

1193
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:51,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's talk about games.

1194
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:53,431
[SPEAKER_13]: What type of video game stuff did you see at Anime Expo?

1195
01:12:54,673 --> 01:13:00,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots and lots of fighting games, because that seems to be pretty much 90% of any anime video game.

1196
01:13:01,324 --> 01:13:01,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair enough.

1197
01:13:02,691 --> 01:13:06,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Were they lots of fighting games based on animes, like any particular ones that jump out in your mind?

1198
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, the typical Naruto games.

1199
01:13:09,255 --> 01:13:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Namco had their PS3 Naruto game, and that looked really good.

1200
01:13:13,318 --> 01:13:14,579
[SPEAKER_08]: The graphics were really nice on that.

1201
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:27,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And D3 had their Wii Naruto fighting game, and so that's probably not going to be that great because it's on the Wii, and Wii fighting games generally are not that great.

1202
01:13:27,307 --> 01:13:27,808
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that, Loki?

1203
01:13:27,828 --> 01:13:34,916
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, which, by the way, if you want to play the demo for the PS3 one, you can download the second episode of Core, and they have an exclusive demo in there.

1204
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you subscribed to Core?

1205
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:37,479
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but I read it.

1206
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:39,601
[SPEAKER_12]: I ain't buying demos.

1207
01:13:39,621 --> 01:13:40,142
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell?

1208
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:40,923
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not stupid.

1209
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:41,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Jimmy.

1210
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:42,325
[SPEAKER_13]: What else was there?

1211
01:13:43,509 --> 01:13:52,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to actually Arc System Works panel, which does Guilty Gear, and they showed off a couple trailers for some games that are coming out.

1212
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:58,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Castle Shikigami 3, which is a Wii title, it's another one of those shumps.

1213
01:13:59,592 --> 01:14:04,713
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks really beautiful, and it looks a lot like Hikaruga.

1214
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:07,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like fun.

1215
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:09,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Were there any non-fighting games there, or was that like all you saw?

1216
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,848
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all that was pretty much playable.

1217
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:14,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Soul Calibur 4 was playable.

1218
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,932
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked really, really beautiful.

1219
01:14:18,474 --> 01:14:20,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Street Fighter 4?

1220
01:14:21,397 --> 01:14:22,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Street Fighter 4.

1221
01:14:22,138 --> 01:14:24,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Capcom was not there, so Street Fighter 4 was not there.

1222
01:14:24,741 --> 01:14:25,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, tell us more about Soul Calibur 4.

1223
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get some hands-on play with Soul Calibur 4?

1224
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:28,105
[SPEAKER_13]: How was it?

1225
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:33,641
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I didn't, but it looked pretty much like a standard Soul Calibur game.

1226
01:14:33,661 --> 01:14:36,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there were only three playable characters, none of the exclusives.

1227
01:14:36,903 --> 01:14:39,524
[SPEAKER_08]: No Darth Vader or Yoda or Kratos.

1228
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:40,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1229
01:14:41,365 --> 01:14:41,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Funny.

1230
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1231
01:14:43,761 --> 01:14:48,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one from Arc Systems' work was Battle Fantasia, which I got to spend some time with.

1232
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:51,844
[SPEAKER_08]: It's another fighting game, but it's exclusive for the 360.

1233
01:14:52,204 --> 01:14:57,566
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll have Xbox Live Play coming out, I think, September 16th, they said.

1234
01:14:58,346 --> 01:14:59,247
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a PS3 version.

1235
01:14:59,267 --> 01:15:01,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Very similar to Third Strike in that there's...

1236
01:15:02,408 --> 01:15:03,729
[SPEAKER_08]: A parry system in it.

1237
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:08,150
[SPEAKER_08]: You hit the R1 shoulder button and the next attack is parried.

1238
01:15:09,050 --> 01:15:14,112
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do it and there's no attack, there's kind of a cooldown from when you can attack again.

1239
01:15:14,592 --> 01:15:20,354
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know there is a PS3 version of that because I'm actually trying to get a friend right now who's over in Japan to import it for me.

1240
01:15:20,434 --> 01:15:22,994
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm surprised they're not localizing that.

1241
01:15:23,034 --> 01:15:24,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably a paid exclusive.

1242
01:15:24,715 --> 01:15:26,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that came up a lot during their panel.

1243
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:28,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone was like, are you bringing it over for a PS3?

1244
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:31,017
[SPEAKER_08]: And they haven't made any announcements yet for that.

1245
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:40,442
[SPEAKER_08]: They also showed a trailer for the Phoenix Wright style game, Jack Hunter.

1246
01:15:41,622 --> 01:15:46,663
[SPEAKER_08]: That was kind of funny to see that because it looks almost exactly like Phoenix Wright.

1247
01:15:47,244 --> 01:15:49,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see Blue Blaze Calamity Trigger?

1248
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:53,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw the game and the line was huge for it.

1249
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:57,586
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks very similar to the Guilty Gear XX series.

1250
01:15:58,507 --> 01:16:00,147
[SPEAKER_08]: It has the same style of gameplay.

1251
01:16:01,949 --> 01:16:04,010
[SPEAKER_08]: and there's a blocking system in it.

1252
01:16:05,091 --> 01:16:20,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to check it out and on that top bar, if you've played Street Fighter Alpha 3, there's a guard meter where you can only guard so much and it's separate in that game but in this game, both people share it so I can see some strategies playing out because of that.

1253
01:16:20,906 --> 01:16:26,812
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a little surprised that you didn't see more RPGs, MMOs from little companies and all that kind of stuff.

1254
01:16:26,952 --> 01:16:31,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a ton of the little MMOs, MapleStory.

1255
01:16:32,157 --> 01:16:33,499
[SPEAKER_08]: They got me to sign up for that.

1256
01:16:33,519 --> 01:16:34,560
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check it out.

1257
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucker.

1258
01:16:37,142 --> 01:16:37,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they gave me $10 in free...

1259
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Nickel and Diamond DLC or whatever it is.

1260
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:45,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Was it worth selling your soul?

1261
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't sell my soul yet.

1262
01:16:49,351 --> 01:16:49,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1263
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:50,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Yet.

1264
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:51,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Keyword.

1265
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:51,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1266
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:55,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Jimmy, before we let you go, we gotta know.

1267
01:16:55,114 --> 01:16:58,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for giving us the fill on what we missed on Anime Expo, but I gotta know.

1268
01:16:58,616 --> 01:17:00,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Best cosplay and worst cosplay?

1269
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:02,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

1270
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:03,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

1271
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:09,927
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite cosplay was probably a Captain Falcon that looked pretty darn good.

1272
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:11,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was pretty funny.

1273
01:17:11,407 --> 01:17:11,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

1274
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:12,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero.

1275
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:13,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Worst cosplay?

1276
01:17:14,508 --> 01:17:19,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of the females that really didn't need to be in skimpy outfits?

1277
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:20,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

1278
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,171
[SPEAKER_13]: There you have it.

1279
01:17:22,481 --> 01:17:26,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you have that at every con, though, so I don't know.

1280
01:17:26,062 --> 01:17:27,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not appealing.

1281
01:17:27,923 --> 01:17:29,864
[SPEAKER_08]: David Hader's awesome.

1282
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:32,725
[SPEAKER_14]: I assume that no cosplayer's got shot being in L.A.?

1283
01:17:32,745 --> 01:17:32,845
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1284
01:17:32,865 --> 01:17:34,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm shocked.

1285
01:17:34,686 --> 01:17:36,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why everyone assumes that.

1286
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:40,748
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, DJ Tyrant, I'll see you at BlizzCon.

1287
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:41,608
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a nicer area.

1288
01:17:41,628 --> 01:17:42,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

1289
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:43,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be a blast.

1290
01:17:43,769 --> 01:17:44,089
[SPEAKER_08]: It will.

1291
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:44,849
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1292
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:46,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care, Jimmy.

1293
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:46,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, guys.

1294
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:47,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

1295
01:17:47,771 --> 01:17:48,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for being on the show.

1296
01:17:49,778 --> 01:17:54,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, we like hearing from Jimmy, and I'm glad he has a place to come on and talk, sadly, because STFU is no more.

1297
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:55,740
[SPEAKER_13]: That's sad.

1298
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:11,165
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is, uh, STFU is kind of combined now, you know, you got half of, uh, STFU, you got DMN, and you got, uh, Travis Donovan, they do a show together, here on, uh, All Games Radio, it's Under Station Live, it airs Saturday nights, and it was the show I started on years ago, and DarkSakura was a guest like 50 million times.

1299
01:18:12,085 --> 01:18:12,665
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you have it.

1300
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:16,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, if you want to give us a call, 1-877-GAME-OLR, and it's already ringing.

1301
01:18:16,846 --> 01:18:18,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

1302
01:18:19,383 --> 01:18:21,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this is the other New Yorker, SSJ100Matt.

1303
01:18:21,144 --> 01:18:21,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what's up Matt?

1304
01:18:21,844 --> 01:18:22,404
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

1305
01:18:22,424 --> 01:18:22,944
[SPEAKER_13]: What was that?

1306
01:18:45,134 --> 01:18:45,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Chrono Trigger

1307
01:18:56,274 --> 01:18:57,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Chrono... No, you're right.

1308
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:59,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Not according to me, but I still think it's pretty darn good.

1309
01:18:59,617 --> 01:19:02,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Not even as good as some of the Final Fantasy games I've played, but that's alright.

1310
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Even I will probably get the Chrono Trigger remake on DS.

1311
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:12,026
[SPEAKER_13]: There was this collective explosion of fangasm on the internet this week when that was announced.

1312
01:19:12,066 --> 01:19:12,946
[SPEAKER_13]: That was pretty crazy.

1313
01:19:14,528 --> 01:19:19,271
[SPEAKER_13]: My LiveJournal friends list exploded, and I'm sure people's Twitters blew themselves up as well.

1314
01:19:19,711 --> 01:19:19,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

1315
01:19:20,892 --> 01:19:27,075
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you, as a Chrono Trigger fan, really want to see in this new DS version, Matt?

1316
01:19:28,276 --> 01:19:35,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I assume it's going to be based on the SNES version, but I think just keep everything the way it was.

1317
01:19:36,059 --> 01:19:40,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they said they were going to add more dungeons and online play.

1318
01:19:41,301 --> 01:19:42,002
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine with me.

1319
01:19:43,162 --> 01:19:47,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I beat the game 10,000 times since it's come out, so...

1320
01:19:47,987 --> 01:19:54,608
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you have thought, Matt, if it had turned out that this game was a 3D remake in the same vein as Final Fantasy 3 and Final Fantasy 4?

1321
01:19:54,688 --> 01:19:56,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you have been a little scared or what?

1322
01:19:58,609 --> 01:19:59,970
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably would have been a little scared.

1323
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably still would have bought it.

1324
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:06,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Still would have bought it, just to support Chrono Trigger, but a little bit apprehensively.

1325
01:20:07,611 --> 01:20:14,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, maybe if we each buy 50 copies, they'll make Radical Dreamers or some sort of sequel.

1326
01:20:14,473 --> 01:20:15,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Dream on.

1327
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:16,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Dream on with that one.

1328
01:20:16,670 --> 01:20:17,251
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you never know.

1329
01:20:17,451 --> 01:20:17,911
[SPEAKER_13]: You never know.

1330
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:20,192
[SPEAKER_13]: Stranger things have happened, so there you have it.

1331
01:20:20,652 --> 01:20:25,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I have my fingers crossed that Chrono Trigger will do the fans justice.

1332
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:27,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not played the game in so long.

1333
01:20:27,154 --> 01:20:30,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't played Chrono Trigger since I was a kid, so it'll be fun to revisit that series.

1334
01:20:31,396 --> 01:20:31,716
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1335
01:20:31,756 --> 01:20:41,380
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good because a lot of the younger generation who were born in the 90s, they'll actually get a chance to play this because I'm sure there's plenty of people in the chat room who have never played it before.

1336
01:20:42,242 --> 01:20:44,703
[SPEAKER_13]: I am kind of curious, though, how the whole two-screen thing is going to work.

1337
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very curious to see what they do with that.

1338
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:49,725
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be waiting for some more screenshots and stuff.

1339
01:20:50,165 --> 01:20:51,946
[SPEAKER_02]: If they make it 3D, they better do it justice.

1340
01:20:52,086 --> 01:20:52,486
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not.

1341
01:20:53,006 --> 01:20:53,586
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Sprite.

1342
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:54,567
[SPEAKER_13]: It's old-school Sprite.

1343
01:20:55,527 --> 01:20:55,767
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1344
01:20:56,007 --> 01:20:57,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Matt, thank you so much for calling in.

1345
01:20:57,308 --> 01:20:58,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other last words you want to say real quick?

1346
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:00,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two things.

1347
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:03,170
[SPEAKER_01]: When are you guys coming out to New York again?

1348
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey Joe, hey Joe, hey Joe, hey Joe, hey Joe What?

1349
01:21:30,657 --> 01:21:31,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a minute, where have I heard that before?

1350
01:21:32,058 --> 01:21:32,638
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds familiar.

1351
01:21:33,078 --> 01:21:33,359
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1352
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:34,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Later, Matt.

1353
01:21:34,839 --> 01:21:35,900
[SPEAKER_13]: For that, you get hung up on it.

1354
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1355
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:38,562
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1356
01:21:38,582 --> 01:21:41,783
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1357
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:43,785
[SPEAKER_13]: We have got room for about, how long are we running this?

1358
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:45,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit, we're almost to an hour and a half.

1359
01:21:45,586 --> 01:21:48,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe like one more call on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

1360
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:51,749
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1361
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:55,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Sack Anime, a little closer to home, last week of August.

1362
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:56,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Be there.

1363
01:21:56,172 --> 01:21:58,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's Penny Arcade Expo, same weekend.

1364
01:21:58,453 --> 01:21:58,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't do it.

1365
01:21:59,434 --> 01:21:59,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, guys.

1366
01:22:01,946 --> 01:22:02,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1367
01:22:02,746 --> 01:22:03,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, I'll go.

1368
01:22:03,767 --> 01:22:05,687
[SPEAKER_13]: They do like five SAC animes a year.

1369
01:22:05,707 --> 01:22:06,727
[SPEAKER_13]: They do two.

1370
01:22:08,188 --> 01:22:10,209
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like there's a con at the Sonic Center every month.

1371
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:11,949
[SPEAKER_02]: They have two SAC animes a month.

1372
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:15,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, two SAC animes a year and four SAC animes a month.

1373
01:22:16,691 --> 01:22:17,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

1374
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:20,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And four smaller SAC comic cons a year.

1375
01:22:20,652 --> 01:22:20,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1376
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:23,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the local news.

1377
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:24,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

1378
01:22:24,033 --> 01:22:24,873
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Sunrise Mall.

1379
01:22:24,893 --> 01:22:25,413
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

1380
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:25,693
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1381
01:22:26,093 --> 01:22:26,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

1382
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:26,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Look.

1383
01:22:26,794 --> 01:22:28,134
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll stop with the local chat.

1384
01:22:28,174 --> 01:22:29,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk to somebody on the skyline.

1385
01:22:29,415 --> 01:22:30,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1386
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:30,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

1387
01:22:32,532 --> 01:22:32,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hi.

1388
01:22:33,353 --> 01:22:35,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I spaced out there for a sec.

1389
01:22:35,475 --> 01:22:36,457
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Gold Banjo.

1390
01:22:36,517 --> 01:22:36,937
[SPEAKER_13]: That's alright.

1391
01:22:36,977 --> 01:22:39,941
[SPEAKER_13]: The heat is making us spacey too, but it's starting to cool off a little bit, thank God.

1392
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:40,501
[SPEAKER_00]: What's on your mind?

1393
01:22:40,541 --> 01:22:45,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's not as bad over here in New England and New Hampshire, but I feel bad for you guys.

1394
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:46,348
[SPEAKER_13]: That's alright.

1395
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:47,810
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys have to deal with humidity.

1396
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:48,550
[SPEAKER_13]: At least we don't have that.

1397
01:22:48,951 --> 01:22:49,512
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1398
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:58,342
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, actually, I'm one of those Chrono Trigger people, and, well, once again, I know you might not be as crazy about it.

1399
01:22:58,903 --> 01:23:02,886
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually even know much about the game, and I know that I have to play it.

1400
01:23:03,707 --> 01:23:05,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that just goes to show you.

1401
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:06,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's almost an adage.

1402
01:23:06,650 --> 01:23:07,951
[SPEAKER_13]: How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?

1403
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:09,884
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1404
01:23:35,256 --> 01:23:37,417
[SPEAKER_13]: And to the new generation, do it, or I'll come over the internet and kick your ass.

1405
01:24:01,744 --> 01:24:02,805
[SPEAKER_13]: The new generation.

1406
01:24:03,866 --> 01:24:05,447
[SPEAKER_13]: So old.

1407
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Gold Banjo, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1408
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:11,952
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just wanted to call in and say that real quick.

1409
01:24:12,533 --> 01:24:13,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

1410
01:24:15,815 --> 01:24:16,576
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.

1411
01:24:16,736 --> 01:24:17,756
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good night, guys.

1412
01:24:17,796 --> 01:24:18,177
[SPEAKER_13]: You too.

1413
01:24:18,297 --> 01:24:20,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Have fun with Chrono Trigger DS whenever it comes out.

1414
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:22,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm definitely looking forward to it.

1415
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:25,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Call back and let us know what you think, young whippersnapper.

1416
01:24:26,108 --> 01:24:26,388
[SPEAKER_13]: It's hot.

1417
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Hot Garage is very hot, but thankfully it's cooling.

1418
01:24:54,681 --> 01:24:55,922
[SPEAKER_13]: It's getting a little more bearable in here now.

1419
01:24:56,562 --> 01:24:58,543
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, any last-minute stories from you tonight?

1420
01:25:01,445 --> 01:25:06,388
[SPEAKER_12]: I've only been looking at stories, unfortunately, because I've been too busy working on stuff.

1421
01:25:07,088 --> 01:25:08,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see here.

1422
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:11,327
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1423
01:25:33,956 --> 01:25:42,021
[SPEAKER_12]: and apparently they had an elf loader on there that they were able to run a Genesis emulator.

1424
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:45,626
[SPEAKER_12]: On what now?

1425
01:25:46,226 --> 01:25:47,987
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a program called Swap Magic.

1426
01:25:48,107 --> 01:25:51,009
[SPEAKER_12]: It was one of those things to run on PlayStation 3.

1427
01:25:52,730 --> 01:26:02,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Run, I guess, burn games and stuff like that or region-free stuff on the PlayStation 2, but they ran it on the PlayStation 3 and were able to play Genesis Simulator on there.

1428
01:26:02,194 --> 01:26:09,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, you could run Linux or something like that on your other operating system on that and easily run games that way, but

1429
01:26:10,711 --> 01:26:13,072
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not as fun.

1430
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:14,794
[SPEAKER_12]: That was one thing that was kind of interesting.

1431
01:26:17,015 --> 01:26:17,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see.

1432
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:22,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, the Wrath of the Lich King beta signups are open.

1433
01:26:22,578 --> 01:26:22,798
Shh!

1434
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't tell people because I want the key.

1435
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:36,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, speaking of things we missed, if you were an Uru Live fan, a Missed Online fan, on GameTap, they are pulling that.

1436
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:39,909
[SPEAKER_02]: The publishers are taking it back and apparently going to revive the community.

1437
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:41,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, good for them.

1438
01:26:41,952 --> 01:26:42,333
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good.

1439
01:26:42,633 --> 01:26:45,534
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're all three people that enjoyed that, come on back.

1440
01:26:46,814 --> 01:26:47,434
[SPEAKER_11]: There you have it.

1441
01:26:47,614 --> 01:26:49,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, we've got some other things here real quick.

1442
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:55,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Bomberman's coming to the iPhone with Bomberman Touch, which is interesting.

1443
01:26:56,597 --> 01:27:06,221
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I guess Game, the UK retailer, is going to start publishing some independent games.

1444
01:27:08,802 --> 01:27:11,424
[SPEAKER_13]: That's interesting to have a retailer doing that at the front like that.

1445
01:27:11,705 --> 01:27:12,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Exclusives.

1446
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:13,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you say exclusives?

1447
01:27:13,546 --> 01:27:13,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1448
01:27:14,327 --> 01:27:22,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And Sony, I guess, is putting out another game that's going to be, I guess, coming out in September called Aqua.

1449
01:27:23,014 --> 01:27:29,739
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a sequel to Aquanauts Holiday, which is sort of like Endless Ocean on the Wii.

1450
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:32,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So think of Africa, but under the sea.

1451
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:34,864
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks pretty cool, actually.

1452
01:27:36,269 --> 01:27:42,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, there's a rumor that Golf Tee It Up is supposedly coming to Xbox Live Arcade next week.

1453
01:27:43,293 --> 01:27:52,238
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever the hell that's supposed to be, but apparently it has its Xbox.com page now, so that's on there, as well as, I guess, Pirates vs. Ninja Dodgeball.

1454
01:27:52,258 --> 01:27:52,818
[SPEAKER_12]: About time.

1455
01:27:53,877 --> 01:28:01,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there's also a Guitar Hero homebrew game that's supposed to be coming out towards the end of August, August 20th.

1456
01:28:02,044 --> 01:28:03,806
[SPEAKER_12]: It's called Video Game Hero.

1457
01:28:04,447 --> 01:28:07,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Two of the tracks that they have on there, Eye of the Tiger and Inspector Gadget.

1458
01:28:07,690 --> 01:28:08,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Inspector Gadget.

1459
01:28:09,031 --> 01:28:13,095
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the Inspector Gadget theme, which both of them sound kind of like...

1460
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:16,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Very MIDI sounding.

1461
01:28:17,172 --> 01:28:21,699
[SPEAKER_12]: But the game, you use the touch screen or the directional buttons.

1462
01:28:21,739 --> 01:28:23,181
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like Oda Jam almost.

1463
01:28:24,303 --> 01:28:26,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Which, that'd be something else good to bring to the DS.

1464
01:28:26,146 --> 01:28:27,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Very interesting.

1465
01:28:27,227 --> 01:28:27,648
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

1466
01:28:28,697 --> 01:28:29,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Dark Tetsuya, any final thoughts?

1467
01:28:30,018 --> 01:28:30,539
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell is that?

1468
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:56,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

1469
01:28:57,217 --> 01:28:57,497
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know.

1470
01:28:59,419 --> 01:29:01,061
[SPEAKER_13]: That little keychain thing.

1471
01:29:03,724 --> 01:29:04,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma, your final thought.

1472
01:29:05,505 --> 01:29:06,346
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Cyberman.

1473
01:29:07,007 --> 01:29:07,808
[SPEAKER_05]: You were wrong.

1474
01:29:07,828 --> 01:29:08,649
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Cyberman.

1475
01:29:10,751 --> 01:29:11,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Ranma, your final thought.

1476
01:29:12,793 --> 01:29:36,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Google Maps on my phone with GPS has been making me uber geek this entire weekend geek, nerd damn proud of it my final thought is hot DarkSakura exterminate the heap Loki hot chair is hot

1477
01:29:37,597 --> 01:29:37,897
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1478
01:29:38,558 --> 01:29:40,540
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1479
