4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We are live on this 4th of July weekend, except it's actually the 6th of July now in 2008.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Did everybody have a good 4th of July weekend? We have a lot of people in studio tonight.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you haven't listened to part 8 yet, we have tons of guests. Did you guys all have a good 4th of July?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, we had a couple encounters, but yeah.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A couple encounters? What's that mean?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Random encounters.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Random encounters? It's like you are suddenly attacked by a grey slime?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, and just substitute unexpected fireworks.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh yes. Good times. Good times.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now 4th of July, you're from New York City, Rama.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So the 4th of July in a cow town like this one is a little different from what you're used to in Brooklyn, right?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Not necessarily.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Really?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Even out in Brooklyn, it's very suburbanite. Out in New York City, we look forward to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's the big thing.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Do people go shoot their guns off in the middle of the street for 4th of July?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Actually, that's more up in the South Bronx where I used to live.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're confusing that with Texas.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alright, well, we hope everybody had a safe 4th of July. Unless you're not an American citizen, then I hope you had a good Friday.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I would like to say in a very cryptic fashion that thank God the end of my headache is over.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can continue on with the work that I have been working on for a few weeks now.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
If I'm not mistaken, Loki will be unveiling something big on next week's show.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hopefully.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Cross your fingers, cross your toes.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The funny thing about the 4th of July that really quickly, because I went to the extravaganza at Dark Sakura's house that she had,

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
stupid me thought, I want to bring something, I want to contribute to Dark Sakura's thing this year.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't want to be a leecher. So I brought fireworks.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I went out and bought like $40 worth of fireworks and brought it to the party.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was like, okay, cool.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And only to be upstaged by all the more awesome illegal fireworks that were present.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, our neighbor put in money for the legal stuff.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So we never even set my group off.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think we opened yours.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, I don't think we opened it. I brought it back.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, you did? Oh.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So I'm saving it for a rainy day, like Christmas. We'll set up Christmas fireworks or Halloween fireworks.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And we'll open presents next 4th of July.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Quick poll in chat room while we do the next story.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When should I light off the spare fireworks that I have?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
$40 worth of safe and lame fireworks.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When should I light them off?

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
For the fuck show?

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Who knows? In the garage.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That wouldn't be...

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do it now.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Do it now.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our void says now. I don't think that's going to happen, sir.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Alright. It's the 6th of July party. Yay.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Alright, let's get back to some gaming news. Loki, kick it off.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes, no fireworks right now.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But we talked a little bit earlier. Actually, Rob did during his release dates for Japan that Persona 4 was going to be coming out soon.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, guess what? Persona 4 is also making its way to North America as well.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Just not until December 9th.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And that should be pretty awesome.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And it was teased on, I think, a new trailer for Persona 4.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So, December 9th is when you can get your Persona 4 on.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, and it says also that each game will be bundled with the soundtrack CD as well with select music from the game.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And there are many RPG fans going, squee!

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Does it come with a free spirit gun?

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think it's cool, though, that they're still cranking them out for the PlayStation 2.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Quality games for the PlayStation 2. It's not just a budget system.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's still got good stuff.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, it's cheaper to develop for, and if they want to jump to the PS3, they'll still sell probably what they would sell on the PS3 with the PS2.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Alright. Lots of comments from chat about when to light off the fireworks.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Too many people are saying, do it now.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And that's not going to happen with a gas heater in here, okay?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's a bad idea. That's the kind of stuff that you see on America's scariest home videos.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's see. When you know who gets disbarred, says Amaze Satsuma, for the fuck show.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, AJ Mix says at the beginning of the fuck show, and GS68 calls them fuck works. Nice.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I do like that idea.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You can't do it for the fuck show because then you know when the fuck show was.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Exactly. Exactly.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That would ruin it.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright. So we're not doing them now, sorry to say. We're not stupid, and we're not going to end up on headlines.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Anyhow, we were talking about PlayStation 2 games, now PlayStation 2 games are still coming out.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Get this, Sony is actually going to be coming out with an even slimmer and cooler looking, in their words, suave, version of the PlayStation 2.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Here's the interesting thing. It's going to be coming out in India first, and then Europe.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's going to be coming out on October 28th in India. There you have it.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know what that means.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ben Heck will be able to make an even cooler PS2 portable system.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The Economic Times, who reported this initially, also says there will be no more external AC adapter.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The price will still be the same, about $162 American because this is in other countries.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What do you mean no more AC adapter that's external?

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm assuming that means the plug is built right into it, so you don't have to plug in an external adapter now.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's built right into the system, I would imagine.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, I guess. Those power supplies are pretty small nowadays, especially with the micro-ITX stuff.

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There you have it. That's going to be pretty cool.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I wonder if that will come out here most likely. Especially if there's still quality games like Persona 4 coming out, why not?

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's still a demand for it, and hey, they're a cheap DVD player on top of all that other stuff.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
At least that's what the rest of America thinks.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, there you have it. Moving on.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, in other news, there is a list that was released by Hideo Kojima, who said what his top five favorite games are.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He was actually speaking to a newspaper, Yomiuri Shinbun, and he listed Super Mario Bros. series,

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Outerworld, and Xevious as being some of the most memorable and influential games.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He also brought up an 80s adventure game that was only in Japan called Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And, of course, Metal Gear Solid.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Of course. A little ego there. Anything else we'd recognize?

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The Super Mario Bros. series?

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, Super Mario Bros. series. Sorry, I missed that.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Outerworld, Xevious?

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, okay. Sorry, I only picked up the last two for some reason. That's what I get for multitasking.

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But, you know, actually, if Kojima is fouling up this other game that I've never played, then I think I'll have to give it a try.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll try to find out what it's on.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, what's up? Hideo Kojima talks. You listen?

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Alright. Fair enough.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, and I've bumped into him enough times that I think I should.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Awesome.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, there's some interesting stuff coming out now.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
PlayStation.com, I guess, was hacked according to a security firm's report.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The IT security firm Sophos reported that someone has been messing around with the official PlayStation site, the US one.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And, I guess, some of the messing around fits in with fake ads on the SingStar and God of War pages.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And trying to, I guess, I don't know, put viruses or spyware or something.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Were they trying to install spyware on people's computers? Were they trying to say, haha, we pwned Sony or what?

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It says basically that the bogus pop-ups prompted people that saw them to purchase, I guess, what turned out to be bogus anti-virus software.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dope. Oh my god, they put Gator on PlayStation.com.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wow.

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Apparently, though, Sony's already fixed the problem, but, you know.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That still sucks.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I would say, you know, if there was ever a list, and maybe we'll have to do this as a list list someday, even though it isn't directly video game related.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But if there was ever a list of, like, the most evil things to ever hit the internet, like the worst things to ever happen to the internet, Gator would be in the top three.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Absolutely.

132
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
BonziBuddy would be also in the top three.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't get me started on BonziBuddy.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
YouTube.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Alright.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Anyhow, this is sad news in the Sony department. You cannot has Kratos in Soul Calibur IV.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That news was announced 1UP actually revealed at their most recent podcast because they've been playing the game.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Like you bastards.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They actually have the game there in studio because, you know, certain media people are more special-er than everybody else.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And so they've got it.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And they've been playing the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions and no Kratos to be found anywhere unless it was some type of last minute addition.

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But let's see, if you think a big character like Kratos was going to be in a big game like this, do you think something would be a last minute addition?

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Uh, download content.

144
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Possibly. That could be, but I don't know.

145
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I still say slim to none.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It would be, no, they could do that still.

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I mean, as download content, and they could announce it at E3 if they want it to be a surprise.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Because they know better that certain media outlets out there, you know, especially if it leaks out.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, hey, I saw Kratos in Soulcalibur 4 leak, you know, it's just...

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Interesting. Alright, interesting thought.

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Although I'm not that optimistic.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
DarkSoccer, I know you and the Hubby were debating which version of Soulcalibur 4 you were going to get.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Did you finally come to a consensus?

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
360.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And why is that?

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Online.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, because the online...

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Xbox Live is better. Sorry.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Do you think if Kratos had been in the Sony one, do you think that might have tilted you in the other direction?

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Not at all.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Not at all. Not a Kratos fan?

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No. I don't really... Honestly, I don't care.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Alright. Fair enough.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Did anybody check out Soulcalibur on Xbox Live this weekend?

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I didn't hear anyone mention during their gaming weeks.

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I only checked out the demo. I didn't feel good enough reviewing it based on the demo alone.

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But it just seemed like the Dreamcast version.

168
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No EXO. But not that that's bad, because the Dreamcast one was pretty awesome.

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But there you have it.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Alright. Anyhow, here's some content where you guys get to contribute to our program.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's the mailbag.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Every week you guys send us emails.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com and DarkSakura jumps into the emailbag and pulls out a few of her favorite emails to read for you here live on air.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchrater.com is the place to do it.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
DarkSakura, rip it open. What do we got?

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We've actually gotten a crap ton, so I'm very sorry for some of the emails that I am not answering.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm trying to get to ones that I haven't really read before.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No offense to the people who email us all the time. Let's hear from people we don't often hear from.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's see. I'm still actually going through them, so I'll start with this one.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Dear OLR team, my name is Simon and I live in Sweden.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm a first time writer to the show and I've listened for about three years.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I just wanted to tell you, you are the best and ask a question.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Unfortunately I live in a time zone where I can't listen live, so I have to make do with the podcast.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Which, by the way, is the best podcast on the web.

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Anyway, why is part two released so late in the week nowadays?

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't get part two until Friday night and most of the other stuff you talk about by then feels kind of outdated.

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Not that I don't enjoy what you talk about, but is there a reason why it can't be released on Tuesday or Wednesday instead?

188
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's been kind of my fault recently because I've just been so busy on Tuesday and Wednesday nights specifically.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The ball's in my court to get that thing released.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And with my birthday on the 4th of July, especially these past two weeks, it has just been a madhouse.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So I apologize, that's not usually the plan.

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The reason why we don't do it in, well, first off, we just kind of felt, we've been doing it in parts A and B ever since we were syndicated on all games.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And that's just kind of what we've grown used to and we like the fact that people would be getting two shows a week as opposed to just one.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because, you know, we do a pretty darn long show here.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But the idea was to have it sooner in the week, at least 24 to 48 hours out from part A though.

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that's just because that way a lot of RSS audio grabbers will skip a file if you haven't already grabbed it.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Like let's say there's two new shows on the stream, it will only grab the most recent one.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And so people miss out on half the show if they're not updating every day.

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So we try to space it out about 24, 48 hours to make sure people are getting each and every part.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And just to, you know, so that you have something spread out throughout the week.

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because most game shows release on Sunday, Monday. But much fewer of them release on Wednesday, Thursday.

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So that was kind of the whole point about that.

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So that's why we did it that way. So sorry it isn't a popular decision.

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But you never know, especially with our 300th episode coming up and talk of already changing some other things about the show.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You never know, it might be one big show in the future. We'll see.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We reserve the right to change things as we want.

207
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm also not reading part of this email though because it is directed toward somebody else.

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But it says, thank you for an excellent show and take care.

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And there you have it.

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay, this one's from Rissimo, who I don't think I've ever read an email from.

211
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The name sounds familiar but it's been a while.

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hello all, I beat Metal Gear Solid 4 a couple weeks ago.

213
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Everyone used the word epic to describe the game. That's because there's no other word to describe it.

214
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's one of the best games I've ever played, seriously.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm sick of people bitching about games cutscenes and not talking about how great the actual game is.

216
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There's so much diversity in the actual gameplay, I find this alarming.

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I just want to know if any of you actually played it or just watched a bit.

218
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm curious to know what you think.

219
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Lastly, a couple of questions for Jamie.

220
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Okay, did you watch any of the TV channels preceding the game?

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Huh?

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
They're bizarre.

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Okay, and did you see the one where David Hayter experiences the interview from hell?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And if you did, Fangasm much? I don't watch television.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think, is it something like you leave the disc in and you see this random Easter egg stuff?

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No, no, I didn't. Sorry. But I can.

227
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yeah, no, I thought that the game was very diverse in the things that allowed it.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But it's also, I guess this is up on YouTube, but no, never mind.

229
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
PS, I sent you guys a video months ago with my goddaughter playing my great 1000 mile rally arcade machine.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Then I purchased a Street Fighter II machine and I'm now eyeing a pinball table.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I have a lot of pinball in my youth, but don't remember many of the machines.

232
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
One of my customers owns a pinball boutique and suggested either a Black Knight or Addams Family machine is the best ever.

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The Black Knight isn't too banged up, but it needs a bit of work.

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Either one will cost me $2,000.

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I have heard you rave about Black Knight pinball, but can't remember you talking about Addams Family one.

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What says you? Thanks for getting me through this week.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
First of all, there's a Black Knight and a Black Knight 2000.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And if it's Black Knight 2000, it's worthy, but I warn you, the game's a bitch.

239
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's hard. Addams Family is really, really, really fun.

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I love Addams Family.

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And I think that if you're looking for a starter machine, Addams Family is going to be the one to go with.

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think it's rec.pinball.something.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll have to find out the user group that my husband goes on and try to get you in touch with his group

244
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
because Dan started off on a really banged up machine and worked his way up.

245
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
$2,000 for an Addams Family? That's not bad.

246
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
At least as far as I've heard.

247
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You're going to have to go ahead and start investing in rubbers and plastics and get carnauba wax for the boards.

248
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What do I use that for? Oh, pinball.

249
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
For the actual boards themselves.

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Make sure you've got Goo Gone handy and acid-free stuff because Rob.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry, but I didn't know you were talking about pinball.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Rob, resist the urge.

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I live in the gutter.

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just email me later.

255
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Anyway.

256
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Next email, and this actually is somebody different.

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey, guys. Dan Shadow here.

258
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
While I was growing up, I had a lot of adventure and puzzle games to play.

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Some of my favorites were the Monkey Island series, Loom.

260
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Thank you! Loom is great.

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
King's Quest before 3D, Toonstruck the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour.

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
For the most part, those games were just point and clickers,

263
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but they all had great dialogue and good puzzles that fit into the gameplay.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean, insult sword fighting was the best.

265
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
My question is a two-parter.

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Aside from games like Professor Layton and Hotel Dusk,

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
will we ever see a return of the good, plain, fun adventure game?

268
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Part of the greatness of the 7th Guest in the 11th Hour

269
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
was that they were of a much darker tone.

270
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Did you ever play Phantasmagoria?

271
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes, I did play Phantasmagoria. It was awesome.

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
My second question is, if we do ever see more adventure games,

273
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
are they fated to be just childish games that will work for all ages?

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Honestly, I would love to see another Phantasmagoria. Wouldn't that be awesome?

275
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Seven CDs, that game was.

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That game was epic.

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'd love to see another Monkey Island.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Only because the emailer isn't saying it,

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I would hope to gosh you already know about it,

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but Sam and Max, seriously, if you're not playing it,

281
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
this game was made for someone like you who loves these old 90s puzzlers.

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And just the cool thing, and I hate sounding like a salesman for this service,

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
but I do like it. I honestly do.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
GameTap has all these old-school PC games,

285
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
a lot of the ones you're talking about on there.

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Rob, you fight like a dairy farmer.

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Shut up.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, Justin sent me an email that reminded me that the song I was trying to think of was Lab,

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
from 2DX8 style, that had the hearty hadoken.

290
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Well, I'm looking.

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll have to dig it up.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
8th style, Rob.

294
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, yeah, I got it.

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We got an email from Sauce.

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It says, hi, Soess, which is my online nickname of the Saucers.

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Skye, other guy, and DJ Ron, my guest.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Andrew, if he's there too.

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Seeing how I know DarkSakura thoroughly enjoyed reading my lengthy multi-paragraph review

301
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
of the Iron Man video game released by Sony,

302
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I thought it'd only be fair to review another game, Lego Indiana Jones.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But to be kind to her vocal cords rather than writing the review up here in this email,

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've written it up in my own blog and provided a link to paste into the chat room,

305
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
which I will in just a moment.

306
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The journal, though, is marronmarvel.livejournal.com.

307
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's M-A-R-R-O-N, Marvel.

308
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We will soon be writing for Orange Launch Radio when we get our new website done,

309
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
which is the next big task here at Camp O-L-R.

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is part of a project I'm working on for the O-L-R website.

311
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's obviously an aptly named project.

312
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Update the website so more content can be added.

313
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
My bad.

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But for now, the review sits on my own blog until Skye and I can get together and work something out.

315
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The short version of the review is that Lego Indiana Jones is an extremely fun game

316
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
worth investing in for both kids and adults alike.

317
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It comes on a variety of platforms, and I suggest playing it on DS or PSP over Xbox or Wii.

318
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The feel of the game is much more to be enjoyed in small settings

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
between other things like classes on bus rides or what have you

320
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
than as a sit-in-front-of-the-TV console game.

321
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Anyway, that's it for now.

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sure Dark Soccer has another dozen or so emails to read.

323
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Keep up the great work, O-L-R.

324
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Sincerely, your friendly neighborhood sauce.

325
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Friendly neighborhood sauce. I like that. Very nice.

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have posted link in there.

327
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And I love that she's dedicated.

328
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I need someone like that to keep poking me and going,

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
website, website, website, but I'm really glad there's enthusiastic people.

330
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I could do that, but I have sharp things to poke you with.

331
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, I don't like sharp things.

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, me no likey.

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, if you keep poking me, then I am not going to give you.

334
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This song was a bitch on 2DX. That's all I will say.

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Fuck yeah, it was.

336
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think I beat it on 7 keys once and then I died.

337
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There you have it.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's lab.

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That was lab.

340
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Hey guys and gal, I've been listening to this show from us for years.

341
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It is also the first podcast I have ever listened to,

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
but I have never been able to listen live because of school, family, etc.

343
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Abandon them all. Just kidding.

344
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
My computer just became unplugged, give me a second.

345
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Dope.

346
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
There's one thing I really want to know that you guys have never said,

347
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you're gamertags.

348
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I understand if you don't want to share them because of privacy and stuff,

349
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
but it would be great to actually play on live with one of you guys

350
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
and maybe even work on Loki at GTA IV cough.

351
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Love this show and keep up the good work from Taco4Brain,

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
which is my gamertag by the way.

353
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
PS, Imagine Babies would have been a lot better with Harpoon's Fire and Dragon Force.

354
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is going to sound so horrible, but I don't know any other way to put it.

355
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The sad thing is my list, I don't have a problem giving my gamertag out

356
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
because it's on the forums, it's green sky, but it's S-K-I-E.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
All one word.

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But here's the problem, is that my friends list is completely full.

359
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And Microsoft does not address the issue about letting us expand our friends list yet.

360
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I try to when new OLR listeners want to be added,

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I go in my list and I look for people who haven't signed on in like a week

362
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and I'll delete them, but the problem is I'm trying to balance,

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
like I don't want to delete anybody I know offline,

364
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
but I also don't want to make any OLR listeners sad,

365
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
so I'm having to play this really delicate balancing game with the friend list.

366
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
So you can send me a friend request.

367
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I guess I could delete someone who hasn't signed on in a week, but it's tough.

368
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Please don't be hurt if I defriend you or refuse your friend request.

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm just full.

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
And I'm not even on Xbox that often.

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Stop.

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm still waiting on my request.

373
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Didn't I accept it?

374
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It bounced back saying it was full.

375
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oh, you got to like call me or text me and say I'm going to try to add you

376
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
and then I'll dump somebody who hasn't signed on in a week and then add you.

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
How about after the show maybe?

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Alright, we'll do that.

379
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Cool.

380
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
We'll do that after the show.

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's okay.

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
On the same subject, my We Connect 24 is now working.

384
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Nice.

385
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
So if you want to add me.

386
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And it's all in the forum, because you don't know your friend code I would imagine.

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Not that I can.

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But it's all in the friend's code thread on forums.

389
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Or no, orange.radio.com, click on forums.

390
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

391
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There you have it.

392
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
On a similar related note, I don't have a 360,

393
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
so I naturally don't have a gamertag,

394
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
but I am in the O.L. Army clown on X-Fire,

395
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
so if you want to pop on and own my asset like Day of Defeat Source or Counter-Strike,

396
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
feel free.

397
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's in the forums.

398
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Check the thread there under PC Games.

399
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
See, Fear the Claw in chat says,

400
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Aw, how sad.

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Sky has too many friends.

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Cry face.

403
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I hate, I feel like I sound like a stuck up ass when I say that.

404
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Rob.

405
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What?

406
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You are a whore darling.

407
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I just, you know, I.

409
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

410
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Emails, please.

411
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It is what it is.

412
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
All right, what?

413
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm going to quickly go through some of these and paraphrase them.

414
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
GS68, who introduces himself in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

415
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Ola.

416
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Wanted to know what happened to the guy who said the geeks in Otaku

417
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
were the only ones who wanted more storage space,

418
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
and said that it's sad that Representative Nintendo would have to, you know,

419
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
hold to a level of professionalism and didn't.

420
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, you haven't heard from him lately, so that's hopefully a good sign.

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Thumbs up, Nintendo.

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
He liked the interview.

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Good.

424
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And wants us to come to Final Mate 2009, which will be a likely.

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Most likely, yeah.

426
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Outlook good on the Magic 8 Ball.

427
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And says, this email was brought to you by Sizzler Home of the Endless Salads.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
By the way, California Extremes in two weeks starts soccer.

429
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm going.

430
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Do we want to check out there?

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Fuck yeah.

432
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You have room in your car for one more?

433
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Sure.

434
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
All right.

435
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You're only going for the one day, right?

436
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You're not going to stay overnight or anything?

437
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't think we're going to stay overnight, but we might go back.

438
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Okay.

439
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I might just go for one day.

440
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think we're going to do the Saturday.

441
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Honestly, I think I'd only be able to stay in the one day.

442
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, I think we'll both go on Saturday.

443
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It'll be fine.

444
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'll come with if you don't mind the extra room.

445
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Go for it.

446
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
All right.

447
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
OLR car trip.

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Anyway, short email from Salt Tech.

449
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hey, OLR, I was learning if anyone, including chat,

450
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
knows anything about whether Diablo 3 will be pay-to-play like World of Warcraft

451
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
or buy the game like Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 anyway.

452
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Love the show.

453
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm glad to hear you like the email address.

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's actually supposed to be 666% pure evil,

455
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
but you can't use the percent character in email addresses,

456
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
so it ended up with being what it is now.

457
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Keep up the great work.

458
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Also, periods help.

459
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So far as I know, and this comes as a Blizzard fan,

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
it's going to be pay-once-and-play, just standard Battle.net model.

461
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Why not?

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Diablo 2 is the same way.

463
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I mean, if Blizzard were to change it now,

464
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
they'd just be getting greedy, bastards.

465
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But I don't think that's going to be the case.

466
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
At any rate, next email is,

467
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
hey, I'm sorry, dear OLR,

468
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
hi, you guys are awesome.

469
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Anyway, I remember I was listening to you guys one time,

470
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
how you said you can't find awesome arcades anymore, cry.

471
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But there's still one, kind of.

472
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, I live in Houston, Texas, and we have this anime arcade.

473
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
When I found out about this arcade, I was like,

474
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
OMG, Houston has something cool?

475
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
So I made my parents take me there with a friend,

476
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and we were all like, where is it?

477
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But just when we were about to give up, my mom was all like,

478
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
hey, is that it?

479
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
And I'm like, yes, it is.

480
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So we take a look inside, and my parents all confused

481
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
because they aren't otaku, and it was awesome.

482
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It was called Planet Zero.

483
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And I was so happy I almost cried

484
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
because they had imported games such as popin' music.

485
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yay.

486
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The only thing that really, really sucked was that the arcade was small,

487
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
but that's okay.

488
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
It's still cool.

489
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Well, thank you for taking the time to read this story.

490
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's long.

491
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
LOL, your friend Isabelle.

492
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But it's signed as ro.

493
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Last email.

494
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It is a long one.

495
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
All right.

496
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Long email is long.

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But this one is special because of their ISP,

498
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
which I think is funny.

499
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm not going to say.

500
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, we can't say the...

501
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh, okay.

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Well, actually, I'm pretty sure that the name is pronounced Nige

503
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
just as a nickname.

504
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
All right.

505
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I always think about this one song that has the name

506
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
of this supermarket chain in the title.

507
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Anyway.

508
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
All right.

509
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Read the email.

510
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Fine.

511
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Dear OLR,

512
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I finally had my first sustained encounter with the PSP last week

513
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
after years of getting my gaming fix on a Nintendo system.

514
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And I was very surprised how much I liked it.

515
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
The public perception of Sony's computer entertainment strategy

516
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
at the moment generally seems to be one of the companies

517
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
suffering a midterm malaise, much like Nintendo went through

518
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
after the year of the 16-bit era until the Wii slash DS combo.

519
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
As you always rightly say, it's all about the games.

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And although there were a handful of interesting titles in the PSP,

521
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
it never really grabbed my attention until Crisis Core arrived in Europe.

522
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
As my girlfriend has a PSP, I decided to buy the game and give it a go.

523
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The game itself is very good.

524
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I have to disagree with Logie's comments a couple episodes back.

525
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I find it very entertaining.

526
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Part of the reason for this personally, I feel,

527
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
is because I've been out of the Final Fantasy universe for so long.

528
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I played Final Fantasy Tactics on GBA,

529
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
the Kratty Crystal Chronicles spin-offs,

530
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
and the Boring Revenant Wings game on the DS,

531
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
along with some of the mundane remakes,

532
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
but not any of the console games since Final Fantasy IX.

533
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I really like the art style and the more fluid battle mechanics

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
that appears to have replaced the original turn-based system.

535
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I also think that the mission structure fits the portability of the PSP.

536
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I can pick up the game and play a mission for five minutes

537
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
whilst in a shop or sitting on the toilet hem,

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and then can put it down again.

539
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I had told you I keep a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the bathroom.

540
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
When I'm ready to spend time with the story,

541
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
then I can get bogged down in wasting an hour or two,

542
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
but when I'm ready.

543
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Anyway, that's not my main point.

544
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Accessing the PSP has been like opening a shiny door in my head.

545
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That's nice.

546
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What a wonderful product.

547
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
With all that functionality, it really is a media center in your pocket.

548
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I guess it could be argued that Sony's insistence

549
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
on turning their game machines into home computers

550
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
may have been something of a flaw in their strategy,

551
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but then this is also the first week

552
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
that I have been listening to the OLR podcast

553
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
out in the sunshine on a PSP

554
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
before catching up on other RSS feeds

555
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
that I regularly check out on my desktop PC,

556
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
which I couldn't do on my DS.

557
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And thank you for making us your first priority this week.

558
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
There are pros and cons to any product in a competitive marketplace.

559
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
The opportunity cost of the next best alternative

560
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
will always be subjective.

561
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
However, with Nintendo's seemingly lackluster provision of mature,

562
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
and by that design I don't necessarily mean emirated,

563
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
just intelligent grown-up design versus the likes of Imagine Baby's titles,

564
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
and the lack of desire to provide choice,

565
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Goodbye Freeloader and region-free gaming,

566
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
the historic poor strategic vision in PAL territories,

567
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and of course the fact that we are seen to be geeks in Otaku,

568
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm starting to feel marginalized by Nintendo,

569
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
who I once championed so much,

570
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it seems ironic that in the moment of their greatest commercial success,

571
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I find myself completely disinterested by what they have to offer.

572
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It may have something to do with my age,

573
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and my gaming habits,

574
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
but I am, or rather have been, a loyal customer,

575
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and I do agree with you, and I'm not much older than you.

576
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
My girlfriend, the PSP owner,

577
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
who fits the historic profile of a traditional European gamer,

578
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
having been raised on PC and home computer gaming scene

579
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
in the late 80s and early 90s,

580
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
rather than foreign consoles, asked Kropotkin for more info,

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
summed it up neatly for me recently.

582
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You were once their target market, but not anymore.

583
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I guess it really is that simple.

584
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What the Nintendo marketing executive said with their vision really is,

585
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and I'm fine with that.

586
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
They are opening up gaming to a broader audience,

587
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
making it socially acceptable lifestyle activity.

588
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You just have to look at all of those unrealistically happy generations of families

589
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
in their TV commercials to get a sense of that.

590
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Who would have thought Granny would ever get so enthused by virtual puppies

591
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and Sudoku puzzles whilst bonding with their grandchildren

592
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
on an expensive nuclear family vacation to an unspecified exotic location?

593
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So why am I bothering to say anything at all?

594
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I just want Nintendo to know that,

595
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
thanks largely to the production of the must-want titles

596
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
by their competitors and tepid treatment of their customer base,

597
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
a personal tipping point has finally been reached.

598
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I'm in the market for a PSP Slim and a PS3 now.

599
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
My Wii is gathering dust, my DS gets the occasional play,

600
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and I think I'm not alone.

601
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Very interesting quote in there, something about,

602
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
you were the target audience, but not anymore.

603
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
It kind of hurts to hear, but I think your girlfriend's on to something with that.

604
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Was that his quote or the girlfriend? I don't remember.

605
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But whoever said that is definitely on to something.

606
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Kind of sad, but I think something the hardcore gaming fans forget once in a while,

607
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
like, OMG, Nintendo, how could you screw us over like this?

608
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, it was so much better when it was 8-bit.

609
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Well, it's not 8-bit anymore.

610
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We're not 13 anymore, you know?

611
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
That was the last one I'm reading.

612
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And I'm sorry to everybody else that I skipped over, you know,

613
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I had a shit ton of emails.

614
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
But there's always next week. Mailbag at orangeontrudy.com.

615
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah, I'm leaving the ones I haven't read as unread.

616
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And maybe we'll post some on the forums and respond to them there, you never know.

617
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Maybe.

618
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We'll see.

619
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Alright, mailbag at orangeontrudy.com if you'd like to contribute to Dark Soccer's massive emails.

620
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There you go.

621
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Alright, back to some gaming news, eh, Loki?

622
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes. Well, let's see, there was an interesting rumor that came out this week.

623
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:09,000
About a 60GB Xbox 360 Pro model that's supposedly going to be announced at E3.

624
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's interesting because, you know, this is around the same time that we've been seeing retailer ads for a 20GB model being dropped down to $299.

625
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
And, of course, as usual, this is a rumor.

626
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

627
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And who knows if it's true.

628
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
But yeah, I guess we'll just have to wait until E3 to see if it's true.

629
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But boy, wouldn't E3 be a really good time to announce something like this?

630
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, that would be a very good time to announce something like this.

631
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And don't you think you'd have to tell all these people in advance what you're doing and just pray the news doesn't get out there like it has been?

632
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah, that would, you know, a lot of trust in the industry there.

633
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:15,000
And, you know, it would really suck if it seems like some of these websites like Ars Technica would happen to leak an email that, you know, was sent out by Microsoft detailing exactly what they were going to be talking about at E3.

634
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Quandary.

635
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes, that's really sad.

636
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Really sad.

637
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But we're sure that that wouldn't happen, right?

638
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That would never happen.

639
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Not at all.

640
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But, you know, hey, these Microsoft rumors, they're never true.

641
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Well, now, something else we can either confirm nor deny, and really we're in the dark about this one, is Halo.

642
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Here's the interesting thing. It's an article that's being run on computer and video games, that website, and it's apparently also coming from Sarcastic Gamer, which is another podcast, and their own internal quote-unquote sources.

643
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Apparently there is a new Halo game that is going to be unveiled at E3.

644
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Here's the thing, though. It could be Peter Jackson's game, but the interesting thing about it, it will not have the Master Chief in it.

645
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So could the Halo franchise survive without Master Chief?

646
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I don't know. I forgot to mention, too, as part of that story, the 20 gig model is rumored to being phased out with this price drop.

647
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You may remember last year, I believe, when the 80 gig came out, they dropped the price of the 60 gig also for the PS3.

648
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Same type of thing.

649
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But we would have no idea if that is actually happening.

650
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Yes, we would have absolutely no idea that something like that would actually be happening.

651
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Right.

652
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
A question for our guests in the studio, since we haven't heard from you in a little bit. Could Halo work without Master Chief?

653
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Ask someone who fucking cares.

654
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Alright, then.

655
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Well, they have Halo Wars, and I'm pretty sure Master Chief's not in that.

656
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Why not?

657
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Tell a game about Cortana.

658
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
A game centered around Cortana? Okay, maybe. Maybe. Alright, getting warmer.

659
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Rama, any thoughts?

660
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I could give two shits about Halo, really.

661
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You know what would be awesome? Red vs. Blue, the game.

662
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
That'll work. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

663
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Rabble, rabble.

664
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I would play sister.

665
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
They could do a Halo game without Master Chief, but that's like a Halloween movie without Jamie Lee Curtis.

666
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
It's just destined not to be as good. Come on. Come on.

667
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Alright.

668
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That broke me.

669
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That broke you?

670
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Yes.

671
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Syntax error.

672
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think it would be with the Arbiter.

673
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Who knows? E3, we'll find out, but I can't believe that Halo would be a franchise.

674
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Microsoft would just like, go away into the sunset.

675
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It'll be back one way or another. We'll see.

676
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Well, this makes me plenty happy.

677
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,000
A new zombie smacking mini game is coming out called The House of the Dead EX.

678
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's zombie love, zombie rock, zombie bowling, zombie whacking, zombie shooting.

679
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Zombie whacking?

680
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Yep, some zombie love.

681
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But it's actually, I do believe, it has a lot to use the guns or this sort of pedal that's on it, like in Time Crisis.

682
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,000
But it's an arcade machine, and it's also in a really cutesy, kind of bizarro, cel-shaded anime style.

683
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's the cel-shaded, sort of like how House of the Dead 3 was, but it's just cute.

684
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Well, House of the Dead 3 was supposed to be cel-shaded anyway.

685
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But it's a light gun game, and it has pedal, and it's House of the Dead EX.

686
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Cute.

687
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I don't think zombies and cute should ever be in the same sentence, unless you have a knot in there, but...

688
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah, I don't know.

689
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It sounds like...

690
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And then will Ubi Bol be basing a new movie based on that too?

691
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
No.

692
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Where the zombies are like in love?

693
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I'm thinking no.

694
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I think Ubi Bol will be a zombie in the game.

695
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't go there. For the love of God, don't go there.

696
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Maybe a boss. I think he should be a boss.

697
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
There you go.

698
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Zombies got talent, says his fan to listen to chat.

699
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Now they're just doing all these zombie things in chat.

700
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, not to sound like, as Rob put it earlier, advertising for GameTap.

701
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
But, GameTap is going to be putting up American McGee's Grimm pretty soon.

702
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And one thing they're going to be doing that's a little bit different is that each episode will be free,

703
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
or be a free download, and remain a free download for a 24 hour period.

704
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:46,000
After that, each episode will go into GameTap's archives and be available to download individual for a yet to be determined price.

705
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Where the fuck is Alice, by the way?

706
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
We need an American McGee game. We need Alice.

707
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Is that not on GameTap yet? I thought it was.

708
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I have not seen Alice on GameTap.

709
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
It's probably coming. You can bet that if this game...

710
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,000
They're probably waiting until like a month before or something. We'll see.

711
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So, these will all... I guess the first one is going to debut on July 31st.

712
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And it's going to be called A Boy Who... A Boy Learns What Fear Is.

713
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh my. Sounds a little scary.

714
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Well, changing gears here and moving on to something completely different.

715
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You know when this music plays, the news is not going to be good, folks.

716
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
You heard that when the Sony PlayStation 3 launched, you heard all sorts of crazy shit happen.

717
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
People were getting shot up in line. People were getting the Sony PlayStation 3 stolen from them right out of their hands.

718
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
But now, kids, we have reached the lowest of the low.

719
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
And it didn't even happen in the U.S. It happened in Australia.

720
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I thought everyone got along in Australia, but no, this is how horrible it is.

721
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Zach Tooey... I apologize if I mispronounce that, but Zach Tooey, unfortunately, he has a form of muscular dystrophy.

722
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
And he is confined in a wheelchair for most of his life.

723
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
He was able to get something from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

724
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And Zach opted to get a PlayStation 3 from the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which, by the way, is a great charity.

725
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I've helped raise money for them before. They're a wonderful, wonderful charity.

726
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Here's the thing. The charity got him the PlayStation 3, got him the games, and this week, thieves broke into his home and stole everything.

727
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Jewelry, appliances, PlayStation 3, and all the games.

728
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Fuckers!

729
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Maybe his wish was to be mugged.

730
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I don't think so. I think, uh, this is one of those things where I would say, this country's going to hell, but, uh, unfortunately, it didn't happen here.

731
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
This world's going to hell. Congratulations, everybody.

732
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But then again, it's Australia. We didn't see that coming.

733
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
No, no, no. There's a lot of nice people living in the land of upside-down-ness.

734
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, you don't want to go there.

735
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think, yeah, don't go there, girlfriend.

736
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:10,000
All right. So, obviously, that's, uh, that's about 99 different ways of fucked up, and we will count them out for you right now.

737
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Or at least give you our FUs of the week.

738
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Oh, this is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

739
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
This is fucked up!

740
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
That's Sakura.

741
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,000
FU to the 580. And, um, FU to the asshole.

742
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You know, FU getting pulled over.

743
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Snap.

744
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I got pulled over at the, uh, Sacramento airport.

745
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Um, first of all, I was dead tired, exhausted after having driven most of the day and wandering all over the city.

746
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Well, all over Virginia County and Berkeley and all this.

747
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And we talked to the AMPM there, and I had to circle back around so I could actually get back there to get some coffee.

748
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And I ended up pulling out and going to the Garden Highway and some to the exit on the 5 going, you know, trying to find my way out.

749
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And I got pulled over, and my tags, um, need renewing.

750
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But they wanted to search the trunk and do all this stuff, and it turned out...

751
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Damn!

752
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It turned out that, um, they were looking for someone.

753
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
They were asking all of our IDs and checking everything, but they left me off in the morning.

754
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Were they looking for someone that looks like you? Of all things?

755
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't know, but it was my evil twin Skippy.

756
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Wow.

757
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I like how you have an evil twin named Skippy.

758
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Skippy Sakura. Dark Skippy.

759
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Light Sakura. It was Light Sakura.

760
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:50,000
No. But, um, but, uh, you know, one of the names for evil Sakura is Hiakeshika Sakura, which is lumber?

761
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Does Skippy have a mustache like Evil Spock?

762
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
No.

763
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Alright.

764
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
No!

765
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Alright, I'm sorry. Anything else Dark Sakura?

766
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yes!

767
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Okay.

768
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You didn't give me a ticket. I got to go.

769
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And then we heard, we heard, uh, a sort of, uh, yelling fight at the Chevron station, which was stupid.

770
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Nice.

771
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I said, man, people, if you're going to argue with somebody and talk shit, no one else cares to hear your fucking nonsense.

772
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Go keep it to yourselves or talk somewhere like civil human beings and say,

773
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That bitch!

774
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You know.

775
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Be civil.

776
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Be mature.

777
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm sorry. Game Guru corrected me. Evil Spock had a beard, not a mustache.

778
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Sorry, nerd Trekkie. I'm just kidding.

779
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
So rude.

780
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But, but, but, but, but, also, also one last thing.

781
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
A semi-F you to the ending of Doctor Who.

782
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
The season ending of Doctor Who.

783
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Because it was sort of a cop-out.

784
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And it was, as a, as a fangirl, I did have my fangasm, and I'm sorry.

785
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I want to look as good as Liz Sladen when I am 60 years old.

786
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Because that woman is gorgeous.

787
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But, um, but it was, it was, it was a bit of happy at the end.

788
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Just a little cop-y-outy.

789
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Just a little cop-y-outy.

790
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But I'm wondering, there's two people who are, I don't want to spoil it.

791
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I don't want to spoil it. I'm not gonna.

792
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Just, ahhh!

793
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Fangirlism.

794
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Next.

795
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Um, let's see.

796
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I would have said F you to, um, programming.

797
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But I don't have reason to do that anymore.

798
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Um, so I'm gonna say F you to my car being in the shop still.

799
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Um, unfortunately the, I guess, thermostat housing is, um, busted and leaking coolant.

800
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So I took it in on the 4th of July.

801
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
And, um, unfortunately the dealership was closed.

802
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And they were unable to fix it.

803
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So now I have to wait for my car until Monday when the dealership is open.

804
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Because that's, um, the only place that has a part.

805
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So that sucks.

806
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Even though I could have driven my car, you know, leaking coolant, as I've been doing.

807
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Ah, it might not have been, it might not have been fun.

808
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It was alright, but, you know, um, I just want to get it fixed.

809
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Alright, let's keep the F yous moving.

810
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm gonna make mine quick.

811
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
F you to drama.

812
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
F you to unnecessary drama.

813
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's sad.

814
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Makes me pain in places I didn't know I had.

815
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Rama!

816
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Which rhymes with drama.

817
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Rama drama.

818
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
But that should be a podcast you should do.

819
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Rama drama.

820
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Rama does not rhyme with drama.

821
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I know, I'm just, in my real ghetto, don't know how to speak thing.

822
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Okay, drama llama rama.

823
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm going to let that one slide.

824
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
You should have a podcast where you just talk about drama in the cosplay world.

825
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I bet it's hilarious.

826
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Oh, I do slip some in there from time to time.

827
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Alright, F yous of the week.

828
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I need to stop.

829
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
F yous of the week.

830
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
First, F you to people who have made my vacation a living hell that started off.

831
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't need to hear from you.

832
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Leave me alone.

833
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Second F you to Continental Airlines.

834
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yes, my friend will help me out, but still, I don't want to be stuck in Texas for nine hours.

835
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Okay?

836
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
At George Bush?

837
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Yeah.

838
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
What the hell?

839
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And your luggage went to New Orleans, which sounds so much like Sacramento.

840
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But your luggage did come back from its early Mardi Gras, like Saw said.

841
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, but the thing is, when I opened up the bag, there was no tequila, no alcohol, no nothing.

842
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
That's an evil bag.

843
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Or boobs.

844
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Exactly, not even beads.

845
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I mean, really.

846
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,000
All there was was, you know, parts of Hurricane Katrina and...

847
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Boo, too soon.

848
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
No, dude, no.

849
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Alright, Dark Tetsuya.

850
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Ah, fuck this heat.

851
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh my god.

852
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yeah, fuck the heat.

853
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm dying.

854
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I am dying, too.

855
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh, sorry.

856
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Oh.

857
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
You gotta give him nice, loud, hearty, fuck the heat.

858
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Sorry, yeah.

859
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Fuck this heat.

860
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
There you go.

861
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
A little better.

862
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Alright.

863
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Yeah, I'll second the fuck you to the heat.

864
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'll second the fuck you to drama.

865
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Fuck you to Ubisoft for not making sure that a game works before they push it out the door.

866
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Speaking of, of course, Ghost Recon, Assault Warfighter 2, which decides to crash as soon as I load a level.

867
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
FU not being able to drive yet, not being able to learn to drive yet, because of this heat.

868
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Because the car is way too fucking hot by the time I get in it, and it's been driven in a while, so fuck that shit.

869
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And just fuck waiting around for people to look at resume shit.

870
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Driving me crazy.

871
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Alright.

872
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
That's gonna do it for the FUs of the Week.

873
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It was kinda long tonight, but we had a lot of angst here in studio, which makes up for some of the weeks past where we didn't have that much angst.

874
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So there you have it.

875
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:57,000
But now we need to change the tone here in studio a little bit, because we got Match Game coming up, so I need something a little bit lighter fare.

876
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
And believe it or not, of all people, I'm gonna turn to Jamie for something a little lighter fare.

877
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Death, death, blood, shit, and puke.

878
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Not helping.

879
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And cornflakes.

880
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Okay. In actual news, I really have to give it to the male population of Canada, because there is a study that has come out, a survey actually that Microsoft put out, wondering how many, well out of a thousand gamers in Canada, how many of them play naked?

881
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And this is something we really needed to know.

882
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
This was like, you know, scientifically sensitive, you know, we need to know this information.

883
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:52,000
17% of men game naked, and 9% of women game naked.

884
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Like all the time, or just have once in a while? Or like have before?

885
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I don't know, but get plastic wrap for your controller, please.

886
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
So here's my question.

887
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
They say this about Canadian gamers, but I'm wondering if it's true about American gamers.

888
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm wondering something here.

889
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I wonder if the people who took the survey counted, say, taking a handheld into the bathroom as gaming naked.

890
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I don't know about that.

891
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
It's a valid question. It's a valid question.

892
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay, outside of the handheld in the bathroom, who has ever game naked? Darkside, have you ever game naked?

893
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Yes, I have.

894
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Do you remember what game?

895
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Well, first of all, I was running a fever of 103.

896
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Okay.

897
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
It probably wasn't DDR.

898
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
No, it was actually Super Mario 3, I think. No, it was before that.

899
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I think it was Top Gun.

900
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Nice.

901
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Loki, have you ever game naked?

902
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I always game naked under my clothes.

903
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
No, really? No, really?

904
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
No, no, I haven't.

905
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Okay, so we're 50% so far.

906
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Romba, ever game naked?

907
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Normally my lawyer would tell me not to answer, but yeah.

908
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
And it was Dance Dance Revolution.

909
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
That's the limit, no.

910
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Me too.

911
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Wait.

912
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
When I was done, there was a bunch of fangirls outside wanting my autograph with the other pen.

913
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I didn't do it in a public setting.

914
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm sorry?

915
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You have to try it.

916
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I was in my own house. I didn't know the window. I wasn't looking.

917
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Close the shades.

918
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Alright, alright.

919
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I denied a fangirl what they wanted.

920
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Drew?

921
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Drew?

922
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
To make them want it more.

923
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Drew, have you ever game nude?

924
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I have to say, with all confidence, I have not. I don't plan to.

925
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I've lied naked in the bed playing PSP.

926
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Alright.

927
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Dark Tetsuya?

928
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I know.

929
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
But here, look at that.

930
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I just want to say, out of the studio, even though we're including men and women because dark soccer is here,

931
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
three of us have game nude, three of us have not.

932
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
That means 50% of Americans have game naked, so take that Canada.

933
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
That's why you can never trust a poll.

934
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Take that.

935
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The numbers are manipulated by the ones who ask the questions.

936
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Alright. Anyhow, so there you have it.

937
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?

938
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Have you ever read a book in the bathroom?

939
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Now that we've thoroughly grossed out the chat room, Shadow Slider says, game naked. What kind of poll was this?

940
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's my thoughts exactly. Why did this need to be asked?

941
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Why does Microsoft care?

942
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Are they trying to do naked fun games?

943
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
GameGrew asks, is Jess wearing underwear?

944
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I vote for more naked fun games.

945
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'm all for naked Twister.

946
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Naked is naked.

947
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Naked is just naked.

948
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
It's just naked.

949
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
People are too bent up.

950
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Actually, this is actually sort of one of the things we talked about in my massage school,

951
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
about working on people's gluteal muscles.

952
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Don't be afraid. It's just a butt. You've got one too.

953
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And if they fart, they fart.

954
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I've had people fart on the table, Rob, and one of those people is in this room.

955
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Nice. Alright.

956
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm not naming names.

957
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Let's go to, while the comedy is still going here on Orange Launch Radio,

958
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
let's go to one of our favorite segments here on Orange Launch Radio.

959
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That's right, guys. It's time for the OLR Match Game.

960
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And in order to play the match game tonight, we need contestants.

961
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
So, folks in chat, if you want to play match game tonight,

962
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
say me once and only once.

963
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
If you say it more than once, you're disqualified.

964
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
You just say me period or no period.

965
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Nothing else besides that.

966
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
If you'd like to play match game in our chat tonight, just say me.

967
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
While I introduce tonight, celebrities playing tonight's match game.

968
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
If you've never heard the match game before,

969
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
it's just like the old school game show, which is coming back, by the way.

970
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Which I heard the news recently.

971
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Oh, that's hardcore. That's awesome.

972
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
It already did. It starts like in a few weeks on Comedy Central.

973
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Awesome. Well, joining us tonight for OLR Match Game,

974
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
we have the one and only man right here from New York City.

975
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Say hello to DJ Ronda S.

976
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Hi, I'm DJ Ronda S. This is my first day of being sober.

977
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Oh, sorry. This is not AA.

978
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
All right.

979
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Say hello as well to Dark Tetsuya is here,

980
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
the man that actually updates at orangelandradio.com once in a while.

981
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Yes, sir.

982
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
All right. There he is.

983
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Hard working as ever.

984
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And also joining us tonight, Intern Drew.

985
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yo, what's up?

986
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
All right.

987
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Loki is here as well.

988
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yes, I am.

989
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
And Dark Sakura.

990
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Yo.

991
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
And me.

992
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That's six opportunities to match tonight.

993
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Huge celebrity panels. Everybody's got something they can write with

994
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
or think their answer is at least in their head.

995
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Okay, good.

996
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
All right.

997
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Rama, since you're our out-of-town visitor,

998
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
pick a number between one and 15.

999
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Seven.

1000
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
All right. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1001
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Rapid Slasher is going to be our chatter tonight.

1002
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
If I didn't count that exactly, too bad.

1003
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
So I'm going to say, are you there?

1004
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Make sure he can send me a private message.

1005
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Otherwise, he's cute.

1006
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
All right.

1007
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
So we have Rapid Slasher playing in chat tonight

1008
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
if he responds to my message.

1009
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Let's get somebody on the Skype line.

1010
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
He's got to play against somebody on the telephone.

1011
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1012
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Our username on Skype.

1013
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So now I have to type to Rapid Slasher.

1015
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Stand by to play.

1016
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Happy face.

1017
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
All right.

1018
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Skype line is open.

1019
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1020
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
If you want to challenge Rapid Slasher in tonight's OLR match game.

1021
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And let's go to the phones.

1022
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1023
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Who's this?

1024
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Hello, who's this on Orange Lounge Radio?

1025
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
GS68, but it says...

1026
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Are you there?

1027
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It's GS68.

1028
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Hi, GS68.

1029
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Can you hear us OK?

1030
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Yep.

1031
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
All right.

1032
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Sounds good.

1033
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Well, GS68, welcome.

1034
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Are you ready to play the match game against Rapid Slasher?

1035
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yep.

1036
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
All right.

1037
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Are you going to kick his ass?

1038
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Well, I don't know how long he's been listening.

1039
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
All right.

1040
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Well, here it is.

1041
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Do you know how to play GS68?

1042
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
You know how the match game works?

1043
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yep.

1044
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So I'm going to explain anyway.

1045
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,000
We're going to read a sentence or a phrase, some type of topical sentence or phrase.

1046
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Somewhere in the phrase there will be a blank.

1047
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
OK?

1048
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And it will be your job to match our celebrity panel here in studio with the best answer.

1049
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
OK?

1050
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And you'll be playing against Rapid Slasher who will be submitting his answers in chat.

1051
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
OK?

1052
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Sound good?

1053
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Yes.

1054
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You ready to play?

1055
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
All right.

1056
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Three questions tonight.

1057
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Here is the first question.

1058
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Here it is.

1059
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
This past Tuesday was Canada Day!

1060
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Happy Canada Day to all our Canadian Lizards!

1061
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
This past Tuesday was Canada Day!

1062
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,000
To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would play all his games in the nude for

1063
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
that day.

1064
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:42,000
The first game he played was blank.

1065
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would play all his games in the nude for

1066
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
that day.

1067
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
The first game he played was blank.

1068
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Celebrity panelists thinking about their answers.

1069
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Ding, ding, ding.

1070
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Dangia68 says, ding.

1071
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Did everybody ding?

1072
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
All right.

1073
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Hold on. I'm thinking of my answer.

1074
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I have my answer actually.

1075
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Okay.

1076
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
All right. So did everybody ding?

1077
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Here in studio? Anyone still thinking?

1078
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
We're waiting on RapidSlasher. He's got to send me an answer.

1079
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Send me

1080
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
an

1081
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
answer. And if you want to help our players out,

1082
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
you can always answer in the chatroom.

1083
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
chat.orangewonchradio.com

1084
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So if RapidSlasher hasn't thought of anything,

1085
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
you should take one of the

1086
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
chatroom answers.

1087
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Let me turn down the music there. It was a little loud there. Sorry about that.

1088
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
All right.

1089
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Still waiting on RapidSlasher.

1090
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
If you can hear me,

1091
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
sir, please hurry up.

1092
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Did he leave?

1093
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Is he still there? Oh, oh.

1094
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
All right. There we go. We got an answer. All right.

1095
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Here we go.

1096
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
GS68.

1097
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
This past Tuesday was Canada

1098
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Day. To celebrate Canada Day, Rob

1099
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
decided that he would play all his games in the

1100
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
nude for that day. The first game he played

1101
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
was?

1102
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
The Guardian Legend. The Guardian Legend,

1103
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
says GS68. The Guardian

1104
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Legend. All right. And RapidSlasher said

1105
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
the first game he

1106
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
played was Guitar Hero.

1107
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
All right. So we have The Guardian

1108
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Legend, Guitar Hero. Let's see if we've matched anyone

1109
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
on the panel. Rama S. What did

1110
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
you say? Or is it just Rama now?

1111
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Just Rama. Oh, sorry. Rama

1112
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
no S. The first game he

1113
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
played was? I said

1114
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Rez. Rez.

1115
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Oh, Trans Vibrators?

1116
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Yes or no?

1117
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Oh, hell yes. Oh, hell yes. All right.

1118
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Can I get a hell yeah? All right. No comment.

1119
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
There it is, Rez. DarkTetsuya,

1120
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
the first game he played was? I also

1121
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
said Rez. Rez!

1122
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Two people saying Rez in the studio. All right.

1123
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
The first game he played was?

1124
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Imagine Babies.

1125
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
That's just wrong.

1126
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
That's very wrong. All right.

1127
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Loki. So 0-0 so far.

1128
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Sorry GS68. Let's see if we get a match on Loki.

1129
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Loki, the first game he played was? I said

1130
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
MapleStory because, you know,

1131
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
it's Canada Day, so

1132
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Maple.

1133
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Boo.

1134
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Where's that Price is Right losing noise?

1135
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
All right.

1136
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
No, just kidding, Loki. That was funny.

1137
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
DarkSakura. You didn't say video game.

1138
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
No, I didn't say video game.

1139
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I said Whack-A-Mole.

1140
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Whack-A-Mole.

1141
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Wow.

1142
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
All hail DarkSakura.

1143
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Wow.

1144
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Uh-uh.

1145
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You haven't heard my answer yet.

1146
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
All right.

1147
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So my answer this past

1148
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Tuesday was Canada Day. Did I say

1149
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Guitar Hero or Rez, or not Rez,

1150
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Guitar Hero or Guardian Legend? Let's see.

1151
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
To celebrate Canada Day, Rob decided that he would

1152
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
play all his games in the nude for that day.

1153
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
The first game he played was

1154
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
BeatMania.

1155
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
That was my second choice.

1156
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Hello.

1157
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
BeatMania.

1158
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
2DX.

1159
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Right Side Pride, yo.

1160
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1161
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
That's not right.

1162
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
That explains the firm handshake.

1163
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
All right.

1164
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
There you have it.

1165
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Welcome to the match game.

1166
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
All right.

1167
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
GS68, I'm sorry, it's still 0-0.

1168
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Are you ready to match

1169
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
on this next one? Yes.

1170
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
All right, GS68 says yes. Here we go.

1171
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Next question.

1172
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Loki recently

1173
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
confessed to a big crime.

1174
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
He

1175
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.

1176
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
When

1177
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
the police asked him to confess,

1178
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
he confessed. Yes, I

1179
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
did it. I hacked PlayStation.com

1180
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
because the website

1181
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
didn't have enough blank.

1182
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Fucking ding.

1183
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Loki hacked PlayStation.com

1184
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
and said yes, I did it. I hacked

1185
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
PlayStation.com because the website didn't

1186
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
have enough blank. Ding.

1187
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We're done.

1188
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm still thinking.

1189
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Um, dang.

1190
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You should already have this since you wrote this question.

1191
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Yeah, that doesn't mean I have an answer.

1192
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Name this question

1193
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
in the form of a walrus.

1194
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
All right, I'm

1195
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
going for that one. All right.

1196
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
It sounds like everybody's dinged.

1197
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Oh, I didn't copy paste the question to RapidSlasher.

1198
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Shit, he's probably still thinking.

1199
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Bad host, no cookie.

1200
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Please

1201
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
hurry.

1202
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Because I'm slow that time. All right.

1203
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Back with the music. Well, RapidSlasher,

1204
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
thanks. Loki recently confessed to a big

1205
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
crime. He was the one that hacked PlayStation.com.

1206
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
When the police asked him

1207
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
to confess, he confessed. Yes, I did it.

1208
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I hacked PlayStation.com because the website

1209
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
didn't have enough. All right, we got

1210
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
an answer from RapidSlasher. So,

1211
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
GS68, the website didn't

1212
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
have enough pylons.

1213
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Cylons.

1214
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Oh, pylons.

1215
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Sorry, I thought he was going for an old O-L-R in jokes.

1216
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Pylons. Didn't have enough pylons.

1217
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
RapidSlasher said it didn't have

1218
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
enough tits.

1219
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Old standby answer. All right,

1220
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
there we go. So, pylons and tits.

1221
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Rama, the website did not

1222
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
have enough prawn.

1223
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Prawn.

1224
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Not a match with tits. Not a match with tits.

1225
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Prawn is not tits.

1226
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Prawn is wannabe tits. All right.

1227
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Darktitsuya, the website didn't have enough

1228
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Iraqi suicide

1229
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
babies. Iraqi suicide

1230
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
babies, says Darktitsuya.

1231
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Drew, by the

1232
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
way, for those that are new to the O-L-R,

1233
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Iraqi suicide babies, like that's a match game joke

1234
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
dating back to like episode 30.

1235
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
All right. Drew,

1236
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
the website did not construct

1237
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
additional pylons. Oh,

1238
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
pylons. Wow, that's a match. I don't get the joke.

1239
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
What's the joke? It's a Starcraft joke.

1240
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Oh, my God.

1241
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
The guy that made the over 9,000

1242
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
oh, my God. All right.

1243
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Well, shit, that's a match. Congratulations.

1244
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
GS68 is on the board with a point. That's a

1245
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
match for pylons. All right. Loki,

1246
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
the website did not have enough

1247
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
cleavage. Cleavage. Is that

1248
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
a match with tits, judges? No, because

1249
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
cleavage is the... It's

1250
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
a match.

1251
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
It's a match. I will say a half

1252
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
point. A half point for rapid slasher.

1253
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
A half point. A half point for

1254
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
rapid slasher. Hey, S, I am the only person in this room

1255
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that possesses said substance.

1256
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
All right.

1257
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
There you go. DarkSakura, he

1258
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
didn't have enough fuck?

1259
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
PlayStation.com didn't have enough

1260
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
fuck?

1261
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
All right.

1262
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Needs

1263
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
meat making fuck about

1264
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Resurka. All right, and my answer,

1265
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
the website didn't have enough

1266
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Iraqi suicide babies.

1267
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I also went with the old stand by OLR joke.

1268
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
All

1269
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
right, could have gotten you two points, but there you have it.

1270
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
All right. One more

1271
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
question. A chance for rapid slasher to

1272
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
take over the lead. Are you worried, GS68?

1273
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
No.

1274
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I think

1275
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
that was a no. It was very quiet. All right.

1276
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Here we go. Question number

1277
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
three, and it's the last one, so

1278
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
your last chance to make

1279
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
a lot of points. Here we go.

1280
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The question is,

1281
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Jamie is very happy

1282
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
to finally see an evil

1283
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
woman robot appear in the new

1284
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Mega Man game. However,

1285
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
she was very disappointed to hear about the name.

1286
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Splash Woman,

1287
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
she exclaimed, screw that.

1288
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
If I made an evil robot,

1289
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
it would be Blank Woman.

1290
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Ding.

1291
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Jamie was very happy to see an evil woman

1292
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
robot appear in the new Mega Man game,

1293
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
but she doesn't like the name Splash Woman. She said,

1294
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
if I had an evil robot, it

1295
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
would be Blank Woman.

1296
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Ding.

1297
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Ding.

1298
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Ding.

1299
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
All right.

1300
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm waiting for rapid slasher's

1301
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
answer. Everybody in the studio good to go?

1302
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Everybody in the studio looks good.

1303
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
We're just waiting on our

1304
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
chatter.

1305
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Whistling.

1306
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Chatter, if you need help,

1307
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
there's tons of answers in chat right now.

1308
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I like some of

1309
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
these answers. By the way, some of the

1310
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
answers we have for the previous one,

1311
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
on the website,

1312
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
website didn't have enough eye

1313
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
of judgment, worthwhile

1314
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
content,

1315
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
porn, hentai,

1316
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
super bacon, website

1317
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
didn't have enough shots, that's a good one, that would have been a good one.

1318
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
All right, and then the

1319
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
other one, the first game I was going to play

1320
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
naked, Captain Commando.

1321
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I like that one, says

1322
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Shauran. Boom Blox,

1323
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Texas Hold'em.

1324
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
All right,

1325
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
it looks like we have an answer from

1326
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Rapid Slasher, so GS68,

1327
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
you have to answer first because you're on the phone.

1328
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
If I made an evil robot,

1329
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
her name would be...

1330
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Dick Woman.

1331
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Sorry, say that one more time?

1332
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Dick Woman.

1333
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Did I hear that right? Dick Woman.

1334
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
All right.

1335
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
All right, Dick Woman.

1336
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I think that might defeat the point of being a woman, but we'll see.

1337
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
You never know. All our listeners have come up with

1338
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
crazier things and matched.

1339
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Rapid Slasher says if I made an evil robot, it would be

1340
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Ferret Woman.

1341
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
All right, getting a little warmer

1342
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I think. Let's see, Ferret Woman

1343
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
and Dick Woman. Rama,

1344
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
if I made an evil robot, says

1345
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Dark Soccer, the name would be...

1346
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I said Guinness Woman.

1347
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Guinness Woman.

1348
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Very well done. Very well done.

1349
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That's a good one. All right, Dark Tetsuya, her name would be...

1350
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
A bit cliche, but

1351
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Bionic Woman. Bionic Woman.

1352
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Why not? Her name is Jamie Summers. Why not?

1353
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Good answer. Good answer. All right,

1354
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Drew, the name would be...

1355
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Ferret Woman. Ferret Woman. Oh my

1356
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
gosh, a match. And with that,

1357
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Rapid Slasher takes the lead to

1358
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
one and a half versus one. All right,

1359
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
let's see. Loki,

1360
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
the evil robot's name would be...

1361
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Bitch, get back in the kitchen and make me dinner.

1362
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Woman.

1363
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I don't think Dark

1364
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Sakura would actually say that. I think it might

1365
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
be wrong, but I...

1366
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Whoa, we...

1367
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Uh oh, we just had Crash Bang Boom

1368
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
live in the studio. That's all right.

1369
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Man down. I heard Broken

1370
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Glass. That can't be good.

1371
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Uh oh, what?

1372
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Oh, fun. That's all right.

1373
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Dark Sakura.

1374
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Wow, that's crazy. Did you hear that on Justin

1375
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
TV? That's something else. Dark Sakura, her name

1376
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
would be... Woman. She doesn't

1377
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
need anything else.

1378
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That's all you need to know.

1379
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That would be pretty

1380
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
evil.

1381
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
All right, I got the finger.

1382
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
All right, here it is in my answer. Here it is.

1383
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
If I said Dick Woman, then GS68

1384
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
wins. My answer,

1385
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
if I made an evil robot,

1386
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
her name would be... Sniper

1387
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Woman. Sniper Woman.

1388
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Which, unfortunately, is not a match, which means

1389
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Rapid Slasher wins

1390
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
in a narrow victory of one and a half to

1391
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
one. GS68,

1392
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I'm sorry you're the loser

1393
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
tonight. So, uh,

1394
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
is there any final words you have?

1395
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I am already...

1396
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Oh, sorry, you get hung up on because you lost.

1397
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
All right. Hey, that's what the

1398
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
losers get. I'm sorry. Poned.

1399
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Oh, come on. GS68's been on the show a

1400
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
million times. Nothing, nothing there.

1401
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
He knows the rules. Rapid Slasher,

1402
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
if you have anything you want to plug,

1403
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
send me a private message and I will

1404
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
plug it. As the winner, you get to plug

1405
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
whatever you want. Meanwhile, Loki's

1406
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
going to get to the next story while I assess the

1407
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
damage. Yes. Of the party

1408
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
foul. Uh, there is another

1409
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
rumor of a game coming out now

1410
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
for, I believe, the PSP.

1411
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
And, uh, this would make

1412
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
sense, um, since,

1413
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
well, they've had other

1414
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
similar collections on the PSP

1415
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
as well. It is the Star

1416
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Soldier collection. It's supposed to

1417
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
contain, um,

1418
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
four different Star Soldier games,

1419
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
including Star Soldier,

1420
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
um, let's see,

1421
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Final Soldier and

1422
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Soldier Blade. And

1423
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
one other one, um, oh,

1424
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Super Star Soldier, I guess, as well.

1425
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
So that's kind of

1426
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
cool. Oh, I'm sorry. And, um,

1427
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I got this all wrong here.

1428
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Super Star Soldier, Final Soldier, Soldier Blade,

1429
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and Star Parodia.

1430
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Star Parodia?

1431
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And it would retail, I guess,

1432
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
in Japan for, uh, 2940 yen,

1433
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
which is less than, uh,

1434
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
30 dollars US.

1435
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I do want this. Star Parodia is, like,

1436
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
the best game ever. Haven't, like, done

1437
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Star Parodia on a classic

1438
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
game? Uh, possibly.

1439
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I think you did one form of Parodius or another.

1440
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I don't know if it was that specific one. No, it's not Parodius. It has nothing to do with Parodius.

1441
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
My bad. Star Parodia is a parody of

1442
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Star Soldier. That, I don't think you've done.

1443
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm all about Star Soldier myself, so

1444
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
do want.

1445
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Alright. Sounds pretty awesome.

1446
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It's funny, though, because on the little screen shot that they have

1447
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
or box shot or whatever it is, they have a bunch of

1448
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
the Bomberman guys running around.

1449
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Alright.

1450
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I never saw RapidSlasher send, uh, something he

1451
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
wanted to plug in private message, so, uh,

1452
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I guess, uh, that's that.

1453
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
We'll see. Maybe after this story.

1454
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Uh, Burnout Paradise, this is

1455
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
one of those games I played for a couple days and I was like,

1456
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
eh, I'm over it, which is sad because

1457
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Burnout was, uh, such a fun series, but

1458
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
you know, hats off to the

1459
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
folks at Criterion because they keep trying to

1460
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
invent new ways to make the game more fun.

1461
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Uh, granted they had a patch of theirs get pushed

1462
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
back a little bit, but guess what's

1463
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
coming for the next patch? This is very

1464
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
interesting. Um, Criterion

1465
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
is considering after this whole Cagney update

1466
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
is done, they're gonna put planes

1467
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
in Burnout Paradise.

1468
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Yes. Planes.

1469
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Like pilot wings. Planes.

1470
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'd like, I'd like to see an airborne

1471
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
takedown. That could be very

1472
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
interesting, but I worry about

1473
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
all the fan videos on YouTube we're gonna see.

1474
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I want free running to be in there.

1475
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I want people just running and then

1476
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
running into other people and that,

1477
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
that's what's gonna happen. They're gonna explode and

1478
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
like crash. I will say though, referring

1479
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
to an earlier story in the evening, um,

1480
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
it would be pretty awesome to fly the

1481
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
plane in Burnout Paradise, uh, with a

1482
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
custom soundtrack playing Danger Zone.

1483
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It's getting ridiculous

1484
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
now, seriously. Danger Zone.

1485
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Alright, maybe not. You know, Hamster. It's gonna

1486
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
be Hamster and Hamster Bowl and it's, you know,

1487
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
right across the street. Don't, don't

1488
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
give them ideas. Please don't give them ideas.

1489
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Alright, we got one more story for

1490
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
you and then the Skype line will be open

1491
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
at 1877 Game OLR. Our username

1492
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but

1493
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
having the last word tonight on the news,

1494
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
DarkSakura. Hells yeah,

1495
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I am. Um,

1496
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
one of the, uh,

1497
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'd have to say best RPG series ever,

1498
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Let Me Untangle Myself.

1499
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's not called Let Me Untangle Myself.

1500
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
That would be a pretty fun RPG. Um,

1501
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
it's a fantasy star

1502
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and they're doing a fantasy star portable.

1503
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
There's a demo that is

1504
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
actually, um, out, um,

1505
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
uh,

1506
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
let me see if I can find it. Yeah, on

1507
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
the official website, I do believe, at

1508
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
fantasystar.sega.jp

1509
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
slash psp. Um,

1510
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
that's got new characters and, uh,

1511
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
some downloadable content and

1512
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
the demo is going to be out on July 14th

1513
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
and the game will be out on the 31st, but

1514
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
that is Japan only.

1515
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Um, and it will be 301 megabytes

1516
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
in size.

1517
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Sounds interesting. The demo, sorry.

1518
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Could be fun. It's supposed to be,

1519
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
as I say, an extensive demo.

1520
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You can access story

1521
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
mode and multi-mode.

1522
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Alright. And you can bring your, um, save data

1523
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
from the demo to the final game.

1524
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Alright. I got the

1525
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
plugs from Rapid Slasher before, uh,

1526
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
we get to tonight's Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR

1527
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1528
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Uh, Rapid Slasher would like to plug his YouTube

1529
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
channel, available at YouTube.com

1530
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
slash user slash Rapid Slasher.

1531
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
And I'm looking at it right now. It looks like he has a two

1532
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
girls, one cup reaction video.

1533
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Oh, those are always fun. It looks like,

1534
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
looks like, uh, friend is watching it

1535
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
on a cell phone there or something. So there you have it.

1536
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And a video called Chewbacca, which,

1537
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
um, I can only imagine what that is.

1538
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Stop it.

1539
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Rapid Slasher would also like to say, Indiana

1540
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
represent, and go see Radiohead

1541
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
this summer.

1542
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Radiohead. Alright.

1543
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I didn't know Radiohead was going out on tour.

1544
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
They have an album out.

1545
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
They have a Rainbows album. Dark Sakura, we might have to

1546
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
go do that. I love Radiohead. I'm thinking that.

1547
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Except Thom Yorke is nuts.

1548
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Alright. Look, before we get to the Skype line tonight,

1549
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
we have a very special late-breaking

1550
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
report, like live stuff going on right now.

1551
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Um, we're going to our OLR correspondent

1552
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
who's on the line. Are you there?

1553
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yeah. How's it going, guys?

1554
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Good. Who is this?

1555
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
This is DJ Tyrant. Well, hello, DJ Tyrant.

1556
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Uh, folks around these parts might

1557
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
remember you from STFU,

1558
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
which once aired on the Orange Lounge back when it was

1559
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
a network. Yeah, that was

1560
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
a lot of fun. Which feels like so long ago

1561
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
now. It's so sad. But DJ Tyrant

1562
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
still does some freelance stuff for us and uses

1563
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
our name to get into places. So, uh,

1564
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
what did you use our name to get into

1565
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
this week?

1566
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Uh, I went to Anime Expo, which actually just

1567
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
ended today, and I just got

1568
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
home about an hour ago.

1569
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And I got to play some games that aren't

1570
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
out yet. Got to check out some stuff.

1571
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Okay, first question I've got to ask.

1572
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Anime Expo gets a little bit of a bad

1573
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
rap out there in the community.

1574
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I've never been, so this is not a personal

1575
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
enti- That's okay, it sucks. But all I've

1576
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
ever heard is it sucks. Anime sucks.

1577
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Suckspo. Anime, you know.

1578
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Does it still suck, or do you

1579
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
think people might need to pay at another visit?

1580
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I think people might

1581
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
need to pay at another visit, because they've restructured

1582
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
a lot of the upper people,

1583
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and it seems a lot more organized

1584
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
now. Did it suck as bad

1585
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
as last year, as DarkSira?

1586
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Oh no, it was- it was

1587
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
much improved over the last year. I heard that that thing could suck

1588
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
as badly as last year has ever sucked.

1589
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Last year was pretty bad.

1590
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
In order to come up, you've got to hit rock bottom

1591
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
first, so there you go. Rock bottom. There it is.

1592
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Yo, how many, uh, rabid

1593
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Odon Host Club fangirls did you have to

1594
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
push your way through to get to the games?

1595
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Uh, too many.

1596
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Let's talk about games. What type of video

1597
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
game stuff did you see at Anime Expo?

1598
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Uh, lots and lots of fighting games,

1599
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
because that seems to be pretty much 90%

1600
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
of any anime video game.

1601
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Fair enough.

1602
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Were there lots of fighting games based on

1603
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
animes, like any particular ones that jump out in your mind?

1604
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Uh, yeah, well, the typical

1605
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Naruto games. Namco had their

1606
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
PS3 Naruto game,

1607
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
and that looked really good. The graphics were really

1608
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
nice on that. Um, and D3

1609
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
had their Wii

1610
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Naruto fighting game, and

1611
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
so that's probably not going to be

1612
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
that great, because

1613
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
it's on the Wii, and Wii fighting games

1614
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
generally are not that great. What was that, Logan?

1615
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I was going to say, which, by the way, if you want to play the demo for the

1616
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
PS3 one, you can download the second episode of

1617
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Core, and they have an

1618
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
exclusive demo in there. Huh. Are you

1619
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
subscribed to Core? No, but I read it. Oh, sorry.

1620
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I ain't buying that. What the hell?

1621
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It's not stupid. Sorry, Jimmy. What else

1622
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
was there? Uh, I went to

1623
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
actually Arc System Works

1624
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
panel, which does Guilty Gear,

1625
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
and they showed off

1626
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
a couple trailers for some games that are

1627
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
coming out. Uh, Castle Sh-

1628
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Shikigami 3, which is a Wii

1629
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
title, it's, uh, another

1630
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
one of those shumps. Yeah, it's, uh,

1631
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
really beautiful.

1632
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
And it looks a lot like

1633
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Ikaruga.

1634
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
That was, like, fun. Were there any non-fighting

1635
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
games there? Or was that, like, all you saw?

1636
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Um, that was all that was

1637
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
pretty much playable. I mean, so Calibur IV was

1638
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
playable. It looked really,

1639
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
really beautiful. Wow.

1640
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Street Fighter IV? Did you get some h-

1641
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Yeah, Street Fighter IV? Uh, Street Fighter-

1642
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Capcom was not there, so Street Fighter IV was

1643
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
not there. Well, tell us more about Soul Calibur IV.

1644
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Did you get some hands-on play with Soul Calibur IV? How was it?

1645
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Uh, no, I didn't,

1646
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
but it looked pretty much

1647
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
like a standard Soul Calibur game. I mean,

1648
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
there were only three playable characters, none

1649
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
of the exclusives, no Darth Vader or Yoda

1650
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
or, uh, Kratos, just kidding.

1651
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Haha, funny.

1652
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Yeah, um, another one

1653
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
from Arc System's work was Battle Fantasia,

1654
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
which I got to spend some time with.

1655
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It's, um, another

1656
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
fighting game, but it's exclusive for the

1657
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
360. It'll have, uh,

1658
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Xbox Live Play coming out, I think,

1659
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
September 16th, they said.

1660
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
There is a PS3 version. Very similar to

1661
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Third Strike in that there's, uh,

1662
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
a parry system in it.

1663
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
You hit the R1 shoulder

1664
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
button, and the next attack is parried.

1665
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And if you do it and there's

1666
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
no attack, you, there's kind of a

1667
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
cooldown from when you can attack again.

1668
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Yeah, I know there is a PS3 version

1669
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
of that, because I'm actually trying to get a friend

1670
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
right now who's over in Japan to import it

1671
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
for me, but, um, I'm surprised

1672
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
they're not localizing that. Probably paid

1673
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
exclusively. Uh, yeah, that came up a lot during

1674
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
their panel. Everyone was like, are you bringing it over for

1675
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
a PS3? And they haven't made any

1676
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
announcements yet for that.

1677
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Um, they also

1678
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
showed a trailer for that, uh,

1679
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
what was it? The, the

1680
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Phoenix Wright style game that Jack

1681
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Hunter, and that was

1682
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
kind of funny to see that, because it looks

1683
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
almost exactly like, uh,

1684
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Phoenix Wright. Did you see, uh,

1685
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Blue Blaze Calamity Trigger?

1686
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, I saw the game, and

1687
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
the line was just huge for it. And it

1688
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
looks very similar to,

1689
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
uh, the Guilty Gear XX series.

1690
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Um, has the same style of gameplay.

1691
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
And,

1692
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
um, there's a blocking system in it

1693
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
that I, I got to check it out.

1694
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And on that top bar, if you

1695
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
played Street Fighter Alpha 3,

1696
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
there's a, there's a guard meter where you can

1697
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
only guard so much. Um,

1698
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and it's separate in that game, but in this game,

1699
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
both people share it, so I can see

1700
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
some strategies playing out because of that.

1701
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
I, I'm a little surprised that you didn't

1702
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
see more, like, RPGs,

1703
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
MMOs from little companies,

1704
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
and all that kind of stuff at all. I, I saw

1705
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
a ton of the little MMOs, I mean,

1706
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
uh, MapleStory, um,

1707
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
they got me to sign up for that. I'll

1708
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
check it out. Sucker. Probably.

1709
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Yeah. Well, they gave me $10

1710
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
in free, uh, um,

1711
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
nickel and

1712
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
dime-ing DLC or whatever it is.

1713
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Was it worth selling your soul?

1714
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I, I hadn't sold my soul yet.

1715
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Alright.

1716
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Yet. Keyword. Alright.

1717
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Uh, Jimmy, before we

1718
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
let you go, we gotta know, thank you for giving us

1719
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
the fill on what we miss on Anime Expo, but I gotta know,

1720
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
best cosplay and

1721
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
worst cosplay? Oh, yeah.

1722
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Oh, boy, uh,

1723
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
my favorite cosplay

1724
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
is probably a Captain Falcon that looks

1725
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
pretty, pretty darn good.

1726
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I thought it was pretty funny. Nice.

1727
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Um, worst cosplay?

1728
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Um, any of the, the females

1729
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
that really didn't need to be

1730
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
in skimpy outfits?

1731
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh, god. There you have it.

1732
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I mean, you have that at every con, though, so,

1733
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I don't know. Alright.

1734
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's just not appealing.

1735
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Alright. David Hader's awesome.

1736
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I assume that no cosplayers got

1737
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
shot being in LA?

1738
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
No. I don't know why everyone assumes that.

1739
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I'm shocked.

1740
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Alright, well, uh, DJ Tyrant,

1741
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I'll see you at BlizzCon. We're in a nicer area.

1742
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Yeah, definitely. It'll be a blast.

1743
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
It will. Alright. Take care,

1744
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Jimmy. Thanks, guys. Take care.

1745
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Thanks for being on the show.

1746
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Alright, we like hearing from Jimmy, and I'm glad he has a place

1747
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
to come on and talk, sadly, because STFU

1748
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
is no more. It's sad.

1749
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But there is, uh, STFU is kind of combined

1750
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
now. You know, you got half of STFU.

1751
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
You got DMN, and you got Travis Donovan.

1752
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
They do a show together here on

1753
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
All Games Radio. It's Understation Live. It airs

1754
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Saturday nights, and it was the show I started on

1755
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
years ago, and Dark Soccer was a guest

1756
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
like 50 million times.

1757
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
So, there you have it. Alright, if you want to give us a call,

1758
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, and

1759
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
it's already ringing. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

1760
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Hey, this is the

1761
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
other New Yorker, SSJ100 Matt.

1762
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Well, hello, SSJ100 Matt, and you see

1763
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I switch shirts during the break.

1764
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I don't know if you're looking to just TV right now, but I've got

1765
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
the I Heart NY shirt on right now,

1766
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
just for you cats. There you go.

1767
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Yo, what's up, Matt? Yeah, if I got a Sharpie,

1768
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I can write IN BED underneath it.

1769
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

1770
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
The whole town. No, what's on your mind, SSJ100 Matt?

1771
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
What was that?

1772
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
What is on your mind tonight?

1773
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Nothing. I'm

1774
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
pretty hyped up about, uh, the greatest game

1775
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
ever made, uh,

1776
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
um, well, according not

1777
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
to you, and not according to you,

1778
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
but, uh, Chrono Trigger.

1779
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Chrono, no, you're right, not according to me,

1780
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
but I still think it's pretty darn good, and, uh,

1781
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
you know, not even as good as some of the Final Fantasy

1782
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
games I've played, but that's alright.

1783
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Even I will probably get the

1784
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Chrono Trigger remake on DS. There was this, like,

1785
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
collective explosion of fan

1786
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
gasm on the internet this week when that was announced.

1787
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That was pretty crazy. So, uh,

1788
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
it's just like my Live Journal friends list exploded,

1789
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
and I'm sure people's Twitters, uh,

1790
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
blew themselves up as well. Um,

1791
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
what would you, as a Chrono Trigger,

1792
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
um, fan, uh,

1793
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
really want to see in this, uh,

1794
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
new DS version, Matt?

1795
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Well, I assume, you know, it's gonna

1796
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
be based on, like, the SNES

1797
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
version, but, um, I think, you know, just

1798
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
keep everything the way it was,

1799
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and, uh, I think they said they were gonna

1800
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
add more dungeons and online

1801
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
play. That's fine with me.

1802
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
So, I mean, I beat the game

1803
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
10,000 times

1804
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
since it's come out, so...

1805
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
What would you have thought, Matt, if

1806
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
it turned out that this game was a 3D remake

1807
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
in the same vein as Final Fantasy 3 and

1808
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Final Fantasy 4? Would you have been a little scared, or what?

1809
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I probably would have been a little scared,

1810
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
and I probably still would have bought it.

1811
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Still would have bought it, just to

1812
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
support Chrono Trigger, but a little

1813
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
bit apprehensively.

1814
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
You know, maybe if we buy, if we each

1815
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
buy 50 copies, they'll make, uh, Radical

1816
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Dreamers, or some sort of

1817
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
dream on. Yeah, dream

1818
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
on with that one. You never know. You never know.

1819
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Stranger things have happened, so there you have it.

1820
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Well, I, um, I

1821
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
have my fingers crossed that Chrono Trigger

1822
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
will do the fans justice. I have not

1823
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
played the game in so long. I haven't played Chrono Trigger

1824
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
since I was a kid, so it'll be fun to revisit

1825
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
that series. You know what, it's good

1826
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
because, you know, a lot of the younger

1827
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
generation who, like, were born in the 90s,

1828
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
they'll actually get a chance to play this, because, you know,

1829
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I'm sure there's plenty of people in the chat room

1830
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
who've never played it before, so...

1831
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I am kinda curious, though, how the whole two-screen

1832
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
thing's gonna work. I'm very curious

1833
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
to see what they do with that, so, uh, we'll be waiting

1834
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
for, uh, some more screenshots and stuff.

1835
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
If they make it 3D, they better do it justice.

1836
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
They're not. It's Sprite. It's old-school

1837
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Sprite. Alright.

1838
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Well, Matt, thank you so much for calling in. Any other last words

1839
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
you wanna say real quick?

1840
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Well, yeah, two things. Um, when, when are you guys

1841
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
coming out to New York again?

1842
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Tough to say.

1843
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I'm gonna aim for the spring,

1844
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
because I do wanna see my friend that lives out there.

1845
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
It's not gonna happen for digital life. I'll tell you that much

1846
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
just because of Penny Arcade Expo and everything else.

1847
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
But I'm gonna aim for spring.

1848
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
That's cool.

1849
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So, we'll see.

1850
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
What's the second thing?

1851
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Uh, this is for, uh, dark to see you.

1852
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Sir?

1853
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe. Hey, Joe.

1854
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
What?

1855
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Wait a minute. When have I heard that before?

1856
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Sounds familiar. Alright.

1857
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Later, Matt. For that, you get hung up on it.

1858
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Alright.

1859
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

1860
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

1861
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
We've got room for about, how long are we running this?

1862
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Ooh, shit, we're almost to an hour and a half.

1863
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Maybe, like, one more call on the Skype line at Orange Lounge Radio.

1864
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
1-877-GAME-OLR

1865
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

1866
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Sack anime a little closer to home

1867
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
last week of August. Be there.

1868
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Oh, it's, it's Penny Arcade Expo.

1869
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Same weekend. Can't do it. Sorry, guys.

1870
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Sorry.

1871
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Fine. I'll go.

1872
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
They do, like, five sack animes a year.

1873
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
They do two.

1874
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
There seems like there's a con at the Masonic Center every month.

1875
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
They have two sack animes a month

1876
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
and, sorry, two sack animes a year

1877
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and four sack animes a month.

1878
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I wish. And, uh,

1879
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
four smaller sack comic cons

1880
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
a year. Alright.

1881
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Thank you for the local news.

1882
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Do it. I love Sunrise Mall. That's awesome. Alright.

1883
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Here we go. Look. We'll stop, stop with the local chat.

1884
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Let's talk to somebody on the Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1885
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Who's this?

1886
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Oh, hi. Um.

1887
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I spaced out there for a sec. This is Golden Banjo.

1888
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
That's alright. The heat is making us spacey, too,

1889
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
but it's starting to cool off a little bit, thank God.

1890
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Actually, it's not as bad over here in New England

1891
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
and New Hampshire, but

1892
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
I feel bad for you guys.

1893
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
That's alright. You guys have to deal with humidity.

1894
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
At least we don't have that. Well, what's on your mind, buddy?

1895
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Um, well, actually,

1896
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
I'm one of those Chrono Trigger people

1897
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and, uh, well, once again,

1898
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
I know you might not be as crazy about it.

1899
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
I don't actually even know

1900
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
much about the game and I know

1901
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
that I have to play it.

1902
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
So, that just goes to show you.

1903
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
How old are you, if you don't mind me asking?

1904
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
No, that's fine.

1905
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I'm about 16, so.

1906
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
See, I think that's what it is. So, you were probably,

1907
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
like, when these games first came out, God, if I was, like,

1908
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
16 when those games came out, then you were, like,

1909
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
one or two when those games first came out.

1910
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
God, I'm old.

1911
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I think that's the whole thing that Matt was saying earlier,

1912
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
is that this will really allow a whole new generation

1913
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
to experience it, which is kind of cool.

1914
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So, it's kind of interesting. They're not changing

1915
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
a whole lot and modernizing it, but I guess with the classic,

1916
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
you don't have to. I mean, you don't modernize old movies.

1917
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Then again, sometimes Turner

1918
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
colorizes them and all that stuff.

1919
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But, yeah, it'll be interesting.

1920
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And I don't hate Chrono Trigger by any means.

1921
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Just because I didn't name it my favorite game of all time

1922
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
doesn't mean I hate it.

1923
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
There's other games I like a little more,

1924
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
but I also really like Chrono Trigger

1925
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
quite a bit and I respect it as

1926
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
a great RPG game.

1927
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
So, no hatin' in this camp.

1928
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
No hatin'.

1929
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
And to the new generation, do it or I'll come over the

1930
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
internet and kick your ass.

1931
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
New generation, ugh.

1932
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
So old.

1933
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Go Banjo, anything else you want to share with

1934
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
our listeners tonight?

1935
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
No, I just wanted to call in and say that real quick.

1936
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Alright.

1937
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Alright, that's pretty much it.

1938
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Have a good night, guys.

1939
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You too, have fun with Chrono Trigger DS whenever it comes out.

1940
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Probably will be the hardest.

1941
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Okay, I'm definitely looking forward to that.

1942
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Call back and let us know what you think, young whippersnapper.

1943
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Okay, you too.

1944
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Alright, get off my lawn.

1945
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
He hung up. Okay, bye.

1946
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Alright, nice.

1947
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Very nice. Alright, we're gonna

1948
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
go ahead and close up the Skyblind for tonight

1949
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
so we can close out the rest of the show.

1950
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Big sorry and boo-hoo to those of you

1951
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
who didn't get through, but please try again next week.

1952
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Quickly, before we close out tonight, some last

1953
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
minute stories. Dark Soccer, you have anything

1954
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
tonight? Sometimes you have some tidbits

1955
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
for us? It's hot.

1956
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Yes, Hot Garage is very hot, but thankfully

1957
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
it's cool. It's getting a little more bearable in here now.

1958
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Loki, any last minute stories

1959
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
from you tonight?

1960
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I've

1961
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
never really been looking at

1962
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
stories, unfortunately, because I've been too busy

1963
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
working on stuff.

1964
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Let's see here.

1965
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Trying to see if there was anything we missed.

1966
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Real quick.

1967
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I tried to hit on all the big stuff tonight. I don't think there was anything we missed.

1968
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah. I hope not.

1969
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'll be sad.

1970
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Oh, I know one thing that we didn't talk about.

1971
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They're actually...

1972
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I'm not sure if this is really headway, you'd really

1973
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
call it, but someone's gotten

1974
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
homebrewed run a little bit

1975
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
on a PS3 using

1976
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Swap Magic.

1977
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And apparently they had

1978
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
an elf loader on there that

1979
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
they were able to run

1980
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
a Genesis emulator.

1981
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
So that's kind of

1982
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
interesting. On what now?

1983
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
It's a program called Swap Magic.

1984
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
It was like one of those things to run

1985
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
on PlayStation 3.

1986
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
You know, run, I guess, burn games

1987
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
and stuff like that, or region-free stuff

1988
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
on the PlayStation 2, but they

1989
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
ran it on the PlayStation 3

1990
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and were able to play a Genesis emulator on there.

1991
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I mean, sure, you could run Linux

1992
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
or something like that on your

1993
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
other operating system on that and

1994
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
easily run games that way, but

1995
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
that's not as fun.

1996
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
So, that was one thing that was

1997
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
kind of interesting.

1998
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Let's see.

1999
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Also, the

2000
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Wrath of the Lich King beta signups

2001
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
are open.

2002
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Don't tell people because I want the key.

2003
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Well, actually, speaking of

2004
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
things we missed, if you were

2005
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
an UruLive fan,

2006
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
a Missed Online fan,

2007
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
on GameTap, they are pulling

2008
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
that, the publishers are taking it back

2009
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
and apparently going to revive the community.

2010
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oh, good for them.

2011
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
That's good. There was definitely a community

2012
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
behind it.

2013
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
There you have it.

2014
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
We've got some other things here real quick.

2015
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Bomberman is coming to

2016
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
the iPhone with Bomberman Touch,

2017
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
which is interesting.

2018
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And

2019
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
also,

2020
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I guess a game, the UK

2021
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
retailer is going

2022
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
to start publishing some independent games.

2023
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Which is

2024
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
weird. That's interesting to have a retailer

2025
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
doing that at the front like that.

2026
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Exclusives. Can you say exclusives?

2027
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And Sony, I guess, is putting out

2028
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
another game that's going to be

2029
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
coming out in

2030
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
September, called Aqua.

2031
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And it's

2032
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
a sequel to Aquanauts

2033
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Holiday, which is sort of

2034
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
like Endless Ocean on the Wii.

2035
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So think of Africa, but under the sea.

2036
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
And it looks

2037
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
pretty cool, actually.

2038
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Also, there is a rumor that

2039
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Golf T it Up is

2040
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
supposed to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade

2041
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
next week. Whatever the hell that's

2042
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
supposed to be. But apparently it has its

2043
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Xbox.com page now, so

2044
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
that's on there. As well as, I guess,

2045
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Pirates vs Ninja's

2046
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Dodgeball. About time.

2047
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And then there's also a Guitar Hero

2048
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
homebrew game that's supposed to be coming out

2049
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
towards the

2050
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
end of August, August 20th.

2051
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It's called Video Game Hero.

2052
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Two of the tracks that they have on there,

2053
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Eye of the Tiger and Inspector Gadget.

2054
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It's the Inspector

2055
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Gadget theme, which both of them

2056
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
sound kind of like

2057
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
very midi

2058
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
sounding. But

2059
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
the game uses the touch screen

2060
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
or the directional buttons. It's kind of

2061
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
like Oda Jam, almost.

2062
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Which would be something else good to bring to the

2063
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
DS. Very interesting.

2064
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Alright. Well, that's going to do it

2065
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
for Last Minute Stories tonight, and we're about

2066
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
ready to wrap up the show. So, guys,

2067
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
thank you so much for coming to the show tonight and being here.

2068
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
And we'll start off with the final thoughts.

2069
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Intern Drew, you have a final thought?

2070
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Can we wrap up the show in an air-conditioned

2071
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
box? We can try.

2072
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Alright. Dartitsuya, any final thoughts?

2073
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
One second.

2074
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Uh-oh.

2075
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
What the hell is that?

2076
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Nice.

2077
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That little

2078
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
keychain thing.

2079
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Rama,

2080
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
your final thought?

2081
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
It's a Cyberman. You were wrong.

2082
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
It's a Cyberman.

2083
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Rama, your final thought?

2084
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Google Maps on my phone with

2085
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
GPS has been making me uber geek

2086
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
this entire weekend.

2087
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Geek. Nerd.

2088
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Damn proud of it.

2089
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
My final thought is...

2090
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
um...

2091
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
hot. Dark Sakura.

2092
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Exterminate the heat.

2093
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Loki.

2094
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Hot chair is hot.

2095
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Alright.

2096
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
That's going to do it for another episode of

2097
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Orange Laundry. Thanks so much for tuning in to us.

2098
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And remember, hey, we braved the heat.

2099
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
We do this every week for

2100
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
you guys, the listeners, for free.

2101
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
We don't get anything from doing this, contrary to popular

2102
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
belief. Nothing. We don't get paid by all games

2103
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
or none of that. It's

2104
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
all completely free for you guys. All we ask,

2105
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
guys, if you enjoy our show, tell somebody.

2106
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Spread the word. Tell two friends about

2107
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
the show. Post a nice review on iTunes.

2108
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Put something in your signature or something.

2109
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
That's all we ask. And a lot of you have done that.

2110
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Thank you guys so much for that.

2111
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
And thanks to that, independent

2112
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
internet radio will continue to live on.

2113
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
We suffer for your entertainment.

2114
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Do it.

2115
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
For another 286 episodes,

2116
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
we hope. Unless we pass out first.

2117
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
So until next week,

2118
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
pray for a

2119
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
rainstorm or some windstorms,

2120
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:36,000
and we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2121
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Right, anyway.

2122
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:26,000
See you next week.
